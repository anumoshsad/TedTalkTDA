VI'm a storyteller.
p4
aVAnd I would like to tell you a few personal stories
p5
aVabout what I like to call "the danger of the single story."
p6
aVI grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.
p7
aVMy mother says that I started reading at the age of two,
p8
aValthough I think four is probably close to the truth.
p9
aVSo I was an early reader,
p10
aVand what I read were British and American children's books.
p11
aa(lp12
VI was also an early writer,
p13
aVand when I began to write, at about the age of seven,
p14
aVstories in pencil with crayon illustrations
p15
aVthat my poor mother was obligated to read,
p16
aVI wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading:
p17
aVAll my characters were white and blue-eyed,
p18
aVthey played in the snow,
p19
aVthey ate apples,
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
Vand they talked a lot about the weather,
p24
aVhow lovely it was that the sun had come out.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.
p29
aVI had never been outside Nigeria.
p30
aVWe didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,
p31
aVand we never talked about the weather,
p32
aVbecause there was no need to.
p33
aa(lp34
VMy characters also drank a lot of ginger beer,
p35
aVbecause the characters in the British books I read
p36
aVdrank ginger beer.
p37
aVNever mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd for many years afterwards,
p42
aVI would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer.
p43
aVBut that is another story.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat this demonstrates, I think,
p46
aVis how impressionable and vulnerable we are
p47
aVin the face of a story,
p48
aVparticularly as children.
p49
aVBecause all I had read were books in which characters were foreign,
p50
aVI had become convinced that books
p51
aVby their very nature had to have foreigners in them
p52
aVand had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.
p53
aVNow, things changed when I discovered African books.
p54
aVThere weren't many of them available,
p55
aVand they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,
p58
aVI went through a mental shift in my perception of literature.
p59
aVI realized that people like me,
p60
aVgirls with skin the color of chocolate,
p61
aVwhose kinky hair could not form ponytails,
p62
aVcould also exist in literature.
p63
aVI started to write about things I recognized.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, I loved those American and British books I read.
p66
aVThey stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.
p67
aVBut the unintended consequence
p68
aVwas that I did not know that people like me
p69
aVcould exist in literature.
p70
aVSo what the discovery of African writers did for me was this:
p71
aVIt saved me from having a single story of what books are.
p72
aa(lp73
VI come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.
p74
aVMy father was a professor.
p75
aVMy mother was an administrator.
p76
aVAnd so we had, as was the norm,
p77
aVlive-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.
p78
aVSo, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy.
p79
aVHis name was Fide.
p80
aVThe only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor.
p81
aVMy mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family.
p82
aVAnd when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say,
p83
aV"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing."
p84
aVSo I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
p85
aa(lp86
VThen one Saturday, we went to his village to visit,
p87
aVand his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket
p88
aVmade of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
p89
aVI was startled.
p90
aVIt had not occurred to me that anybody in his family
p91
aVcould actually make something.
p92
aVAll I had heard about them was how poor they were,
p93
aVso that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor.
p94
aVTheir poverty was my single story of them.
p95
aa(lp96
VYears later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria
p97
aVto go to university in the United States.
p98
aVI was 19.
p99
aVMy American roommate was shocked by me.
p100
aVShe asked where I had learned to speak English so well,
p101
aVand was confused when I said that Nigeria
p102
aVhappened to have English as its official language.
p103
aVShe asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music,"
p104
aVand was consequently very disappointed
p105
aVwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VShe assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhat struck me was this:
p112
aVShe had felt sorry for me even before she saw me.
p113
aVHer default position toward me, as an African,
p114
aVwas a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.
p115
aVMy roommate had a single story of Africa:
p116
aVa single story of catastrophe.
p117
aVIn this single story,
p118
aVthere was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way,
p119
aVno possibility of feelings more complex than pity,
p120
aVno possibility of a connection as human equals.
p121
aa(lp122
VI must say that before I went to the U.S.,
p123
aVI didn't consciously identify as African.
p124
aVBut in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me.
p125
aVNever mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.
p126
aVBut I did come to embrace this new identity,
p127
aVand in many ways I think of myself now as African.
p128
aVAlthough I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country,
p129
aVthe most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight
p130
aVfrom Lagos two days ago,
p131
aVin which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight
p132
aVabout the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African,
p137
aVI began to understand my roommate's response to me.
p138
aVIf I had not grown up in Nigeria,
p139
aVand if all I knew about Africa were from popular images,
p140
aVI too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes,
p141
aVbeautiful animals,
p142
aVand incomprehensible people,
p143
aVfighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS,
p144
aVunable to speak for themselves
p145
aVand waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.
p146
aVI would see Africans in the same way that I,
p147
aVas a child, had seen Fide's family.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature.
p150
aVNow, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok,
p151
aVwho sailed to west Africa in 1561
p152
aVand kept a fascinating account of his voyage.
p153
aVAfter referring to the black Africans as "beasts who have no houses,"
p154
aVhe writes, "They are also people without heads,
p155
aVhaving their mouth and eyes in their breasts."
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, I've laughed every time I've read this.
p158
aVAnd one must admire the imagination of John Lok.
p159
aVBut what is important about his writing
p160
aVis that it represents the beginning
p161
aVof a tradition of telling African stories in the West:
p162
aVA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives,
p163
aVof difference, of darkness,
p164
aVof people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,
p165
aVare "half devil, half child."
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd so, I began to realize that my American roommate
p168
aVmust have throughout her life
p169
aVseen and heard different versions of this single story,
p170
aVas had a professor,
p171
aVwho once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."
p172
aVNow, I was quite willing to contend
p173
aVthat there were a number of things wrong with the novel,
p174
aVthat it had failed in a number of places,
p175
aVbut I had not quite imagined that it had failed
p176
aVat achieving something called African authenticity.
p177
aVIn fact, I did not know what African authenticity was.
p178
aVThe professor told me that my characters were too much like him,
p179
aVan educated and middle-class man.
p180
aVMy characters drove cars.
p181
aVThey were not starving.
p182
aVTherefore they were not authentically African.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty
p185
aVin the question of the single story.
p186
aVA few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.
p187
aVThe political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense,
p188
aVand there were debates going on about immigration.
p189
aVAnd, as often happens in America,
p190
aVimmigration became synonymous with Mexicans.
p191
aVThere were endless stories of Mexicans
p192
aVas people who were fleecing the healthcare system,
p193
aVsneaking across the border,
p194
aVbeing arrested at the border, that sort of thing.
p195
aa(lp196
VI remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara,
p197
aVwatching the people going to work,
p198
aVrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
p199
aVsmoking, laughing.
p200
aVI remember first feeling slight surprise.
p201
aVAnd then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
p202
aVI realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans
p203
aVthat they had become one thing in my mind,
p204
aVthe abject immigrant.
p205
aVI had bought into the single story of Mexicans
p206
aVand I could not have been more ashamed of myself.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo that is how to create a single story,
p209
aVshow a people as one thing,
p210
aVas only one thing,
p211
aVover and over again,
p212
aVand that is what they become.
p213
aa(lp214
VIt is impossible to talk about the single story
p215
aVwithout talking about power.
p216
aVThere is a word, an Igbo word,
p217
aVthat I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world,
p218
aVand it is "nkali."
p219
aVIt's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."
p220
aVLike our economic and political worlds,
p221
aVstories too are defined by the principle of nkali:
p222
aVHow they are told, who tells them,
p223
aVwhen they're told, how many stories are told,
p224
aVare really dependent on power.
p225
aa(lp226
VPower is the ability not just to tell the story of another person,
p227
aVbut to make it the definitive story of that person.
p228
aVThe Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes
p229
aVthat if you want to dispossess a people,
p230
aVthe simplest way to do it is to tell their story
p231
aVand to start with, "secondly."
p232
aVStart the story with the arrows of the Native Americans,
p233
aVand not with the arrival of the British,
p234
aVand you have an entirely different story.
p235
aVStart the story with the failure of the African state,
p236
aVand not with the colonial creation of the African state,
p237
aVand you have an entirely different story.
p238
aa(lp239
VI recently spoke at a university
p240
aVwhere a student told me that it was such a shame
p241
aVthat Nigerian men were physical abusers
p242
aVlike the father character in my novel.
p243
aVI told him that I had just read a novel called "American Psycho" \u2014
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
V\u2014 and that it was such a shame
p248
aVthat young Americans were serial murderers.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VBut it would never have occurred to me to think
p259
aVthat just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer
p260
aVthat he was somehow representative of all Americans.
p261
aVThis is not because I am a better person than that student,
p262
aVbut because of America's cultural and economic power,
p263
aVI had many stories of America.
p264
aVI had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
p265
aVI did not have a single story of America.
p266
aa(lp267
VWhen I learned, some years ago,
p268
aVthat writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods
p269
aVto be successful,
p270
aVI began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VBut the truth is that I had a very happy childhood,
p275
aVfull of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.
p278
aVMy cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.
p279
aVOne of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash
p280
aVbecause our fire trucks did not have water.
p281
aVI grew up under repressive military governments
p282
aVthat devalued education,
p283
aVso that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries.
p284
aVAnd so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,
p285
aVthen margarine disappeared,
p286
aVthen bread became too expensive,
p287
aVthen milk became rationed.
p288
aVAnd most of all, a kind of normalized political fear
p289
aVinvaded our lives.
p290
aa(lp291
VAll of these stories make me who I am.
p292
aVBut to insist on only these negative stories
p293
aVis to flatten my experience
p294
aVand to overlook the many other stories that formed me.
p295
aVThe single story creates stereotypes,
p296
aVand the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,
p297
aVbut that they are incomplete.
p298
aVThey make one story become the only story.
p299
aa(lp300
VOf course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes:
p301
aVThere are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo
p302
aVand depressing ones,
p303
aVsuch as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria.
p304
aVBut there are other stories that are not about catastrophe,
p305
aVand it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.
p306
aa(lp307
VI've always felt that it is impossible
p308
aVto engage properly with a place or a person
p309
aVwithout engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
p310
aVThe consequence of the single story is this:
p311
aVIt robs people of dignity.
p312
aVIt makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
p313
aVIt emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo what if before my Mexican trip,
p316
aVI had followed the immigration debate from both sides,
p317
aVthe U.S. and the Mexican?
p318
aVWhat if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor
p319
aVand hardworking?
p320
aVWhat if we had an African television network
p321
aVthat broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?
p322
aVWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls "a balance of stories."
p323
aa(lp324
VWhat if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher,
p325
aVMuhtar Bakare,
p326
aVa remarkable man who left his job in a bank
p327
aVto follow his dream and start a publishing house?
p328
aVNow, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.
p329
aVHe disagreed.
p330
aVHe felt that people who could read, would read,
p331
aVif you made literature affordable and available to them.
p332
aa(lp333
VShortly after he published my first novel,
p334
aVI went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview,
p335
aVand a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said,
p336
aV"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending.
p337
aVNow, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.
p342
aVI was not only charmed, I was very moved.
p343
aVHere was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians,
p344
aVwho were not supposed to be readers.
p345
aVShe had not only read the book,
p346
aVbut she had taken ownership of it
p347
aVand felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
p348
aa(lp349
VNow, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda,
p350
aVa fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos,
p351
aVand is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?
p352
aVWhat if my roommate knew about the heart procedure
p353
aVthat was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?
p354
aVWhat if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,
p355
aVtalented people singing in English and Pidgin,
p356
aVand Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,
p357
aVmixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela
p358
aVto Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
p359
aa(lp360
VWhat if my roommate knew about the female lawyer
p361
aVwho recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law
p362
aVthat required women to get their husband's consent
p363
aVbefore renewing their passports?
p364
aVWhat if my roommate knew about Nollywood,
p365
aVfull of innovative people making films despite great technical odds,
p366
aVfilms so popular
p367
aVthat they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
p368
aVWhat if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,
p369
aVwho has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
p370
aVOr about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail,
p371
aVbut continue to nurse ambition?
p372
aa(lp373
VEvery time I am home I am confronted
p374
aVwith the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians:
p375
aVour failed infrastructure, our failed government,
p376
aVbut also by the incredible resilience
p377
aVof people who thrive despite the government,
p378
aVrather than because of it.
p379
aVI teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer,
p380
aVand it is amazing to me how many people apply,
p381
aVhow many people are eager to write,
p382
aVto tell stories.
p383
aa(lp384
VMy Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit
p385
aVcalled Farafina Trust,
p386
aVand we have big dreams of building libraries
p387
aVand refurbishing libraries that already exist
p388
aVand providing books for state schools
p389
aVthat don't have anything in their libraries,
p390
aVand also of organizing lots and lots of workshops,
p391
aVin reading and writing,
p392
aVfor all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.
p393
aa(lp394
VStories matter.
p395
aVMany stories matter.
p396
aVStories have been used to dispossess and to malign,
p397
aVbut stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.
p398
aVStories can break the dignity of a people,
p399
aVbut stories can also repair that broken dignity.
p400
aa(lp401
VThe American writer Alice Walker wrote this
p402
aVabout her Southern relatives who had moved to the North.
p403
aVShe introduced them to a book about
p404
aVthe Southern life that they had left behind.
p405
aV"They sat around, reading the book themselves,
p406
aVlistening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."
p407
aa(lp408
VI would like to end with this thought:
p409
aVThat when we reject the single story,
p410
aVwhen we realize that there is never a single story
p411
aVabout any place,
p412
aVwe regain a kind of paradise.
p413
aa(lp414
VThank you.
