VOver the past 10 years,
p4
aVI've been researching the way people organize and visualize information.
p5
aVAnd I've noticed an interesting shift.
p6
aa(lp7
VFor a long period of time,
p8
aVwe believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us,
p9
aValso known as the great chain of being, or "Scala naturae" in Latin,
p10
aVa top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top,
p11
aVfollowed by angels, noblemen,
p12
aVcommon people, animals, and so on.
p13
aVThis idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology,
p14
aVwhich classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories,
p15
aVlike the ones you see behind me.
p16
aVBut over time, interestingly enough,
p17
aVthis concept adopted the branching schema of a tree
p18
aVin what became known as the Porphyrian tree,
p19
aValso considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe branching scheme of the tree was, in fact,
p22
aVsuch a powerful metaphor for conveying information
p23
aVthat it became, over time, an important communication tool
p24
aVto map a variety of systems of knowledge.
p25
aVWe can see trees being used to map morality,
p26
aVwith the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices,
p27
aVas you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe.
p28
aVWe can see trees being used to map consanguinity,
p29
aVthe various blood ties between people.
p30
aVWe can also see trees being used to map genealogy,
p31
aVperhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram.
p32
aVI think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees.
p33
aVMany of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way.
p34
aVWe can see trees even mapping systems of law,
p35
aVthe various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers.
p36
aVAnd finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor,
p37
aVwe can see trees being used to map all species known to man.
p38
aVAnd trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor
p39
aVbecause in many ways, they really embody this human desire
p40
aVfor order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.
p41
aa(lp42
VHowever, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges
p43
aVthat cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram.
p44
aVAnd a new metaphor is currently emerging,
p45
aVand it's currently replacing the tree
p46
aVin visualizing various systems of knowledge.
p47
aVIt's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us.
p48
aVAnd this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network.
p49
aVAnd we can see this shift from trees into networks
p50
aVin many domains of knowledge.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain.
p53
aVWhile before, we used to think of the brain
p54
aVas a modular, centralized organ,
p55
aVwhere a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors,
p56
aVthe more we know about the brain,
p57
aVthe more we think of it as a large music symphony,
p58
aVplayed by hundreds and thousands of instruments.
p59
aVThis is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project,
p60
aVwhere you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections.
p61
aVAnd this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex.
p62
aVWe can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.
p63
aa(lp64
VThese are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science,
p65
aVby Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.
p66
aVAnd Llull was actually the precursor,
p67
aVthe very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree,
p68
aVa metaphor we use every single day, when we say,
p69
aV"Biology is a branch of science,"
p70
aVwhen we say,
p71
aV"Genetics is a branch of science."
p72
aVBut perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me,
p73
aVwas created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.
p74
aVThis was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment,
p75
aVand this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents
p76
aVfor the encyclopedia.
p77
aVAnd it actually maps out all domains of knowledge
p78
aVas separate branches of a tree.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut knowledge is much more intricate than this.
p81
aVThese are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles \u2014
p82
aVrelated to history on the left, and mathematics on the right.
p83
aVAnd I think by looking at these maps
p84
aVand other ones that have been created of Wikipedia \u2014
p85
aVarguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man \u2014
p86
aVwe can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate
p87
aVand interdependent, just like a network.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe can also see this interesting shift
p90
aVin the way we map social ties between people.
p91
aVThis is the typical organization chart.
p92
aVI'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well,
p93
aVin your own corporations, or others.
p94
aVIt's a top-down structure
p95
aVthat normally starts with the CEO at the very top,
p96
aVand where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom.
p97
aVBut humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way,
p98
aVand sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.
p99
aa(lp100
VI think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot.
p101
aVThis is a fantastic map of online social collaboration
p102
aVbetween Perl developers.
p103
aVPerl is a famous programming language,
p104
aVand here, you can see how different programmers
p105
aVare actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project.
p106
aVAnd here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process \u2014
p107
aVthere's no leader in this organization,
p108
aVit's a network.
p109
aa(lp110
VWe can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism.
p111
aVOne of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays
p112
aVis that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells,
p113
aVwhere there's no leader leading the whole process.
p114
aVAnd here, you can actually see how visualization is being used.
p115
aVThe diagram that you see behind me
p116
aVshows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004.
p117
aVAnd what they did here is, they actually segmented the network
p118
aVinto three different years,
p119
aVrepresented by the vertical layers that you see behind me.
p120
aVAnd the blue lines tie together
p121
aVthe people that were present in that network year after year.
p122
aVSo even though there's no leader per se,
p123
aVthese people are probably the most influential ones in that organization,
p124
aVthe ones that know more about the past,
p125
aVand the future plans and goals of this particular cell.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe can also see this shift from trees into networks
p128
aVin the way we classify and organize species.
p129
aVThe image on the right is the only illustration
p130
aVthat Darwin included in "The Origin of Species,"
p131
aVwhich Darwin called the "Tree of Life."
p132
aVThere's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher,
p133
aVexpanding on the importance of this particular diagram.
p134
aVIt was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution.
p135
aVBut recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life
p136
aVis a dense network of bacteria,
p137
aVand these bacteria are actually tying together
p138
aVspecies that were completely separated before,
p139
aVto what scientists are now calling not the tree of life,
p140
aVbut the web of life, the network of life.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd finally, we can really see this shift, again,
p143
aVwhen we look at ecosystems around our planet.
p144
aVNo more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams
p145
aVwe have all learned at school.
p146
aVThis is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem.
p147
aVThis is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne,
p148
aVmapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish
p149
aVoff the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.
p150
aVAnd I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature
p151
aVof most ecosystems that abound on our planet.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut even though recent, this metaphor of the network,
p154
aVis really already adopting various shapes and forms,
p155
aVand it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy.
p156
aVIt's almost becoming the syntax of a new language.
p157
aVAnd this is one aspect that truly fascinates me.
p158
aVAnd these are actually 15 different typologies
p159
aVI've been collecting over time,
p160
aVand it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor.
p161
aVAnd here is an example.
p162
aVOn the very top band, you have radial convergence,
p163
aVa visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years.
p164
aVAt the top left, the very first project is a gene network,
p165
aVfollowed by a network of IP addresses \u2014 machines, servers \u2014
p166
aVfollowed by a network of Facebook friends.
p167
aVYou probably couldn't find more disparate topics,
p168
aVyet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model,
p169
aVto map the never-ending complexities of its own subject.
p170
aVAnd here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting,
p171
aVof this growing visual taxonomy of networks.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut networks are not just a scientific metaphor.
p174
aVAs designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems,
p175
aVthey are in many ways influencing traditional art fields,
p176
aVlike painting and sculpture,
p177
aVand influencing many different artists.
p178
aVAnd perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them \u2014
p179
aVthey're immensely gorgeous \u2014
p180
aVthey are really becoming a cultural meme,
p181
aVand driving a new art movement, which I've called "networkism."
p182
aVAnd we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways.
p183
aVThis is just one of many examples,
p184
aVwhere you can see this influence from science into art.
p185
aVThe example on your left side is IP-mapping,
p186
aVa computer-generated map of IP addresses; again \u2014 servers, machines.
p187
aVAnd on your right side,
p188
aVyou have "Transient Structures and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,
p189
aVusing oil and enamel on canvas.
p190
aVAnd here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy,
p191
aVsome gorgeous, intricate paintings.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination
p194
aVbetween science and art.
p195
aVOn your left side, you have "Operation Smile."
p196
aVIt is a computer-generated map of a social network.
p197
aVAnd on your right side, you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,
p198
aVusing only graphite on paper.
p199
aVEmma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement,
p200
aVand she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes,
p201
aVwhere you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions.
p204
aVThis is perhaps one of my favorite projects
p205
aVof this new movement.
p206
aVAnd I think the title really says it all \u2014 it's called:
p207
aV"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,
p208
aVLike Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web."
p209
aVAnd I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful.
p210
aVIt was created by Tomás Saraceno,
p211
aVand he occupies these large spaces,
p212
aVcreates these massive installations using only elastic ropes.
p213
aVAs you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes,
p214
aVthe entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd here's yet another example
p217
aVof networkism taken to a whole different level.
p218
aVThis was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota
p219
aVin a piece called "In Silence."
p220
aVAnd Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network,
p221
aVthis dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread,
p222
aVsometimes including objects, as you can see here,
p223
aVsometimes even including people, in many of her installations.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut networks are also not just a new trend,
p226
aVand it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such.
p227
aVNetworks really embody notions of decentralization,
p228
aVof interconnectedness, of interdependence.
p229
aVAnd this new way of thinking is critical
p230
aVfor us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays,
p231
aVfrom decoding the human brain,
p232
aVto understanding the vast universe out there.
p233
aVOn your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse \u2014
p234
aVvery similar to our own at this particular scale.
p235
aVAnd on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation.
p236
aVIt was the largest and most realistic simulation
p237
aVof the growth of cosmic structure.
p238
aVIt was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies
p239
aVin approximately 25 terabytes of output.
p240
aVAnd coincidentally or not,
p241
aVI just find this particular comparison
p242
aVbetween the smallest scale of knowledge \u2014 the brain \u2014
p243
aVand the largest scale of knowledge \u2014 the universe itself \u2014
p244
aVto be really quite striking and fascinating.
p245
aVBecause as Bruce Mau once said,
p246
aV"When everything is connected to everything else,
p247
aVfor better or for worse, everything matters."
p248
aa(lp249
VThank you so much.
