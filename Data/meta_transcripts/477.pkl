VThe "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called
p4
aVto a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
p5
aVIt's only a couple dozen square miles.
p6
aVIt's in the Rockies.
p7
aVAnd the job in question was sheep rancher.
p8
aa(lp9
VMy role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it \u2014 it's pretty simple.
p10
aVI'm an apprentice,
p11
aVand I work with the people who do the jobs in question.
p12
aVAnd my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up,
p13
aVand give an honest account of what it's like to be these people
p14
aVfor one day in their life.
p15
aVThe job in question: herding sheep.
p16
aVGreat.
p17
aa(lp18
VWe go to Craig and we check into a hotel,
p19
aVand I realize the next day
p20
aVthat castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
p21
aVNormally, I never do any research at all.
p22
aVBut this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,
p23
aVand we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do.
p24
aVAnd we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.
p25
aVSo I call the Humane Society and I say,
p26
aV"Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."
p29
aVThey use a band, basically, a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.
p30
aVThis one was actually around the playing cards
p31
aVI got yesterday \u2014
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aVBut it had a certain familiarity to it.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.
p39
aVAnd then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.
p40
aVBlood flow is slowly retarded;
p41
aVa week later the parts in question fall off.
p42
aa(lp43
V"Great \u2014 got it."
p44
aVOK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.
p45
aVThey confirm it.
p46
aVI also call PETA just for fun,
p47
aVand they don't like it, but they confirm it.
p48
aVOK, that's basically how you do it.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo the next day I go out.
p51
aVAnd I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs
p52
aVand we take them to a pen that we built,
p53
aVand we go about the business of animal husbandry.
p54
aa(lp55
VMelanie is the wife of Albert.
p56
aVAlbert is the shepherd in question.
p57
aVMelanie picks up the lamb, one hand on both legs on the right,
p58
aVlikewise on the left.
p59
aVLamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
p60
aVAlright. Great.
p61
aVAlbert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.
p62
aVI always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
p63
aVBeing an apprentice, you know, you do that.
p64
aVAlbert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band,
p65
aVbut what comes out instead is a knife.
p66
aVAnd I'm like, "Hmm, that's not rubber at all," you know?
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun
p71
aVthat was just coming over the Rockies, it was very \u2014
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VIt was ... it was impressive.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn the space of about two seconds,
p78
aVAlbert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail,
p79
aVright next to the butt of the lamb,
p80
aVand very quickly, the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.
p81
aVA second later, with a big thumb and a well-calloused forefinger,
p82
aVhe had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
p83
aVAnd he pulled it toward him, like so,
p84
aVand he took the knife and he put it on the tip.
p85
aV"Now, you think you know what's coming, Michael,
p86
aVYou don't, OK?"
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VHe snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,
p91
aVand then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,
p92
aVand then his head dips down, obscuring my view.
p93
aVBut what I hear is a slurping sound,
p94
aVand a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall,
p95
aVand I am not even kidding.
p96
aa(lp97
VCan we roll the video?
p98
aVNo, I'm kidding, we don't \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VI thought it best to talk in pictures.
p103
aa(lp104
VI do something now I've never, ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.
p105
aVI say, "Time out. Stop."
p106
aVYou guys know the show, we use take one; we don't do take two.
p107
aVThere's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.
p108
aVWe don't fool around, we don't rehearse \u2014
p109
aVwe shoot what we get!
p110
aa(lp111
VI said, "Stop. This is nuts."
p112
aVI mean \u2014
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
V"This is crazy.
p117
aVWe can't do this."
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd Albert's like, "What?"
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd I'm like, "I don't know what just happened,
p122
aVbut there are testicles in this bucket,
p123
aVand that's not how we do it."
p124
aa(lp125
VHe said "Well, that's how we do it."
p126
aa(lp127
VI said, "Why would you do it this way?"
p128
aVAnd before I even let him explain,
p129
aVI said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd he says, "Like the Humane Society?"
p132
aa(lp133
VI said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.
p134
aVLet's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed.
p135
aVWe're on in five continents, dude!
p136
aVWe're on twice a day on the Discovery \u2014 we can't do this."
p137
aa(lp138
VHe says, "OK."
p139
aVHe goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
p140
aVMelanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,
p141
aVband goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.
p142
aVLamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,
p143
aVgets up, shakes a little,
p144
aVtakes another couple steps, falls down.
p145
aVI'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.
p146
aVGets up, walks to the corner.
p147
aVIt's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?
p150
aVWhen does he get up?"
p151
aa(lp152
VHe's like, "A day?"
p153
aa(lp154
VI said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"
p155
aa(lp156
V"A week."
p157
aa(lp158
VMeanwhile, the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on
p159
aVis, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.
p160
aVHe's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.
p161
aVAnd I was just so blown away at how completely wrong I was,
p162
aVin that second.
p163
aVAnd I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd I was especially reminded
p168
aVof what a ridiculously short straw I had that day,
p169
aVbecause now I had to do what Albert had just done,
p170
aVand there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen.
p171
aVAnd suddenly, this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,
p172
aVand I'm like \u2014
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VMelanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up.
p177
aVAlbert hands me the knife.
p178
aVI go in, tail comes off.
p179
aVI go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.
p180
aVAlbert instructs, "Push it way up there."
p181
aVI do.
p182
aV"Push it further."
p183
aVI do.
p184
aa(lp185
VThe testicles emerge. They look like thumbs, coming right at you.
p186
aVAnd he says, "Bite 'em.
p187
aVJust bite 'em off."
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd I heard him, I heard all the words \u2014
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VLike, how did I get here?
p196
aVHow did \u2014 I mean \u2014
p197
aVhow did I get here?
p198
aa(lp199
VIt's just \u2014 it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on its own,
p200
aVand suddenly, I'm standing there in the Rockies,
p201
aVand all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.
p202
aVYou know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment
p203
aVwhen the hero comes face to face with his true identity.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd I'm like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?
p208
aVI don't like what I'm thinking right now."
p209
aVAnd I can't get this thought out of my head,
p210
aVand I can't get that vision out of my sight,
p211
aVso I did what I had to do.
p212
aVI went in and I took them.
p213
aVI took them like this,
p214
aVand I yanked my head back.
p215
aVAnd I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd now I can't get \u2014 I can't shake the metaphor.
p220
aa(lp221
VI'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle, and I'm thinking \u2014
p222
aVout of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head, that I hadn't heard
p223
aVsince my classics professor in college drilled them there.
p224
aVAnd they are "anagnorisis" and "peripeteia."
p225
aVAnagnorisis and peripeteia.
p226
aVAnagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
p227
aVLiterally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.
p228
aVIt's what our network does; it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.
p229
aVAnd I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
p230
aVGreat.
p231
aVThe other word, peripeteia,
p232
aVthat's the moment in the great tragedies \u2014
p233
aVEuripides and Sophocles.
p234
aVThat's the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes
p235
aVthat hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with
p236
aVis his mother.
p237
aVThat's peripety, or peripeteia.
p238
aVAnd this metaphor in my head \u2014
p239
aVI've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VI've got to tell you, it's such a great device, though.
p244
aVWhen you start to look for peripeteia,
p245
aVyou find it everywhere.
p246
aVI mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?
p247
aVSpends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,
p248
aVand then \u2014 boom! \u2014 "Oh, I'm dead."
p249
aVPeripeteia. You know?
p250
aVIt's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
p251
aVNeo in "The Matrix," you know?
p252
aV"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.
p253
aVThat's weird."
p254
aa(lp255
VThese discoveries that lead to sudden realizations.
p256
aVAnd I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs,
p257
aVI have them all the time, but that one \u2014
p258
aVthat one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.
p259
aVAnd, as I stood there,
p260
aVlooking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled \u2014
p261
aVbut it looked OK;
p262
aVlooking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,
p263
aVand I just was struck by \u2014
p264
aVif I'm wrong about that,
p265
aVand if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,
p266
aVwhat other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?
p267
aa(lp268
VBecause, look \u2014 I'm not a social anthropologist,
p269
aVbut I have a friend who is.
p270
aVAnd I talk to him.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd he says, "Hey Mike, look.
p275
aVI don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,
p276
aVbut do you realize you've shot in every state?
p277
aVYou've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing,
p278
aVyou've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.
p279
aVYou've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys
p280
aVthat our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"
p281
aa(lp282
VI can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,
p283
aVdribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.
p284
aVI mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.
p285
aV"And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,
p286
aVit might be time to think about it.
p287
aVBecause, dude, you know, four years."
p288
aVSo, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin,
p289
aVthoughts are bouncing around.
p290
aVAnd, after that shoot, "Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,
p291
aVin terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd now, when I talk about the show,
p294
aVI no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
p295
aVI do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things
p296
aVI got wrong;
p297
aVsome of the other notions of work
p298
aVthat I've just been assuming are sacrosanct,
p299
aVand they're not.
p300
aVPeople with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
p301
aVAs a group, they're the happiest people I know.
p302
aVAnd I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"
p303
aVand all that happy-worker crap.
p304
aVI'm just telling you that these are balanced people
p305
aVwho do unthinkable work.
p306
aVRoadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work, I swear to God \u2014
p307
aVI did it with them.
p308
aVThey've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
p309
aVAnd I see it over and over and over again.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo I started to wonder what would happen
p312
aVif we challenged some of these sacred cows?
p313
aVFollow your passion \u2014
p314
aVwe've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
p315
aVFollow your passion \u2014 what could possibly be wrong with that?
p316
aVIt's probably the worst advice I ever got.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VFollow your dreams and go broke, right?
p321
aVI mean, that's all I heard growing up.
p322
aVI didn't know what to do with my life,
p323
aVbut I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.
p324
aa(lp325
VI can give you 30 examples right now.
p326
aVBob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas
p327
aVwho collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos
p328
aVand feeds them to his swine.
p329
aVWhy?
p330
aVBecause there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat,
p331
aVhis pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he's one rich pig farmer.
p332
aVHe's good for the environment,
p333
aVhe spends his days doing this incredible service,
p334
aVand he smells like hell, but God bless him.
p335
aVHe's making a great living.
p336
aVYou ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"
p337
aVand he'd laugh at you.
p338
aVThe guy's worth \u2014 he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm
p339
aVand turned it down, outside of Vegas.
p340
aVHe didn't follow his passion.
p341
aVHe stepped back and he watched where everybody was going,
p342
aVand he went the other way.
p343
aVAnd I hear that story over and over.
p344
aa(lp345
VMatt Freund, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,
p346
aVwho woke up one day and realized
p347
aVthe crap from his cows was worth more than their milk,
p348
aVif he could use it to make these biodegradable flowerpots.
p349
aVNow he's selling them to Walmart, right?
p350
aVFollow his passion? The guy's \u2014 come on.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo I started to look at passion,
p353
aVI started to look at efficiency vs. effectiveness.
p354
aVAs Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.
p355
aVI started to look at teamwork and determination.
p356
aVAnd basically, all those platitudes they call "successories"
p357
aVthat hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now,
p358
aVthat stuff \u2014 it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
p359
aa(lp360
VSafety. Safety first is ...
p361
aVGoing back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:
p362
aVWhat if OSHA got it wrong?
p363
aVI mean \u2014 this is heresy, what I'm about to say \u2014
p364
aVbut what if it's really safety third?
p365
aVRight?
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VNo, I mean, really.
p370
aVWhat I mean to say is:
p371
aVI value my safety on these crazy jobs
p372
aVas much as the people that I'm working with,
p373
aVbut the ones who really get it done \u2014
p374
aVthey're not out there talking about safety first.
p375
aVThey know that other things come first \u2014
p376
aVthe business of doing the work comes first,
p377
aVthe business of getting it done.
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea,
p380
aVI was on a crab boat with the "Deadliest Catch" guys \u2014
p381
aVwhich I also work on in the first season.
p382
aVWe were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:
p383
aV50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?
p384
aVMost hazardous environment I'd ever seen,
p385
aVand I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.
p386
aVSo I'm 40 feet off the deck,
p387
aVwhich is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know,
p388
aVand it's doing this in the ocean.
p389
aVUnspeakably dangerous.
p390
aa(lp391
VI scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse
p392
aVand I say, with some level of incredulity,
p393
aV"Captain \u2014 OSHA?"
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd he says, "OSHA? Ocean."
p396
aVAnd he points out there.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VBut in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the Lower 48.
p401
aVIt can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
p402
aVBut he looked at me and said, "Son," \u2014
p403
aVhe's my age, by the way, he calls me "son," I love that \u2014
p404
aVhe says, "Son, I'm the captain of a crab boat.
p405
aVMy responsibility is not to get you home alive.
p406
aVMy responsibility is to get you home rich."
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VYou want to get home alive, that's on you."
p411
aVAnd for the rest of that day \u2014 safety first.
p412
aa(lp413
VI mean, I was like \u2014
p414
aVSo, the idea that we create this sense of complacency
p415
aVwhen all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility
p416
aVas though it's our own, and vice versa.
p417
aVAnyhow, a whole lot of things.
p418
aVI could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made
p419
aVand the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
p420
aVBut what it all comes down to is this:
p421
aVI've formed a theory,
p422
aVand I'm going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
p423
aa(lp424
VIt goes like this:
p425
aVwe've declared war on work, as a society \u2014 all of us.
p426
aVIt's a civil war.
p427
aVIt's a cold war, really.
p428
aVWe didn't set out to do it
p429
aVand we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,
p430
aVbut we've done it.
p431
aVAnd we've waged this war on at least four fronts,
p432
aVcertainly in Hollywood.
p433
aVThe way we portray working people on TV \u2014
p434
aVit's laughable.
p435
aVIf there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds
p436
aVand he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.
p437
aVYou see him all the time.
p438
aVThat's what plumbers look like, right?
p439
aVWe turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.
p440
aVThat's what TV does.
p441
aVWe try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,
p442
aVwhich is why I do the work and I don't cheat.
p443
aa(lp444
VBut, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.
p445
aVSo many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message \u2014
p446
aVwhat's really being said?
p447
aV"Your life would be better if you could work a little less,
p448
aVdidn't have to work so hard, got home a little earlier,
p449
aVcould retire a little faster, punch out a little sooner."
p450
aVIt's all in there, over and over, again and again.
p451
aa(lp452
VWashington?
p453
aVI can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place
p454
aVthat affect the bottom-line reality of the available jobs,
p455
aVbecause I don't really know; I just know that that's a front in this war.
p456
aa(lp457
VAnd right here, guys \u2014 Silicon Valley.
p458
aVI mean \u2014 how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
p459
aVHow many people have their BlackBerry?
p460
aVWe're plugged in; we're connected.
p461
aVI would never suggest for a second
p462
aVthat something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
p463
aVGood grief, not to this crowd.
p464
aa(lp465
V(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VBut I would suggest
p468
aVthat innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
p469
aVAnd nobody celebrates imitation
p470
aVthe way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.
p471
aVYour iPhone without those people making the same interface,
p472
aVthe same circuitry, the same board, over and over \u2014
p473
aVall of that \u2014 that's what makes it equally as possible
p474
aVas the genius that goes inside of it.
p475
aa(lp476
VSo, we've got this new toolbox. You know?
p477
aVOur tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
p478
aVThey look like the stuff we walk around with.
p479
aVAnd so the collective effect of all of that
p480
aVhas been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
p481
aVAnd I realized, probably too late in this game \u2014
p482
aVI hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things \u2014
p483
aVbut we're going to do as many as we can.
p484
aVAnd to me, the most important thing to know
p485
aVand to really come face to face with,
p486
aVis that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,
p487
aVnot just the testicles on my chin.
p488
aVI got a lot wrong.
p489
aa(lp490
VSo, we're thinking \u2014 by "we," I mean me \u2014
p491
aa(lp492
V(Laughter)
p493
aa(lp494
Vthat the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work \u2014
p495
aVmanual labor, skilled labor.
p496
aVSomebody needs to be out there, talking about the forgotten benefits.
p497
aVI'm talking about grandfather stuff,
p498
aVthe stuff a lot us probably grew up with
p499
aVbut we've kind of \u2014 you know, kind of lost a little.
p500
aa(lp501
VBarack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
p502
aVThe infrastructure is a huge deal.
p503
aVThis war on work that I suppose exists, has casualties like any other war.
p504
aVThe infrastructure is the first one,
p505
aVdeclining trade school enrollments are the second one.
p506
aVEvery single year, fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,
p507
aVfewer welders, fewer pipe fitters, fewer steam fitters.
p508
aVThe infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating
p509
aVare those guys \u2014 the ones that have been in decline, over and over.
p510
aVMeanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars, at a minimum,
p511
aVaccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers,
p512
aVthat we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,
p513
aVwhich is currently rated at a D minus.
p514
aa(lp515
VSo, if I were running for anything \u2014 and I'm not \u2014
p516
aVI would simply say that the jobs we hope to make
p517
aVand the jobs we hope to create
p518
aVaren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
p519
aVAnd I know the point of this conference
p520
aVis to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,
p521
aVbut I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.
p522
aVThey're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,
p523
aVlike risk and responsibility, like peripeteia and anagnorisis,
p524
aVlike that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,
p525
aVand like my time that's gone.
p526
aa(lp527
VIt's been great talking to you.
p528
aVAnd get back to work, will you?
