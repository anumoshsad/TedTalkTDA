aa(lp7
VLet's start the story 120 years ago,
p8
aVwhen American factories began to electrify their operations,
p9
aVigniting the Second Industrial Revolution.
p10
aVThe amazing thing is
p11
aVthat productivity did not increase in those factories
p12
aVfor 30 years. Thirty years.
p13
aVThat's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.
p14
aVYou see, the first wave of managers
p15
aVsimply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,
p16
aVbut they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage
p17
aVof electricity's flexibility.
p18
aVIt fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,
p19
aVand then productivity soared,
p20
aVoften doubling or even tripling in those factories.
p21
aa(lp22
VElectricity is an example of a general purpose technology,
p23
aVlike the steam engine before it.
p24
aVGeneral purpose technologies drive most economic growth,
p25
aVbecause they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,
p26
aVlike lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.
p27
aVIs there a general purpose technology of our era?
p28
aVSure. It's the computer.
p29
aVBut technology alone is not enough.
p30
aVTechnology is not destiny.
p31
aVWe shape our destiny,
p32
aVand just as the earlier generations of managers
p33
aVneeded to redesign their factories,
p34
aVwe're going to need to reinvent our organizations
p35
aVand even our whole economic system.
p36
aVWe're not doing as well at that job as we should be.
p37
aVAs we'll see in a moment,
p38
aVproductivity is actually doing all right,
p39
aVbut it has become decoupled from jobs,
p40
aVand the income of the typical worker is stagnating.
p41
aVThese troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed
p42
aVas the end of innovation,
p43
aVbut they are actually the growing pains
p44
aVof what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.
p45
aa(lp46
VLet's look at some data.
p47
aVSo here's GDP per person in America.
p48
aVThere's some bumps along the way, but the big story
p49
aVis you could practically fit a ruler to it.
p50
aVThis is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth
p51
aVis actually an acceleration in real terms.
p52
aVAnd here's productivity.
p53
aVYou can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,
p54
aVbut it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,
p55
aVwhen factories were learning how to electrify their operations.
p56
aVAfter a lag, productivity accelerated again.
p57
aVSo maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,
p58
aVbut sometimes it rhymes."
p59
aVToday, productivity is at an all-time high,
p60
aVand despite the Great Recession,
p61
aVit grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,
p62
aVthe roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
p63
aVIt's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.
p64
aVAnd that's just the United States.
p65
aVThe global news is even better.
p66
aVWorldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate
p67
aVin the past decade than ever in history.
p68
aa(lp69
VIf anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,
p70
aVbecause the new machine age
p71
aVis more about knowledge creation
p72
aVthan just physical production.
p73
aVIt's mind not matter, brain not brawn,
p74
aVideas not things.
p75
aVThat creates a problem for standard metrics,
p76
aVbecause we're getting more and more stuff for free,
p77
aVlike Wikipedia, Google, Skype,
p78
aVand if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.
p79
aVNow getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?
p80
aVSure, of course it is.
p81
aVBut that's not how economists measure GDP.
p82
aVZero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.
p83
aVAccording to the numbers, the music industry
p84
aVis half the size that it was 10 years ago,
p85
aVbut I'm listening to more and better music than ever.
p86
aVYou know, I bet you are too.
p87
aVIn total, my research estimates
p88
aVthat the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year
p89
aVin free goods and services on the Internet.
p90
aVNow let's look to the future.
p91
aVThere are some super smart people
p92
aVwho are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,
p93
aVbut to understand the future of growth,
p94
aVwe need to make predictions
p95
aVabout the underlying drivers of growth.
p96
aVI'm optimistic, because the new machine age
p97
aVis digital, exponential and combinatorial.
p98
aa(lp99
VWhen goods are digital, they can be replicated
p100
aVwith perfect quality at nearly zero cost,
p101
aVand they can be delivered almost instantaneously.
p102
aVWelcome to the economics of abundance.
p103
aVBut there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.
p104
aVMeasurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.
p105
aVIn the age of big data,
p106
aVwe can measure the world in ways we never could before.
p107
aa(lp108
VSecondly, the new machine age is exponential.
p109
aVComputers get better faster than anything else ever.
p110
aVA child's Playstation today is more powerful
p111
aVthan a military supercomputer from 1996.
p112
aVBut our brains are wired for a linear world.
p113
aVAs a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.
p114
aVI used to teach my students that there are some things,
p115
aVyou know, computers just aren't good at,
p116
aVlike driving a car through traffic.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVThat's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen
p119
aVbecause we just rode down Route 101
p120
aVin, yes, a driverless car.
p121
aa(lp122
VThirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.
p123
aVThe stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,
p124
aVlike low-hanging fruit,
p125
aVbut the reality is that each innovation
p126
aVcreates building blocks for even more innovations.
p127
aVHere's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,
p128
aVan undergraduate student of mine
p129
aVbuilt an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.
p130
aVHe was able to do that so easily
p131
aVbecause he built it on top of Facebook,
p132
aVand Facebook was built on top of the web,
p133
aVand that was built on top of the Internet,
p134
aVand so on and so forth.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial
p137
aVwould each be game-changers.
p138
aVPut them together, and we're seeing a wave
p139
aVof astonishing breakthroughs,
p140
aVlike robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah
p141
aVor leap tall buildings in a single bound.
p142
aVYou know, robots are even revolutionizing
p143
aVcat transportation.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VBut perhaps the most important invention,
p148
aVthe most important invention is machine learning.
p149
aVConsider one project: IBM's Watson.
p150
aVThese little dots here,
p151
aVthose are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."
p152
aVAt first, Watson wasn't very good,
p153
aVbut it improved at a rate faster than any human could,
p154
aVand shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart
p155
aVto my class at MIT,
p156
aVWatson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.
p157
aVAt age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.
p158
aVRecently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.
p159
aVThe next day, it started answering questions with profanities.
p160
aVDamn. (Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VBut you know, Watson is growing up fast.
p163
aVIt's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.
p164
aVIt's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,
p165
aVand getting some of them.
p166
aVIsn't it ironic that at the very moment
p167
aVwe are building intelligent machines,
p168
aVperhaps the most important invention in human history,
p169
aVsome people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?
p170
aVLike the first two industrial revolutions,
p171
aVthe full implications of the new machine age
p172
aVare going to take at least a century to fully play out,
p173
aVbut they are staggering.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo does that mean we have nothing to worry about?
p176
aVNo. Technology is not destiny.
p177
aVProductivity is at an all time high,
p178
aVbut fewer people now have jobs.
p179
aVWe have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,
p180
aVbut for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.
p181
aVThis is the great decoupling
p182
aVof productivity from employment,
p183
aVof wealth from work.
p184
aVYou know, it's not surprising that millions of people
p185
aVhave become disillusioned by the great decoupling,
p186
aVbut like too many others,
p187
aVthey misunderstand its basic causes.
p188
aVTechnology is racing ahead,
p189
aVbut it's leaving more and more people behind.
p190
aVToday, we can take a routine job,
p191
aVcodify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,
p192
aVand then replicate it a million times.
p193
aa(lp194
VYou know, I recently overheard a conversation
p195
aVthat epitomizes these new economics.
p196
aVThis guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&R Block anymore.
p197
aVTurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,
p198
aVbut it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."
p199
aVHow can a skilled worker
p200
aVcompete with a $39 piece of software?
p201
aVShe can't.
p202
aVToday, millions of Americans do have faster,
p203
aVcheaper, more accurate tax preparation,
p204
aVand the founders of Intuit
p205
aVhave done very well for themselves.
p206
aVBut 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.
p207
aVThat is a microcosm of what's happening,
p208
aVnot just in software and services, but in media and music,
p209
aVin finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade \u2014
p210
aVin short, in every industry.
p211
aVPeople are racing against the machine,
p212
aVand many of them are losing that race.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhat can we do to create shared prosperity?
p215
aVThe answer is not to try to slow down technology.
p216
aVInstead of racing against the machine,
p217
aVwe need to learn to race with the machine.
p218
aVThat is our grand challenge.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe new machine age
p221
aVcan be dated to a day 15 years ago
p222
aVwhen Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,
p223
aVplayed Deep Blue, a supercomputer.
p224
aVThe machine won that day,
p225
aVand today, a chess program running on a cell phone
p226
aVcan beat a human grandmaster.
p227
aVIt got so bad that, when he was asked
p228
aVwhat strategy he would use against a computer,
p229
aVJan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,
p230
aV"I'd bring a hammer."
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VBut today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.
p235
aVNeither is a human,
p236
aVbecause Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
p237
aVwhere teams of humans and computers
p238
aVcould work together,
p239
aVand the winning team had no grandmaster,
p240
aVand it had no supercomputer.
p241
aVWhat they had was better teamwork,
p242
aVand they showed that a team of humans and computers,
p243
aVworking together, could beat any computer
p244
aVor any human working alone.
p245
aVRacing with the machine
p246
aVbeats racing against the machine.
p247
aVTechnology is not destiny.
p248
aVWe shape our destiny.
