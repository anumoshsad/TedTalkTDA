VAt every stage of our lives
p4
aVwe make decisions that will profoundly influence
p5
aVthe lives of the people we're going to become,
p6
aVand then when we become those people,
p7
aVwe're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.
p8
aVSo young people pay good money
p9
aVto get tattoos removed that teenagers
p10
aVpaid good money to get.
p11
aVMiddle-aged people rushed to divorce people
p12
aVwho young adults rushed to marry.
p13
aVOlder adults work hard to lose
p14
aVwhat middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.
p15
aVOn and on and on.
p16
aVThe question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is,
p17
aVwhy do we make decisions
p18
aVthat our future selves so often regret?
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, I think one of the reasons \u2014
p21
aVI'll try to convince you today \u2014
p22
aVis that we have a fundamental misconception
p23
aVabout the power of time.
p24
aVEvery one of you knows that the rate of change
p25
aVslows over the human lifespan,
p26
aVthat your children seem to change by the minute
p27
aVbut your parents seem to change by the year.
p28
aVBut what is the name of this magical point in life
p29
aVwhere change suddenly goes
p30
aVfrom a gallop to a crawl?
p31
aVIs it teenage years? Is it middle age?
p32
aVIs it old age? The answer, it turns out,
p33
aVfor most people, is now,
p34
aVwherever now happens to be.
p35
aVWhat I want to convince you today
p36
aVis that all of us are walking around with an illusion,
p37
aVan illusion that history, our personal history,
p38
aVhas just come to an end,
p39
aVthat we have just recently become
p40
aVthe people that we were always meant to be
p41
aVand will be for the rest of our lives.
p42
aa(lp43
VLet me give you some data to back up that claim.
p44
aVSo here's a study of change in people's
p45
aVpersonal values over time.
p46
aVHere's three values.
p47
aVEverybody here holds all of them,
p48
aVbut you probably know that as you grow,
p49
aVas you age, the balance of these values shifts.
p50
aVSo how does it do so?
p51
aVWell, we asked thousands of people.
p52
aVWe asked half of them to predict for us
p53
aVhow much their values would change in the next 10 years,
p54
aVand the others to tell us
p55
aVhow much their values had changed in the last 10 years.
p56
aVAnd this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis,
p57
aVbecause it allowed us to compare the predictions
p58
aVof people, say, 18 years old,
p59
aVto the reports of people who were 28,
p60
aVand to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.
p61
aa(lp62
VHere's what we found.
p63
aVFirst of all, you are right,
p64
aVchange does slow down as we age,
p65
aVbut second, you're wrong,
p66
aVbecause it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.
p67
aVAt every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,
p68
aVpeople vastly underestimated how much change
p69
aVthey would experience over the next 10 years.
p70
aVWe call this the "end of history" illusion.
p71
aVTo give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,
p72
aVyou can connect these two lines,
p73
aVand what you see here is that 18-year-olds
p74
aVanticipate changing only as much
p75
aVas 50-year-olds actually do.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.
p78
aVFor example, personality.
p79
aVMany of you know that psychologists now claim
p80
aVthat there are five fundamental dimensions of personality:
p81
aVneuroticism, openness to experience,
p82
aVagreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.
p83
aVAgain, we asked people how much they expected
p84
aVto change over the next 10 years,
p85
aVand also how much they had changed over the last 10 years,
p86
aVand what we found,
p87
aVwell, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over,
p88
aVbecause once again the rate of change
p89
aVdoes slow as we age,
p90
aVbut at every age, people underestimate
p91
aVhow much their personalities will change
p92
aVin the next decade.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd it isn't just ephemeral things
p95
aVlike values and personality.
p96
aVYou can ask people about their likes and dislikes,
p97
aVtheir basic preferences.
p98
aVFor example, name your best friend,
p99
aVyour favorite kind of vacation,
p100
aVwhat's your favorite hobby,
p101
aVwhat's your favorite kind of music.
p102
aVPeople can name these things.
p103
aVWe ask half of them to tell us,
p104
aV"Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?"
p105
aVand half of them to tell us,
p106
aV"Did that change over the last 10 years?"
p107
aVAnd what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,
p108
aVand here it is again:
p109
aVpeople predict that the friend they have now
p110
aVis the friend they'll have in 10 years,
p111
aVthe vacation they most enjoy now is the one
p112
aVthey'll enjoy in 10 years,
p113
aVand yet, people who are 10 years older all say,
p114
aV"Eh, you know, that's really changed."
p115
aa(lp116
VDoes any of this matter?
p117
aVIs this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences?
p118
aVNo, it matters quite a bit, and I'll give you an example of why.
p119
aVIt bedevils our decision-making in important ways.
p120
aVBring to mind right now for yourself
p121
aVyour favorite musician today
p122
aVand your favorite musician 10 years ago.
p123
aVI put mine up on the screen to help you along.
p124
aVNow we asked people
p125
aVto predict for us, to tell us
p126
aVhow much money they would pay right now
p127
aVto see their current favorite musician
p128
aVperform in concert 10 years from now,
p129
aVand on average, people said they would pay
p130
aV129 dollars for that ticket.
p131
aVAnd yet, when we asked them how much they would pay
p132
aVto see the person who was their favorite
p133
aV10 years ago perform today,
p134
aVthey say only 80 dollars.
p135
aVNow, in a perfectly rational world,
p136
aVthese should be the same number,
p137
aVbut we overpay for the opportunity
p138
aVto indulge our current preferences
p139
aVbecause we overestimate their stability.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhy does this happen? We're not entirely sure,
p142
aVbut it probably has to do
p143
aVwith the ease of remembering
p144
aVversus the difficulty of imagining.
p145
aVMost of us can remember who we were 10 years ago,
p146
aVbut we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,
p147
aVand then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine,
p148
aVit's not likely to happen.
p149
aVSorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"
p150
aVthey're usually talking about their own lack of imagination,
p151
aVand not about the unlikelihood
p152
aVof the event that they're describing.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
p155
aVIt transforms our preferences.
p156
aVIt reshapes our values.
p157
aVIt alters our personalities.
p158
aVWe seem to appreciate this fact,
p159
aVbut only in retrospect.
p160
aVOnly when we look backwards do we realize
p161
aVhow much change happens in a decade.
p162
aVIt's as if, for most of us,
p163
aVthe present is a magic time.
p164
aVIt's a watershed on the timeline.
p165
aVIt's the moment at which we finally
p166
aVbecome ourselves.
p167
aVHuman beings are works in progress
p168
aVthat mistakenly think they're finished.
p169
aVThe person you are right now
p170
aVis as transient, as fleeting and as temporary
p171
aVas all the people you've ever been.
p172
aVThe one constant in our life is change.
