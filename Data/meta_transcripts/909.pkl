VThank you very much.
p4
aVPlease excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVWell, the topic I'm going to discuss
p7
aVis one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar
p8
aVbecause it's very old.
p9
aVRoughness is part of human life
p10
aVforever and forever,
p11
aVand ancient authors have written about it.
p12
aVIt was very much uncontrollable,
p13
aVand in a certain sense,
p14
aVit seemed to be the extreme of complexity,
p15
aVjust a mess, a mess and a mess.
p16
aVThere are many different kinds of mess.
p17
aVNow, in fact,
p18
aVby a complete fluke,
p19
aVI got involved many years ago
p20
aVin a study of this form of complexity,
p21
aVand to my utter amazement,
p22
aVI found traces \u2014
p23
aVvery strong traces, I must say \u2014
p24
aVof order in that roughness.
p25
aVAnd so today, I would like to present to you
p26
aVa few examples
p27
aVof what this represents.
p28
aVI prefer the word roughness
p29
aVto the word irregularity
p30
aVbecause irregularity \u2014
p31
aVto someone who had Latin
p32
aVin my long-past youth \u2014
p33
aVmeans the contrary of regularity.
p34
aVBut it is not so.
p35
aVRegularity is the contrary of roughness
p36
aVbecause the basic aspect of the world
p37
aVis very rough.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo let me show you a few objects.
p40
aVSome of them are artificial.
p41
aVOthers of them are very real, in a certain sense.
p42
aVNow this is the real. It's a cauliflower.
p43
aVNow why do I show a cauliflower,
p44
aVa very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
p45
aVBecause old and ancient as it may be,
p46
aVit's very complicated and it's very simple,
p47
aVboth at the same time.
p48
aVIf you try to weigh it \u2014 of course it's very easy to weigh it,
p49
aVand when you eat it, the weight matters \u2014
p50
aVbut suppose you try to
p51
aVmeasure its surface.
p52
aVWell, it's very interesting.
p53
aVIf you cut, with a sharp knife,
p54
aVone of the florets of a cauliflower
p55
aVand look at it separately,
p56
aVyou think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.
p57
aVAnd then you cut again,
p58
aVagain, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,
p59
aVand you still get small cauliflowers.
p60
aVSo the experience of humanity
p61
aVhas always been that there are some shapes
p62
aVwhich have this peculiar property,
p63
aVthat each part is like the whole,
p64
aVbut smaller.
p65
aVNow, what did humanity do with that?
p66
aVVery, very little.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSo what I did actually is to
p70
aVstudy this problem,
p71
aVand I found something quite surprising.
p72
aVThat one can measure roughness
p73
aVby a number, a number,
p74
aV2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.
p75
aVOne day, a friend of mine,
p76
aVto bug me,
p77
aVbrought a picture and said,
p78
aV"What is the roughness of this curve?"
p79
aVI said, "Well, just short of 1.5."
p80
aVIt was 1.48.
p81
aVNow, it didn't take me any time.
p82
aVI've been looking at these things for so long.
p83
aVSo these numbers are the numbers
p84
aVwhich denote the roughness of these surfaces.
p85
aVI hasten to say that these surfaces
p86
aVare completely artificial.
p87
aVThey were done on a computer,
p88
aVand the only input is a number,
p89
aVand that number is roughness.
p90
aVSo on the left,
p91
aVI took the roughness copied from many landscapes.
p92
aVTo the right, I took a higher roughness.
p93
aVSo the eye, after a while,
p94
aVcan distinguish these two very well.
p95
aa(lp96
VHumanity had to learn about measuring roughness.
p97
aVThis is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.
p98
aVVery few things are very smooth.
p99
aVSo then if you try to ask questions:
p100
aV"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"
p101
aVWell, you measure and measure and measure.
p102
aVEach time you're closer, it gets bigger,
p103
aVdown to very, very small distances.
p104
aVWhat's the length of the coastline
p105
aVof these lakes?
p106
aVThe closer you measure, the longer it is.
p107
aVThe concept of length of coastline,
p108
aVwhich seems to be so natural
p109
aVbecause it's given in many cases,
p110
aVis, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.
p111
aVYou must do it differently.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhat good is that, to know these things?
p114
aVWell, surprisingly enough,
p115
aVit's good in many ways.
p116
aVTo begin with, artificial landscapes,
p117
aVwhich I invented sort of,
p118
aVare used in cinema all the time.
p119
aVWe see mountains in the distance.
p120
aVThey may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.
p121
aVNow it's very easy to do.
p122
aVIt used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.
p123
aVNow look at that. That's a real lung.
p124
aVNow a lung is something very strange.
p125
aVIf you take this thing,
p126
aVyou know very well it weighs very little.
p127
aVThe volume of a lung is very small,
p128
aVbut what about the area of the lung?
p129
aVAnatomists were arguing very much about that.
p130
aVSome say that a normal male's lung
p131
aVhas an area of the inside
p132
aVof a basketball [court].
p133
aVAnd the others say, no, five basketball [courts].
p134
aVEnormous disagreements.
p135
aVWhy so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung
p136
aVis something very ill-defined.
p137
aVThe bronchi branch, branch, branch
p138
aVand they stop branching,
p139
aVnot because of any matter of principle,
p140
aVbut because of physical considerations:
p141
aVthe mucus, which is in the lung.
p142
aVSo what happens is that in a way
p143
aVyou have a much bigger lung,
p144
aVbut it branches and branches
p145
aVdown to distances about the same for a whale, for a man
p146
aVand for a little rodent.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, what good is it to have that?
p149
aVWell, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,
p150
aVthe anatomists had a very poor idea
p151
aVof the structure of the lung until very recently.
p152
aVAnd I think that my mathematics,
p153
aVsurprisingly enough,
p154
aVhas been of great help
p155
aVto the surgeons
p156
aVstudying lung illnesses
p157
aVand also kidney illnesses,
p158
aVall these branching systems,
p159
aVfor which there was no geometry.
p160
aVSo I found myself, in other words,
p161
aVconstructing a geometry,
p162
aVa geometry of things which had no geometry.
p163
aVAnd a surprising aspect of it
p164
aVis that very often, the rules of this geometry
p165
aVare extremely short.
p166
aVYou have formulas that long.
p167
aVAnd you crank it several times.
p168
aVSometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,
p169
aVthe same repetition.
p170
aVAnd at the end, you get things like that.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis cloud is completely,
p173
aV100 percent artificial.
p174
aVWell, 99.9.
p175
aVAnd the only part which is natural
p176
aVis a number, the roughness of the cloud,
p177
aVwhich is taken from nature.
p178
aVSomething so complicated like a cloud,
p179
aVso unstable, so varying,
p180
aVshould have a simple rule behind it.
p181
aVNow this simple rule
p182
aVis not an explanation of clouds.
p183
aVThe seer of clouds had to
p184
aVtake account of it.
p185
aVI don't know how much advanced
p186
aVthese pictures are. They're old.
p187
aVI was very much involved in it,
p188
aVbut then turned my attention to other phenomena.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, here is another thing
p191
aVwhich is rather interesting.
p192
aVOne of the shattering events
p193
aVin the history of mathematics,
p194
aVwhich is not appreciated by many people,
p195
aVoccurred about 130 years ago,
p196
aV145 years ago.
p197
aVMathematicians began to create
p198
aVshapes that didn't exist.
p199
aVMathematicians got into self-praise
p200
aVto an extent which was absolutely amazing,
p201
aVthat man can invent things
p202
aVthat nature did not know.
p203
aVIn particular, it could invent
p204
aVthings like a curve which fills the plane.
p205
aVA curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,
p206
aVand the two won't mix.
p207
aVWell, they do mix.
p208
aVA man named Peano
p209
aVdid define such curves,
p210
aVand it became an object of extraordinary interest.
p211
aVIt was very important, but mostly interesting
p212
aVbecause a kind of break,
p213
aVa separation between
p214
aVthe mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,
p215
aVand new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.
p216
aVWell, I was very sorry to point out
p217
aVthat the pure man's mind
p218
aVhas, in fact,
p219
aVseen at long last
p220
aVwhat had been seen for a long time.
p221
aVAnd so here I introduce something,
p222
aVthe set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.
p223
aVAnd well,
p224
aVit's a story unto itself.
p225
aVSo it was in 1875 to 1925,
p226
aVan extraordinary period
p227
aVin which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.
p228
aVAnd the objects which were used
p229
aVas examples, when I was
p230
aVa child and a student, as examples
p231
aVof the break between mathematics
p232
aVand visible reality \u2014
p233
aVthose objects,
p234
aVI turned them completely around.
p235
aVI used them for describing
p236
aVsome of the aspects of the complexity of nature.
p237
aa(lp238
VWell, a man named Hausdorff in 1919
p239
aVintroduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,
p240
aVand I found that this number
p241
aVwas a good measurement of roughness.
p242
aVWhen I first told it to my friends in mathematics
p243
aVthey said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."
p244
aVWell actually, I was not silly.
p245
aVThe great painter Hokusai knew it very well.
p246
aVThe things on the ground are algae.
p247
aVHe did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.
p248
aVAnd he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.
p249
aVBut painting for a long time had a fractal side.
p250
aVI could speak of that for a long time.
p251
aVThe Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.
p252
aVI read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,
p253
aVand indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.
p254
aa(lp255
VThis is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.
p256
aVOne day I decided \u2014
p257
aVhalfway through my career,
p258
aVI was held by so many things in my work \u2014
p259
aVI decided to test myself.
p260
aVCould I just look at something
p261
aVwhich everybody had been looking at for a long time
p262
aVand find something dramatically new?
p263
aVWell, so I looked at these
p264
aVthings called Brownian motion \u2014 just goes around.
p265
aVI played with it for a while,
p266
aVand I made it return to the origin.
p267
aVThen I was telling my assistant,
p268
aV"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"
p269
aVSo he painted it, which means
p270
aVhe put inside everything. He said:
p271
aV"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!
p272
aVI see; it's an island."
p273
aVAnd amazing.
p274
aVSo Brownian motion, which happens to have
p275
aVa roughness number of two, goes around.
p276
aVI measured it, 1.33.
p277
aVAgain, again, again.
p278
aVLong measurements, big Brownian motions,
p279
aV1.33.
p280
aVMathematical problem: how to prove it?
p281
aVIt took my friends 20 years.
p282
aVThree of them were having incomplete proofs.
p283
aVThey got together, and together they had the proof.
p284
aVSo they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,
p285
aVone of the three medals that people have received
p286
aVfor proving things which I've seen
p287
aVwithout being able to prove them.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow everybody asks me at one point or another,
p290
aV"How did it all start?
p291
aVWhat got you in that strange business?"
p292
aVWhat got you to be,
p293
aVat the same time, a mechanical engineer,
p294
aVa geographer
p295
aVand a mathematician and so on, a physicist?
p296
aVWell actually I started, oddly enough,
p297
aVstudying stock market prices.
p298
aVAnd so here
p299
aVI had this theory,
p300
aVand I wrote books about it \u2014
p301
aVfinancial prices increments.
p302
aVTo the left you see data over a long period.
p303
aVTo the right, on top,
p304
aVyou see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
p305
aVIt was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aVThere are thousands of books on that.
p308
aVNow compare that with real price increments.
p309
aVWhere are real price increments?
p310
aVWell, these other lines
p311
aVinclude some real price increments
p312
aVand some forgery which I did.
p313
aVSo the idea there was
p314
aVthat one must be able to \u2014 how do you say? \u2014
p315
aVmodel price variation.
p316
aVAnd it went really well 50 years ago.
p317
aVFor 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me
p318
aVbecause they could do it much, much easier.
p319
aVBut I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.
p320
aV(Laughter)
p321
aVThese two curves are averages:
p322
aVStandard & Poor, the blue one;
p323
aVand the red one is Standard & Poor's
p324
aVfrom which the five biggest discontinuities
p325
aVare taken out.
p326
aVNow discontinuities are a nuisance,
p327
aVso in many studies of prices,
p328
aVone puts them aside.
p329
aV"Well, acts of God.
p330
aVAnd you have the little nonsense which is left.
p331
aVActs of God." In this picture,
p332
aVfive acts of God are as important as everything else.
p333
aVIn other words,
p334
aVit is not acts of God that we should put aside.
p335
aVThat is the meat, the problem.
p336
aVIf you master these, you master price,
p337
aVand if you don't master these, you can master
p338
aVthe little noise as well as you can,
p339
aVbut it's not important.
p340
aVWell, here are the curves for it.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, I get to the final thing, which is the set
p343
aVof which my name is attached.
p344
aVIn a way, it's the story of my life.
p345
aVMy adolescence was spent
p346
aVduring the German occupation of France.
p347
aVSince I thought that I might
p348
aVvanish within a day or a week,
p349
aVI had very big dreams.
p350
aVAnd after the war,
p351
aVI saw an uncle again.
p352
aVMy uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,
p353
aV"Look, there's a problem
p354
aVwhich I could not solve 25 years ago,
p355
aVand which nobody can solve.
p356
aVThis is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia
p357
aVand [Pierre] Fatou.
p358
aVIf you could
p359
aVfind something new, anything,
p360
aVyou will get your career made."
p361
aVVery simple.
p362
aVSo I looked,
p363
aVand like the thousands of people that had tried before,
p364
aVI found nothing.
p365
aa(lp366
VBut then the computer came,
p367
aVand I decided to apply the computer,
p368
aVnot to new problems in mathematics \u2014
p369
aVlike this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem \u2014
p370
aVbut to old problems.
p371
aVAnd I went from what's called
p372
aVreal numbers, which are points on a line,
p373
aVto imaginary, complex numbers,
p374
aVwhich are points on a plane,
p375
aVwhich is what one should do there,
p376
aVand this shape came out.
p377
aVThis shape is of an extraordinary complication.
p378
aVThe equation is hidden there,
p379
aVz goes into z squared, plus c.
p380
aVIt's so simple, so dry.
p381
aVIt's so uninteresting.
p382
aVNow you turn the crank once, twice:
p383
aVtwice,
p384
aVmarvels come out.
p385
aVI mean this comes out.
p386
aVI don't want to explain these things.
p387
aVThis comes out. This comes out.
p388
aVShapes which are of such complication,
p389
aVsuch harmony and such beauty.
p390
aVThis comes out
p391
aVrepeatedly, again, again, again.
p392
aVAnd that was one of my major discoveries,
p393
aVto find that these islands were the same
p394
aVas the whole big thing, more or less.
p395
aVAnd then you get these
p396
aVextraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.
p397
aVAll that from this little formula,
p398
aVwhich has whatever, five symbols in it.
p399
aVAnd then this one.
p400
aVThe color was added for two reasons.
p401
aVFirst of all, because these shapes
p402
aVare so complicated
p403
aVthat one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.
p404
aVAnd if you plot them, you must choose some system.
p405
aVAnd so my principle has been
p406
aVto always present the shapes
p407
aVwith different colorings
p408
aVbecause some colorings emphasize that,
p409
aVand others it is that or that.
p410
aVIt's so complicated.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VIn 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.
p415
aVto receive a prize from the university,
p416
aVand three days later,
p417
aVa pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.
p418
aVSo where did this come from?
p419
aVObviously, from extraterrestrials.
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aVWell, so the newspaper in Cambridge
p422
aVpublished an article about that "discovery"
p423
aVand received the next day
p424
aV5,000 letters from people saying,
p425
aV"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."
p426
aa(lp427
VWell, let me finish.
p428
aVThis shape here just came
p429
aVout of an exercise in pure mathematics.
p430
aVBottomless wonders spring from simple rules,
p431
aVwhich are repeated without end.
