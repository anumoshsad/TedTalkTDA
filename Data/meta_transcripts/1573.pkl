VOther people. Everyone is interested in other people.
p4
aVEveryone has relationships with other people,
p5
aVand they're interested in these relationships
p6
aVfor a variety of reasons.
p7
aVGood relationships, bad relationships,
p8
aVannoying relationships, agnostic relationships,
p9
aVand what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece
p10
aVof an interaction that goes on in a relationship.
p11
aVSo I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all
p12
aVinterested in interacting with other people,
p13
aVI'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,
p14
aVand I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,
p15
aVinto a scientific probe, and provide the early stages,
p16
aVembryonic stages of new insights into what happens
p17
aVin two brains while they simultaneously interact.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things
p20
aVthat made this possible.
p21
aVThe first is we can now eavesdrop safely
p22
aVon healthy brain activity.
p23
aVWithout needles and radioactivity,
p24
aVwithout any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street
p25
aVand record from your friends' and neighbors' brains
p26
aVwhile they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use
p27
aVa method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
p28
aVYou've probably all read about it or heard about in some
p29
aVincarnation. Let me give you a two-sentence version of it.
p30
aVSo we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields
p31
aVand radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain
p32
aVor your knee or your stomach,
p33
aVgrayscale images that are frozen in time.
p34
aVIn the 1990s, it was discovered you could use
p35
aVthe same machines in a different mode,
p36
aVand in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow
p37
aVmovies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.
p38
aVOkay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain,
p39
aVchanges in neural activity, the things that make your brain work,
p40
aVthe things that make your software work in your brain,
p41
aVare tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.
p42
aVYou make a blood flow movie, you have an independent
p43
aVproxy of brain activity.
p44
aa(lp45
VThis has literally revolutionized cognitive science.
p46
aVTake any cognitive domain you want, memory,
p47
aVmotor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law,
p48
aVgetting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on,
p49
aVput people into functional MRI devices, and
p50
aVimage how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.
p51
aVIt's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures,
p52
aVbut in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.
p53
aVYou couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people.
p54
aVThat's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up
p55
aVto a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists,
p56
aVas you well know, have lots of experimental preps,
p57
aVworms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this.
p58
aVAnd now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.
p59
aVWe can now use human beings to study and model
p60
aVthe software in human beings, and we have a few
p61
aVburgeoning biological measures.
p62
aa(lp63
VOkay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do,
p64
aVand it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.
p65
aVValuation is just what you think it is, you know?
p66
aVIf you went and you were valuing two companies against
p67
aVone another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.
p68
aVCultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.
p69
aVIf you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?
p70
aVWell, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
p71
aVThey're immiscible. They don't mix with one another.
p72
aVSo instead, you convert them to a common currency scale,
p73
aVput them on that scale, and value them accordingly.
p74
aVWell, your brain has to do something just like that as well,
p75
aVand we're now beginning to understand and identify
p76
aVbrain systems involved in valuation,
p77
aVand one of them includes a neurotransmitter system
p78
aVwhose cells are located in your brainstem
p79
aVand deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.
p80
aVI won't go through the details of it, but that's an important
p81
aVdiscovery, and we know a good bit about that now,
p82
aVand it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because
p83
aVthose are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease,
p84
aVand they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally
p85
aVevery drug of abuse, and that makes sense.
p86
aVDrugs of abuse would come in, and they would change
p87
aVthe way you value the world. They change the way
p88
aVyou value the symbols associated with your drug of choice,
p89
aVand they make you value that over everything else.
p90
aa(lp91
VHere's the key feature though. These neurons are also
p92
aVinvolved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas,
p93
aVand I put some symbols up here that we assign value to
p94
aVfor various reasons.
p95
aVWe have a behavioral superpower in our brain,
p96
aVand it at least in part involves dopamine.
p97
aVWe can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea,
p98
aVfor a mere idea. No other species can do that.
p99
aVIn 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide
p100
aVpredicated on the idea that there was a spaceship
p101
aVhiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp
p102
aVwaiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event.
p103
aVMore than two thirds of them had college degrees.
p104
aVBut the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival
p105
aVusing exactly the same systems that were put there
p106
aVto make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay?
p107
aa(lp108
VOne thing that I've left out of this narrative
p109
aVis the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my
p110
aVlittle talk, and that is other people.
p111
aVThese same valuation systems are redeployed
p112
aVwhen we're valuing interactions with other people.
p113
aVSo this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs,
p114
aVthat makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease,
p115
aVthat contributes to various forms of psychosis,
p116
aVis also redeployed to value interactions with other people
p117
aVand to assign value to gestures that you do
p118
aVwhen you're interacting with somebody else.
p119
aa(lp120
VLet me give you an example of this.
p121
aVYou bring to the table such enormous processing power
p122
aVin this domain that you hardly even notice it.
p123
aa(lp124
VLet me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby.
p125
aVShe's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus.
p126
aVShe's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen.
p127
aVYou can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read
p128
aVsomething in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity
p129
aVin one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.
p130
aa(lp131
VHere's a couple. They're sharing a moment together,
p132
aVand we've even done an experiment where you can cut out
p133
aVdifferent pieces of this frame and you can still see
p134
aVthat they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel.
p135
aVNow, the elements of the scene also communicate this
p136
aVto us, but you can read it straight off their faces,
p137
aVand if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.
p138
aa(lp139
VHere's another couple. He's projecting out at us,
p140
aVand she's clearly projecting, you know,
p141
aVlove and admiration at him.
p142
aa(lp143
VHere's another couple. (Laughter)
p144
aVAnd I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter)
p145
aVIn fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see
p146
aVhim saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera,
p147
aVand then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face." (Laughter)
p148
aVHe'll kill me for showing that.
p149
aa(lp150
VAll right, so what does this mean?
p151
aVIt means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.
p152
aVIt engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic
p153
aVsystems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.
p154
aVThey keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives
p155
aVthat kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged
p158
aVsocial interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?
p159
aVAnd the short answer is games.
p160
aVEconomic games. So what we do is we go into two areas.
p161
aVOne area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics.
p162
aVAnd we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes.
p163
aVSo this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.
p164
aVRed person is given a hundred dollars and can offer
p165
aVa split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70,
p166
aVand offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue.
p167
aVControl passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it,"
p168
aVin which case he'd get the money, or blue says,
p169
aV"I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay?
p170
aVSo a rational choice economist would say, well,
p171
aVyou should take all non-zero offers.
p172
aVWhat do people do? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split.
p173
aVAt 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not.
p174
aVWhy is that? You know, because you're pissed off.
p175
aVYou're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is.
p176
aVThis is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.
p177
aVThat just gives you an example of the kind of thing that
p178
aVthese games probe. The interesting thing is, these games
p179
aVrequire that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line.
p180
aVYou have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.
p181
aVYou have to be able to remember what you've done.
p182
aVYou have to stand up in the moment to do that.
p183
aVThen you have to update your model based on the signals coming back,
p184
aVand you have to do something that is interesting,
p185
aVwhich is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
p186
aVThat is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.
p187
aVYou have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.
p188
aVLike a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody,
p189
aVthey have some prior image of you,
p190
aVyou send signals across the desk to move their image
p191
aVof you from one place to a place where you want it to be.
p192
aVWe're so good at this we don't really even notice it.
p193
aVThese kinds of probes exploit it. Okay?
p194
aa(lp195
VIn doing this, what we've discovered is that humans
p196
aVare literal canaries in social exchanges.
p197
aVCanaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.
p198
aVWhen methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up,
p199
aVor oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon
p200
aVbefore people would \u2014 so it acted as an early warning system:
p201
aVHey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.
p202
aVPeople come to the table, and even these very blunt,
p203
aVstaged social interactions, and they, and there's just
p204
aVnumbers going back and forth between the people,
p205
aVand they bring enormous sensitivities to it.
p206
aVSo we realized we could exploit this, and in fact,
p207
aVas we've done that, and we've done this now in
p208
aVmany thousands of people, I think on the order of
p209
aVfive or six thousand. We actually, to make this
p210
aVa biological probe, need bigger numbers than that,
p211
aVremarkably so. But anyway,
p212
aVpatterns have emerged, and we've been able to take
p213
aVthose patterns, convert them into mathematical models,
p214
aVand use those mathematical models to gain new insights
p215
aVinto these exchanges. Okay, so what?
p216
aVWell, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure,
p217
aVthe economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.
p218
aVWe can compute that during the game.
p219
aVAnd we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.
p220
aa(lp221
VHere's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago,
p222
aVwe developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.
p223
aVIt's now in Virginia and London. And we built software
p224
aVthat'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices
p225
aVup over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines
p226
aVat a time, but let's just focus on two.
p227
aVSo it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world.
p228
aVWe synchronize the machines, set them into these
p229
aVstaged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both
p230
aVof the interacting brains. So for the first time,
p231
aVwe don't have to look at just averages over single individuals,
p232
aVor have individuals playing computers, or try to make
p233
aVinferences that way. We can study individual dyads.
p234
aVWe can study the way that one person interacts with another person,
p235
aVturn the numbers up, and start to gain new insights
p236
aVinto the boundaries of normal cognition,
p237
aVbut more importantly, we can put people with
p238
aVclassically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage,
p239
aVinto these social interactions, and use these as probes of that.
p240
aVSo we've started this effort. We've made a few hits,
p241
aVa few, I think, embryonic discoveries.
p242
aVWe think there's a future to this. But it's our way
p243
aVof going in and redefining, with a new lexicon,
p244
aVa mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard
p245
aVways that we think about mental illness,
p246
aVcharacterizing these diseases, by using the people
p247
aVas birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact
p248
aVthat the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression,
p249
aVor playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder,
p250
aVor playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
p251
aVwe use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use
p252
aVcomputer programs to model that person, and it gives us
p253
aVa kind of assay of this.
p254
aa(lp255
VEarly days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites
p256
aVaround the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites.
p257
aVThe hub, ironically enough,
p258
aVis centered in little Roanoke, Virginia.
p259
aVThere's another hub in London, now, and the rest
p260
aVare getting set up. We hope to give the data away
p261
aVat some stage. That's a complicated issue
p262
aVabout making it available to the rest of the world.
p263
aVBut we're also studying just a small part
p264
aVof what makes us interesting as human beings, and so
p265
aVI would invite other people who are interested in this
p266
aVto ask us for the software, or even for guidance
p267
aVon how to move forward with that.
p268
aa(lp269
VLet me leave you with one thought in closing.
p270
aVThe interesting thing about studying cognition
p271
aVhas been that we've been limited, in a way.
p272
aVWe just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains
p273
aVsimultaneously.
p274
aVThe fact is, though, that even when we're alone,
p275
aVwe're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind
p276
aVbuilt out of properties that kept it alive in the world
p277
aVindependent of other people. In fact, our minds
p278
aVdepend on other people. They depend on other people,
p279
aVand they're expressed in other people,
p280
aVso the notion of who you are, you often don't know
p281
aVwho you are until you see yourself in interaction with people
p282
aVthat are close to you, people that are enemies of you,
p283
aVpeople that are agnostic to you.
p284
aVSo this is the first sort of step into using that insight
p285
aVinto what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool,
p286
aVand trying to gain new insights into mental illness.
p287
aVThanks for having me. (Applause)
