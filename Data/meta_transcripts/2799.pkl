VSo, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999.
p4
aVI was a senior in college,
p5
aVand it was right after a dance practice.
p6
aVI was really, really happy.
p7
aVAnd I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.
p8
aVI was sitting in the back of my used minivan
p9
aVin a campus parking lot,
p10
aVwhen I decided
p11
aVI was going to commit suicide.
p12
aVI went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly.
p13
aVAnd I came this close to the edge of the precipice.
p14
aVIt's the closest I've ever come.
p15
aVAnd the only reason I took my finger off the trigger
p16
aVwas thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
p17
aVAnd after the fact,
p18
aVthat's what scared me the most: the element of chance.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I became very methodical about testing different ways
p21
aVthat I could manage my ups and downs,
p22
aVwhich has proven to be a good investment. (Laughs)
p23
aVMany normal people might have, say, six to 10 major depressive episodes
p24
aVin their lives.
p25
aVI have bipolar depression. It runs in my family.
p26
aVI've had 50-plus at this point,
p27
aVand I've learned a lot.
p28
aVI've had a lot of at-bats,
p29
aVmany rounds in the ring with darkness,
p30
aVtaking good notes.
p31
aVSo I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success
p32
aVor highlight reel,
p33
aVI would share my recipe for avoiding self-destruction,
p34
aVand certainly self-paralysis.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd the tool I've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net
p37
aVfor emotional free fall
p38
aVis actually the same tool
p39
aVthat has helped me to make my best business decisions.
p40
aVBut that is secondary.
p41
aVAnd it is ... stoicism.
p42
aVThat sounds boring.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VYou might think of Spock,
p47
aVor it might conjure and image like this \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
Va cow standing in the rain.
p52
aVIt's not sad. It's not particularly happy.
p53
aVIt's just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way.
p54
aa(lp55
VYou might not think of the ultimate competitor, say, Bill Belichick,
p56
aVhead coach of the New England Patriots,
p57
aVwho has the all-time NFL record for Super Bowl titles.
p58
aVAnd stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks
p59
aVas a means of mental toughness training in the last few years.
p60
aVYou might not think of the Founding Fathers \u2014
p61
aVThomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington
p62
aVto name but three students of stoicism.
p63
aVGeorge Washington actually had a play about a Stoic \u2014
p64
aVthis was "Cato, a Tragedy" \u2014
p65
aVperformed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy?
p68
aVThis seems very academic.
p69
aVI would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently,
p70
aVas an operating system for thriving in high-stress environments,
p71
aVfor making better decisions.
p72
aVAnd it all started here,
p73
aVkind of,
p74
aVon a porch.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo around 300 BC in Athens,
p77
aVsomeone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures
p78
aVwalking around a painted porch, a "stoa."
p79
aVThat later became "stoicism."
p80
aVAnd in the Greco-Roman world,
p81
aVpeople used stoicism as a comprehensive system
p82
aVfor doing many, many things.
p83
aVBut for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself
p84
aVto separate what you can control from what you cannot control,
p85
aVand then doing exercises to focus exclusively
p86
aVon the former.
p87
aVThis decreases emotional reactivity,
p88
aVwhich can be a superpower.
p89
aa(lp90
VConversely, let's say you're a quarterback.
p91
aVYou miss a pass. You get furious with yourself.
p92
aVThat could cost you a game.
p93
aVIf you're a CEO, and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee
p94
aVbecause of a minor infraction,
p95
aVthat could cost you the employee.
p96
aVIf you're a college student who, say, is in a downward spiral,
p97
aVand you feel helpless and hopeless,
p98
aVunabated, that could cost you your life.
p99
aVSo the stakes are very, very high.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there.
p102
aVI'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004.
p103
aVIt found me then because of two things:
p104
aVa very close friend, young guy, my age, died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,
p105
aVand then my girlfriend, who I thought I was going to marry, walked out.
p106
aVShe'd had enough, and she didn't give me a Dear John letter,
p107
aVbut she did give me this,
p108
aVa Dear John plaque.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VI'm not making this up. I've kept it.
p113
aV"Business hours are over at five o'clock."
p114
aVShe gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health,
p115
aVbecause at the time, I was working on my first real business.
p116
aVI had no idea what I was doing. I was working 14-plus hour days,
p117
aVseven days a week.
p118
aVI was using stimulants to get going.
p119
aVI was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep.
p120
aVIt was a disaster.
p121
aVI felt completely trapped.
p122
aVI bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life,
p125
aVwhich was, "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality,"
p126
aVby Seneca the Younger,
p127
aVwho was a famous Stoic writer.
p128
aVThat took me to his letters,
p129
aVwhich took me to the exercise,
p130
aV"premeditatio malorum,"
p131
aVwhich means the pre-meditation of evils.
p132
aVIn simple terms,
p133
aVthis is visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear,
p134
aVpreventing you from taking action,
p135
aVso that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.
p136
aVMy problem was monkey mind \u2014 super loud, very incessant.
p137
aVJust thinking my way through problems doesn't work.
p138
aVI needed to capture my thoughts on paper.
p139
aVSo I created a written exercise
p140
aVthat I called "fear-setting," like goal-setting,
p141
aVfor myself.
p142
aVIt consists of three pages.
p143
aVSuper simple.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe first page is right here.
p146
aV"What if I ...?"
p147
aVThis is whatever you fear,
p148
aVwhatever is causing you anxiety,
p149
aVwhatever you're putting off.
p150
aVIt could be asking someone out,
p151
aVending a relationship,
p152
aVasking for a promotion, quitting a job, starting a company.
p153
aVIt could be anything.
p154
aVFor me, it was taking my first vacation in four years
p155
aVand stepping away from my business for a month to go to London,
p156
aVwhere I could stay in a friend's room for free,
p157
aVto either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business
p158
aVor shut it down.
p159
aa(lp160
VIn the first column, "Define,"
p161
aVyou're writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening
p162
aVif you take that step.
p163
aVYou want 10 to 20.
p164
aVI won't go through all of them, but I'll give you two examples.
p165
aVOne was, I'll go to London, it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,
p166
aVthe whole thing will be a huge waste of time.
p167
aVNumber two, I'll miss a letter from the IRS,
p168
aVand I'll get audited
p169
aVor raided or shut down or some such.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd then you go to the "Prevent" column.
p172
aVIn that column, you write down the answer to:
p173
aVWhat could I do to prevent each of these bullets from happening,
p174
aVor, at the very least, decrease the likelihood even a little bit?
p175
aVSo for getting depressed in London,
p176
aVI could take a portable blue light with me
p177
aVand use it for 15 minutes in the morning.
p178
aVI knew that helped stave off depressive episodes.
p179
aVFor the IRS bit, I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS
p180
aVso the paperwork would go to my accountant
p181
aVinstead of to my UPS address.
p182
aVEasy-peasy.
p183
aa(lp184
VThen we go to "Repair."
p185
aVSo if the worst-case scenarios happen,
p186
aVwhat could you do to repair the damage even a little bit,
p187
aVor who could you ask for help?
p188
aVSo in the first case, London,
p189
aVwell, I could fork over some money, fly to Spain, get some sun \u2014
p190
aVundo the damage, if I got into a funk.
p191
aVIn the case of missing a letter from the IRS,
p192
aVI could call a friend who is a lawyer
p193
aVor ask, say, a professor of law
p194
aVwhat they would recommend,
p195
aVwho I should talk to, how had people handled this in the past.
p196
aVSo one question to keep in mind as you're doing this first page is:
p197
aVHas anyone else in the history of time
p198
aVless intelligent or less driven
p199
aVfigured this out?
p200
aVChances are, the answer is "Yes."
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VThe second page is simple:
p205
aVWhat might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success?
p206
aVYou can see we're playing up the fears
p207
aVand really taking a conservative look at the upside.
p208
aVSo if you attempted whatever you're considering,
p209
aVmight you build confidence, develop skills,
p210
aVemotionally, financially, otherwise?
p211
aVWhat might be the benefits of, say, a base hit?
p212
aVSpend 10 to 15 minutes on this.
p213
aa(lp214
VPage three.
p215
aVThis might be the most important, so don't skip it:
p216
aV"The Cost of Inaction."
p217
aVHumans are very good at considering what might go wrong
p218
aVif we try something new, say, ask for a raise.
p219
aVWhat we don't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo \u2014
p220
aVnot changing anything.
p221
aVSo you should ask yourself,
p222
aVif I avoid this action or decision
p223
aVand actions and decisions like it,
p224
aVwhat might my life look like in, say, six months, 12 months, three years?
p225
aVAny further out, it starts to seem intangible.
p226
aVAnd really get detailed \u2014 again, emotionally, financially,
p227
aVphysically, whatever.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd when I did this, it painted a terrifying picture.
p230
aVI was self-medicating,
p231
aVmy business was going to implode at any moment at all times,
p232
aVif I didn't step away.
p233
aVMy relationships were fraying or failing.
p234
aVAnd I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me.
p235
aa(lp236
VThose are the three pages. That's it. That's fear-setting.
p237
aVAnd after this, I realized that on a scale of one to 10,
p238
aVone being minimal impact, 10 being maximal impact,
p239
aVif I took the trip, I was risking
p240
aVa one to three of temporary and reversible pain
p241
aVfor an eight to 10 of positive, life-changing impact
p242
aVthat could be a semi-permanent.
p243
aVSo I took the trip.
p244
aVNone of the disasters came to pass.
p245
aVThere were some hiccups, sure.
p246
aVI was able to extricate myself from the business.
p247
aVI ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world,
p248
aVand that became the basis for my first book,
p249
aVthat leads me here today.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd I can trace all of my biggest wins
p252
aVand all of my biggest disasters averted
p253
aVback to doing fear-setting
p254
aVat least once a quarter.
p255
aVIt's not a panacea.
p256
aVYou'll find that some of your fears are very well-founded.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut you shouldn't conclude that
p261
aVwithout first putting them under a microscope.
p262
aVAnd it doesn't make all the hard times, the hard choices, easy,
p263
aVbut it can make a lot of them easier.
p264
aa(lp265
VI'd like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.
p266
aVThis is Jerzy Gregorek.
p267
aVHe is a four-time world champion in Olympic weightlifting,
p268
aVpolitical refugee,
p269
aVpublished poet,
p270
aV62 years old.
p271
aVHe can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room.
p272
aVHe's an impressive guy.
p273
aa(lp274
VI spent a lot of time on his stoa, his porch,
p275
aVasking life and training advice.
p276
aVHe was part of the Solidarity in Poland,
p277
aVwhich was a nonviolent movement for social change
p278
aVthat was violently suppressed by the government.
p279
aVHe lost his career as a firefighter.
p280
aVThen his mentor, a priest, was kidnapped, tortured, killed
p281
aVand thrown into a river.
p282
aVHe was then threatened.
p283
aVHe and his wife had to flee Poland, bounce from country to country
p284
aVuntil they landed in the US with next to nothing,
p285
aVsleeping on floors.
p286
aa(lp287
VHe now lives in Woodside, California, in a very nice place,
p288
aVand of the 10,000-plus people I've met in my life,
p289
aVI would put him in the top 10,
p290
aVin terms of success and happiness.
p291
aVAnd there's a punchline coming, so pay attention.
p292
aVI sent him a text a few weeks ago,
p293
aVasking him: Had he ever read any Stoic philosophy?
p294
aVAnd he replied with two pages of text.
p295
aVThis is very unlike him. He is a terse dude.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd not only was he familiar with stoicism,
p300
aVbut he pointed out, for all of his most important decisions,
p301
aVhis inflection points,
p302
aVwhen he stood up for his principles and ethics,
p303
aVhow he had used stoicism and something akin to fear-setting,
p304
aVwhich blew my mind.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd he closed with two things.
p307
aVNumber one: he couldn't imagine any life more beautiful
p308
aVthan that of a Stoic.
p309
aVAnd the last was his mantra, which he applies to everything,
p310
aVand you can apply to everything:
p311
aa(lp312
V"Easy choices, hard life.
p313
aVHard choices, easy life."
p314
aa(lp315
VThe hard choices \u2014
p316
aVwhat we most fear doing, asking, saying \u2014
p317
aVthese are very often exactly what we most need to do.
p318
aVAnd the biggest challenges and problems we face
p319
aVwill never be solved with comfortable conversations,
p320
aVwhether it's in your own head or with other people.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo I encourage you to ask yourselves:
p323
aVWhere in your lives right now
p324
aVmight defining your fears be more important than defining your goals?
p325
aVKeeping in mind all the while, the words of Seneca:
p326
aV"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."
p327
aa(lp328
VThank you very much.
