VI'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
p4
aVI've been making games online now for 10 years,
p5
aVand my goal for the next decade
p6
aVis to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life
p7
aVas it is to save the world in online games.
p8
aVNow, I have a plan for this,
p9
aVand it entails convincing more people,
p10
aVincluding all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
p11
aa(lp12
VRight now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
p13
aVSome of you might be thinking,
p14
aV"That's a lot of time to spend playing games.
p15
aVMaybe too much time,
p16
aVconsidering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."
p17
aVBut actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future,
p18
aVactually the opposite is true.
p19
aVThree billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play
p20
aVto solve the world's most urgent problems.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn fact, I believe that if we want to survive
p23
aVthe next century on this planet,
p24
aVwe need to increase that total dramatically.
p25
aVI've calculated the total we need
p26
aVat 21 billion hours of game play every week.
p27
aVSo, that's probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea,
p28
aVso I'll say it again, let it sink in:
p29
aVIf we want to solve problems like hunger,
p30
aVpoverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,
p31
aVI believe that we need to aspire to play games online
p32
aVfor at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VNo. I'm serious. I am.
p37
aa(lp38
VHere's why.
p39
aVThis picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential
p40
aVto the future survival of the human species.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VTruly.
p45
aVThis is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
p46
aVHe wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,
p47
aVso he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.
p48
aVAnd this is a classic gaming emotion.
p49
aVNow, if you're not a gamer,
p50
aVyou might miss some of the nuance in this photo.
p51
aVYou probably see the sense of urgency,
p52
aVa little bit of fear, but intense concentration,
p53
aVdeep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.
p54
aa(lp55
VIf you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here:
p56
aVthe crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth
p57
aVis a sign of optimism,
p58
aVand the eyebrows up is surprise.
p59
aVThis is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an "epic win."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VOh, you've heard of that.
p64
aVOK, good, so we have some gamers among us.
p65
aVAn epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive,
p66
aVyou had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.
p67
aVIt was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there,
p68
aVyou're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of.
p69
aVThat's an epic win.
p70
aVThis is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.
p71
aVAnd this is the face that we need to see
p72
aVon millions of problem-solvers all over the world
p73
aVas we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century \u2014
p74
aVthe face of someone who, against all odds,
p75
aVis on the verge of an epic win.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see
p78
aVin everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.
p79
aVThis is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
p80
aVThis is actually me making it.
p81
aVCan you see? Yes. Good.
p82
aVThis is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
p83
aVThis is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood
p84
aVin Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD
p85
aVon why we're better in games than we are in real life.
p86
aVAnd this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.
p87
aVWe feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.
p88
aa(lp89
VI don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.
p90
aVWe do achieve more in game worlds.
p91
aVBut I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters \u2014
p92
aVinspired to collaborate and to cooperate.
p93
aVAnd when we're in game worlds,
p94
aVI believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves \u2014
p95
aVthe most likely to help at a moment's notice,
p96
aVthe most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes,
p97
aVto get up after failure and try again.
p98
aVAnd in real life, when we face failure,
p99
aVwhen we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.
p100
aVWe feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,
p101
aVwe feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.
p102
aVWe never have those feelings when we're playing games,
p103
aVthey just don't exist in games.
p104
aVSo that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
p105
aa(lp106
VWhat about games makes it impossible
p107
aVto feel that we can't achieve everything?
p108
aVHow can we take those feelings from games
p109
aVand apply them to real-world work?
p110
aVSo I looked at games like World of Warcraft,
p111
aVwhich is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.
p112
aVAnd I started to notice a few things
p113
aVthat make epic wins so possible in online worlds.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,
p116
aVespecially in World of Warcraft,
p117
aVthere are lots and lots of different characters
p118
aVwho are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.
p119
aVBut not just any mission,
p120
aVit's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.
p121
aVRight? So you can do it.
p122
aVThey never give you a challenge you can't achieve.
p123
aVBut it is on the verge of what you're capable of,
p124
aVso you have to try hard.
p125
aVBut there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,
p126
aVwringing your hands \u2014
p127
aVthere's always something specific and important to be done.
p128
aVThere are also tons of collaborators.
p129
aVEverywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people
p130
aVready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.
p131
aa(lp132
VThat's not something we have in real life that easily,
p133
aVthis sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators.
p134
aVAnd there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there,
p135
aVand what we're doing,
p136
aVand we get all this positive feedback.
p137
aVYou guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence.
p138
aVWe don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
p139
aVWhen I get off this stage,
p140
aVI'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,
p141
aV+20 crazy idea.
p142
aVI don't get that feedback in real life.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft
p145
aVis that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,
p146
aVwe decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
p147
aVIt's just better than reality.
p148
aVSo, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers
p149
aVhave spent 5.93 million years
p150
aVsolving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
p151
aVNow, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
p152
aVIt might sound like it's a bad thing.
p153
aVBut to put that in context:
p154
aV5.93 million years ago
p155
aVwas when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.
p156
aVThat was the first upright primate.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo when we talk about how much time
p159
aVwe're currently investing in playing games,
p160
aVthe only way it makes sense to even think about it
p161
aVis to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution,
p162
aVwhich is an extraordinary thing.
p163
aVBut it's also apt,
p164
aVbecause it turns out that by spending all this time playing games,
p165
aVwe're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings.
p166
aVWe're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.
p167
aVThis is true. I believe this.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, consider this really interesting statistic;
p170
aVit was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:
p171
aVThe average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture
p172
aVwill have spent 10,000 hours playing online games
p173
aVby the age of 21.
p174
aVNow 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.
p175
aVFirst of all, for children in the United States,
p176
aV10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school,
p177
aVfrom fifth grade to high school graduation,
p178
aVif you have perfect attendance.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, we have an entire parallel track of education going on,
p183
aVwhere young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer
p184
aVas they're learning about everything else in school.
p185
aVSome of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"
p186
aVso you would have heard of his theory of success,
p187
aVthe "10,000 hours" theory of success.
p188
aVIt's based on this great cognitive-science research
p189
aVthat says if we can master 10,000 hours
p190
aVof effortful study at anything by the age of 21,
p191
aVwe will be virtuosos at it.
p192
aVWe will be as good at whatever we do
p193
aVas the greatest people in the world.
p194
aVAnd so, now what we're looking at
p195
aVis an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, the big question is,
p198
aV"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?"
p199
aVBecause if we could figure that out,
p200
aVwe would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands.
p201
aVThis is how many people we now have in the world
p202
aVwho spend at least an hour a day playing online games.
p203
aVThese are our virtuoso gamers,
p204
aV500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
p205
aVAnd in the next decade,
p206
aVwe're going to have another billion gamers
p207
aVwho are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.
p208
aVIf you don't know it already, this is coming.
p209
aVThe game industry is developing consoles
p210
aVthat are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks
p211
aVinstead of broadband Internet,
p212
aVso that gamers all over the world,
p213
aVparticularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.
p214
aVThey expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.
p215
aVIt will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo I've started to think about
p218
aVwhat these games are making us virtuosos at.
p219
aVHere are the four things I came up with.
p220
aVThe first is urgent optimism.
p221
aVOK, think of this as extreme self-motivation.
p222
aVUrgent optimism is the desire to act immediately
p223
aVto tackle an obstacle,
p224
aVcombined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
p225
aVGamers always believe that an epic win is possible,
p226
aVand that it's always worth trying, and trying now.
p227
aVGamers don't sit around.
p228
aVGamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.
p229
aVThere's a lot of interesting research that shows
p230
aVwe like people better after we play a game with them,
p231
aVeven if they've beaten us badly.
p232
aVAnd the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone.
p233
aVWe trust that they will spend their time with us,
p234
aVthat they will play by the same rules,
p235
aVvalue the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd so, playing a game together
p238
aVactually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation.
p239
aVAnd we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.
p240
aVBlissful productivity. I love it.
p241
aVYou know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer
p242
aVplays for 22 hours a week \u2014 kind of a half-time job.
p243
aVIt's because we know, when we're playing a game,
p244
aVthat we're actually happier working hard
p245
aVthan we are relaxing, or hanging out.
p246
aVWe know that we are optimized as human beings,
p247
aVto do hard and meaningful work.
p248
aVAnd gamers are willing to work hard all the time,
p249
aVif they're given the right work.
p250
aa(lp251
VFinally: epic meaning.
p252
aVGamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions
p253
aVto human planetary-scale stories.
p254
aVSo, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:
p255
aVSo, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.
p256
aVSecond biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,
p257
aVis the World of Warcraft wiki.
p258
aVFive million people use it every month.
p259
aVThey have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet
p260
aVthan any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world.
p261
aVThey are building an epic story.
p262
aVThey are building an epic knowledge resource
p263
aVabout the World of Warcraft.
p264
aa(lp265
VOkay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:
p266
aVGamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals.
p267
aVThese are people who believe that they are individually capable
p268
aVof changing the world.
p269
aVAnd the only problem is,
p270
aVthey believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds
p271
aVand not the real world.
p272
aVThat's the problem that I'm trying to solve.
p273
aa(lp274
VThere's an economist named Edward Castronova.
p275
aVHis work is brilliant.
p276
aVHe looks at why people are investing so much time and energy
p277
aVand money in online worlds.
p278
aVAnd he says,
p279
aV"We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus
p280
aVto virtual worlds and online game environments."
p281
aVAnd he's an economist, so he's rational.
p282
aVAnd he says \u2014
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VNot like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
p287
aVBut he says that this makes perfect sense,
p288
aVbecause gamers can achieve more in online worlds
p289
aVthan they can in real life.
p290
aVThey can have stronger social relationships in games
p291
aVthan they can have in real life;
p292
aVthey get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games
p293
aVthan they do in real life.
p294
aVSo he says, for now it makes perfect sense
p295
aVfor gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.
p296
aVNow, I also agree that that is rational, for now.
p297
aVBut it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.
p298
aVWe have to start making the real world work more like a game.
p299
aa(lp300
VI take my inspiration from something that happened
p301
aV2,500 years ago.
p302
aVThese are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles.
p303
aVBefore we had awesome game controllers,
p304
aVwe had sheep's knuckles.
p305
aVAnd these represent the first game equipment
p306
aVdesigned by human beings,
p307
aVand if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
p308
aVyou might know this history,
p309
aVwhich is the history of who invented games and why.
p310
aVHerodotus says that games, particularly dice games,
p311
aVwere invented in the kingdom of Lydia,
p312
aVduring a time of famine.
p313
aa(lp314
VApparently, there was such a severe famine
p315
aVthat the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy.
p316
aVPeople were suffering. People were fighting.
p317
aVIt was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.
p318
aVSo, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,
p319
aVand they set up a kingdom-wide policy:
p320
aVOn one day, everybody would eat,
p321
aVand on the next day, everybody would play games.
p322
aVAnd they would be so immersed in playing the dice games,
p323
aVbecause games are so engaging,
p324
aVand immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,
p325
aVthey would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.
p326
aVAnd then on the next day, they would play games;
p327
aVand on the next day, they would eat.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd according to Herodotus,
p330
aVthey passed 18 years this way,
p331
aVsurviving through a famine,
p332
aVby eating on one day, and playing games on the next.
p333
aVNow, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today.
p334
aVWe're using games to escape real-world suffering \u2014
p335
aVwe're using games to get away
p336
aVfrom everything that's broken in the real environment,
p337
aVeverything that's not satisfying about real life,
p338
aVand we're getting what we need from games.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut it doesn't have to end there.
p341
aVThis is really exciting.
p342
aVAccording to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better,
p343
aVso the king decided they would play one final dice game.
p344
aVThey divided the entire kingdom in half.
p345
aVThey played one dice game,
p346
aVand the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.
p347
aVThey would leave Lydia,
p348
aVand they would go out in search of a new place to live,
p349
aVleaving behind just enough people
p350
aVto survive on the resources that were available,
p351
aVand hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow, this sounds crazy, right?
p354
aVBut recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans,
p355
aVwho then led to the Roman Empire,
p356
aVactually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.
p357
aVAnd so, recently, scientists have suggested
p358
aVthat Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.
p359
aVAnd geologists have found evidence of a global cooling
p360
aVthat lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine.
p361
aVSo this crazy story might be true.
p362
aVThey might have actually saved their culture by playing games,
p363
aVescaping to games for 18 years,
p364
aVand then been so inspired,
p365
aVand knew so much about how to come together with games,
p366
aVthat they actually saved the entire civilization that way.
p367
aa(lp368
VOkay, we can do that.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VWe've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
p373
aVThat was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series.
p374
aVThat was 16 years ago.
p375
aVThey played dice games for 18 years,
p376
aVwe've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.
p377
aVI say we are ready for our own epic game.
p378
aVNow, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world,
p379
aVso that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.
p380
aVLet's get half of us to agree
p381
aVto spend an hour a day playing games,
p382
aVuntil we solve real-world problems.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow, I know you're asking,
p385
aV"How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?"
p386
aVWell, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years,
p387
aVat the Institute for the Future.
p388
aVWe have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,
p389
aVand it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.
p390
aVWe do not want to try to predict the future.
p391
aVWhat we want to do is make the future.
p392
aVWe want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,
p393
aVand then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.
p394
aVWe want to imagine epic wins,
p395
aVand then give people the means to achieve the epic win.
p396
aa(lp397
VI'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made
p398
aVthat are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins
p399
aVin their own futures.
p400
aVThis is World Without Oil.
p401
aVWe made this game in 2007.
p402
aVThis is an online game
p403
aVin which you try to survive an oil shortage.
p404
aVThe oil shortage is fictional,
p405
aVbut we put enough online content out there
p406
aVfor you to believe that it's real,
p407
aVand to live your real life as if we've run out of oil.
p408
aVSo when you come to the game,
p409
aVyou sign up, tell us where you live,
p410
aVand then we give you real-time news videos,
p411
aVdata feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs,
p412
aVwhat's not available, how food supply is being affected,
p413
aVhow transportation is being affected,
p414
aVif schools are closed, if there's rioting,
p415
aVand you have to figure out how you would live your real life
p416
aVas if this were true.
p417
aVAnd then we ask you to blog about it,
p418
aVto post videos, to post photos.
p419
aa(lp420
VWe piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,
p421
aVand we've tracked them for the three years since.
p422
aVAnd I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
p423
aVNobody wants to change how they live,
p424
aVjust because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
p425
aVBut if you immerse them in an epic adventure
p426
aVand tell them, "We've run out of oil.
p427
aVThis is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
p428
aVChallenge yourself to see how you would survive,"
p429
aVmost of our players have kept up the habits
p430
aVthat they learned in this game.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo for the next world-saving game,
p433
aVwe decided to aim higher \u2014 bigger problem than just peak oil.
p434
aVWe did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future.
p435
aVAnd the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated
p436
aVthat humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
p437
aVThis supercomputer was called
p438
aVthe Global Extinction Awareness System, of course.
p439
aVWe asked people to come online \u2014
p440
aValmost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
p441
aVYou know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team \u2014
p442
aVyou've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,
p443
aVand they all have something to do to save the world.
p444
aa(lp445
V(Laughter)
p446
aa(lp447
VBut in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team,
p448
aVwe said, "Everybody's on the dream team,
p449
aVand it's your job to invent the future of energy,
p450
aVthe future of food, the future of health,
p451
aVthe future of security and the future of the social safety net."
p452
aVWe had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.
p453
aVThey came up with 500 insanely creative solutions
p454
aVthat you can go online, Google "Superstruct," and see.
p455
aa(lp456
VSo, finally, the last game,
p457
aVwe're launching it March 3rd.
p458
aVThis is a game done with the World Bank Institute.
p459
aVIf you complete the game,
p460
aVyou will be certified by the World Bank Institute
p461
aVas a Social Innovator, class of 2010.
p462
aVWorking with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa,
p463
aVand we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.
p464
aVWe've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up
p465
aVin skills like local insight, knowledge networking,
p466
aVsustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
p467
aVI would like to invite all of you
p468
aVto please share this game with young people,
p469
aVanywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,
p470
aVwho might benefit from coming together
p471
aVto try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world.
p472
aa(lp473
VSo, I'm going to wrap up now.
p474
aVI want to ask a question.
p475
aVWhat do you think happens next?
p476
aVWe've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games
p477
aVthat are kind of pilots of what we might do,
p478
aVbut none of them have saved the real world yet.
p479
aVWell I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource
p480
aVthat we can use to do real-world work,
p481
aVthat games are a powerful platform for change.
p482
aVWe have all these amazing superpowers:
p483
aVblissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric,
p484
aVthis feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
p485
aa(lp486
VI really hope that we can come together to play games that matter,
p487
aVto survive on this planet for another century.
p488
aVThat's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.
p489
aVWhen I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure:
p490
aVthat we can make any future we can imagine,
p491
aVand we can play any games we want, so I say:
p492
aVLet the world-changing games begin.
