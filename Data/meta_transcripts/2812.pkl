VSo, I love making tools and sharing them with people.
p4
aVI remember as a child,
p5
aVmy first tool I built was actually a microscope
p6
aVthat I built by stealing lenses from my brother's eyeglasses.
p7
aVHe wasn't that thrilled.
p8
aVBut, you know, maybe because of that moment,
p9
aV30 years later,
p10
aVI'm still making microscopes.
p11
aVAnd the reason I built these tools is for moments like this.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Video) Girl: I have black things in my hair \u2014
p14
aa(lp15
VManu Prakash: This is a school in the Bay Area.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Video) MP: The living world far supersedes our imagination
p18
aVof how things actually work.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Video) Boy: Oh my God!
p21
aa(lp22
VMP: Right \u2014 oh my God!
p23
aVI hadn't realized this would be such a universal phrase.
p24
aa(lp25
VOver the last two years,
p26
aVin my lab,
p27
aVwe built 50,000 Foldscopes
p28
aVand shipped them to 130 countries in the world,
p29
aVat no cost to the kids we sent them to.
p30
aVThis year alone,
p31
aVwith the support of our community,
p32
aVwe are planning to ship a million microscopes
p33
aVto kids around the world.
p34
aVWhat does that do?
p35
aVIt creates an inspiring community of people around the world,
p36
aVlearning and teaching each other,
p37
aVfrom Kenya to Kampala to Kathmandu to Kansas.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd one of the phenomenal things that I love about this
p40
aVis the sense of community.
p41
aVThere's a kid in Nicaragua
p42
aVteaching others how to identify mosquito species that carry dengue
p43
aVby looking at the larva under a microscope.
p44
aVThere's a pharmacologist who came up with a new way
p45
aVto detect fake drugs anywhere.
p46
aVThere is a girl who wondered:
p47
aV"How does glitter actually work?"
p48
aVand discovered the physics of crystalline formation in glitter.
p49
aVThere is an Argentinian doctor
p50
aVwho's trying to do field cervical cancer screening with this tool.
p51
aVAnd yours very truly found a species of flea
p52
aVthat was dug inside my heel in my foot one centimeter deep.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, you might think of these as anomalies.
p55
aVBut there is a method to this madness.
p56
aVI call this "frugal science" \u2014
p57
aVthe idea of sharing the experience of science,
p58
aVand not just the information.
p59
aVTo remind you:
p60
aVthere are a billion people on this planet
p61
aVwho live with absolutely no infrastructure:
p62
aVno roads,
p63
aVno electricity
p64
aVand thus, no health care.
p65
aVAlso, there a billion kids on this planet that live in poverty.
p66
aVHow are we supposed to inspire them
p67
aVfor the next generation of solution makers?
p68
aVThere are health care workers that we put on the line
p69
aVto fight infectious diseases,
p70
aVto protect us with absolutely bare-minimum tools and resources.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo as a lab at Stanford,
p73
aVI think of this from a context of frugal science
p74
aVand building solutions for these communities.
p75
aVOften we think about being able to do diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.
p76
aVI'll tell you two examples today of new tools.
p77
aVOne of them starts in Uganda.
p78
aVIn 2013,
p79
aVon a field trip to detect schistosomiasis with Foldscopes,
p80
aVI made a minor observation.
p81
aVIn a clinic,
p82
aVin a far, remote area,
p83
aVI saw a centrifuge being used as a doorstop.
p84
aVI mean \u2014 quite literally, the doorstop.
p85
aVAnd I asked them and they said,
p86
aV"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,
p87
aVso this piece of junk is good as a doorstop."
p88
aVCentrifuges, for some of you who don't know,
p89
aVare the pinnacle tool to be able to do sample processing.
p90
aVYou separate components of blood or body fluids
p91
aVto be able to detect and identify pathogens.
p92
aVBut centrifuges are bulky, expensive \u2014
p93
aVcost around 1,000 dollars \u2014
p94
aVand really hard to carry out in the field.
p95
aVAnd of course,
p96
aVthey don't work without power.
p97
aVSound familiar?
p98
aVSo we started thinking about solving this problem,
p99
aVand I came back \u2014
p100
aVkept thinking about toys.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow ...
p103
aVI have a few with me here.
p104
aVI first started with yo-yos ...
p105
aVand I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.
p106
aVBecause these objects spin,
p107
aVwe wondered,
p108
aVcould we actually use the physics of these objects
p109
aVto be able to build centrifuges?
p110
aVThis was possibly the worst throw I could make.
p111
aVBut you might start realizing,
p112
aVif you start exploring the space of toys \u2014
p113
aVwe tried these spinning tops,
p114
aVand then in the lab,
p115
aVwe stumbled upon this wonder.
p116
aa(lp117
VIt's the whirligig, or a buzzer, or a rundle.
p118
aVA couple of strings and a little disk,
p119
aVand if I push, it spins.
p120
aVHow many of you have played with this as a kid?
p121
aVThis is called a button-on-a-string.
p122
aVOK, maybe 50 percent of you.
p123
aVWhat you didn't realize \u2014
p124
aVthat this little object
p125
aVis the oldest toy in the history of mankind ...
p126
aV5,000 years ago.
p127
aVWe have found relics of this object hidden around on our planet.
p128
aVNow the irony is,
p129
aVwe actually don't understand how this little thing works.
p130
aVThat's when I get excited.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo we got back to work,
p133
aVwrote down a couple of equations.
p134
aVIf you take the input torque that you put in,
p135
aVyou take the drag on this disc,
p136
aVand the twist drag on these strings,
p137
aVyou should be able to mathematically solve this.
p138
aVThis is not the only equation in my talk.
p139
aVTen pages of math later,
p140
aVwe could actually write down the complete analytical solution
p141
aVfor this dynamic system.
p142
aVAnd out comes what we call "Paperfuge."
p143
aVThat's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,
p144
aVwho's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.
p145
aVAnd to the left, you see all the centrifuges
p146
aVthat we're trying to replace.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis little object that you see right here
p149
aVis a disc, a couple of strings and a handle.
p150
aVAnd when I spin
p151
aVand I push,
p152
aVit starts to spin.
p153
aVNow, when you realize,
p154
aVwhen you do the math,
p155
aVwhen we calculate the rpm for this object,
p156
aVmathematically, we should be able to go all the way to a million rpm.
p157
aVNow, there is a little twist in human anatomy,
p158
aVbecause the resonant frequency of this object is about 10 hertz,
p159
aVand if you've ever played the piano,
p160
aVyou can't go higher than two or three hertz.
p161
aVThe maximum speed we've been able to achieve with this object
p162
aVis not 10,000 rpm,
p163
aVnot 50,000 rpm \u2014
p164
aV120,000 rpm.
p165
aVThat's equal to 30,000 g-forces.
p166
aVIf I was to stick you right here and have it spin,
p167
aVyou would think about the types of forces you would experience.
p168
aa(lp169
VOne of the factors of a tool like this
p170
aVis to be able to do diagnosis with this.
p171
aVSo, I'm going to do a quick demo here, where \u2014
p172
aVthis is a moment where I'm going to make a little finger prick,
p173
aVand a tiny drop of blood is going to come out.
p174
aVIf you don't like blood, you don't have to look at it.
p175
aVHere is a little lancet.
p176
aVThese lancets are available everywhere,
p177
aVcompletely passive.
p178
aVAnd if I've had breakfast today ...
p179
aVThat didn't hurt at all.
p180
aVOK, I take a little capillary with a drop of blood \u2014
p181
aVnow this drop of blood has answers,
p182
aVthat's why I'm interested in it.
p183
aVIt might actually tell me whether I have malaria right now or not.
p184
aVI take a little capillary,
p185
aVand you see it starts wicking in.
p186
aVI'm going to draw a little more blood.
p187
aVAnd that's good enough for right now.
p188
aVNow, I just seal this capillary by putting it in clay.
p189
aVAnd now that's sealed the sample.
p190
aa(lp191
VWe're going to take the sample,
p192
aVmount it on Paperfuge.
p193
aVA little piece of tape to make a sealed cavity.
p194
aVSo now the sample is completely enclosed.
p195
aVAnd we are ready for a spin.
p196
aVI'm pushing and pulling with this object.
p197
aVI'm going to load this up ...
p198
aVAnd you see the object starts spinning.
p199
aVUnlike a regular centrifuge,
p200
aVthis is a counter-rotating centrifuge.
p201
aVIt goes back and forth, back and forth ...
p202
aVAnd now I'm charging it up,
p203
aVand you see it builds momentum.
p204
aVAnd now \u2014 I don't know if you can hear this \u2014
p205
aV30 seconds of this,
p206
aVand I should be able to separate all the blood cells with the plasma.
p207
aVAnd the ratio of those blood  cells to plasma \u2014
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VAlready, if you see right here,
p212
aVif you focus on this,
p213
aVyou should be able to see a separated volume
p214
aVof blood and plasma.
p215
aVAnd the ratio of that actually tells me whether I might be anemic.
p216
aa(lp217
VOne of the aspects of this is, we build many types of Paperfuges.
p218
aVThis one allows us to identify malaria parasites
p219
aVby running them for a little longer,
p220
aVand we can identify malaria parasites that are in the blood
p221
aVthat we can separate out and detect with something like a centrifuge.
p222
aVAnother version of this allows me to separate nucleic acids
p223
aVto be able to do nucleic acid tests out in the field itself.
p224
aVHere is another version that allows me to separate bulk samples,
p225
aVand then, finally,
p226
aVsomething new that we've been working on
p227
aVto be able to implement the entire multiplex test on an object like this.
p228
aVSo where you do the sample preparation and the chemistry in the same object.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow ...
p231
aVthis is all good,
p232
aVbut when you start thinking about this,
p233
aVyou have to share these tools with people.
p234
aVAnd one of the things we did is \u2014 we just got back from Madagascar;
p235
aVthis is what clinical trials for malaria look like \u2014
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VYou can do this while having coffee.
p240
aVBut most importantly,
p241
aVthis is a village six hours from any road.
p242
aVWe are in a room with one of the senior members of the community
p243
aVand a health care worker.
p244
aVIt really is this portion of the work that excites me the most \u2014
p245
aVthat smile,
p246
aVto be able to share simple but powerful tools with people around the world.
p247
aVNow, I forgot to tell you this,
p248
aVthat all of that cost me 20 cents to make.
p249
aa(lp250
VOK, in the negative time I have left,
p251
aVI'll tell you about the most recent \u2014
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
Vinvention from our lab.
p256
aVIt's called Abuzz \u2014
p257
aVthe idea that all of you could help us fight mosquitoes;
p258
aVyou could all help us track our enemies.
p259
aVThese are enemies because they cause malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.
p260
aVBut the challenge is that we actually don't know where our enemies are.
p261
aVThe world map for where mosquitoes are is missing.
p262
aVSo we started thinking about this.
p263
aVThere are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,
p264
aVand they're all very similar.
p265
aVSome of them are so identical
p266
aVthat even an entomologist cannot identify them under a microscope.
p267
aa(lp268
VBut they have an Achilles' heel.
p269
aVThis is what mosquitoes flirting with each other looks like.
p270
aVThat's a male chasing a female.
p271
aVThey're actually talking to each other with their wingbeat frequencies.
p272
aV(Buzzing sound)
p273
aVAnd thus, they have a signature.
p274
aVWe realized that using a regular phone,
p275
aVa $5-10 flip phone \u2014
p276
aVhow many remember what this object is?
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VWe can record these acoustic signatures from mosquitoes.
p281
aVI'll tell you exactly how to do this.
p282
aa(lp283
VI caught some mosquitoes outside.
p284
aVUnlike Bill [Gates], I'm not going to release them.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VBut I will tell you how to record from this.
p289
aVAll you do is tap them and they fly.
p290
aVYou can first test \u2014
p291
aVI can actually hear that.
p292
aVAnd you bring your phone, which has microphones \u2014
p293
aVit turns out the mics are so damn good already,
p294
aVeven on regular phones,
p295
aVthat you can pick up this near-field signature.
p296
aVAnd since I'm out of time,
p297
aVlet me just play the recording that I made a day ago.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Mosquitoes buzz)
p300
aa(lp301
VThis is all the charming sound that you heard before
p302
aVthat you all love.
p303
aVOne of the contexts of this
p304
aVis that being able to do this with a regular cell phone
p305
aVallows us to map mosquito species.
p306
aVUsing a flip phone,
p307
aVwe mapped one of the largest acoustic databases
p308
aVwith 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes that carry human pathogens.
p309
aVAnd from this and machine learning,
p310
aVanybody who uploads this data,
p311
aVwe can identify and tell the probability
p312
aVof what species of mosquitoes you're actually working with.
p313
aVWe call this Abuzz, and if any of you want to sign up,
p314
aVjust go to the website.
p315
aa(lp316
VLet me close with something
p317
aVthat's very important and dear to my heart.
p318
aVOne of the challenges of today is we have terrible problems.
p319
aVWe have a billion people with absolutely no health care,
p320
aVclimate change, biodiversity loss,
p321
aVon and on and on.
p322
aVAnd we hope that science is going to provide the answer.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut before you leave this theatre today,
p325
aVI want you to promise one thing.
p326
aVWe're going to make science accessible \u2014
p327
aVnot just to the people who can afford it,
p328
aVbut a billion others who can't.
p329
aVLet's make science and scientific literacy a human right.
p330
aVThe moment that you pass the tingling feeling of making a discovery
p331
aVto another child,
p332
aVyou're enabling them to be the next group of people
p333
aVwho will actually solve these problems.
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
