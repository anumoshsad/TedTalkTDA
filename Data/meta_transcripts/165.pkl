VSo, where are the robots?
p4
aVWe've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.
p5
aVVery soon they'll be doing everything for us.
p6
aVThey'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.
p7
aVMeanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,
p8
aVbut we don't have any robots.
p9
aVSo what can we do about that? What can we say?
p10
aVSo I want to give a little bit of a different perspective
p11
aVof how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
p12
aVAnd this is an x-ray picture
p13
aVof a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that \u2014
p14
aVwhat was true then is certainly true today.
p15
aVWe can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.
p16
aVWe can make the circuitry of the right computational power,
p17
aVbut we can't actually put them together to make something
p18
aVthat will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo let's try to look at it from a different perspective.
p21
aVLet's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.
p22
aVLet's see what evolution can do for us.
p23
aVSo we threw in \u2014 we created a primordial soup
p24
aVwith lots of pieces of robots \u2014 with bars, with motors, with neurons.
p25
aVPut them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,
p26
aVunder mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
p27
aVA very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo if you look, you can see a lot of different machines
p30
aVcome out of this. They all move around.
p31
aVThey all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,
p32
aVthat we actually made a couple of these things,
p33
aVand they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,
p34
aVbut they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:
p35
aa(lp36
Vfor moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,
p37
aVbut we can also do that on a real machine.
p38
aVHere's a physical robot that we actually
p39
aVhave a population of brains,
p40
aVcompeting, or evolving on the machine.
p41
aVIt's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,
p42
aVand they get rewarded for how fast or how far
p43
aVthey can make the machine move forward.
p44
aVAnd you can see these robots are not ready
p45
aVto take over the world yet, but
p46
aVthey gradually learn how to move forward,
p47
aVand they do this autonomously.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo in these two examples, we had basically
p50
aVmachines that learned how to walk in simulation,
p51
aVand also machines that learned how to walk in reality.
p52
aVBut I want to show you a different approach,
p53
aVand this is this robot over here, which has four legs.
p54
aVIt has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
p55
aVIt has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine
p56
aVwhich way it's tilting.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
p59
aVYou look at it and you see it has four legs,
p60
aVthe machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,
p61
aVit doesn't have any idea what it looks like,
p62
aVbut it's going to try to find that out.
p63
aVInitially, it does some random motion,
p64
aVand then it tries to figure out what it might look like.
p65
aVAnd you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,
p66
aVa lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship
p67
aVbetween actuation and sensing. It then tries to do
p68
aVa second action that creates the most disagreement
p69
aVamong predictions of these alternative models,
p70
aVlike a scientist in a lab. Then it does that
p71
aVand tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much
p74
aVfigured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,
p75
aVit can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.
p76
aVSo what you're seeing here are a couple of machines \u2014
p77
aVa pattern of locomotion.
p78
aVWe were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,
p79
aVbut instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut when you look at that, you have to remember
p82
aVthat this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,
p83
aVnor did it have a model of itself.
p84
aVIt kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,
p85
aVand then actually tried that out.
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, we'll move forward to a different idea.
p89
aVSo that was what happened when we had a couple of \u2014
p90
aVthat's what happened when you had a couple of \u2014 OK, OK, OK \u2014
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aV\u2014 they don't like each other. So
p93
aVthere's a different robot.
p94
aVThat's what happened when the robots actually
p95
aVare rewarded for doing something.
p96
aVWhat happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.
p99
aVThe cube can swivel, or flip on its side,
p100
aVand we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup \u2014
p101
aVthis is in simulation \u2014and don't reward them for anything,
p102
aVwe just let them flip. We pump energy into this
p103
aVand see what happens in a couple of mutations.
p104
aVSo, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.
p105
aVBut after a very short while, you can see these blue things
p106
aVon the right there begin to take over.
p107
aa(lp108
VThey begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,
p109
aVthe intrinsic reward is self-replication.
p110
aVAnd we've actually built a couple of these,
p111
aVand this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.
p112
aVIt's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually
p113
aVcarrying out some of its replication process.
p114
aVSo you're feeding it with more material \u2014 cubes in this case \u2014
p115
aVand more energy, and it can make another robot.
p116
aVSo of course, this is a very crude machine,
p117
aVbut we're working on a micro-scale version of these,
p118
aVand hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.
p119
aa(lp120
VOK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course
p121
aVnot very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something
p122
aVabout how we can build better robots,
p123
aVand perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.
p124
aVAnd one of the things that I think is important
p125
aVis that we have to get away from this idea
p126
aVof designing the machines manually,
p127
aVbut actually let them evolve and learn, like children,
p128
aVand perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.
