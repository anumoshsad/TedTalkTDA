VI want you all to think
p4
aVabout the third word that was ever said about you \u2014
p5
aVor, if you were delivering,
p6
aVabout the person you were delivering.
p7
aVAnd you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud.
p8
aVIt was \u2014 the first two were, "It's a ..."
p9
aa(lp10
VAudience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, it shows you that \u2014
p15
aVI also deal with issues where there's not certainty
p16
aVof whether it's a girl or a boy,
p17
aVso the mixed answer was very appropriate.
p18
aa(lp19
VOf course, now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound,
p20
aVunless the prospective parents choose to be surprised,
p21
aVlike we all were.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement
p24
aVon the third word,
p25
aVbecause the third word
p26
aVis a description of your sex.
p27
aVAnd by that I mean,
p28
aVmade by a description of your genitals.
p29
aVNow, as a pediatric endocrinologist,
p30
aVI used to be very, very involved and still somewhat am, in cases
p31
aVin which there are mismatches in the externals
p32
aVor between the externals and the internals,
p33
aVand we literally have to figure out
p34
aVwhat is the description of your sex.
p35
aVBut there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth
p36
aVthat would define you.
p37
aVAnd when I talk about definition,
p38
aVI'm talking about your sexual orientation.
p39
aVWe don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!"
p40
aV"A lesbian girl!"
p41
aVThose situations don't really define themselves
p42
aVmore until the second decade of life.
p43
aVNor do they define your gender,
p44
aVwhich, as different from your anatomic sex,
p45
aVdescribes your self-concept:
p46
aa(lp47
VDo you see yourself as a male or female,
p48
aVor somewhere in the spectrum in between?
p49
aVThat sometimes shows up
p50
aVin the first decade of life,
p51
aVbut it can be very confusing for parents,
p52
aVbecause it is quite normative for children
p53
aVto act in a cross-gender play and way,
p54
aVand, in fact, there are studies that show
p55
aVthat even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion
p56
aVwill not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender
p57
aVat the time when puberty begins.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut, at the time that puberty begins \u2014
p60
aVthat means between about age 10 to 12 in girls, 12 to 14 in boys \u2014
p61
aVwith breast budding,
p62
aVor two to three times' increase in the gonads
p63
aVin the case of genetic males,
p64
aVby that particular point,
p65
aVthe child who says they are in the absolute wrong body
p66
aVis almost certain to be transgender
p67
aVand is extremely unlikely to change those feelings,
p68
aVno matter how anybody tries reparative therapy
p69
aVor any other noxious things.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, this is relatively rare,
p72
aVso I had relatively little personal experience with this.
p73
aVAnd my experience was more typical,
p74
aVonly because I had an adolescent practice.
p75
aVAnd I saw someone age 24,
p76
aVgenetically female, went through Harvard with three male roommates
p77
aVwho knew the whole story,
p78
aVa registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name,
p79
aVand came to me after graduating,
p80
aVsaying, "Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology."
p81
aVAnd indeed, I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads.
p82
aVThis wasn't rocket science.
p83
aVBut I made a deal with him:
p84
aV"I'll treat you if you teach me."
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd so he did.
p87
aVAnd what an education I got
p88
aVfrom taking care of all the members of his support group.
p89
aVAnd then I got really confused,
p90
aVbecause I thought it was relatively easy at that age
p91
aVto just give people the hormones
p92
aVof the gender in which they were affirming.
p93
aVBut then my patient married,
p94
aVand he married a woman who had been born as a male,
p95
aVhad married as a male, had two children,
p96
aVthen went through a transition into female.
p97
aVAnd now this delightful female
p98
aVwas attached to my male patient \u2014 in fact, got legally married,
p99
aVbecause they showed up as a man and a woman, and who knew, right?
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I was confused \u2014
p104
aV"Does this make so-and-so gay?
p105
aVDoes this make so-and-so straight?"
p106
aVI was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity.
p107
aVAnd my patient said to me,
p108
aV"Look, look, look.
p109
aVIf you just think of the following, you'll get it right:
p110
aVSexual orientation is who you go to bed with.
p111
aVGender identity is who you go to bed as."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd I subsequently learned from the many adults \u2014
p116
aVI took care of about 200 adults \u2014
p117
aVI learned from them
p118
aVthat if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room,
p119
aVI would never be able to guess better than chance,
p120
aVwhether they were gay, straight, bi or asexual
p121
aVin their affirmed gender.
p122
aVIn other words,
p123
aVone thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
p124
aVAnd the data show it.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, as I took care of the 200 adults,
p127
aVI found it extremely painful.
p128
aVThese people \u2014 many of them \u2014
p129
aVhad to give up so much of their lives.
p130
aVSometimes their parents would reject them,
p131
aVsiblings, their own children,
p132
aVand then their divorcing spouse
p133
aVwould forbid them from seeing their children.
p134
aVIt was so awful,
p135
aVbut why did they do it at 40 and 50?
p136
aVBecause they felt they had to affirm themselves
p137
aVbefore they would kill themselves.
p138
aVAnd indeed, the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people
p139
aVis among the highest in the world.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, what to do?
p142
aVI was intrigued, in going to a conference in Holland,
p143
aVwhere they are experts in this,
p144
aVand saw the most remarkable thing.
p145
aVThey were treating young adolescents
p146
aVafter giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender,
p147
aVand they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want.
p148
aVBecause basically, kids look about the same,
p149
aVeach sex, until they go through puberty,
p150
aVat which point, if you feel you're in the wrong sex,
p151
aVyou feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.
p152
aVThe fantasy that you had that your body will change
p153
aVto be who you want it to be, with puberty,
p154
aVactually is nullified by the puberty you get.
p155
aVAnd they fall apart.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo that's why putting the puberty on hold \u2014 why on hold?
p158
aVYou can't just give them the opposite hormones that young.
p159
aVThey'll end up stunted in growth,
p160
aVand you think you can have a meaningful conversation
p161
aVabout the fertility effects of such treatment
p162
aVwith a 10-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy?
p163
aVSo this buys time in the diagnostic process
p164
aVfor four or five years,
p165
aVso that they can work it out.
p166
aVThey can have more and more testing,
p167
aVthey can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them.
p168
aVAnd then, in a program they call 12-16-18,
p169
aVaround age 12 is when they give the blocking hormones,
p170
aVand then at age 16, with retesting,
p171
aVthey re-qualify to receive \u2014
p172
aVnow remember, the blocking hormones are reversible,
p173
aVbut when you give the hormones of the opposite sex,
p174
aVyou now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change,
p175
aVdepending on what you're using,
p176
aVand those effects are permanent,
p177
aVor require surgery to remove,
p178
aVor electrolysis,
p179
aVand you can never really affect the voice.
p180
aVSo this is serious, and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then at 18, they're eligible for surgery.
p183
aVAnd while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally,
p184
aVthe male-to-female surgery has fooled gynecologists.
p185
aVThat's how good it can be.
p186
aVSo I looked at how the patients were doing,
p187
aVand I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else,
p188
aVexcept they were pubertally delayed.
p189
aVBut once they gave them the hormones
p190
aVconsistent with the gender they affirm,
p191
aVthey look beautiful.
p192
aVThey look normal.
p193
aVThey had normal heights.
p194
aVYou would never be able to pick them out in a crowd.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo at that point, I decided I'm going to do this.
p197
aVThis is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in,
p198
aVbecause, in fact, if you're going to deal with it in kids aged 10 to 14,
p199
aVthat's pediatric endocrinology.
p200
aVSo I brought some kids in,
p201
aVand this now became the standard of care,
p202
aVand the [Boston] Children's Hospital was behind it.
p203
aVBy my showing them the kids before and after,
p204
aVpeople who never got treated and people who wished to be treated,
p205
aVand pictures of the Dutch \u2014
p206
aVthey came to me and said,
p207
aV"You've got to do something for these kids."
p208
aVWell, where were these kids before?
p209
aVThey were out there suffering, is where they were.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo we started a program in 2007.
p212
aVIt became the first program of its kind \u2014
p213
aVbut it's really of the Dutch kind \u2014
p214
aVin North America.
p215
aVAnd since then, we have 160 patients.
p216
aVDid they come from Afghanistan? No.
p217
aV75 percent of them came from within 150 miles of Boston.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd some came from England.
p220
aVJackie had been abused in the Midlands, in England.
p221
aVShe's 12 years old there,
p222
aVshe was living as a girl,
p223
aVbut she was being beaten up.
p224
aVIt was a horror show, they had to homeschool her.
p225
aVAnd the reason the British were coming
p226
aVwas because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16,
p227
aVwhich means they were consigning them to an adult body
p228
aVno matter what happened,
p229
aVeven if they tested them well.
p230
aVJackie, on top of it, was, by virtue of skeletal markings,
p231
aVdestined to be six feet five.
p232
aVAnd yet, she had just begun a male puberty.
p233
aa(lp234
VWell, I did something a little bit innovative,
p235
aVbecause I do know hormones,
p236
aVand that estrogen is much more potent
p237
aVin closing epiphyses, the growth plates,
p238
aVand stopping growth, than testosterone is.
p239
aVSo we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone,
p240
aVbut we added estrogen, not at 16, but at 13.
p241
aVAnd so here she is at 16, on the left.
p242
aVAnd on her 16th birthday, she went to Thailand,
p243
aVwhere they would do a genital plastic surgery.
p244
aVThey will do it at 18 now.
p245
aVAnd she ended up 5'11".
p246
aVBut more than that, she has normal breast size,
p247
aVbecause by blocking testosterone,
p248
aVevery one of our patients has normal breast size
p249
aVif they get to us at the appropriate age,
p250
aVnot too late.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd on the far right, there she is.
p253
aVShe went public \u2014 semifinalist in the Miss England competition.
p254
aVThe judges debated as to, can they do this?
p255
aVAnd one of them quipped, I'm told,
p256
aV"But she has more natural self than half the other contestants."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd some of them have been rearranged a little bit,
p261
aVbut it's all her DNA.
p262
aVAnd she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.
p263
aVAnd she was offered contracts as a model,
p264
aVat which point she teased me, when she said,
p265
aV"You know, I might have had a better chance as a model
p266
aVif you'd made me six feet one."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VGo figure.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo this picture, I think, says it all.
p273
aVIt really says it all.
p274
aVThese are Nicole and brother Jonas,
p275
aVidentical twin boys,
p276
aVand proven to be identical.
p277
aVNicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three.
p278
aVAt age seven, they changed her name,
p279
aVand came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty.
p280
aVNow you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14,
p281
aVthat male puberty is early in this family,
p282
aVbecause he looks more like a 16-year-old.
p283
aVBut it makes the point all the more,
p284
aVof why you have to be conscious of where the patient is.
p285
aVNicole is on pubertal blockade in here,
p286
aVand Jonas is just going \u2014 biologic control.
p287
aVThis is what Nicole would look like
p288
aVif we weren't doing what we were doing.
p289
aVHe's got a prominent Adam's apple.
p290
aVHe's got angular bones to the face, a mustache,
p291
aVand you can see there's a height difference,
p292
aVbecause he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get.
p293
aVNow Nicole is on estrogen.
p294
aVShe has a bit of a form to her.
p295
aa(lp296
VThis family went to the White House last spring,
p297
aVbecause of their work in overturning an anti-discrimination \u2014
p298
aVthere was a bill that would block
p299
aVthe right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms,
p300
aVand it looked like the bill was going to pass,
p301
aVand that would have been a problem,
p302
aVbut Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine
p303
aVand said, "I can do this.
p304
aVIf they see me, they'll understand
p305
aVwhy I'm no threat in the ladies' room,
p306
aVbut I can be threatened in the men's room."
p307
aVAnd then they finally got it.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo where do we go from here?
p310
aVWell, we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination.
p311
aVThere are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law
p312
aVagainst discrimination in housing,
p313
aVemployment, public accommodation \u2014
p314
aVonly 17 states, and five of them are in New England.
p315
aVWe need less expensive drugs.
p316
aVThey cost a fortune.
p317
aVAnd we need to get this condition out of the DSM.
p318
aVIt is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian,
p319
aVand that went out the window in 1973,
p320
aVand the whole world changed.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd this isn't going to break anybody's budget.
p323
aVThis is not that common.
p324
aVBut the risks of not doing anything for them
p325
aVnot only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide,
p326
aVbut it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society.
p327
