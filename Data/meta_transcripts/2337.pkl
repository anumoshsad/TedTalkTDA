(lp2
(lp3
V(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan. In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.
p4
aa(lp5
V(English) I was born in a middle class family.
p6
aVMy father was five years old when he lost his father,
p7
aVbut by the time I was born,
p8
aVhe was already a businessman.
p9
aVBut it didn't make a difference to him
p10
aVif his children were going to be a boy or a girl:
p11
aVthey were going to go to school.
p12
aVSo I guess I was the lucky one.
p13
aa(lp14
VMy mother had 16 pregnancies.
p15
aVFrom 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.
p16
aVYou can imagine as a child what I went through.
p17
aVDay to day, I watched women
p18
aVbeing carried to a graveyard,
p19
aVor watched children going to a graveyard.
p20
aVAt that time, when I finished my high school,
p21
aVI really wanted to be a doctor.
p22
aVI wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
p23
aVSo I completed my education,
p24
aVbut I wanted to go to university.
p25
aVUnfortunately, in my country, there wasn't a dormitory for girls,
p26
aVso I was accepted in medical school, but I could not go there.
p27
aVSo as a result, my father sent me to America.
p28
aa(lp29
VI came to America.
p30
aVI completed my education.
p31
aVWhile I was completing my education,
p32
aVmy country was invaded by Russia.
p33
aVAnd do you know that at the time I was completing my education,
p34
aVI didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country.
p35
aVThere were months, years, I didn't know about it.
p36
aVMy family was in a refugee camp.
p37
aVSo as soon as I completed my education,
p38
aVI brought my family to America.
p39
aVI wanted them to be safe.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut where was my heart?
p42
aVMy heart was in Afghanistan.
p43
aVDay after day, when I listened to the news,
p44
aVwhen I followed what was going on with my country,
p45
aVmy heart was breaking up.
p46
aVI really wanted to go back to my country,
p47
aVbut at the same time I knew I could not go there,
p48
aVbecause there was no place for me.
p49
aVI had a good job.
p50
aVI was a professor at a university.
p51
aVI earned good money.
p52
aVI had a good life.
p53
aVMy family was here.
p54
aVI could live with them.
p55
aVBut I wasn't happy.
p56
aVI wanted to go back home.
p57
aVSo I went to the refugee camp.
p58
aVAnd when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan,
p59
aVthere were 7.5 million refugees.
p60
aV7.5 million refugees.
p61
aVAbout 90 percent of them were women and children.
p62
aVMost of the men have been killed or they were in war.
p63
aVAnd you know, in the refugee camp,
p64
aVwhen I went day-to-day to do a survey,
p65
aVI found things you never could imagine.
p66
aVI saw a widow with five to eight children
p67
aVsitting there and weeping
p68
aVand not knowing what to do.
p69
aVI saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere,
p70
aVno education, no entertainment, no place to even live.
p71
aVI saw young men that had lost their father and their home,
p72
aVand they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy \u2014
p73
aVbeing the head of the household,
p74
aVtrying to protect their sister and their mother and their children.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo it was a very devastating situation.
p77
aVMy heart was beating for my people,
p78
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p79
aVAt that moment, we talk about momentum.
p80
aVAt that moment, I felt, what can I do for these people?
p81
aVHow could I help these people?
p82
aVI am one individual. What can I do for them?
p83
aa(lp84
VBut at that moment, I knew
p85
aVthat education changed my life.
p86
aVIt transformed me. It gave me status.
p87
aVIt gave me confidence. It gave me a career.
p88
aVIt helped me to support my family,
p89
aVto bring my family to another country,
p90
aVto be safe.
p91
aVAnd I knew that at that moment
p92
aVthat what I should give to my people is education and health,
p93
aVand that's what I went after.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut do you think it was easy?
p96
aVNo, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely.
p97
aVAnd also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,
p98
aVpeople were not trusting anyone.
p99
aVIt was very hard to come and say, "I want to do this."
p100
aVWho am I?
p101
aVSomebody who comes from the United States.
p102
aVSomebody who got educated here.
p103
aVDid they trust me? Of course not.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I really needed to build the trust in this community.
p106
aVHow am I going to do that?
p107
aVI went and surveyed and looked and looked.
p108
aVI asked.
p109
aVFinally, I found one man.
p110
aVHe was 80 years old.
p111
aVHe was a mullah.
p112
aVI went to his tent in the camp,
p113
aVand I asked him,
p114
aV"I want to make you a teacher."
p115
aVAnd he looked at me,
p116
aVand he said, "Crazy woman,
p117
aVcrazy woman, how do you think I can be a teacher?"
p118
aVAnd I told him, "I will make you a teacher."
p119
aVFinally, he accepted my offer,
p120
aVand once I started a class in his compound,
p121
aVthe word spread all over.
p122
aVIn a matter of one year,
p123
aVwe had 25 schools set up,
p124
aV15,000 children going to school,
p125
aVand it was amazing.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VThank you.
p130
aVThank you.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut of course, we're doing all our work, we were giving teacher training.
p133
aVWe were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law.
p134
aVWe were giving all kinds of training.
p135
aVAnd one day, I tell you,
p136
aVone day I was in the office in Peshawar, Pakistan.
p137
aVAll of a sudden, I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors
p138
aVand telling me, "Run away, hide!"
p139
aVAnd you know, as a leader, what do you do?
p140
aVYou're scared. You know it's dangerous.
p141
aVYou know your life is on the line.
p142
aVBut as a leader, you have to hold it together.
p143
aVYou have to hold it together and show strength.
p144
aVSo I said, "What's going on?"
p145
aVAnd these people were pouring into my office.
p146
aVSo I invited them to the office.
p147
aVThey came, and there were nine of them \u2014 nine Taliban.
p148
aVThey were the ugliest looking men you can ever see.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VVery mean-looking people,
p153
aVblack clothes, black turban,
p154
aVand they pour into my office.
p155
aVAnd I invited them to have a seat and have tea.
p156
aVThey said no. They are not going to drink tea.
p157
aVAnd of course, with the tone of voice they were using,
p158
aVit was very scary,
p159
aVbut I was really shaking up.
p160
aVBut also I was strong, holding myself up.
p161
aVAnd, of course, by that time, you know how I dress \u2014
p162
aVI dress from head to toe in a black hijab.
p163
aVThe only thing you could see, my eyes.
p164
aVThey asked me, "What are you doing?
p165
aVDon't you know that school is banned for girls?
p166
aVWhat are you doing here?"
p167
aVAnd you know, I just looked at them,
p168
aVand I said, "What school? Where is the school?"
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd they look at my face, and they said, "You are teaching girls here."
p175
aVI said, "This is a house of somebody.
p176
aVWe have some students coming,
p177
aVand they are all learning Koran, Holy Book.
p178
aVAnd you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,
p179
aVthey can be a good wife,
p180
aVand they can obey their husband."
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd I tell you one thing:
p185
aVthat's the way you work with those people, and you know \u2014
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VSo by that time, they started speaking Pashto.
p190
aVThey talked to each other,
p191
aVand they said, "Let's go, leave her alone, she's OK."
p192
aVAnd you know, this time, I offered them tea again,
p193
aVand they took a sip and they left.
p194
aVBy that time, my staff poured into my office.
p195
aVThey were scared to death.
p196
aVThey didn't know why they didn't kill me.
p197
aVThey didn't know why they didn't take me away.
p198
aVBut everybody was happy to see me.
p199
aVVery happy, and I was happy to be alive, of course.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VOf course, I was happy to be alive.
p204
aVBut also, as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban \u2014
p205
aVof course during the Taliban there is another story.
p206
aVWe went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls,
p207
aV3,000 students underground, and continuously we trained.
p208
aa(lp209
VWith the fall of the Taliban, we went into the country,
p210
aVand we opened school after school.
p211
aVWe opened women's learning center.
p212
aVWe continuously opened clinics.
p213
aVWe worked with mothers and children.
p214
aVWe had reproductive health training.
p215
aVWe had all kinds of training that you can imagine.
p216
aVI was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work.
p217
aVAnd one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard,
p218
aVI was going up north of Kabul,
p219
aVand all of a sudden, again,
p220
aVI was stopped in the middle of the road
p221
aVby 19 young men.
p222
aVRifles on their shoulders, they blocked the road.
p223
aVAnd I told my driver, "What's going on?"
p224
aVAnd the driver said, "I don't know."
p225
aVHe asked them. They said, "We have nothing to do with you."
p226
aVThey called my name. They said, "We want her."
p227
aVMy bodyguard got out, said, "I can answer you.
p228
aVWhat do you want?"
p229
aVThey said, "Nothing." They called my name.
p230
aVAnd by that time, the women are yelling and screaming inside the car.
p231
aVI am very shaken up, and I told myself, this is it.
p232
aVThis time, we all are going to be killed.
p233
aVThere is no doubt in my mind.
p234
aVBut still, the moment comes, and you take strength
p235
aVfrom whatever you believe and whatever you do.
p236
aVIt's in your heart.
p237
aVYou believe in your worth, and you can walk on it.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo I just hold myself on the side of the car.
p240
aVMy leg was shaking, and I got outside.
p241
aVAnd I asked them, "What can I do for you?"
p242
aVYou know what they said to me?
p243
aVThey said, "We know who you are.
p244
aVWe know where you are going.
p245
aVEvery day you go up north here and there.
p246
aVYou train women, you teach them
p247
aVand also you give them an opportunity to have a job.
p248
aVYou build their skills. How about us?"
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
V"And you know, how about us?
p255
aVWhat are we going to do?"
p256
aVI looked at them, and I said, "I don't know."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VThey said, "It's OK.
p261
aVThe only thing we can do, what we know,
p262
aVfrom the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill.
p263
aVThat's all we know."
p264
aVAnd you know what that means.
p265
aVIt's a trap to me, of course.
p266
aVSo I walk out of there. They said, "We'll let you go, go."
p267
aVAnd so I walked into the car, I sit in the car,
p268
aVand I told the driver, "Turn around and go back to the office."
p269
aVAt that time, we only were supporting girls.
p270
aVWe only had money for women to train them,
p271
aVto send them to school, and nothing else.
p272
aa(lp273
VBy the time I came to the office,
p274
aVof course my trainers were gone.
p275
aVThey ran away home. Nobody stayed there.
p276
aVMy bodyguard was the only one there,
p277
aVand my voice was completely gone.
p278
aVI was shaken up, and I sat on my table,
p279
aVand I said, "What am I going to do?"
p280
aVHow am I going to solve this problem?
p281
aVBecause we had training going on up north already.
p282
aVHundreds of women were there coming to get training.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo I was sitting there, all of a sudden, at this moment,
p285
aVtalking about momentum, we are,
p286
aVat that moment,
p287
aVone of my wonderful donors called me about a report.
p288
aVAnd she asked me, "Sakena?" And I answered her.
p289
aVShe said, "It's not you. What's wrong with you?"
p290
aVI said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.
p291
aVNo matter what I tried to do, she didn't believe me,
p292
aVand she asked me again.
p293
aV"OK, tell me what's going on?"
p294
aVI told her the whole story.
p295
aVAt that time, she said, "OK, you go next time, and you will help them.
p296
aVYou will help them."
p297
aVAnd when, two days later, I went the same route,
p298
aVand do you know, they were not in here,
p299
aVthey were a little back further,
p300
aVthe same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle
p301
aVand pointing to us to stop the car.
p302
aVSo we stopped the car.
p303
aVI got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me."
p304
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p305
aVI said, "On one condition, that whatever I say, you accept it."
p306
aVAnd they said, yes, they do.
p307
aVSo I took them to the mosque,
p308
aVand to make a long story short,
p309
aVI told them I'd give them teachers.
p310
aVToday, they are the best trainers.
p311
aVThey learn English,
p312
aVthey learn how to be teachers,
p313
aVthey learn computers,
p314
aVand they are my guides.
p315
aVEvery area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas,
p316
aVthey go with me. They are ahead, and we go.
p317
aVAnd they protect us.
p318
aVAnd \u2014
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VThank you.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VThat tells you that education transforms people.
p327
aVWhen you educate people,
p328
aVthey are going to be different,
p329
aVand today all over,
p330
aVwe need to work for gender equality.
p331
aVWe cannot only train women but forget about the men,
p332
aVbecause the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo we started training men because the men should know
p337
aVthe potential of women,
p338
aVknow how much these potential men has,
p339
aVand how much these women can do the same job they are doing.
p340
aVSo we are continuously giving training to men,
p341
aVand I really believe strongly.
p342
aVI live in a country that was a beautiful country.
p343
aVI just want to share this with you.
p344
aVIt was a beautiful country,
p345
aVbeautiful, peaceful country.
p346
aVWe were going everywhere.
p347
aVWomen were getting education:
p348
aVlawyer, engineer, teacher,
p349
aVand we were going from house to house.
p350
aVWe never locked our doors.
p351
aVBut you know what happened to my country.
p352
aVToday, people cannot walk out of their door without security issues.
p353
aVBut we want the same Afghanistan we had before.
p354
aVAnd I want to tell you the other side.
p355
aVToday, the women of Afghanistan are working very, very hard.
p356
aVThey are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers.
p357
aVThey are training to be doctors, back again.
p358
aVThey are training to be teachers,
p359
aVand they are running businesses.
p360
aVSo it is so wonderful
p361
aVto see people like that reach their complete potential,
p362
aVand all of this is going to happen.
p363
aa(lp364
VI want to share this with you,
p365
aVbecause of love,
p366
aVbecause of compassion,
p367
aVand because of trust and honesty.
p368
aVIf you have these few things with you,
p369
aVyou will accomplish.
p370
aVWe have one poet, Mawl\u0101n\u0101 R\u016bm\u012b.
p371
aVHe said that by having compassion
p372
aVand having love, you can conquer the world.
p373
aVAnd I tell you, we could.
p374
aVAnd if we could do it in Afghanistan,
p375
aVI am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you very, very much.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VThank you. Thank you.
