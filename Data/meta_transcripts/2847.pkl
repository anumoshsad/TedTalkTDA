VAre you tired of your boss?
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VAre you tired of going to work
p8
aVand making money for other people?
p9
aVAnd who are those people anyways?
p10
aVThose people that make money from your work.
p11
aVWell, they're capitalists.
p12
aVThey have capital,
p13
aVand they use your labor to make more capital.
p14
aVSo if you're tired of going to work
p15
aVand making money for other people,
p16
aVthen you're probably like me \u2014
p17
aVjust tired of capitalism.
p18
aVWhich is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VI own a small business \u2014
p23
aVRco Tires in Compton.
p24
aVA few years ago, when I read Van Jones,
p25
aVand he wrote, "Let's make green collar jobs in the hood,"
p26
aVI took him really seriously.
p27
aVSo I cofounded, own and operate a tire recycling company,
p28
aVand I'm really proud of what we've done.
p29
aVSo far, we've recycled a hundred million pounds of rubber.
p30
aVThat's 21 million gallons of oil diverted from landfills
p31
aVinto new products.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Cheers)
p34
aa(lp35
VWe also employ about 15 guys \u2014
p36
aVmostly people of color,
p37
aVmost of whom are felons,
p38
aVand we pay above the minimum wage,
p39
aVand we are now proud members of the United Steelworkers Union.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, Rco is not a cooperative now.
p44
aVIt's a privately held company with community-minded ownership,
p45
aVbut I would like it to become one.
p46
aVI would like for them to fire the boss \u2014
p47
aVthat's me.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I'm going to tell you why,
p52
aVbut first, let me tell you how we got started.
p53
aVSo a lot of people ask,
p54
aV"How did Rco come to be?"
p55
aVAnd I have to be really honest.
p56
aVI leveraged my white privilege.
p57
aVSo, here's how white privilege worked for me and Rco.
p58
aVMy white grandmother was born on her family's plantation
p59
aVin Arkansas in 1918.
p60
aVShe traveled with her white father west,
p61
aVfollowing the oil boom.
p62
aVAnd he held various union oil jobs \u2014
p63
aVjobs which would have never been given to my black great-grandfather,
p64
aVhad he lived here at the time.
p65
aVGranny became a hairdresser
p66
aVand then got a loan with her husband
p67
aVwho built their home in West Los Angeles \u2014
p68
aVa loan which would never have been given to a black family at the time.
p69
aVAnd after my grandfather passed away,
p70
aVmy granny was able to keep that house
p71
aVbecause she had his pension and his health care
p72
aVfrom a state job which he held,
p73
aVwhich again, would have never been given to a black man
p74
aVbefore the anti-discrimination act of the 1960s.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, you fast-forward 30 years,
p77
aVand I graduate,
p78
aVand I want to start my own business
p79
aVwith a pile of debt and a credit card,
p80
aVand no experience in the tire industry.
p81
aVBut I had what most people didn't have.
p82
aVI had a clean, safe, free place to live.
p83
aVI moved in with my grandmother,
p84
aVand I was able to rent our first warehouse,
p85
aVbuy our first truck,
p86
aVpay our first employees,
p87
aVbecause I didn't have to worry about paying myself,
p88
aVbecause I didn't need to feed myself,
p89
aVbecause I am the direct beneficiary of generations of white privilege.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, telling the story of white privilege is important
p92
aVbecause very often people say,
p93
aV"Oh, we want more companies like yours.
p94
aVWe want more Rco's,
p95
aVwe want more black-owned businesses,
p96
aVfemale-led, triple bottom line,
p97
aVBan the Box,
p98
aVgreen manufacturing companies," right?
p99
aVBut the question we have to ask is, where is the wealth?
p100
aVWhere is the money?
p101
aVWhere's the capital in our communities
p102
aVto build the types of businesses that we want?
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd in telling a story of the white side of my family,
p105
aVI needed a dozen ways
p106
aVwhere blacks were excluded from the economy,
p107
aVwhereas the white side of my family was able to gain access and traction,
p108
aVand build wealth ...
p109
aVPrimarily because racism and capitalism are best homies, but \u2014
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
Vbut what that means is that when we ask ourselves,
p114
aV"Why are our communities broke?" \u2014
p115
aVLike, we're not just broke because we're broke;
p116
aVwe're broke for a reason.
p117
aVHistorical context really does matter.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut our history tells another story as well.
p120
aVThere's this incredible book called "Collective Courage,"
p121
aVwhich is the story of how thousands of African Americans
p122
aVhave been able to build businesses and schools,
p123
aVhospitals, farming cooperatives,
p124
aVbanks, financial institutions \u2014
p125
aVentire communities and sovereign economies,
p126
aVwithout a lot of capital.
p127
aVAnd they did it by working together
p128
aVand leveraging their community assets
p129
aVand trusting each other
p130
aVand putting solidarity first \u2014
p131
aVnot just profits by any means necessary.
p132
aVAnd they didn't have to wait around for celebrities and athletes
p133
aVto bring their money back to the hood.
p134
aVHowever, if you are a celebrity or an athlete,
p135
aVand you're listening to this,
p136
aVplease feel free to bring your money.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBut they did it through cooperative economics,
p141
aVbecause they knew
p142
aVthat capitalism was never going to finance black liberation.
p143
aVSo, there are so many great examples in this book,
p144
aVand I suggest that everybody just read it
p145
aVbecause it answers the question I asked earlier,
p146
aVwhich was where are we going to get the wealth
p147
aVto build the types of business that we want.
p148
aVAnd the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics.
p149
aa(lp150
VThere's a lot of different versions of cooperativism.
p151
aVWhat I'm talking about today is worker ownership.
p152
aVYou may not have heard of worker ownership,
p153
aVbut it's been an incredible tool
p154
aVfor black economic liberation for a century,
p155
aVand it's also working all over the world right now.
p156
aVYou may have heard of Black Wall Street
p157
aVor maybe the Zapatistas,
p158
aVbut I'll give you an example that's a little bit closer to home.
p159
aVRight now, today, in South Bronx,
p160
aVis the country's largest worker-owned company.
p161
aVIt's called Cooperative Home Care Associates,
p162
aVand it was founded by black and Latinx home care workers
p163
aVwho are now able to pay themselves living wages,
p164
aVthey have full-time hours,
p165
aVthey have benefits and a pension,
p166
aVthrough their membership as a unit of SEIU.
p167
aVAnd these women owners now receive a dividend back on their ownership
p168
aVevery year that the company has been profitable,
p169
aVwhich has been most years.
p170
aVSo they're able to really enjoy the fruits of their labor
p171
aVbecause they fired the boss.
p172
aVThey don't have any big investors.
p173
aVThey don't have fat-cat CEOs
p174
aVor absentee owners taking the profit out of the company.
p175
aVThey each pay in about 1,000 dollars over time
p176
aVin order to gain ownership,
p177
aVand now they own their job.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, there's hundreds of more examples of companies like this
p180
aVspringing up all across the country.
p181
aVAnd I'm so inspired by what they're doing,
p182
aVbecause it really represents an alternative
p183
aVto the type of economy we have now,
p184
aVwhich exploits all of us.
p185
aVIt also represents an alternative
p186
aVto waiting around for big investors to bring chain stores,
p187
aVor big-box stores to our communities,
p188
aVbecause honestly, those types of developments,
p189
aVthey steal resources from our communities.
p190
aVThey put our mom-and-pop shops out of business,
p191
aVthey make our entrepreneurs into wage workers,
p192
aVand they take money out of our pocket
p193
aVand send it to their shareholders.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo, I was so inspired by all these stories of resistance and resilience
p196
aVthat I got together with a few people here in Los Angeles,
p197
aVand we created LUCI.
p198
aVLUCI stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative,
p199
aVand our objective is to create more worker-owned businesses
p200
aVhere in Los Angeles.
p201
aVSo far, in the last year, we've created two:
p202
aVPacific Electric, an electrical company,
p203
aVand Vermont Gage Carwash,
p204
aVwhich is right here in South-Central,
p205
aVsome of you guys might be familiar with it.
p206
aVThis long-time carwash is now owned and operated by its 20 workers,
p207
aVall of whom are union members as well.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo you might be wondering why the focus on union-worker ownership,
p212
aVbut there's a lot of good reasons
p213
aVwhy the labor movement is a natural ally to the worker-ownership movement.
p214
aVTo build these companies that we want in our community,
p215
aVwe need a few things.
p216
aVWe're going to need money, people and training.
p217
aVUnions have all of those things.
p218
aVAmerica's working class has been paying union dues for decades,
p219
aVand with it, our unions have been building
p220
aVdignified, decent, and democratic workplaces for us.
p221
aVHowever, union jobs are on the steep decline,
p222
aVand it's time for us to start calling on our unions
p223
aVto really bring all of their financial and political capital
p224
aVto bear in the creation of new, union, living-wage jobs
p225
aVin our communities.
p226
aVAlso, union halls are full of union members
p227
aVwho understand the importance of solidarity
p228
aVand the power of collective action.
p229
aVThese are the types of folks that want more union businesses to exist,
p230
aVso let's build them with them.
p231
aa(lp232
VLearning from our unions,
p233
aVlearning from our past,
p234
aVlearning from our peers,
p235
aVare all going to be very important to our success,
p236
aVwhich is why I'd like to leave you with one last example
p237
aVand a vision for the future ...
p238
aVand that vision is Mondragon, Spain.
p239
aVMondragon, Spain is a community built entirely around worker cooperatives.
p240
aVThere's 260-plus businesses here,
p241
aVmanufacturing everything from bicycles to washing machines to transformers.
p242
aVAnd this group of businesses now employs 80,000 people
p243
aVand earns more than 12 billion euros in revenue every year.
p244
aVAnd all of the companies there are owned by the people that work in them.
p245
aVThey've also built universities and hospitals and financial institutions.
p246
aVI mean, imagine if we could build something like this in South-Central.
p247
aVThe late mayor of Jackson had a similar idea.
p248
aVHe wanted to turn his entire city into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,
p249
aVcalling his ambitious plan "Jackson Rising."
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd when I look at Mondragon,
p252
aVI see really what working-class people can do for ourselves
p253
aVwhen we work together
p254
aVand make decisions for ourselves and each other
p255
aVand our communities.
p256
aVAnd what's really incredible about Mondragon
p257
aVis that while we are dreaming about them,
p258
aVthey are dreaming about us.
p259
aVThis community in Spain has decided to launch an international initiative
p260
aVto create more communities like it all over the world,
p261
aVby linking up with unions,
p262
aVby supporting organizations like LUCI,
p263
aVand by educating folks about the worker-ownership model.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, here's what you can do to be a part of it.
p266
aVIf you're a union member, go to your union meetings,
p267
aVand make sure that your union has a worker-ownership initiative,
p268
aVand become a part of it.
p269
aVIf you're an entrepreneur,
p270
aVif you have a small business,
p271
aVor you're interested in starting one,
p272
aVthen link up with LUCI or another organization like us
p273
aVto help you get started on the cooperative model.
p274
aVIf you're a politician,
p275
aVor you work for one,
p276
aVor you just like talking to them,
p277
aVplease get the city, state, federal and county legislation passed
p278
aVthat we need in order to fund and support worker-owned businesses.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd for everybody else,
p281
aVlearn about our history, learn about our models,
p282
aVand seek us out so can support us,
p283
aVyou can buy from us, invest in us, lend to us and join us,
p284
aVbecause it's really going to take all of us
p285
aVin order to build the more just and sustainable and resilient economy
p286
aVthat we want for ourselves and our children.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd with that,
p289
aVI would like to leave you with a quote from Arundhati Roy,
p290
aVand she writes ...
p291
aV"Our strategy should not be only to confront Empire,
p292
aVbut to lay siege to it.
p293
aVTo deprive it of oxygen.
p294
aVTo mock it.
p295
aVTo shame it.
p296
aVWith our art,
p297
aVour literature,
p298
aVour music,
p299
aVour brilliance,
p300
aVour joy,
p301
aVour sheer relentlessness \u2014
p302
aVand our ability to tell our own stories.
p303
aVNot the stories that we're being brainwashed to believe.
p304
aVThe corporate revolution will collapse
p305
aVif we refuse to buy what they're selling \u2014
p306
aVtheir ideas,
p307
aVtheir version of history,
p308
aVtheir wars,
p309
aVtheir weapons,
p310
aVtheir sense of inevitability.
p311
aVBecause know this:
p312
aVThey be few and we be many.
p313
aVThey need us more than we need them.
p314
aVAnother world is not only possible,
p315
aVshe's on her way.
p316
aVAnd on a quiet day,
p317
aVI can hear her breathing."
