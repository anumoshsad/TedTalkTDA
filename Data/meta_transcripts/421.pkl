VThe career that I started early on in my life
p4
aVwas looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,
p5
aVand at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,
p6
aVand high deserts and low deserts.
p7
aVUntil about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,
p8
aVand I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I have a really cool day job\u2014 I get to do some really amazing stuff.
p11
aVI work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.
p12
aVMany of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,
p13
aVbut nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,
p14
aVand contain unbelievable biological wonders
p15
aVthat are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.
p16
aVApart from the intrinsic value
p17
aVof the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,
p18
aVwe're also using these as templates
p19
aVfor figuring out how to go look
p20
aVfor life on other planets.
p21
aVParticularly Mars, but also Europa,
p22
aVthe small, icy moon around Jupiter.
p23
aVAnd perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.
p24
aa(lp25
VI'm very passionately interested in the human future,
p26
aVon the Moon and Mars particularly,
p27
aVand elsewhere in the solar system.
p28
aVI think it's time that we transitioned
p29
aVto a solar system-going civilization and species.
p30
aVAnd, as an outgrowth of all of this then,
p31
aVI wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,
p32
aVthink about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.
p33
aVNotably Mars, as a first example.
p34
aa(lp35
VSomething I never talk about in scientific meetings
p36
aVis how I actually got to this state
p37
aVand why I do the work that I do.
p38
aVWhy don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?
p39
aVAnd then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.
p40
aVBecause in the mid-1950s,
p41
aVwhen I was a tiny child,
p42
aVthey had the audacity to launch
p43
aVa very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,
p44
aVwhich sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
p45
aVAnd a tremendous amount of money
p46
aVwent into the funding of science
p47
aVand mathematics skills for kids.
p48
aVAnd I'm a product of that generation,
p49
aVlike so many other of my peers.
p50
aVIt really caught hold of us, and caught fire,
p51
aVand it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.
p52
aa(lp53
VOf course, refusing to grow up \u2014
p54
aV\u2014 even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,
p55
aVbut I do a fairly good job of that \u2014
p56
aVbut really retaining that childlike quality
p57
aVof not caring what other people think
p58
aVabout what you're interested in, is really critical.
p59
aVThe next element is the fact that
p60
aVI have applied a value judgment
p61
aVand my value judgment is that the presence of life
p62
aVis better than no life.
p63
aVAnd so, life is more valuable than no life.
p64
aVAnd so I think that that holds together
p65
aVa great deal of the work
p66
aVthat people in this audience approach.
p67
aa(lp68
VI'm very interested in Mars, of course,
p69
aVand that was a product of my being a young undergraduate
p70
aVwhen the Viking Landers landed on Mars.
p71
aVAnd that took what had been
p72
aVa tiny little astronomical object in the sky,
p73
aVthat you would see as a dot,
p74
aVand turned it completely into a landscape,
p75
aVas that very first primitive picture
p76
aVcame rastering across the screen.
p77
aVAnd when it became a landscape,
p78
aVit also became a destination,
p79
aVand altered, really, the course of my life.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn my graduate years I worked with
p82
aVmy colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,
p83
aVat the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
p84
aVworking on global change issues.
p85
aVWe've written a number of things on
p86
aVthe role of Gaia hypothesis \u2014
p87
aVwhether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity
p88
aVin any meaningful scientific sense,
p89
aVand then, as an outgrowth of that,
p90
aVI worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, wonderful things and grim things.
p93
aVBut what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet
p94
aVwith external eyes, not just as our home.
p95
aVAnd that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,
p96
aVto try to then think about the way
p97
aVour planet behaves, as a planet,
p98
aVand with the life that's on it.
p99
aVAnd all of this seems to me to be
p100
aVa salient point in history.
p101
aVWe're getting ready to begin to go
p102
aVthrough the process of leaving our planet of origin
p103
aVand out into the wider solar system and beyond.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, back to Mars.
p106
aVHow hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?
p107
aVWell, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,
p108
aVeven on this planet.
p109
aVSo, finding life on another planet
p110
aVis a non-trivial occupation
p111
aVand we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.
p112
aVWhether or not you think it's likely to be successful
p113
aVsort of depends on what you think about
p114
aVthe chances of life in the universe.
p115
aVI think, myself,
p116
aVthat life is a natural outgrowth
p117
aVof the increasing complexification of matter over time.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,
p120
aVand then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,
p121
aVand you get planets forming \u2014
p122
aVand life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.
p123
aVCertainly, in the last 15 years,
p124
aVwe've seen increasing numbers of planets
p125
aVoutside of our solar system being confirmed,
p126
aVand just last month, a couple of weeks ago,
p127
aVa planet in the size-class of Earth
p128
aVhas actually been found.
p129
aVAnd so this is very exciting news.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo, my first bold prediction is that,
p132
aVis that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
p133
aVIt's going to be everywhere we look \u2014
p134
aVwhere there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
p135
aVAnd those planetary systems are going to be very common.
p136
aVSo, what about life on Mars?
p137
aVWell, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago
p138
aVwhat I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,
p139
aVI would've probably said, a couple of percent.
p140
aVAnd even that was considered outrageous at the time.
p141
aVI was once sneeringly introduced
p142
aVby a former NASA official,
p143
aVas the only person on the planet
p144
aVwho still thought there was life on Mars.
p145
aVOf course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,
p146
aVso there's a certain amount of glory
p147
aVin outliving your adversaries.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut things have changed greatly
p150
aVover the last dozen years.
p151
aVAnd the reason that they have changed
p152
aVis because we now have new information.
p153
aVThe amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,
p154
aVand the MER Rover missions
p155
aVthat are on Mars as we speak now
p156
aVand the European Space Agency's Mars Express,
p157
aVhas taught us a number of amazing things.
p158
aVThere is sub-surface ice on that planet.
p159
aVAnd so where there is water,
p160
aVthere is a very high chance of our kind of life.
p161
aVThere's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place \u2013
p162
aVone of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,
p163
aVand there are these amazing structures called blueberries,
p164
aVwhich are these little, rocky concretions
p165
aVthat we are busy making biologically
p166
aVin my lab right now.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, with all of these things put together,
p169
aVI think that the chances of life
p170
aVare much greater than I would've ever thought.
p171
aVI think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,
p172
aVis maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.
p173
aVSo this is a very bold statement.
p174
aVI think it's there, and I think we need
p175
aVto go look for it, and I think it's underground.
p176
aVSo the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.
p177
aVHow do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?
p178
aVHow do you plan to look for it?
p179
aVHow do you know it when you find it?
p180
aVBecause if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it \u2014
p181
aVit would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
p184
aVVery critically, how do we protect it,
p185
aVif we find it, and not contaminate it?
p186
aVAnd also, even perhaps more critically, because
p187
aVthis is the only home planet we have,
p188
aVhow do we protect us from it, while we study it?
p189
aVSo why might it be hard to find?
p190
aVWell, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy
p191
aVto study microscopic things,
p192
aValthough the amazing tools that we now have to do that
p193
aVallow us to study things in much greater depth,
p194
aVat much smaller scales than ever before.
p195
aVBut it's probably hiding, because if you are out
p196
aVsequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,
p197
aVand other things might want to eat you, or consume you.
p198
aVAnd so, there's a game of predator-prey
p199
aVthat's going to be, essentially, universal, really,
p200
aVin any kind of biological system.
p201
aVIt also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties \u2013
p202
aVits chemistry, or its size.
p203
aa(lp204
VWe say small, but what does that mean?
p205
aVIs it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
p206
aVIs it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
p207
aVAnd speed of activity, which is something that we face
p208
aVin our work with sub-surface organisms,
p209
aVbecause they grow very, very slowly.
p210
aVIf I were to take a swab off your teeth
p211
aVand plate it on a Petri plate,
p212
aVwithin about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.
p213
aVBut the organisms that we work with,
p214
aVfrom the sub-surface of Earth,
p215
aVvery often it's months \u2014 and in many cases, years \u2014
p216
aVbefore we see any growth whatsoever.
p217
aVSo they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut the real issue is that we are guided by
p220
aVour limited experience,
p221
aVand until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,
p222
aVthen we can't recognize what to look for,
p223
aVor how to plan for it.
p224
aVSo, perspective is everything
p225
aVand, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,
p226
aVI have learned to think about Earth
p227
aVas an extraterrestrial planet.
p228
aVAnd this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.
p229
aa(lp230
VThis is my favorite game on airplanes:
p231
aVwhere you're in an airplane and you look out the window,
p232
aVyou see the horizon.
p233
aVI always turn my head on the side,
p234
aVand that simple change makes me go from
p235
aVseeing this planet as home,
p236
aVto seeing it as a planet.
p237
aVIt's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it
p238
aVwhen I'm sitting in a window seat.
p239
aVWell, this is what we apply to our work.
p240
aVThis shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.
p241
aVThis is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,
p242
aVand this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.
p243
aVThere is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide
p244
aVcoming into this cave from volcanic sources
p245
aVand from the breakdown of evaporite \u2014
p246
aVminerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed \u2014
p247
aVand it is a completely hostile environment for us.
p248
aVWe have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,
p249
aVand 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.
p250
aVThis is regularly several hundred parts per million.
p251
aVSo, it's a very hazardous environment,
p252
aVwith CO as well, and many other gases.
p253
aVThese extreme physical and chemical parameters
p254
aVmake the biology that grows in these places very special.
p255
aVBecause contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.
p256
aa(lp257
VThis is one of the richest caves
p258
aVthat we have found on the planet, anywhere.
p259
aVIt's bursting with life.
p260
aVThe extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,
p261
aVbut one of the reasons that we're interested in them
p262
aVis because they represent, really,
p263
aVthe average conditions that we may expect on other planets.
p264
aVSo, this is part of the ability that we have,
p265
aVto try to stretch our imagination,
p266
aVin terms of what we may find in the future.
p267
aVThere's so much life in this cave,
p268
aVand I can't even begin
p269
aVto scratch the surface of it with you.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut one of the most famous objects out of this
p272
aVare what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.
p273
aVThis stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.
p274
aVAnd this is produced by bacteria who are actually
p275
aVmaking more sulfuric acid,
p276
aVand living at pHs right around zero.
p277
aVAnd so, this stuff is like battery acid.
p278
aVAnd yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.
p279
aVIn fact, there's so much energy available
p280
aVfor biology in this cave,
p281
aVthat there's actually a huge number of cavefish.
p282
aVAnd the local Zoque Indians
p283
aVharvest this twice a year,
p284
aVas part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is very unusual for caves.
p287
aVIn some of the other amazing caves that we work in \u2014
p288
aVthis is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,
p289
aVand this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
p290
aVIt's 115 miles of mapped passage,
p291
aVit's pristine, it has no natural opening
p292
aVand it's a gigantic biological,
p293
aVgeo-microbiological laboratory.
p294
aVIn this cave, great areas are covered by
p295
aVthis reddish material that you see here,
p296
aVand also these enormous crystals
p297
aVof selenite that you can see dangling down.
p298
aVThis stuff is produced biologically.
p299
aVThis is the breakdown product of the bedrock,
p300
aVthat organisms are busy munching their way through.
p301
aVThey take iron and manganese minerals
p302
aVwithin the bedrock and they oxidize them.
p303
aVAnd every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.
p304
aVAnd that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,
p305
aVto run their life processes.
p306
aVInterestingly enough, they also do this
p307
aVwith uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd so, the obvious avenue
p310
aVfor bio-remediation
p311
aVcomes from organisms like this.
p312
aVThese organisms we now bring into the lab,
p313
aVand you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,
p314
aVand get them to reproduce the precise biominerals
p315
aVthat we find on the walls of these caves.
p316
aVSo, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.
p317
aVWell, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,
p318
aVwhich are a by-product of volcanic activity,
p319
aVwe find these walls totally covered,
p320
aVin many cases,
p321
aVby these beautiful, glistening silver walls,
p322
aVor shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.
p323
aVAnd these are mineral deposits
p324
aVthat are also made by bacteria.
p325
aVAnd you can see in these central images here,
p326
aVscanning electron micrographs of some of these guys \u2014
p327
aVthese are gardens of these bacteria.
p328
aa(lp329
VOne of the interesting things about these particular guys
p330
aVis that they're in the actinomycete
p331
aVand streptomycete groups of the bacteria,
p332
aVwhich is where we get most of our antibiotics.
p333
aVThe sub-surface of Earth
p334
aVcontains a vast biodiversity.
p335
aVAnd these organisms,
p336
aVbecause they're very separate from the surface,
p337
aVmake a vast array of novel compounds.
p338
aVAnd so, the potential for exploiting this
p339
aVfor pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses
p340
aVis completely untapped,
p341
aVbut probably exceeds most of the rest
p342
aVof the biodiversity of the planet.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo, lava-tube caves\u2014
p345
aVI've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.
p346
aVWe know that on Mars and the Moon
p347
aVthere are tons of these structures.
p348
aVWe can see them.
p349
aVOn the left you can see a lava tube forming
p350
aVat a recent eruption \u2014 Mount Etna in Sicily \u2014
p351
aVand this is the way these tubes form.
p352
aVAnd when they hollow out,
p353
aVthen they become habitats for organisms.
p354
aVThese are all over the planet Mars,
p355
aVand we're busy cataloguing them now.
p356
aVAnd so, there's very interesting cave real estate
p357
aVon Mars, at least of that type.
p358
aa(lp359
VIn order to access
p360
aVthese sub-surface environments that we're interested in,
p361
aVwe're very interested in developing the tools to do this.
p362
aVYou know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
p363
aVIt requires crawling, climbing,
p364
aVrope-work, technical rope-work
p365
aVand many other complex human motions
p366
aVin order to access these.
p367
aVWe face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?
p368
aVWhy would we want to do it robotically?
p369
aVWell, we're going to be sending
p370
aVrobotic missions to Mars
p371
aVlong in advance of human missions.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made
p374
aVabout the preciousness of any life that we may find
p375
aVon Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.
p376
aVAnd one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it
p377
aVis to have an intermediary.
p378
aVAnd in this case, we're imagining
p379
aVintermediary robotic devices
p380
aVthat can actually do some of that
p381
aVfront-end work for us,
p382
aVto protect any potential life that we find.
p383
aVI'm not going to go through all of these projects now,
p384
aVbut we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,
p385
aVin collaboration with a number of different groups.
p386
aVI want to talk specifically about the
p387
aVarray that you see on the top.
p388
aa(lp389
VThese are hopping microbot swarms.
p390
aVI'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory
p391
aVand my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,
p392
aVand we have come up with the idea
p393
aVof having little, jumping bean-like
p394
aVrobots
p395
aVthat are propelled by artificial muscle,
p396
aVwhich is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties \u2014
p397
aVare the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.
p398
aVAnd these allow them to hop.
p399
aVThey behave with
p400
aVa swarm behavior,
p401
aVwhere they relate to each other,
p402
aVmodeled after insect swarm behavior,
p403
aVand they could be made very numerous.
p404
aVAnd so, one can send a thousand of them,
p405
aVas you can see in this upper left-hand picture,
p406
aVa thousand of them could fit into the payload bay
p407
aVthat was used for one of the current MER Rovers.
p408
aVAnd these little guys \u2014 you could lose many of them.
p409
aVIf you send a thousand of them,
p410
aVyou could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.
p411
aVAnd so, that allows you the flexibility
p412
aVto go into very challenging terrain
p413
aVand actually make your way where you want to go.
p414
aa(lp415
VNow, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds
p416
aVabout caves and the human expansion beyond Earth
p417
aVas a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.
p418
aVIt occurred to us a number of years ago
p419
aVthat caves have many properties
p420
aVthat people have used
p421
aVand other organisms have used as habitat in the past.
p422
aVAnd perhaps it's time we started to explore those,
p423
aVin the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.
p424
aa(lp425
VSo, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,
p426
aVlooking at the irreducible set of technologies
p427
aVthat you would need in order to
p428
aVactually allow people to inhabit lava tubes
p429
aVon the Moon or Mars.
p430
aVIt turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,
p431
aVand we have gone
p432
aVin the relatively primitive technology direction.
p433
aVSo, we're talking about things like inflatable liners
p434
aVthat can conform to the complex topological shape
p435
aVon the inside of a cave,
p436
aVfoamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,
p437
aVvarious ways of getting breathing gases
p438
aVmade from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.
p439
aVAnd the future is there for us
p440
aVto use these lava-tube caves on Mars.
p441
aVAnd right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,
p442
aVbut I think in the future we'll be using them
p443
aVfor habitat and science on these other bodies.
p444
aa(lp445
VNow, my view of what the current status
p446
