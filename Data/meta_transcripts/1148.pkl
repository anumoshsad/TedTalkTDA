VI'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,
p4
aVso I put children to sleep for a living.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVAnd I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVBut what I actually mostly do
p9
aVis I manage the pain management service
p10
aVat the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.
p11
aVAnd it's from the experience
p12
aVfrom about 20 or 25 years of doing that
p13
aVthat I want to bring to you the message this morning,
p14
aVthat pain is a disease.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow most of the time,
p17
aVyou think of pain as a symptom of a disease,
p18
aVand that's true most of the time.
p19
aVIt's the symptom of a tumor or an infection
p20
aVor an inflammation or an operation.
p21
aVBut about 10 percent of the time,
p22
aVafter the patient has recovered from one of those events,
p23
aVpain persists.
p24
aVIt persists for months
p25
aVand oftentimes for years,
p26
aVand when that happens,
p27
aVit is its own disease.
p28
aVAnd before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens
p29
aVand what we can do about it,
p30
aVI want to show you how it feels for my patients.
p31
aVSo imagine, if you will,
p32
aVthat I'm stroking your arm with this feather,
p33
aVas I'm stroking my arm right now.
p34
aVNow, I want you to imagine
p35
aVthat I'm stroking it with this.
p36
aVPlease keep your seat.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVA very different feeling.
p39
aVNow what does it have to do with chronic pain?
p40
aVImagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
p41
aVImagine what your life would be like
p42
aVif I were to stroke it with this feather,
p43
aVbut your brain was telling you
p44
aVthat this is what you are feeling \u2014
p45
aVand that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.
p46
aVIn fact, imagine something even worse.
p47
aVImagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,
p48
aVand their brain [was] telling them
p49
aVthat they were feeling this hot torch.
p50
aa(lp51
VThat was the experience of my patient, Chandler,
p52
aVwhom you see in the photograph.
p53
aVAs you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.
p54
aVShe was 16 years old last year when I met her,
p55
aVand she aspired to be a professional dancer.
p56
aVAnd during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,
p57
aVshe fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
p58
aVNow you would probably imagine, as she did,
p59
aVthat a wrist sprain is a trivial event
p60
aVin a person's life.
p61
aVWrap it in an ACE bandage,
p62
aVtake some ibuprofen for a week or two,
p63
aVand that's the end of the story.
p64
aVBut in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
p65
aVThis is what her arm looked like
p66
aVwhen she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.
p67
aVYou can see that the arm is discolored,
p68
aVpurplish in color.
p69
aVIt was cadaverically cold to the touch.
p70
aVThe muscles were frozen, paralyzed \u2014
p71
aVdystonic is how we refer to that.
p72
aVThe pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,
p73
aVto her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,
p74
aValmost all the way to her shoulder.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut the worst part was,
p77
aVnot the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.
p78
aVThe worst part was that she had allodynia,
p79
aVthe medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated
p80
aVwith the feather and with the torch.
p81
aVThe lightest touch of her arm \u2014
p82
aVthe touch of a hand,
p83
aVthe touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on \u2014
p84
aVcaused excruciating, burning pain.
p85
aa(lp86
VHow can the nervous system get this so wrong?
p87
aVHow can the nervous system
p88
aVmisinterpret an innocent sensation
p89
aVlike the touch of a hand
p90
aVand turn it into the malevolent sensation
p91
aVof the touch of the flame?
p92
aVWell you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body
p93
aVis hardwired like your house.
p94
aVIn your house, wires run in the wall,
p95
aVfrom the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling
p96
aVand from the junction box to the light bulb.
p97
aVAnd when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.
p98
aVAnd when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.
p99
aVSo people imagine the nervous system is just like that.
p100
aVIf you hit your thumb with a hammer,
p101
aVthese wires in your arm \u2014 that, of course, we call nerves \u2014
p102
aVtransmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord
p103
aVwhere new wires, new nerves,
p104
aVtake the information up to the brain
p105
aVwhere you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut the situation, of course, in the human body
p108
aVis far more complicated than that.
p109
aVInstead of it being the case
p110
aVthat that junction box in the spinal cord
p111
aVis just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve
p112
aVby releasing these little brown packets
p113
aVof chemical information called neurotransmitters
p114
aVin a linear one-on-one fashion,
p115
aVin fact, what happens
p116
aVis the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions \u2014
p117
aVlaterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord \u2014
p118
aVand they start interacting
p119
aVwith other adjacent cells.
p120
aVThese cells, called glial cells,
p121
aVwere once thought to be
p122
aVunimportant structural elements of the spinal cord
p123
aVthat did nothing more than hold all the important things together,
p124
aVlike the nerves.
p125
aVBut it turns out
p126
aVthe glial cells have a vital role
p127
aVin the modulation, amplification
p128
aVand, in the case of pain, the distortion
p129
aVof sensory experiences.
p130
aVThese glial cells become activated.
p131
aVTheir DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,
p132
aVwhich spill out
p133
aVand interact with adjacent nerves,
p134
aVand they start releasing their neurotransmitters,
p135
aVand those neurotransmitters spill out
p136
aVand activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,
p137
aVuntil what we have
p138
aVis a positive feedback loop.
p139
aa(lp140
VIt's almost as if somebody came into your home
p141
aVand rewired your walls
p142
aVso that the next time you turned on the light switch,
p143
aVthe toilet flushed three doors down,
p144
aVor your dishwasher went on,
p145
aVor your computer monitor turned off.
p146
aVThat's crazy,
p147
aVbut that's, in fact, what happens
p148
aVwith chronic pain.
p149
aVAnd that's why pain becomes its own disease.
p150
aVThe nervous system has plasticity.
p151
aVIt changes, and it morphs
p152
aVin response to stimuli.
p153
aa(lp154
VWell, what do we do about that?
p155
aVWhat can we do in a case like Chandler's?
p156
aVWe treat these patients in a rather crude fashion
p157
aVat this point in time.
p158
aVWe treat them with symptom-modifying drugs \u2014
p159
aVpainkillers \u2014
p160
aVwhich are, frankly, not very effective
p161
aVfor this kind of pain.
p162
aVWe take nerves that are noisy and active
p163
aVthat should be quiet,
p164
aVand we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.
p165
aVAnd most importantly, what we do
p166
aVis we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process
p167
aVof physical therapy and occupational therapy
p168
aVto retrain the nerves in the nervous system
p169
aVto respond normally
p170
aVto the activities and sensory experiences
p171
aVthat are part of everyday life.
p172
aVAnd we support all of that
p173
aVwith an intensive psychotherapy program
p174
aVto address the despondency, despair and depression
p175
aVthat always accompanies
p176
aVsevere, chronic pain.
p177
aa(lp178
VIt's successful,
p179
aVas you can see from this video of Chandler,
p180
aVwho, two months after we first met her,
p181
aVis now doings a back flip.
p182
aVAnd I had lunch with her yesterday
p183
aVbecause she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,
p184
aVand she's doing absolutely fantastic.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut the future is actually even brighter.
p187
aVThe future holds the promise
p188
aVthat new drugs will be developed
p189
aVthat are not symptom-modifying drugs
p190
aVthat simply mask the problem,
p191
aVas we have now,
p192
aVbut that will be disease-modifying drugs
p193
aVthat will actually go right to the root of the problem
p194
aVand attack those glial cells,
p195
aVor those pernicious proteins
p196
aVthat the glial cells elaborate,
p197
aVthat spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,
p198
aVor plasticity,
p199
aVthat so is capable
p200
aVof distorting and amplifying
p201
aVthe sensory experience that we call pain.
p202
aVSo I have hope
p203
aa(lp204
Vthat in the future,
p205
aVthe prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,
p206
aVwho said, "My philosophy:
p207
aVNo pain, no pain."
