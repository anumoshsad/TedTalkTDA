VTwenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read
p4
aVa newspaper article which said
p5
aVthat one day syringes would be
p6
aVone of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,
p7
aVthe transmission of AIDS.
p8
aVI thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.
p9
aa(lp10
VSadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,
p11
aVkills approximately one million people a year.
p12
aVThe reuse of syringes now exceeds that
p13
aVand kills 1.3 million people a year.
p14
aVThis young girl and her friend
p15
aVthat I met in an orphanage in Delhi
p16
aVwere HIV positive from a syringe.
p17
aVAnd what was so sad about this particular story
p18
aVwas that once their parents had found out \u2014
p19
aVand don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor \u2014
p20
aVthe parents threw them out on the street.
p21
aVAnd hence they ended up in an orphanage.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd it comes from situations like this where
p24
aVyou have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,
p25
aVblindly giving an injection to someone.
p26
aVAnd the injection is so valuable,
p27
aVthat the people basically trust
p28
aVthe doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,
p29
aVto do the right thing. But in fact they're not.
p30
aVAnd you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem
p31
aVbetween people in high-virus areas.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis video we took undercover,
p34
aVwhich shows you, over a half an hour period,
p35
aVa tray of medicines of 42 vials,
p36
aVwhich are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.
p37
aVAnd over the course of half an hour, not one syringe
p38
aVwas filmed being unwrapped.
p39
aVThey started with two and they ended with two.
p40
aVAnd you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,
p41
aVwhich is their sort of modular station,
p42
aVand dropping the syringe she's just used
p43
aVback in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.
p44
aVSo you can imagine the scale of this problem.
p45
aVAnd in fact in India alone, 62 percent
p46
aVof all injections given
p47
aVare unsafe.
p48
aa(lp49
VThese kids in Pakistan don't go to school.
p50
aVThey are lucky. They already have a job.
p51
aVAnd that job is that they go around and pick up syringes
p52
aVfrom the back of hospitals,
p53
aVwash them, and in the course of this,
p54
aVobviously picking them up they injure themselves.
p55
aVAnd then they repackage them and sell them out on markets
p56
aVfor literally more money
p57
aVthan a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.
p58
aVIn an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,
p59
aVpicked up a syringe and pricked his finger \u2014
p60
aVI don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end \u2014
p61
aVand immediately whipped out a box of matches,
p62
aVlit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,
p63
aVgiving me full assurance
p64
aVthat that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.
p65
aa(lp66
VIn China, recycling is a major issue.
p67
aVAnd they are collected en mass \u2014 you can see the scale of it here \u2014
p68
aVand sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,
p69
aVand then put back out on the street.
p70
aVSo recycling and reuse
p71
aVare the major issues here.
p72
aVBut there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.
p73
aVIn all schools in Indonesia,
p74
aVthere is usually a toy seller in the playground.
p75
aVThe toy seller, in this case,
p76
aVhad syringes, which they usually do,
p77
aVnext door to the diggers, which is obviously
p78
aVwhat you would expect.
p79
aVAnd they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.
p80
aVThey squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.
p81
aVAnd they are having great fun.
p82
aVBut they also drink from them
p83
aVwhile they're in their breaks, because it's hot.
p84
aVAnd they squirt the water into their mouths.
p85
aVAnd these are used with traces of blood visible.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo we need a better product. And we need better information.
p88
aVAnd I think, if I can just borrow this camera,
p89
aVI was going to show you my invention,
p90
aVwhich I came up with.
p91
aVSo, it's a normal-looking syringe.
p92
aVYou load it up in the normal way. This is made
p93
aVon existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.
p94
aVYou give the injection and then put it down.
p95
aVIf someone then tries to reuse it,
p96
aVit locks and breaks afterwards.
p97
aVIt's very, very simple. Thank you.
p98
aV(Applause)
p99
aVAnd it costs the same as a normal syringe.
p100
aVAnd in comparison, a Coca-Cola
p101
aVis 10 times the price.
p102
aVAnd that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd I have an information charity
p105
aVwhich has done huge scale amount of work in India.
p106
aVAnd we're very proud of giving information to people,
p107
aVso that little kids like this don't do stupid things.
p108
aVThank you very much.
