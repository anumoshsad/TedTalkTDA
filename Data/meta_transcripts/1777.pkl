VI do want to test this question we're all interested in:
p4
aVDoes extinction have to be forever?
p5
aa(lp6
VI'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
p7
aVOne is the Thylacine Project.
p8
aVThe other one is the Lazarus Project,
p9
aVand that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog.
p10
aVAnd it would be a fair question to ask,
p11
aVwhy have we focused on these two animals?
p12
aVWell, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own.
p13
aVWe've lost a whole family.
p14
aVThat's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
p15
aVI'd like it back.
p16
aVThe second reason is that we killed these things.
p17
aVIn the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw.
p18
aVWe slaughtered them.
p19
aVIn the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have "fungicided" it to death.
p20
aVThere's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world
p21
aVthat's called the chytrid fungus,
p22
aVand it's nailing frogs all over the world.
p23
aVWe think that's probably what got this frog,
p24
aVand humans are spreading this fungus.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd this introduces a very important ethical point,
p27
aVand I think you will have heard this many times
p28
aVwhen this topic comes up.
p29
aVWhat I think is important
p30
aVis that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species,
p31
aVthen I think we not only have a moral obligation
p32
aVto see what we can do about it,
p33
aVbut I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can.
p34
aa(lp35
VOK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
p36
aVIt's a frog. And you think, frog.
p37
aVYeah, but this was not just any frog.
p38
aVUnlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water
p39
aVand goes away and wishes its froglets well,
p40
aVthis frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,
p41
aVswallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food,
p42
aVdidn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus.
p43
aVIn the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles,
p44
aVand in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs,
p45
aVand they grew in the stomach
p46
aVuntil eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart.
p47
aVIt has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, when biologists saw this, they were agog.
p50
aVThey thought, this is incredible.
p51
aVNo animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this,
p52
aVto change one organ in the body into another.
p53
aVAnd you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
p54
aVIf we could understand
p55
aVhow that frog is managing the way its tummy works,
p56
aVis there information here that we need to understand
p57
aVor could usefully use to help ourselves?
p58
aVNow, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach,
p59
aVbut I am suggesting it's possible
p60
aVwe might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut.
p61
aVAnd just as everybody got excited about it, bang!
p62
aVIt was extinct.
p63
aa(lp64
VI called up my friend,
p65
aVProfessor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
p66
aVHe was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab.
p67
aVAnd I said, "Mike, by any chance \u2014" This was 30 or 40 years ago.
p68
aV"By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"
p69
aVAnd he thought about it,
p70
aVand he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade,
p71
aVand he poured through everything in the freezer,
p72
aVand there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis was very exciting,
p75
aVbut there was no reason why we should expect that this would work,
p76
aVbecause this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it,
p77
aVcryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen.
p78
aVAnd normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands,
p79
aVand the same thing happens in a cell.
p80
aVIf you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls.
p81
aVWell, we looked at the tissue under the microscope.
p82
aVIt actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact.
p83
aVSo we thought, let's give it a go.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhat we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
p86
aVWe took the eggs of a related species, a living frog,
p87
aVand we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.
p88
aVWe used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
p89
aVAnd then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog
p90
aVand we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
p91
aVNow, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,
p92
aVlike what produced Dolly,
p93
aVbut it's actually very different,
p94
aVbecause Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells.
p95
aVThat was a miracle, but it was workable.
p96
aVWhat we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species
p97
aVand put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
p98
aVWell, we had no real reason to expect it would,
p99
aVand we tried hundreds and hundreds of these.
p100
aVAnd just last February, the last time we did these trials,
p101
aa(lp102
VI saw a miracle starting to happen.
p103
aVWhat we found was most of these eggs didn't work,
p104
aVbut then suddenly, one of them began to divide.
p105
aVThat was so exciting.
p106
aVAnd then the egg divided again. And then again.
p107
aVAnd pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos
p108
aVwith hundreds of cells forming those.
p109
aVWe even DNA-tested some of these cells,
p110
aVand the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells.
p111
aVSo we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.
p112
aVBut it's a long way along the journey
p113
aVto producing, or bringing back, an extinct species.
p114
aVAnd this is news.
p115
aVWe haven't announced this publicly before.
p116
aVWe're excited.
p117
aVWe've got to get past this point.
p118
aVWe now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate,
p119
aVto turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.
p120
aVIt'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
p121
aVWatch this space.
p122
aVI think we're going to have this frog hopping
p123
aVglad to be back in the world again.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VWe haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
p134
aVThe thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog,
p135
aVor maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.
p136
aVBut it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.
p137
aVIt raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do,
p138
aVand it has a long history, a long, fascinating history,
p139
aVthat goes back 25 million years.
p140
aVBut it's also a tragic history.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia
p143
aVabout 25 million years ago,
p144
aVand the National Geographic Society
p145
aVis helping us to explore these fossil deposits.
p146
aVThis is Riversleigh.
p147
aVIn those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.
p148
aVWe found marsupial lions.
p149
aVWe found carnivorous kangaroos.
p150
aVIt's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo,
p151
aVbut these are meat-eating kangaroos.
p152
aVWe found the biggest bird in the world,
p153
aVbigger than that thing that was in Madagascar,
p154
aVand it too was a flesh eater.
p155
aVIt was a giant, weird duck.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.
p158
aVYou think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing,
p159
aVsitting in a pool of water.
p160
aVThese crocodiles were actually out on the land
p161
aVand they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.
p162
aVWe had, in Australia, drop crocs. They really do exist.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VBut what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals
p167
aVbut also thylacines.
p168
aVThere were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests,
p169
aVand they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones
p170
aVto one that was about the size of a chihuahua.
p171
aVParis Hilton would have been able
p172
aVto carry one of these things around in a little handbag,
p173
aVuntil a drop croc landed on her.
p174
aa(lp175
VAt any rate, it was a fascinating place,
p176
aVbut unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way.
p177
aVClimate change has affected the world for a long period of time,
p178
aVand gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out,
p179
aVand the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline,
p180
aVuntil by five million years ago,
p181
aVonly one left.
p182
aVBy 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea,
p183
aVand unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was,
p184
aVintroduced dingoes \u2014 this is a very archaic kind of a dog \u2014
p185
aVinto Australia.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd as you can see,
p188
aVdingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines.
p189
aVThat similarity meant they probably competed.
p190
aVThey were eating the same kinds of foods.
p191
aVIt's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets,
p192
aVand therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival.
p193
aVAll we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in,
p194
aVthylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland,
p195
aVand after that they only survived in Tasmania.
p196
aa(lp197
VThen, unfortunately,
p198
aVthe next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788,
p199
aVand they brought with them the things they valued,
p200
aVand that included sheep.
p201
aVThey took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania,
p202
aVand they thought, hang on, this is not going to work.
p203
aVThat guy is going to eat all our sheep.
p204
aVThat was not what happened, actually.
p205
aVWild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap.
p206
aVBut immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them,
p207
aVand they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw.
p208
aVBy the early 1930s,
p209
aV3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered.
p210
aVIt was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall.
p211
aa(lp212
VHave a look at this bit of film footage.
p213
aVIt makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal,
p214
aVand it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it
p215
aVbefore it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction,
p216
aVwe didn't, unfortunately, at this same time,
p217
aVhave a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species.
p218
aVThese are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin,
p219
aVwho was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.
p220
aVTo add insult to injury,
p221
aVhaving swept this species nearly off the table,
p222
aVthis animal, when it died of neglect \u2014
p223
aVThe keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
p224
aVIt died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin,
p225
aVthey still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump.
p226
aa(lp227
VDoes it have to stay this way?
p228
aVIn 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.
p229
aVI was fascinated by thylacines.
p230
aVI've always been obsessed with these animals.
p231
aVAnd I was studying skulls,
p232
aVtrying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals,
p233
aVand I saw this jar,
p234
aVand here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup,
p235
aVperhaps six months old.
p236
aVThe guy who had found it and killed the mother
p237
aVhad pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol.
p238
aVI'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends,
p241
aVcouldn't we think about going into this pup
p242
aVand extracting DNA, if it's there,
p243
aVand then somewhere down the line in the future,
p244
aVwe'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?
p245
aVThe geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly.
p246
aVCloning was science fiction.
p247
aVIt had not happened.
p248
aVBut then suddenly cloning did happen.
p249
aVAnd I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,
p250
aVI'm going to give this a go.
p251
aa(lp252
VI put a team together.
p253
aVWe went into that pup to see what was in it,
p254
aVand we did find thylacine DNA.
p255
aVIt was a eureka moment. We were very excited.
p256
aVUnfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA.
p257
aVEvery old curator who'd been in that museum
p258
aVhad seen this wonderful specimen,
p259
aVput their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,
p260
aV"Wow, look at that," plop, dropped it back in the jar,
p261
aVcontaminating this specimen.
p262
aVAnd that was a worry.
p263
aVIf the goal here was to get the DNA out
p264
aVand use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back,
p265
aVwhat we didn't want happening
p266
aVwhen the information was shoved into the machine
p267
aVand the wheel turned around and the lights flashed,
p268
aVwas to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine.
p269
aVIt would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo we went back to these specimens and we started digging around,
p272
aVand particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls,
p273
aVhard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers,
p274
aVand we found much better quality DNA.
p275
aVWe found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
p276
aVIt's there. So we got it.
p277
aa(lp278
VOK. What could we do with this stuff?
p279
aVWell, George Church, in his book, "Regenesis,"
p280
aVhas mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing
p281
aVto work with fragmented DNA.
p282
aVWe would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form,
p283
aVand then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project,
p284
aVget that stuff into an egg of a host species.
p285
aVIt has to be a different species. What could it be?
p286
aVWhy couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
p287
aVThey're related, distantly, to thylacines.
p288
aVAnd then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
p289
aa(lp290
VCritics of this project say, hang on.
p291
aVThylacine, Tasmanian devil? That's going to hurt.
p292
aVNo, it's not. These are marsupials.
p293
aVThey give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
p294
aVThat Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
p295
aVIt is, shortly, going to think
p296
aVit's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world,
p297
aVso maybe it'll need some help to keep it going.
p298
aa(lp299
VAndrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated
p300
aVthis might not be a waste of time.
p301
aVAnd it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet,
p302
aVbut it's the kind of thing we want to think about.
p303
aVThey took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA
p304
aVand they spliced it into a mouse genome,
p305
aVbut they put a tag on it
p306
aVso that anything that this thylacine DNA produced
p307
aVwould appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
p308
aVIn other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA,
p309
aVit would be able to be recognized.
p310
aVWhen the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues.
p311
aVAnd that tells us if we can get that genome back together,
p312
aVget it into a live cell,
p313
aVit's going to produce thylacine stuff.
p314
aa(lp315
VIs this a risk?
p316
aVYou've taken the bits of one animal
p317
aVand you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
p318
aVAre we going to get a Frankenstein? Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
p319
aVAnd the answer is no.
p320
aVIf the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,
p321
aVthat's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil.
p322
aa(lp323
VOK, if we can do this, could we put it back?
p324
aVThis is a key question for everybody.
p325
aVDoes it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
p326
aVCould we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania,
p327
aVrestore that ecosystem?
p328
aVOr has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
p329
aVI've been to Tasmania.
p330
aVI've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
p331
aVI've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here,
p332
aVwho when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,
p333
aVbut in 1926, this man and his father and his brother
p334
aVcaught thylacines.
p335
aVThey trapped them.
p336
aVAnd when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,
p337
aV"Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like,
p338
aVwhat they smelled like, what they sounded like."
p339
aVHe led them around on a rope.
p340
aVHe has personal experiences
p341
aVthat I would give my left leg to have in my head.
p342
aVWe'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
p343
aVAnyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,
p344
aVcould he take us back to where he caught those thylacines.
p345
aVMy interest was in whether the environment had changed.
p346
aVHe thought hard. It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
p347
aa(lp348
VAt any rate, he led us down this bush track,
p349
aVand there, right where he remembered,
p350
aVwas the hut,
p351
aVand tears came into his eyes.
p352
aVHe looked at the hut. We went inside.
p353
aVThere were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut
p354
aVwhere he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
p355
aVAnd he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories.
p356
aVHe said, "I remember the thylacines going around the hut
p357
aVwondering what was inside,"
p358
aVand he said they made sounds like "Yip! Yip! Yip!"
p359
aVAll of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
p360
aVAnd the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?
p361
aVAnd he said no.
p362
aVThe southern beech forests surrounded his hut
p363
aVjust like it was when he was there in 1926.
p364
aVThe grasslands were sweeping away.
p365
aVThat's classic thylacine habitat.
p366
aVAnd the animals in those areas were the same that were there
p367
aVwhen the thylacine was around.
p368
aVSo could we put it back? Yes.
p369
aa(lp370
VIs that all we would do? And this is an interesting question.
p371
aVSometimes you might be able to put it back,
p372
aVbut is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?
p373
aVAnd I don't think so.
p374
aVI think gradually, as we see species all around the world,
p375
aVit's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild.
p376
aVWe'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't.
p377
aVWe need other parallel strategies coming online.
p378
aVAnd this one interests me.
p379
aVSome of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos,
p380
aVsanctuaries, even at the museums,
p381
aVhad collar marks on the neck.
p382
aVThey were being kept as pets,
p383
aVand we know a lot of bush tales and memories
p384
aVof people who had them as pets,
p385
aVand they say they were wonderful, friendly.
p386
aVThis particular one
p387
aVcame in out of the forest to lick this boy
p388
aVand curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
p389
aVA wild animal.
p390
aa(lp391
VAnd I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this.
p392
aVIf it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then,
p393
aVwould the thylacine be extinct now?
p394
aVAnd I'm positive it wouldn't.
p395
aVWe need to think about this in today's world.
p396
aVCould it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them,
p397
aVmaybe they won't go extinct?
p398
aVAnd this is such a critical issue for us
p399
aVbecause if we don't do that,
p400
aVwe're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice.
p401
aa(lp402
VAs far as I'm concerned,
p403
aVthis is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects.
p404
aVWe are trying to restore that balance of nature
p405
aVthat we have upset.
