VTake a look at this drawing.
p4
aVCan you tell what it is?
p5
aVI'm a molecular biologist by training,
p6
aVand I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.
p7
aVThey're usually referred to as a model figure,
p8
aVa drawing that shows how we think
p9
aVa cellular or molecular process occurs.
p10
aVThis particular drawing is of a process
p11
aVcalled clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
p12
aVIt's a process by which a molecule can get
p13
aVfrom the outside of the cell to the inside
p14
aVby getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle
p15
aVthat then gets internalized by the cell.
p16
aVThere's a problem with this drawing, though,
p17
aVand it's mainly in what it doesn't show.
p18
aVFrom lots of experiments,
p19
aVfrom lots of different scientists,
p20
aVwe know a lot about what these molecules look like,
p21
aVhow they move around in the cell,
p22
aVand that this is all taking place
p23
aVin an incredibly dynamic environment.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen,
p26
aVwe decided to create a new kind of model figure
p27
aVthat showed all of that.
p28
aVSo we start outside of the cell.
p29
aVNow we're looking inside.
p30
aVClathrin are these three-legged molecules
p31
aVthat can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.
p32
aVThrough connections with a membrane,
p33
aVclathrin is able to deform the membrane
p34
aVand form this sort of a cup
p35
aVthat forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,
p36
aVthat's now capturing some of the proteins
p37
aVthat were outside of the cell.
p38
aVProteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle,
p39
aVmaking it separate from the rest of the membrane,
p40
aVand now clathrin is basically done with its job,
p41
aVand so proteins are coming in now \u2014
p42
aVwe've covered them yellow and orange \u2014
p43
aVthat are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.
p44
aVAnd so all of these proteins can get basically recycled
p45
aVand used all over again.
p46
aa(lp47
VThese processes are too small to be seen directly,
p48
aVeven with the best microscopes,
p49
aVso animations like this provide a really powerful way
p50
aVof visualizing a hypothesis.
p51
aa(lp52
VHere's another illustration,
p53
aVand this is a drawing of how a researcher might think
p54
aVthat the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.
p55
aVAnd again, this is a vast oversimplification
p56
aVand doesn't begin to show
p57
aVwhat we actually know about these processes.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou might be surprised to know
p60
aVthat these simple drawings are the only way
p61
aVthat most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses.
p62
aVWhy?
p63
aVBecause creating movies of processes
p64
aVas we think they actually occur is really hard.
p65
aVI spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software,
p66
aVand I spend months on each animation,
p67
aVand that's just time that most researchers can't afford.
p68
aVThe payoffs can be huge, though.
p69
aVMolecular animations are unparalleled
p70
aVin their ability to convey a great deal of information
p71
aVto broad audiences with extreme accuracy.
p72
aVAnd I'm working on a new project now
p73
aVcalled "The Science of HIV"
p74
aVwhere I'll be animating the entire life cycle
p75
aVof the HIV virus as accurately as possible
p76
aVand all in molecular detail.
p77
aVThe animation will feature data
p78
aVfrom thousands of researchers collected over decades,
p79
aVdata on what this virus looks like,
p80
aVhow it's able to infect cells in our body,
p81
aVand how therapeutics are helping to combat infection.
p82
aa(lp83
VOver the years, I found that animations
p84
aVaren't just useful for communicating an idea,
p85
aVbut they're also really useful
p86
aVfor exploring a hypothesis.
p87
aVBiologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil
p88
aVto visualize the processes they study,
p89
aVand with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore.
p90
aVThe process of creating an animation
p91
aVcan act as a catalyst that allows researchers
p92
aVto crystalize and refine their own ideas.
p93
aVOne researcher I worked with
p94
aVwho works on the molecular mechanisms
p95
aVof neurodegenerative diseases
p96
aVcame up with experiments that were related
p97
aVdirectly to the animation that she and I worked on together,
p98
aVand in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.
p99
aa(lp100
VI believe that animation can change biology.
p101
aVIt can change the way that we communicate with one another,
p102
aVhow we explore our data
p103
aVand how we teach our students.
p104
aVBut for that change to happen,
p105
aVwe need more researchers creating animations,
p106
aVand toward that end, I brought together a team
p107
aVof biologists, animators and programmers
p108
aVto create a new, free, open-source software \u2014
p109
aVwe call it Molecular Flipbook \u2014
p110
aVthat's created just for biologists
p111
aVjust to create molecular animations.
p112
aVFrom our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes
p113
aVfor a biologist who has never touched animation software before
p114
aVto create her first molecular animation
p115
aVof her own hypothesis.
p116
aVWe're also building an online database
p117
aVwhere anyone can view, download and contribute
p118
aVtheir own animations.
p119
aVWe're really excited to announce
p120
aVthat the beta version of the molecular animation
p121
aVsoftware toolkit will be available for download today.
p122
aVWe are really excited to see what biologists will create with it
p123
aVand what new insights they're able to gain
p124
aVfrom finally being able to animate
p125
aVtheir own model figures.
