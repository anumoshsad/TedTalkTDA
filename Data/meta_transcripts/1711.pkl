VI want to share some personal friends and stories with you
p4
aVthat I've actually never talked about in public before
p5
aVto help illustrate the idea
p6
aVand the need and the hope
p7
aVfor us to reinvent our health care system around the world.
p8
aVTwenty-four years ago, I had \u2014 a sophomore in college,
p9
aVI had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.
p10
aVAnd I ended up in student health,
p11
aVand they ran some labwork and came back right away,
p12
aVand said, "Kidney problems."
p13
aVAnd before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into
p14
aVthis six months of tests and trials and tribulations
p15
aVwith six doctors across two hospitals
p16
aVin this clash of medical titans
p17
aVto figure out which one of them was right
p18
aVabout what was wrong with me.
p19
aVAnd I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,
p20
aVand all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,
p21
aVand I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news."
p22
aVAnd their diagnosis was this:
p23
aVThey said, "You have two rare kidney diseases
p24
aVthat are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,
p25
aVyou have cancer-like cells in your immune system
p26
aVthat we need to start treatment right away,
p27
aVand you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,
p28
aVand you're not likely to live more than two or three years."
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,
p31
aVit just sucked me in immediately,
p32
aVas if I began preparing myself as a patient
p33
aVto die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,
p34
aVuntil I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,
p35
aVwho became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day
p36
aVand took me off to the medical library
p37
aVand did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,
p38
aVand said, "Eric, these people who get this
p39
aVare normally in their '70s and '80s.
p40
aVThey don't know anything about you. Wake up.
p41
aVTake control of your health and get on with your life."
p42
aVAnd I did.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, these people making these proclamations to me
p45
aVwere not bad people.
p46
aVIn fact, these professionals were miracle workers,
p47
aVbut they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.
p48
aVIt's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.
p49
aVIt's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.
p50
aVIt's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,
p51
aVand so something either works or you die.
p52
aVAnd it's dependent on passive patients
p53
aVwho just take it and don't ask any questions.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow the problem with this model
p56
aVis that it's unsustainable globally.
p57
aVIt's unaffordable globally.
p58
aVWe need to invent what I call a personal health system.
p59
aVSo what does this personal health system look like,
p60
aVand what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you
p63
aVa new friend of mine, Libby,
p64
aVsomebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.
p65
aVThis is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.
p66
aVThis is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.
p67
aVNow, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,
p68
aVand you'll notice, on the edge of this image,
p69
aVthere's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.
p70
aVSo we're going to actually do a live exam
p71
aVto sort of see how Libby's doing.
p72
aVThis is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.
p73
aVDon't you in the front row worry or anything.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVI'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.
p76
aVThis is a portable ultrasound.
p77
aVIt can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.
p78
aVMobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,
p79
aVand they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.
p80
aVThey're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.
p81
aVThis is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.
p82
aVAll right, I gotta gel up.
p83
aVNow the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,
p86
aVwho's another friend of mine.
p87
aVHe's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.
p88
aVSo let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?
p89
aVAnd actually, can you see Libby?
p90
aa(lp91
VThomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.
p92
aVYou look busy. How are you?
p93
aa(lp94
VEric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off
p95
aVin front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.
p96
aVSo I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?
p97
aVAnd I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there.
p98
aa(lp99
VTB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,
p100
aVgive me a lay of the land.
p101
aa(lp102
VED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,
p103
aVa little bit toward the middle for me.
p104
aVOkay, that's good. How about up a little bit?
p105
aVOkay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me.
p106
aa(lp107
VED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,
p108
aVyou had me measure that spot to the right.
p109
aVShould I do that again?
p110
aa(lp111
VTB: Yeah, let's do that.
p112
aa(lp113
VED: All right. This is kind of hard to do
p114
aVwith one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,
p115
aVbut I've got it, I think,
p116
aVand I'll save that image and send it to you.
p117
aVSo tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.
p118
aVIt's not something I was very happy about.
p119
aa(lp120
VTB: Many people after a kidney transplant
p121
aVwill develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.
p122
aVMost of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,
p123
aVbut it does warrant looking at,
p124
aVso I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,
p125
aVmake sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.
p126
aVBased on the other images we have,
p127
aVI'm really happy how it looks today.
p128
aa(lp129
VED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.
p130
aVI've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,
p131
aVand I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,
p132
aVbecause I don't think I can do that one on myself.
p133
aa(lp134
VTB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.
p135
aVAll right. So what you're sort of seeing here
p136
aVis an example of disruptive technologies,
p137
aVof mobile, social and analytic technologies.
p138
aVThese are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow there's really three pillars
p141
aVof this personal health I want to talk to you about now,
p142
aVand it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.
p143
aVAnd you just saw a little bit of the first two
p144
aVwith my interaction with Dr. Batiuk.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo let's start with care anywhere.
p147
aVHumans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics
p148
aVin the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.
p149
aVWe have got to untether clinicians and patients
p150
aVfrom the notion of traveling to a special
p151
aVbricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,
p152
aVbecause these places are often the wrong tool,
p153
aVand the most expensive tool, for the job.
p154
aVAnd these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,
p155
aVespecially in an era of superbugs
p156
aVand hospital-acquired infections.
p157
aVAnd many countries are going to go brickless from the start
p158
aVbecause they're never going to be able to afford
p159
aVthe mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.
p160
aVNow I personally learned that hospitals
p161
aVcan be a very dangerous place at a young age.
p162
aVThis was me in third grade.
p163
aVI broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,
p164
aVworried that they were going to actually lose the arm.
p165
aVRecovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.
p166
aVThose bedsores become infected,
p167
aVand they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,
p168
aVand now my whole body breaks out,
p169
aVand now all of those become infected.
p170
aVThe longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,
p171
aVand the more expensive it became,
p172
aVand this happens to millions of people around the world every year.
p173
aVThe future of personal health that I'm talking about
p174
aVsays care must occur at home as the default model,
p175
aVnot in a hospital or clinic.
p176
aVYou have to earn your way into those places
p177
aVby being sick enough to use that tool for the job.
p178
aVNow the smartphones that we're already carrying
p179
aVcan clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,
p180
aVand a whole array of others, today,
p181
aVand as sensing is built into these,
p182
aVwe'll be able to do vital signs monitor
p183
aVand behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.
p184
aVMany of us will have implantables that will actually look
p185
aVreal-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry
p186
aVand in our proteins right now.
p187
aVNow the software is also getting smarter, right?
p188
aVThink about a coach, an agent online,
p189
aVthat's going to help me do safe self-care.
p190
aVThat same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound
p191
aVwill likely have real-time image processing,
p192
aVand the device will say, "Up, down, left, right,
p193
aVah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image
p194
aVoff to your doctor."
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, if we've got all these networked devices
p197
aVthat are helping us to do care anywhere,
p198
aVit stands to reason that we also need a team
p199
aVto be able to interact with all of that stuff,
p200
aVand that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,
p201
aVcare networking.
p202
aVWe have got to go beyond this paradigm
p203
aVof isolated specialists doing parts care
p204
aVto multidisciplinary teams doing person care.
p205
aVUncoordinated care today is expensive at best,
p206
aVand it is deadly at worst.
p207
aVEighty percent of medical errors are actually caused
p208
aVby communication and coordination problems
p209
aVamongst medical team members.
p210
aVI had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,
p211
aVwhen we're under treatment for the kidney,
p212
aVand suddenly, they're like, "Oh, we think you have a heart problem."
p213
aVAnd I have these palpitations that are showing up.
p214
aVThey put me through five weeks of tests \u2014
p215
aVvery expensive, very scary \u2014 before the nurse finally notices
p216
aVthe piece of the paper, my meds list
p217
aVthat I've been carrying to every single appointment,
p218
aVand says, "Oh my gosh."
p219
aVThree different specialists had prescribed
p220
aVthree different versions of the same drug to me.
p221
aVI did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.
p222
aVI had a care coordination problem.
p223
aVAnd this happens to millions of people every year.
p224
aVI want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen
p225
aVto make health care a coordinated team sport.
p226
aVNow this is the most frightening thing to me.
p227
aVOut of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,
p228
aVthe first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience
p229
aVwas at Legacy Good Sam these last six months
p230
aVfor me to go get this.
p231
aVAnd this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.
p232
aVThere's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.
p233
aVWe just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,
p234
aVAllison, who helped manage the transplant list,
p235
aVand a dozen other people who aren't pictured,
p236
aVa pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,
p237
aVeven a financial counselor, Lisa,
p238
aVwho helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.
p239
aVI wept the day I graduated.
p240
aVI should have been happy, because I was so well
p241
aVthat I could go back to my normal doctors,
p242
aVbut I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd here's the most important part.
p245
aVThe other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.
p246
aVLegacy trained us on how to do care for me at home
p247
aVso that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.
p248
aVThat's the only way that the model works.
p249
aVMy team is actually working in China
p250
aVon one of these self-care models
p251
aVfor a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.
p252
aVWe're trying to help build a social network
p253
aVthat can help track and train the care of seniors
p254
aVcaring for themselves
p255
aVas well as the care provided by their family members
p256
aVor volunteer community health workers,
p257
aVas well as have an exchange network online,
p258
aVwhere, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,
p259
aVif somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,
p260
aVand we exchange all of that online.
p261
aVThe most important point I want to make to you about this
p262
aVis the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized
p263
aVdoctor-patient one-on-one
p264
aVis a relic of the past.
p265
aVThe future of health care is smart teams,
p266
aVand you'd better be on that team for yourself.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, the last thing that I want to talk to you about
p269
aVis care customization,
p270
aVbecause if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,
p271
aVthose are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,
p272
aVbut there's still too much guesswork.
p273
aVRandomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948
p274
aVto help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,
p275
aVand those are important things, don't get me wrong.
p276
aVThese population studies that we've done have created
p277
aVtons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,
p278
aVbut the problem is that health care
p279
aVis treating us as averages, not unique individuals,
p280
aVbecause at the end of the day,
p281
aVthe patient is not the same thing as the population
p282
aVwho are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.
p283
aVThe technologies that are coming,
p284
aVhigh-performance computing, analytics,
p285
aVbig data that everyone's talking about,
p286
aVwill allow us to build predictive models for each of us
p287
aVas individual patients.
p288
aVAnd the magic here is, experiment on my avatar
p289
aVin software, not my body in suffering.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you
p292
aVof this kind of care customization on my own journey.
p293
aVThe first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago
p294
aVthat all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.
p295
aVIt's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.
p296
aVI was optimizing my life for quality of life,
p297
aVand quality of life for me means time in snow.
p298
aVSo on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal:
p299
aVlow doses of drugs over longer periods of time,
p300
aVside effects friendly to skiing."
p301
aVAnd I think that's why I achieved longevity.
p302
aVI think that time-in-snow therapy was as important
p303
aVas the pharmaceuticals that I had.
p304
aVNow the second example of customization \u2014 and by the way,
p305
aVyou can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,
p306
aVso health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.
p307
aVBut the second example I want to give you is,
p308
aVI happened to be an early guinea pig,
p309
aVand I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.
p310
aVNow it took about two weeks of processing
p311
aVon Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,
p312
aVand another six months of human and computing labor
p313
aVto make sense of all of that data.
p314
aVAnd at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes,
p315
aVthose diagnoses of that clash of medical titans
p316
aVall of those years ago were wrong,
p317
aVand we have a better path forward."
p318
aVThe future that Intel's working on now is to figure out
p319
aVhow to make that computing for personalized medicine
p320
aVgo from months and weeks to even hours,
p321
aVand make this kind of tool available,
p322
aVnot just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,
p323
aVbut in the mainstream \u2014 every patient, every clinic
p324
aVwith access to whole genome sequencing.
p325
aVAnd I tell you, this kind of care customization
p326
aVfor everything from your goals to your genetics
p327
aVwill be the most game-changing transformation
p328
aVthat we witness in health care during our lifetime.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo these three pillars of personal health,
p331
aVcare anywhere, care networking, care customization,
p332
aVare happening in pieces now,
p333
aVbut this vision will completely fail if we don't step up
p334
aVas caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.
p335
aVIt's what my friend Verna said:
p336
aVWake up and take control of your health.
p337
aVBecause at the end of the day these technologies
p338
aVare simply about people caring for other people
p339
aVand ourselves in some powerful new ways.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you
p342
aVto one last friend, very quickly.
p343
aVTracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney
p344
aVthat I was never supposed to have.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VSo Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.
p349
aa(lp350
VTracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.
p351
aVI only had one night in the hospital.
p352
aVThe surgery was done laparoscopically,
p353
aVso I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,
p354
aVand I had four weeks away from work
p355
aVand went back to doing everything I'd done before
p356
aVwithout any changes.
p357
aa(lp358
VED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you
p359
aVin such a large audience ever again.
p360
aVSo "thank you" feel likes a really trite word,
p361
aVbut thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VThis TED stage and all of the TED stages
p366
aVare often about celebrating innovation
p367
aVand celebrating new technologies,
p368
aVand I've done that here today,
p369
aVand I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,
p370
aVI mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.
p371
aVBut until such time that these amazing technologies
p372
aVare available to all of us, and even when they are,
p373
aVit's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.
p374
aVI hope you will go out and make personal health happen
p375
aVfor yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.
