VI'd like to try something new.
p4
aVThose of you who are able,
p5
aVplease stand up.
p6
aVOK, so I'm going to name some names.
p7
aVWhen you hear a name that you don't recognize,
p8
aVyou can't tell me anything about them,
p9
aVI'd like you to take a seat
p10
aVand stay seated.
p11
aVThe last person standing, we're going to see what they know. OK?
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAll right.
p16
aVEric Garner.
p17
aVMike Brown.
p18
aVTamir Rice.
p19
aVFreddie Gray.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo those of you who are still standing,
p22
aVI'd like you to turn around and take a look.
p23
aVI'd say half to most of the people are still standing.
p24
aVSo let's continue.
p25
aa(lp26
VMichelle Cusseaux.
p27
aVTanisha Anderson.
p28
aVAura Rosser.
p29
aVMeagan Hockaday.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo if we look around again,
p32
aVthere are about four people still standing,
p33
aVand actually I'm not going to put you on the spot.
p34
aVI just say that to encourage transparency, so you can be seated.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo those of you who recognized the first group of names know
p39
aVthat these were African-Americans who have been killed by the police
p40
aVover the last two and a half years.
p41
aVWhat you may not know
p42
aVis that the other list is also African-Americans
p43
aVwho have been killed within the last two years.
p44
aVOnly one thing distinguishes the names that you know
p45
aVfrom the names that you don't know:
p46
aVgender.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo let me first let you know that there's nothing at all distinct
p49
aVabout this audience
p50
aVthat explains the pattern of recognition that we've just seen.
p51
aVI've done this exercise dozens of times around the country.
p52
aVI've done it to women's rights organizations.
p53
aVI've done it with civil rights groups.
p54
aVI've done it with professors. I've done it with students.
p55
aVI've done it with psychologists. I've done it with sociologists.
p56
aVI've done it even with progressive members of Congress.
p57
aVAnd everywhere, the awareness of the level of police violence
p58
aVthat black women experience
p59
aVis exceedingly low.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, it is surprising, isn't it, that this would be the case.
p62
aVI mean, there are two issues involved here.
p63
aVThere's police violence against African-Americans,
p64
aVand there's violence against women,
p65
aVtwo issues that have been talked about a lot lately.
p66
aVBut when we think about who is implicated by these problems,
p67
aVwhen we think about who is victimized by these problems,
p68
aVthe names of these black women never come to mind.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, communications experts tell us
p71
aVthat when facts do not fit with the available frames,
p72
aVpeople have a difficult time incorporating new facts
p73
aVinto their way of thinking about a problem.
p74
aVThese women's names have slipped through our consciousness
p75
aVbecause there are no frames for us to see them,
p76
aVno frames for us to remember them,
p77
aVno frames for us to hold them.
p78
aVAs a consequence,
p79
aVreporters don't lead with them,
p80
aVpolicymakers don't think about them,
p81
aVand politicians aren't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, you might ask,
p84
aVwhy does a frame matter?
p85
aVI mean, after all,
p86
aVan issue that affects black people and an issue that affects women,
p87
aVwouldn't that necessarily include black people who are women
p88
aVand women who are black people?
p89
aVWell, the simple answer is that this is a trickle-down approach to social justice,
p90
aVand many times it just doesn't work.
p91
aVWithout frames that allow us to see
p92
aVhow social problems impact all the members of a targeted group,
p93
aVmany will fall through the cracks of our movements,
p94
aVleft to suffer in virtual isolation.
p95
aVBut it doesn't have to be this way.
p96
aa(lp97
VMany years ago, I began to use the term "intersectionality"
p98
aVto deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems
p99
aVlike racism and sexism
p100
aVare often overlapping,
p101
aVcreating multiple levels of social injustice.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, the experience that gave rise to intersectionality
p104
aVwas my chance encounter with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.
p105
aVEmma DeGraffenreid was an African-American woman,
p106
aVa working wife and a mother.
p107
aVI actually read about Emma's story from the pages of a legal opinion
p108
aVwritten by a judge who had dismissed Emma's claim
p109
aVof race and gender discrimination
p110
aVagainst a local car manufacturing plant.
p111
aVEmma, like so many African-American women,
p112
aVsought better employment for her family and for others.
p113
aVShe wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family.
p114
aVBut she applied for a job,
p115
aVand she was not hired,
p116
aVand she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, the judge in question dismissed Emma's suit,
p119
aVand the argument for dismissing the suit was
p120
aVthat the employer did hire African-Americans
p121
aVand the employer hired women.
p122
aVThe real problem, though, that the judge was not willing to acknowledge
p123
aVwas what Emma was actually trying to say,
p124
aVthat the African-Americans that were hired,
p125
aVusually for industrial jobs, maintenance jobs, were all men.
p126
aVAnd the women that were hired,
p127
aVusually for secretarial or front-office work,
p128
aVwere all white.
p129
aVOnly if the court was able to see how these policies came together
p130
aVwould he be able to see the double discrimination
p131
aVthat Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.
p132
aVBut the court refused to allow Emma to put two causes of action together
p133
aVto tell her story
p134
aVbecause he believed that, by allowing her to do that,
p135
aVshe would be able to have preferential treatment.
p136
aVShe would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat,
p137
aVwhen African-American men and white women only had one swing at the bat.
p138
aVBut of course, neither African-American men or white women
p139
aVneeded to combine a race and gender discrimination claim
p140
aVto tell the story of the discrimination they were experiencing.
p141
aVWhy wasn't the real unfairness
p142
aVlaw's refusal to protect African-American women
p143
aVsimply because their experiences weren't exactly the same
p144
aVas white women and African-American men?
p145
aVRather than broadening the frame to include African-American women,
p146
aVthe court simply tossed their case completely out of court.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, as a student of antidiscrimination law,
p149
aVas a feminist,
p150
aVas an antiracist,
p151
aVI was struck by this case.
p152
aVIt felt to me like injustice squared.
p153
aVSo first of all,
p154
aVblack women weren't allowed to work at the plant.
p155
aVSecond of all, the court doubled down on this exclusion
p156
aVby making it legally inconsequential.
p157
aVAnd to boot, there was no name for this problem.
p158
aVAnd we all know that, where there's no name for a problem,
p159
aVyou can't see a problem,
p160
aVand when you can't see a problem, you pretty much can't solve it.
p161
aa(lp162
VMany years later, I had come to recognize
p163
aVthat the problem that Emma was facing was a framing problem.
p164
aVThe frame that the court was using
p165
aVto see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination
p166
aVwas partial, and it was distorting.
p167
aVFor me, the challenge that I faced was
p168
aVtrying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative,
p169
aVa prism that would allow us to see Emma's dilemma,
p170
aVa prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law,
p171
aVthat would allow judges to see her story.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo it occurred to me,
p174
aVmaybe a simple analogy to an intersection
p175
aVmight allow judges to better see Emma's dilemma.
p176
aVSo if we think about this intersection, the roads to the intersection would be
p177
aVthe way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender.
p178
aVAnd then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring policies
p179
aVand the other practices that ran through those roads.
p180
aVNow, because Emma was both black and female,
p181
aVshe was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped,
p182
aVexperiencing the simultaneous impact
p183
aVof the company's gender and race traffic.
p184
aVThe law \u2014 the law is like that ambulance that shows up
p185
aVand is ready to treat Emma only if it can be shown
p186
aVthat she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road
p187
aVbut not where those roads intersected.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo what do you call being impacted by multiple forces
p190
aVand then abandoned to fend for yourself?
p191
aVIntersectionality seemed to do it for me.
p192
aa(lp193
VI would go on to learn that African-American women,
p194
aVlike other women of color,
p195
aVlike other socially marginalized people all over the world,
p196
aVwere facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges
p197
aVas a consequence of intersectionality,
p198
aVintersections of race and gender,
p199
aVof heterosexism, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism,
p200
aVall of these social dynamics come together
p201
aVand create challenges that are sometimes quite unique.
p202
aVBut in the same way
p203
aVthat intersectionality
p204
aVraised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives,
p205
aVit also exposes the tragic circumstances
p206
aVunder which African-American women die.
p207
aa(lp208
VPolice violence against black women
p209
aVis very real.
p210
aVThe level of violence that black women face
p211
aVis such that it's not surprising
p212
aVthat some of them do not survive their encounters with police.
p213
aVBlack girls as young as seven,
p214
aVgreat grandmothers as old as 95
p215
aVhave been killed by the police.
p216
aVThey've been killed in their living rooms,
p217
aVin their bedrooms.
p218
aVThey've been killed in their cars.
p219
aVThey've been killed on the street.
p220
aVThey've been killed in front of their parents
p221
aVand they've been killed in front of their children.
p222
aVThey have been shot to death.
p223
aVThey have been stomped to death.
p224
aVThey have been suffocated to death.
p225
aVThey have been manhandled to death.
p226
aVThey have been tasered to death.
p227
aVThey've been killed when they've called for help.
p228
aVThey've been killed when they were alone,
p229
aVand they've been killed when they were with others.
p230
aVThey've been killed shopping while black,
p231
aVdriving while black,
p232
aVhaving a mental disability while black,
p233
aVhaving a domestic disturbance while black.
p234
aVThey've even been killed being homeless while black.
p235
aVThey've been killed talking on the cell phone,
p236
aVlaughing with friends,
p237
aVsitting in a car reported as stolen
p238
aVand making a U-turn in front of the White House
p239
aVwith an infant strapped in the backseat of the car.
p240
aVWhy don't we know these stories?
p241
aVWhy is it that their lost lives
p242
aVdon't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry
p243
aVas the lost lives of their fallen brothers?
p244
aVIt's time for a change.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo what can we do?
p247
aVIn 2014, the African-American Policy Forum began to demand
p248
aVthat we "say her name"
p249
aVat rallies, at protests,
p250
aVat conferences, at meetings,
p251
aVanywhere and everywhere
p252
aVthat state violence against black bodies is being discussed.
p253
aVBut saying her name is not enough.
p254
aVWe have to be willing to do more.
p255
aVWe have to be willing to bear witness,
p256
aVto bear witness to the often painful realities
p257
aVthat we would just rather not confront,
p258
aVthe everyday violence and humiliation that many black women have had to face,
p259
aVblack women across color,
p260
aVage, gender expression,
p261
aVsexuality and ability.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo we have the opportunity right now \u2014
p264
aVbearing in mind that some of the images that I'm about to share with you
p265
aVmay be triggering for some \u2014
p266
aVto collectively bear witness to some of this violence.
p267
aVWe're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.
p268
aVAnd as we sit with these women,
p269
aVsome who have experienced violence and some who have not survived them,
p270
aVwe have an opportunity
p271
aVto reverse what happened at the beginning of this talk,
p272
aVwhen we could not stand for these women
p273
aVbecause we did not know their names.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo at the end of this clip, there's going to be a roll call.
p276
aVSeveral black women's names will come up.
p277
aVI'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names
p278
aVas loud as you can,
p279
aVrandomly, disorderly.
p280
aVLet's create a cacophony of sound
p281
aVto represent our intention
p282
aVto hold these women up,
p283
aVto sit with them,
p284
aVto bear witness to them,
p285
aVto bring them into the light.

p306
aa(lp307

p308
aVI'll never know,
p309
aa(lp310

p316
aa(lp317

p318
aa(lp319
VKC: So I said at the beginning,
p320
aVif we can't see a problem,
p321
aVwe can't fix a problem.
p322
aVTogether, we've come together to bear witness
p323
aVto these women's lost lives.
p324
aVBut the time now is to move
p325
aVfrom mourning and grief
p326
aVto action and transformation.
p327
aVThis is something that we can do.
p328
aVIt's up to us.
