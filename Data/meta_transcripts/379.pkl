VYou hear that this is the era of environment \u2014 or biology, or information technology ...
p4
aVWell, it's the era of a lot of different things
p5
aVthat we're in right now. But one thing for sure:
p6
aVit's the era of change. There's more change going on
p7
aVthan ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.
p8
aVAnd you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it
p9
aVso that you really understand it.
p10
aVAnd I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.
p11
aVI've tried to show in this \u2014 though the color doesn't come out \u2014
p12
aVthat what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble
p13
aVthat you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,
p14
aVa generation future \u2014 your parents, your kids, things you can change
p15
aVover the next few decades \u2014 and this 50-year time bubble
p16
aVyou kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,
p17
aVif you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans
p18
aVon the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times
p19
aVsince I was born. When you have a new baby,
p20
aVby the time that kid gets out of high school
p21
aVmore people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.
p22
aVThis is unprecedented, and it's big.
p23
aVWhere it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.
p26
aVWhat I call the human portion \u2014 humans and their livestock and pets \u2014
p27
aVversus the natural portion \u2014 all the other wild animals and just \u2014
p28
aVthese are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,
p29
aVin the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?
p30
aVCertainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,
p31
aVthe human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.
p32
aVYou follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle \u2014
p33
aVthat's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets
p34
aVare now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth
p35
aVand all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation
p36
aVdoesn't even have to worry about this game \u2014 it is over.
p37
aVAnd the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:
p38
aVit went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.
p39
aVAnd this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,
p40
aVare in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods
p41
aVof old Greek myths, kind of playing with life \u2014
p42
aVand not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, the third curve is information technology.
p45
aVThis is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density
p46
aVof information, but it has been pretty good for showing
p47
aVa lot of other things about information technology \u2014
p48
aVcomputers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important
p49
aVis it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,
p50
aVand has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.
p51
aVThis is the size of the earth going through that same \u2014
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aV\u2014 frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.
p54
aVThere's no need to see the little detailed words on it.
p55
aVThat first one is humans-versus-nature;
p56
aVwe've won, there's no more gain. Human population.
p57
aVAnd so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,
p58
aVthat's not a good one \u2014 protecting natural creatures. Human population
p59
aVis going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.
p60
aVGood business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. \u2014
p61
aVthey all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,
p62
aVtransported, housed and so on. And the information technology,
p63
aVwhich connects to our brains, has no limit \u2014 now, that is a wonderful
p64
aVfield to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?
p65
aVIt's just going up through the roof.
p66
aVAnd then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible
p67
aVwith the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, that's the stage out of all this. I find,
p70
aVfor reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.
p71
aVAnd the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable
p72
aVwhen my kids reach my age \u2014 and I think that's \u2014 in other words,
p73
aVthe next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.
p74
aVI think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;
p75
aVeconomically, it's achievable; politically,
p76
aVit means sort of the habits, institutions of people \u2014 it's impossible.
p77
aVThe institutions of the past with all their inertia
p78
aVare just irrelevant for the future, except they're there
p79
aVand we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time
p80
aVtrying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual \u2014
p81
aVand whatever else we devote ourselves to.
p82
aVAnd in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,
p83
aVsomehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,
p84
aVwhich is putting information and dogma into them,
p85
aVget them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue
p86
aVabout serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,
p87
aVthink broadly or creative. They can be.
p88
aVOur school systems are very flawed and do not reward you
p89
aVfor the things that are important in life
p90
aVor for the survival of civilization; they reward you
p91
aVfor a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.
p92
aVWe can't go into that today because there isn't time \u2014
p93
aVit's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future
p94
aVthere is an essential feature \u2014 necessary, but not sufficient \u2014
p95
aVwhich is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things
p96
aVwith more efficiency using less energy, less material.
p97
aVYour great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,
p98
aVand yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential
p99
aVfor our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have
p100
aVwe can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.
p101
aa(lp102
VLet me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.
p103
aVHuman-powered airplane \u2014 Gossamer Condor sort of started me
p104
aVin this direction in 1976 and 77,
p105
aVwinning the Kremer prize in aviation history,
p106
aVfollowed by the Albatross. And we began
p107
aVmaking various odd planes and creatures.
p108
aVHere's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.
p109
aVTrying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow
p110
aVwith the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,
p111
aVand boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.
p112
aVThis was the full size of the original creature.
p113
aVWe did things on land, in the air, on water \u2014
p114
aVvehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics
p115
aVor electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,
p116
aVwhether its land, air or water.
p117
aVI'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane \u2014
p118
aV165 miles carrying a person from France to England
p119
aVas a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part
p120
aVof our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors \u2014
p121
aVthe Sunracer \u2014 that won the race in Australia.
p122
aVWe got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,
p123
aVwhat you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that
p124
aVnow is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,
p125
aVthey sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them
p126
aVon their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort
p127
aVinto turning it into a commercial product.
p128
aa(lp129
VWith that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,
p130
aVwhich shows a little airplane for surveillance
p131
aVand moving to a giant airplane.
p132
aVNarrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance \u2014
p133
aVin effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example
p134
aVof where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote
p135
aVfrom the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble
p136
aVand launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
p137
aVIt sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
p138
aVWith onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
p139
aVand it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
p140
aVThe modern sailplane is superbly efficient.
p141
aVSome can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.
p142
aVThey are powered only by the energy
p143
aVthey can extract from the atmosphere \u2014
p144
aVan atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.
p145
aVHumans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous
p146
aVin providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown
p147
aVover 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.
p148
aV(Music)
p149
aVThe Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol
p150
aVthat photovoltaic cells can produce real power
p151
aVand will be part of the world's energy future.
p152
aVIn 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,
p153
aVsolely on the power of sunbeams,
p154
aVand established a basis for the Pathfinder.
p155
aV(Music)
p156
aVThe message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology
p157
aVcan be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less \u2014
p158
aVgains that can help us attain a desirable balance
p159
aVbetween technology and nature. The stakes are high
p160
aVas we speed toward a challenging future.
p161
aVBuckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers
p162
aVon spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,
p163
aVcan and must do more with less \u2014 much less."
p164
aa(lp165
VPaul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,
p166
aVput in as quickly as you can, which \u2014 this will show
p167
aVthe Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,
p168
aVand will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it
p169
aVafter it had just flown to 71,530 feet \u2014
p170
aVhigher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.
p171
aVIt's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun \u2014
p172
aVby having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.
p173
aVIt's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.
p174
aVAnd we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,
p175
aVand with wonderful results like that flight.
p176
aVAnd we're working on a bigger plane \u2014 220-foot span \u2014
p177
aVand an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell
p178
aVthat can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,
p179
aVand stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.
p180
aV(Music)
p181
aVRay Morgan's voice will come in here.
p182
aVThere he's the project manager. Anything they do
p183
aVis certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...
p184
aVsome things he showed as a celebration at the very end.
p185
aVRay Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.
p186
aVFor those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.
p187
aVThe friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality
p188
aVshown by our Hawaiian and military hosts \u2014
p189
aV(Music)
p190
aVthis is starting \u2014
p191
aVmade the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
p192
aVPM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet
p193
aVwhile the plane is flying. And it's exploring
p194
aVwithout polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,
p195
aVthe blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth
p196
aVand permits life on earth to be the success that it is \u2014
p197
aVprobing that is very important. And also we consider it
p198
aVas a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,
p199
aVbecause it can stay right overhead for months at a time,
p200
aV2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.
p201
aVWe couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut now let's look at the other end.
p204
aVIn the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane
p205
aVsurveillance drone that Keenan has developed
p206
aVand just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos
p207
aVthat have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,
p208
aVhis weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here
p209
aVis a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces \u2014
p210
aVthat includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,
p211
aVthe telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,
p212
aVwith the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.
p213
aVSo Matt Keenan, just any time you're \u2014
p214
aVall right
p215
aV\u2014 ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure
p216
aVthat it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.
p217
aVYou can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,
p218
aVlooking out of its camera.
p219
aVMatt Keenan: It's switched on.
p220
aVPM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.
p221
aVMK: Can you bring up the house lights?
p222
aVPM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better
p223
aVand be able to fly the plane better.
p224
aVMK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.
p225
aVHere we go.
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aVPM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it \u2014
p228
aVthere it goes.
p229
aVOh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe
p230
aVto have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.
p231
aVWe get to do the classic.
p232
aVAll right.
p233
aVIf this hits you, it will not hurt you.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVOK.
p236
aV(Applause)
p237
aVThank you very much. Thank you.
p238
aV(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VBut now, as they say in infomercials,
p241
aVwe have something much better for you, which we're working on:
p242
aVplanes that are only six inches \u2014 15 centimeters \u2014 in size.
p243
aVAnd Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,
p244
aVshowing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size
p245
aVwill have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly
p246
aVnine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour
p247
aVwith just a little battery in it.
p248
aVBut there's a lot of technology going.
p249
aVThere are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.
p250
aVThis one doesn't have the video in it,
p251
aVbut you get a little feel from what it can do.
p252
aVOK, here we go.
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aVMK: Sorry.
p255
aVOK.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aVPM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think \u2014
p258
aVI lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.
p259
aVIt hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVBut you're beginning to see what can be done.
p262
aVWe're working on projects now \u2014 even wing-flapping things
p263
aVthe size of hawk moths \u2014 DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhere all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.
p266
aVBut like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things
p267
aVthat are way beyond existing technology,
p268
aVyou can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.
p269
aVYou can do amazing things when you realize
p270
aVwhat nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,
p271
aVyou realize we have a lot to learn from nature \u2014 not with 747s \u2014
p272
aVbut when you get down to the nature's realm,
p273
aVnature has 200 million years of experience.
p274
aVIt never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,
p275
aVyou don't leave any progeny.
p276
aVWe should have nothing but success stories from nature,
p277
aVfor you or for birds, and we're learning a lot
p278
aVfrom its fascinating subjects.
p279
aa(lp280
VIn concluding, I want to get back to the big picture
p281
aVand I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.
p282
aVThe first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences
p283
aVand had it say what I wanted.
p284
aVOver billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted
p285
aVa thin covering of life \u2014 complex, improbable, wonderful
p286
aVand fragile. Suddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species,
p287
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014
p288
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p289
aVto a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.
p290
aVAnd that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;
p291
aVwe're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?
p292
aa(lp293
VWell, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.
p294
aVEvery 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one \u2014
p295
aVtries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.
p296
aVSort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates
p297
aVand trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans
p298
aVwith caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.
p299
aVAnd then we get to the civilization above the little TV set
p300
aVwith a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,
p301
aVand some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead \u2014 I have no idea.
p302
aVAnd so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,
p303
aVbut you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.
p304
aVThis is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.
p305
aVAnd that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.
p306
aVThings are going on this decade, next decade;
p307
aVit's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.
p308
aVAnd if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be \u2014
p309
aVdesirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age \u2014
p310
aVI think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,
p311
aVnot a forecast. That was before \u2014
p312
aVI painted this before we started in on making robotic versions
p313
aVof hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder
p314
aVseriously \u2014 was this more of a forecast than I wanted?
p315
aVI personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth
p316
aVis not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.
p317
aVAnd so where it all goes, I don't know.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here
p320
aVis an utterly impractical flight vehicle,
p321
aVwhich is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that \u2014
p322
aVrubber-band powered \u2014 that we'll show you.
p323
aVMK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.
p324
aVPM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns
p325
aVand it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.
p326
aVThe tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.
p327
aVAnd if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.
p328
aVBut if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.
p329
aVSo, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.
p330
aVAnd when it comes down \u2014 and we'll see how it goes.
p331
aVWe consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.
p332
aV(Applause)
p333
aVAnd you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been \u2014
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aVUnfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.
p337
aVWe can probably get it down,
p338
aVbut it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there \u2014
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aV\u2014 than it ever had. And I wanted to make \u2014
p341
aV(Applause)
p342
aVjust \u2014
p343
aV(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VBut I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;
p346
aVthere's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters
p347
aVlike that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 \u2014 a long, long time ago \u2014
p348
aVthere wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,
p349
aVthere wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,
p350
aVthere wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate
p351
aVon zero-emission vehicles in California.
p352
aVA lot of these things \u2014 or similar \u2014 would have happened some time,
p353
aVprobably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time
p354
aVI was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,
p355
aVlike they're trying to get in education systems.
p356
aVSo I think that, as a symbol, it's important.
p357
aVAnd I believe that also is important. You can think of it
p358
aVas a sort of a symbol for learning and TED
p359
aVthat somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,
p360
aVand puts it all together in things that are \u2014
p361
aVthat make this conference, I think, more important than any
p362
aVthat's taken place in this country in this decade.
p363
aVThank you. (Applause)
