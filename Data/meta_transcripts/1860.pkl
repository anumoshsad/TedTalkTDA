VI am a neuroscientist
p4
aVwith a mixed background in physics and medicine.
p5
aVMy lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
p6
aVfocuses on spinal cord injury,
p7
aVwhich affects more than 50,000 people
p8
aVaround the world every year,
p9
aVwith dramatic consequences for affected individuals,
p10
aVwhose life literally shatters
p11
aVin a matter of a handful of seconds.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd for me, the Man of Steel,
p14
aVChristopher Reeve,
p15
aVhas best raised the awareness
p16
aVon the distress of spinal cord injured people.
p17
aVAnd this is how I started my own personal journey
p18
aVin this field of research,
p19
aVworking with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.
p20
aa(lp21
VI still remember this decisive moment.
p22
aVIt was just at the end of a regular day of work
p23
aVwith the foundation.
p24
aVChris addressed us, the scientists and experts,
p25
aV"You have to be more pragmatic.
p26
aVWhen leaving your laboratory tomorrow,
p27
aVI want you to stop by the rehabilitation center
p28
aVto watch injured people
p29
aVfighting to take a step,
p30
aVstruggling to maintain their trunk.
p31
aVAnd when you go home,
p32
aVthink of what you are going to change in your research
p33
aVon the following day to make their lives better."
p34
aa(lp35
VThese words, they stuck with me.
p36
aVThis was more than 10 years ago,
p37
aVbut ever since, my laboratory has followed
p38
aVthe pragmatic approach to recovery
p39
aVafter spinal cord injury.
p40
aVAnd my first step in this direction
p41
aVwas to develop a new model of spinal cord injury
p42
aVthat would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury
p43
aVwhile offering well-controlled experimental conditions.
p44
aVAnd for this purpose, we placed two hemisections
p45
aVon opposite sides of the body.
p46
aVThey completely interrupt the communication
p47
aVbetween the brain and the spinal cord,
p48
aVthus leading to complete and permanent paralysis
p49
aVof the leg.
p50
aVBut, as observed, after most injuries in humans,
p51
aVthere is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue
p52
aVthrough which recovery can occur.
p53
aVBut how to make it happen?
p54
aa(lp55
VWell, the classical approach
p56
aVconsists of applying intervention
p57
aVthat would promote the growth of the severed fiber
p58
aVto the original target.
p59
aVAnd while this certainly remained the key for a cure,
p60
aVthis seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.
p61
aVTo reach clinical fruition rapidly,
p62
aVit was obvious:
p63
aVI had to think about the problem differently.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt turned out that more than 100 years of research
p66
aVon spinal cord physiology,
p67
aVstarting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,
p68
aVhad shown that
p69
aVthe spinal cord, below most injuries,
p70
aVcontained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks
p71
aVto coordinate locomotion,
p72
aVbut because input from the brain is interrupted,
p73
aVthey are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.
p74
aVMy idea: We awaken this network.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,
p77
aVafter completing my Ph.D. in France,
p78
aVwhere independent thinking
p79
aVis not necessarily promoted.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVI was afraid to talk to my new boss,
p82
aVbut decided to muster up my courage.
p83
aVI knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,
p84
aVReggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.
p85
aa(lp86
VHe listened to me carefully,
p87
aVand responded with a grin.
p88
aV"Why don't you try?"
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd I promise to you,
p91
aVthis was such an important moment in my career,
p92
aVwhen I realized that the great leader
p93
aVbelieved in young people and new ideas.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd this was the idea:
p96
aVI'm going to use a simplistic metaphor
p97
aVto explain to you this complicated concept.
p98
aVImagine that the locomotor system is a car.
p99
aVThe engine is the spinal cord.
p100
aVThe transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.
p101
aVHow could we re-engage the engine?
p102
aVFirst, we have to provide the fuel;
p103
aVsecond, press the accelerator pedal;
p104
aVthird, steer the car.
p105
aVIt turned out that there are known neural pathways
p106
aVcoming from the brain that play this very function
p107
aVduring locomotion.
p108
aVMy idea: Replace this missing input
p109
aVto provide the spinal cord
p110
aVwith the kind of intervention
p111
aVthat the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.
p112
aa(lp113
VFor this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,
p114
aVfirst to replace the missing fuel
p115
aVwith pharmacological agents
p116
aVthat prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,
p117
aVand second, to mimic the accelerator pedal
p118
aVwith electrical stimulation.
p119
aVSo here imagine an electrode
p120
aVimplanted on the back of the spinal cord
p121
aVto deliver painless stimulation.
p122
aVIt took many years, but eventually we developed
p123
aVan electrochemical neuroprosthesis
p124
aVthat transformed the neural network
p125
aVin the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.
p126
aVImmediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.
p127
aVAs soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,
p128
aVthe animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,
p129
aVbut without the brain.
p130
aVHere what I call "the spinal brain"
p131
aVcognitively processes sensory information
p132
aVarising from the moving leg
p133
aVand makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle
p134
aVin order to stand, to walk, to run,
p135
aVand even here, while sprinting,
p136
aVinstantly stand
p137
aVif the treadmill stops moving.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis was amazing.
p140
aVI was completely fascinated by this locomotion
p141
aVwithout the brain,
p142
aVbut at the same time so frustrated.
p143
aVThis locomotion was completely involuntary.
p144
aVThe animal had virtually no control over the legs.
p145
aVClearly, the steering system was missing.
p146
aVAnd it then became obvious from me
p147
aVthat we had to move away
p148
aVfrom the classical rehabilitation paradigm,
p149
aVstepping on a treadmill,
p150
aVand develop conditions that would encourage
p151
aVthe brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.
p152
aa(lp153
VWith this in mind, we developed a completely new
p154
aVrobotic system to support the rat
p155
aVin any direction of space.
p156
aVImagine, this is really cool.
p157
aVSo imagine the little 200-gram rat
p158
aVattached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,
p159
aVbut the rat does not feel the robot.
p160
aVThe robot is transparent,
p161
aVjust like you would hold a young child
p162
aVduring the first insecure steps.
p163
aa(lp164
VLet me summarize: The rat received
p165
aVa paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.
p166
aVThe electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled
p167
aVa highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.
p168
aVThe robot provided the safe environment
p169
aVto allow the rat to attempt anything
p170
aVto engage the paralyzed legs.
p171
aVAnd for motivation, we used what I think
p172
aVis the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:
p173
aVfine Swiss chocolate.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VActually, the first results were very, very,
p178
aVvery disappointing.
p179
aVHere is my best physical therapist
p180
aVcompletely failing to encourage the rat
p181
aVto take a single step,
p182
aVwhereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,
p183
aVwalked beautifully on the treadmill.
p184
aVWe were so frustrated.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut you know, one of the most essential qualities
p187
aVof a scientist is perseverance.
p188
aVWe insisted. We refined our paradigm,
p189
aVand after several months of training,
p190
aVthe otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,
p191
aVand whenever she decided,
p192
aVinitiated full weight-bearing locomotion
p193
aVto sprint towards the rewards.
p194
aVThis is the first recovery ever observed
p195
aVof voluntary leg movement
p196
aVafter an experimental lesion of the spinal cord
p197
aVleading to complete and permanent paralysis.
p198
aa(lp199
VIn fact \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VThank you.
p204
aa(lp205
VIn fact, not only could the rat initiate
p206
aVand sustain locomotion on the ground,
p207
aVthey could even adjust leg movement,
p208
aVfor example, to resist gravity
p209
aVin order to climb a staircase.
p210
aVI can promise you this was
p211
aVsuch an emotional moment in my laboratory.
p212
aVIt took us 10 years of hard work
p213
aVto reach this goal.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut the remaining question was, how?
p216
aVI mean, how is it possible?
p217
aVAnd here, what we found
p218
aVwas completely unexpected.
p219
aVThis novel training paradigm
p220
aVencouraged the brain to create new connections,
p221
aVsome relay circuits
p222
aVthat relay information from the brain
p223
aVpast the injury and restore cortical control
p224
aVover the locomotor networks below the injury.
p225
aVAnd here, you can see one such example,
p226
aVwhere we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.
p227
aVThis blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,
p228
aVand what this constellation
p229
aVof synaptic contacts means
p230
aVis that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center
p231
aVwith only one relay neuron.
p232
aVBut the remodeling was not restricted
p233
aVto the lesion area.
p234
aVIt occurred throughout the central nervous system,
p235
aVincluding in the brain stem,
p236
aVwhere we observed up to 300-percent increase
p237
aVin the density of fibers coming from the brain.
p238
aVWe did not aim to repair the spinal cord,
p239
aVyet we were able to promote
p240
aVone of the more extensive remodeling
p241
aVof axonal projections ever observed
p242
aVin the central nervous system of adult mammal
p243
aVafter an injury.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd there is a very important message
p246
aVhidden behind this discovery.
p247
aVThey are the result of a young team
p248
aVof very talented people:
p249
aVphysical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,
p250
aVengineers of all kinds,
p251
aVwho have achieved together
p252
aVwhat would have been impossible by single individuals.
p253
aVThis is truly a trans-disciplinary team.
p254
aVThey are working so close to each other
p255
aVthat there is horizontal transfer of DNA.
p256
aVWe are creating the next generation
p257
aVof M.D.'s and engineers
p258
aVcapable of translating discoveries all the way
p259
aVfrom bench to bedside.
p260
aVAnd me?
p261
aVI am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,
p264
aVwill this help injured people?
p265
aVMe too, every day.
p266
aVThe truth is that we don't know enough yet.
p267
aVThis is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,
p268
aVbut I begin to believe that this may lead
p269
aVto an intervention to improve recovery
p270
aVand people's quality of life.
p271
aa(lp272
VI would like you all
p273
aVto take a moment and dream with me.
p274
aVImagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.
p275
aVAfter a few weeks of recovery,
p276
aVwe will implant a programmable pump
p277
aVto deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail
p278
aVdirectly to the spinal cord.
p279
aVAt the same time, we will implant an electrode array,
p280
aVa sort of second skin
p281
aVcovering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,
p282
aVand this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator
p283
aVthat delivers stimulations that are tailored
p284
aVto the person's needs.
p285
aVThis defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis
p286
aVthat will enable locomotion
p287
aVduring training with a newly designed supporting system.
p288
aVAnd my hope is that after several months of training,
p289
aVthere may be enough remodeling of residual connection
p290
aVto allow locomotion without the robot,
p291
aVmaybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.
p292
aVMy hope here is to be able to create
p293
aVthe personalized condition
p294
aVto boost the plasticity of the brain
p295
aVand the spinal cord.
p296
aVAnd this is a radically new concept
p297
aVthat may apply to other neurological disorders,
p298
aVwhat I termed "personalized neuroprosthetics,"
p299
aVwhere by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,
p300
aVI implanted throughout the nervous system,
p301
aVin the brain, in the spinal cord,
p302
aVeven in peripheral nerves,
p303
aVbased on patient-specific impairments.
p304
aVBut not to replace the lost function, no \u2014
p305
aVto help the brain help itself.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd I hope this enticed your imagination,
p308
aVbecause I can promise to you
p309
aVthis is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,
p310
aVbut when.
p311
aVAnd remember, we are only as great
p312
aVas our imagination, as big as our dream.
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.
