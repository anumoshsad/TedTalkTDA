VI'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.
p4
aVNot yours, of course \u2014 other people's.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VSo after being at MIT for a few years,
p9
aVI realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting.
p10
aVYou know, I don't know how many of those you read,
p11
aVbut it's not fun to read and often not fun to write \u2014
p12
aVeven worse to write.
p13
aVSo I decided to try and write something more fun.
p14
aVAnd I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.
p15
aVAnd the title for my cookbook was going to be,
p16
aV"Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink."
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen.
p21
aVI was quite excited about this.
p22
aVI was going to talk a little bit about research,
p23
aVa little bit about the kitchen.
p24
aVWe do so much in the kitchen, I thought this would be interesting.
p25
aVI wrote a couple of chapters, and took it to MIT Press and they said,
p26
aa(lp27
V"Cute, but not for us. Go and find somebody else."
p28
aa(lp29
VI tried other people, and everybody said the same thing,
p30
aa(lp31
V"Cute. Not for us."
p32
aa(lp33
VUntil somebody said,
p34
aV"Look, if you're serious about this,
p35
aVyou have to write about your research first; you have to publish something,
p36
aVthen you'll get the opportunity to write something else.
p37
aVIf you really want to do it, you have to do it."
p38
aa(lp39
VI said, "I don't want to write about my research.
p40
aVI do it all day long,
p41
aVI want to write something a bit more free, less constrained."
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd this person was very forceful and said,
p44
aV"Look, that's the only way you'll ever do it."
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I said, "Okay, if I have to do it \u2014"
p47
aVI had a sabbatical.
p48
aVI said, "I'll write about my research, if there's no other way.
p49
aVAnd then I'll get to do my cookbook."
p50
aVSo, I wrote a book on my research.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.
p53
aVFirst of all, I enjoyed writing.
p54
aVBut the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people.
p55
aVIt's a fantastic time to write,
p56
aVbecause there's so much feedback you can get from people.
p57
aVPeople write to me about their personal experience,
p58
aVand about their examples, and where they disagree,
p59
aVand their nuances.
p60
aVAnd even being here \u2014 I mean, the last few days,
p61
aVI've known heights of obsessive behavior
p62
aVI never thought about.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VWhich I think is just fascinating.
p67
aa(lp68
VI will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior,
p69
aVand I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion
p70
aVas a metaphor for rationality.
p71
aVSo think about these two tables.
p72
aVAnd you must have seen this illusion.
p73
aVIf I asked you what's longer, the vertical line on the table on the left,
p74
aVor the horizontal line on the table on the right,
p75
aVwhich one seems longer?
p76
aVCan anybody see anything but the left one being longer?
p77
aVNo, right? It's impossible.
p78
aVBut the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.
p79
aVSo I can put some lines on; it doesn't help.
p80
aVI can animate the lines.
p81
aVAnd to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines,
p82
aVwhich I didn't, I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you.
p83
aVNow, the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away,
p84
aVit's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VYou can't look at this and say, "Now I see reality as it is."
p89
aVRight? It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer.
p90
aVOur intuition is really fooling us
p91
aVin a repeatable, predictable, consistent way.
p92
aVand there is almost nothing we can do about it,
p93
aVaside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere's another one. It's one of my favorite illusions.
p96
aVWhat color is the top arrow pointing to?
p97
aa(lp98
VAudience: Brown. Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe bottom one? Yellow.
p101
aVTurns out they're identical.
p102
aVCan anybody see them as identical?
p103
aVVery, very hard.
p104
aVI can cover the rest of the cube up.
p105
aVIf I cover the rest of the cube, you can see that they are identical.
p106
aVIf you don't believe me, you can get the slide later
p107
aVand do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.
p108
aVBut again, it's the same story, that if we take the background away,
p109
aVthe illusion comes back.
p110
aVThere is no way for us not to see this illusion.
p111
aVI guess maybe if you're colorblind, I don't think you can see that.
p112
aVI want you to think about illusion as a metaphor.
p113
aa(lp114
VVision is one of the best things we do.
p115
aVWe have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision \u2014
p116
aVbigger than dedicated to anything else.
p117
aVWe use our vision more hours of the day than anything else.
p118
aVWe're evolutionarily designed to use vision.
p119
aVAnd if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision,
p120
aVwhich we're so good at,
p121
aVwhat are the chances we won't make even more mistakes
p122
aVin something we're not as good at, for example, financial decision-making.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VSomething we don't have an evolutionary reason to do,
p127
aVwe don't have a specialized part of the brain for,
p128
aVand we don't do that many hours of the day.
p129
aVThe argument is in those cases,
p130
aVit might be that we actually make many more mistakes.
p131
aVAnd worse \u2014 not having an easy way to see them,
p132
aVbecause in visual illusions, we can easily demonstrate the mistakes;
p133
aVin cognitive illusion it's much, much harder
p134
aVto demonstrate the mistakes to people.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo I want to show you some cognitive illusions,
p137
aVor decision-making illusions, in the same way.
p138
aVAnd this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.
p139
aVIt's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.
p140
aVIt basically shows the percentage of people who indicated
p141
aVthey would be interested in donating their organs.
p142
aVThese are different countries in Europe.
p143
aVYou basically see two types of countries:
p144
aVcountries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot;
p145
aVand countries on the left that seem to giving very little,
p146
aVor much less.
p147
aVThe question is, why?
p148
aVWhy do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?
p149
aa(lp150
VWhen you ask people this question,
p151
aVthey usually think that it has to be about culture.
p152
aVHow much do you care about people?
p153
aVGiving organs to somebody else
p154
aVis probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
p155
aVOr maybe it's about religion.
p156
aVBut if you look at this plot,
p157
aVyou can see that countries that we think about as very similar,
p158
aVactually exhibit very different behavior.
p159
aVFor example, Sweden is all the way on the right,
p160
aVand Denmark, which we think is culturally very similar,
p161
aVis all the way on the left.
p162
aVGermany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.
p163
aVThe Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.
p164
aVAnd finally, depending on your particular version
p165
aVof European similarity,
p166
aVyou can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not,
p167
aVbut it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.
p168
aa(lp169
VBy the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story.
p170
aVYou see, the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group.
p171
aVIt turns out that they got to 28 percent
p172
aVafter mailing every household in the country a letter,
p173
aVbegging people to join this organ donation program.
p174
aVYou know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far."
p175
aVIt's 28 percent in organ donation.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VBut whatever the countries on the right are doing,
p180
aVthey're doing a much better job than begging.
p181
aVSo what are they doing?
p182
aVTurns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.
p183
aVAnd here is the story.
p184
aVThe countries on the left have a form at the DMV
p185
aVthat looks something like this.
p186
aV"Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program."
p187
aVAnd what happens?
p188
aVPeople don't check, and they don't join.
p189
aVThe countries on the right, the ones that give a lot,
p190
aVhave a slightly different form.
p191
aVIt says, "Check the box below if you don't want to participate ..."
p192
aVInterestingly enough, when people get this,
p193
aVthey again don't check, but now they join.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, think about what this means.
p198
aVYou know, we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.
p199
aVWe wake up in the morning and we open the closet;
p200
aVwe feel that we decide what to wear.
p201
aVwe open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.
p202
aVWhat this is actually saying,
p203
aVis that many of these decisions are not residing within us.
p204
aVThey are residing in the person who is designing that form.
p205
aVWhen you walk into the DMV,
p206
aVthe person who designed the form will have a huge influence
p207
aVon what you'll end up doing.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, it's also very hard to intuit these results.
p210
aVThink about it for yourself.
p211
aVHow many of you believe
p212
aVthat if you went to renew your license tomorrow,
p213
aVand you went to the DMV,
p214
aVand you encountered one of these forms,
p215
aVthat it would actually change your own behavior?
p216
aVVery hard to think that it would influence us.
p217
aVWe can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans, of course it would influence them."
p218
aVBut when it comes to us,
p219
aVwe have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat,
p220
aVsuch a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision,
p221
aVthat it's very hard to even accept the idea
p222
aVthat we actually have an illusion of making a decision,
p223
aVrather than an actual decision.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, you might say,
p226
aV"These are decisions we don't care about."
p227
aVIn fact, by definition, these are decisions
p228
aVabout something that will happen to us after we die.
p229
aVHow could we care about something less
p230
aVthan about something that happens after we die?
p231
aVSo a standard economist, somebody who believes in rationality,
p232
aVwould say, "You know what?
p233
aVThe cost of lifting the pencil and marking a "V" is higher
p234
aVthan the possible benefit of the decision,
p235
aVso that's why we get this effect."
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VBut, in fact, it's not because it's easy.
p240
aVIt's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care.
p241
aVIt's the opposite. It's because we care.
p242
aVIt's difficult and it's complex.
p243
aVAnd it's so complex that we don't know what to do.
p244
aVAnd because we have no idea what to do,
p245
aVwe just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.
p246
aa(lp247
VI'll give you one more example.
p248
aVThis is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir.
p249
aVAnd they said, "Would this effect also happens to experts?
p250
aVPeople who are well-paid, experts in their decisions,
p251
aVand who make a lot of them?"
p252
aVAnd they took a group of physicians.
p253
aVThey presented to them a case study of a patient.
p254
aVThey said, "Here is a patient. He is a 67-year-old farmer.
p255
aVHe's been suffering from right hip pain for a while."
p256
aVAnd then, they said to the physicians,
p257
aV"You decided a few weeks ago
p258
aVthat nothing is working for this patient.
p259
aVAll these medications, nothing seems to be working.
p260
aVSo you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy.
p261
aVHip replacement. Okay?"
p262
aVSo the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.
p263
aa(lp264
VThen they said to half of the physicians,
p265
aV"Yesterday, you reviewed the patient's case,
p266
aVand you realized that you forgot to try one medication.
p267
aVYou did not try ibuprofen.
p268
aVWhat do you do? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?
p269
aVOr do you let him go and have hip replacement?"
p270
aVWell, the good news is that most physicians in this case
p271
aVdecided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen.
p272
aVVery good for the physicians.
p273
aa(lp274
VTo the other group of physicians, they said,
p275
aV"Yesterday when you reviewed the case, you discovered there were two medications
p276
aVyou didn't try out yet \u2014 ibuprofen and piroxicam."
p277
aVYou have two medications you didn't try out yet.
p278
aVWhat do you do? You let him go, or you pull him back?
p279
aVAnd if you pull him back, do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"
p280
aVNow, think of it:
p281
aVThis decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement,
p282
aVbut pulling him back, all of the sudden it becomes more complex.
p283
aVThere is one more decision.
p284
aVWhat happens now?
p285
aVThe majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go
p286
aVfor a hip replacement.
p287
aVI hope this worries you, by the way \u2014
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
Vwhen you go to see your physician.
p292
aVThe thing is that no physician would ever say,
p293
aV"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement. Let's go for hip replacement."
p294
aVBut the moment you set this as the default,
p295
aVit has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.
p296
aa(lp297
VI'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.
p298
aVImagine I give you a choice:
p299
aVDo you want to go for a weekend to Rome, all expenses paid \u2014
p300
aVhotel, transportation, food, a continental breakfast, everything \u2014
p301
aVor a weekend in Paris?
p302
aVNow, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome \u2014 these are different things.
p303
aVThey have different food, different culture, different art.
p304
aVImagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted.
p305
aVImagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,
p306
aVa weekend in Paris,
p307
aVor having your car stolen?"
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VIt's a funny idea, because why would having your car stolen,
p312
aVin this set, influence anything?
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VBut what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this?
p317
aVWhat if it was a trip to Rome, all expenses paid,
p318
aVtransportation, breakfast,
p319
aVbut it doesn't include coffee in the morning?
p320
aVIf you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VNow in some ways,
p325
aVgiven that you can have Rome with coffee,
p326
aVwhy would you possibly want Rome without coffee?
p327
aVIt's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option.
p328
aVBut guess what happened?
p329
aVThe moment you add Rome without coffee,
p330
aVRome with coffee becomes more popular, and people choose it.
p331
aVThe fact that you have Rome without coffee
p332
aVmakes Rome with coffee look superior,
p333
aVand not just to Rome without coffee \u2014 even superior to Paris.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VHere are two examples of this principle.
p338
aVThis was an ad in The Economist a few years ago
p339
aVthat gave us three choices:
p340
aVan online subscription for 59 dollars,
p341
aVa print subscription for 125 dollars,
p342
aVor you could get both for 125.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VNow I looked at this, and I called up The Economist,
p347
aVand I tried to figure out what they were thinking.
p348
aVAnd they passed me from one person to another to another,
p349
aVuntil eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website,
p350
aVand I called them up, and they went to check what was going on.
p351
aVThe next thing I know, the ad is gone, no explanation.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo I decided to do the experiment
p354
aVthat I would have loved The Economist to do with me.
p355
aVI took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.
p356
aVI said, "What would you choose?"
p357
aVThese are the market shares \u2014 most people wanted the combo deal.
p358
aVThankfully, nobody wanted the dominant option.
p359
aVThat means our students can read.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VBut now, if you have an option that nobody wants,
p364
aVyou can take it off, right?
p365
aVSo I printed another version of this,
p366
aVwhere I eliminated the middle option.
p367
aVI gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happened:
p368
aVNow the most popular option became the least popular,
p369
aVand the least popular became the most popular.
p370
aa(lp371
VWhat was happening was the option that was useless,
p372
aVin the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
p373
aVBut it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out
p374
aVwhat they wanted.
p375
aVIn fact, relative to the option in the middle,
p376
aVwhich was get only the print for 125,
p377
aVthe print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal.
p378
aVAnd as a consequence, people chose it.
p379
aVThe general idea here, by the way,
p380
aVis that we actually don't know our preferences that well.
p381
aVAnd because we don't know our preferences that well,
p382
aVwe're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces:
p383
aVthe defaults, the particular options that are presented to us, and so on.
p384
aa(lp385
VOne more example of this.
p386
aVPeople believe that when we deal with physical attraction,
p387
aVwe see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not,
p388
aVif we're attracted or not.
p389
aVThis is why we have these four-minute dates.
p390
aVSo I decided to do this experiment with people.
p391
aVI'll show you images here, no real people, but the experiment was with people.
p392
aVI showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
p393
aVand I said, "Who do you want to date?
p394
aVTom or Jerry?"
p395
aVBut for half the people, I added an ugly version of Jerry.
p396
aVI took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VFor the other people, I added an ugly version of Tom.
p401
aVAnd the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
p402
aVhelp their respective, more attractive brothers?
p403
aVThe answer was absolutely yes.
p404
aVWhen ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.
p405
aVWhen ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VThis of course has two very clear implications
p410
aVfor life in general.
p411
aVIf you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you?
p412
aa(lp413
V(Laughter)
p414
aa(lp415
VYou want a slightly uglier version of yourself.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VSimilar, but slightly uglier.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Laughter)
p422
aa(lp423
VThe second point, or course, is that if somebody invites you to bar hop,
p424
aVyou know what they think about you.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VNow you get it.
p429
aa(lp430
VWhat is the general point?
p431
aVThe general point is that,
p432
aVwhen we think about economics, we have this beautiful view of human nature.
p433
aV"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason!"
p434
aVWe have this view of ourselves, of others.
p435
aVThe behavioral economics perspective is slightly less "generous" to people;
p436
aVin fact, in medical terms,
p437
aVthat's our view.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Laughter)
p440
aa(lp441
VBut there is a silver lining.
p442
aVThe silver lining is, I think,
p443
aVkind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.
p444
aVAre we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?
p445
aa(lp446
VWhen it comes to building the physical world,
p447
aVwe kind of understand our limitations.
p448
aVWe build steps.
p449
aVAnd we build these things that not everybody can use, obviously.
p450
aa(lp451
V(Laughter)
p452
aa(lp453
VWe understand our limitations,
p454
aVand we build around them.
p455
aVBut for some reason, when it comes to the mental world,
p456
aVwhen we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets,
p457
aVwe somehow forget the idea that we are limited.
