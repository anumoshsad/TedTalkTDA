VHi everyone.
p4
aVI'm an artist and a dad \u2014 second time around.
p5
aVThank you.
p6
aVAnd I want to share with you my latest art project.
p7
aVIt's a children's book for the iPad.
p8
aVIt's a little quirky and silly.
p9
aVIt's called "Pop-It,"
p10
aVAnd it's about the things little kids do with their parents.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Music)
p13
aa(lp14
VSo this is about potty training \u2014
p15
aVas most of you, I hope, know.
p16
aVYou can tickle the rug.
p17
aVYou can make the baby poop.
p18
aVYou can do all those fun things.
p19
aVYou can burst bubbles.
p20
aVYou can draw, as everyone should.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut you know, I have a problem with children's books:
p23
aVI think they're full of propaganda.
p24
aVAt least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.
p25
aVIt's not the way I was brought up.
p26
aVSo I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."
p27
aVIf you notice carefully,
p28
aVit's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.
p29
aVYou don't like it?
p30
aVShake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVShake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
p33
aVYou know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.
p34
aa(lp35
VI have to tell you about my childhood.
p36
aVI went to this very proper Christian school
p37
aVtaught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.
p38
aVBasically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,
p39
aVand I am.
p40
aVAnd I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,
p41
aVwhich was probably the only Hindu house
p42
aVin a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.
p43
aVBasically, I celebrated every religious function.
p44
aVIn fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,
p45
aVall of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
p46
aVI remember we cried profusely
p47
aVwhen the little goats we played with in the summer
p48
aVbecame biriani.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVWe all had to fast during Ramadan.
p51
aVIt was a very beautiful time.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut I must say,
p54
aVI'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.
p55
aVBabri Masjid \u2014
p56
aVone of the most beautiful mosques in India,
p57
aVbuilt by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century \u2014
p58
aVwas demolished by Hindu activists.
p59
aVThis caused major riots in my city.
p60
aVAnd for the first time,
p61
aVI was affected
p62
aVby this communal unrest.
p63
aVMy little five-year-old kid neighbor
p64
aVcomes running in,
p65
aVand he says, "Rags, Rags.
p66
aVYou know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."
p67
aVI'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVHe's like, "Huh!"
p70
aa(lp71
VYou know, my work is inspired
p72
aVby events such as this.
p73
aVEven in my gallery shows,
p74
aVI try and revisit historic events
p75
aVlike Babri Masjid,
p76
aVdistill only its emotional residue
p77
aVand image my own life.
p78
aVImagine history being taught differently.
p79
aa(lp80
VRemember that children's book
p81
aVwhere you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?
p82
aVI have another idea.
p83
aVIt's a children's book about Indian independence \u2014
p84
aVvery patriotic.
p85
aVBut when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
p86
aVShake it again, and you get the British perspective.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause)
p89
aa(lp90
VYou have to separate fact from bias, right.
p91
aVEven my books on children
p92
aVhave cute, fuzzy animals.
p93
aVBut they're playing geopolitics.
p94
aVThey're playing out Israel-Palestine,
p95
aVIndia-Pakistan.
p96
aVYou know, I'm making a very important argument.
p97
aVAnd my argument [is]
p98
aVthat the only way for us to teach creativity
p99
aVis by teaching children perspectives
p100
aVat the earliest stage.
p101
aVAfter all, children's books are manuals on parenting,
p102
aVso you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.
p103
aVAnd conversely,
p104
aVonly when you teach perspectives
p105
aVwill a child be able to imagine
p106
aVand put themselves in the shoes
p107
aVof someone who is different from them.
p108
aa(lp109
VI'm making an argument that art and creativity
p110
aVare very essential tools in empathy.
p111
aVYou know, I can't promise my child
p112
aVa life without bias \u2014
p113
aVwe're all biased \u2014
p114
aVbut I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
p115
aa(lp116
VThank you very much.
