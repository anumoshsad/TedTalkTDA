VI get asked a lot what the difference between my work is
p4
aVand typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.
p5
aVAnd the answer I like to offer is
p6
aVwhat they typically do is they think about the future of wars
p7
aVin the context of war.
p8
aVAnd what I've spent 15 years doing in this business \u2014
p9
aVand it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out \u2014
p10
aVis I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else.
p11
aVSo I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace.
p12
aVThe material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book
p13
aVwith a lot of ideas.
p14
aVIt's the one that takes me around the world right now
p15
aVinteracting with foreign militaries quite a bit.
p16
aVThe material was generated in two years of work I did
p17
aVfor the Secretary of Defense,
p18
aVthinking about a new national grand strategy
p19
aVfor the United States.
p20
aVI'm going to present a problem
p21
aVand try to give you an answer.
p22
aa(lp23
VHere's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon:
p24
aVthe theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
p25
aVWhy do we call it that?
p26
aVBecause it's got all those A's lined up I guess.
p27
aVThis is gobbledygook for
p28
aVif the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge.
p29
aVThey're going to be small.
p30
aVAnd if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner
p31
aVwe're going to kick their ass,
p32
aVwhich is why people don't try to do that any more.
p33
aVI met the last Air Force General who had actually
p34
aVshot down an enemy plane in combat.
p35
aVHe's now a one star General.
p36
aVThat's how distant we are from even meeting an air force
p37
aVwilling to fly against ours.
p38
aVSo that overmatched capability creates problems \u2014
p39
aVcatastrophic successes the White House calls them.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd we're trying to figure that out,
p44
aVbecause it is an amazing capability.
p45
aVThe question is, what's the good you can do with it?
p46
aVOK?
p47
aVThe theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies \u2014
p48
aVgobbledygook that we sell to Congress,
p49
aVbecause if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses
p50
aVthey wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want.
p51
aVSo we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies
p52
aVand their eyes glaze over.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd they say, "Will you build it in my district?"
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VHere's my parody and it ain't much of one.
p63
aVLet's talk about a battle space.
p64
aVI don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.
p65
aVLet's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space.
p66
aVI don't know, the Million Man Swim.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VThe United States has to access that battle space instantaneously.
p71
aVThey throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
p72
aVA banana peel on the tarmac.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VTrojan horses on our computer networks
p77
aVreveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.
p78
aVWe say, "China, it's yours."
p79
aVPrometheus approach, largely a geographic definition,
p80
aVfocuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.
p81
aVWe field the first-half team in a league
p82
aVthat insists on keeping score until the end of the game.
p83
aVThat's the problem.
p84
aVWe can run the score up against anybody,
p85
aVand then get our asses kicked in the second half \u2014
p86
aVwhat they call fourth generation warfare.
p87
aa(lp88
VHere's the way I like to describe it instead.
p89
aVThere is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access.
p90
aVThey said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease.
p91
aVThey said we couldn't do Iraq.
p92
aVWe did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks.
p93
aVWe did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse.
p94
aVThere is nobody we can't take down.
p95
aVThe question is, what do you do with the power?
p96
aa(lp97
VSo there's no trouble accessing battle spaces.
p98
aVWhat we have trouble accessing is the transition space
p99
aVthat must naturally follow,
p100
aVand creating the peace space that allows us to move on.
p101
aVProblem is, the Defense Department over here
p102
aVbeats the hell out of you.
p103
aVThe State Department over here says,
p104
aV"Come on boy, I know you can make it."
p105
aVAnd that poor country runs off that ledge,
p106
aVdoes that cartoon thing and then drops.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force.
p111
aVIt's about non-lethal technologies,
p112
aVbecause if you fire real ammo into a crowd
p113
aVof women and children rioting
p114
aVyou're going to lose friends very quickly.
p115
aVThis is not about projecting power, but about staying power,
p116
aVwhich is about legitimacy with the locals.
p117
aVWho do you access in this transition space?
p118
aa(lp119
VYou have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners.
p120
aVWe asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers.
p121
aVI know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us.
p122
aVBut they said to us, "You know what?
p123
aVIn that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle.
p124
aVWe don't think you can pull it off,
p125
aVwe're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder."
p126
aVWe asked the Russians for 40,000.
p127
aVThey said no.
p128
aVI was in China in August, I said,
p129
aV"You should have 50,000 peace keepers in Iraq.
p130
aVIt's your oil, not ours."
p131
aVWhich is the truth. It's their oil.
p132
aVAnd the Chinese said to me, "Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right.
p133
aVIn a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.
p134
aVBut it's not a perfect world,
p135
aVand your administration isn't getting us any closer."
p136
aVBut we have trouble accessing our outcomes.
p137
aa(lp138
VWe lucked out, frankly, on the selection.
p139
aVWe face different opponents across these three.
p140
aVAnd it's time to start admitting
p141
aVyou can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out.
p142
aVIt's just too damn hard.
p143
aVWe have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
p144
aVWe don't do the everything else so well.
p145
aVFrankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.
p146
aVWe have a brilliant Secretary of War.
p147
aVWe don't have a Secretary of Everything Else.
p148
aVBecause if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate,
p149
aVstill testifying over Abu Ghraib.
p150
aVThe problem is he doesn't exist.
p151
aVThere is no Secretary of Everything Else.
p152
aVI think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
p153
aVI call that the Leviathan Force.
p154
aVWhat we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.
p155
aVI call them the System Administrators.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhat I think this really represents
p158
aVis lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole
p159
aVfor processing politically bankrupt states.
p160
aVWe have one for processing economically bankrupt states.
p161
aVIt's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK?
p162
aVWe argue about it every time we use it.
p163
aVArgentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules.
p164
aVThey got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it."
p165
aVIt's transparent. A certain amount of certainty
p166
aVgives the sense of a non-zero outcome.
p167
aVWe don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states
p168
aVthat, frankly, everybody wants gone.
p169
aVLike Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il \u2014
p170
aVpeople who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.
p171
aVLike the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhat would an A to Z system look like?
p174
aVI'm going to distinguish between what I call
p175
aVfront half and back half.
p176
aVAnd let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VWhat we have extant right now,
p183
aVat the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury.
p184
aVWhat can they do?
p185
aVThey can indict your ass.
p186
aVThey can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper.
p187
aVThey can put it in an envelope and mail it to you,
p188
aVand then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out."
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VThat gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.
p193
aVThat gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months.
p194
aVEverybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day
p195
aVwhat you did about the holocaust in Africa,
p196
aVand you better have an answer.
p197
aVWe don't have anything to translate that will into action.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhat we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says,
p200
aV"You want me to take that guy down? I'll take that guy down.
p201
aVI'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VBut here's the deal.
p206
aVAs soon as I can't find anybody else to air out,
p207
aVI leave the scene immediately.
p208
aVThat's called the Powell Doctrine.
p209
aVWay downstream we have the International Criminal Court.
p210
aVThey love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevi\u0107 right now.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhat are we missing?
p213
aVA functioning executive that will translate will into action,
p214
aVbecause we don't have it.
p215
aVEvery time we lead one of these efforts
p216
aVwe have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing.
p217
aVWe haven't faced an imminent threat since
p218
aVthe Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
p219
aVBut we use this language from a bygone era
p220
aVto scare ourselves into doing something
p221
aVbecause we're a democracy and that's what it takes.
p222
aVAnd if that doesn't work we scream, "He's got a gun!"
p223
aVjust as we rush in.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd then we look over the body
p228
aVand we find an old cigarette lighter and we say,
p229
aV"Jesus, it was dark."
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VDo you want to do it, France?
p234
aVFrance says, "No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact."
p235
aa(lp236
VWhat we need downstream is a great power enabled \u2014
p237
aVwhat I call that Sys Admin Force.
p238
aVWe should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq
p239
aVon the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad.
p240
aVWhat do you get then?
p241
aVNo looting, no military disappearing,
p242
aVno arms disappearing, no ammo disappearing,
p243
aVno Muqtada Al-Sadr \u2014 I'm wrecking his bones \u2014
p244
aVno insurgency.
p245
aVTalk to anybody who was over there in the first six months.
p246
aVWe had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done,
p247
aVand we dicked around for six months.
p248
aVAnd then they turned on us.
p249
aVWhy? Because they just got fed up.
p250
aVThey saw what we did to Saddam.
p251
aVThey said, "You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country.
p252
aVYou're America."
p253
aa(lp254
VWhat we need is an international reconstruction fund \u2014
p255
aVSebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea.
p256
aVModel on the IMF.
p257
aVInstead of passing the hat each time, OK?
p258
aVWhere are we going to find this guy? G20, that's easy.
p259
aVCheck out their agenda since 9/11.
p260
aVAll security dominated.
p261
aVThey're going to decide up front how the money gets spent
p262
aVjust like in the IMF.
p263
aVYou vote according to how much money you put in the kitty.
p264
aVHere's my challenge to the Defense Department.
p265
aVYou've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force.
p266
aVYou've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success.
p267
aVYou will get this model.
p268
aVYou tell me it's too hard to do.
p269
aVI'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans.
p270
aVWe did it just like that.
p271
aVI'm talking about regularizing it, making it transparent.
p272
aVWould you like Mugabe gone?
p273
aVWould you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people,
p274
aVwould you like him gone?
p275
aVWould you like a better system?
p276
aVThis is why it matters to the military.
p277
aVThey've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War.
p278
aVI'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire,
p279
aVwhich I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VI'm talking about the 1990s.
p284
aVThe Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm.
p285
aVThe split starts to emerge between those in the military
p286
aVwho see a future they can live with,
p287
aVand those who see a future that starts to scare them,
p288
aVlike the U.S. submarine community,
p289
aVwhich watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight.
p290
aVAh!
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VSo they start moving from reality towards desire
p295
aVand they create their own special language
p296
aVto describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VThe problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against.
p301
aVAnd if you can't find one you've got to make one up.
p302
aVChina, all grown up, going to be a looker!
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VThe rest of the military got dragged down into the muck
p307
aVacross the 1990s
p308
aVand they developed this very derisive term to describe it:
p309
aVmilitary operations other than war.
p310
aVI ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war?
p311
aVActually, most of them.
p312
aVJessica Lynch never planned on shooting back.
p313
aVMost of them don't pick up a rifle.
p314
aVI maintain this is code inside the Army for,
p315
aV"We don't want to do this."
p316
aVThey spent the 1990s working the messy scene
p317
aVbetween globalized parts of the world
p318
aVWhat I call the core and the gap.
p319
aVThe Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this.
p320
aVFor eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one \u2014
p321
aVinauguration day with gays in the military \u2014
p322
aVwhich was deft.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VSo we were home alone for eight years.
p327
aVAnd what did we do home alone?
p328
aVWe bought one military and we operated another.
p329
aVIt's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says,
p330
aV"Doctor, it hurts when I do this."
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VThe doctor says, "Stop doing that you idiot."
p335
aa(lp336
VI used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.
p337
aVI'd say, "You're buying one military and you're operating another,
p338
aVand eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong.
p339
aVBad Pentagon, bad!"
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd they'd say, "Dr. Barnett, you are so right.
p344
aVCan you come back next year and remind us again?"
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VSome people say 9/11 heals the rift \u2014
p349
aVjerks the long-term transformation gurus
p350
aVout of their 30,000 foot view of history,
p351
aVdrags them down in to the muck and says, "You want a networked opponent?
p352
aVI've got one, he's everywhere, go find him."
p353
aVIt elevates MOOTW \u2014 how we pronounce that acronym \u2014
p354
aVfrom crap to grand strategy,
p355
aVbecause that's how you're going to shrink that gap.
p356
aa(lp357
VSome people put these two things together
p358
aVand they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept.
p359
aVEmpire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets,
p360
aVwhich you cannot do,
p361
aVbut maximum rule sets which you must do.
p362
aVIt's not our system of governance.
p363
aVNever how we've sought to interact with the outside world.
p364
aVI prefer that phrase System Administration.
p365
aVWe enforce the minimal rule sets
p366
aVfor maintaining connectivity to the global economy.
p367
aVCertain bad things you cannot do.
p368
aVHow this impacts the way we think about the future of war.
p369
aVThis is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon.
p370
aVIt makes me very popular as well.
p371
aVEverybody's got an opinion.
p372
aa(lp373
VGoing back to the beginning of our country \u2014
p374
aVhistorically, defenses meant protection of the homeland.
p375
aVSecurity has meant everything else.
p376
aVWritten into our constitution,
p377
aVtwo different forces, two different functions.
p378
aVRaise an army when you need it,
p379
aVand maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity.
p380
aVA Department of War, a Department of Everything Else.
p381
aVA big stick, a baton stick.
p382
aVCan of whup ass,
p383
aVthe networking force.
p384
aVIn 1947 we merged these two things together
p385
aVin the Defense Department.
p386
aVOur long-term rationale becomes,
p387
aVwe're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets.
p388
aVTo attack America is to risk blowing up the world.
p389
aVWe connected national security to international security
p390
aVwith about a seven minute time delay.
p391
aVThat's not our problem now.
p392
aVThey can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow
p393
aVand we don't go to the mattresses with nukes.
p394
aVThat's the scary part.
p395
aa(lp396
VThe question is how do we reconnect American national security
p397
aVwith global security to make the world a lot more comfortable,
p398
aVand to embed and contextualize our employment
p399
aVof force around the planet?
p400
aVWhat's happened since is that bifurcation I described.
p401
aVWe talked about this going all the way back
p402
aVto the end of the Cold War.
p403
aVLet's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else.
p404
aVSome people say, "Hell, 9/11 did it for you."
p405
aVNow we've got a home game and an away game.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VThe Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure.
p410
aVIt's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century.
p411
aVTSA \u2014 thousands standing around.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Laughter)
p414
aa(lp415
VI supported the war in Iraq.
p416
aVHe was a bad guy with multiple priors.
p417
aVIt's not like we had to find him
p418
aVactually killing somebody live to arrest him.
p419
aVI knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force.
p420
aVI knew we'd have a hard time with what followed.
p421
aVBut I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure.
p422
aVWhat do I mean by these two different forces?
p423
aa(lp424
VThis is the Hobbesian Force.
p425
aVI love this force. I don't want to see it go.
p426
aVThat plus nukes rules out great power war.
p427
aVThis is the military the rest of the world wants us to build.
p428
aVIt's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.
p429
aa(lp430
VWhat does this mean?
p431
aVIt means you've got to stop pretending
p432
aVyou can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old.
p433
aVSwitching back, morning, afternoon, evening,
p434
aVmorning, afternoon, evening.
p435
aVHanding out aid, shooting back,
p436
aVhanding out aid, shooting back.
p437
aVIt's too much.
p438
aVThe 19-year-olds get tired from the switching, OK?
p439
aa(lp440
V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VThat force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that.
p443
aVThat force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop.
p444
aVYou need the experience.
p445
aVWhat does this mean in terms of operations?
p446
aa(lp447
VThe rule is going to be this.
p448
aVThat Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home,
p449
aVdoes most of your work.
p450
aVYou break out that Leviathan Force only every so often.
p451
aVBut here's the promise you make to the American public,
p452
aVto your own people, to the world.
p453
aVYou break out that Leviathan Force,
p454
aVyou promise, you guarantee that you're going to mount
p455
aVone hell of a \u2014 immediately \u2014 follow-on Sys Admin effort.
p456
aVDon't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.
p457

V(Applause)

aa(lp460
VOther differences. Leviathan

aVtraditional partners, they all look like the Brits
p462
aVand their former colonies.
p463
aa(lp464
V(Laughter)
p465
aa(lp466
VIncluding us, I would remind you.
p467
aVThe rest \u2014 wider array of partners.
p468
aVInternational organizations, non-governmental organizations,
p469
aVprivate voluntary organizations, contractors.
p470
aVYou're not going to get away from that.
p471
aVLeviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services.
p472
aVWe're done with that.
p473
aVWhat we need to do is inter-agency operations,
p474
aVwhich frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.
p475
aVAnd I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.
p476
aa(lp477
VI call the Leviathan Force your dad's military.
p478
aVI like them young, male, unmarried, slightly pissed off.
p479
aa(lp480
V(Laughter)
p481
aa(lp482
VI call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military.
p483
aVIt's everything the man's military hates.
p484
aVGender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children.
p485
aVThe force on the left, up or out.
p486
aVThe force on the right, in and out.
p487
aVThe force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions
p488
aVon the use of force inside the U.S.
p489
aVThe force on the right's going to obliterate it.
p490
aVThat's where the National Guard's going to be.
p491
aVThe force on the left is never coming under the purview
p492
aVof the International Criminal Court.
p493
aVSys Admin Force has to.
p494
aVDifferent definitions of network centricity.
p495
aVOne takes down networks, one puts them up.
p496
aVAnd you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.
p497
aa(lp498
VDo we need a bigger budget?
p499
aVDo we need a draft to pull this off?
p500
aVAbsolutely not.
p501
aVI've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years,
p502
aVwe can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal.
p503
aVI say, "Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide."
p504
aa(lp505
VHere's the larger point.
p506
aVYou're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first.
p507
aVBut ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds.
p508
aVInter agency-ize it, internationalize it.
p509
aVSo yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,
p510
aVbut over time it's going to cross that river.
p511
aa(lp512
V(Laughter)
p513
aa(lp514
VI have been to the mountain top. I can see the future.
p515
aVI may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen.
p516
aVWe're going to have a Department of Something Else
p517
aVbetween war and peace.
p518
aa(lp519
VLast slide.
p520
aVWho gets custody of the kids?
p521
aVThis is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense.
p522
aV(Laughter)
p523
aVAnd this is when they think about beating the crap out of me
p524
aVafter the talk.
p525
aa(lp526
V(Laughter)
p527
aa(lp528
VRead Max Boon.
p529
aVThis is the history of the marines \u2014 small wars, small arms.
p530
aVThe Marines are like my West Highland Terrier.
p531
aVThey get up every morning, they want to dig a hole
p532
aVand they want to kill something.
p533
aa(lp534
V(Laughter)
p535
aa(lp536
VI don't want my Marines handing out aid.
p537
aVI want them to be Marines.
p538
aVThat's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force.
p539
aVIt keeps it from being the U.N.
p540
aVYou shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you.
p541
aa(lp542
V(Laughter)
p543
aa(lp544
V(Applause)
p545
aa(lp546
VDepartment of Navy, strategic subs go this way,
p547
aVsurface combatants are over there,
p548
aVand the news is they may actually be that small.
p549
aa(lp550
V(Laughter)
p551
aa(lp552
VI call it the Smart Dust Navy.
p553
aVI tell young officers, "You may command 500 ships in your career.
p554
aVBad news is they may not have anybody on them."
p555
aVCarriers go both ways because they're a swing asset.
p556
aVYou'll see the pattern \u2014 airborne, just like carriers.
p557
aVArmor goes this way.
p558
aVHere's the dirty secret of the Air Force,
p559
aVyou can win by bombing.
p560
aVBut you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace.
p561
aVShinseki was right with the argument.
p562
aVAir force, strategic airlift goes both ways.
p563
aVBombers, fighters go over here.
p564
aVSpecial Operations Command down at Tampa.
p565
aVTrigger-pullers go this way.
p566
aVCivil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here.
p567
aVReturn to the Army.
p568
aVThe point about the trigger-pullers and Special Operations Command.
p569
aVNo off season, these guys are always active.
p570
aVThey drop in, do their business, disappear.
p571
aVSee me now. Don't talk about it later.
p572
aa(lp573
V(Laughter)
p574
aa(lp575
VI was never here.
p576
aa(lp577
V(Laughter)
p578
aa(lp579
VThe world is my playground.
p580
aa(lp581
V(Laughter)
p582
aa(lp583
VI want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy.
p584
aVI want the rules to be as loose as possible.
p585
aVBecause when the thing gets prevented in Chicago
p586
aVwith the three million dead
p587
aVthat perverts our political system beyond all recognition,
p588
aVthese are the guys who are going to kill them first.
p589
aVSo it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way
p590
aVthan to see that.
p591
aa(lp592
VReserve component \u2014
p593
aVNational Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin.
p594
aVHow are you going to get them to work for this force?
p595
aVMost firemen in this country do it for free.
p596
aVThis is not about money.
p597
aVThis is about being up front with these guys and gals.
p598
aa(lp599
VLast point, intelligence community \u2014
p600
aVthe muscle and the defense agencies go this way.
p601
aVWhat should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source
p602
aVshould come over here.
p603
aVThe information you need to do this is not secret.
p604
aVIt's not secret.
p605
aVRead that great piece in the New Yorker
p606
aVabout how our echo boomers, 19 to 25, over in Iraq
p607
aVtaught each other how to do Sys Admin work,
p608
aVover the Internet in chat rooms.
p609
aVThey said, "Al Qaeda could be listening."
p610
aVThey said, "Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff."
p611
aa(lp612
V(Laughter)
p613
aa(lp614
VTake a gift in the left hand.
p615
aVThese are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff.
