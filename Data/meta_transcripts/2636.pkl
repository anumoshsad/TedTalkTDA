VThis picture
p4
aVis from my metro card
p5
aVwhen I spent a year abroad in Paris in college in the mid-'90s.
p6
aVMy friend says I look like a French anarchist \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut this is still what I see
p11
aVwhen I look in the mirror in the morning.
p12
aVWithin a month of living in Paris, I'd lost 15 pounds
p13
aVand I was in the best shape of my life
p14
aVbecause I was eating fresh food
p15
aVand I was walking wherever I went.
p16
aa(lp17
VHaving grown up in suburban Atlanta,
p18
aVa region built largely by highways and automobiles
p19
aVand with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl,
p20
aVParis fundamentally changed the way I understood
p21
aVthe construction of the world around me,
p22
aVand I got obsessed with the role of infrastructure \u2014
p23
aVthat it's not just the way to move people from point A to point B,
p24
aVit's not just the way to convey water or sewage or energy,
p25
aVbut it's the foundation for our economy.
p26
aVIt's the foundation for our social life and for our culture,
p27
aVand it really matters to the way that we live.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen I came home, I was instantly frustrated,
p30
aVstuck in traffic as I crossed the top end of our perimeter highway.
p31
aVNot only was I not moving a muscle,
p32
aVI had no social interaction
p33
aVwith the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me,
p34
aVlike me, with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring.
p35
aVI wondered if this was an inevitable outcome,
p36
aVor could we do something about it.
p37
aVWas it possible to transform this condition in Atlanta
p38
aVinto the kind of place that I wanted to live in?
p39
aa(lp40
VI went back to grad school in architecture and city planning,
p41
aVdeveloped this interest in infrastructure,
p42
aVand in 1999 came up with an idea
p43
aVfor my thesis project:
p44
aVthe adaptation of an obsolete loop of old railroad circling downtown
p45
aVas a new infrastructure for urban revitalization.
p46
aVIt was just an idea.
p47
aVI never thought we would actually build it.
p48
aVBut I went to work at an architecture firm,
p49
aVand eventually talked to my coworkers about it,
p50
aVand they loved the idea.
p51
aVAnd as we started talking to more people about it,
p52
aVmore people wanted to hear about it.
p53
aa(lp54
VIn the summer of 2001,
p55
aVwe connected with Cathy Woolard,
p56
aVwho was soon elected city council president.
p57
aVAnd we built a citywide vision around this idea:
p58
aVthe Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop
p59
aVof transit and trails and transformation.
p60
aVI was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years,
p61
aVand so was Cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers.
p62
aVTogether, we built this amazing movement of people and ideas.
p63
aVIt included community advocates who were used to fighting against things,
p64
aVbut found the Atlanta BeltLine as something that they could fight for;
p65
aVdevelopers who saw the opportunity
p66
aVto take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city;
p67
aVand dozens of nonprofit partners who saw their mission
p68
aVat least partly accomplished by the shared vision.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, usually these groups of people aren't at the same table
p71
aVwanting the same outcome.
p72
aVBut there we were, and it was kind of weird,
p73
aVbut it was really, really powerful.
p74
aVThe people of Atlanta fell in love with a vision
p75
aVthat was better than what they saw through their car windshields,
p76
aVand the people of Atlanta made it happen,
p77
aVand I guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise.
p78
aa(lp79
VFrom the beginning, our coalition was diverse.
p80
aVPeople of all stripes were part of our story.
p81
aVPeople on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it, too.
p82
aVThey were just afraid they weren't going to be able to be there
p83
aVwhen it got built, that they'd be priced out.
p84
aVAnd we've all heard that kind of story before, right?
p85
aVBut we promised that the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,
p86
aVand people took ownership of the idea,
p87
aVand they made it better than anything we ever imagined
p88
aVin the beginning,
p89
aVincluding significant subsidies for housing,
p90
aVnew parks, art, an arboretum \u2014 a list that continues to grow.
p91
aVAnd we put in place
p92
aVthe organizations and agencies that were required to make it happen.
p93
aVAnd importantly, it is.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow we're in the early stages of implementation, and it's working.
p96
aVThe first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012,
p97
aVand it's already generated over three billion dollars
p98
aVof private-sector investment.
p99
aVBut it's not only changing the physical form of the city,
p100
aVit's changing the way we think about the city,
p101
aVand what our expectations are for living there.
p102
aVAbout a month ago,
p103
aVI had to take my kids with me to the grocery store
p104
aVand they were complaining about it,
p105
aVbecause they didn't want to get in the car.
p106
aVThey were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,
p107
aVcan we at least ride our bikes?"
p108
aVAnd I said, "Of course we can.
p109
aVThat's what people in Atlanta do.
p110
aVWe ride our bikes to the grocery store."
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VThank you, yeah.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, they don't know how ridiculous that is,
p119
aVbut I do.
p120
aVAnd I also understand that their expectations for Atlanta
p121
aVare really powerful.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl
p124
aVin the last century,
p125
aVthe movement where our investment in highways and automobiles
p126
aVfundamentally changed American life.
p127
aVThat wasn't some grand conspiracy.
p128
aVThere were conspiracies within it, of course.
p129
aVBut it was a cultural momentum.
p130
aVIt was millions of people making millions of decisions
p131
aVover an extended period of time,
p132
aVthat fundamentally changed not only the way that we build cities,
p133
aVbut it changed our expectations
p134
aVfor our lives.
p135
aVThese changes were the foundations for urban sprawl.
p136
aVWe didn't call it sprawl at that time.
p137
aVWe called it the future.
p138
aVAnd it was.
p139
aVAnd we got all the highways and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.
p140
aa(lp141
VIt was a radical transformation,
p142
aVbut it was built by a cultural momentum.
p143
aVSo it's important to not separate
p144
aVthe physical construction of the places we live
p145
aVfrom other things that are happening at that time.
p146
aVAt that time,
p147
aVin the second half of the last century,
p148
aVscience was curing disease
p149
aVand lifting us to the moon,
p150
aVand the sexual revolution was breaking down barriers,
p151
aVand the Civil Rights Movement began its march
p152
aVtoward the fulfillment of our nation's promise.
p153
aVTelevision, entertainment, food, travel, business \u2014 everything was changing,
p154
aVand both the public and private sectors were colluding
p155
aVto give us the lives we wanted.
p156
aVThe Federal Highway Administration,
p157
aVfor example, didn't exist before there were highways.
p158
aVThink about it.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VOf course, today it's important to understand and acknowledge
p163
aVthat those benefits accrued to some groups of people
p164
aVand not to others.
p165
aVIt was not an equitable cultural momentum.
p166
aVBut when we look today in wonder and disgust, maybe,
p167
aVat the metropolis sprawl before us,
p168
aVwe wonder if we're stuck.
p169
aVAre we stuck with the legacy of that inequity?
p170
aVAre we stuck with this dystopian traffic hellscape?
p171
aVAre we stuck with rampant urban displacement,
p172
aVwith environmental degradation?
p173
aVAre we stuck with social isolation
p174
aVor political polarization?
p175
aVAre these the inevitable and permanent outcomes?
p176
aVOr are they the result of our collective cultural decisions
p177
aVthat we've made for ourselves?
p178
aVAnd if they are,
p179
aVcan't we change them?
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat I have learned from our experience in Atlanta
p182
aVis not an anomaly.
p183
aVSimilar stories are playing out everywhere,
p184
aVwhere people are reclaiming not only old railroads,
p185
aVbut also degraded urban waterways and obsolete roadways,
p186
aVreinventing all of the infrastructure
p187
aVin their lives.
p188
aVWhether here in New York
p189
aVor in Houston
p190
aVor Miami,
p191
aVDetroit, Philadelphia,
p192
aVSeoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,
p193
aVToronto and Paris,
p194
aVcities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing
p195
aVthis infrastructure for themselves,
p196
aVincluding the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects,
p197
aVthe Los Angeles River,
p198
aVthe revitalization effort for which similarly started
p199
aVas a grassroots movement,
p200
aVhas developed into a cultural momentum,
p201
aVand is now in the early stages of being transformed
p202
aVinto some kind of life-affirming infrastructure again,
p203
aVthis one with trails and parks and fishing and boating
p204
aVand community revitalization,
p205
aVand of course, water quality and flood control.
p206
aVIt's already improving the lives of people.
p207
aVIt's already changing the way the rest of us think about Los Angeles.
p208
aa(lp209
VThis is more than just infrastructure.
p210
aVWe're building new lives for ourselves.
p211
aVIt's a movement that includes local food, urban agriculture,
p212
aVcraft beer, the maker movement,
p213
aVtech and design \u2014 all of these things, early indicators of a really radical shift
p214
aVin the way we build cities.
p215
aVWe're taking places like this
p216
aVand transforming them into this.
p217
aVAnd soon this.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd this is all exciting and good.
p220
aVWe're changing the world for the better.
p221
aVGood for us!
p222
aVAnd it is awesome \u2014 I mean that.
p223
aVBut our history of sprawl,
p224
aVand from what we can already see with these catalyst projects today,
p225
aVwe know and must remember
p226
aVthat big changes like this don't usually benefit everyone.
p227
aVThe market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum
p228
aVoften include the seemingly unstoppable
p229
aVand inevitable cycle of rising taxes, prices and rents.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is urgent.
p232
aVIf we care, we have to stand up
p233
aVand speak out.
p234
aVThis should be a call to action,
p235
aVbecause the answer can't be to not improve communities.
p236
aVThe answer can't be to not build parks and transit and grocery stores.
p237
aVThe answer can't be to hold communities down
p238
aVjust to keep them affordable.
p239
aVBut we do have to follow through and address the financial realities
p240
aVthat we're facing.
p241
aVThis is hard, and it won't happen on its own.
p242
aVWe can do it, and I'm committed to this goal in Atlanta,
p243
aVto sticking up again for people who made it possible in the first place.
p244
aVWe can't call it a success without them.
p245
aVI certainly can't,
p246
aVbecause the people I made commitments to all those years
p247
aVweren't abstract populations.
p248
aVThey're my friends and neighbors.
p249
aVThey're people that I love.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo even though it started as my graduate thesis
p252
aVand I'm working hard for 16 years with thousands of people
p253
aVto help make this thing come to life,
p254
aVI know and believe that who the BeltLine is being built for
p255
aVis just as important as whether it's built at all.
p256
aVNot just in Atlanta,
p257
aVbut locally and globally,
p258
aVwe have to understand
p259
aVthis accountability to the people whose lives we are changing,
p260
aVbecause this is us.
p261
aVWe are the lives we're talking about.
p262
aVThese places aren't inevitable.
p263
aVThe places we live aren't inevitable,
p264
aVand if we want something different, we just need to speak up.
p265
aVWe have to ensure that change comes on our terms.
p266
aVAnd to do that,
p267
aVwe have to participate actively in the process of shaping change.
p268
aa(lp269
