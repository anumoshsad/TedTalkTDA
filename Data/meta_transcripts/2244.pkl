VThe brain is an amazing and complex organ.
p4
aVAnd while many people are fascinated by the brain,
p5
aVthey can't really tell you that much
p6
aVabout the properties about how the brain works
p7
aVbecause we don't teach neuroscience in schools.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd one of the reasons why is that the equipment
p10
aVis so complex and so expensive
p11
aVthat it's really only done at major universities and large institutions.
p12
aVAnd so in order to be able to access the brain,
p13
aVyou really need to dedicate your life
p14
aVand spend six and a half years as a graduate student
p15
aVjust to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd that's a shame because one out of five of us,
p18
aVthat's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder.
p19
aVAnd there are zero cures for these diseases.
p20
aVAnd so it seems that what we should be doing
p21
aVis reaching back earlier in the eduction process
p22
aVand teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future,
p23
aVthey may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhen I was a graduate student, my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,
p26
aVdecided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have
p27
aVfor studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough
p28
aVthat anyone that you know, an amateur or a high school student,
p29
aVcould learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so we did just that.
p32
aVA few years ago, we started a company called Backyard Brains
p33
aVand we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight,
p34
aVand I want to do some demonstrations.
p35
aVYou guys want to see some?
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I need a volunteer.
p38
aVSo right before \u2014 what is your name? (Applause)
p39
aVSam Kelly: Sam.
p40
aVGreg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going to record from your brain.
p41
aVHave you had this before?
p42
aVSK: No.
p43
aVGG: I need you to stick out your arm for science,
p44
aVroll up your sleeve a bit,
p45
aVSo what I'm going to do, I'm putting electrodes on your arm,
p46
aVand you're probably wondering,
p47
aVI just said I'm going to record from your brain, what am I doing with your arm?
p48
aa(lp49
VWell, you have about 80 billion neurons inside your brain right now.
p50
aVThey're sending electrical messages back and forth, and chemical messages.
p51
aVBut some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex
p52
aVare going to send messages down when you move your arm like this.
p53
aVThey're going to go down across your corpus callosum,
p54
aVdown onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron
p55
aVout to your muscles here,
p56
aVand that electrical discharge is going to be picked up
p57
aVby these electrodes right here
p58
aVand we're going to be able to listen
p59
aVto exactly what your brain is going to be doing.
p60
aVSo I'm going to turn this on for a second.
p61
aa(lp62
VHave you ever heard what your brain sounds like?
p63
aVSK: No.
p64
aVGG: Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand.
p65
aV(Rumbling)
p66
aVSo what you're listening to,
p67
aVso this is your motor units happening right here.
p68
aVLet's take a look at it as well.
p69
aVSo I'm going to stand over here,
p70
aVand I'm going to open up our app here.
p71
aVSo now I want you to squeeze.
p72
aV(Rumbling)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo right here, these are the motor units that are happening
p75
aVfrom her spinal cord out to her muscle right here,
p76
aVand as she's doing it,
p77
aVyou're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here.
p78
aVYou can even click here and try to see one of them.
p79
aVSo keep doing it really hard.
p80
aVSo now we've paused
p81
aVon one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain.
p82
aa(lp83
VDo you guys want to see some more?
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVThat's interesting, but let's get it better.
p86
aVI need one more volunteer.
p87
aVWhat is your name, sir?
p88
aVMiguel Goncalves: Miguel.
p89
aVGG: Miguel, all right.
p90
aVYou're going to stand right here.
p91
aVSo when you're moving your arm like this,
p92
aVyour brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here.
p93
aVI want you to move your arm as well.
p94
aVSo your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles.
p95
aVAnd so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here
p96
aVthat runs up here that innervates these three fingers,
p97
aVand it's close enough to the skin that we might be able
p98
aVto stimulate that so that what we can do
p99
aVis copy your brain signals going out to your hand
p100
aVand inject it into your hand,
p101
aVso that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move.
p102
aVSo in a sense, she will take away your free will
p103
aVand you will no longer have any control over this hand.
p104
aVYou with me?
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I just need to hook you up.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVSo I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,
p109
aVwhich is probably right around here.
p110
aVYou don't know what you're signing up for
p111
aVwhen you come up.
p112
aVSo now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in
p113
aVto our human-to-human interface over here.
p114
aa(lp115
VOkay, so Sam, I want you to squeeze your hand again.
p116
aVDo it again. Perfect.
p117
aVSo now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the \u2014
p118
aVIt's going to feel a little bit weird at first,
p119
aVthis is going to feel like a \u2014 (Laughter)
p120
aVYou know, when you lose your free will, and someone else becomes your agent,
p121
aVit does feel a bit strange.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow I want you to relax your hand.
p124
aVSam, you're with me?
p125
aVSo you're going to squeeze.
p126
aVI'm not going to turn it on yet, so go ahead and give it a squeeze.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo now, are you ready, Miguel?
p129
aVMG: Ready as I'll ever be.
p130
aVGG: I've turned it on, so go ahead and turn your hand.
p131
aVDo you feel that a little bit? MG: Nope.
p132
aVGG: Okay, do it again? MG: A little bit.
p133
aVGG: A little bit? (Laughter)
p134
aVSo relax.
p135
aVSo hit it again.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVOh, perfect, perfect.
p138
aVSo relax, do it again.
p139
aa(lp140
VAll right, so right now,
p141
aVyour brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm,
p142
aVso go ahead and just do it one more time.
p143
aVAll right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo now, what would happen if I took over my control of your hand?
p146
aVAnd so, just relax your hand.
p147
aVWhat happens?
p148
aVAh, nothing.
p149
aVWhy not?
p150
aVBecause the brain has to do it.
p151
aVSo you do it again.
p152
aVAll right, that's perfect.
p153
aa(lp154
VThank you guys for being such a good sport.
p155
aVThis is what's happening all across the world \u2014
p156
aVelectrophysiology!
p157
aVWe're going to bring on the neuro-revolution.
p158
aa(lp159
