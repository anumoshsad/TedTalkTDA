VI'm here to give you
p4
aVyour recommended dietary allowance
p5
aVof poetry.
p6
aVAnd the way I'm going to do that
p7
aVis present to you
p8
aVfive animations
p9
aVof five of my poems.
p10
aVAnd let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.
p11
aVBecause the mixing of those two media
p12
aVis a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut when I was United States Poet Laureate \u2014
p15
aVand I love saying that.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVIt's a great way to start sentences.
p18
aVWhen I was him back then,
p19
aVI was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,
p20
aVand they were hired
p21
aVsort of by the Sundance Channel.
p22
aVAnd the idea was to have me record some of my poems
p23
aVand then they would find animators
p24
aVto animate them.
p25
aVAnd I was initially resistant,
p26
aVbecause I always think
p27
aVpoetry can stand alone by itself.
p28
aVAttempts to put my poems to music
p29
aVhave had disastrous results,
p30
aVin all cases.
p31
aVAnd the poem, if it's written with the ear,
p32
aValready has been set to its own verbal music
p33
aVas it was composed.
p34
aVAnd surely, if you're reading a poem
p35
aVthat mentions a cow,
p36
aVyou don't need on the facing page
p37
aVa drawing of a cow.
p38
aVI mean, let's let the reader do a little work.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,
p41
aVand also I'm like a total cartoon junkie
p42
aVsince childhood.
p43
aVI think more influential
p44
aVthan Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth
p45
aVon my imagination
p46
aVwere Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies
p47
aVand Loony Tunes cartoons.
p48
aVBugs Bunny is my muse.
p49
aVAnd this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.
p50
aVAnd I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places \u2014
p51
aVpoetry on buses, poetry on subways,
p52
aVon billboards, on cereal boxes.
p53
aVWhen I was Poet Laureate, there I go again \u2014
p54
aVI can't help it, it's true \u2014
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVI created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines
p57
aVthat lasted for a couple of years.
p58
aVSo you could tune into poetry as you were flying.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd my sense is,
p61
aVit's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves
p62
aVand more into public life.
p63
aVStart a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.
p64
aVWhen you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio
p65
aVor on a cereal box or whatever,
p66
aVit happens to you so suddenly
p67
aVthat you don't have time
p68
aVto deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields
p69
aVthat were installed in high school.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo let us start with the first one.
p72
aVIt's a little poem called "Budapest,"
p73
aVand in it I reveal,
p74
aVor pretend to reveal,
p75
aVthe secrets of the creative process.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Video) Narration: "Budapest."
p78
aVMy pen moves along the page
p79
aVlike the snout of a strange animal
p80
aVshaped like a human arm
p81
aVand dressed in the sleeve
p82
aVof a loose green sweater.
p83
aVI watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,
p84
aVintent as any forager
p85
aVthat has nothing on its mind
p86
aVbut the grubs and insects
p87
aVthat will allow it to live another day.
p88
aVIt wants only to be here tomorrow,
p89
aVdressed perhaps
p90
aVin the sleeve of a plaid shirt,
p91
aVnose pressed against the page,
p92
aVwriting a few more dutiful lines
p93
aVwhile I gaze out the window
p94
aVand imagine Budapest
p95
aVor some other city
p96
aVwhere I have never been.
p97
aa(lp98
VBC: So that makes it seem a little easier.
p99
aV(Applause)
p100
aVWriting is not actually as easy as that for me.
p101
aVBut I like to pretend that it comes with ease.
p102
aVOne of my students came up after class, an introductory class,
p103
aVand she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"
p104
aVwhich I found both erroneous and profound.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVSo I like to at least pretend it just flows out.
p107
aVA friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.
p108
aVHe says that, "If at first you don't succeed,
p109
aVhide all evidence you ever tried."
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThe next poem is also rather short.
p114
aVPoetry just says a few things in different ways.
p115
aVAnd I think you could boil this poem down to saying,
p116
aV"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."
p117
aVAnd it uses the imagery
p118
aVof dollhouse furniture.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Video) Narration: "Some Days."
p121
aVSome days
p122
aVI put the people in their places at the table,
p123
aVbend their legs at the knees,
p124
aVif they come with that feature,
p125
aVand fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.
p126
aVAll afternoon they face one another,
p127
aVthe man in the brown suit,
p128
aVthe woman in the blue dress \u2014
p129
aVperfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.
p130
aVBut other days I am the one
p131
aVwho is lifted up by the ribs
p132
aVthen lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse
p133
aVto sit with the others at the long table.
p134
aVVery funny.
p135
aVBut how would you like it
p136
aVif you never knew from one day to the next
p137
aVif you were going to spend it
p138
aVstriding around like a vivid god,
p139
aVyour shoulders in the clouds,
p140
aVor sitting down there
p141
aVamidst the wallpaper
p142
aVstaring straight ahead
p143
aVwith your little plastic face?
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VBC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
p148
aVThe next poem is called forgetfulness,
p149
aVand it's really just a kind of poetic essay
p150
aVon the subject of mental slippage.
p151
aVAnd the poem begins
p152
aVwith a certain species of forgetfulness
p153
aVthat someone called
p154
aVliterary amnesia,
p155
aVin other words, forgetting the things that you have read.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."
p158
aVThe name of the author is the first to go,
p159
aVfollowed obediently
p160
aVby the title, the plot,
p161
aVthe heartbreaking conclusion,
p162
aVthe entire novel,
p163
aVwhich suddenly becomes one you have never read,
p164
aVnever even heard of.
p165
aVIt is as if, one by one,
p166
aVthe memories you used to harbor
p167
aVdecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain
p168
aVto a little fishing village
p169
aVwhere there are no phones.
p170
aVLong ago,
p171
aVyou kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye
p172
aVand you watched the quadratic equation
p173
aVpack its bag.
p174
aVAnd even now,
p175
aVas you memorize the order of the planets,
p176
aVsomething else is slipping away,
p177
aVa state flower perhaps,
p178
aVthe address of an uncle,
p179
aVthe capital of Paraguay.
p180
aVWhatever it is
p181
aVyou are struggling to remember,
p182
aVit is not poised on the tip of your tongue,
p183
aVnot even lurking
p184
aVin some obscure corner
p185
aVof your spleen.
p186
aVIt has floated away
p187
aVdown a dark mythological river
p188
aVwhose name begins with an L
p189
aVas far as you can recall,
p190
aVwell on your own way to oblivion
p191
aVwhere you will join those
p192
aVwho have forgotten even how to swim
p193
aVand how to ride a bicycle.
p194
aVNo wonder you rise in the middle of the night
p195
aVto look up the date of a famous battle
p196
aVin a book on war.
p197
aVNo wonder the Moon in the window
p198
aVseems to have drifted out of a love poem
p199
aVthat you used to know by heart.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VBC: The next poem is called "The Country"
p204
aVand it's based on,
p205
aVwhen I was in college
p206
aVI met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.
p207
aVHe lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.
p208
aVI lived in New York City.
p209
aVAnd we would visit each other.
p210
aVAnd when I would go up to the country,
p211
aVhe would teach me things like deer hunting,
p212
aVwhich meant getting lost with a gun basically \u2014
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVand trout fishing and stuff like that.
p215
aVAnd then he'd come down to New York City
p216
aVand I'd teach him what I knew,
p217
aVwhich was largely smoking and drinking.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVAnd in that way we traded lore with each other.
p220
aVThe poem that's coming up
p221
aVis based on him trying to tell me a little something
p222
aVabout a domestic point of etiquette
p223
aVin country living
p224
aVthat I had a very hard time, at first, processing.
p225
aVIt's called "The Country."
p226
aa(lp227
V(Video) Narration: "The Country."
p228
aVI wondered about you
p229
aVwhen you told me never to leave
p230
aVa box of wooden strike-anywhere matches
p231
aVjust lying around the house,
p232
aVbecause the mice might get into them
p233
aVand start a fire.
p234
aVBut your face was absolutely straight
p235
aVwhen you twisted the lid down
p236
aVon the round tin
p237
aVwhere the matches, you said, are always stowed.
p238
aVWho could sleep that night?
p239
aVWho could whisk away the thought
p240
aVof the one unlikely mouse
p241
aVpadding along a cold water pipe
p242
aVbehind the floral wallpaper,
p243
aVgripping a single wooden match
p244
aVbetween the needles of his teeth?
p245
aVWho could not see him rounding a corner,
p246
aVthe blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,
p247
aVthe sudden flare
p248
aVand the creature, for one bright, shining moment,
p249
aVsuddenly thrust ahead of his time \u2014
p250
aVnow a fire-starter,
p251
aVnow a torch-bearer
p252
aVin a forgotten ritual,
p253
aVlittle brown druid
p254
aVilluminating some ancient night?
p255
aVAnd who could fail to notice,
p256
aVlit up in the blazing insulation,
p257
aVthe tiny looks of wonderment
p258
aVon the faces of his fellow mice \u2014
p259
aVone-time inhabitants
p260
aVof what once was your house in the country?
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VBC: Thank you.
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aVThank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."
p267
aVI wrote this after a friend's funeral,
p268
aVbut not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,
p269
aVas all eulogists tend to do,
p270
aVwhich is how happy the deceased would be
p271
aVto look down and see all of us assembled.
p272
aVAnd that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,
p273
aVhaving to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.
p274
aVSo the little poem is called "The Dead."
p275
aa(lp276
V(Video) Narration: "The Dead."
p277
aVThe dead are always looking down on us,
p278
aVthey say.
p279
aVWhile we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,
p280
aVthey are looking down
p281
aVthrough the glass-bottom boats of heaven
p282
aVas they row themselves slowly
p283
aVthrough eternity.
p284
aVThey watch the tops of our heads
p285
aVmoving below on Earth.
p286
aVAnd when we lie down
p287
aVin a field or on a couch,
p288
aVdrugged perhaps
p289
aVby the hum of a warm afternoon,
p290
aVthey think we are looking back at them,
p291
aVwhich makes them lift their oars
p292
aVand fall silent
p293
aVand wait like parents
p294
aVfor us to close our eyes.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VBC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.
p299
aVIt took a long time \u2014
p300
aVI mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage \u2014
p301
aVa long time to put those two together.
p302
aVBut then again, it took us a long time
p303
aVto put the wheel and the suitcase together.
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVI mean, we had the wheel for some time.
p306
aVAnd schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VI just have time
p311
aVto read a more recent poem to you.
p312
aVIf it has a subject,
p313
aVthe subject is adolescence.
p314
aVAnd it's addressed to a certain person.
p315
aVIt's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."
p316
aa(lp317
V"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon
p318
aVon the day you were born,
p319
aVyou would be all done in only one more year?
p320
aVOf course, you couldn't have done that all alone.
p321
aVSo never mind;
p322
aVyou're fine just being yourself.
p323
aVYou're loved for just being you.
p324
aVBut did you know that at your age
p325
aVJudy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,
p326
aVJoan of Arc was leading the French army to victory
p327
aVand Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room \u2014
p328
aVno wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?
p329
aVOf course, there will be time for all that
p330
aVlater in your life,
p331
aVafter you come out of your room
p332
aVand begin to blossom,
p333
aVor at least pick up all your socks.
p334
aVFor some reason I keep remembering
p335
aVthat Lady Jane Grey was queen of England
p336
aVwhen she was only 15.
p337
aVBut then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVA few centuries later,
p340
aVwhen he was your age,
p341
aVFranz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,
p342
aVbut that did not keep him
p343
aVfrom composing two symphonies, four operas
p344
aVand two complete masses as a youngster.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aVBut of course, that was in Austria
p347
aVat the height of Romantic lyricism,
p348
aVnot here in the suburbs of Cleveland.
p349
aV(Laughter)
p350
aVFrankly, who cares
p351
aVif Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15
p352
aVor if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?
p353
aVWe think you're special just being you \u2014
p354
aVplaying with your food and staring into space.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVBy the way,
p357
aVI lied about Schubert doing the dishes,
p358
aVbut that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
V(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
