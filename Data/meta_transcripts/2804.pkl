VMichael Browning: engineer,
p4
aVinnovator \u2014
p5
aVinventor, really \u2014
p6
aVand inspiring father.
p7
aVHe had a passion for flight, as you can kind of sense
p8
aVfrom that rather dubious 1970s office-leaving present.
p9
aVAnd some 40 years after that was created,
p10
aVa small group of us got together
p11
aVto have a go,
p12
aVa run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired people for years,
p13
aVand do it in a very different kind of way.
p14
aVAnd that's the journey I'd like to share with you now.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe starting hypothesis was one of the human mind and body,
p17
aVwhich, as you've seen for the last few days here,
p18
aVis an amazing construct.
p19
aVWhat if you augmented that wonderful machine
p20
aVwith just the right technology?
p21
aVIf you approach flight in that kind of real way,
p22
aVwhere could you get to?
p23
aa(lp24
VSo my training partner here back in London, Denton,
p25
aVis doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than me.
p26
aVGuess what? It's London.
p27
aVThe idea was that you augment that.
p28
aVAnd so, how do you augment that?
p29
aVWell, we bought one of these.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is a micro gas turbine.
p32
aVThis was ground zero,
p33
aVso that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive,
p34
aVso we got two in a field.
p35
aVThe real hero here, by the way, is, right in the background,
p36
aVthere's a lady tending some vegetables,
p37
aVwho does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while \u2014
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VI think the only thing less happy is the grass,
p42
aVthat we did probably damage quite badly.
p43
aa(lp44
VYou get an idea of the thrust here,
p45
aVwhen I try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail.
p46
aVThat's around 50 kilos of thrust there.
p47
aVWe were quite impressed with that.
p48
aVWe thought we were getting somewhere.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo there's only one sensible way to go from there:
p51
aVyou get four.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VI have to say, I still like watching these back.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo then we thought well, let's try and spread the load a bit.
p58
aVThe legs are designed to take the load,
p59
aVso why don't we spread it out a bit?
p60
aVThat bit was good.
p61
aVThe harness \u2014
p62
aVa nice idea but it didn't really work,
p63
aVas you'll see now.
p64
aVThis whole journey was very much about trying things \u2014
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VYeah, it really didn't work, did it?
p69
aa(lp70
VTrying things and learning by failing at them most of the time.
p71
aVAnd that included failing by falling over.
p72
aVIf you notice, we've got five engines here \u2014
p73
aVnot to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance,
p74
aVstill had a go.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd then I pinched a fuel line.
p79
aVSo again, good learning. We learned not to do that again.
p80
aa(lp81
VThis was a blind alley.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VThis was three on each arm \u2014
p86
aVthat was ridiculous.
p87
aVThat was 70 kilos on each arm.
p88
aVAgain, struck that one off.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VBut we were starting to make some really quite convincing progress,
p93
aVjust enough to make you believe that maybe \u2014
p94
aVmaybe we could get there.
p95
aVYou can see, look \u2014 tantalizing.
p96
aVThe model of one on each leg and two on each arm,
p97
aVon paper, that was enough thrust.
p98
aVAnd then we did what I'm about to show you now,
p99
aVand I still love watching this one.
p100
aVThis was our first six-second, reasonably coherent flight.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VThat was the point where this endeavor went from:
p105
aV"I'm really not sure this is going to work,"
p106
aVto: "Oh my god, it does work!"
p107
aVFrom there on we then refined it,
p108
aVbut we carried on falling over a lot.
p109
aVFalling over, like I say, is definitely the best way to learn.
p110
aVAfter a while, we starting really refining the layout of all of this.
p111
aVAnd you'll see, that's stability and control \u2014
p112
aVthere's no wires there or anything \u2014
p113
aVthat's a combination of us refining the technology,
p114
aVincluding with a Tupperware box on the back for the electronics
p115
aVand actually learning the balance and control.
p116
aa(lp117
VI'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece
p118
aVand talk over it.
p119
aVAfter a while, the jet engine noise is a bit annoying.
p120
aVThis is only a few weeks ago.
p121
aVYou can see the stability and control is really quite nice,
p122
aVand I'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis,
p123
aVthat the human mind and body, if properly augmented in that way,
p124
aVcan achieve some pretty cool stuff.
p125
aVI mean, like I said:
p126
aVI'm not thinking about where I'm moving my arms at that stage.
p127
aVI'm looking at the objective of where I want to get to,
p128
aVand a bit like riding a bike,
p129
aVmy arms are just doing their thing.
p130
aVIt's a very strange experience.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo where is all this headed?
p133
aa(lp134
VI'll talk over this landing \u2014
p135
aVI think I land in this one.
p136
aa(lp137
VWell, I don't think anybody's going to go down to Walmart
p138
aVor take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while,
p139
aVbut the team at Gravity are building some awesome technology
p140
aVthat's going to make this look like child's play.
p141
aVWe're working on some things
p142
aVthat will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight
p143
aVto a wider audience, beyond the events and displays we're doing.
p144
aVWe're even starting to look for pilots two and three,
p145
aVif there's any volunteers.
p146
aa(lp147
VI've got this vision.
p148
aVIt sounds audacious, but let's just stick it out there,
p149
aVthat one day maybe we can rise up above a beach,
p150
aVfly up and down the coastline of it, rise up a bit higher,
p151
aVwith some of the safety kit we're working on to make this achievable.
p152
aVThen over the horizon comes a Hercules with the ramp down.
p153
aVAs it comes past, you start picking up speed
p154
aVand see if we can intercept \u2014
p155
aVfrom the rear, not the front, that would be a mistake \u2014
p156
aVand then try and land in the back.
p157
aVAnd as I say, that's a little way off at the moment.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut this is also, if I take a big step back from this,
p160
aVthis is also a very personal journey for me.
p161
aVBack to that lovely photo,
p162
aVor photo in a picture.
p163
aVSadly, my father took his own life when I was 15,
p164
aVand left an awful lot of unfulfilled ambition.
p165
aVHe was a wonderful inventor,
p166
aVa maverick creator.
p167
aVAnd I'd just like to think, if it was possible,
p168
aVif he was looking down,
p169
aVhe would be \u2014
p170
aVhe'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we've done here,
p171
aVI think.
p172
aVSo, it's a tribute to him.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you very much.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
V(Voice-over) Richard Browning: I'm probably more nervous
p179
aVabout doing the demo after this.
p180
aVI've got a lot of things to get done today.
p181
aVWorst-case scenario, we don't get a clean start.
p182
aa(lp183
VOr we get an unplanned failure while I'm actually flying around.
p184
aVThis is why we keep it very low,
p185
aVso the worst is I just look like an idiot and fall on my rear, as I said.
p186
aVSo you can all enjoy that if that happens.
