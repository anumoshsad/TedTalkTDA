VSo, I have a feature on my website where every week
p4
aVpeople submit hypothetical questions
p5
aVfor me to answer,
p6
aVand I try to answer them using math, science
p7
aVand comics.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo for example, one person asked,
p10
aVwhat would happen if you tried to hit a baseball
p11
aVpitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?
p12
aVSo I did some calculations.
p13
aVNow, normally, when an object flies through the air,
p14
aVthe air will flow around the object,
p15
aVbut in this case, the ball would be going so fast
p16
aVthat the air molecules wouldn't have time
p17
aVto move out of the way.
p18
aVThe ball would smash right into and through them,
p19
aVand the collisions with these air molecules
p20
aVwould knock away the nitrogen,
p21
aVcarbon and hydrogen from the ball,
p22
aVfragmenting it off into tiny particles,
p23
aVand also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion
p24
aVin the air around it.
p25
aVThis would result in a flood of x-rays
p26
aVthat would spread out in a bubble
p27
aValong with exotic particles,
p28
aVplasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,
p29
aVand that would move away from the pitcher's mound
p30
aVslightly faster than the ball.
p31
aVNow at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,
p32
aVthe home plate is far enough away
p33
aVthat light hasn't had time to reach it,
p34
aVwhich means the batter
p35
aVstill sees the pitcher about to throw
p36
aVand has no idea that anything is wrong.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVNow, after 70 nanoseconds,
p39
aVthe ball will reach home plate,
p40
aVor at least the cloud of expanding plasma
p41
aVthat used to be the ball,
p42
aVand it will engulf the bat and the batter
p43
aVand the plate and the catcher and the umpire
p44
aVand start disintegrating them all
p45
aVas it also starts to carry them backward
p46
aVthrough the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate.
p47
aVSo if you were watching this whole thing
p48
aVfrom a hill,
p49
aVideally, far away,
p50
aVwhat you'd see is a bright flash of light
p51
aVthat would fade over a few seconds,
p52
aVfollowed by a blast wave spreading out,
p53
aVshredding trees and houses
p54
aVas it moves away from the stadium,
p55
aVand then eventually a mushroom cloud
p56
aVrising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VSo the Major League Baseball rules
p59
aVare a little bit hazy,
p60
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 under rule 6.02 and 5.09,
p61
aVI think that in this situation,
p62
aVthe batter would be considered hit by pitch
p63
aVand would be eligible to take first base,
p64
aVif it still existed.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is the kind of question I answer,
p67
aVand I get people writing in with
p68
aVa lot of other strange questions.
p69
aVI've had someone write and say,
p70
aVscientifically speaking, what is the best
p71
aVand fastest way to hide a body?
p72
aVCan you do this one soon?
p73
aVAnd I had someone write in,
p74
aVI've had people write in about,
p75
aVcan you prove whether or not you can find love again
p76
aVafter your heart's broken?
p77
aVAnd I've had people send in
p78
aVwhat are clearly homework questions
p79
aVthey're trying to get me to do for them.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut one week, a couple months ago,
p82
aVI got a question that was actually about Google.
p83
aVIf all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards,
p84
aVhow big would Google's data warehouse be?
p85
aVNow, Google's pretty secretive about their operations,
p86
aVso no one really knows how much data Google has,
p87
aVand in fact, no one really knows how many data centers Google has,
p88
aVexcept people at Google itself.
p89
aVAnd I've tried, I've met them a few times,
p90
aVtried asking them, and they aren't revealing anything.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I decided to try to figure this out myself.
p93
aVThere are a few things that I looked at here.
p94
aVI started with money.
p95
aVGoogle has to reveal how much they spend,
p96
aVin general, and that lets you put some caps
p97
aVon how many data centers could they be building,
p98
aVbecause a big data center costs a certain amount of money.
p99
aVAnd you can also then put a cap on
p100
aVhow much of the world hard drive market are they taking up,
p101
aVwhich turns out, it's pretty sizable.
p102
aVI read a calculation at one point,
p103
aVI think Google has a drive failure
p104
aVabout every minute or two,
p105
aVand they just throw out the hard drive
p106
aVand swap in a new one.
p107
aVSo they go through a huge number of them.
p108
aVAnd so by looking at money,
p109
aVyou can get an idea of how many of these centers they have.
p110
aVYou can also look at power.
p111
aVYou can look at how much electricity they need,
p112
aVbecause you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers,
p113
aVand Google is more efficient than most,
p114
aVbut they still have some basic requirements,
p115
aVand that lets you put a limit
p116
aVon the number of servers that they have.
p117
aVYou can also look at square footage and see
p118
aVof the data centers that you know,
p119
aVhow big are they?
p120
aVHow much room is that?
p121
aVHow many server racks could you fit in there?
p122
aVAnd for some data centers,
p123
aVyou might get two of these pieces of information.
p124
aVYou know how much they spent,
p125
aVand they also, say, because they had to contract
p126
aVwith the local government
p127
aVto get the power provided,
p128
aVyou might know what they made a deal to buy,
p129
aVso you know how much power it takes.
p130
aVThen you can look at the ratios of those numbers,
p131
aVand figure out for a data center
p132
aVwhere you don't have that information,
p133
aVyou can figure out,
p134
aVbut maybe you only have one of those,
p135
aVyou know the square footage, then you could figure out
p136
aVwell, maybe the power is proportional.
p137
aVAnd you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities,
p138
aVyou know, with guesses about the total amount of storage,
p139
aVthe number of servers, the number of drives per server,
p140
aVand in each case using what you know
p141
aVto come up with a model that narrows down
p142
aVyour guesses for the things that you don't know.
p143
aVIt's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get.
p144
aVAnd this is a lot of fun.
p145
aVThe math is not all that advanced,
p146
aVand really it's like nothing more than
p147
aVsolving a sudoku puzzle.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo what I did, I went through all of this information,
p150
aVspent a day or two researching.
p151
aVAnd there are some things I didn't look at.
p152
aVYou could always look at the Google
p153
aVrecruitment messages that they post.
p154
aVThat gives you an idea of where they have people.
p155
aVSometimes, when people visit a data center,
p156
aVthey'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,
p157
aVand they aren't supposed to,
p158
aVbut you can learn things about their hardware that way.
p159
aVAnd in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers.
p160
aVTurns out, they know where all the Google data centers are,
p161
aVat least the ones that have people in them.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut I came up with my estimate,
p164
aVwhich I felt pretty good about,
p165
aVthat was about 10 exabytes of data
p166
aVacross all of Google's operations,
p167
aVand then another maybe five exabytes or so
p168
aVof offline storage in tape drives,
p169
aVwhich it turns out Google is
p170
aVabout the world's largest consumer of.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo I came up with this estimate, and this is
p173
aVa staggering amount of data.
p174
aVIt's quite a bit more than any other organization
p175
aVin the world has, as far as we know.
p176
aVThere's a couple of other contenders,
p177
aVespecially everyone always thinks of the NSA.
p178
aVBut using some of these same methods,
p179
aVwe can look at the NSA's data centers,
p180
aVand figure out, you know, we don't know what's going on there,
p181
aVbut it's pretty clear that their operation
p182
aVis not the size of Google's.
p183
aa(lp184
VAdding all of this up, I came up with
p185
aVthe other thing that we can answer, which is,
p186
aVhow many punch cards would this take?
p187
aVAnd so a punch card can hold
p188
aVabout 80 characters,
p189
aVand you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,
p190
aVand you put them in, say,
p191
aVmy home region of New England,
p192
aVit would cover the entire region
p193
aVup to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,
p194
aVwhich is about three times deeper
p195
aVthan the glaciers during the last ice age
p196
aVabout 20,000 years ago.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo this is impractical, but I think
p199
aVthat's about the best answer I could come up with.
p200
aVAnd I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.
p201
aVAnd I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,
p202
aVbecause of course they've been so secretive,
p203
aVthey didn't answer of my questions,
p204
aVand so I just put it up and said,
p205
aVwell, I guess we'll never know.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut then a little while later
p208
aVI got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,
p209
aVsaying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.
p210
aVSo I go and get it, open it up,
p211
aVand it's punch cards. (Laughter)
p212
aVGoogle-branded punch cards.
p213
aVAnd on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes,
p214
aVand I said, thank you, thank you,
p215
aVokay, so what's on here?
p216
aVSo I get some software and start reading it,
p217
aVand scan them, and it turns out
p218
aVit's a puzzle.
p219
aVThere's a bunch of code,
p220
aVand I get some friends to help,
p221
aVand we crack the code, and then inside that is another code,
p222
aVand then there are some equations,
p223
aVand then we solve those equations,
p224
aVand then finally out pops a message from Google
p225
aVwhich is their official answer to my article,
p226
aVand it said, "No comment."
p227
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd I love calculating these kinds of things,
p230
aVand it's not that I love doing the math.
p231
aVI do a lot of math,
p232
aVbut I don't really like math for its own sake.
p233
aVWhat I love is that it lets you take
p234
aVsome things that you know,
p235
aVand just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper,
p236
aVfind out something that you didn't know
p237
aVthat's very surprising.
p238
aVAnd I have a lot of stupid questions,
p239
aVand I love that math gives the power
p240
aVto answer them sometimes.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd sometimes not.
p243
aVThis is a question I got from a reader,
p244
aVan anonymous reader,
p245
aVand the subject line just said, "Urgent,"
p246
aVand this was the entire email:
p247
aV"If people had wheels and could fly,
p248
aVhow would we differentiate them from airplanes?"
p249
aVUrgent. (Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd I think there are some questions
p252
aVthat math just cannot answer.
p253
aVThank you.
