VI am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists.
p4
aVI can't see this planet with my naked eyes
p5
aVor even with the most powerful telescopes
p6
aVwe currently possess.
p7
aVBut I know that it's there.
p8
aVAnd understanding contradictions that occur in nature
p9
aVwill help us find it.
p10
aa(lp11
VOn our planet,
p12
aVwhere there's water, there's life.
p13
aVSo we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance
p14
aVfrom their stars.
p15
aVAt this distance,
p16
aVshown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures,
p17
aVplanets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces
p18
aVas lakes and oceans
p19
aVwhere life might reside.
p20
aVSome astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets
p21
aVat these distances from their stars.
p22
aVWhat I do picks up where their job ends.
p23
aVI model the possible climates of exoplanets.
p24
aVAnd here's why that's important:
p25
aVthere are many factors besides distance from its star
p26
aVthat control whether a planet can support life.
p27
aa(lp28
VTake the planet Venus.
p29
aVIt's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty,
p30
aVbecause of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky.
p31
aVBut spacecraft measurements revealed a different story.
p32
aVThe surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
p33
aV500 Celsius.
p34
aVThat's hot enough to melt lead.
p35
aVIts thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason.
p36
aVIt causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,
p37
aVtrapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface.
p38
aVThe reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet.
p39
aVFrom these lessons from our own solar system,
p40
aVwe've learned that a planet's atmosphere
p41
aVis crucial to its climate and potential to host life.
p42
aa(lp43
VWe don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like
p44
aVbecause the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars
p45
aVand so far away from us.
p46
aVFor example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water \u2014
p47
aVit's called Gliese 667 Cc \u2014
p48
aVsuch a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name \u2014
p49
aVit's 23 light years away.
p50
aVSo that's more than 100 trillion miles.
p51
aVTrying to measure the atmospheric composition
p52
aVof an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard.
p53
aVIt's like trying to see a fruit fly
p54
aVpassing in front of a car's headlight.
p55
aVOK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away,
p56
aVand you want to know the precise color of that fly.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I use computer models
p59
aVto calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need
p60
aVto have a suitable climate for water and life.
p61
aa(lp62
VHere's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f,
p63
aVwith the Earth for reference.
p64
aVIt's 1,200 light years away,
p65
aVand just 40 percent larger than Earth.
p66
aVOur NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water
p67
aVfrom many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit.
p68
aVSo I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet
p69
aVto look for signs of life.
p70
aa(lp71
VIce on a planet's surface is also important for climate.
p72
aVIce absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light,
p73
aVand reflects shorter, bluer light.
p74
aVThat's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue.
p75
aVThe redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice.
p76
aVOnly the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom.
p77
aVThen it gets reflected back to up to our eyes
p78
aVand we see blue ice.
p79
aVMy models show that planets orbiting cooler stars
p80
aVcould actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars.
p81
aVThere's another contradiction \u2014
p82
aVthat ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars,
p83
aVand that light, that energy, heats the ice.
p84
aa(lp85
VUsing climate models to explore
p86
aVhow these contradictions can affect planetary climate
p87
aVis vital to the search for life elsewhere.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd it's no surprise that this is my specialty.
p90
aVI'm an African-American female astronomer
p91
aVand a classically trained actor
p92
aVwho loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines,
p93
aVso I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature \u2014
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
V... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists.
p100
aa(lp101
VMy organization, Rising Stargirls,
p102
aVteaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color,
p103
aVusing theater, writing and visual art.
p104
aVThat's another contradiction \u2014 science and art don't often go together,
p105
aVbut interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves
p106
aVto what they learn,
p107
aVand maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers
p108
aVwho are full of contradictions,
p109
aVand use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all,
p110
aVthat we are truly not alone in the universe.
p111
