VI have a confession to make.
p4
aVI am addicted to adventure,
p5
aVand as a young boy,
p6
aVI would rather look outside the window
p7
aVat the birds in the trees and the sky
p8
aVthan looking at that two-dimensional
p9
aVchalky blackboard where time stands still
p10
aVand even sometimes dies.
p11
aVMy teachers thought there was something wrong
p12
aVwith me because I wasn't paying attention in class.
p13
aVThey didn't find anything  specifically wrong with me,
p14
aVother than being slightly  dyslexic because I'm a lefty.
p15
aVBut they didn't test for curiosity.
p16
aVCuriosity, to me,
p17
aVis about our connection
p18
aVwith the world, with the universe.
p19
aVIt's about seeing what's  around that next coral head
p20
aVor what's around that next tree,
p21
aVand learning more not only about our environment
p22
aVbut about ourselves.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, my dream of dreams,
p25
aVI want to go explore the oceans of Mars,
p26
aVbut until we can go there,
p27
aVI think the oceans still hold
p28
aVquite a few secrets.
p29
aVAs a matter of fact,
p30
aVif you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is
p31
aVand dissect it into a living space,
p32
aVthe ocean represents over 3.4 billion
p33
aVcubic kilometers of volume, within which
p34
aVwe've explored less than five percent.
p35
aVAnd I look at this, and I go, well,
p36
aVthere are tools to go  deeper, longer and further:
p37
aVsubmarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.
p38
aVBut if we're going to explore the final frontier
p39
aVon this planet, we need to live there.
p40
aVWe need to build a log cabin, if you will,
p41
aVat the bottom of the sea.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd so there was a great curiosity in my soul
p44
aVwhen I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]
p45
aVby the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.
p46
aVMaybe you've heard of her.
p47
aVTwo years ago, she was staked out
p48
aVat the last undersea marine laboratory
p49
aVto try and save it,
p50
aVto try and petition
p51
aVfor us not to scrap it
p52
aVand bring it back on land.
p53
aVWe've only had about a dozen or so
p54
aVscientific labs at the bottom of the sea.
p55
aVThere's only one left in the world:
p56
aVit's nine miles offshore
p57
aVand 65 feet down.
p58
aVIt's called Aquarius.
p59
aVAquarius, in some fashion,
p60
aVis a dinosaur,
p61
aVan ancient robot chained to the bottom,
p62
aVthis Leviathan.
p63
aVIn other ways, it's a legacy.
p64
aVAnd so with that visit, I realized  that my time is short
p65
aVif I wanted to experience
p66
aVwhat it was like to become an aquanaut.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen we swam towards this after many
p69
aVmoons of torture and two years of preparation,
p70
aVthis habitat waiting to invite us
p71
aVwas like a new home.
p72
aVAnd the point of going down to
p73
aVand living at this habitat was not to stay inside.
p74
aVIt wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus.
p75
aVIt was about giving us the luxury of time
p76
aVoutside to wander, to explore,
p77
aVto understand more about this oceanic final frontier.
p78
aa(lp79
VWe had megafauna come and visit us.
p80
aVThis spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans.
p81
aVBut why this is so important,
p82
aVwhy this picture is up,
p83
aVis because this particular animal brought his friends around,
p84
aVand instead of being the pelagic animals that they were,
p85
aVthey started getting curious about us,
p86
aVthese new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood,
p87
aVdoing things with plankton.
p88
aVWe were studying all sorts of animals and critters,
p89
aVand they got closer and closer to us,
p90
aVand because of the luxury of time,
p91
aVthese animals, these residents of the coral reef,
p92
aVwere starting to get used to us,
p93
aVand these pelagics that normal travel through stopped.
p94
aVThis particular animal actually circled
p95
aVfor 31 full days during our mission.
p96
aVSo mission 31 wasn't so much
p97
aVabout breaking records.
p98
aVIt was about that human-ocean connection.
p99
aa(lp100
VBecause of the luxury of time, we were able
p101
aVto study animals such as sharks and grouper
p102
aVin aggregations that we've never seen before.
p103
aVIt's like seeing dogs and  cats behaving well together.
p104
aVEven being able to commune with animals
p105
aVthat are much larger than us,
p106
aVsuch as this endangered goliath grouper
p107
aVwho only still resides in the Florida Keys.
p108
aVOf course, just like any neighbor,
p109
aVafter a while, if they get tired,
p110
aVthe goliath grouper barks at us,
p111
aVand this bark is so powerful
p112
aVthat it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all
p113
aVwithin a split second.
p114
aVFor us, it's just telling us to go back
p115
aVinto the habitat and leave them alone.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, this wasn't just about adventure.
p118
aVThere was actually a serious note to it.
p119
aVWe did a lot of science, and again, because of the luxury of time,
p120
aVwe were able to do over three years of science
p121
aVin 31 days.
p122
aVIn this particular case, we were using a PAM,
p123
aVor, let me just see if I can get this straight,
p124
aVa Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.
p125
aVAnd our scientists from FIU, MIT,
p126
aVand from Northeastern
p127
aVwere able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do
p128
aVwhen we're not around.
p129
aVThe Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer, or PAM,
p130
aVgauges the fluorescence of corals
p131
aVas it pertains to pollutants in the water
p132
aVas well as climate change-related issues.
p133
aVWe used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,
p134
aVsuch as this sonde, or what I like to call
p135
aVthe sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde
p136
aVitself tests for metabolism rates
p137
aVin what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,
p138
aVor the redwoods of the [ocean].
p139
aVAnd this gives us a much better gauge
p140
aVof what's happening underwater
p141
aVwith regard to climate change-related issues,
p142
aVand how the dynamics of that
p143
aVaffect us here on land.
p144
aVAnd finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.
p145
aVAnd predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,
p146
aVbecause as we take away some of the predators
p147
aVon these coral reefs around the world,
p148
aVthe prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.
p149
aVWhat we realized is
p150
aVnot only do they stop taking care of the reef,
p151
aVdarting in, grabbing a little bit of algae
p152
aVand going back into their homes,
p153
aVthey start spreading out and disappearing
p154
aVfrom those particular coral reefs.
p155
aVWell, within that 31 days,
p156
aVwe were able to generate over 10 scientific papers
p157
aVon each one of these topics.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut the point of adventure is not only to learn,
p160
aVit's to be able to share that  knowledge with the world,
p161
aVand with that, thanks to a  couple of engineers at MIT,
p162
aVwe were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic
p163
aVto capture slow-motion video,
p164
aVup to 20,000 frames per second
p165
aVin a little box
p166
aVthat's worth 3,000 dollars.
p167
aVIt's available to every one of us.
p168
aVAnd that particular camera gives us an insight
p169
aVinto what fairly common animals do
p170
aVbut we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.
p171
aVLet me show you a quick video
p172
aVof what this camera does.
p173
aVYou can see the silky bubble come out
p174
aVof our hard hats.
p175
aVIt gives us an insight
p176
aVinto some of the animals that we were sitting
p177
aVright next to for 31 days
p178
aVand never normally would have paid attention to,
p179
aVsuch as hermit crabs.
p180
aVNow, using a cutting-edge piece of technology
p181
aVthat's not really meant for the oceans
p182
aVis not always easy.
p183
aVWe sometimes had to put the camera upside down,
p184
aVcordon it back to the lab,
p185
aVand actually man the trigger
p186
aVfrom the lab itself.
p187
aVBut what this gives us
p188
aVis the foresight to look at and analyze
p189
aVin scientific and engineering terms
p190
aVsome of the most amazing behavior
p191
aVthat the human eye just can't pick up,
p192
aVsuch as this manta shrimp
p193
aVtrying to catch its prey,
p194
aVwithin about .3 seconds.
p195
aVThat punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,
p196
aVand if you ever try to catch a bullet
p197
aVin mid-flight with your eye, impossible.
p198
aVBut now we can see things
p199
aVsuch as these Christmas tree worms
p200
aVpulling in and fanning out
p201
aVin a way that the eye just can't capture,
p202
aVor in this case,
p203
aVa fish throwing up grains of sand.
p204
aVThis is an actual sailfin goby,
p205
aVand if you look at it in real time,
p206
aVit actually doesn't even show its fanning motion
p207
aVbecause it's so quick.
p208
aa(lp209
VOne of the most precious gifts that we had underwater
p210
aVis that we had WiFi,
p211
aVand for 31 days straight we were able to connect
p212
aVwith the world in real time  from the bottom of the sea
p213
aVand share all of these experiences.
p214
aVQuite literally right there
p215
aVI am Skyping in the classroom
p216
aVwith one of the six continents
p217
aVand some of the 70,000  students that we connected
p218
aVevery single day to some of these experiences.
p219
aVAs a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took
p220
aVwith my smartphone from underwater
p221
aVof a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.
p222
aVWe had never seen that before.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd I dream of the day
p225
aVthat we have underwater cities,
p226
aVand maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries
p227
aVof adventure and knowledge,
p228
aVand we share that knowledge with others out there,
p229
aVwe can solve all sorts of problems.
p230
aVMy grandfather used to say,
p231
aV"People protect what they love."
p232
aVMy father, "How can people protect
p233
aVwhat they don't understand?"
p234
aVAnd I've thought about this my whole life.
p235
aVNothing is impossible.
p236
aVWe need to dream, we need to be creative,
p237
aVand we all need to have an adventure
p238
aVin order to create miracles in the darkest of times.
p239
aVAnd whether it's about climate change
p240
aVor eradicating poverty
p241
aVor giving back to future generations
p242
aVwhat we've taken for granted,
p243
aVit's about adventure.
p244
aVAnd who knows, maybe there will be underwater cities,
p245
aVand maybe some of you
p246
aVwill become the future aquanauts.
p247
