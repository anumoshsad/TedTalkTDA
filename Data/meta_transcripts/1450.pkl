VThis is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.
p4
aVIt's a diagram of the visual system.
p5
aVAnd some things look very familiar today.
p6
aVTwo eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
p7
aVThere's a very large nose
p8
aVthat doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd if we compare this
p11
aVto more recent representations of the visual system,
p12
aVyou'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated
p13
aVover the intervening thousand years.
p14
aVAnd that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,
p15
aVrather than just looking at its overall shape.
p16
aa(lp17
VImagine you wanted to understand how a computer works
p18
aVand all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
p19
aVYou really would be kind of out of luck.
p20
aVYou want to be able to open it up, crack it open,
p21
aVlook at the wiring inside.
p22
aVAnd up until a little more than a century ago,
p23
aVnobody was able to do that with the brain.
p24
aVNobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd that's because if you take a brain out of the skull
p27
aVand you cut a thin slice of it,
p28
aVput it under even a very powerful microscope,
p29
aVthere's nothing there.
p30
aVIt's gray, formless.
p31
aVThere's no structure. It won't tell you anything.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd this all changed in the late 19th century.
p34
aVSuddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed
p35
aVand they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
p36
aVThe computer was cracked open.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo what really launched modern neuroscience
p39
aVwas a stain called the Golgi stain.
p40
aVAnd it works in a very particular way.
p41
aVInstead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,
p42
aVit somehow only stains about one percent of them.
p43
aVIt clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
p44
aVIf everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
p45
aVSo somehow it shows what's there.
p46
aa(lp47
VSpanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
p48
aVwho's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,
p49
aVapplied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,
p50
aVand really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
p51
aVAnd if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,
p52
aVthis is the transistor.
p53
aVAnd very quickly Cajal realized
p54
aVthat neurons don't operate alone,
p55
aVbut rather make connections with others
p56
aVthat form circuits just like in a computer.
p57
aVToday, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,
p58
aVthey light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
p59
aVAnd there's several ways of doing this.
p60
aVBut one of the most popular ones
p61
aVinvolves green fluorescent protein.
p62
aVNow green fluorescent protein,
p63
aVwhich oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,
p64
aVis very useful.
p65
aVBecause if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein
p66
aVand deliver it to a cell,
p67
aVthat cell will glow green \u2014
p68
aVor any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,
p69
aVyou get a cell to glow many different colors.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd so coming back to the brain,
p72
aVthis is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
p73
aVAnd it's so called, of course,
p74
aVbecause all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow sometimes neuroscientists need to identify
p77
aVindividual molecular components of neurons, molecules,
p78
aVrather than the entire cell.
p79
aVAnd there's several ways of doing this,
p80
aVbut one of the most popular ones
p81
aVinvolves using antibodies.
p82
aVAnd you're familiar, of course,
p83
aVwith antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
p84
aVBut it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system
p85
aVbecause they can recognize specific molecules,
p86
aVlike, for example, the coat protein
p87
aVof a virus that's invading the body.
p88
aVAnd researchers have used this fact
p89
aVin order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,
p90
aVrecognize specific substructures of the cell
p91
aVand identify them individually.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,
p94
aVbut they're also very powerful.
p95
aVThey have great explanatory power.
p96
aVThis, for example, is an antibody staining
p97
aVagainst serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd you've heard of serotonin, of course,
p100
aVin the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
p101
aVYou've heard of SSRIs,
p102
aVwhich are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
p103
aVAnd in order to understand how serotonin works,
p104
aVit's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
p105
aVAnd antibody stainings like this one
p106
aVcan be used to understand that sort of question.
p107
aa(lp108
VI'd like to leave you with the following thought:
p109
aVGreen fluorescent protein and antibodies
p110
aVare both totally natural products at the get-go.
p111
aVThey were evolved by nature
p112
aVin order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,
p113
aVor in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
p114
aVAnd only much later did scientists come onto the scene
p115
aVand say, "Hey, these are tools,
p116
aVthese are functions that we could use
p117
aVin our own research tool palette."
p118
aVAnd instead of applying feeble human minds
p119
aVto designing these tools from scratch,
p120
aVthere were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature
p121
aVdeveloped and refined steadily for millions of years
p122
aVby the greatest engineer of all.
p123
aVThank you.
