VYou know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.
p4
aVIn fact, I'm not very interested in parenting, per Se.
p5
aVIt's just that there's a certain style of parenting these days
p6
aVthat is kind of messing up kids,
p7
aVimpeding their chances to develop into theirselves.
p8
aVThere's a certain style of parenting these days
p9
aVthat's getting in the way.
p10
aa(lp11
VI guess what I'm saying is,
p12
aVwe spend a lot of time being very concerned
p13
aVabout parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids
p14
aVand their education or their upbringing,
p15
aVand rightly so.
p16
aVBut at the other end of the spectrum,
p17
aVthere's a lot of harm going on there as well,
p18
aVwhere parents feel a kid can't be successful
p19
aVunless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn
p20
aVand hovering over every happening, and micromanaging every moment,
p21
aVand steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhen we raise kids this way,
p24
aVand I'll say we,
p25
aVbecause Lord knows, in raising my two teenagers,
p26
aVI've had these tendencies myself,
p27
aVour kids end up leading a kind of checklisted childhood.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd here's what the checklisted childhood looks like.
p30
aVWe keep them safe and sound
p31
aVand fed and watered,
p32
aVand then we want to be sure they go to the right schools,
p33
aVthat they're in the right classes at the right schools,
p34
aVand that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools.
p35
aVBut not just the grades, the scores,
p36
aVand not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards
p37
aVand the sports, the activities, the leadership.
p38
aVWe tell our kids, don't just join a club,
p39
aVstart a club, because colleges want to see that.
p40
aVAnd check the box for community service.
p41
aVI mean, show the colleges you care about others.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection.
p46
aVWe expect our kids to perform at a level of perfection
p47
aVwe were never asked to perform at ourselves,
p48
aVand so because so much is required,
p49
aVwe think,
p50
aVwell then, of course we parents have to argue with every teacher
p51
aVand principal and coach and referee
p52
aVand act like our kid's concierge
p53
aVand personal handler
p54
aVand secretary.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd then with our kids, our precious kids,
p57
aVwe spend so much time nudging,
p58
aVcajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be,
p59
aVto be sure they're not screwing up,
p60
aVnot closing doors,
p61
aVnot ruining their future,
p62
aVsome hoped-for admission
p63
aVto a tiny handful of colleges
p64
aVthat deny almost every applicant.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd here's what it feels like to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.
p67
aVFirst of all, there's no time for free play.
p68
aVThere's no room in the afternoons,
p69
aVbecause everything has to be enriching, we think.
p70
aVIt's as if every piece of homework, every quiz, every activity
p71
aVis a make-or-break moment for this future we have in mind for them,
p72
aVand we absolve them of helping out around the house,
p73
aVand we even absolve them of getting enough sleep
p74
aVas long as they're checking off the items on their checklist.
p75
aVAnd in the checklisted childhood, we say we just want them to be happy,
p76
aVbut when they come home from school,
p77
aVwhat we ask about all too often first
p78
aVis their homework and their grades.
p79
aVAnd they see in our faces
p80
aVthat our approval, that our love,
p81
aVthat their very worth,
p82
aVcomes from A's.
p83
aVAnd then we walk alongside them
p84
aVand offer clucking praise like a trainer at the Westminster Dog Show \u2014
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
Vcoaxing them to just jump a little higher and soar a little farther,
p89
aVday after day after day.
p90
aVAnd when they get to high school,
p91
aVthey don't say, "Well, what might I be interested in studying
p92
aVor doing as an activity?"
p93
aVThey go to counselors and they say,
p94
aV"What do I need to do to get into the right college?"
p95
aVAnd then, when the grades start to roll in in high school,
p96
aVand they're getting some B's,
p97
aVor God forbid some C's,
p98
aVthey frantically text their friends
p99
aVand say, "Has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades?"
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd our kids,
p102
aVregardless of where they end up at the end of high school,
p103
aVthey're breathless.
p104
aVThey're brittle.
p105
aVThey're a little burned out.
p106
aVThey're a little old before their time,
p107
aVwishing the grown-ups in their lives had said, "What you've done is enough,
p108
aVthis effort you've put forth in childhood is enough."
p109
aVAnd they're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression
p110
aVand some of them are wondering,
p111
aVwill this life ever turn out to have been worth it?
p112
aa(lp113
VWell, we parents,
p114
aVwe parents are pretty sure it's all worth it.
p115
aVWe seem to behave \u2014
p116
aVit's like we literally think they will have no future
p117
aVif they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers
p118
aVwe have in mind for them.
p119
aa(lp120
VOr maybe, maybe, we're just afraid
p121
aVthey won't have a future we can brag about
p122
aVto our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars.
p123
aVYeah.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VBut if you look at what we've done,
p128
aVif you have the courage to really look at it,
p129
aVyou'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes
p130
aVfrom grades and scores,
p131
aVbut that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds
p132
aVall the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"
p133
aVwe send our children the message:
p134
aV"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me."
p135
aVAnd so with our overhelp,
p136
aVour overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding,
p137
aVwe deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy,
p138
aVwhich is a really fundamental tenet of the human psyche,
p139
aVfar more important than that self-esteem they get
p140
aVevery time we applaud.
p141
aVSelf-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions lead to outcomes,
p142
aVnot \u2014
p143
aVThere you go.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VNot one's parents' actions on one's behalf,
p148
aVbut when one's own actions lead to outcomes.
p149
aVSo simply put,
p150
aVif our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must,
p151
aVthen they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking, planning, deciding,
p152
aVdoing, hoping, coping, trial and error,
p153
aVdreaming and experiencing of life
p154
aVfor themselves.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, am I saying
p157
aVevery kid is hard-working and motivated
p158
aVand doesn't need a parent's involvement or interest in their lives,
p159
aVand we should just back off and let go?
p160
aVHell no.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VThat is not what I'm saying.
p165
aVWhat I'm saying is, when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards
p166
aVas the purpose of childhood,
p167
aVall in furtherance of some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges
p168
aVor entrance to a small number of careers,
p169
aVthat that's too narrow a definition of success for our kids.
p170
aVAnd even though we might help them achieve some short-term wins
p171
aVby overhelping \u2014
p172
aVlike they get a better grade if we help them do their homework,
p173
aVthey might end up with a longer childhood résumé when we help \u2014
p174
aVwhat I'm saying is that all of this comes at a long-term cost
p175
aVto their sense of self.
p176
aVWhat I'm saying is, we should be less concerned
p177
aVwith the specific set of colleges
p178
aVthey might be able to apply to or might get into
p179
aVand far more concerned that they have the habits, the mindset, the skill set,
p180
aVthe wellness, to be successful wherever they go.
p181
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p182
aVour kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores
p183
aVand a whole lot more interested
p184
aVin childhood providing a foundation for their success
p185
aVbuilt on things like love
p186
aVand chores.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VDid I just say chores? Did I just say chores? I really did.
p193
aVBut really, here's why.
p194
aVThe longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted
p195
aVis called the Harvard Grant Study.
p196
aVIt found that professional success in life,
p197
aVwhich is what we want for our kids,
p198
aVthat professional success in life comes from having done chores as a kid,
p199
aVand the earlier you started, the better,
p200
aVthat a roll-up-your-sleeves- and-pitch-in mindset,
p201
aVa mindset that says, there's some unpleasant work,
p202
aVsomeone's got to do it, it might as well be me,
p203
aVa mindset that says,
p204
aVI will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole,
p205
aVthat that's what gets you ahead in the workplace.
p206
aVNow, we all know this. You know this.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VWe all know this, and yet, in the checklisted childhood,
p211
aVwe absolve our kids of doing the work of chores around the house,
p212
aVand then they end up as young adults in the workplace
p213
aVstill waiting for a checklist,
p214
aVbut it doesn't exist,
p215
aVand more importantly, lacking the impulse, the instinct
p216
aVto roll up their sleeves and pitch in
p217
aVand look around and wonder, how can I be useful to my colleagues?
p218
aVHow can I anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need?
p219
aa(lp220
VA second very important finding from the Harvard Grant Study
p221
aVsaid that happiness in life
p222
aVcomes from love,
p223
aVnot love of work,
p224
aVlove of humans:
p225
aVour spouse, our partner, our friends, our family.
p226
aVSo childhood needs to teach our kids how to love,
p227
aVand they can't love others if they don't first love themselves,
p228
aVand they won't love themselves if we can't offer them unconditional love.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VRight.
p233
aVAnd so,
p234
aVinstead of being obsessed with grades and scores
p235
aVwhen our precious offspring come home from school,
p236
aVor we come home from work,
p237
aVwe need to close our technology, put away our phones,
p238
aVand look them in the eye
p239
aVand let them see the joy that fills our faces
p240
aVwhen we see our child for the first time in a few hours.
p241
aVAnd then we have to say,
p242
aV"How was your day?
p243
aVWhat did you like about today?"
p244
aVAnd when your teenage daughter says, "Lunch," like mine did,
p245
aVand I want to hear about the math test,
p246
aVnot lunch,
p247
aVyou have to still take an interest in lunch.
p248
aVYou gotta say, "What was great about lunch today?"
p249
aVThey need to know they matter to us as humans,
p250
aVnot because of their GPA.
p251
aa(lp252
VAll right, so you're thinking, chores and love,
p253
aVthat sounds all well and good, but give me a break.
p254
aVThe colleges want to see top scores and grades
p255
aVand accolades and awards, and I'm going to tell you, sort of.
p256
aVThe very biggest brand-name schools are asking that of our young adults,
p257
aVbut here's the good news.
p258
aVContrary to what the college rankings racket would have us believe \u2014
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
Vyou don't have to go to one of the biggest brand name schools
p263
aVto be happy and successful in life.
p264
aVHappy and successful people went to state school,
p265
aVwent to a small college no one has heard of,
p266
aVwent to community college,
p267
aVwent to a college over here and flunked out.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VThe evidence is in this room, is in our communities,
p272
aVthat this is the truth.
p273
aVAnd if we could widen our blinders
p274
aVand be willing to look at a few more colleges,
p275
aVmaybe remove our own egos from the equation,
p276
aVwe could accept and embrace this truth and then realize,
p277
aVit is hardly the end of the world
p278
aVif our kids don't go to one of those big brand-name schools.
p279
aVAnd more importantly,
p280
aVif their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist
p281
aVthen when they get to college,
p282
aVwhichever one it is,
p283
aVwell, they'll have gone there on their own volition,
p284
aVfueled by their own desire,
p285
aVcapable and ready to thrive there.
p286
aa(lp287
VI have to admit something to you.
p288
aVI've got two kids I mentioned, Sawyer and Avery.
p289
aVThey're teenagers.
p290
aVAnd once upon a time,
p291
aVI think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery
p292
aVlike little bonsai trees \u2014
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
Vthat I was going to carefully clip and prune
p297
aVand shape into some perfect form of a human
p298
aVthat might just be perfect enough to warrant them admission
p299
aVto one of the most highly selective colleges.
p300
aVBut I've come to realize, after working with thousands of other people's kids \u2014
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
Vand raising two kids of my own,
p305
aVmy kids aren't bonsai trees.
p306
aVThey're wildflowers
p307
aVof an unknown genus and species \u2014
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
Vand it's my job to provide a nourishing environment,
p312
aVto strengthen them through chores
p313
aVand to love them so they can love others and receive love
p314
aVand the college, the major, the career,
p315
aVthat's up to them.
p316
aVMy job is not to make them become what I would have them become,
p317
aVbut to support them in becoming their glorious selves.
p318
