VSo, I'm an artist.
p4
aVI live in New York, and I've been working in advertising
p5
aVfor \u2014 ever since I left school,
p6
aVso about seven, eight years now,
p7
aVand it was draining.
p8
aVI worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,
p9
aVand I found myself never having time for all the projects
p10
aVthat I wanted to work on on my own.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd one day I was at work and I saw a talk
p13
aVby Stefan Sagmeister on TED,
p14
aVand it was called "The power of time off,"
p15
aVand he spoke about how every seven years,
p16
aVhe takes a year off from work so he could
p17
aVdo his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,
p18
aVand I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.
p19
aVI need to take time to travel and spend time with my family
p20
aVand start my own creative ideas."
p21
aa(lp22
VSo the first of those projects ended up being
p23
aVsomething I called "One Second Every Day."
p24
aVBasically I'm recording one second of every day of my life
p25
aVfor the rest of my life,
p26
aVchronologically compiling these one-second
p27
aVtiny slices of my life into one single continuous video
p28
aVuntil, you know, I can't record them anymore.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe purpose of this project is, one:
p31
aVI hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.
p32
aVThere's all these things that I've done with my life
p33
aVthat I have no recollection of
p34
aVunless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,
p35
aV"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."
p36
aVAnd something that I realized early on in the project
p37
aVwas that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,
p38
aVI would probably forget to record the video.
p39
aVSo the day \u2014 the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,
p40
aVbecause it's something that I really wanted to \u2014
p41
aVfrom the moment that I turned 30, I wanted
p42
aVto keep this project going until forever,
p43
aVand having missed that one second, I realized,
p44
aVit just kind of created this thing in my head
p45
aVwhere I never forgot ever again.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo if I live to see 80 years of age,
p48
aVI'm going to have a five-hour video
p49
aVthat encapsulates 50 years of my life.
p50
aVWhen I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video
p51
aVthat includes just my 30s.
p52
aVThis has really
p53
aVinvigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,
p54
aVto try and do something interesting with my day.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, one of the things that I have issues with is that,
p57
aVas the days and weeks and months go by,
p58
aVtime just seems to start blurring
p59
aVand blending into each other
p60
aVand, you know, I hated that,
p61
aVand visualization is the way to trigger memory.
p62
aVYou know, this project for me is a way for me
p63
aVto bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.
p64
aVEven just this one second allows me to remember
p65
aVeverything else I did that one day.
p66
aVIt's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.
p67
aVOn a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds
p68
aVthat I really want to choose,
p69
aVbut I'll just have to narrow it down to one,
p70
aVbut even narrowing it down to that one allows me
p71
aVto remember the other three anyway.
p72
aa(lp73
VIt's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,
p74
aVagainst the culture we have now where people
p75
aVjust are at concerts with their cell phones out
p76
aVrecording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.
p77
aVThey're not even enjoying the show.
p78
aVThey're watching the concert through their cell phone.
p79
aVI hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,
p80
aVback in the day, and I've decided that the best way
p81
aVfor me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life
p82
aVand not be that person, is to just record that one second
p83
aVthat will allow me to trigger that memory of,
p84
aV"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."
p85
aVAnd it just takes a quick, quick second.
p86
aa(lp87
VI was on a three-month road trip this summer.
p88
aVIt was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,
p89
aVjust driving around the U.S. and Canada
p90
aVand just figuring out where to go the next day,
p91
aVand it was kind of outstanding.
p92
aVI actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip
p93
aVfor the savings that I had to take my year off,
p94
aVso I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time
p95
aVwith friends working on a really neat project.
p96
aVOne of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,
p97
aVand this really tragic thing happened where
p98
aVmy sister-in-law,
p99
aVher intestine suddenly strangled one day,
p100
aVand we took her to the emergency room,
p101
aVand she was, she was in really bad shape.
p102
aVWe almost lost her a couple of times,
p103
aVand I was there with my brother every day.
p104
aVIt helped me realize something else during this project,
p105
aVis that recording that one second on a really bad day
p106
aVis extremely difficult.
p107
aVIt's not \u2014 we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.
p108
aVOr we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."
p109
aVBut we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,
p110
aVand something horrible is happening.
p111
aVAnd I found that it's actually been very, very important
p112
aVto record even just that one second of a really bad moment.
p113
aVIt really helps you appreciate the good times.
p114
aVIt's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,
p115
aVI think it's important to remember it,
p116
aVjust as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,
p119
aVI don't use anything to \u2014 I try to capture the moment
p120
aVas much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.
p121
aVI started a rule of first person perspective.
p122
aVEarly on, I think I had a couple of videos where
p123
aVyou would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.
p124
aVThe way to really remember what I saw
p125
aVwas to record it as I actually saw it.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,
p128
aVwouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?
p129
aVI turned 31 last week, which is there.
p130
aVI think it would be interesting to see
p131
aVwhat everyone did with a project like this.
p132
aVI think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
p133
aVI think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
p134
aVPersonally, I'm tired of forgetting,
p135
aVand this is a really easy thing to do.
p136
aVI mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now \u2014
p137
aVmost people in this room, I bet \u2014
p138
aVand it's something that's \u2014
p139
aVI never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,
p140
aVand this is my way of doing that,
p141
aVand it'd be really interesting also to see,
p142
aVif you could just type in on a website,
p143
aV"June 18, 2018,"
p144
aVand you would just see a stream of people's lives
p145
aVon that particular day from all over the world.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,
p148
aVand I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,
p149
aVso you can never forget that that day, you lived.
p150
aa(lp151
