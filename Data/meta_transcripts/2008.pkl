VI'm excited to be here to speak about vets,
p4
aVbecause I didn't join the Army
p5
aVbecause I wanted to go to war.
p6
aVI didn't join the Army because I had a lust
p7
aVor a need to go overseas and fight.
p8
aVFrankly, I joined the Army because
p9
aVcollege is really damn expensive,
p10
aVand they were going to help with that,
p11
aVand I joined the Army because
p12
aVit was what I knew,
p13
aVand it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.
p14
aa(lp15
VI didn't come from a military family.
p16
aVI'm not a military brat.
p17
aVNo one in my family ever had joined the military at all,
p18
aVand how I first got introduced to the military
p19
aVwas when I was 13 years old
p20
aVand I got sent away to military school,
p21
aVbecause my mother had been threatening me
p22
aVwith this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old.
p23
aa(lp24
VI had some issues when I was coming up,
p25
aVand my mother would always tell me, she's like,
p26
aV"You know, if you don't get this together,
p27
aVI'm going to send you to military school."
p28
aVAnd I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,
p29
aVI'll work harder."
p30
aVAnd then when I was nine years old,
p31
aVshe started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around,
p32
aVso I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,
p33
aV"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're serious, and I'll work harder."
p34
aVAnd then when I was 10 and 11,
p35
aVmy behavior just kept on getting worse.
p36
aVI was on academic and disciplinary probation
p37
aVbefore I hit double digits,
p38
aVand I first felt handcuffs on my wrists
p39
aVwhen I was 11 years old.
p40
aVAnd so when I was 13 years old,
p41
aVmy mother came up to me, and she was like,
p42
aV"I'm not going to do this anymore.
p43
aVI'm going to send you to military school."
p44
aVAnd I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,
p45
aVI can see you're upset, and I'm going to work harder."
p46
aVAnd she was like, "No, you're going next week."
p47
aVAnd that was how I first got introduced
p48
aVto this whole idea of the military,
p49
aVbecause she thought this was a good idea.
p50
aa(lp51
VI had to disagree with her wholeheartedly
p52
aVwhen I first showed up there,
p53
aVbecause literally in the first four days,
p54
aVI had already run away five times from this school.
p55
aVThey had these big black gates that surrounded the school,
p56
aVand every time they would turn their backs,
p57
aVI would just simply run out of the black gates
p58
aVand take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there,
p59
aVwe can leave at any time.
p60
aVSo I just said, "Well, if that's the case,
p61
aVthen I'd like to leave." (Laughter)
p62
aVAnd it never worked.
p63
aVAnd I kept on getting lost.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut then eventually,
p66
aVafter staying there for a little while,
p67
aVand after the end of that first year
p68
aVat this military school,
p69
aVI realized that I actually was growing up.
p70
aVI realized the things that I enjoyed about this school
p71
aVand the thing that I enjoyed about the structure
p72
aVwas something that I'd never found before:
p73
aVthe fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger,
p74
aVpart of a team, and it actually mattered to people
p75
aVthat I was there,
p76
aVthe fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,
p77
aVbut that it was a real, actually core part
p78
aVof the entire experience.
p79
aVAnd so when it was time for me to actually
p80
aVfinish up high school,
p81
aVI started thinking about what I wanted to do,
p82
aVand just like probably most students,
p83
aVhad no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.
p84
aVAnd I thought about the people who I
p85
aVrespected and admired.
p86
aVI thought about a lot of the people,
p87
aVin particular a lot of the men, in my life
p88
aVwho I looked up to.
p89
aVThey all happened to wear the uniform
p90
aVof the United States of America,
p91
aVso for me, the question and the answer
p92
aVreally became pretty easy.
p93
aVThe question of what I wanted to do
p94
aVwas filled in very quickly with saying,
p95
aVI guess I'll be an Army officer.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo the Army then went through this process
p98
aVand they trained me up,
p99
aVand when I say I didn't join the Army
p100
aVbecause I wanted to go to war,
p101
aVthe truth is, I joined in 1996.
p102
aVThere really wasn't a whole lot going on.
p103
aVI didn't ever feel like I was in danger.
p104
aVWhen I went to my mom,
p105
aVI first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,
p106
aVso I literally needed parental permission
p107
aVto join the Army,
p108
aVso I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,
p109
aVand she just assumed it was kind of like military school.
p110
aVShe was like, "Well, it was good for him before,
p111
aVso I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"
p112
aVhaving no idea that the paperwork that she was signing
p113
aVwas actually signing her son up
p114
aVto become an Army officer.
p115
aVAnd I went through the process,
p116
aVand again the whole time still just thinking,
p117
aVthis is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,
p118
aVor two weeks during the year, do drill,
p119
aVand then a couple years after I signed up,
p120
aVa couple years after my mother signed those papers,
p121
aVthe whole world changed.
p122
aVAnd after 9/11, there was an entirely new context
p123
aVabout the occupation that I chose.
p124
aVWhen I first joined, I never joined to fight,
p125
aVbut now that I was in,
p126
aVthis is exactly what was now going to happen.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I thought about so much about the soldiers
p129
aVwho I eventually had to end up leading.
p130
aVI remember when we first, right after 9/11,
p131
aVthree weeks after 9/11, I was on a plane heading overseas,
p132
aVbut I wasn't heading overseas with the military,
p133
aVI was heading overseas because I got a scholarship
p134
aVto go overseas.
p135
aVI received the scholarship to go overseas
p136
aVand to go study and live overseas,
p137
aVand I was living in England and that was interesting,
p138
aVbut at the same time, the same people who
p139
aVI was training with,
p140
aVthe same soldiers that I went through all my training with,
p141
aVand we prepared for war,
p142
aVthey were now actually heading over to it.
p143
aVThey were now about to find themselves
p144
aVin the middle of places the fact is
p145
aVthe vast majority of people,
p146
aVthe vast majority of us as we were training,
p147
aVcouldn't even point out on a map.
p148
aVI spent a couple years finishing graduate school,
p149
aVand the whole entire time while I'm sitting there
p150
aVin buildings at Oxford
p151
aVthat were literally built hundreds of years
p152
aVbefore the United States was even founded,
p153
aVand I'm sitting there talking to dons
p154
aVabout the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,
p155
aVand how that influenced the start of World War I,
p156
aVwhere the entire time my heart and my head
p157
aVwere on my soldiers
p158
aVwho were now throwing on Kevlars
p159
aVand grabbing their flak vests
p160
aVand figuring out how exactly do I change around
p161
aVor how exactly do I clean a machine gun
p162
aVin the darkness.
p163
aVThat was the new reality.
p164
aa(lp165
VBy the time I finished that up and I rejoined
p166
aVmy military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan,
p167
aVthere were soldiers in my unit who were now
p168
aVon their second and third deployments
p169
aVbefore I even had my first.
p170
aVI remember walking out with my unit for the first time,
p171
aVand when you join the Army
p172
aVand you go through a combat tour,
p173
aVeveryone looks at your shoulder,
p174
aVbecause on your shoulder is your combat patch.
p175
aVAnd so immediately as you meet people,
p176
aVyou shake their hand,
p177
aVand then your eyes go to their shoulder,
p178
aVbecause you want to see where did they serve,
p179
aVor what unit did they serve with?
p180
aVAnd I was the only person walking around
p181
aVwith a bare shoulder,
p182
aVand it burned every time someone stared at it.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,
p185
aVand you ask them why did they sign up.
p186
aVI signed up because college was expensive.
p187
aVA lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons.
p188
aVThey signed up because of a sense of obligation.
p189
aVThey signed up because they were angry
p190
aVand they wanted to do something about it.
p191
aVThey signed up because
p192
aVtheir family said this was important.
p193
aVThey signed up because they wanted some form of revenge.
p194
aVThey signed for a whole collection of different reasons.
p195
aVAnd now we all found ourselves overseas
p196
aVfighting in these conflicts.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd what was amazing to me was that I
p199
aVvery naively started hearing this statement
p200
aVthat I never fully understood,
p201
aVbecause right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea
p202
aVwhere people come up to you and they say,
p203
aV"Well, thank you for your service."
p204
aVAnd I just kind of followed in and started saying
p205
aVthe same things to all my soldiers.
p206
aVThis is even before I deployed.
p207
aVBut I really had no idea what that even meant.
p208
aVI just said it because it sounded right.
p209
aVI said it because it sounded like the right thing to say
p210
aVto people who had served overseas.
p211
aV"Thank you for your service."
p212
aVBut I had no idea what the context was
p213
aVor what that even,
p214
aVwhat it even meant to the people who heard it.
p215
aa(lp216
VWhen I first came back from Afghanistan,
p217
aVI thought that if you make it back from conflict,
p218
aVthen the dangers were all over.
p219
aVI thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone
p220
aVthat somehow you could kind of
p221
aVwipe the sweat off your brow and say,
p222
aV"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"
p223
aVwithout understanding that for so many people,
p224
aVas they come back home,
p225
aVthe war keeps going.
p226
aVIt keeps playing out in all of our minds.
p227
aVIt plays out in all of our memories.
p228
aVIt plays out in all of our emotions.
p229
aVPlease forgive us
p230
aVif we don't like being in big crowds.
p231
aVPlease forgive us
p232
aVwhen we spend one week in a place
p233
aVthat has 100 percent light discipline,
p234
aVbecause you're not allowed to walk around with white lights,
p235
aVbecause if anything has a white light,
p236
aVit can be seen from miles away,
p237
aVversus if you use little green
p238
aVor little blue lights,
p239
aVthey cannot be seen from far away.
p240
aVSo please forgive us if out of nowhere,
p241
aVwe go from having 100 percent light discipline
p242
aVto then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square,
p243
aVand we have a difficult time adjusting to that.
p244
aVPlease forgive us
p245
aVwhen you transition back to a family
p246
aVwho has completely been maneuvering without you,
p247
aVand now when you come back, it's not that easy
p248
aVto fall back into a sense of normality,
p249
aVbecause the whole normal has changed.
p250
aa(lp251
VI remember when I came back, I wanted to talk to people.
p252
aVI wanted people to ask me about my experiences.
p253
aVI wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
p254
aV"What did you do?"
p255
aVI wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
p256
aV"What was it like? What was the food like?
p257
aVWhat was the experience like? How are you doing?"
p258
aVAnd the only questions I got from people was,
p259
aV"Did you shoot anybody?"
p260
aVAnd those were the ones who were even curious
p261
aVenough to say anything.
p262
aVBecause sometimes there's this fear
p263
aVand there's this apprehension that if I say anything,
p264
aVI'm afraid I'll offend,
p265
aVor I'm afraid I'll trigger something,
p266
aVso the common default is just saying nothing.
p267
aVThe problem with that
p268
aVis then it feels like your service
p269
aVwas not even acknowledged,
p270
aVlike no one even cared.
p271
aV"Thank you for your service,"
p272
aVand we move on.
p273
aVWhat I wanted to better understand
p274
aVwas what's behind that,
p275
aVand why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.
p276
aVThe fact is, we have literally
p277
aV2.6 million men and women
p278
aVwho are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan
p279
aVwho are all amongst us.
p280
aVSometimes we know who they are,
p281
aVsometimes we don't,
p282
aVbut there is that feeling, the shared experience,
p283
aVthe shared bond
p284
aVwhere we know that that experience
p285
aVand that chapter of our life,
p286
aVwhile it might be closed,
p287
aVit's still not over.
p288
aa(lp289
VWe think about "thank you for your service,"
p290
aVand people say, "So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you?"
p291
aVWell, "Thank you for your service" means to me,
p292
aVit means acknowledging our stories,
p293
aVasking us who we are,
p294
aVunderstanding the strength
p295
aVthat so many people, so many people who we serve with, have,
p296
aVand why that service means so much.
p297
aV"Thank you for your service" means acknowledging the fact
p298
aVthat just because we've now come home
p299
aVand we've taken off the uniform
p300
aVdoes not mean our larger service to this country
p301
aVis somehow over.
p302
aVThe fact is, there's still a tremendous amount
p303
aVthat can be offered and can be given.
p304
aVWhen I look at people
p305
aVlike our friend Taylor Urruela,
p306
aVwho in Iraq loses his leg,
p307
aVhad two big dreams in his life.
p308
aVOne was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player.
p309
aVHe loses his leg in Iraq.
p310
aVHe comes back
p311
aVand instead of deciding that,
p312
aVwell, now since I've lost my leg, that second dream is over,
p313
aVhe decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball,
p314
aVand he starts this group called VETSports,
p315
aVwhich now works with veterans all over the country
p316
aVand uses sports as a way of healing.
p317
aVPeople like Tammy Duckworth,
p318
aVwho was a helicopter pilot
p319
aVand with the helicopter that she was flying,
p320
aVyou need to use both your hands
p321
aVand also your legs to steer,
p322
aVand her helicopter gets hit,
p323
aVand she's trying to steer the chopper,
p324
aVbut the chopper's not reacting
p325
aVto her instructions and to her commands.
p326
aVShe's trying to land the chopper safely,
p327
aVbut the chopper doesn't land safely,
p328
aVand the reason it's not landing safely
p329
aVis because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving
p330
aVbecause her legs were blown off.
p331
aVShe barely survives.
p332
aVMedics come and they save her life,
p333
aVbut then as she's doing her recuperation back at home,
p334
aVshe realizes that, "My job's still not done."
p335
aVAnd now she uses her voice
p336
aVas a Congresswoman from Illinois
p337
aVto fight and advocate for a collection of issues
p338
aVto include veterans issues.
p339
aa(lp340
VWe signed up because
p341
aVwe love this country we represent.
p342
aVWe signed up because
p343
aVwe believe in the idea and we believe in the people
p344
aVto our left and to our right.
p345
aVAnd the only thing we then ask is that
p346
aV"thank you for your service"
p347
aVneeds to be more than just a quote break,
p348
aVthat "thank you for your service" means
p349
aVhonestly digging in
p350
aVto the people who have stepped up
p351
aVsimply because they were asked to,
p352
aVand what that means for us not just now,
p353
aVnot just during combat operations,
p354
aVbut long after the last vehicle has left
p355
aVand after the last shot has been taken.
p356
aa(lp357
VThese are the people who I served with,
p358
aVand these are the people who I honor.
p359
aVSo thank you for your service.
