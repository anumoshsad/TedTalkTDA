(lp3
VI have the feeling that we can all agree
p4
aVthat we're moving towards a new
p5
aVmodel of the state and society.
p6
aVBut, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is
p7
aVor what it should be.
p8
aVIt seems like we need to have
p9
aVa conversation about democracy
p10
aa(lp11
Vin our day and age.
p12
aVLet's think about it this way:
p13
aVWe are 21st-century citizens, doing our
p14
aVvery, very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions
p15
aVthat are based on an information technology of the 15th century.
p16
aVLet's have a look at some of the
p17
aVcharacteristics of this system.
p18
aVFirst of all, it's designed for an information technology
p19
aVthat's over 500 years old.
p20
aVAnd the best possible system
p21
aVthat could be designed for it
p22
aVis one where the few make daily decisions
p23
aVin the name of the many.
p24
aVAnd the many get to vote once every  couple of years.
p25
aVIn the second place, the costs of
p26
aVparticipating in this system are
p27
aVincredibly high.
p28
aVYou either have to have a fair  bit of money
p29
aVand influence, or you have to devote your entire
p30
aVlife to politics.
p31
aVYou have to become a party member
p32
aVand slowly start working up the ranks
p33
aVuntil maybe, one day, you'll get  to sit at a table
p34
aVwhere a decision is being made.
p35
aVAnd last but not least,
p36
aVthe language of the system \u2014
p37
aVit's incredibly cryptic.
p38
aVIt's done for lawyers, by lawyers,
p39
aa(lp40
Vand no one else can understand.
p41
aVSo, it's a system where we can
p42
aVchoose our authorities,
p43
aVbut we are completely left out on how those authorities
p44
aVreach their decisions.
p45
aVSo, in a day where a new information technology
p46
aVallows us to participate globally in any conversation,
p47
aVour barriers of information are completely lowered
p48
aVand we can, more than ever before,
p49
aVexpress our desires and our concerns.
p50
aVOur political system remains the same
p51
aVfor the past 200 years
p52
aVand expects us to be contented with being  simply passive recipients
p53
aa(lp54
Vof a monologue.
p55
aVSo, it's really not surprising that
p56
aVthis kind of system is only able to produce
p57
aVtwo kinds of results:
p58
aVsilence or noise.
p59
aVSilence, in terms of citizens not engaging,
p60
aVsimply not wanting to participate.
p61
aVThere's this commonplace  [idea] that I truly, truly dislike,
p62
aVand it's this idea that we citizens are naturally
p63
aVapathetic. That we shun commitment.
p64
aVBut, can you really blame us
p65
aVfor not jumping at the opportunity of going
p66
aVto the middle of the city in the middle
p67
aVof a working day to attend, physically,
p68
aVa public hearing that has no impact
p69
aVwhatsoever?
p70
aVConflict is bound to happen between a system
p71
aVthat no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,
p72
aVand citizens that are increasingly used
p73
aVto representing themselves.
p74
aVAnd, then we find noise:
p75
aVChile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico Italy, France, Spain, the United States,
p76
aVthey're all democracies.
p77
aVTheir citizens have access to
p78
aVthe ballot boxes. But they still feel the need,
p79
aa(lp80
Vthey need to take to the streets in order  to be heard.
p81
aVTo me, it seems like the 18th-century
p82
aVslogan that was the basis for the formation
p83
aVof our modern democracies, "No taxation
p84
aVwithout representation,"
p85
aVcan now be updated to "No representation without a conversation."
p86
aVWe want our seat at the table.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd rightly so.
p89
aVBut in order to be part of this conversation,
p90
aVwe need to know what we want to do next,
p91
aVbecause political action is being able
p92
aVto move from agitation
p93
aVto construction.
p94
aVMy generation has been incredibly good at
p95
aVusing new networks and technologies
p96
aVto organize protests,
p97
aVprotests that were able to successfully
p98
aVimpose agendas,
p99
aVroll back extremely pernicious legislation,
p100
aVand even overthrow authoritarian governments.
p101
aVAnd we should be immensely
p102
aVproud of this.
p103
aVBut, we also must admit that we
p104
aVhaven't been good at using those
p105
aVsame networks and technologies
p106
aVto successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing
p107
aVand find the consensus and build  the alliances that are needed
p108
aa(lp109
Vto make it happen.
p110
aVAnd so the risk that we face
p111
aVis that we can create these huge power vacuums
p112
aVthat will very quickly get filled up by de facto
p113
aVpowers, like the military or highly
p114
aVmotivated and already organized groups
p115
aa(lp116
Vthat generally lie on the extremes.
p117
aVBut our democracy is neither
p118
aVjust a matter of voting once every
p119
aVcouple of years.
p120
aVBut it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets.
p121
aVSo the question I'd like to raise here,
p122
aVand I do believe it's the most important  question we need to answer,
p123
aVis this one:
p124
aVIf Internet is the new printing press,
p125
aVthen what is democracy for the Internet era?
p126
aVWhat institutions do we want to build
p127
aa(lp128
Vfor the 21st-century society?
p129
aVI don't have the answer, just in case.
p130
aVI don't think anyone does.
p131
aVBut I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore.
p132
aVSo, I'd like to share our experience
p133
aVand what we've learned so far
p134
aVand hopefully contribute two cents
p135
aa(lp136
Vto this conversation.
p137
aVTwo years ago, with a group of friends from Argentina,
p138
aVwe started thinking, "how can  we get our representatives,
p139
aVour elected representatives,
p140
aVto represent us?"
p141
aVMarshall McLuhan once said that politics
p142
aVis solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.
p143
aVSo the question that motivated us was,
p144
aVcan we try and solve some of today's problems
p145
aVwith the tools that we use every single day of our lives?
p146
aVOur first approach was to design and develop
p147
aVa piece of software called DemocracyOS.
p148
aVDemocracyOS is an open-source web application
p149
aVthat is designed to become a bridge
p150
aVbetween citizens and their elected representatives
p151
aa(lp152
Vto make it easier for us to participate  from our everyday lives.
p153
aVSo first of all, you can get informed so every new
p154
aVproject that gets introduced in Congress
p155
aVgets immediately translated and explained
p156
aVin plain language on this platform.
p157
aVBut we all know that social change
p158
aVis not going to come from just knowing
p159
aVmore information,
p160
aVbut from doing something with it.
p161
aVSo better access to information
p162
aVshould lead to a conversation
p163
aVabout what we're going to do next,
p164
aVand DemocracyOS allows for that.
p165
aVBecause we believe that democracy is
p166
aVnot just a matter of stacking up
p167
aVpreferences, one on top of each other,
p168
aVbut that our healthy and robust public debate
p169
aa(lp170
Vshould be, once again, one of its fundamental values.
p171
aVSo DemocracyOS is about persuading  and being persuaded.
p172
aVIt's about reaching a consensus
p173
aVas much as finding a proper way
p174
aVof channeling our disagreement.
p175
aVAnd finally, you can vote
p176
aVhow you would like your elected  representative to vote.
p177
aVAnd if you do not feel comfortable
p178
aVvoting on a certain issue,
p179
aVyou can always delegate your vote
p180
aVto someone else, allowing
p181
aa(lp182
Vfor a dynamic and emerging social leadership.
p183
aVIt suddenly became very easy for us
p184
aVto simply compare these results
p185
aVwith how our representatives were
p186
aVvoting in Congress.
p187
aVBut, it also became very evident that
p188
aVtechnology was not going to do the trick.
p189
aVWhat we needed to do to was to find
p190
aVactors that were able to
p191
aVgrab this distributed knowledge
p192
aVin society and use it to make better and more fair decisions.
p193
aVSo we reached out to traditional political parties
p194
aVand we offered them DemocracyOS.
p195
aVWe said, "Look, here you have a platform that you can use to build
p196
aVa two-way conversation with your constituencies."
p197
aVAnd yes, we failed.
p198
aVWe failed big time.
p199
aVWe were sent to play  outside like little kids.
p200
aVAmongst other things, we were called naive.
p201
aVAnd I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.
p202
aVBecause the challenges that we face, they're not
p203
aVtechnological, they're cultural.
p204
aVPolitical parties were never willing
p205
aVto change the way they make their decisions.
p206
aVSo it suddenly became a bit obvious
p207
aVthat if we wanted to move forward with this idea,
p208
aa(lp209
Vwe needed to do it ourselves.
p210
aVAnd so we took quite a leap of faith,
p211
aVand in August last year, we founded
p212
aVour own political party,
p213
aVEl Partido de la Red,
p214
aVor the Net Party, in the city of  Buenos Aires.
p215
aVAnd taking an even bigger leap of faith,
p216
aVwe ran for elections in October last year
p217
aVwith this idea:
p218
aVif we want a seat in Congress,
p219
aVour candidate, our representatives
p220
aVwere always going to vote according to
p221
aVwhat citizens decided on DemocracyOS.
p222
aVEvery single project that got introduced
p223
aVin Congress, we were going vote
p224
aVaccording to what citizens decided on an online platform.
p225
aVIt was our way of hacking the political system.
p226
aVWe understood that if we wanted
p227
aVto become part of the conversation,
p228
aVto have a seat at the table,
p229
aVwe needed to become valid stakeholders,
p230
aa(lp231
Vand the only way of doing it is to play by the  system rules.
p232
aVBut we were hacking it in the sense that
p233
aVwe were radically changing the way a political party
p234
aVmakes its decisions.
p235
aVFor the first time, we were making our decisions
p236
aVtogether with those who we were
p237
aa(lp238
Vaffecting directly by those decisions.
p239
aVIt was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party
p240
aVin the city of Buenos Aires.
p241
aVBut it got attention.
p242
aVWe got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,
p243
aVand we came in second for the local options.
p244
aVSo, even if that wasn't enough to win a
p245
aVseat in Congress, it was enough
p246
aVfor us to become part of the conversation,
p247
aVto the extent that next month,
p248
aVCongress, as an institution, is launching
p249
aVfor the first time in Argentina's history,
p250
aVa DemocracyOS to discuss,
p251
aVwith the citizens, three pieces of legislation:
p252
aVtwo on urban transportation and
p253
aa(lp254
Vone on the use of public space.
p255
aVOf course, our elected representatives are not
p256
aVsaying, "Yes, we're going to vote
p257
aVaccording to what citizens decide,"
p258
aVbut they're willing to try.
p259
aVThey're willing to open up a new space
p260
aVfor citizen engagement and hopefully
p261
aa(lp262
Vthey'll be willing to listen as well.
p263
aVOur political system can be transformed,
p264
aVand not by subverting it, by destroying it,
p265
aVbut by rewiring it with the tools that
p266
aa(lp267
VInternet affords us now.
p268
aVBut a real challenge is to find, to design
p269
aVto create, to empower those connectors
p270
aVthat are able to innovate, to transform
p271
aVnoise and silence into signal
p272
aVand finally bring our democracies
p273
aa(lp274
Vto the 21st century.
p275
aVI'm not saying it's easy.
p276
aVBut in our experience, we actually stand a chance
p277
aVof making it work.
p278
aVAnd in my heart, it's most definitely
p279
aVworth trying.
p280
aVThank you.
