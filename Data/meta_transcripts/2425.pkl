VYou may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone
p4
aVor Arua, Nigeria.
p5
aVBut I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
p6
aa(lp7
VIn hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists
p8
aVthat have been quietly battling
p9
aVone of the deadliest threats to humanity for years:
p10
aVLassa virus.
p11
aVLassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
p12
aVIt can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
p13
aVBut these individuals, they risk their lives every day
p14
aVto protect the individuals in their communities,
p15
aVand by doing so, protect us all.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them
p18
aVon one of my first visits out there many years ago
p19
aVwas that they start each morning \u2014
p20
aVthese challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines \u2014 by singing.
p21
aVThey gather together, and they show their joy.
p22
aVThey show their spirit.
p23
aVAnd over the years,
p24
aVfrom year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me,
p25
aVI get to gather with them and I sing
p26
aVand we write and we love it,
p27
aVbecause it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together;
p28
aVwe're bonded through a shared humanity.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important,
p31
aVeven essential, as things begin to change.
p32
aVAnd that changed a great deal in March of 2014,
p33
aVwhen the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
p34
aVThis is the first outbreak in West Africa,
p35
aVnear the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
p36
aVAnd it was frightening, frightening for us all.
p37
aVWe had actually suspected for some time
p38
aVthat Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought,
p39
aVand we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so members of my team immediately went out
p42
aVand joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there,
p43
aVand we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests
p44
aVto pick up Ebola if it came across the border
p45
aVand into Sierra Leone.
p46
aVWe'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus,
p47
aVwe knew how to do it,
p48
aVthe team is outstanding.
p49
aVWe just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd unfortunately, that day came.
p52
aVOn May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital,
p53
aVand the team ran those important molecular tests
p54
aVand they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
p55
aVThis was an exceptional work that was done.
p56
aVThey were able to diagnose the case immediately,
p57
aVto safely treat the patient
p58
aVand to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
p59
aVIt could've stopped something.
p60
aVBut by the time that day came,
p61
aVthe outbreak had already been breeding for months.
p62
aVWith hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
p63
aVAnd it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case,
p64
aVbut as a tidal wave.
p65
aa(lp66
VWe had to work with the international community,
p67
aVwith the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases,
p68
aVas the next week brought 31,
p69
aVthen 92, then 147 cases \u2014 all coming to Kenema,
p70
aVone of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could,
p73
aVtrying to help the individuals, trying to get attention,
p74
aVbut we also did one other simple thing.
p75
aVFrom that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,
p76
aVwe can discard it, obviously.
p77
aVThe other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it,
p78
aVso just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean,
p79
aVand that's what we did.
p80
aVWe sent it to Boston, where my team works.
p81
aVAnd we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day,
p82
aVand we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
p83
aVThis is the blueprint \u2014 the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
p84
aVWe all have one.
p85
aVIt says everything that makes up us,
p86
aVand it tells us so much information.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
p89
aVWe could actually take these 99 different viruses,
p90
aVlook at them and compare them,
p91
aVand we could see, actually, compared to three genomes
p92
aVthat had been previously published from Guinea,
p93
aVwe could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before,
p94
aVonce into the human population,
p95
aVand from there had been transmitting from human to human.
p96
aVNow, that's incredibly important
p97
aVwhen you're trying to figure out how to intervene,
p98
aVbut the important thing is contact tracing.
p99
aVWe also could see that as the virus was moving between humans,
p100
aVit was mutating.
p101
aVAnd each of those mutations are so important,
p102
aVbecause the diagnostics, the vaccines,
p103
aVthe therapies that we're using,
p104
aVare all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally \u2014
p105
aVthat's what drives it.
p106
aVAnd so global health experts would need to respond,
p107
aVwould have to develop,
p108
aVto recalibrate everything that they were doing.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut the way that science works, the position I was in at that point
p111
aVis, I had the data,
p112
aVand I could have worked in a silo for many, many months,
p113
aVanalyzed the data carefully, slowly,
p114
aVsubmitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths,
p115
aVand then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
p116
aVThat's the way the status quo works.
p117
aa(lp118
VWell, that was not going to work at this point, right?
p119
aVWe had friends on the front lines
p120
aVand to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help,
p121
aVlots of help.
p122
aVSo the first thing we did is,
p123
aVas soon as the sequences came off the machines,
p124
aVwe published it to the web.
p125
aVWe just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
p126
aVAnd help came.
p127
aa(lp128
VBefore we knew it,
p129
aVwe were being contacted from people all over,
p130
aVsurprised to see the data out there and released.
p131
aVSome of the greatest viral trackers in the world
p132
aVwere suddenly part of our community.
p133
aVWe were working together in this virtual way,
p134
aVsharing, regular calls, communications,
p135
aVtrying to follow the virus minute by minute,
p136
aVto see ways that we could stop it.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
p139
aVEverybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally,
p140
aVwas reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
p141
aVEverybody wants to play a part.
p142
aVThe amount of human capacity out there is just amazing,
p143
aVand the Internet connects us all.
p144
aVAnd could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other,
p145
aVthat we all just said, "Let's do this.
p146
aVLet's work together, and let's make this happen."
p147
aa(lp148
VBut the problem is that the data that all of us are using,
p149
aVGoogling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
p150
aVAnd so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
p151
aVSo in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema,
p152
aVwe'd had 106 clinical records from patients,
p153
aVand we once again made that publicly available to the world.
p154
aVAnd in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records,
p155
aVwe could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients
p156
aVto near 100 percent accuracy.
p157
aVAnd we made an app that could release that,
p158
aVto make that available to health-care workers in the field.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut 106 is just not enough to make it powerful,
p161
aVto validate it.
p162
aVSo we were waiting for more data to release that.
p163
aVand the data has still not come.
p164
aVWe are still waiting, tweaking away,
p165
aVin silos rather than working together.
p166
aVAnd this just \u2014 we can't accept that.
p167
aVRight? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
p168
aVIt's our lives on the line.
p169
aVAnd in fact, actually,
p170
aVmany lives were lost, many health-care workers,
p171
aVincluding beloved colleagues of mine,
p172
aVfive colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,
p173
aVDr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
p174
aVThese are just five of many health-care workers
p175
aVat Kenema and beyond
p176
aVthat died while the world waited and while we all worked,
p177
aVquietly and separately.
p178
aa(lp179
VSee, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,
p180
aVit's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
p181
aVWhen we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves,
p182
aVthe virus thrives.
p183
aVBut unlike all threats to humanity,
p184
aVEbola is one where we're actually all the same.
p185
aVWe're all in this fight together.
p186
aVEbola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
p187
aVAnd so in this place with the same vulnerabilities,
p188
aVthe same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes,
p189
aVI hope that we work together with joy.
p190
aa(lp191
VA graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone,
p192
aVand she discovered that the word "Kenema,"
p193
aVthe hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone,
p194
aVis named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent
p195
aVand open to the public gaze."
p196
aVThat was really profound for us,
p197
aVbecause without knowing it, we'd always felt
p198
aVthat in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked,
p199
aVwe had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
p200
aVAnd we have to do that.
p201
aVWe all have to demand that of ourselves and others \u2014
p202
aVto be open to each other when an outbreak happens,
p203
aVto fight in this fight together.
p204
aVBecause this is not the first outbreak of Ebola,
p205
aVit will not be the last,
p206
aVand there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait,
p207
aVlike Lassa virus and others.
p208
aVAnd the next time this happens,
p209
aVit could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
p210
aVIt could be something that's transmitted through the air.
p211
aVIt could even be disseminated intentionally.
p212
aVAnd I know that that is frightening, I understand that,
p213
aVbut I know also, and this experience shows us,
p214
aVthat we have the technology and we have the capacity
p215
aVto win this thing,
p216
aVto win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
p217
aVBut we can only do it if we do it together
p218
aVand we do it with joy.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo for Dr. Khan
p221
aVand for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines
p222
aVin this fight with us always,
p223
aVlet us be in this fight with them always.
p224
aVAnd let us not let the world be defined
p225
aVby the destruction wrought by one virus,
p226
aVbut illuminated by billions of hearts and minds
p227
aVworking in unity.
p228
