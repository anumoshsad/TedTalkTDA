VNow this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,
p4
aVbut let's kick off the afternoon
p5
aVwith a message
p6
aVfrom a mystery sponsor.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnonymous: Dear Fox News,
p9
aVit has come to our unfortunate attention
p10
aVthat both the name and nature of Anonymous
p11
aVhas been ravaged.
p12
aVWe are everyone. We are no one.
p13
aVWe are anonymous. We are legion.
p14
aVWe do not forgive. We do not forget.
p15
aVWe are but the base of chaos.
p16
aa(lp17
VMisha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen \u2014
p18
aVa sophisticated group
p19
aVof politically motivated hackers
p20
aVwho have emerged in 2011.
p21
aVAnd they're pretty scary.
p22
aVYou never know when they're going to attack next,
p23
aVwho or what the consequences will be.
p24
aVBut interestingly,
p25
aVthey have a sense of humor.
p26
aVThese guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account
p27
aVto announce President Obama's assassination.
p28
aVNow you can imagine the panic that would have generated
p29
aVin the newsroom at Fox.
p30
aV"What do we do now?
p31
aVPut on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVAnd of course, who could escape the irony
p34
aVof a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
p35
aVbeing a victim of hacking for a change.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V(Applause)
p40
aa(lp41
VSometimes you turn on the news
p42
aVand you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"
p43
aVSony Playstation Network \u2014 done,
p44
aVthe government of Turkey \u2014 tick,
p45
aVBritain's Serious Organized Crime Agency \u2014 a breeze,
p46
aVthe CIA \u2014 falling off a log.
p47
aVIn fact, a friend of mine from the security industry
p48
aVtold me the other day
p49
aVthat there are two types of companies in the world:
p50
aVthose that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.
p51
aVI mean three companies
p52
aVproviding cybersecurity services to the FBI
p53
aVhave been hacked.
p54
aVIs nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?
p55
aa(lp56
VAnyway, this mysterious group Anonymous \u2014
p57
aVand they would say this themselves \u2014
p58
aVthey are providing a service
p59
aVby demonstrating how useless companies are
p60
aVat protecting our data.
p61
aVBut there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous \u2014
p62
aVthey are ideologically driven.
p63
aVThey claim that they are battling
p64
aVa dastardly conspiracy.
p65
aVThey say that governments are trying
p66
aVto take over the Internet and control it,
p67
aVand that they, Anonymous,
p68
aVare the authentic voice of resistance \u2014
p69
aVbe it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,
p70
aVagainst global media corporations,
p71
aVor against intelligence agencies,
p72
aVor whoever it is.
p73
aVAnd their politics are not entirely unattractive.
p74
aVOkay, they're a little inchoate.
p75
aVThere's a strong whiff
p76
aVof half-baked anarchism about them.
p77
aVBut one thing is true:
p78
aVwe are at the beginning
p79
aVof a mighty struggle
p80
aVfor control of the Internet.
p81
aVThe Web links everything,
p82
aVand very soon
p83
aVit will mediate most human activity.
p84
aVBecause the Internet has fashioned
p85
aVa new and complicated environment
p86
aVfor an old-age dilemma
p87
aVthat pits the demands of security
p88
aVwith the desire for freedom.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow this is a very complicated struggle.
p91
aVAnd unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,
p92
aVwe probably can't understand it very well.
p93
aVNonetheless,
p94
aVin an unexpected attack of hubris
p95
aVa couple of years ago,
p96
aVI decided I would try and do that.
p97
aVAnd I sort of get it.
p98
aVThese were the various things that I was looking at
p99
aVas I was trying to understand it.
p100
aVBut in order to try and explain the whole thing,
p101
aVI would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,
p102
aVso you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,
p103
aVand let me assure you that all of these issues
p104
aVare involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet
p105
aVone way or the other,
p106
aVbut in a configuration
p107
aVthat even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty
p108
aVtrying to get his head around.
p109
aVSo there you are.
p110
aVAnd as you see, in the middle,
p111
aVthere is our old friend, the hacker.
p112
aVThe hacker is absolutely central
p113
aVto many of the political, social
p114
aVand economic issues affecting the Net.
p115
aVAnd so I thought to myself,
p116
aV"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."
p117
aVAnd what do you know,
p118
aVnobody else does talk to the hackers.
p119
aVThey're completely anonymous, as it were.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo despite the fact
p122
aVthat we are beginning to pour billions,
p123
aVhundreds of billions of dollars,
p124
aVinto cybersecurity \u2014
p125
aVfor the most extraordinary technical solutions \u2014
p126
aVno one wants to talk
p127
aVto these guys, the hackers,
p128
aVwho are doing everything.
p129
aVInstead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,
p130
aVwhich cost a huge amount of money.
p131
aVAnd so nothing is going into the hackers.
p132
aVWell, I say nothing,
p133
aVbut actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit
p134
aVin Turin, Italy
p135
aVcalled the Hackers Profiling Project.
p136
aVAnd they are doing some fantastic research
p137
aVinto the characteristics,
p138
aVinto the abilities
p139
aVand the socialization of hackers.
p140
aVBut because they're a U.N. operation,
p141
aVmaybe that's why governments and corporations
p142
aVare not that interested in them.
p143
aVBecause it's a U.N. operation,
p144
aVof course, it lacks funding.
p145
aVBut I think they're doing very important work.
p146
aVBecause where we have a surplus of technology
p147
aVin the cybersecurity industry,
p148
aVwe have a definite lack of \u2014
p149
aVcall me old-fashioned \u2014
p150
aVhuman intelligence.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, so far I've mentioned
p153
aVthe hackers Anonymous
p154
aVwho are a politically motivated hacking group.
p155
aVOf course, the criminal justice system
p156
aVtreats them as common old garden criminals.
p157
aVBut interestingly,
p158
aVAnonymous does not make use of its hacked information
p159
aVfor financial gain.
p160
aVBut what about the real cybercriminals?
p161
aVWell real organized crime on the Internet
p162
aVgoes back about 10 years
p163
aVwhen a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers
p164
aVdeveloped a website,
p165
aVwhich led to the industrialization
p166
aVof cybercrime.
p167
aVWelcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.
p168
aVThis is how they were advertising themselves
p169
aVa decade ago on the Net.
p170
aVNow CarderPlanet was very interesting.
p171
aVCybercriminals would go there
p172
aVto buy and sell stolen credit card details,
p173
aVto exchange information
p174
aVabout new malware that was out there.
p175
aVAnd remember, this is a time
p176
aVwhen we're seeing for the first time
p177
aVso-called off-the-shelf malware.
p178
aVThis is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,
p179
aVwhich you can deploy
p180
aVeven if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket
p183
aVfor cybercriminals.
p184
aVAnd its creators
p185
aVwere incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,
p186
aVbecause they were faced
p187
aVwith one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.
p188
aVAnd that challenge is:
p189
aVHow do you do business,
p190
aVhow do you trust
p191
aVsomebody on the Web who you want to do business with
p192
aVwhen you know that they're a criminal?
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVIt's axiomatic that they're dodgy,
p195
aVand they're going to want to try and rip you off.
p196
aVSo the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,
p197
aVcame up with this brilliant idea
p198
aVcalled the escrow system.
p199
aVThey appointed an officer
p200
aVwho would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
p201
aVThe vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;
p202
aVthe purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.
p203
aVThe purchaser would send the administrative officer
p204
aVsome dollars digitally,
p205
aVand the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.
p206
aVAnd the officer would then verify
p207
aVif the stolen credit card worked.
p208
aVAnd if they did,
p209
aVhe then passed on the money to the vendor
p210
aVand the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.
p211
aVAnd it was this
p212
aVwhich completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.
p213
aVAnd after that, it just went wild.
p214
aVWe had a champagne decade
p215
aVfor people who we know as Carders.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow I spoke to one of these Carders
p218
aVwho we'll call RedBrigade \u2014
p219
aValthough that wasn't even his proper nickname \u2014
p220
aVbut I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.
p221
aVAnd he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004
p222
aVhe would go on sprees in New York,
p223
aVtaking out $10,000 from an ATM here,
p224
aV$30,000 from an ATM there,
p225
aVusing cloned credit cards.
p226
aVHe was making, on average a week,
p227
aV$150,000 \u2014
p228
aVtax free of course.
p229
aVAnd he said
p230
aVthat he had so much money
p231
aVstashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point
p232
aVthat he just didn't know what to do with it
p233
aVand actually fell into a depression.
p234
aVBut that's a slightly different story,
p235
aVwhich I won't go into now.
p236
aVNow the interesting thing about RedBrigade
p237
aVis that he wasn't an advanced hacker.
p238
aVHe sort of understood the technology,
p239
aVand he realized that security was very important
p240
aVif you were going to be a Carder,
p241
aVbut he didn't spend his days and nights
p242
aVbent over a computer, eating pizza,
p243
aVdrinking coke and that sort of thing.
p244
aVHe was out there on the town
p245
aVhaving a fab time enjoying the high life.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd this is because
p248
aVhackers are only one element
p249
aVin a cybercriminal enterprise.
p250
aVAnd often they're the most vulnerable element of all.
p251
aVAnd I want to explain this to you
p252
aVby introducing you to six characters
p253
aVwho I met
p254
aVwhile I was doing this research.
p255
aVDimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT \u2014
p256
aVborn in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.
p257
aVNow he developed his social and moral compass
p258
aVon the Black Sea port during the 1990s.
p259
aVThis was a sink-or-swim environment
p260
aVwhere involvement in criminal or corrupt activities
p261
aVwas entirely necessary
p262
aVif you wanted to survive.
p263
aVAs an accomplished computer user,
p264
aVwhat Dimitry did
p265
aVwas to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown
p266
aVonto the Worldwide Web.
p267
aVAnd he did a great job in it.
p268
aVYou have to understand though
p269
aVthat from his ninth birthday,
p270
aVthe only environment he knew
p271
aVwas gangsterism.
p272
aVHe knew no other way of making a living
p273
aVand making money.
p274
aa(lp275
VThen we have Renukanth Subramaniam,
p276
aVaka JiLsi \u2014
p277
aVfounder of DarkMarket,
p278
aVborn in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
p279
aVAs an eight year-old,
p280
aVhe and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital
p281
aVbecause Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,
p282
aVlooking for Tamils like Renu to murder.
p283
aVAt 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,
p284
aVaccused of being a terrorist,
p285
aVand his parents sent him on his own to Britain
p286
aVas a refugee seeking political asylum.
p287
aVAt 13,
p288
aVwith only little English and being bullied at school,
p289
aVhe escaped into a world of computers
p290
aVwhere he showed great technical ability,
p291
aVbut he was soon being seduced
p292
aVby people on the Internet.
p293
aVHe was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,
p294
aVand he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London
p295
aVin 2012.
p296
aa(lp297
VMatrix001,
p298
aVwho was an administrator at DarkMarket.
p299
aVBorn in Southern Germany
p300
aVto a stable and well-respected middle class family,
p301
aVhis obsession with gaming as a teenager
p302
aVled him to hacking.
p303
aVAnd he was soon controlling huge servers around the world
p304
aVwhere he stored his games
p305
aVthat he had cracked and pirated.
p306
aVHis slide into criminality
p307
aVwas incremental.
p308
aVAnd when he finally woke up to his situation
p309
aVand understood the implications,
p310
aVhe was already in too deep.
p311
aa(lp312
VMax Vision, aka ICEMAN \u2014
p313
aVmastermind of CardersMarket.
p314
aVBorn in Meridian, Idaho.
p315
aVMax Vision was one of the best penetration testers
p316
aVworking out of Santa Clara, California
p317
aVin the late 90s for private companies
p318
aVand voluntarily for the FBI.
p319
aVNow in the late 1990s,
p320
aVhe discovered a vulnerability
p321
aVon all U.S. government networks,
p322
aVand he went in and patched it up \u2014
p323
aVbecause this included nuclear research facilities \u2014
p324
aVsparing the American government
p325
aVa huge security embarrassment.
p326
aVBut also, because he was an inveterate hacker,
p327
aVhe left a tiny digital wormhole
p328
aVthrough which he alone could crawl.
p329
aVBut this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,
p330
aVand he was convicted.
p331
aVAt his open prison,
p332
aVhe came under the influence of financial fraudsters,
p333
aVand those financial fraudsters
p334
aVpersuaded him to work for them
p335
aVon his release.
p336
aVAnd this man with a planetary-sized brain
p337
aVis now serving a 13-year sentence
p338
aVin California.
p339
aa(lp340
VAdewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB \u2014
p341
aVmaster bank account cracker
p342
aVfrom Abuja in Nigeria.
p343
aVHe set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,
p344
aVbankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk
p345
aVbefore arriving in Britain
p346
aVin 2005
p347
aVto take a Masters in chemical engineering
p348
aVat Manchester University.
p349
aVHe impressed in the private sector,
p350
aVdeveloping chemical applications for the oil industry
p351
aVwhile simultaneously running
p352
aVa worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions
p353
aVuntil his arrest in 2008.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,
p356
aVaka Cha0 \u2014
p357
aVone of the most remarkable hackers ever,
p358
aVfrom Ankara in Turkey.
p359
aVHe combined the tremendous skills of a geek
p360
aVwith the suave social engineering skills
p361
aVof the master criminal.
p362
aVOne of the smartest people I've ever met.
p363
aVHe also had the most effective
p364
aVvirtual private network security arrangement
p365
aVthe police have ever encountered
p366
aVamongst global cybercriminals.
p367
aa(lp368
VNow the important thing
p369
aVabout all of these people
p370
aVis they share certain characteristics
p371
aVdespite the fact that they come from very different environments.
p372
aVThey are all people who learned their hacking skills
p373
aVin their early to mid-teens.
p374
aVThey are all people
p375
aVwho demonstrate advanced ability
p376
aVin maths and the sciences.
p377
aVRemember that, when they developed those hacking skills,
p378
aVtheir moral compass had not yet developed.
p379
aVAnd most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,
p380
aVthey did not demonstrate
p381
aVany real social skills in the outside world \u2014
p382
aVonly on the Web.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd the other thing is
p385
aVthe high incidence of hackers like these
p386
aVwho have characteristics which are consistent
p387
aVwith Asperger's syndrome.
p388
aVNow I discussed this
p389
aVwith Professor Simon Baron-Cohen
p390
aVwho's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.
p391
aVAnd he has done path-breaking work on autism
p392
aVand confirmed, also for the authorities here,
p393
aVthat Gary McKinnon \u2014
p394
aVwho is wanted by the United States
p395
aVfor hacking into the Pentagon \u2014
p396
aVsuffers from Asperger's
p397
aVand a secondary condition
p398
aVof depression.
p399
aVAnd Baron-Cohen explained
p400
aVthat certain disabilities
p401
aVcan manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world
p402
aVas tremendous skills,
p403
aVand that we should not be throwing in jail
p404
aVpeople who have such disabilities and skills
p405
aVbecause they have lost their way socially
p406
aVor been duped.
p407
aa(lp408
VNow I think we're missing a trick here,
p409
aVbecause I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.
p410
aVAnd let me be blunt about this.
p411
aVIn China, in Russia and in loads of other countries
p412
aVthat are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,
p413
aVthis is exactly what they are doing.
p414
aVThey are recruiting hackers
p415
aVboth before and after they become involved
p416
aVin criminal and industrial espionage activities \u2014
p417
aVare mobilizing them
p418
aVon behalf of the state.
p419
aVWe need to engage
p420
aVand find ways of offering guidance
p421
aVto these young people,
p422
aVbecause they are a remarkable breed.
p423
aVAnd if we rely, as we do at the moment,
p424
aVsolely on the criminal justice system
p425
aVand the threat of punitive sentences,
p426
aVwe will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you very much for listening.
p429
aa(lp430
V(Applause)
p431
aa(lp432
VChris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading
p433
aVis hire hackers.
p434
aVHow would someone get over that kind of fear
p435
aVthat the hacker they hire
p436
aVmight preserve that little teensy wormhole?
p437
aa(lp438
VMG: I think to an extent,
p439
aVyou have to understand
p440
aVthat it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.
p441
aVThey're just relentless and obsessive
p442
aVabout what they do.
p443
aVBut all of the people who I've spoken to
p444
aVwho have fallen foul of the law,
p445
aVthey have all said, "Please, please give us a chance
p446
aVto work in the legitimate industry.
p447
aVWe just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.
p448
aVWe want to work with you."
p449
