VI spend most of my time
p4
aVthinking about little girls,
p5
aVwhich is kind of a weird thing for a grown man in our society to say.
p6
aVBut I do. I spend most of my time thinking about little girls,
p7
aVand I think it's primarily because I have one.
p8
aVThis one's mine, and I think you would really like her.
p9
aVShe is smart and funny
p10
aVand kind to people and a good friend.
p11
aVBut when I talk about my daughter, the word I find myself saying most
p12
aVis "athlete."
p13
aVMy kid's athletic.
p14
aVShe is strong and fast
p15
aVand has great balance and good body control.
p16
aVShe is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion
p17
aVin Shaolin Kempo.
p18
aVAt nine years old, she is already halfway to a black belt.
p19
aVMy daughter is athletic.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds stands in front of you
p22
aVand says his daughter is athletic,
p23
aVyou might think that's a reflection of him.
p24
aVIt is not.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VMy wife in high school was a two-time all-state soccer player
p29
aVand a two-time all-state volleyball player,
p30
aVand I played "Dungeons and Dragons."
p31
aVAnd that is why,
p32
aValthough my daughter is an athlete,
p33
aVshe's also a huge nerd, which I love.
p34
aVShe walks around our house in a cloak of flames
p35
aVthat she made herself.
p36
aVShe sits on the Iron Throne \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
Veven though she has never seen "Game of Thrones,"
p41
aVprimarily because we are not the worst parents who ever lived.
p42
aVBut she knows there's someone called the Mother of Dragons,
p43
aVand she calls herself that and she loves it.
p44
aVShe's a huge comic book fan.
p45
aVRight now, her favorite character is Groot.
p46
aVShe loves Groot.
p47
aVShe adores The Incredible Hulk.
p48
aVBut my daughter really at heart,
p49
aVher thing is Star Wars.
p50
aVMy kid is a Jedi.
p51
aVAlthough some days she's also a Sith,
p52
aVwhich is a choice that I can respect.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VBut here's the question that I have to ask.
p57
aVWhy is it that when my daughter dresses up,
p58
aVwhether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,
p59
aVwhether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,
p60
aVwhy is every character she dresses up as a boy?
p61
aVAnd where are all the female superheroes?
p62
aVAnd that is not actually the question,
p63
aVbecause there's plenty of female superheroes.
p64
aVMy question really is, where is all the female superhero stuff?
p65
aVWhere are the costumes? Where are the toys?
p66
aa(lp67
VBecause every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up,
p68
aVshe's learning stuff
p69
aVthrough a process that, in my own line of work,
p70
aVas a professor of media studies,
p71
aVwe refer to as public pedagogy.
p72
aVThat is, it is how societies are taught ideologies.
p73
aVIt's how you learned what it meant to be a man or a woman,
p74
aVwhat it meant to behave yourself in public,
p75
aVwhat it meant to be a patriot and have good manners.
p76
aVIt's all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people.
p77
aVIt's, in short, how we learn what we know about other people
p78
aVand about the world.
p79
aVBut we live in a 100-percent media-saturated society.
p80
aVWhat that means is that every single aspect of your human existence
p81
aVoutside of your basic bodily functions
p82
aVis in some way touched by media.
p83
aVFrom the car that you drive to the food that you eat
p84
aVto the clothes that you wear
p85
aVto the way you construct your relationships
p86
aVto the very language you use to formulate thought \u2014
p87
aVall of that is in some way mediated.
p88
aVSo the answer in our society
p89
aVto how do we learn what we know about other people and about the world
p90
aVis largely through media.
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, there's a wrinkle in that,
p93
aVin that our society,
p94
aVmedia don't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices.
p95
aVThey also exist as corporate entities.
p96
aVAnd when the distribution of information is tied to financial gain,
p97
aVthere's a problem.
p98
aVHow big of a problem?
p99
aVWell think about this:
p100
aVin 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies.
p101
aVIn any market, 50 companies doing something is a lot of companies.
p102
aVIt's a lot of different worldviews.
p103
aVIn 2015, that number has shrunk to six,
p104
aVsix companies.
p105
aVThey are NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner,
p106
aVthe Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
p107
aVThese six companies produce nine out of every 10 movies you watch,
p108
aVnine out of every 10 television shows, nine out of every 10 songs,
p109
aVnine out of every 10 books.
p110
aVSo my question to you is,
p111
aVif six companies control 90 percent of American media,
p112
aVhow much influence do you think they have over what you're allowed to see every day?
p113
aa(lp114
VBecause in media studies,
p115
aVwe spend a lot of time saying that media can't tell us what to think,
p116
aVand they can't; they're terrible at that.
p117
aVBut that's not their job.
p118
aVMedia don't tell us what to think.
p119
aVMedia tell us what to think about.
p120
aVThey control the conversation,
p121
aVand in controlling the conversation,
p122
aVthey don't have to get you to think what they want you to think.
p123
aVThey'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about,
p124
aVand more importantly, not thinking about things they don't want you to think about.
p125
aVThey control the conversation.
p126
aa(lp127
VHow does this work in practice?
p128
aVLet's just take one of those companies.
p129
aVWe'll do an easy one.
p130
aVLet's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second.
p131
aVThe reason why I always pick the Walt Disney Company is this.
p132
aVIs there a single person in this room who has never seen a Disney movie?
p133
aVLook around. Exactly.
p134
aVI picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration
p135
aVin our society.
p136
aVEvery single person has been exposed to Disney,
p137
aVso it's an easy one for me to use.
p138
aVSince 1937, Disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls.
p139
aVIt's made a huge chunk of its money.
p140
aVUnless, of course, the princess your daughter is interested in,
p141
aVas my daughter is, is this one.
p142
aa(lp143
VSee, in 2012,
p144
aVDisney purchased LucasFilm for the sum of four billion dollars,
p145
aVand immediately they flooded the Disney stores with Han Solo
p146
aVand Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and Yoda
p147
aVand not Princess Leia.
p148
aVWhy? Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy
p149
aVfor these princesses.
p150
aVSo Disney did not put Princess Leia merchandise in the store,
p151
aVand when people went to Disney and said,
p152
aV"Hey, where's all the Princess Leia stuff?"
p153
aVDisney said, "We have no intention
p154
aVof putting Princess Leia merchandise in the store."
p155
aVAnd fans were angry and they took to Twitter
p156
aVwith the hashtag #WeWantLeia.
p157
aVAnd Disney said, "Wait, that's not what we meant.
p158
aVWhat we meant was,
p159
aVwe don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will."
p160
aVAnd that was in 2012, and it is 2015,
p161
aVand if you go to the Disney Store, as I recently have,
p162
aVand look for Princess Leia merchandise,
p163
aVdo you know how many Princess Leia items there are in the Disney Store?
p164
aVZero, because Disney has no intention of putting Princess Leia in the store.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd we shouldn't be surprised because we found out that was their policy
p167
aVwhen they bought Marvel in 2009
p168
aVfor the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
p169
aVBecause when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls,
p170
aVyou also kind of want to make money from boys.
p171
aVAnd so what better to sell boys than superheroes?
p172
aVSo now Disney had access to Captain America and to Thor,
p173
aVThe Incredible Hulk,
p174
aVand they had access even
p175
aVto a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of.
p176
aVThat's how good Marvel was at selling superheroes.
p177
aa(lp178
VLast year, they released a film called "Guardians of the Galaxy."
p179
aVIt's a film that absolutely should not work.
p180
aVNobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me.
p181
aVOne of the characters is a talking tree.
p182
aVOne of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon.
p183
aVIt should not work.
p184
aVAnd they made a killing off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."
p185
aa(lp186
VThis character here in the middle, her name is Gamora.
p187
aVShe's played by Zoe Saldana,
p188
aVand she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja,
p189
aVand she is played by a beautiful black woman,
p190
aVand my daughter fell in love with her.
p191
aVSo like any good nerd dad, I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,
p192
aVand when I got to the store, I learned a very interesting thing.
p193
aVIf I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,
p194
aVwell, Gamora's not on it.
p195
aVThey probably should have marketed this as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, she wasn't on it,
p200
aVand if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,
p201
aVshe wasn't on it.
p202
aVAnd as a matter of fact,
p203
aVif I went to the store, as I did,
p204
aVand looked at the display,
p205
aVyou would find a small picture of Gamora right here,
p206
aVbut if you look at any of the actual merchandise on that shelf,
p207
aVGamora is not on any of it.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, I could have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #WheresGamora,
p210
aVlike millions of fans did across the world,
p211
aVbut the truth was I wasn't even really that surprised,
p212
aVbecause I was there when Disney had released "The Avengers."
p213
aVAnd just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,"
p214
aVand we were very excited,
p215
aVbecause there was not one but two female superheroes,
p216
aVScarlet Witch and Black Widow.
p217
aVAnd we were very excited.
p218
aVBut here's the real thing about this.
p219
aVEven though Scarlett Johansson,
p220
aVwho is one of the most popular actresses in America, plays Black Widow,
p221
aVand Black Widow is the star
p222
aVof not one, not two, but five different Marvel movies,
p223
aVthere is not a single piece of Black Widow merchandise available.
p224
aVNot one.
p225
aVAnd if you go to the Disney store and look for a Black Widow costume,
p226
aVwhat you will find, is you will find Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.
p227
aVYou will find Iron Man and Thor.
p228
aVYou will even find War Machine,
p229
aVwho isn't even really in the movie that long.
p230
aVWho you will not find is Black Widow.
p231
aVAnd I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, as many people did,
p232
aV# WheresNatasha.
p233
aVBut I'm tired of doing that.
p234
aVI'm tired of having to do that.
p235
aa(lp236
VAll over the country right now,
p237
aVthere are kids playing with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set,
p238
aVwhere Captain America rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet
p239
aVand it's really awesome.
p240
aVYou know how awesome it is?
p241
aVSo awesome that when it happened in the movie,
p242
aVit was Black Widow that did it.
p243
aVNot only has she been erased,
p244
aVbut she has been replaced with a male figure.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd so what is this teaching us?
p247
aVI mean, over the next five years,
p248
aVDisney and Warner Bros. and a bunch of movie studios
p249
aVare going to release over 30 feature-length films
p250
aVwith comic book characters,
p251
aVand of those 30 feature-length films,
p252
aVexactly two of them will have female solo leads.
p253
aVTwo.
p254
aVNow, there will be females in the rest of these movies,
p255
aVbut they will be sidekicks, they will be love interests,
p256
aVthey will be members of teams.
p257
aVThey will not be the main character.
p258
aVAnd if what we learn, what we know
p259
aVabout other people and about the world we learn through media,
p260
aVthen these companies are teaching my daughter that even if she is strong
p261
aVand smart and fast and fights like a ninja,
p262
aVall four of which are true of her,
p263
aVit doesn't matter.
p264
aVShe will either be ignored like Gamora
p265
aVor erased and replaced with a boy
p266
aVlike Black Widow.
p267
aVAnd it's not fair.
p268
aVIt's not fair to her and it's not fair to your sons and daughters either.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut here's the thing:
p271
aVI'm raising a little girl, and she has a little tomboy in her,
p272
aVwhich by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl.
p273
aVWhat that basically is saying is, those traits that define you,
p274
aVthey're not really yours,
p275
aVthey're just on loan to you for a little while from boys.
p276
aVBut do you know how much grief she's going to take in her life
p277
aVfor having a little tomboy in her?
p278
aVZero. None.
p279
aVPeople will think it's cute.
p280
aVThey'll call her feisty, because in our society,
p281
aVadding so-called male traits to girls
p282
aVis seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.
p283
aVI'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.
p284
aa(lp285
VMike is a little boy in Florida. He's 11 years old,
p286
aVand the thing that he loves most in the world
p287
aVis a show called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,"
p288
aVlike millions of other children across America.
p289
aVNow, the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine,
p290
aVbut there are millions of boys
p291
aVand grown men
p292
aVwho enjoy "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."
p293
aVThey have a club.
p294
aVThey call themselves Bronies,
p295
aVpony bros, guys who like ponies.
p296
aVI happen to be one of them.
p297
aVAnd what are Mike and myself
p298
aVand millions of other boys and men learning in this feminine,
p299
aVsissified world of "My Little Pony?"
p300
aVWell, they're learning to study hard and to work hard and to party hard
p301
aVand to look good and to feel good
p302
aVand to do good,
p303
aVand heaven preserve us from teaching these wussified concepts to boys.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo the other kids in his neighborhood pick on Mike and they beat him up
p306
aVand they make fun of him,
p307
aVand at 11 years old, Mike goes home,
p308
aVfinds a belt, wraps it around his neck,
p309
aVand hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed.
p310
aVBecause we have developed a society
p311
aVin which you would rather be dead as a boy than thought of as liking stuff for girls.
p312
aVAnd that is not Mike's fault. That is our fault.
p313
aVWe have failed him.
p314
aVWe have failed our children.
p315
aVAnd we have to do better for them.
p316
aVWe have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes
p317
aVappear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls.
p318
aVWe have to stop.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd when I was putting this together, people said to me,
p321
aV"Well, that's never going to happen." And I said, "Oh really?"
p322
aVBecause just this year, Target announced
p323
aVthat they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles.
p324
aVThey were going to mix it up.
p325
aVNow, before we break our shoulders patting Target on the back,
p326
aVjust this week they released a shirt
p327
aVin which one of the most iconic scenes in "Star Wars: A New Hope"
p328
aVwhere Princess Leia stands up to the Dark Lord of the Sith,
p329
aVwas released on a t-shirt
p330
aVin which she's mysteriously replaced by Luke.
p331
aVSo let's don't pat ourselves on the back too much.
p332
aVJust this week also,
p333
aVDisney announced it was no longer going to gender its Halloween costumes,
p334
aVwhich I say, "Thank you, Disney,
p335
aVexcept the only costumes you make are of male superheroes,
p336
aVso does it matter who you have wearing them?"
p337
aVJust this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,
p338
aVannounced they're going to release a line of DC superhero girls.
p339
aVAnd the funny thing is,
p340
aVthey met with girls
p341
aVand asked them what they wanted to see in dolls,
p342
aVand you can see, they have calves
p343
aVand elbows that bend so they can do superhero stuff.
p344
aVAnd please buy them.
p345
aVAnd don't just buy them for your daughters,
p346
aVbuy them for your sons.
p347
aVBecause it's important that boys play with and as female superheroes
p348
aVjust as my daughter plays with and as male superheroes.
p349
aa(lp350
VAs a matter of fact, what I would love
p351
aVis a world in which every person who goes to the store
p352
aVgoes with a little flowchart in their head
p353
aVof whether or not they should buy this toy for a boy or a girl,
p354
aVand it's a real simple flowchart because it only has one question on it.
p355
aVIt says, "Is this toy operated with your genitals?"
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VIf the answer is yes,
p360
aVthen that is not a toy for children.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd if the answer is no,
p365
aVthen it's for boys and girls.
p366
aVIt's really simple.
p367
aVBecause today is about the future of the future, and in my future,
p368
aVboys and girls are equally respected,
p369
aVequally valued, and most importantly, equally represented.
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
