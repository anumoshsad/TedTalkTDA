VI\u2019m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,
p4
aVand usually what I\u2019m talking about
p5
aVis Darwin\u2019s strange inversion of reasoning.
p6
aVNow that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,
p7
aVand this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.
p8
aa(lp9
V"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;
p10
aVso that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,
p11
aVthat, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,
p12
aVit is not requisite to know how to make it.
p13
aVThis proposition will be found on careful examination to express,
p14
aVin condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,
p15
aVand to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin\u2019s meaning;
p16
aVwho, by a strange inversion of reasoning,
p17
aVseems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified
p18
aVto take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."
p19
aa(lp20
VExactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.
p21
aVA creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:
p22
aV"Test Two:
p23
aVDo you know of any building that didn\u2019t have a builder? Yes/No.
p24
aVDo you know of any painting that didn\u2019t have a painter? Yes/No.
p25
aVDo you know of any car that didn\u2019t have a maker? Yes/No.
p26
aVIf you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."
p27
aa(lp28
VA-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.
p29
aVYou would have thought it stands to reason
p30
aVthat design requires an intelligent designer.
p31
aVBut Darwin shows that it\u2019s just false.
p32
aa(lp33
VToday, though, I\u2019m going to talk about Darwin\u2019s other strange inversion,
p34
aVwhich is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
p35
aVIt stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
p36
aVGuys go for girls like this because they are sexy.
p37
aVWe adore babies because they\u2019re so cute.
p38
aVAnd, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.
p39
aa(lp40
VThis is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.
p41
aVLet\u2019s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,
p42
aVbecause sugar is high energy, and it\u2019s just been wired up to the preferer,
p43
aVto put it very crudely, and that\u2019s why we like sugar.
p44
aVHoney is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."
p45
aVThere\u2019s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
p46
aVIf you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,
p47
aVyou wouldn\u2019t see why they tasted sweet.
p48
aVYou have to look in our brains to understand why they\u2019re sweet.
p49
aVSo if you think first there was sweetness,
p50
aVand then we evolved to like sweetness,
p51
aVyou\u2019ve got it backwards; that\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s the other way round.
p52
aVSweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd there\u2019s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.
p55
aVAnd it\u2019s a good thing that there isn\u2019t, because if there were,
p56
aVthen Mother Nature would have a problem:
p57
aVHow on earth do you get chimps to mate?
p58
aVNow you might think, ah, there\u2019s a solution: hallucinations.
p59
aVThat would be one way of doing it, but there\u2019s a quicker way.
p60
aVJust wire the chimps up to love that look,
p61
aVand apparently they do.
p62
aVThat\u2019s all there is to it.
p63
aVOver six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.
p64
aVWe became bald-bodied, oddly enough;
p65
aVfor one reason or another, they didn\u2019t.
p66
aVIf we hadn\u2019t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.
p67
aa(lp68
VOur sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.
p69
aVIt wasn\u2019t designed for chocolate cake.
p70
aVChocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
p71
aVThe term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,
p72
aVwho did his famous experiments with gulls,
p73
aVwhere he found that that orange spot on the gull\u2019s beak \u2014
p74
aVif he made a bigger, oranger spot
p75
aVthe gull chicks would peck at it even harder.
p76
aVIt was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.
p77
aVWhat we see with, say, chocolate cake
p78
aVis it\u2019s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.
p79
aVAnd there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.
p80
aVThere's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here\u2019s a pretty good example.
p83
aVIt\u2019s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.
p84
aVSo babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.
p85
aVAnd, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers
p86
aVprefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.
p87
aVSo nature works on many levels here.
p88
aVBut now, if babies didn\u2019t look the way they do \u2014 if babies looked like this,
p89
aVthat\u2019s what we would find adorable, that\u2019s what we would find \u2014
p90
aVwe would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.
p91
aVThis is the strange inversion.
p92
aa(lp93
VWell now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it\u2019s the same story, the same story.
p94
aVThis is the hard one, the one that isn\u2019t obvious. That\u2019s why I leave it to the end.
p95
aVAnd I won\u2019t be able to say too much about it.
p96
aVBut you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done \u2014
p97
aVit\u2019s dirty work, somebody\u2019s got to do it \u2014
p98
aVis so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.
p99
aVNow, I think we've found the answer \u2014 I and a few of my colleagues.
p100
aVIt\u2019s a neural system that\u2019s wired up to reward the brain
p101
aVfor doing a grubby clerical job.
p102
aVOur bumper sticker for this view is
p103
aVthat this is the joy of debugging.
p104
aVNow I\u2019m not going to have time to spell it all out,
p105
aVbut I\u2019ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.
p106
aVAnd what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe
p107
aVby switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke \u2014
p108
aVnow it\u2019s not funny ... oh, now it\u2019s funnier ...
p109
aVnow we\u2019ll turn a little bit more ... now it\u2019s not funny \u2014
p110
aVin this way, we can actually learn something
p111
aVabout the architecture of the brain,
p112
aVthe functional architecture of the brain.
p113
aa(lp114
VMatthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.
p115
aVHe\u2019s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,
p116
aVand we\u2019re putting this together into a book.
