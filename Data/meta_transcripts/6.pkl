VAt the break, I was asked by several people
p4
aVabout my comments about the aging debate.
p5
aVAnd this will be my only comment on it.
p6
aVAnd that is, I understand
p7
aVthat optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is
p11
aVhow we're about to switch from reading the genetic code
p12
aVto the first stages of beginning
p13
aVto write the code ourselves.
p14
aVIt's only 10 years ago this month
p15
aVwhen we published the first sequence
p16
aVof a free-living organism,
p17
aVthat of haemophilus influenzae.
p18
aVThat took a genome project
p19
aVfrom 13 years down to four months.
p20
aVWe can now do that same genome project
p21
aVin the order of
p22
aVtwo to eight hours.
p23
aVSo in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:
p24
aVmost human pathogens,
p25
aVa couple of plants,
p26
aVseveral insects and several mammals,
p27
aVincluding the human genome.
p28
aVGenomics at this stage of the thinking
p29
aVfrom a little over 10 years ago
p30
aVwas, by the end of this year, we might have
p31
aVbetween three and five genomes sequenced;
p32
aVit's on the order of several hundred.
p33
aVWe just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
p34
aVto sequence 130 genomes this year,
p35
aVas a side project from environmental organisms.
p36
aVSo the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut as we look, what's out there,
p39
aVwe've barely scratched the surface
p40
aVon what is available on this planet.
p41
aVMost people don't realize it, because they're invisible,
p42
aVbut microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
p43
aVwhereas all animals only make up about
p44
aVone one-thousandth of all the biomass.
p45
aVAnd maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
p46
aVbut if you ever make it to the sea,
p47
aVand you swallow a mouthful of seawater,
p48
aVkeep in mind that each milliliter
p49
aVhas about a million bacteria
p50
aVand on the order of 10 million viruses.
p51
aa(lp52
VLess than 5,000 microbial species
p53
aVhave been characterized as of two years ago,
p54
aVand so we decided to do something about it.
p55
aVAnd we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,
p56
aVwhere we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,
p57
aVtrying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
p58
aVWe started in Bermuda for our test project,
p59
aVthen moved up to Halifax,
p60
aVworking down the U.S. East Coast,
p61
aVthe Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,
p62
aVthrough to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,
p63
aVand we're in the process now of working our way
p64
aVacross the Indian Ocean.
p65
aVIt's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
p66
aVin part to help excite young people
p67
aVabout going into science.
p68
aVThe experiments are incredibly simple.
p69
aVWe just take seawater and we filter it,
p70
aVand we collect different size organisms on different filters,
p71
aVand then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
p72
aVwhere we can sequence a hundred million letters
p73
aVof the genetic code every 24 hours.
p74
aVAnd with doing this,
p75
aVwe've made some amazing discoveries.
p76
aa(lp77
VFor example, it was thought that the visual pigments
p78
aVthat are in our eyes \u2014 there was only one or two organisms
p79
aVin the environment that had these same pigments.
p80
aVIt turns out, almost every species
p81
aVin the upper parts of the ocean
p82
aVin warm parts of the world
p83
aVhave these same photoreceptors,
p84
aVand use sunlight as the source of their energy
p85
aVand communication.
p86
aVFrom one site, from one barrel of seawater,
p87
aVwe discovered 1.3 million new genes
p88
aVand as many as 50,000 new species.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe've extended this to the air
p91
aVnow with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
p92
aVWe're measuring how many viruses and bacteria
p93
aVall of us are breathing in and out every day,
p94
aVparticularly on airplanes
p95
aVor closed auditoriums.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVWe filter through some simple apparatuses;
p98
aVwe collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
p99
aVfiltering on top of a building in New York City.
p100
aVAnd we're in the process of sequencing all that
p101
aVat the present time.
p102
aa(lp103
VJust on the data collection side,
p104
aVjust where we are through the Galapagos,
p105
aVwe're finding that almost every 200 miles,
p106
aVwe see tremendous diversity
p107
aVin the samples in the ocean.
p108
aVSome of these make logical sense,
p109
aVin terms of different temperature gradients.
p110
aVSo this is a satellite photograph
p111
aVbased on temperatures \u2014 red being warm,
p112
aVblue being cold \u2014
p113
aVand we found there's a tremendous difference between
p114
aVthe warm water samples and the cold water samples,
p115
aVin terms of abundant species.
p116
aVThe other thing that surprised us quite a bit
p117
aVis these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,
p118
aVand we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
p119
aVAnd these vary tremendously from region to region.
p120
aVMaybe not surprisingly,
p121
aVin the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,
p122
aVthe photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
p123
aVWhen there's a lot of chlorophyll around,
p124
aVthey see a lot of green light.
p125
aVBut they vary even more,
p126
aVpossibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet
p127
aVin the extremes.
p128
aa(lp129
VJust to try and get an assessment
p130
aVof what our gene repertoire was,
p131
aVwe assembled all the data \u2014
p132
aVincluding all of ours thus far from the expedition,
p133
aVwhich represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet \u2014
p134
aVand it totaled around 29 million genes.
p135
aVAnd we tried to put these into gene families
p136
aVto see what these discoveries are:
p137
aVAre we just discovering new members of known families,
p138
aVor are we discovering new families?
p139
aVAnd it turns out we have about 50,000
p140
aVmajor gene families,
p141
aVbut every new sample we take in the environment
p142
aVadds in a linear fashion to these new families.
p143
aVSo we're at the earliest stages of discovery
p144
aVabout basic genes,
p145
aVcomponents and life on this planet.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhen we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,
p148
aVwe're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
p149
aVOf those roughly 29 million genes,
p150
aVwe only have around 24,000
p151
aVin our genome.
p152
aVAnd if you take all animals together,
p153
aVwe probably share less than 30,000
p154
aVand probably maybe a dozen
p155
aVor more thousand different gene families.
p156
aVI view that these genes are now
p157
aVnot only the design components of evolution.
p158
aVAnd we think in a gene-centric view \u2014
p159
aVmaybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas \u2014
p160
aVthan in a genome-centric view,
p161
aVwhich are different constructs of these gene components.
p162
aa(lp163
VSynthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,
p164
aVhas changed at sort of the same pace
p165
aVthat DNA sequencing has
p166
aVover the last decade or two,
p167
aVand is getting very rapid and very cheap.
p168
aVOur first thought about synthetic genomics came
p169
aVwhen we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
p170
aVand that from mycoplasma genitalium.
p171
aVAnd we have really nice T-shirts that say,
p172
aVyou know, "I heart my genitalium."
p173
aVThis is actually just a microorganism.
p174
aVBut it has roughly 500 genes.
p175
aVHaemophilus had 1,800 genes.
p176
aVAnd we simply asked the question,
p177
aVif one species needs 800, another 500,
p178
aVis there a smaller set of genes
p179
aVthat might comprise a minimal operating system?
p180
aa(lp181
VSo we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
p182
aVTransposons are just small pieces of DNA
p183
aVthat randomly insert in the genetic code.
p184
aVAnd if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
p185
aVSo we made a map of all the genes
p186
aVthat could take transposon insertions
p187
aVand we called those "non-essential genes."
p188
aVBut it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
p189
aVand you can only
p190
aVdefine an essential or non-essential gene
p191
aVbased on exactly what's in the environment.
p192
aVWe also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
p193
aVwith the genomes of 13 related organisms,
p194
aVand we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
p195
aVAnd we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
p196
aVcommon to all 13 organisms.
p197
aVThe pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
p198
aVone intracellular parasite;
p199
aVit expanded even more
p200
aVwhen we looked at core sets of genes
p201
aVof around 310 or so.
p202
aVSo we think that we can expand
p203
aVor contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
p204
aVto maybe 300 to 400 genes
p205
aVfrom the minimal of 500.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe only way to prove these ideas
p208
aVwas to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
p209
aVand we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
p210
aVWe found that synthesizing accurate DNA
p211
aVin large pieces was extremely difficult.
p212
aVHam Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
p213
aVdeveloped an exciting new method
p214
aVthat allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
p215
aVin only a two-week period
p216
aVthat was 100 percent accurate,
p217
aVin terms of its sequence and its biology.
p218
aVIt was a quite exciting experiment \u2014 when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
p219
aVinjected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
p220
aVthat DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
p221
aVthat turned around and then killed the bacteria.
p222
aVThis was not the first synthetic virus \u2014
p223
aVa polio virus had been made a year before \u2014
p224
aVbut it was only one ten-thousandth as active
p225
aVand it took three years to do.
p226
aVThis is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
p227
aVThis is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
p228
aVand that's the notions that we have with biology.
p229
aa(lp230
VPeople immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,
p231
aVand I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
p232
aVand a special committee the U.S. government has set up
p233
aVto review this area.
p234
aVAnd I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
p235
aVversus what happens with people's imaginations.
p236
aVBasically, any virus that's been sequenced today \u2014
p237
aVthat genome can be made.
p238
aVAnd people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
p239
aVbut the DNA from this organism is not infective.
p240
aVSo even if somebody made the smallpox genome,
p241
aVthat DNA itself would not cause infections.
p242
aVThe real concern that security departments have
p243
aVis designer viruses.
p244
aVAnd there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
p245
aVthat had major efforts
p246
aVon trying to create biological warfare agents.
p247
aVIf that research is truly discontinued,
p248
aVthere should be very little activity
p249
aVon the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
p250
aa(lp251
VI think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
p252
aVAnd possibly eukaryotic cells,
p253
aVthose that we have,
p254
aVare possible within a decade.
p255
aVSo we're now making several dozen different constructs,
p256
aVbecause we can vary the cassettes and the genes
p257
aVthat go into this artificial chromosome.
p258
aVThe key is, how do you put all of the others?
p259
aVWe start with these fragments,
p260
aVand then we have a homologous recombination system
p261
aVthat reassembles those into a chromosome.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,
p264
aVthat can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
p265
aVIt reassembles its genome after this radiation burst
p266
aVin about 12 to 24 hours,
p267
aVafter its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
p268
aVThis organism is ubiquitous on the planet,
p269
aVand exists perhaps now
p270
aVin outer space due to all our travel there.
p271
aVThis is a glass beaker after
p272
aVabout half a million rads of radiation.
p273
aVThe glass started to burn and crack,
p274
aVwhile the microbes sitting in the bottom
p275
aVjust got happier and happier.
p276
aVHere's an actual picture of what happens:
p277
aVthe top of this shows the genome
p278
aVafter 1.7 million rads of radiation.
p279
aVThe chromosome is literally blown apart.
p280
aVAnd here's that same DNA automatically reassembled
p281
aV24 hours later.
p282
aVIt's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
p283
aVand we probably have thousands,
p284
aVif not tens of thousands, of different species
p285
aVon this planet that are capable of doing that.
p286
aVAfter these genomes are synthesized,
p287
aVthe first step is just transplanting them
p288
aVinto a cell without a genome.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,
p291
aVnot only for understanding the basis of biology
p292
aVbut for hopefully environmental and society issues.
p293
aVFor example, from the third organism we sequenced,
p294
aVMethanococcus jannaschii \u2014 it lives in boiling water temperatures;
p295
aVits energy source is hydrogen
p296
aVand all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
p297
aVSo we know lots of different pathways,
p298
aVthousands of different organisms now
p299
aVthat live off of CO2,
p300
aVand can capture that back.
p301
aVSo instead of using carbon from oil
p302
aVfor synthetic processes,
p303
aVwe have the chance of using carbon
p304
aVand capturing it back from the atmosphere,
p305
aVconverting that into biopolymers
p306
aVor other products.
p307
aVWe have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
p308
aVand we use as a reducing power
p309
aVto split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
p310
aVAlso, there's numerous pathways
p311
aVthat can be engineered metabolizing methane.
p312
aVAnd DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
p313
aVto capture and convert the methane
p314
aVfrom the gas fields there into useful products.
p315
aa(lp316
VWithin a short while, I think there's going to be a new field
p317
aVcalled "Combinatorial Genomics,"
p318
aVbecause with these new synthesis capabilities,
p319
aVthese vast gene array repertoires
p320
aVand the homologous recombination,
p321
aVwe think we can design a robot to make
p322
aVmaybe a million different chromosomes a day.
p323
aVAnd therefore, as with all biology,
p324
aVyou get selection through screening,
p325
aVwhether you're screening for hydrogen production,
p326
aVor chemical production, or just viability.
p327
aVTo understand the role of these genes
p328
aVis going to be well within reach.
p329
aa(lp330
VWe're trying to modify photosynthesis
p331
aVto produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
p332
aVPhotosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,
p333
aVand we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase
p334
aVthat we think will totally change this process.
p335
aVWe're also combining cellulases,
p336
aVthe enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
p337
aVand fermentation in the same cell
p338
aVfor producing ethanol.
p339
aVPharmaceutical production is already under way
p340
aVin major laboratories
p341
aVusing microbes.
p342
aVThe chemistry from compounds in the environment
p343
aVis orders of magnitude more complex
p344
aVthan our best chemists can produce.
p345
aVI think future engineered species
p346
aVcould be the source of food,
p347
aVhopefully a source of energy,
p348
aVenvironmental remediation
p349
aVand perhaps
p350
aVreplacing the petrochemical industry.
p351
aa(lp352
VLet me just close with ethical and policy studies.
p353
aVWe delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
p354
aVuntil we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review
p355
aVas to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
p356
aVEvery major religion participated in this.
p357
aVIt was actually a very strange study,
p358
aVbecause the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
p359
aVand they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
p360
aVso it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
p361
aVwere biological warfare aspects of this,
p362
aVbut gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
p363
aVfor the reasons we were doing them.
p364
aa(lp365
VRight now the Sloan Foundation has just funded
p366
aVa multi-institutional study on this,
p367
aVto work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
p368
aVand the rules that scientific teams such as my own
p369
aVshould be using in this area,
p370
aVand we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
p371
aVThese are complex issues.
p372
aVExcept for the threat of bio-terrorism,
p373
aVthey're very simple issues in terms of,
p374
aVcan we design things to produce clean energy,
p375
aVperhaps revolutionizing
p376
aVwhat developing countries can do
p377
aVand provide through various simple processes.
