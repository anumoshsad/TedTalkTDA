VHere's a question for you:
p4
aVhow many different scents do you think you can smell,
p5
aVand maybe even identify with accuracy?
p6
aV100?
p7
aV300?
p8
aV1,000?
p9
aVOne study estimates that humans can detect up to one trillion different odors.
p10
aVA trillion.
p11
aVIt's hard to imagine,
p12
aVbut your nose has the molecular machinery to make it happen.
p13
aa(lp14
VOlfactory receptors \u2014
p15
aVtiny scent detectors \u2014
p16
aVare packed into your nose,
p17
aVeach one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor,
p18
aVor ligand,
p19
aVthat it's been assigned to detect.
p20
aVIt turns out we humans, like all vertebrates,
p21
aVhave lots of olfactory receptors.
p22
aVIn fact, more of our DNA is devoted to genes for different olfactory receptors
p23
aVthan for any other type of protein.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhy is that?
p26
aVCould olfactory receptors be doing something else
p27
aVin addition to allowing us to smell?
p28
aa(lp29
VIn 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity
p30
aVof olfactory receptors \u2014
p31
aVwork which ultimately led to a Nobel Prize.
p32
aVAt the time,
p33
aVwe all assumed that these receptors were only found in the nose.
p34
aVHowever, about a year or so later,
p35
aVa report emerged of an olfactory receptor expressed in a tissue
p36
aVother than the nose.
p37
aVAnd then another such report emerged,
p38
aVand another.
p39
aVWe now know that these receptors are found all over the body,
p40
aVincluding in some pretty unexpected places \u2014
p41
aVin muscle,
p42
aVin kidneys,
p43
aVlungs
p44
aVand blood vessels.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut what are they doing there?
p47
aVWell, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors
p48
aVin the nose \u2014
p49
aVthat's how they mediate our sense of smell.
p50
aVIt turns out they also act as sensitive chemical sensors
p51
aVin many other parts of the body.
p52
aVNow, I'm not saying that your liver can detect the aroma of your morning coffee
p53
aVas you walk into the kitchen.
p54
aVRather, after you drink your morning coffee,
p55
aVyour liver might use an olfactory receptor
p56
aVto chemically detect the change in concentration
p57
aVof a chemical floating through your bloodstream.
p58
aa(lp59
VMany cell types and tissues in the body use chemical sensors,
p60
aVor chemosensors,
p61
aVto keep track of the concentration of hormones, metabolites
p62
aVand other molecules,
p63
aVand some of these chemosensors are olfactory receptors.
p64
aVIf you are a pancreas or a kidney
p65
aVand you need a specialized chemical sensor
p66
aVthat will allow you to keep track of a specific molecule,
p67
aVwhy reinvent the wheel?
p68
aa(lp69
VOne of the first examples
p70
aVof an olfactory receptor found outside the nose
p71
aVshowed that human sperm express an olfactory receptor,
p72
aVand that sperm with this receptor will seek out the chemical
p73
aVthat the receptor responds to \u2014
p74
aVthe receptor's ligand.
p75
aVThat is, the sperm will swim toward the ligand.
p76
aVThis has intriguing implications.
p77
aVAre sperm aided in finding the egg
p78
aVby sniffing out the area with the highest ligand concentration?
p79
aa(lp80
VI like this example because it clearly demonstrates
p81
aVthat an olfactory receptor's primary job is to be a chemical sensor,
p82
aVbut depending on the context,
p83
aVit can influence how you perceive a smell,
p84
aVor in which direction sperm will swim,
p85
aVand as it turns out,
p86
aVa huge variety of other processes.
p87
aVOlfactory receptors have been implicated in muscle cell migration,
p88
aVin helping the lung to sense and respond to inhaled chemicals,
p89
aVand in wound healing.
p90
aa(lp91
VSimilarly, taste receptors once thought to be found only in the tongue,
p92
aVare now known to be expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body.
p93
aVEven more surprisingly,
p94
aVa recent study found
p95
aVthat the light receptors in our eyes also play a role in our blood vessels.
p96
aa(lp97
VIn my lab,
p98
aVwe work on trying to understand the roles of olfactory receptors and taste receptors
p99
aVin the context of the kidney.
p100
aVThe kidney is a central control center for homeostasis.
p101
aVAnd to us,
p102
aVit makes sense that a homeostatic control center would be a logical place
p103
aVto employ chemical sensors.
p104
aVWe've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors
p105
aVin the kidney,
p106
aVone of which, olfactory receptor 78,
p107
aVis known to be expressed in cells and tissues
p108
aVthat are important in the regulation of blood pressure.
p109
aVWhen this receptor is deleted in mice,
p110
aVtheir blood pressure is low.
p111
aVSurprisingly, this receptor was found to respond
p112
aVto chemicals called short-chain fatty acids
p113
aVthat are produced by the bacteria that reside in your gut \u2014
p114
aVyour gut microbiota.
p115
aVAfter being produced by your gut microbiota,
p116
aVthese chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream
p117
aVwhere they can then interact with receptors
p118
aVlike olfactory receptor 78,
p119
aVmeaning that the changes in metabolism of your gut microbiota
p120
aVmay influence your blood pressure.
p121
aa(lp122
VAlthough we've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors
p123
aVin the kidney,
p124
aVwe've only just begun to tease out their different functions
p125
aVand to figure out which chemicals each of them responds to.
p126
aVSimilar investigations lie ahead for many other organs and tissues \u2014
p127
aVonly a small minority of receptors has been studied to date.
p128
aVThis is exciting stuff.
p129
aVIt's revolutionizing our understanding of the scope of influence
p130
aVfor one of the five senses.
p131
aVAnd it has the potential to change our understanding
p132
aVof some aspects of human physiology.
p133
aVIt's still early,
p134
aVbut I think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following.
