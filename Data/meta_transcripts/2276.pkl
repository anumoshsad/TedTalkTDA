VIt was November 1, 2002,
p4
aVmy first day as a principal,
p5
aVbut hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia.
p6
aa(lp7
VI graduated from Philadelphia public schools,
p8
aVand I went on to teach special education for 20 years
p9
aVin a low-income, low-performing school
p10
aVin North Philadelphia,
p11
aVwhere crime is rampant
p12
aVand deep poverty is among the highest in the nation.
p13
aa(lp14
VShortly after I walked into my new school,
p15
aVa huge fight broke out among the girls.
p16
aVAfter things were quickly under control,
p17
aVI immediately called a meeting
p18
aVin the school's auditorium
p19
aVto introduce myself as the school's new principal.
p20
aV(Applause)
p21
aa(lp22
VI walked in angry,
p23
aVa little nervous \u2014
p24
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p25
aVbut I was determined
p26
aVto set the tone for my new students.
p27
aVI started listing as forcefully as I could
p28
aVmy expectations for their behavior
p29
aVand my expectations for what they would learn in school.
p30
aVWhen, all of a sudden,
p31
aVa girl way in the back of the auditorium,
p32
aVshe stood up
p33
aVand she said, "Miss!
p34
aVMiss!"
p35
aVWhen our eyes locked, she said,
p36
aV"Why do you keep calling this a school?
p37
aVThis is not a school."
p38
aa(lp39
VIn one outburst,
p40
aVAshley had expressed what I felt
p41
aVand never quite was able to articulate
p42
aVabout my own experience when I attended a low-performing school
p43
aVin the same neighborhood, many, many, many years earlier.
p44
aVThat school was definitely not a school.
p45
aa(lp46
VFast forwarding a decade later to 2012,
p47
aVI was entering my third low-performing school as principal.
p48
aVI was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years.
p49
aVIt was labeled "low-performing and persistently dangerous"
p50
aVdue to its low test scores
p51
aVand high number of weapons,
p52
aVdrugs, assaults and arrests.
p53
aVShortly as I approached the door of my new school
p54
aVand attempted to enter,
p55
aVand found the door locked with chains,
p56
aVI could hear Ashley's voice in my ears
p57
aVgoing, "Miss! Miss!
p58
aVThis is not a school."
p59
aVThe halls were dim and dark from poor lighting.
p60
aVThere were tons of piles of broken old furniture
p61
aVand desks in the classrooms,
p62
aVand there were thousands of unused materials and resources.
p63
aVThis was not a school.
p64
aVAs the year progressed,
p65
aVI noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty.
p66
aVThe students were just scared:
p67
aVscared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen;
p68
aVscared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food.
p69
aVThey were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying.
p70
aVThis was not a school.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd then, there were the teachers,
p73
aVwho were incredibly afraid for their own safety,
p74
aVso they had low expectations for the students and themselves,
p75
aVand they were totally unaware of their role
p76
aVin the destruction of the school's culture.
p77
aVThis was the most troubling of all.
p78
aVYou see, Ashley was right,
p79
aVand not just about her school.
p80
aVFor far too many schools,
p81
aVfor kids who live in poverty,
p82
aVtheir schools are really not schools at all.
p83
aVBut this can change.
p84
aVLet me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School.
p85
aVAnybody who's ever worked with me will tell you
p86
aVI am known for my slogans.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVSo today, I am going to use three
p89
aVthat have been paramount in our quest for change.
p90
aa(lp91
VMy first slogan is:
p92
aVif you're going to lead, lead.
p93
aVI always believed
p94
aVthat what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school
p95
aVis up to the principal.
p96
aVI am the principal,
p97
aVand having that title required me to lead.
p98
aVI was not going to stay in my office,
p99
aVI was not going to delegate my work,
p100
aVand I was not going to be afraid to address anything
p101
aVthat was not good for children,
p102
aVwhether that made me liked or not.
p103
aVI am a leader,
p104
aVso I know I cannot do anything alone.
p105
aVSo, I assembled a top-notch leadership team
p106
aVwho believed in the possibility of all the children,
p107
aVand together, we tackled the small things,
p108
aVlike resetting every single locker combination by hand
p109
aVso that every student could have a secure locker.
p110
aVWe decorated every bulletin board in that building
p111
aVwith bright, colorful, and positive messages.
p112
aVWe took the chains off the front doors of the school.
p113
aVWe got the lightbulbs replaced,
p114
aVand we cleaned every classroom to its core,
p115
aVrecycling every, every textbook that was not needed,
p116
aVand discarded thousands of old materials and furniture.
p117
aVWe used two dumpsters per day.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd, of course, of course,
p120
aVwe tackled the big stuff,
p121
aVlike rehauling the entire school budget
p122
aVso that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff.
p123
aVWe rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch
p124
aVto add a variety of start and end times,
p125
aVremediation, honors courses,
p126
aVextracurricular activities, and counseling,
p127
aVall during the school day.
p128
aVAll during the school day.
p129
aVWe created a deployment plan
p130
aVthat specified where every single support person and police officer would be
p131
aVevery minute of the day,
p132
aVand we monitored at every second of the day,
p133
aVand, our best invention ever,
p134
aVwe devised a schoolwide discipline program
p135
aVtitled "Non-negotiables."
p136
aVIt was a behavior system \u2014
p137
aVdesigned to promote positive behavior at all times.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe results?
p140
aVStrawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List
p141
aVour first year after being \u2014
p142
aV(Applause) \u2014
p143
aVafter being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years.
p144
aVLeaders make the impossible possible.
p145
aa(lp146
VThat brings me to my second slogan:
p147
aVSo what? Now what?
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VWhen we looked at the data,
p152
aVand we met with the staff,
p153
aVthere were many excuses
p154
aVfor why Strawberry Mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous.
p155
aVThey said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis,
p156
aV100 percent of them live in poverty,
p157
aVonly one percent of the parents participate,
p158
aVmany of the children
p159
aVcome from incarceration and single-parent homes,
p160
aV39 percent of the students have special needs,
p161
aVand the state data revealed
p162
aVthat six percent of the students were proficient in algebra,
p163
aVand 10 were proficient in literature.
p164
aa(lp165
VAfter they got through telling us all the stories
p166
aVof how awful the conditions and the children were,
p167
aVI looked at them,
p168
aVand I said, "So what. Now what?
p169
aVWhat are we gonna do about it?"
p170
aV(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VEliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility.
p173
aVWe addressed every one of those excuses
p174
aVthrough a mandatory professional development,
p175
aVpaving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning.
p176
aVAfter many observations,
p177
aVwhat we determined was that teachers knew what to teach
p178
aVbut they did not know how to teach
p179
aVso many children with so many vast abilities.
p180
aVSo, we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction
p181
aVthat focused on small group instruction,
p182
aVmaking it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met
p183
aVin the classroom.
p184
aa(lp185
VThe results?
p186
aVAfter one year, state data revealed
p187
aVthat our scores have grown by 171 percent in Algebra
p188
aVand 107 percent in literature.
p189
aV(Applause)
p190
aVWe have a very long way to go,
p191
aVa very long way to go,
p192
aVbut we now approach every obstacle with a "So What. Now What?" attitude.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd that brings me to my third and final slogan.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVIf nobody told you they loved you today,
p197
aVyou remember I do, and I always will.
p198
aa(lp199
VMy students have problems:
p200
aVsocial, emotional and economic problems
p201
aVyou could never imagine.
p202
aVSome of them are parents themselves,
p203
aVand some are completely alone.
p204
aVIf someone asked me my real secret
p205
aVfor how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward,
p206
aVI would have to say that I love my students
p207
aVand I believe in their possibilities
p208
aVunconditionally.
p209
aVWhen I look at them,
p210
aVI can only see what they can become,
p211
aVand that is because I am one of them.
p212
aVI grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.
p213
aVI know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school.
p214
aVI know what it feels like to wonder
p215
aVif there's ever going to be any way out of poverty.
p216
aVBut because of my amazing mother,
p217
aVI got the ability to dream
p218
aVdespite the poverty that surrounded me.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo \u2014
p221
aV(Applause) \u2014
p222
aVif I'm going to push my students
p223
aVtoward their dream and their purpose in life,
p224
aVI've got to get to know who they are.
p225
aVSo I have to spend time with them,
p226
aVso I manage the lunchroom every day.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVAnd while I'm there,
p229
aVI talk to them about deeply personal things,
p230
aVand when it's their birthday,
p231
aVI sing "Happy Birthday"
p232
aVeven though I cannot sing at all.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVI often ask them,
p235
aV"Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all?"
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVAnd they respond by saying,
p238
aV"Because we like feeling special."
p239
aa(lp240
VWe hold monthly town hall meetings
p241
aVto listen to their concerns,
p242
aVto find out what is on their minds.
p243
aVThey ask us questions like, "Why do we have to follow rules?"
p244
aV"Why are there so many consequences?"
p245
aV"Why can't we just do what we want to do?"
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVThey ask, and I answer each question honestly,
p248
aVand this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions.
p249
aVEvery moment is a teachable moment.
p250
aa(lp251
VMy reward,
p252
aVmy reward
p253
aVfor being non-negotiable in my rules and consequences
p254
aVis their earned respect.
p255
aVI insist on it,
p256
aVand because of this, we can accomplish things together.
p257
aVThey are clear about my expectations for them,
p258
aVand I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system.
p259
aVI remind them \u2014
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVI remind them of those core values
p262
aVof focus, tradition, excellence,
p263
aVintegrity and perseverance,
p264
aVand I remind them every day
p265
aVhow education can truly change their lives.
p266
aVAnd I end every announcement the same:
p267
aV"If nobody told you they loved you today,
p268
aVyou remember I do,
p269
aVand I always will."
p270
aa(lp271
VAshley's words
p272
aVof "Miss, Miss,
p273
aVthis is not a school,"
p274
aVis forever etched in my mind.
p275
aVIf we are truly going to make real progress
p276
aVin addressing poverty,
p277
aVthen we have to make sure
p278
aVthat every school that serves children in poverty
p279
aVis a real school,
p280
aVa school, a school \u2014
p281
aV(Applause) \u2014
p282
aVa school that provides them with knowledge
p283
aVand mental training to navigate the world around them.
p284
aa(lp285
VI do not know all the answers,
p286
aVbut what I do know is for those of us who are privileged
p287
aVand have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty,
p288
aVwe must truly lead,
p289
aVand when we are faced with unbelievable challenges,
p290
aVwe must stop and ask ourselves, "So what. Now what?
p291
aVWhat are we going to do about it?"
p292
aVAnd as we lead,
p293
aVwe must never forget
p294
aVthat every single one of our students
p295
aVis just a child,
p296
aVoften scared by what the world tells them they should be,
p297
aVand no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be,
p298
aVwe should always provide them with hope,
p299
aVour undivided attention,
p300
aVunwavering belief in their potential,
p301
aVconsistent expectations,
p302
aVand we must tell them often,
p303
aVif nobody told them they loved them today,
p304
aVremember we do, and we always will.
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you.
