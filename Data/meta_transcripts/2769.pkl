VI come to you today to speak of liars,
p4
aVlawsuits
p5
aVand laughter.
p6
aVThe first time I heard about Holocaust denial,
p7
aVI laughed.
p8
aVHolocaust denial?
p9
aVThe Holocaust which has the dubious distinction
p10
aVof being the best-documented genocide in the world?
p11
aVWho could believe it didn't happen?
p12
aa(lp13
VThink about it.
p14
aVFor deniers to be right,
p15
aVwho would have to be wrong?
p16
aVWell, first of all, the victims \u2014
p17
aVthe survivors who have told us their harrowing stories.
p18
aVWho else would have to be wrong?
p19
aVThe bystanders.
p20
aVThe people who lived in the myriads of towns and villages and cities
p21
aVon the Eastern front,
p22
aVwho watched their neighbors be rounded up \u2014
p23
aVmen, women, children, young, old \u2014
p24
aVand be marched to the outskirts of the town
p25
aVto be shot and left dead in ditches.
p26
aVOr the Poles,
p27
aVwho lived in towns and villages around the death camps,
p28
aVwho watched day after day
p29
aVas the trains went in filled with people
p30
aVand came out empty.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut above all, who would have to be wrong?
p33
aVThe perpetrators.
p34
aVThe people who say, "We did it.
p35
aVI did it."
p36
aVNow, maybe they add a caveat.
p37
aVThey say, "I didn't have a choice; I was forced to do it."
p38
aVBut nonetheless, they say, "I did it."
p39
aVThink about it.
p40
aVIn not one war crimes trial since the end of World War II
p41
aVhas a perpetrator of any nationality ever said, "It didn't happen."
p42
aVAgain, they may have said, "I was forced," but never that it didn't happen.
p43
aVHaving thought that through,
p44
aVI decided denial was not going to be on my agenda;
p45
aVI had bigger things to worry about, to write about, to research,
p46
aVand I moved on.
p47
aa(lp48
VFast-forward a little over a decade,
p49
aVand two senior scholars \u2014
p50
aVtwo of the most prominent historians of the Holocaust \u2014
p51
aVapproached me and said,
p52
aV"Deborah, let's have coffee.
p53
aVWe have a research idea that we think is perfect for you."
p54
aVIntrigued and flattered that they came to me with an idea
p55
aVand thought me worthy of it,
p56
aVI asked, "What is it?"
p57
aVAnd they said, "Holocaust denial."
p58
aVAnd for the second time, I laughed.
p59
aVHolocaust denial?
p60
aVThe Flat Earth folks?
p61
aVThe Elvis-is-alive people?
p62
aVI should study them?
p63
aVAnd these two guys said,
p64
aV"Yeah, we're intrigued.
p65
aVWhat are they about?
p66
aVWhat's their objective?
p67
aVHow do they manage to get people to believe what they say?"
p68
aa(lp69
VSo thinking, if they thought it was worthwhile,
p70
aVI would take a momentary diversion \u2014
p71
aVmaybe a year, maybe two, three, maybe even four \u2014
p72
aVin academic terms, that's momentary.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VWe work very slowly.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd I would look at them.
p81
aVSo I did.
p82
aVI did my research, and I came up with a number of things,
p83
aVtwo of which I'd like to share with you today.
p84
aa(lp85
VOne:
p86
aVdeniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.
p87
aVThey are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis \u2014
p88
aVyou can decide whether you want to put a "neo" there or not.
p89
aVBut when I looked at them,
p90
aVI didn't see any SS-like uniforms,
p91
aVswastika-like symbols on the wall,
p92
aVSieg Heil salutes \u2014
p93
aVnone of that.
p94
aVWhat I found instead
p95
aVwere people parading as respectable academics.
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat did they have?
p98
aVThey had an institute.
p99
aVAn "Institute for Historical Review."
p100
aVThey had a journal \u2014 a slick journal \u2014
p101
aVa "Journal of Historical Review."
p102
aVOne filled with papers \u2014
p103
aVfootnote-laden papers.
p104
aVAnd they had a new name.
p105
aVNot neo-Nazis,
p106
aVnot anti-Semites \u2014
p107
aVrevisionists.
p108
aVThey said, "We are revisionists.
p109
aVWe are out to do one thing:
p110
aVto revise mistakes in history."
p111
aVBut all you had to do was go one inch below the surface,
p112
aVand what did you find there?
p113
aVThe same adulation of Hitler,
p114
aVpraise of the Third Reich,
p115
aVanti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.
p116
aVThis is what intrigued me.
p117
aVIt was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice, parading as rational discourse.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe other thing I found \u2014
p120
aVmany of us have been taught to think there are facts and there are opinions \u2014
p121
aVafter studying deniers,
p122
aVI think differently.
p123
aVThere are facts,
p124
aVthere are opinions,
p125
aVand there are lies.
p126
aVAnd what deniers want to do is take their lies,
p127
aVdress them up as opinions \u2014
p128
aVmaybe edgy opinions,
p129
aVmaybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions \u2014
p130
aVbut then if they're opinions,
p131
aVthey should be part of the conversation.
p132
aVAnd then they encroach on the facts.
p133
aa(lp134
VI published my work \u2014
p135
aVthe book was published,
p136
aV"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,"
p137
aVit came out in many different countries,
p138
aVincluding here in Penguin UK,
p139
aVand I was done with those folks and ready to move on.
p140
aVThen came the letter from Penguin UK.
p141
aVAnd for the third time, I laughed ...
p142
aVmistakenly.
p143
aVI opened the letter,
p144
aVand it informed me that David Irving was bringing a libel suit against me
p145
aVin the United Kingdom
p146
aVfor calling him a Holocaust denier.
p147
aa(lp148
VDavid Irving suing me?
p149
aVWho was David Irving?
p150
aVDavid Irving was a writer of historical works,
p151
aVmost of them about World War II,
p152
aVand virtually all of those works took the position
p153
aVthat the Nazis were really not so bad,
p154
aVand the Allies were really not so good.
p155
aVAnd the Jews, whatever happened to them,
p156
aVthey sort of deserved it.
p157
aVHe knew the documents,
p158
aVhe knew the facts,
p159
aVbut he somehow twisted them to get this opinion.
p160
aVHe hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,
p161
aVbut in the late '80s,
p162
aVhe embraced it with great vigor.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe reason I laughed also was this was a man
p165
aVwho not only was a Holocaust denier,
p166
aVbut seemed quite proud of it.
p167
aVHere was a man \u2014 and I quote \u2014
p168
aVwho said, "I'm going to sink the battleship Auschwitz."
p169
aVHere was a man
p170
aVwho pointed to the number tattooed on a survivor's arm and said,
p171
aV"How much money have you made
p172
aVfrom having that number tattooed on your arm?"
p173
aVHere was a man who said,
p174
aV"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car
p175
aVat Chappaquiddick
p176
aVthan died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."
p177
aVThat's an American reference, but you can look it up.
p178
aVThis was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent
p179
aVabout being a Holocaust denier.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, lots of my academic colleagues counseled me \u2014
p182
aV"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it."
p183
aVWhen I explained you can't just ignore a libel suit,
p184
aVthey said, "Who's going to believe him anyway?"
p185
aVBut here was the problem:
p186
aVBritish law put the onus, put the burden of proof on me
p187
aVto prove the truth of what I said,
p188
aVin contrast to as it would have been in the United States
p189
aVand in many other countries:
p190
aVon him to prove the falsehood.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhat did that mean?
p193
aVThat meant if I didn't fight,
p194
aVhe would win by default.
p195
aVAnd if he won by default,
p196
aVhe could then legitimately say,
p197
aV"My David Irving version of the Holocaust is a legitimate version.
p198
aVDeborah Lipstadt was found to have libeled me
p199
aVwhen she called me a Holocaust denier.
p200
aVIpso facto, I, David Irving, am not a Holocaust denier."
p201
aVAnd what is that version?
p202
aVThere was no plan to murder the Jews,
p203
aVthere were no gas chambers,
p204
aVthere were no mass shootings,
p205
aVHitler had nothing to do with any suffering that went on,
p206
aVand the Jews have made this all up
p207
aVto get money from Germany
p208
aVand to get a state,
p209
aVand they've done it with the aid and abettance of the Allies \u2014
p210
aVthey've planted the documents and planted the evidence.
p211
aa(lp212
VI couldn't let that stand
p213
aVand ever face a survivor
p214
aVor a child of survivors.
p215
aVI couldn't let that stand
p216
aVand consider myself a responsible historian.
p217
aVSo we fought.
p218
aVAnd for those of you who haven't seen "Denial,"
p219
aVspoiler alert:
p220
aVwe won.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
V(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VThe judge found David Irving
p227
aVto be a liar,
p228
aVa racist,
p229
aVan anti-Semite.
p230
aVHis view of history was tendentious,
p231
aVhe lied, he distorted \u2014
p232
aVand most importantly,
p233
aVhe did it deliberately.
p234
aVWe showed a pattern, in over 25 different major instances.
p235
aVNot small things \u2014 many of us in this audience write books,
p236
aVare writing books;
p237
aVwe always make mistakes, that's why we're glad to have second editions:
p238
aVcorrect the mistakes.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VBut these always moved in the same direction:
p243
aVblame the Jews,
p244
aVexonerate the Nazis.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut how did we win?
p247
aVWhat we did is follow his footnotes back to his sources.
p248
aVAnd what did we find?
p249
aVNot in most cases,
p250
aVand not in the preponderance of cases,
p251
aVbut in every single instance where he made some reference to the Holocaust,
p252
aVthat his supposed evidence was distorted,
p253
aVhalf-truth,
p254
aVdate-changed,
p255
aVsequence-changed,
p256
aVsomeone put at a meeting who wasn't there.
p257
aVIn other words, he didn't have the evidence.
p258
aVHis evidence didn't prove it.
p259
aVWe didn't prove what happened.
p260
aVWe proved that what he said happened \u2014
p261
aVand by extension, all deniers, because he either quotes them
p262
aVor they get their arguments from him \u2014
p263
aVis not true.
p264
aVWhat they claim \u2014
p265
aVthey don't have the evidence to prove it.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo why is my story more than just the story
p268
aVof a quirky, long, six-year, difficult lawsuit,
p269
aVan American professor being dragged into a courtroom
p270
aVby a man that the court declared in its judgment
p271
aVwas a neo-Nazi polemicist?
p272
aVWhat message does it have?
p273
aVI think in the context of the question of truth,
p274
aVit has a very significant message.
p275
aVBecause today,
p276
aVas we well know,
p277
aVtruth and facts are under assault.
p278
aVSocial media, for all the gifts it has given us,
p279
aVhas also allowed the difference between facts \u2014 established facts \u2014
p280
aVand lies
p281
aVto be flattened.
p282
aa(lp283
VThird of all:
p284
aVextremism.
p285
aVYou may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,
p286
aVyou may not see burning crosses,
p287
aVyou may not even hear outright white supremacist language.
p288
aVIt may go by names: "alt-right," "National Front" \u2014 pick your names.
p289
aVBut underneath, it's that same extremism that I found in Holocaust denial
p290
aVparading as rational discourse.
p291
aa(lp292
VWe live in an age where truth is on the defensive.
p293
aVI'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.
p294
aVA quiz show recently appeared in "The New Yorker"
p295
aVwhere the host of the quiz show is saying to one of the contestants,
p296
aV"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.
p297
aVBut your opponent yelled more loudly than you did,
p298
aVso he gets the point."
p299
aa(lp300
VWhat can we do?
p301
aVFirst of all,
p302
aVwe cannot be beguiled by rational appearances.
p303
aVWe've got to look underneath,
p304
aVand we will find there the extremism.
p305
aVSecond of all,
p306
aVwe must understand that truth is not relative.
p307
aVNumber three,
p308
aVwe must go on the offensive,
p309
aVnot the defensive.
p310
aVWhen someone makes an outrageous claim,
p311
aVeven though they may hold one of the highest offices in the land,
p312
aVif not the world \u2014
p313
aVwe must say to them,
p314
aV"Where's the proof?
p315
aVWhere's the evidence?"
p316
aVWe must hold their feet to the fire.
p317
aVWe must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd as I said earlier, truth is not relative.
p320
aVMany of us have grown up in the world of the academy
p321
aVand enlightened liberal thought,
p322
aVwhere we're taught everything is open to debate.
p323
aVBut that's not the case.
p324
aVThere are certain things that are true.
p325
aVThere are indisputable facts \u2014
p326
aVobjective truths.
p327
aVGalileo taught it to us centuries ago.
p328
aVEven after being forced to recant by the Vatican
p329
aVthat the Earth moved around the Sun,
p330
aVhe came out,
p331
aVand what is he reported to have said?
p332
aV"And yet, it still moves."
p333
aa(lp334
VThe Earth is not flat.
p335
aVThe climate is changing.
p336
aVElvis is not alive.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd most importantly,
p343
aVtruth and fact are under assault.
p344
aVThe job ahead of us,
p345
aVthe task ahead of us,
p346
aVthe challenge ahead of us
p347
aVis great.
p348
aVThe time to fight is short.
p349
aVWe must act now.
p350
aVLater will be too late.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you very much.
