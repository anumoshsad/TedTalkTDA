VI'm going to talk a little bit about where technology's going.
p4
aVAnd often technology comes to us,
p5
aVwe're surprised by what it brings.
p6
aVBut there's actually a large aspect of technology
p7
aVthat's much more predictable,
p8
aVand that's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings,
p9
aVthey have urgencies,
p10
aVthey have tendencies.
p11
aVAnd those tendencies are derived from the very nature of the physics,
p12
aVchemistry of wires and switches and electrons,
p13
aVand they will make reoccurring patterns again and again.
p14
aVAnd so those patterns produce these tendencies, these leanings.
p15
aa(lp16
VYou can almost think of it as sort of like gravity.
p17
aVImagine raindrops falling into a valley.
p18
aVThe actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley
p19
aVis unpredictable.
p20
aVWe cannot see where it's going,
p21
aVbut the general direction is very inevitable:
p22
aVit's downward.
p23
aVAnd so these baked-in tendencies and urgencies
p24
aVin technological systems
p25
aVgive us a sense of where things are going at the large form.
p26
aVSo in a large sense,
p27
aVI would say that telephones were inevitable,
p28
aVbut the iPhone was not.
p29
aVThe Internet was inevitable,
p30
aVbut Twitter was not.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo we have many ongoing tendencies right now,
p33
aVand I think one of the chief among them
p34
aVis this tendency to make things smarter and smarter.
p35
aVI call it cognifying \u2014 cognification \u2014
p36
aValso known as artificial intelligence, or AI.
p37
aVAnd I think that's going to be one of the most influential developments
p38
aVand trends and directions and drives in our society in the next 20 years.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, of course, it's already here.
p41
aVWe already have AI,
p42
aVand often it works in the background,
p43
aVin the back offices of hospitals,
p44
aVwhere it's used to diagnose X-rays better than a human doctor.
p45
aVIt's in legal offices,
p46
aVwhere it's used to go through legal evidence
p47
aVbetter than a human paralawyer.
p48
aVIt's used to fly the plane that you came here with.
p49
aVHuman pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes,
p50
aVthe rest of the time the AI was driving.
p51
aVAnd of course, in Netflix and Amazon,
p52
aVit's in the background, making those recommendations.
p53
aVThat's what we have today.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd we have an example, of course, in a more front-facing aspect of it,
p56
aVwith the win of the AlphaGo, who beat the world's greatest Go champion.
p57
aVBut it's more than that.
p58
aVIf you play a video game, you're playing against an AI.
p59
aVBut recently, Google taught their AI
p60
aVto actually learn how to play video games.
p61
aVAgain, teaching video games was already done,
p62
aVbut learning how to play a video game is another step.
p63
aVThat's artificial smartness.
p64
aVWhat we're doing is taking this artificial smartness
p65
aVand we're making it smarter and smarter.
p66
aa(lp67
VThere are three aspects to this general trend
p68
aVthat I think are underappreciated;
p69
aVI think we would understand AI a lot better
p70
aVif we understood these three things.
p71
aVI think these things also would help us embrace AI,
p72
aVbecause it's only by embracing it that we actually can steer it.
p73
aVWe can actually steer the specifics by embracing the larger trend.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo let me talk about those three different aspects.
p76
aVThe first one is: our own intelligence has a very poor understanding
p77
aVof what intelligence is.
p78
aVWe tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension,
p79
aVthat it's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder.
p80
aVIt starts like with IQ measurement.
p81
aVIt starts with maybe a simple low IQ in a rat or mouse,
p82
aVand maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,
p83
aVand then maybe there's more in a stupid person,
p84
aVand then maybe an average person like myself,
p85
aVand then maybe a genius.
p86
aVAnd this single IQ intelligence is getting greater and greater.
p87
aVThat's completely wrong.
p88
aVThat's not what intelligence is \u2014 not what human intelligence is, anyway.
p89
aVIt's much more like a symphony of different notes,
p90
aVand each of these notes is played on a different instrument of cognition.
p91
aa(lp92
VThere are many types of intelligences in our own minds.
p93
aVWe have deductive reasoning,
p94
aVwe have emotional intelligence,
p95
aVwe have spatial intelligence;
p96
aVwe have maybe 100 different types that are all grouped together,
p97
aVand they vary in different strengths with different people.
p98
aVAnd of course, if we go to animals, they also have another basket \u2014
p99
aVanother symphony of different kinds of intelligences,
p100
aVand sometimes those same instruments are the same that we have.
p101
aVThey can think in the same way, but they may have a different arrangement,
p102
aVand maybe they're higher in some cases than humans,
p103
aVlike long-term memory in a squirrel is actually phenomenal,
p104
aVso it can remember where it buried its nuts.
p105
aVBut in other cases they may be lower.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhen we go to make machines,
p108
aVwe're going to engineer them in the same way,
p109
aVwhere we'll make some of those types of smartness much greater than ours,
p110
aVand many of them won't be anywhere near ours,
p111
aVbecause they're not needed.
p112
aVSo we're going to take these things,
p113
aVthese artificial clusters,
p114
aVand we'll be adding more varieties of artificial cognition to our AIs.
p115
aVWe're going to make them very, very specific.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic already;
p118
aVyour GPS is smarter than you are in spatial navigation;
p119
aVGoogle, Bing, are smarter than you are in long-term memory.
p120
aVAnd we're going to take, again, these kinds of different types of thinking
p121
aVand we'll put them into, like, a car.
p122
aVThe reason why we want to put them in a car so the car drives,
p123
aVis because it's not driving like a human.
p124
aVIt's not thinking like us.
p125
aVThat's the whole feature of it.
p126
aVIt's not being distracted,
p127
aVit's not worrying about whether it left the stove on,
p128
aVor whether it should have majored in finance.
p129
aVIt's just driving.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VJust driving, OK?
p134
aVAnd we actually might even come to advertise these
p135
aVas "consciousness-free."
p136
aVThey're without consciousness,
p137
aVthey're not concerned about those things,
p138
aVthey're not distracted.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo in general, what we're trying to do
p141
aVis make as many different types of thinking as we can.
p142
aVWe're going to populate the space
p143
aVof all the different possible types, or species, of thinking.
p144
aVAnd there actually may be some problems
p145
aVthat are so difficult in business and science
p146
aVthat our own type of human thinking may not be able to solve them alone.
p147
aVWe may need a two-step program,
p148
aVwhich is to invent new kinds of thinking
p149
aVthat we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems,
p150
aVsay, like dark energy or quantum gravity.
p151
aa(lp152
VWhat we're doing is making alien intelligences.
p153
aVYou might even think of this as, sort of, artificial aliens
p154
aVin some senses.
p155
aVAnd they're going to help us think different,
p156
aVbecause thinking different is the engine of creation
p157
aVand wealth and new economy.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe second aspect of this is that we are going to use AI
p160
aVto basically make a second Industrial Revolution.
p161
aVThe first Industrial Revolution was based on the fact
p162
aVthat we invented something I would call artificial power.
p163
aVPrevious to that,
p164
aVduring the Agricultural Revolution,
p165
aVeverything that was made had to be made with human muscle
p166
aVor animal power.
p167
aVThat was the only way to get anything done.
p168
aVThe great innovation during the Industrial Revolution was,
p169
aVwe harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,
p170
aVto make this artificial power that we could use
p171
aVto do anything we wanted to do.
p172
aVSo today when you drive down the highway,
p173
aVyou are, with a flick of the switch, commanding 250 horses \u2014
p174
aV250 horsepower \u2014
p175
aVwhich we can use to build skyscrapers, to build cities, to build roads,
p176
aVto make factories that would churn out lines of chairs or refrigerators
p177
aVway beyond our own power.
p178
aVAnd that artificial power can also be distributed on wires on a grid
p179
aVto every home, factory, farmstead,
p180
aVand anybody could buy that artificial power,
p181
aVjust by plugging something in.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo this was a source of innovation as well,
p184
aVbecause a farmer could take a manual hand pump,
p185
aVand they could add this artificial power, this electricity,
p186
aVand he'd have an electric pump.
p187
aVAnd you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times,
p188
aVand that formula was what brought us the Industrial Revolution.
p189
aVAll the things that we see, all this progress that we now enjoy,
p190
aVhas come from the fact that we've done that.
p191
aa(lp192
VWe're going to do the same thing now with AI.
p193
aVWe're going to distribute that on a grid,
p194
aVand now you can take that electric pump.
p195
aVYou can add some artificial intelligence,
p196
aVand now you have a smart pump.
p197
aVAnd that, multiplied by a million times,
p198
aVis going to be this second Industrial Revolution.
p199
aVSo now the car is going down the highway,
p200
aVit's 250 horsepower, but in addition, it's 250 minds.
p201
aVThat's the auto-driven car.
p202
aVIt's like a new commodity;
p203
aVit's a new utility.
p204
aVThe AI is going to flow across the grid \u2014 the cloud \u2014
p205
aVin the same way electricity did.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo everything that we had electrified,
p208
aVwe're now going to cognify.
p209
aVAnd I would suggest, then,
p210
aVthat the formula for the next 10,000 start-ups
p211
aVis very, very simple,
p212
aVwhich is to take x and add AI.
p213
aVThat is the formula, that's what we're going to be doing.
p214
aVAnd that is the way in which we're going to make
p215
aVthis second Industrial Revolution.
p216
aVAnd by the way \u2014 right now, this minute,
p217
aVyou can log on to Google
p218
aVand you can purchase AI for six cents, 100 hits.
p219
aVThat's available right now.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo the third aspect of this
p222
aVis that when we take this AI and embody it,
p223
aVwe get robots.
p224
aVAnd robots are going to be bots,
p225
aVthey're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done.
p226
aVA job is just a bunch of tasks,
p227
aVso they're going to redefine our jobs
p228
aVbecause they're going to do some of those tasks.
p229
aVBut they're also going to create whole new categories,
p230
aVa whole new slew of tasks
p231
aVthat we didn't know we wanted to do before.
p232
aVThey're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs,
p233
aVnew kinds of tasks that we want done,
p234
aVjust as automation made up a whole bunch of new things
p235
aVthat we didn't know we needed before,
p236
aVand now we can't live without them.
p237
aVSo they're going to produce even more jobs than they take away,
p238
aVbut it's important that a lot of the tasks that we're going to give them
p239
aVare tasks that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity.
p240
aVIf you can specify a task,
p241
aVeither manual or conceptual,
p242
aVthat can be specified in terms of efficiency or productivity,
p243
aVthat goes to the bots.
p244
aVProductivity is for robots.
p245
aVWhat we're really good at is basically wasting time.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VWe're really good at things that are inefficient.
p250
aVScience is inherently inefficient.
p251
aVIt runs on that fact that you have one failure after another.
p252
aVIt runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don't work,
p253
aVotherwise you're not learning.
p254
aVIt runs on the fact
p255
aVthat there is not a lot of efficiency in it.
p256
aVInnovation by definition is inefficient,
p257
aVbecause you make prototypes,
p258
aVbecause you try stuff that fails, that doesn't work.
p259
aVExploration is inherently inefficiency.
p260
aVArt is not efficient.
p261
aVHuman relationships are not efficient.
p262
aVThese are all the kinds of things we're going to gravitate to,
p263
aVbecause they're not efficient.
p264
aVEfficiency is for robots.
p265
aVWe're also going to learn that we're going to work with these AIs
p266
aVbecause they think differently than us.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhen Deep Blue beat the world's best chess champion,
p269
aVpeople thought it was the end of chess.
p270
aVBut actually, it turns out that today, the best chess champion in the world
p271
aVis not an AI.
p272
aVAnd it's not a human.
p273
aVIt's the team of a human and an AI.
p274
aVThe best medical diagnostician is not a doctor, it's not an AI,
p275
aVit's the team.
p276
aVWe're going to be working with these AIs,
p277
aVand I think you'll be paid in the future
p278
aVby how well you work with these bots.
p279
aVSo that's the third thing, is that they're different,
p280
aVthey're utility
p281
aVand they are going to be something we work with rather than against.
p282
aVWe're working with these rather than against them.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, the future:
p285
aVWhere does that take us?
p286
aVI think that 25 years from now, they'll look back
p287
aVand look at our understanding of AI and say,
p288
aV"You didn't have AI. In fact, you didn't even have the Internet yet,
p289
aVcompared to what we're going to have 25 years from now."
p290
aVThere are no AI experts right now.
p291
aVThere's a lot of money going to it,
p292
aVthere are billions of dollars being spent on it;
p293
aVit's a huge business,
p294
aVbut there are no experts, compared to what we'll know 20 years from now.
p295
aVSo we are just at the beginning of the beginning,
p296
aVwe're in the first hour of all this.
p297
aVWe're in the first hour of the Internet.
p298
aVWe're in the first hour of what's coming.
p299
aVThe most popular AI product in 20 years from now,
p300
aVthat everybody uses,
p301
aVhas not been invented yet.
p302
aVThat means that you're not late.
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
