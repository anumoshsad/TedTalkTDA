(lp3
VSo, I am indeed going to talk about
p4
aVthe spaces men create for themselves,
p5
aVbut first I want to tell you why I'm here.
p6
aVI'm here for two reasons. These two guys
p7
aVare my two sons Ford and Wren.
p8
aVWhen Ford was about three years old,
p9
aVwe shared a very small room together,
p10
aVin a very small space.
p11
aVMy office was on one half of the bedroom,
p12
aVand his bedroom was on the other half.
p13
aVAnd you can imagine, if you're a writer,
p14
aVthat things would get really crowded around deadlines.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo when Wren was on the way,
p17
aVI realized I needed to find a space of my own.
p18
aVThere was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,
p19
aVand without any previous building experience,
p20
aVand about 3,000 dollars and some
p21
aVrecycled materials, I built this space.
p22
aVIt had everything I needed. It was quiet.
p23
aVThere was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
p24
aa(lp25
VAs I was building this space, I thought
p26
aVto myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy
p27
aVto have to have carved out a space for his own."
p28
aVSo I did some research.
p29
aVAnd I found that there was an historic precedence.
p30
aVHemingway had his writing space.
p31
aVElvis had two or three manspaces,
p32
aVwhich is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
p33
aVIn the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,
p34
aVand there was, of course, the Batcave.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey
p37
aVand see what guys were creating for themselves now.
p38
aVHere is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,
p39
aVwhich is where I'm from.
p40
aVOn the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
p41
aVBut on the inside, it's anything but.
p42
aVAnd this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
p43
aVIt has neon concert posters, a bar
p44
aVand, of course, the leg lamp,
p45
aVwhich is very important.
p46
aa(lp47
VI soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
p48
aVThis guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,
p49
aVout of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
p50
aVAnd he found the scoreboard in the trash.
p51
aa(lp52
VHere's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
p53
aVThis a 1923 wooden tugboat,
p54
aVmade completely out of Douglas fir.
p55
aVThe guy did it all himself.
p56
aVAnd there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, pretty early on in my investigations
p59
aVI realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,
p60
aVwhich was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids
p61
aVand overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
p62
aVThere were definitely hang-out spots.
p63
aVBut some were for working, some were for playing,
p64
aVsome were for guys to collect their things.
p65
aVMost of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
p66
aa(lp67
VTake this place for example.
p68
aVOn the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
p69
aVThis is in Long Island, New York.
p70
aVThe only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
p71
aVOn the inside it's a recreation of a
p72
aV16th century Japanese tea house.
p73
aVThe man imported all the materials from Japan,
p74
aVand he hired a Japanese carpenter
p75
aVto build it in the traditional style.
p76
aVIt has no nails or screws.
p77
aVAll the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
p78
aa(lp79
VHere is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
p80
aVBut you open one of the garage doors
p81
aVand there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVAnd so there is a good reason for this.
p84
aVIt was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
p85
aVHe won the silver medal for Ireland
p86
aVin the 1992 Olympics,
p87
aVand he trains in this space. He trains other people.
p88
aVAnd right off the garage he has his own trophy room
p89
aVwhere he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,
p90
aVwhich is another sort of important part about a manspace.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, while this space represents someone's profession,
p93
aVthis one certainly represents a passion.
p94
aVIt's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
p95
aVIt's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
p96
aVMuseum quality.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, as I came to the end of my journey,
p99
aVI found over 50 spaces.
p100
aVAnd they were unexpected and they were surprising.
p101
aVBut they were also \u2014
p102
aVI was really impressed by how personalized they were,
p103
aVand how much work went into them.
p104
aVAnd I realized that's because the guys that I met
p105
aVwere all very passionate about what they did.
p106
aVAnd they really loved their professions.
p107
aVAnd they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
p108
aVAnd so they created these spaces
p109
aVto reflect what they love to do,
p110
aVand who they were.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo if you don't have a space of your own,
p113
aVI highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
p114
aVThank you very much.
