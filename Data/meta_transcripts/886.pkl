VThank you so much. I'm going to try to take you
p4
aVon a journey of the underwater acoustic world
p5
aVof whales and dolphins.
p6
aVSince we are such a visual species,
p7
aVit's hard for us to really understand this,
p8
aVso I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds
p9
aVand hope this can communicate it.
p10
aVBut let's also think, as a visual species,
p11
aVwhat it's like when we go snorkeling or diving
p12
aVand try to look underwater.
p13
aVWe really can't see very far.
p14
aVOur vision, which works so well in air,
p15
aVall of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.
p16
aVAnd what marine mammals have evolved
p17
aVover the last tens of millions of years
p18
aVis ways to depend on sound
p19
aVto both explore their world
p20
aVand also to stay in touch with one another.
p21
aa(lp22
VDolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.
p23
aVThey can produce loud clicks
p24
aVand listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.
p25
aVThey can listen for echoes from prey
p26
aVin order to decide where food is
p27
aVand to decide which one they want to eat.
p28
aVAll marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.
p29
aVSo the large baleen whales
p30
aVwill produce long, beautiful songs,
p31
aVwhich are used in reproductive advertisement
p32
aVfor male and females, both to find one another
p33
aVand to select a mate.
p34
aVAnd mother and young and closely bonded animals
p35
aVuse calls to stay in touch with one another,
p36
aVso sound is really critical for their lives.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe first thing that got me interested in the sounds
p39
aVof these underwater animals,
p40
aVwhose world was so foreign to me,
p41
aVwas evidence from captive dolphins
p42
aVthat captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.
p43
aVAnd I mentioned I'll use
p44
aVsome visual representations of sounds.
p45
aVHere's the first example.
p46
aVThis is a plot of frequency against time \u2014
p47
aVsort of like musical notation,
p48
aVwhere the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,
p49
aVand time goes this way.
p50
aVThis is a picture of a trainer's whistle,
p51
aVa whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin
p52
aVit's done the right thing and can come get a fish.
p53
aVIt sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.
p54
aVThis is a calf in captivity
p55
aVmaking an imitation
p56
aVof that trainer's whistle.
p57
aVIf you hummed this tune to your dog or cat
p58
aVand it hummed it back to you,
p59
aVyou ought to be pretty surprised.
p60
aVVery few nonhuman mammals
p61
aVcan imitate sounds.
p62
aVIt's really important for our music and our language.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,
p65
aVwhy do they do it?
p66
aVA lot of my career has been devoted
p67
aVto trying to understand
p68
aVhow these animals use their learning,
p69
aVuse the ability to change what you say
p70
aVbased on what you hear
p71
aVin their own communication systems.
p72
aVSo let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.
p73
aVMany mammals have to produce contact calls
p74
aVwhen, say, a mother and calf are apart.
p75
aVThis is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys
p76
aVwhen they're isolated from another one.
p77
aVAnd you can see, there's not much
p78
aVvariability in these calls.
p79
aVBy contrast, the signature whistle
p80
aVwhich dolphins use to stay in touch,
p81
aVeach individual here has a radically different call.
p82
aVThey can use this ability to learn calls
p83
aVin order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls
p84
aVto identify individuals.
p85
aa(lp86
VHow about the setting in which animals need to use this call?
p87
aVWell let's look at mothers and calves.
p88
aVIn normal life for mother and calf dolphin,
p89
aVthey'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,
p90
aVand when they separate
p91
aVthey have to get back together again.
p92
aVWhat this figure shows is the percentage of the separations
p93
aVin which dolphins whistle,
p94
aVagainst the maximum distance.
p95
aVSo when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,
p96
aVless than half the time they need to use whistles.
p97
aVMost of the time they can just find each other
p98
aVjust by swimming around.
p99
aVBut all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,
p100
aVthey need to use these individually distinctive whistles
p101
aVto come back together again.
p102
aVMost of these distinctive signature whistles
p103
aVare quite stereotyped and stable
p104
aVthrough the life of a dolphin.
p105
aVBut there are some exceptions.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhen a male dolphin leaves Mom,
p108
aVit will often join up with another male
p109
aVand form an alliance, which may last for decades.
p110
aVAs these two animals form a social bond,
p111
aVtheir distinctive whistles actually converge
p112
aVand become very similar.
p113
aVThis plot shows two members of a pair.
p114
aVAs you can see at the top here,
p115
aVthey share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."
p116
aVThey both have that kind of up-sweep.
p117
aVWhereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."
p118
aVAnd what's happened is
p119
aVthey've used this learning process
p120
aVto develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.
p121
aVIt's a very interesting way that they can
p122
aVform a new identifier
p123
aVfor the new social group that they've had.
p124
aa(lp125
VLet's now take a step back
p126
aVand see what this message can tell us
p127
aVabout protecting dolphins
p128
aVfrom human disturbance.
p129
aVAnybody looking at this picture
p130
aVwill know this dolphin is surrounded,
p131
aVand clearly his behavior is being disrupted.
p132
aVThis is a bad situation.
p133
aVBut it turns out that when just a single boat
p134
aVis approaching a group of dolphins
p135
aVat a couple hundred meters away,
p136
aVthe dolphins will start whistling,
p137
aVthey'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,
p138
aVwait for the boat to go by,
p139
aVand then they'll get back to normal business.
p140
aVWell, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,
p141
aVthe average interval between times
p142
aVthat a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group
p143
aVis six minutes.
p144
aVSo even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,
p145
aVit's still affecting the amount of time these animals have
p146
aVto do their normal work.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,
p149
aVLars Bider has done work
p150
aVcomparing dolphin behavior and distribution
p151
aVbefore there were dolphin-watching boats.
p152
aVWhen there was one boat, not much of an impact.
p153
aVAnd two boats: When the second boat was added,
p154
aVwhat happened was that some of the dolphins
p155
aVleft the area completely.
p156
aVOf the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.
p157
aVSo it could have a negative impact on the whole population.
p158
aVWhen we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,
p159
aVthis means that we have to be
p160
aVquite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.
p161
aVWe may need to regulate the intensity
p162
aVof recreational boating and actual whale watching
p163
aVin order to prevent these kinds of problems.
p164
aVI'd also like to point out that sound
p165
aVdoesn't obey boundaries.
p166
aVSo you can draw a line to try to protect an area,
p167
aVbut chemical pollution and noise pollution
p168
aVwill continue to move through the area.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I'd like to switch now from this local,
p171
aVfamiliar, coastal environment
p172
aVto a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.
p173
aVThis is a kind of map we've all been looking at.
p174
aVThe world is mostly blue.
p175
aVBut I'd also like to point out that the oceans
p176
aVare much more connected than we think.
p177
aVNotice how few barriers there are to movement
p178
aVacross all of the oceans compared to land.
p179
aVTo me, the most mind-bending example
p180
aVof the interconnectedness of the ocean
p181
aVcomes from an acoustic experiment
p182
aVwhere oceanographers
p183
aVtook a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,
p184
aVdeployed an underwater loudspeaker
p185
aVand played back a sound.
p186
aVThat same sound
p187
aVtraveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,
p188
aVand traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey \u2014
p189
aVthe same sound.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo we live in a world of satellite communication,
p192
aVare used to global communication,
p193
aVbut it's still amazing to me.
p194
aVThe ocean has properties
p195
aVthat allow low-frequency sound
p196
aVto basically move globally.
p197
aVThe acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.
p198
aVIt's nearly halfway around the globe.
p199
aVIn the early '70s,
p200
aVRoger Payne and an ocean acoustician
p201
aVpublished a theoretical paper
p202
aVpointing out that it was possible
p203
aVthat sound could transmit over these large areas,
p204
aVbut very few biologists believed it.
p205
aa(lp206
VIt actually turns out, though,
p207
aVeven though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,
p208
aVthe whales clearly have evolved,
p209
aVover tens of millions of years,
p210
aVa way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.
p211
aVSo blue whales and fin whales
p212
aVproduce very low-frequency sounds
p213
aVthat can travel over very long ranges.
p214
aVThe top plot here shows
p215
aVa complicated series of calls
p216
aVthat are repeated by males.
p217
aVThey form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,
p218
aVsort of like that of song birds.
p219
aVDown below here, we see calls made by both males and females
p220
aVthat also carry over very long ranges.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe biologists continued to be skeptical
p223
aVof the long-range communication issue
p224
aVwell past the '70s,
p225
aVuntil the end of the Cold War.
p226
aVWhat happened was, during the Cold War,
p227
aVthe U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,
p228
aVthat they used to track Russian submarines.
p229
aVIt had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,
p230
aVcabled to shore,
p231
aVall wired back to a central place that could listen
p232
aVto sounds over the whole North Atlantic.
p233
aVAnd after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available
p234
aVto whale bio-acousticians
p235
aVto see what they could hear.
p236
aa(lp237
VThis is a plot from Christopher Clark
p238
aVwho tracked one individual blue whale
p239
aVas it passed by Bermuda,
p240
aVwent down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.
p241
aVIt was tracked for 43 days,
p242
aVswimming 1,700 kilometers,
p243
aVor more than 1,000 miles.
p244
aVThis shows us both that the calls
p245
aVare detectable over hundreds of miles
p246
aVand that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.
p247
aVThey're ocean-based and scale animals
p248
aVwho are communicating over much longer ranges
p249
aVthan we had anticipated.
p250
aa(lp251
VUnlike fins and blues, which
p252
aVdisperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,
p253
aVthe humpbacked whales congregate
p254
aVin local traditional breeding grounds,
p255
aVso they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,
p256
aVbroader-band and more complicated.
p257
aVSo you're listening to the complicated song
p258
aVproduced by humpbacks here.
p259
aVHumpbacks, when they develop
p260
aVthe ability to sing this song,
p261
aVthey're listening to other whales
p262
aVand modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,
p263
aVjust like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.
p264
aVThis means that humpback song
p265
aVis a form of animal culture,
p266
aVjust like music for humans would be.
p267
aa(lp268
VI think one of the most interesting examples of this
p269
aVcomes from Australia.
p270
aVBiologists on the east coast of Australia
p271
aVwere recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.
p272
aVAnd this orange line here marks the typical songs
p273
aVof east coast humpbacks.
p274
aVIn '95 they all sang the normal song.
p275
aVBut in '96 they heard a few weird songs,
p276
aVand it turned out that these strange songs
p277
aVwere typical of west coast whales.
p278
aVThe west coast calls became more and more popular,
p279
aVuntil by 1998,
p280
aVnone of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.
p281
aVThey just sang the cool new west coast song.
p282
aVIt's as if some new hit style
p283
aVhad completely wiped out
p284
aVthe old-fashioned style before,
p285
aVand with no golden oldies stations.
p286
aVNobody sang the old ones.
p287
aa(lp288
VI'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.
p289
aVNow you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,
p290
aV0.2 miles away from a humpback.
p291
aVYou can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.
p292
aVYou sound very nearby.
p293
aVThe next recording you're going to hear
p294
aVwas made of the same humpback song
p295
aV50 miles away.
p296
aVThat's shown down here.
p297
aVYou only hear the low frequencies.
p298
aVYou hear the reverberation
p299
aVas the sound travels over long-range in the ocean
p300
aVand is not quite as loud.
p301
aVNow after I play back these humpback calls,
p302
aVI'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up
p303
aVbecause they're so low in frequency
p304
aVthat you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.
p305
aVHere's a blue whale call at 50 miles,
p306
aVwhich was distant for the humpback.
p307
aVIt's loud, clear \u2014 you can hear it very clearly.
p308
aVHere's the same call recorded from a hydrophone
p309
aV500 miles away.
p310
aVThere's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.
p311
aVBut you can still hear that faint call.
p312
aa(lp313
VLet's now switch and think about
p314
aVa potential for human impacts.
p315
aVThe most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean
p316
aVcomes from shipping.
p317
aVThis is the sound of a ship,
p318
aVand I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.
p319
aVImagine that whale listening from 500 miles.
p320
aVThere's a potential problem that maybe
p321
aVthis kind of shipping noise would prevent whales
p322
aVfrom being able to hear each other.
p323
aVNow this is something that's been known for quite a while.
p324
aa(lp325
VThis is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.
p326
aVAnd on the y-axis
p327
aVis the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean
p328
aVby frequency.
p329
aVIn the low frequencies, this line indicates
p330
aVsound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.
p331
aVUp high, these variable lines
p332
aVindicate increasing noise in this frequency range
p333
aVfrom higher wind and wave.
p334
aVBut right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,
p335
aVthe noise is dominated by human ships.
p336
aVNow think about it. This is an amazing thing:
p337
aVThat in this frequency range where whales communicate,
p338
aVthe main source globally, on our planet, for the noise
p339
aVcomes from human ships,
p340
aVthousands of human ships, distant, far away,
p341
aVjust all aggregating.
p342
aa(lp343
VThe next slide will show what the impact this may have
p344
aVon the range at which whales can communicate.
p345
aVSo here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.
p346
aVAnd as we get farther away,
p347
aVthe sound gets fainter and fainter.
p348
aVNow in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,
p349
aVthis whale call could be easily detected.
p350
aVIt's louder than noise
p351
aVat a range of a thousand kilometers.
p352
aVLet's now take that additional increase in noise
p353
aVthat we saw comes from shipping.
p354
aVAll of a sudden, the effective range of communication
p355
aVgoes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.
p356
aVNow if this signal is used for males and females
p357
aVto find each other for mating and they're dispersed,
p358
aVimagine the impact this could have
p359
aVon the recovery of endangered populations.
p360
aa(lp361
VWhales also have contact calls
p362
aVlike I described for the dolphins.
p363
aVI'll play the sound of a contact call used
p364
aVby right whales to stay in touch.
p365
aVAnd this is the kind of call that is used by,
p366
aVsay, right whale mothers and calves
p367
aVas they separate to come back again.
p368
aVNow imagine \u2014 let's put the ship noise in the picture.
p369
aVWhat's a mother to do
p370
aVif the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?
p371
aVI'll describe a couple strategies.
p372
aa(lp373
VOne strategy is if your call's down here,
p374
aVand the noise is in this band,
p375
aVyou could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band
p376
aVand communicate better.
p377
aVSusan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.
p378
aVShe's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.
p379
aVHere's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.
p380
aVLook what happened by 2000 to the average call.
p381
aVSame thing in the North Atlantic,
p382
aVin the '50s versus 2000.
p383
aVOver the last 50 years,
p384
aVas we've put more noise into the oceans,
p385
aVthese whales have had to shift.
p386
aVIt's as if the whole population had to shift
p387
aVfrom being basses to singing as a tenor.
p388
aVIt's an amazing shift, induced by humans
p389
aVover this large scale,
p390
aVin both time and space.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd we now know that whales can compensate for noise
p393
aVby calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,
p394
aVby waiting for silence
p395
aVand by shifting their call out of the noise band.
p396
aVNow there's probably costs to calling louder
p397
aVor shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,
p398
aVand there's probably lost opportunities.
p399
aVIf we also have to wait for silence,
p400
aVthey may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.
p401
aVSo we have to be very concerned
p402
aVabout when the noise in habitats
p403
aVdegrades the habitat enough
p404
aVthat the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,
p405
aVor are not able to perform critical functions.
p406
aVIt's a really important problem.
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd I'm happy to say that there are several
p409
aVvery promising developments in this area,
p410
aVlooking at the impact of shipping on whales.
p411
aVIn terms of the shipping noise,
p412
aVthe International Maritime Organization of the United Nations
p413
aVhas formed a group whose job is to establish
p414
aVguidelines for quieting ships,
p415
aVto tell the industry how you could quiet ships.
p416
aVAnd they've already found
p417
aVthat by being more intelligent about better propeller design,
p418
aVyou can reduce that noise by 90 percent.
p419
aVIf you actually insulate and isolate
p420
aVthe machinery of the ship from the hull,
p421
aVyou can reduce that noise by 99 percent.
p422
aVSo at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.
p423
aVIf this group can establish standards,
p424
aVand if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,
p425
aVwe can now see a gradual decline
p426
aVin this potential problem.
p427
aa(lp428
VBut there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,
p429
aVand that's the problem of collision.
p430
aVThis is a whale that just squeaked by
p431
aVa rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.
p432
aVBut collision is a serious problem.
p433
aVEndangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,
p434
aVand it's very important to try to reduce this.
p435
aVI'll discuss two very promising approaches.
p436
aVThe first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
p437
aVThese black lines mark shipping lanes
p438
aVin and out of the Bay of Fundy.
p439
aVThe colorized area
p440
aVshows the risk of collision for endangered right whales
p441
aVbecause of the ships moving in this lane.
p442
aVIt turns out that this lane here
p443
aVgoes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,
p444
aVand it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.
p445
aVWell, biologists
p446
aVwho couldn't take no for an answer
p447
aVwent to the International Maritime Organization
p448
aVand petitioned them to say,
p449
aV"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.
p450
aVCan't you move them over to a place
p451
aVwhere there's less of a risk?"
p452
aVAnd the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,
p453
aV"These are the new lanes."
p454
aVThe shipping lanes have been moved.
p455
aVAnd as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.
p456
aa(lp457
VSo it's very promising, actually.
p458
aVWe can be very creative about thinking
p459
aVof different ways to reduce these risks.
p460
aVAnother action which was just taken independently
p461
aVby a shipping company itself

aVwas initiated because of concerns the shipping company had
p463
aVabout greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.
p464
aVThe Maersk Line looked at their competition
p465
aVand saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.
p466
aVThey rush as fast as they can to get to their port.
p467
aVBut then they often wait there.
p468
aVWhat Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.
p469
aVThey could slow down by about 50 percent.
p470
aVThis reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,
p471
aVwhich saved them money,
p472
aVand at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.
p473
aVIt you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make
p474
aVand you reduce the risk of collision.

VSo to conclude, I'd just like to point out,
p477
aVyou know, the whales live in
p478
aVan amazing acoustic environment.
p479
aVThey've evolved over tens of millions of years
p480
aVto take advantage of this.
p481
aVAnd we need to be very attentive and vigilant
p482
aVto thinking about where things that we do
p483
aVmay unintentionally prevent them
p484
aVfrom being able to achieve their important activities.
p485
aVAt the same time, we need to be really creative
p486
aVin thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.
p487
aVI hope these examples have shown
p488
aVsome of the different directions we can take
p489
aVin addition to protected areas
p490
aVto be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate.
