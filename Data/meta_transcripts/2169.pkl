VI'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,
p4
aVand I'll explain how these identities come together.
p5
aa(lp6
VIt started four years ago,
p7
aVwhen a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast
p8
aVat one of the busiest mosques in New York City.
p9
aVCrowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets.
p10
aVIt was an FBI agent's wet dream. (Laughter)
p11
aVBut being a part of this community, we knew how welcoming this space was.
p12
aVFor years, I'd seen photos  of this space being documented
p13
aVas a lifeless and cold monolith,
p14
aVmuch like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience.
p15
aa(lp16
VFrustrated by this myopic view,
p17
aVmy friend and I had this crazy idea:
p18
aVLet's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state
p19
aVeach night of Ramadan
p20
aVand share those stories on a blog.
p21
aVWe called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,"
p22
aVand we drove to all the 50 states
p23
aVand shared stories from over 100 vastly different Muslim communities,
p24
aVranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects
p25
aVto the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina.
p26
aVWhat emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America.
p27
aVThe media coverage forced local journalists
p28
aVto revisit their Muslim communities,
p29
aVbut what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world
p30
aVbeing inspired to take their own 30-mosque journey.
p31
aVThere were even these two NFL athletes
p32
aVwho took a sabbatical from the league to do so.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd as 30 Mosques was blossoming around the world,
p35
aVI was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film.
p36
aVMy codirector, Omar, and I were at  a breaking point with many of our friends
p37
aVon how to position the film.
p38
aVThe movie is called "These Birds Walk,"
p39
aVand it is about wayward street kids
p40
aVwho are struggling to find some semblance of family.
p41
aVWe focus on the complexities of youth and family discord,
p42
aVbut our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings
p43
aVto make the film "more relevant,"
p44
aVessentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories
p45
aVinto sociopolitical symbols.
p46
aVOf course, we didn't listen to them,
p47
aVand instead, we championed the tender gestures of love
p48
aVand headlong flashes of youth.
p49
aVThe agenda behind our cinematic  immersion was only empathy,
p50
aVan emotion that's largely  deficient from films
p51
aVthat come from our region of the world.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd as "These Birds Walk" played at film  festivals and theaters internationally,
p54
aVI finally had my feet planted at home in New York,
p55
aVand with all the extra time and still no real money,
p56
aVmy wife tasked me to cook more for us.
p57
aVAnd whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat,
p58
aVsomething felt off.
p59
aa(lp60
VFor those that don't know, halal is a term used for meat
p61
aVthat is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines.
p62
aVUnfortunately, the majority of halal meat in America
p63
aVdoesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for.
p64
aVThe more I learned about these unethical practices,
p65
aVthe more violated I felt,
p66
aVparticularly because businesses from my own community
p67
aVwere the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy.
p68
aVSo, with emotions running high, and absolutely no experience in butchery,
p69
aVsome friends and I opened a meat store
p70
aVin the heart of the East Village fashion district.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVWe call it Honest Chops,
p73
aVand we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic, humanely raised animals,
p74
aVand by making it accessible and affordable to working-class families.
p75
aVThere's really nothing like it in America.
p76
aVThe unbelievable part is actually that 90 percent of our in-store customers
p77
aVare not even Muslim.
p78
aVFor many, it is their first time  interacting with Islam
p79
aVon such an intimate level.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo all these disparate projects \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p82
aVare the result of a restlessness.
p83
aVThey are a visceral response to the businesses and curators
p84
aVwho work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community,
p85
aVand the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules.
p86
aVWe must fight with an inventive approach.
p87
aVWith the trust, with the access, with the love that only we can bring,
p88
aVwe must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs
p89
aVin every moving image, in every cut of meat,
p90
aVbecause if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal,
p91
aVnot only will we fail,
p92
aVbut we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources
p93
aVto tell our stories.
p94
aVBut the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance.
p95
aVIt is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.
p96
aVThey demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected.
p97
aVThank you.
