VWhen I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California,
p4
aVand I lived in a little town called Elk
p5
aVon the Mendocino coast,
p6
aVand I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail,
p7
aVand life was good back then, if you could remember it.
p8
aVI'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee
p9
aVand a brownie, and I'd ship my film
p10
aVto San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later,
p11
aVit would end up on my front door,
p12
aVwhich was way better than having to fight the traffic
p13
aVof Hollywood. (Music)
p14
aVI didn't have much money,
p15
aVbut I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music)
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I started shooting time-lapse photography.
p18
aVIt would take me a month to shoot a four-minute
p19
aVroll of film, because that's all I could afford.
p20
aa(lp21
VI've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously,
p22
aVnon-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
p23
aVfor over 30 years, and to see them move
p24
aVis a dance I'll never get tired of.
p25
aVTheir beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
p26
aVIt also provides a third of the food we eat.
p27
aV(Music)
p28
aVBeauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival,
p29
aVbecause we protect what we fall in love with.
p30
aVIt opens our hearts, and makes us realize
p31
aVwe are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.
p32
aVWhen we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us
p33
aVto every one of us, because it's clear
p34
aVthat it's all connected in one.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,
p37
aV"Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant?
p38
aVThe "oh" means it caught your attention,
p39
aVmakes you present, makes you mindful.
p40
aVThe "my" means it connects with something deep
p41
aVinside your soul.
p42
aVIt creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up
p43
aVand be heard. And "God"?
p44
aVGod is that personal journey we all want to be on,
p45
aVto be inspired, to feel like we're connected to a universe
p46
aVthat celebrates life.
p47
aa(lp48
VDid you know that 80 percent
p49
aVof the information we receive comes through our eyes?
p50
aVAnd if you compare light energy to musical scales,
p51
aVit would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,
p52
aVwhich is right in the middle?
p53
aVAnd aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know,
p54
aVtake this electrical impulse that comes from light energy
p55
aVto create images in order for us to explore our world?
p56
aVAnd aren't we grateful that we have hearts
p57
aVthat can feel these vibrations
p58
aVin order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure
p59
aVand the beauty of nature?
p60
aV(Music)
p61
aa(lp62
VNature's beauty is a gift that cultivates
p63
aVappreciation and gratitude.
p64
aV(Music)
p65
aVSo I have a gift I want to share with you today,
p66
aVa project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed,
p67
aVand it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective
p68
aVfrom the point of view of a child and an elderly man
p69
aVof that world.
p70
aa(lp71
VChild: When I watch TV,
p72
aVit's just some shows that you just \u2014 that are pretend,
p73
aVand when you explore, you get
p74
aVmore imagination than you already had,
p75
aVand when you get more imagination,
p76
aVit makes you want to go deeper in
p77
aVso you can get more and see beautifuller things,
p78
aVlike the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach,
p79
aVor something, and it could be beautiful.

VElderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life?
p83
aVIt's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you
p84

aVIt's given to you. It's a gift.
p86
aVIt's the only gift that you have right now,

p97
aVthat you have eyes you can open,
p98
aVthat incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us
p99
aVfor pure enjoyment.
p100
aVLook at the sky.
p101
aVWe so rarely look at the sky.
p102
aVWe so rarely note how different it is
p103
aVfrom moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.
p104
aVWe just think of the weather,
p105
aVand even with the weather, we don't think of
p106
aVall the many nuances of weather.
p107
aVWe just think of good weather and bad weather.
p108
aVThis day, right now, has unique weather,
p109
aVmaybe a kind that will never exactly
p110
aVin that form come again.
p111
aVThat formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same
p112
aVas it is right now.
p113
aVOpen your eyes. Look at that.
p114
aa(lp115
VLook at the faces of people whom you meet.
p116
aVEach one has an incredible story behind their face,
p117
aVa story that you could never fully fathom,
p118
aVnot only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.
p119
aVWe all go back so far,
p120
aVand in this present moment, on this day,
p121
aVall the people you meet, all that life from generations
p122
aVand from so many places all over the world
p123
aVflows together and meets you here

VOpen your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization
p128
aVgives to us.

aVYou flip a switch and there is electric light.
p130
aVYou turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water,
p131
aVand drinkable water.
p132
aVIt's a gift that millions and millions in the world
p133
aVwill never experience.
p134
