VI experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.
p4
aVBecause of the coup d'état,
p5
aVmy family had to leave my native home of Ghana
p6
aVand move to the Gambia.
p7
aVAs luck would have it,
p8
aVsix months after we arrived,
p9
aVthey too had a military coup.
p10
aVI vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night
p11
aVand gathering the few belongings we could
p12
aVand walking for about two hours
p13
aVto a safe house.
p14
aVFor a week, we slept under our beds
p15
aVbecause we were worried that bullets might fly through the window.
p16
aa(lp17
VThen, at the age of eight,
p18
aVwe moved to Botswana.
p19
aVThis time, it was different.
p20
aVThere were no coups.
p21
aVEverything worked. Great education.
p22
aVThey had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had
p23
aVa fiber-optic telephone system,
p24
aVlong before it had reached Western countries.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe only thing they didn't have
p27
aVis that they didn't have
p28
aVtheir own national television station,
p29
aVand so I remember watching
p30
aVTV from neighboring South Africa,
p31
aVand watching Nelson Mandela in jail
p32
aVbeing offered a chance to come out
p33
aVif he would give up the apartheid struggle.
p34
aVBut he didn't. He refused to do that
p35
aVuntil he actually achieved his objective
p36
aVof freeing South Africa from apartheid.
p37
aVAnd I remember feeling how just one good leader
p38
aVcould make such a big difference in Africa.
p39
aa(lp40
VThen at the age of 12,
p41
aVmy family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.
p42
aVInitially, this too was amazing:
p43
aVgrowing economy, excellent infrastructure,
p44
aVand it seemed like it was a model
p45
aVfor economic development in Africa.
p46
aVI graduated from high school in Zimbabwe
p47
aVand I went off to college.
p48
aa(lp49
VSix years later, I returned to the country.
p50
aVEverything was different.
p51
aVIt had shattered into pieces.
p52
aVMillions of people had emigrated,
p53
aVthe economy was in a shambles,
p54
aVand it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years
p55
aVof development had been wiped out.
p56
aVHow could a country go so bad so fast?
p57
aVMost people would agree
p58
aVthat it's all because of leadership.
p59
aVOne man, President Robert Mugabe,
p60
aVis almost single-handedly responsible
p61
aVfor having destroyed this country.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, all these experiences of living in different
p64
aVparts of Africa growing up
p65
aVdid two things to me.
p66
aVThe first is it made me fall in love with Africa.
p67
aVEverywhere I went,
p68
aVI experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent
p69
aVand saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,
p70
aVand at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate
p71
aVthe rest of my life to making this continent great.
p72
aVBut I also realized that making Africa great
p73
aVwould require addressing this issue of leadership.
p74
aVYou see, all these countries I lived in,
p75
aVthe coups d'état
p76
aVand the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia
p77
aVand in Zimbabwe,
p78
aVcontrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen
p79
aVin Botswana and in South  Africa of good leadership.
p80
aVIt made me realize that Africa would rise or fall
p81
aVbecause of the quality of our leaders.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, one might think, of course,
p84
aVleadership matters everywhere.
p85
aVBut if there's one thing you take away from my talk today, it is this:
p86
aVIn Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,
p87
aVthe difference that just one good leader can make
p88
aVis much greater than anywhere  else, and here's why.
p89
aVIt's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,
p90
aVlike the judiciary, the constitution,
p91
aVcivil society and so forth.
p92
aVSo here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:
p93
aVWhen societies have strong institutions,
p94
aVthe difference that one good leader can make is limited,
p95
aVbut when you have weak institutions,
p96
aVthen just one good leader
p97
aVcan make or break that country.
p98
aa(lp99
VLet me make it a bit more concrete.
p100
aVYou become the president of the United States.
p101
aVYou think, "Wow, I've arrived.
p102
aVI'm the most powerful man in the world."
p103
aVSo you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.
p104
aVAll of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder
p105
aVand says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."
p106
aVYou say, "Let me try this way."
p107
aVThe Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,
p108
aVwe don't think you can do that."
p109
aVYou say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.
p110
aVI think the economy needs a stimulus."
p111
aVThe central bank governor will think you're crazy.
p112
aVYou might get impeached for that.
p113
aVBut if you become the president of Zimbabwe,
p114
aVand you say, "You know, I really like this job.
p115
aVI think I'd like to stay in it forever." (Laughter)
p116
aVWell, you just can.
p117
aVYou decide you want to print money.
p118
aVYou call the central bank governor and you say,
p119
aV"Please double the money supply."
p120
aVHe'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,
p121
aVis there anything else I can do for you?"
p122
aVThis is the power that African leaders have,
p123
aVand this is why they make the most difference
p124
aVon the continent.
p125
aa(lp126
VThe good news is that
p127
aVthe quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.
p128
aVWe've had three generations  of leaders, in my mind.
p129
aVGeneration one are those who appeared
p130
aVin the '50s and '60s.
p131
aVThese are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana
p132
aVand Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
p133
aVThe legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa.
p134
aVThey freed us from colonialism,
p135
aVand let's give them credit for that.
p136
aVThey were followed by generation two.
p137
aVThese are people that brought nothing
p138
aVbut havoc to Africa.
p139
aVThink warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.
p140
aVThis is the stereotype of  the typical African leader
p141
aVthat we typically think of:
p142
aVMobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,
p143
aVSani Abacha from Nigeria.
p144
aVThe good news is that most of these leaders have moved on,
p145
aVand they were replaced by generation three.
p146
aVThese are people like the late Nelson Mandela
p147
aVand most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,
p148
aVlike Paul Kagame and so forth.
p149
aVNow these leaders are by no means perfect,
p150
aVbut the one thing they have done is that they have
p151
aVcleaned up much of the mess of generation two.
p152
aVThey've stopped the fighting,
p153
aVand I call them the stabilizer generation.
p154
aVThey're much more accountable to their people,
p155
aVthey've improved macroeconomic policies,
p156
aVand we are seeing for the first time
p157
aVAfrica's growing, and in  fact it's the second fastest
p158
aVgrowing economic region in the world.
p159
aVSo these leaders are by no means perfect,
p160
aVbut they are by and large
p161
aVthe best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo where to from here?
p164
aVI believe that the next generation
p165
aVto come after this, generation four,
p166
aVhas a unique opportunity
p167
aVto transform the continent.
p168
aVSpecifically, they can do two things
p169
aVthat previous generations have not done.
p170
aVThe first thing they need to do
p171
aVis they need to create prosperity for the continent.
p172
aVWhy is prosperity so important?
p173
aVBecause none of the previous generations
p174
aVhave been able to tackle this issue of poverty.
p175
aVAfrica today
p176
aVhas the fastest growing population in the world,
p177
aVbut also is the poorest.
p178
aVBy 2030, Africa will have a larger workforce than China,
p179
aVand by 2050, it will have the largest workforce in the world.
p180
aVOne billion people will need jobs in Africa,
p181
aVso if we don't grow our economies fast enough,
p182
aVwe're sitting on a ticking time bomb,
p183
aVnot just for Africa but for the entire world.
p184
aa(lp185
VLet me show you an example
p186
aVof one person who is living up to this legacy
p187
aVof creating prosperity: Laetitia.
p188
aVLaetitia's a young woman from Kenya
p189
aVwho at the age of 13 had to drop out of school
p190
aVbecause her family couldn't  afford to pay fees for her.
p191
aVSo she started her own business rearing rabbits,
p192
aVwhich happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya
p193
aVthat she's from.
p194
aVThis business did so well that within a year,
p195
aVshe was employing 15 women
p196
aVand was able to generate enough income
p197
aVthat she was able to send herself to school,
p198
aVand through these women
p199
aVfund another 65 children to go to school.
p200
aVThe profits that she generated,
p201
aVshe used that to build a school,
p202
aVand today she educates
p203
aV400 children in her community.
p204
aVAnd she's just turned 18.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnother example is Erick Rajaonary.
p208
aVErick comes from the island of Madagascar.
p209
aVNow, Erick realized that agriculture
p210
aVwould be the key to creating jobs
p211
aVin the rural areas of Madagascar,
p212
aVbut he also realized that fertilizer was a very
p213
aVexpensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.
p214
aVMadagascar has these very special bats
p215
aVthat produce these droppings
p216
aVthat are very high in nutrients.
p217
aVIn 2006, Erick quit his job  as a chartered accountant
p218
aVand started a company to manufacture
p219
aVfertilizer from the bat droppings.
p220
aVToday, Erick has built a business
p221
aVthat generates several million dollars of revenue,
p222
aVand he employs 70 people full time
p223
aVand another 800 people during the season
p224
aVwhen the bats drop their droppings the most.
p225
aVNow, what I like about this story
p226
aVis that it shows that opportunities  to create prosperity
p227
aVcan be found almost anywhere.
p228
aVErick is known as the Batman.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVAnd who would have thought that you would have
p231
aVbeen able to build a multimillion-dollar business
p232
aVemploying so many people just from bat poo?
p233
aVThe second thing that this generation needs to do
p234
aVis to create our institutions.
p235
aVThey need to build these institutions such that we
p236
aVare never held to ransom again
p237
aVby a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, all of this sounds great,
p240
aVbut where are we going to get this generation four from?
p241
aVDo we just sit and hope that they emerge
p242
aVby chance, or that God gives them to us?
p243
aVNo, I don't think so.
p244
aVIt's too important an issue  for us to leave it to chance.
p245
aVI believe that we need to create African institutions,
p246
aVhome-grown, that will identify and develop
p247
aVthese leaders in a systematic, practical way.
p248
aVWe've been doing this for the last 10 years
p249
aVthrough the African Leadership Academy.
p250
aVLaetitia is one of our young leaders.
p251
aVToday, we have 700 of them  that are being groomed
p252
aVfor the African continent,
p253
aVand over the next 50 years,
p254
aVwe expect to create 6,000 of them.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut one thing has been troubling me.
p257
aVWe would get about 4,000 applications a year
p258
aVfor 100 young leaders that we could take
p259
aVinto this academy,
p260
aVand so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed
p261
aVfor this leadership training that we're offering.
p262
aVBut we couldn't satisfy it.
p263
aVSo today, I'm announcing for the first time in public
p264
aVan extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy.
p265
aVWe're building 25 brand new universities in Africa
p266
aVthat are going to cultivate this next generation
p267
aVof African leaders.
p268
aVEach campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time
p269
aVso we'll be educating and developing
p270
aV250,000 leaders at any given time.
p271
aV(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VOver the next 50 years, this institution
p274
aVwill create three million transformative leaders
p275
aVfor the continent.
p276
aa(lp277
VMy hope is that half of them
p278
aVwill become the entrepreneurs that we need,
p279
aVwho will create these jobs that we need,
p280
aVand the other half
p281
aVwill go into government
p282
aVand the nonprofit sector,
p283
aVand they will build the institutions that we need.
p284
aVBut they won't just learn academics.
p285
aVThey will also learn how to become leaders,
p286
aVand they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.
p287
aVSo think of this as Africa's Ivy League,
p288
aVbut instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores
p289
aVor because of how much money you have
p290
aVor which family you come from,
p291
aVthe main criteria for getting into this university
p292
aVwill be what is the potential that you have
p293
aVfor transforming Africa?
p294
aa(lp295
VBut what we're doing is  just one group of institutions.
p296
aVWe cannot transform Africa by ourselves.
p297
aVMy hope
p298
aVis that many, many other home-grown
p299
aVAfrican institutions will blossom,
p300
aVand these institutions will all come together
p301
aVwith a common vision of developing
p302
aVthis next generation of African leaders,
p303
aVgeneration four,
p304
aVand they will teach them this common message:
p305
aVcreate jobs, build our institutions.
p306
aa(lp307
VNelson Mandela once said,
p308
aV"Every now and then,
p309
aVa generation is called upon to be great.
p310
aVYou can be that great generation."
p311
aVI believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate
p312
aVthe next generation of African leaders,
p313
aVthen this generation four that is coming up
p314
aVwill be the greatest generation that Africa
p315
aVand indeed the entire world has ever seen.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
