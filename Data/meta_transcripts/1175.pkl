VI'm a savant,
p4
aVor more precisely,
p5
aVa high-functioning
p6
aVautistic savant.
p7
aVIt's a rare condition.
p8
aVAnd rarer still when accompanied,
p9
aVas in my case,
p10
aVby self-awareness
p11
aVand a mastery of language.
p12
aVVery often when I meet someone
p13
aVand they learn this about me,
p14
aVthere's a certain kind of awkwardness.
p15
aVI can see it in their eyes.
p16
aVThey want to ask me something.
p17
aVAnd in the end, quite often,
p18
aVthe urge is stronger than they are
p19
aVand they blurt it out:
p20
aV"If I give you my date of birth,
p21
aVcan you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVOr they mention cube roots
p24
aVor ask me to recite a long number or long text.
p25
aVI hope you'll forgive me
p26
aVif I don't perform
p27
aVa kind of one-man savant show for you today.
p28
aVI'm going to talk instead
p29
aVabout something
p30
aVfar more interesting
p31
aVthan dates of birth or cube roots \u2014
p32
aVa little deeper
p33
aVand a lot closer, to my mind, than work.
p34
aa(lp35
VI want to talk to you briefly
p36
aVabout perception.
p37
aVWhen he was writing the plays and the short stories
p38
aVthat would make his name,
p39
aVAnton Chekhov kept a notebook
p40
aVin which he noted down
p41
aVhis observations
p42
aVof the world around him \u2014
p43
aVlittle details
p44
aVthat other people seem to miss.
p45
aVEvery time I read Chekhov
p46
aVand his unique vision of human life,
p47
aVI'm reminded of why I too
p48
aVbecame a writer.
p49
aVIn my books,
p50
aVI explore the nature of perception
p51
aVand how different kinds of perceiving
p52
aVcreate different kinds of knowing
p53
aVand understanding.
p54
aa(lp55
VHere are three questions
p56
aVdrawn from my work.
p57
aVRather than try to figure them out,
p58
aVI'm going to ask you to consider for a moment
p59
aVthe intuitions
p60
aVand the gut instincts
p61
aVthat are going through your head and your heart
p62
aVas you look at them.
p63
aVFor example, the calculation:
p64
aVcan you feel where on the number line
p65
aVthe solution is likely to fall?
p66
aVOr look at the foreign word and the sounds:
p67
aVcan you get a sense of the range of meanings
p68
aVthat it's pointing you towards?
p69
aVAnd in terms of the line of poetry,
p70
aVwhy does the poet use the word hare
p71
aVrather than rabbit?
p72
aVI'm asking you to do this
p73
aVbecause I believe our personal perceptions, you see,
p74
aVare at the heart
p75
aVof how we acquire knowledge.
p76
aVAesthetic judgments,
p77
aVrather than abstract reasoning,
p78
aVguide and shape the process
p79
aVby which we all come to know
p80
aVwhat we know.
p81
aVI'm an extreme example of this.
p82
aa(lp83
VMy worlds of words and numbers
p84
aVblur with color, emotion
p85
aVand personality.
p86
aVAs Juan said,
p87
aVit's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,
p88
aVan unusual cross-talk
p89
aVbetween the senses.
p90
aVHere are the numbers one to 12
p91
aVas I see them \u2014
p92
aVevery number with its own shape and character.
p93
aVOne is a flash of white light.
p94
aVSix is a tiny and very sad black hole.
p95
aVThe sketches are in black and white here,
p96
aVbut in my mind they have colors.
p97
aVThree is green.
p98
aVFour is blue.
p99
aVFive is yellow.
p100
aa(lp101
VI paint as well.
p102
aVAnd here is one of my paintings.
p103
aVIt's a multiplication of two prime numbers.
p104
aVThree-dimensional shapes
p105
aVand the space they create in the middle
p106
aVcreates a new shape,
p107
aVthe answer to the sum.
p108
aVWhat about bigger numbers?
p109
aVWell you can't get much bigger than Pi,
p110
aVthe mathematical constant.
p111
aVIt's an infinite number \u2014
p112
aVliterally goes on forever.
p113
aVIn this painting that I made
p114
aVof the first 20 decimals of Pi,
p115
aVI take the colors
p116
aVand the emotions and the textures
p117
aVand I pull them all together
p118
aVinto a kind of rolling numerical landscape.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut it's not only numbers that I see in colors.
p121
aVWords too, for me,
p122
aVhave colors and emotions
p123
aVand textures.
p124
aVAnd this is an opening phrase
p125
aVfrom the novel "Lolita."
p126
aVAnd Nabokov was himself synesthetic.
p127
aVAnd you can see here
p128
aVhow my perception of the sound L
p129
aVhelps the alliteration
p130
aVto jump right out.
p131
aVAnother example:
p132
aVa little bit more mathematical.
p133
aVAnd I wonder if some of you will notice
p134
aVthe construction of the sentence
p135
aVfrom "The Great Gatsby."
p136
aVThere is a procession of syllables \u2014
p137
aVwheat, one;
p138
aVprairies, two;
p139
aVlost Swede towns, three \u2014
p140
aVone, two, three.
p141
aVAnd this effect is very pleasant on the mind,
p142
aVand it helps the sentence
p143
aVto feel right.
p144
aa(lp145
VLet's go back to the questions
p146
aVI posed you a moment ago.
p147
aV64 multiplied by 75.
p148
aVIf some of you play chess,
p149
aVyou'll know that 64
p150
aVis a square number,
p151
aVand that's why chessboards,
p152
aVeight by eight,
p153
aVhave 64 squares.
p154
aVSo that gives us a form
p155
aVthat we can picture, that we can perceive.
p156
aVWhat about 75?
p157
aVWell if 100,
p158
aVif we think of 100 as being like a square,
p159
aV75 would look like this.
p160
aVSo what we need to do now
p161
aVis put those two pictures
p162
aVtogether in our mind \u2014
p163
aVsomething like this.
p164
aV64 becomes 6,400.
p165
aVAnd in the right-hand corner,
p166
aVyou don't have to calculate anything.
p167
aVFour across, four up and down \u2014
p168
aVit's 16.
p169
aVSo what the sum is actually asking you to do
p170
aVis 16,
p171
aV16, 16.
p172
aVThat's a lot easier
p173
aVthan the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.
p174
aVIt's 16, 16, 16, 48,
p175
aV4,800 \u2014
p176
aV4,800,
p177
aVthe answer to the sum.
p178
aVEasy when you know how.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VThe second question was an Icelandic word.
p183
aVI'm assuming there are not many people here
p184
aVwho speak Icelandic.
p185
aVSo let me narrow the choices down to two.
p186
aVHnugginn:
p187
aVis it a happy word,
p188
aVor a sad word?
p189
aVWhat do you say?
p190
aVOkay.
p191
aVSome people say it's happy.
p192
aVMost people, a majority of people,
p193
aVsay sad.
p194
aVAnd it actually means sad.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVWhy do, statistically,
p197
aVa majority of people
p198
aVsay that a word is sad, in this case,
p199
aVheavy in other cases?
p200
aVIn my theory, language evolves in such a way
p201
aVthat sounds match,
p202
aVcorrespond with, the subjective,
p203
aVwith the personal,
p204
aVintuitive experience
p205
aVof the listener.
p206
aa(lp207
VLet's have a look at the third question.
p208
aVIt's a line from a poem by John Keats.
p209
aVWords, like numbers,
p210
aVexpress fundamental relationships
p211
aVbetween objects
p212
aVand events and forces
p213
aVthat constitute our world.
p214
aVIt stands to reason that we, existing in this world,
p215
aVshould in the course of our lives
p216
aVabsorb intuitively those relationships.
p217
aVAnd poets, like other artists,
p218
aVplay with those intuitive understandings.
p219
aVIn the case of hare,
p220
aVit's an ambiguous sound in English.
p221
aVIt can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.
p222
aVAnd if we think of that \u2014
p223
aVlet me put the picture up \u2014
p224
aVthe fibers represent vulnerability.
p225
aVThey yield to the slightest movement
p226
aVor motion or emotion.
p227
aVSo what you have is an atmosphere
p228
aVof vulnerability and tension.
p229
aVThe hare itself, the animal \u2014
p230
aVnot a cat, not a dog, a hare \u2014
p231
aVwhy a hare?
p232
aVBecause think of the picture \u2014
p233
aVnot the word, the picture.
p234
aVThe overlong ears,
p235
aVthe overlarge feet,
p236
aVhelps us to picture, to feel intuitively,
p237
aVwhat it means to limp
p238
aVand to tremble.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo in these few minutes,
p241
aVI hope I've been able to share
p242
aVa little bit of my vision of things
p243
aVand to show you
p244
aVthat words can have colors and emotions,
p245
aVnumbers, shapes and personalities.
p246
aVThe world is richer,
p247
aVvaster
p248
aVthan it too often seems to be.
p249
aVI hope that I've given you the desire
p250
aVto learn to see the world with new eyes.
p251
aa(lp252
VThank you.
