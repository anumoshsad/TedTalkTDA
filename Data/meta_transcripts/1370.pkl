VI'm a computer science professor,
p4
aVand my area of expertise is
p5
aVcomputer and information security.
p6
aVWhen I was in graduate school,
p7
aVI had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother
p8
aVdescribing to one of her fellow senior citizens
p9
aVwhat I did for a living.
p10
aVApparently, I was in charge of making sure that
p11
aVno one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter)
p12
aVAnd, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing
p13
aVfor her to think, because I told her I was working
p14
aVin computer security,
p15
aVand it was interesting to get her perspective.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard
p18
aVanyone say about my work.
p19
aVThe most ridiculous thing I ever heard is,
p20
aVI was at a dinner party, and a woman heard
p21
aVthat I work in computer security,
p22
aVand she asked me if \u2014 she said her computer had been
p23
aVinfected by a virus, and she was very concerned that she
p24
aVmight get sick from it, that she could get this virus. (Laughter)
p25
aVAnd I'm not a doctor, but I reassured her
p26
aVthat it was very, very unlikely that this would happen,
p27
aVbut if she felt more comfortable, she could be free to use
p28
aVlatex gloves when she was on the computer,
p29
aVand there would be no harm whatsoever in that.
p30
aa(lp31
VI'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get
p32
aVa virus from your computer, in a serious way.
p33
aVWhat I'm going to talk to you about today
p34
aVare some hacks, some real world cyberattacks that people
p35
aVin my community, the academic research community,
p36
aVhave performed, which I don't think
p37
aVmost people know about,
p38
aVand I think they're very interesting and scary,
p39
aVand this talk is kind of a greatest hits
p40
aVof the academic security community's hacks.
p41
aVNone of the work is my work. It's all work
p42
aVthat my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them
p43
aVfor their slides and incorporated them into this talk.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo the first one I'm going to talk about
p46
aVare implanted medical devices.
p47
aVNow medical devices have come a long way technologically.
p48
aVYou can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.
p49
aV1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,
p50
aVhopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,
p51
aVand the technology has continued to move forward.
p52
aVIn 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective
p53
aVof computer security.
p54
aVAnd why do I say that?
p55
aVBecause that's when implanted devices inside of people
p56
aVstarted to have networking capabilities.
p57
aVOne thing that brings us close to home is we look
p58
aVat Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that
p59
aVpumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,
p60
aVand as you can see at the bottom there,
p61
aVit was controlled by a computer controller,
p62
aVand if you ever thought that software liability
p63
aVwas very important, get one of these inside of you.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow what a research team did was they got their hands
p66
aVon what's called an ICD.
p67
aVThis is a defibrillator, and this is a device
p68
aVthat goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,
p69
aVand these have saved many lives.
p70
aVWell, in order to not have to open up the person
p71
aVevery time you want to reprogram their device
p72
aVor do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able
p73
aVto communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did
p74
aVis they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,
p75
aVand they built the device you see pictured here,
p76
aVwith a little antenna, that could talk the protocol
p77
aVto the device, and thus control it.
p78
aVIn order to make their experience real \u2014 they were unable
p79
aVto find any volunteers, and so they went
p80
aVand they got some ground beef and some bacon
p81
aVand they wrapped it all up to about the size
p82
aVof a human being's area where the device would go,
p83
aVand they stuck the device inside it
p84
aVto perform their experiment somewhat realistically.
p85
aVThey launched many, many successful attacks.
p86
aVOne that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.
p87
aVI don't know why you would want to do that,
p88
aVbut I sure wouldn't want that done to me.
p89
aVAnd they were able to change therapies,
p90
aVincluding disabling the device \u2014 and this is with a real,
p91
aVcommercial, off-the-shelf device \u2014
p92
aVsimply by performing reverse engineering and sending
p93
aVwireless signals to it.
p94
aa(lp95
VThere was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs
p96
aVcould actually have their performance disrupted
p97
aVsimply by holding a pair of headphones onto them.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, wireless and the Internet
p100
aVcan improve health care greatly.
p101
aVThere's several examples up on the screen
p102
aVof situations where doctors are looking to implant devices
p103
aVinside of people, and all of these devices now,
p104
aVit's standard that they communicate wirelessly,
p105
aVand I think this is great,
p106
aVbut without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,
p107
aVand without understanding what attackers can do
p108
aVand the security risks from the beginning,
p109
aVthere's a lot of danger in this.
p110
aa(lp111
VOkay, let me shift gears and show you another target.
p112
aVI'm going to show you a few different targets like this,
p113
aVand that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is a car, and it has a lot of components,
p116
aVa lot of electronics in it today.
p117
aVIn fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,
p118
aVmore Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college,
p119
aVand they're connected by a wired network.
p120
aVThere's also a wireless network in the car,
p121
aVwhich can be reached from many different ways.
p122
aVSo there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,
p123
aVthere's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels
p124
aVthat wirelessly communicate the tire pressure
p125
aVto a controller on board.
p126
aVThe modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?
p129
aVWell, that's what the researchers
p130
aVthat I'm going to talk about today did.
p131
aVThey basically stuck an attacker on the wired network
p132
aVand on the wireless network.
p133
aVNow, they have two areas they can attack.
p134
aVOne is short-range wireless, where you can actually
p135
aVcommunicate with the device from nearby,
p136
aVeither through Bluetooth or wi-fi,
p137
aVand the other is long-range, where you can communicate
p138
aVwith the car through the cellular network,
p139
aVor through one of the radio stations.
p140
aVThink about it. When a car receives a radio signal,
p141
aVit's processed by software.
p142
aVThat software has to receive and decode the radio signal,
p143
aVand then figure out what to do with it,
p144
aVeven if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio,
p145
aVand that software that does that decoding,
p146
aVif it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability
p147
aVfor somebody to hack the car.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe way that the researchers did this work is,
p150
aVthey read the software in the computer chips
p151
aVthat were in the car, and then they used sophisticated
p152
aVreverse engineering tools
p153
aVto figure out what that software did,
p154
aVand then they found vulnerabilities in that software,
p155
aVand then they built exploits to exploit those.
p156
aVThey actually carried out their attack in real life.
p157
aVThey bought two cars, and I guess
p158
aVthey have better budgets than I do.
p159
aVThe first threat model was to see what someone could do
p160
aVif an attacker actually got access
p161
aVto the internal network on the car.
p162
aVOkay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car,
p163
aVthey get to mess around with it, and then they leave,
p164
aVand now, what kind of trouble are you in?
p165
aVThe other threat model is that they contact you
p166
aVin real time over one of the wireless networks
p167
aVlike the cellular, or something like that,
p168
aVnever having actually gotten physical access to your car.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is what their setup looks like for the first model,
p171
aVwhere you get to have access to the car.
p172
aVThey put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit
p173
aVon the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,
p174
aVlike here's a picture of the speedometer
p175
aVshowing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.
p176
aVOnce you have control of the car's computers,
p177
aVyou can do anything.
p178
aVNow you might say, "Okay, that's silly."
p179
aVWell, what if you make the car always say
p180
aVit's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?
p181
aVYou might produce a lot of speeding tickets.
p182
aa(lp183
VThen they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,
p184
aVthe target victim car and the chase car,
p185
aVand they launched a bunch of other attacks.
p186
aVOne of the things they were able to do from the chase car
p187
aVis apply the brakes on the other car,
p188
aVsimply by hacking the computer.
p189
aVThey were able to disable the brakes.
p190
aVThey also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in
p191
aVand wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like
p192
aVgoing over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.
p193
aVThe results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,
p194
aVeven though they gave this talk at a conference
p195
aVto a bunch of computer security researchers,
p196
aVeverybody was gasping.
p197
aVThey were able to take over a bunch of critical computers
p198
aVinside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer,
p199
aVthe engine, the dash, the radio, etc.,
p200
aVand they were able to perform these on real commercial
p201
aVcars that they purchased using the radio network.
p202
aVThey were able to compromise every single one of the
p203
aVpieces of software that controlled every single one
p204
aVof the wireless capabilities of the car.
p205
aVAll of these were implemented successfully.
p206
aa(lp207
VHow would you steal a car in this model?
p208
aVWell, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow
p209
aVof vulnerability in the software, something like that.
p210
aVYou use the GPS in the car to locate it.
p211
aVYou remotely unlock the doors through the computer
p212
aVthat controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,
p213
aVand you've got yourself a car.
p214
aa(lp215
VSurveillance was really interesting.
p216
aVThe authors of the study have a video where they show
p217
aVthemselves taking over a car and then turning on
p218
aVthe microphone in the car, and listening in on the car
p219
aVwhile tracking it via GPS on a map,
p220
aVand so that's something that the drivers of the car
p221
aVwould never know was happening.
p222
aa(lp223
VAm I scaring you yet?
p224
aVI've got a few more of these interesting ones.
p225
aVThese are ones where I went to a conference,
p226
aVand my mind was just blown, and I said,
p227
aV"I have to share this with other people."
p228
aa(lp229
VThis was Fabian Monrose's lab
p230
aVat the University of North Carolina, and what they did was
p231
aVsomething intuitive once you see it,
p232
aVbut kind of surprising.
p233
aVThey videotaped people on a bus,
p234
aVand then they post-processed the video.
p235
aVWhat you see here in number one is a
p236
aVreflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone
p237
aVthat they're typing in.
p238
aVThey wrote software to stabilize \u2014
p239
aVeven though they were on a bus
p240
aVand maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle \u2014
p241
aVto stabilize the phone, process it, and
p242
aVyou may know on your smartphone, when you type
p243
aVa password, the keys pop out a little bit, and they were able
p244
aVto use that to reconstruct what the person was typing,
p245
aVand had a language model for detecting typing.
p246
aVWhat was interesting is, by videotaping on a bus,
p247
aVthey were able to produce exactly what people
p248
aVon their smartphones were typing,
p249
aVand then they had a surprising result, which is that
p250
aVtheir software had not only done it for their target,
p251
aVbut other people who accidentally happened
p252
aVto be in the picture, they were able to produce
p253
aVwhat those people had been typing, and that was kind of
p254
aVan accidental artifact of what their software was doing.
p255
aa(lp256
VI'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.
p257
aVP25 radios are used by law enforcement
p258
aVand all kinds of government agencies
p259
aVand people in combat to communicate,
p260
aVand there's an encryption option on these phones.
p261
aVThis is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.
p262
aVIt's more of a two-way radio.
p263
aVMotorola makes the most widely used one, and you can see
p264
aVthat they're used by Secret Service, they're used in combat,
p265
aVit's a very, very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere.
p266
aVSo one question the researchers asked themselves is,
p267
aVcould you block this thing, right?
p268
aVCould you run a denial-of-service,
p269
aVbecause these are first responders?
p270
aVSo, would a terrorist organization want to black out the
p271
aVability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency?
p272
aVThey found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting
p273
aVthat happens to operate at the same exact frequency
p274
aVas the P25, and they built what they called
p275
aVMy First Jammer. (Laughter)
p276
aVIf you look closely at this device,
p277
aVit's got a switch for encryption or cleartext.
p278
aVLet me advance the slide, and now I'll go back.
p279
aVYou see the difference?
p280
aVThis is plain text. This is encrypted.
p281
aVThere's one little dot that shows up on the screen,
p282
aVand one little tiny turn of the switch.
p283
aVAnd so the researchers asked themselves, "I wonder how
p284
aVmany times very secure, important, sensitive conversations
p285
aVare happening on these two-way radios where they forget
p286
aVto encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt?"
p287
aa(lp288
VSo they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal
p289
aVand they run at the frequency of the P25,
p290
aVand what they did is they hopped around frequencies
p291
aVand they wrote software to listen in.
p292
aVIf they found encrypted communication, they stayed
p293
aVon that channel and they wrote down, that's a channel
p294
aVthat these people communicate in,
p295
aVthese law enforcement agencies,
p296
aVand they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in
p297
aVon conversations that were happening at those frequencies.
p298
aVThey found that in every metropolitan area,
p299
aVthey would capture over 20 minutes a day
p300
aVof cleartext communication.
p301
aVAnd what kind of things were people talking about?
p302
aVWell, they found the names and information
p303
aVabout confidential informants. They found information
p304
aVthat was being recorded in wiretaps,
p305
aVa bunch of crimes that were being discussed,
p306
aVsensitive information.
p307
aVIt was mostly law enforcement and criminal.
p308
aVThey went and reported this to the law enforcement
p309
aVagencies, after anonymizing it,
p310
aVand the vulnerability here is simply the user interface
p311
aVwasn't good enough. If you're talking
p312
aVabout something really secure and sensitive, it should
p313
aVbe really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.
p314
aVThat one's pretty easy to fix.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe last one I thought was really, really cool,
p317
aVand I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something
p318
aVthat you're going to lose sleep over
p319
aVlike the cars or the defibrillators,
p320
aVbut it's stealing keystrokes.
p321
aVNow, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.
p322
aVEvery security expert wants to hack a smartphone,
p323
aVand we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,
p324
aVthe camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point
p325
aVhad looked at the accelerometer.
p326
aVThe accelerometer is the thing that determines
p327
aVthe vertical orientation of the smartphone.
p328
aVAnd so they had a simple setup.
p329
aVThey put a smartphone next to a keyboard,
p330
aVand they had people type, and then their goal was
p331
aVto use the vibrations that were created by typing
p332
aVto measure the change in the accelerometer reading
p333
aVto determine what the person had been typing.
p334
aVNow, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,
p335
aVthis is a graph of the perturbations that were created
p336
aVby the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult
p337
aVto tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,
p338
aVbut the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,
p339
aVand so the same measurement
p340
aVproduced this graph.
p341
aVNow that gave you a lot of information while someone
p342
aVwas typing, and what they did then is used advanced
p343
aVartificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
p344
aVto have a training phase,
p345
aVand so they got most likely grad students
p346
aVto type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,
p347
aVto have the system use the machine learning tools that
p348
aVwere available to learn what it is that the people were typing
p349
aVand to match that up
p350
aVwith the measurements in the accelerometer.
p351
aVAnd then there's the attack phase, where you get
p352
aVsomebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,
p353
aVbut you use your model that you created
p354
aVin the training phase to figure out what they were typing.
p355
aVThey had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.
p356
aVThey typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled
p357
aVthat Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago"
p358
aV\u2014 see, I tied it in to the last talk \u2014
p359
aV"and ordered him to stay on the ballot."
p360
aVNow, the system is interesting, because it produced
p361
aV"Illinois Supreme" and then it wasn't sure.
p362
aVThe model produced a bunch of options,
p363
aVand this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,
p364
aVis that computers are good at some things,
p365
aVhumans are good at other things,
p366
aVtake the best of both and let the humans solve this one.
p367
aVDon't waste computer cycles.
p368
aVA human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.
p369
aVIt's the Supreme Court, right?
p370
aVAnd so, together we're able to reproduce typing
p371
aVsimply by measuring the accelerometer.
p372
aVWhy does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,
p373
aVfor example, the developers have a manifest
p374
aVwhere every device on there, the microphone, etc.,
p375
aVhas to register if you're going to use it
p376
aVso that hackers can't take over it,
p377
aVbut nobody controls the accelerometer.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to
p380
aVsomeone's keyboard, and just leave the room,
p381
aVand then later recover what they did,
p382
aVeven without using the microphone.
p383
aVIf someone is able to put malware on your iPhone,
p384
aVthey could then maybe get the typing that you do
p385
aVwhenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard.
p386
aa(lp387
VThere's several other notable attacks that unfortunately
p388
aVI don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted
p389
aVto point out was a group from the University of Michigan
p390
aVwhich was able to take voting machines,
p391
aVthe Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that
p392
aVwere going to be used in New Jersey in the election
p393
aVthat were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it.
p394
aVSo they ran the Pac-Man game.
p395
aa(lp396
VWhat does this all mean?
p397
aVWell, I think that society tends to adopt technology
p398
aVreally quickly. I love the next coolest gadget.
p399
aVBut it's very important, and these researchers are showing,
p400
aVthat the developers of these things
p401
aVneed to take security into account from the very beginning,
p402
aVand need to realize that they may have a threat model,
p403
aVbut the attackers may not be nice enough
p404
aVto limit themselves to that threat model,
p405
aVand so you need to think outside of the box.
p406
aa(lp407
VWhat we can do is be aware
p408
aVthat devices can be compromised,
p409
aVand anything that has software in it
p410
aVis going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs.
p411
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
