VThe filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.
p4
aVNow movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.
p5
aVWith complete control of everything the audience can see,
p6
aVmoviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques
p7
aVto further their deceptions.
p8
aa(lp9
VMotion pictures are themselves an illusion of life,
p10
aVproduced by the sequential projection of still frames,
p11
aVand they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.
p12
aVEven today's sophisticated moviegoers
p13
aVstill lose themselves to the screen,
p14
aVand filmmakers leverage this separation from reality
p15
aVto great effect.
p16
aVNow imaginative people have been having fun with this
p17
aVfor over 400 years.
p18
aVGiambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar
p19
aVin the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world
p20
aVand saw how it could be manipulated.
p21
aVPlaying with the world, and our perception of it,
p22
aVreally is the essence of visual effects.
p23
aVSo digging deeper into this
p24
aVwith the Science and Technology Council
p25
aVof the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
p26
aVreveals some truth behind the trickery.
p27
aa(lp28
VVisual effects are based on the principles of all illusions:
p29
aVassumption, things are as we know them;
p30
aVpresumption, things will behave as we expect;
p31
aVand context in reality,
p32
aVour knowledge of the world as we know it,
p33
aVsuch as scale.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow a fourth factor really becomes an obsession,
p36
aVwhich is, never betray the illusion.
p37
aVAnd that last point has made visual effects
p38
aVa constant quest for perfection.
p39
aVSo from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema
p40
aVto last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps
p41
aVand a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.
p42
aVI hope you will enjoy.
