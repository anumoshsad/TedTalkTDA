VThis room may appear
p4
aVto be holding 600 people,
p5
aVbut there's actually so many more,
p6
aVbecause in each one of us
p7
aVthere is a multitude of personalities.
p8
aVI have two primary personalities
p9
aVthat have been in conflict and conversation within me
p10
aVsince I was a little girl.
p11
aVI call them "the mystic"
p12
aVand "the warrior."
p13
aVI was born into a family
p14
aVof politically active,
p15
aVintellectual atheists.
p16
aVThere was this equation in my family that went something like this:
p17
aVif you are intelligent,
p18
aVyou therefore are not spiritual.
p19
aVI was the freak of the family.
p20
aVI was this weird little kid
p21
aVwho wanted to have deep talks
p22
aVabout the worlds that might exist
p23
aVbeyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.
p24
aVI wanted to know
p25
aVif what we human beings see
p26
aVand hear and think
p27
aVis a full and accurate picture
p28
aVof reality.
p29
aVSo, looking for answers,
p30
aVI went to Catholic mass.
p31
aVI tagged along with my neighbors.
p32
aVI read Sartre and Socrates.
p33
aVAnd then a wonderful thing happened
p34
aVwhen I was in high school:
p35
aVGurus from the East
p36
aVstarted washing up on the shores of America.
p37
aVAnd I said to myself,
p38
aV"I wanna get me one of them."
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd ever since,
p41
aVI've been walking the mystic path,
p42
aVtrying to peer beyond
p43
aVwhat Albert Einstein called
p44
aV"the optical delusion
p45
aVof everyday consciousness."
p46
aVSo what did he mean by this? I'll show you.
p47
aVTake a breath right now
p48
aVof this clear air in this room.
p49
aVNow, see this strange,
p50
aVunderwater,
p51
aVcoral reef-looking thing?
p52
aVIt's actually a person's trachea,
p53
aVand those colored globs
p54
aVare microbes
p55
aVthat are actually swimming around in this room
p56
aVright now, all around us.
p57
aVIf we're blind to this simple biology,
p58
aVimagine what we're missing
p59
aVat the smallest subatomic level right now
p60
aVand at the grandest cosmic levels.
p61
aVMy years as a mystic
p62
aVhave made me question
p63
aValmost all my assumptions.
p64
aVThey've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow when the mystic part of me
p67
aVjabbers on and on like this,
p68
aVthe warrior rolls her eyes.
p69
aVShe's concerned
p70
aVabout what's happening in this world right now.
p71
aVShe's worried.
p72
aVShe says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,
p73
aVand I know a few things,
p74
aVand we better get busy about them right now."
p75
aVI've spent my life as a warrior,
p76
aVworking for women's issues,
p77
aVworking on political campaigns,
p78
aVbeing an activist for the environment.
p79
aVAnd it can be sort of crazy-making,
p80
aVhousing both the mystic and the warrior
p81
aVin one body.
p82
aVI've always been attracted
p83
aVto those rare people
p84
aVwho pull that off,
p85
aVwho devote their lives to humanity
p86
aVwith the grit of the warrior
p87
aVand the grace of the mystic \u2014
p88
aVpeople like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
p89
aVwho wrote, "I can never be
p90
aVwhat I ought to be
p91
aVuntil you are
p92
aVwhat you ought to be.
p93
aVThis," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure
p94
aVof reality."
p95
aVThen Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior,
p96
aVwho said, "The problem with the world
p97
aVis that we draw the circle of our family
p98
aVtoo small."
p99
aVAnd Nelson Mandela,
p100
aVwho lives by the African concept
p101
aVof "ubuntu,"
p102
aVwhich means "I need you
p103
aVin order to be me,
p104
aVand you need me in order to be you."
p105
aVNow we all love to trot out
p106
aVthese three mystic warriors
p107
aVas if they were born
p108
aVwith the saint gene.
p109
aVBut we all actually have
p110
aVthe same capacity that they do,
p111
aVand we need to do
p112
aVtheir work now.
p113
aa(lp114
VI'm deeply disturbed
p115
aVby the ways in which all of our cultures
p116
aVare demonizing "the Other"
p117
aVby the voice we're giving
p118
aVto the most divisive among us.
p119
aVListen to these titles
p120
aVof some of the bestselling books
p121
aVfrom both sides of the political divide
p122
aVhere in the U.S.
p123
aV"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,"
p124
aV"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,"
p125
aV"Pinheads and Patriots,"
p126
aV"Arguing With Idiots."
p127
aVThey're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,
p128
aVbut they're actually dangerous.
p129
aVNow here's a title that may sound familiar,
p130
aVbut whose author may surprise you:
p131
aV"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle
p132
aVAgainst Lies, Stupidity
p133
aVand Cowardice."
p134
aVWho wrote that?
p135
aVThat was Adolf Hitler's first title
p136
aVfor "Mein Kampf" \u2014 "My Struggle" \u2014
p137
aVthe book that launched the Nazi party.
p138
aVThe worst eras in human history,
p139
aVwhether in Cambodia or Germany
p140
aVor Rwanda,
p141
aVthey start like this, with negative other-izing.
p142
aVAnd then they morph
p143
aVinto violent extremism.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is why I'm launching a new initiative.
p146
aVAnd it's to help all of us,
p147
aVmyself included,
p148
aVto counteract the tendency
p149
aVto "otherize."
p150
aVAnd I realize we're all busy people,
p151
aVso don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.
p152
aVI'm calling my initiative,
p153
aV"Take the Other to Lunch."
p154
aVIf you are
p155
aVa Republican,
p156
aVyou can take a Democrat to lunch,
p157
aVor if you're a Democrat,
p158
aVthink of it
p159
aVas taking a Republican to lunch.
p160
aVNow if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch
p161
aVmakes you lose your appetite,
p162
aVI suggest you start more local,
p163
aVbecause there is no shortage of the Other
p164
aVright in your own neighborhood.
p165
aVMaybe that person
p166
aVwho worships at the mosque,
p167
aVor the church or the synagogue, down the street.
p168
aVOr someone from the other side
p169
aVof the abortion conflict.
p170
aVOr maybe your brother-in-law
p171
aVwho doesn't believe in global warming.
p172
aVAnyone whose lifestyle may frighten you,
p173
aVor whose point of view
p174
aVmakes smoke come out of your ears.
p175
aa(lp176
VA couple of weeks ago,
p177
aVI took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.
p178
aVNow on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.
p179
aVShe's an activist from the Right,
p180
aVand I'm an activist from the Left.
p181
aVAnd we used some guidelines
p182
aVto keep our conversation elevated,
p183
aVand you can use them too,
p184
aVbecause I know you're all going
p185
aVto take an Other to lunch.
p186
aVSo first of all, decide on a goal:
p187
aVto get to know one person
p188
aVfrom a group you may have negatively stereotyped.
p189
aVAnd then, before you get together,
p190
aVagree on some ground rules.
p191
aVMy Tea Party lunchmate and I
p192
aVcame up with these:
p193
aVdon't persuade, defend
p194
aVor interrupt.
p195
aVBe curious;
p196
aVbe conversational; be real.
p197
aVAnd listen.
p198
aa(lp199
VFrom there, we dove in.
p200
aVAnd we used these questions:
p201
aVShare some of your life experiences with me.
p202
aVWhat issues
p203
aVdeeply concern you?
p204
aVAnd what have you always wanted to ask
p205
aVsomeone from the other side?
p206
aVMy lunch partner and I
p207
aVcame away with some really important insights,
p208
aVand I'm going to share just one with you.
p209
aVI think it has relevance
p210
aVto any problem
p211
aVbetween people anywhere.
p212
aVI asked her why her side
p213
aVmakes such outrageous allegations
p214
aVand lies about my side.
p215
aV"What?" she wanted to know.
p216
aV"Like we're a bunch
p217
aVof elitist,
p218
aVmorally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."
p219
aVWell, she was shocked.
p220
aVShe thought my side
p221
aVbeat up on her side way more often,
p222
aVthat we called them brainless,
p223
aVgun-toting racists,
p224
aVand we both marveled
p225
aVat the labels that fit
p226
aVnone of the people
p227
aVwe actually know.
p228
aVAnd since we had established some trust,
p229
aVwe believed in each other's sincerity.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe agreed we'd speak up in our own communities
p232
aVwhen we witnessed
p233
aVthe kind of "otherizing" talk
p234
aVthat can wound
p235
aVand fester into paranoia
p236
aVand then be used by those on the fringes
p237
aVto incite.
p238
aVBy the end of our lunch,
p239
aVwe acknowledged each other's openness.
p240
aVNeither of us had tried to change the other.
p241
aVBut we also hadn't pretended
p242
aVthat our differences were just going to melt away
p243
aVafter a lunch.
p244
aVInstead, we had taken
p245
aVfirst steps together,
p246
aVpast our knee-jerk reactions,
p247
aVto the ubuntu place,
p248
aVwhich is the only place
p249
aVwhere solutions
p250
aVto our most intractable-seeming problems
p251
aVwill be found.
p252
aa(lp253
VWho should you invite to lunch?
p254
aVNext time you catch yourself
p255
aVin the act of otherizing,
p256
aVthat will be your clue.
p257
aVAnd what might happen at your lunch?
p258
aVWill the heavens open
p259
aVand "We Are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?
p260
aVProbably not.
p261
aVBecause ubuntu work is slow,
p262
aVand it's difficult.
p263
aVIt's two people
p264
aVdropping the pretense
p265
aVof being know-it-alls.
p266
aVIt's two people,
p267
aVtwo warriors,
p268
aVdropping their weapons
p269
aVand reaching toward each other.
p270
aVHere's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:
p271
aV"Out beyond ideas
p272
aVof wrong-doing and right-doing,
p273
aVthere is a field.
p274
aVI'll meet you there."
