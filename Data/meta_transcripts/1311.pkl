VI've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.
p4
aVI work for the Red Cross
p5
aVand I'm a physical therapist.
p6
aVMy job is to make arms and legs \u2014
p7
aVwell it's not completely true.
p8
aVWe do more than that.
p9
aVWe provide the patients,
p10
aVthe Afghan disabled,
p11
aVfirst with the physical rehabilitation
p12
aVthen with the social reintegration.
p13
aVIt's a very logical plan,
p14
aVbut it was not always like this.
p15
aVFor many years, we were just providing them
p16
aVwith artificial limbs.
p17
aVIt took quite many years
p18
aVfor the program to become what it is now.
p19
aa(lp20
VToday, I would like to tell you a story,
p21
aVthe story of a big change,
p22
aVand the story of the people
p23
aVwho made this change possible.
p24
aVI arrived in Afghanistan
p25
aVin 1990
p26
aVto work in a hospital
p27
aVfor war victims.
p28
aVAnd then, not only for war victims,
p29
aVbut it was for any kind of patient.
p30
aVI was also working
p31
aVin the orthopedic center, we call it.
p32
aVThis is the place where we make the legs.
p33
aVAt that time
p34
aVI found myself
p35
aVin a strange situation.
p36
aVI felt not quite ready
p37
aVfor that job.
p38
aVThere was so much to learn.
p39
aVThere were so many things new to me.
p40
aVBut it was a terrific job.
p41
aVBut as soon as the fighting intensified,
p42
aVthe physical rehabilitation was suspended.
p43
aVThere were many other things to do.
p44
aVSo the orthopedic center was closed
p45
aVbecause physical rehabilitation
p46
aVwas not considered a priority.
p47
aVIt was a strange sensation.
p48
aVAnyway, you know every time I make this speech \u2014
p49
aVit's not the first time \u2014 but it's an emotion.
p50
aVIt's something that comes out from the past.
p51
aVIt's 21 years,
p52
aVbut they are still all there.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnyway, in 1992,
p55
aVthe Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.
p56
aVAnd the orthopedic center was closed.
p57
aVI was assigned to work for the homeless,
p58
aVfor the internally displaced people.
p59
aVBut one day, something happened.
p60
aVI was coming back
p61
aVfrom a big food distribution in a mosque
p62
aVwhere tens and tens of people
p63
aVwere squatting in terrible conditions.
p64
aVI wanted to go home. I was driving.
p65
aVYou know, when you want to forget,
p66
aVyou don't want to see things,
p67
aVso you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside
p68
aVand say, "That's enough."
p69
aVA bomb fell not far from my car \u2014
p70
aVwell, far enough, but big noise.
p71
aVAnd everybody disappeared from the street.
p72
aVThe cars disappeared as well.
p73
aVI ducked.
p74
aVAnd only one figure
p75
aVremained in the middle of the road.
p76
aVIt was a man in a wheelchair
p77
aVdesperately trying to move away.
p78
aa(lp79
VWell I'm not a particularly brave person,
p80
aVI have to confess it,
p81
aVbut I could not just ignore him.
p82
aVSo I stopped the car
p83
aVand I went to help.
p84
aVThe man was without legs
p85
aVand only with one arm.
p86
aVBehind him there was a child, his son,
p87
aVred in the face
p88
aVin an effort to push the father.
p89
aVSo I took him into a safe place.
p90
aVAnd I ask, "What are you doing out in the street
p91
aVin this situation?"
p92
aV"I work," he said.
p93
aVI wondered, what work?
p94
aVAnd then I ask an even more stupid question:
p95
aV"Why don't you have the prostheses?
p96
aVWhy don't you have the artificial legs?"
p97
aVAnd he said, "The Red Cross has closed."
p98
aVWell without thinking, I told him
p99
aV"Come tomorrow.
p100
aVWe will provide you with a pair of legs."
p101
aVThe man, his name was Mahmoud,
p102
aVand the child, whose name was Rafi, left.
p103
aVAnd then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?
p104
aVThe center is closed,
p105
aVno staff around.
p106
aVMaybe the machinery is broken.
p107
aVWho is going to make the legs for him?"
p108
aVSo I hoped that he would not come.
p109
aVThis is the streets of Kabul
p110
aVin those days.
p111
aVSo I said, "Well I will give him some money."
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so the following day,
p114
aVI went to the orthopedic center.
p115
aVAnd I spoke with a gatekeeper.
p116
aVI was ready to tell him,
p117
aV"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,
p118
aVplease tell him that it was a mistake.
p119
aVNothing can be done.
p120
aVGive him some money."
p121
aVBut Mahmoud and his son were already there.
p122
aVAnd they were not alone.
p123
aVThere were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.
p124
aVAnd there was some staff too.
p125
aVAmong them there was my right-hand man,
p126
aVNajmuddin.
p127
aVAnd the gatekeeper told me,
p128
aV"They come everyday to see if the center will open."
p129
aVI said, "No.
p130
aVWe have to go away. We cannot stay here."
p131
aVThey were bombing \u2014 not very close \u2014 but you could hear the noise of the bombs.
p132
aVSo, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.
p133
aVIt's not a priority."
p134
aVBut Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."
p135
aVAt least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people
p136
aVand maybe try to do something
p137
aVfor people like Mahmoud."
p138
aVI said, "No, please. We cannot do that.
p139
aVIt's really dangerous.
p140
aVWe have other things to do."
p141
aVBut they insisted.
p142
aVWhen you have 20 people
p143
aVin front of you, looking at you
p144
aVand you are the one who has to decide ...
p145
aa(lp146
VSo we started doing some repairs.
p147
aVAlso one of the physical therapists
p148
aVreported that Mahmoud
p149
aVcould be provided with a leg,
p150
aVbut not immediately.
p151
aVThe legs were swollen
p152
aVand the knees were stiff,
p153
aVso he needed a long preparation.
p154
aVBelieve me, I was worried
p155
aVbecause I was breaking the rules.
p156
aVI was doing something
p157
aVthat I was not supposed to do.
p158
aVIn the evening,
p159
aVI went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,
p160
aVand I told them \u2014 I lied \u2014
p161
aVI told them, "Listen, we are going to start
p162
aVa couple of hours per day,
p163
aVjust a few repairs."
p164
aVMaybe some of them are here now.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VSo we started.
p169
aVI was working, I was going everyday
p170
aVto work for the homeless.
p171
aVAnd Najmuddin was staying there,
p172
aVdoing everything and reporting on the patients.
p173
aVHe was telling me, "Patients are coming."
p174
aVWe knew that many more patients
p175
aVcould not come, prevented by the fighting.
p176
aVBut people were coming.
p177
aVAnd Mahmoud was coming every day.
p178
aVAnd slowly, slowly
p179
aVweek after week
p180
aVhis legs were improving.
p181
aVThe stump or cast prosthesis was made,
p182
aVand he was starting
p183
aVthe real physical rehabilitation.
p184
aVHe was coming every day,
p185
aVcrossing the front line.
p186
aVA couple of times I crossed the front line
p187
aVin the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.
p188
aVI tell you, it was something so sinister
p189
aVthat I was astonished he could do it every day.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut finally, the great day arrived.
p192
aVMahmoud was going to be discharged
p193
aVwith his new legs.
p194
aVIt was April, I remember,
p195
aVa very beautiful day.
p196
aVApril in Kabul is beautiful,
p197
aVfull of roses, full of flowers.
p198
aVWe could not possibly stay indoors,
p199
aVwith all these sandbags at the windows.
p200
aVVery sad, dark.
p201
aVSo we chose a small spot in the garden.
p202
aVAnd Mahmoud put on his prostheses,
p203
aVthe other patients did the same,
p204
aVand they started practicing
p205
aVfor the last time before being discharged.
p206
aa(lp207
VSuddenly, they started fighting.
p208
aVTwo groups of Mujahideen started fighting.
p209
aVWe could hear in the air
p210
aVthe bullets passing.
p211
aVSo we dashed, all of us,
p212
aVtowards the shelter.
p213
aVMahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.
p214
aVEverybody was grabbing something.
p215
aVAnd we ran.
p216
aVYou know, 50 meters can be a long distance
p217
aVif you are totally exposed,
p218
aVbut we managed to reach the shelter.
p219
aVInside, all of us panting,
p220
aVI sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,
p221
aV"Father, you can run faster than me."
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVAnd Mahmoud, "Of course I can.
p224
aVI can run, and now you can go to school.
p225
aVNo need of staying with me all the day
p226
aVpushing my wheelchair."
p227
aVLater on, we took them home.
p228
aVAnd I will never forget
p229
aVMahmoud and his son walking together
p230
aVpushing the empty wheelchair.
p231
aVAnd then I understood,
p232
aVphysical rehabilitation is a priority.
p233
aVDignity cannot wait for better times.
p234
aa(lp235
VFrom that day on, we never closed a single day.
p236
aVWell sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,
p237
aVbut we never, we never closed it again.
p238
aVI met Mahmoud one year later.
p239
aVHe was in good shape \u2014
p240
aVa bit thinner.
p241
aVHe needed to change his prostheses \u2014
p242
aVa new pair of prostheses.
p243
aVI asked about his son.
p244
aVHe told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well."
p245
aVBut I understood he wanted to tell me something.
p246
aVSo I asked him, "What is that?"
p247
aVHe was sweating.
p248
aVHe was clearly embarrassed.
p249
aVAnd he was standing in front of me,
p250
aVhis head down.
p251
aVHe said, "You have taught me to walk.
p252
aVThank you very much.
p253
aVNow help me not to be a beggar anymore."
p254
aVThat was the job.
p255
aV"My children are growing.
p256
aVI feel ashamed.
p257
aVI don't want them to be teased at school
p258
aVby the other students."
p259
aVI said, "Okay."
p260
aVI thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?
p261
aVJust to give him some money.
p262
aVIt was the easiest way.
p263
aVHe read my mind,
p264
aVand he said, "I ask for a job."
p265
aVAnd then he added something
p266
aVI will never forget for the rest of my life.
p267
aVHe said, "I am a scrap of a man,
p268
aVbut if you help me,
p269
aVI'm ready to do anything,
p270
aVeven if I have to crawl on the ground."
p271
aVAnd then he sat down.
p272
aVI sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.
p273
aa(lp274
VLegless, with only one arm,
p275
aVilliterate,
p276
aVunskilled \u2014
p277
aVwhat job for him?
p278
aVNajmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy
p279
aVin the carpentry shop."
p280
aV"What?" I said, "Stop."
p281
aV"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.
p282
aVWe need to employ someone
p283
aVto glue and to screw the sole of the feet.
p284
aVWe need to increase the production."
p285
aV"Excuse me?"
p286
aVI could not believe.
p287
aVAnd then he said,
p288
aV"No, we can modify the workbench
p289
aVmaybe to put a special stool,
p290
aVa special anvil, special vice,
p291
aVand maybe an electric screwdriver."
p292
aVI said, "Listen, it's insane.
p293
aVAnd it's even cruel to think of anything like this.
p294
aVThat's a production line and a very fast one.
p295
aVIt's cruel
p296
aVto offer him a job
p297
aVknowing that he's going to fail."
p298
aVBut with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.
p299
aVSo the only things I could manage to obtain
p300
aVwas a kind of a compromise.
p301
aVOnly one week \u2014
p302
aVone week try and not a single day more.
p303
aVOne week later,
p304
aVMahmoud was the fastest in the production line.
p305
aVI told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.
p306
aVI can't believe it."
p307
aVThe production was up 20 percent.
p308
aV"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.
p309
aVAnd then I asked for verification.
p310
aVIt was true.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.
p313
aVI understood
p314
aVthat I was wrong again.
p315
aVMahmoud had looked taller.
p316
aVI remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.
p317
aVHe was a new man,
p318
aVtaller again.
p319
aVOf course, I understood
p320
aVthat what made him stand tall \u2014
p321
aVyeah they were the legs, thank you very much \u2014
p322
aVbut as a first step,
p323
aVit was the dignity.
p324
aVHe has regained his full dignity
p325
aVthanks to that job.
p326
aVSo of course, I understood.
p327
aVAnd then we started a new policy \u2014
p328
aVa new policy completely different.
p329
aVWe decided to employ
p330
aVas many disabled as possible
p331
aVto train them in any possible job.
p332
aVIt became a policy of "positive discrimination,"
p333
aVwe call it now.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd you know what?
p336
aVIt's good for everybody.
p337
aVEverybody benefits from that \u2014
p338
aVthose employed, of course,
p339
aVbecause they get a job
p340
aVand dignity.
p341
aVBut also for the newcomers.
p342
aVThey are 7,000 every year \u2014
p343
aVpeople coming for the first time.
p344
aVAnd you should see the faces of these people
p345
aVwhen they realize that those assisting them are like them.
p346
aVSometimes you see them,
p347
aVthey look, "Oh."
p348
aVAnd you see the faces.
p349
aVAnd then the surprise turns into hope.
p350
aVAnd it's easy for me as well to train someone
p351
aVwho has already passed through the experience of disability.
p352
aVPoof, they learn much faster \u2014 the motivation,
p353
aVthe empathy they can establish with the patient
p354
aVis completely different, completely.
p355
aVScraps of men do not exist.
p356
aa(lp357
VPeople like Mahmoud
p358
aVare agents of change.
p359
aVAnd when you start changing, you cannot stop.
p360
aVSo employing people, yes,
p361
aVbut also we started programming projects
p362
aVof microfinance, education.
p363
aVAnd when you start, you cannot stop.
p364
aVSo you do vocational training,
p365
aVhome education for those who cannot go to school.
p366
aVPhysical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,
p367
aVbut also in the houses of the people.
p368
aVThere is always a better way to do things.
p369
aVThat's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.
p370
aVTerrible Najmuddin, is that one.
p371
aVI have learned a lot
p372
aVfrom people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.
p373
aVThey are my teachers.
p374
aa(lp375
VI have a wish, a big wish,
p376
aVthat this way of working, this way of thinking,
p377
aVis going to be implemented in other countries.
p378
aVThere are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.
p379
aVIt is possible and it is not difficult.
p380
aVAll we have to do
p381
aVis to listen to the people
p382
aVthat we are supposed assist,
p383
aVto make them part
p384
aVof the decision-making process
p385
aVand then, of course, to adapt.
p386
aVThis is my big wish.
p387
aa(lp388
VWell don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;
p389
aVnot at all. We are going on.
p390
aVRecently we have just started a program,
p391
aVa sport program \u2014
p392
aVbasketball for wheelchair users.
p393
aVWe transport the wheelchairs everywhere.
p394
aVWe have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.
p395
aVAt the beginning,
p396
aVwhen Anajulina told me,
p397
aV"We would like to start it,"
p398
aVI hesitated.
p399
aVI said, "No," you can imagine.
p400
aVI said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."
p401
aVAnd then I asked the usual question:
p402
aV"Is it a priority?
p403
aVIs it really necessary?"
p404
aVWell now you should see me.
p405
aVI never miss a single training session.
p406
aVThe night before a match I'm very nervous.
p407
aVAnd you should see me during the match.
p408
aVI shout like a true Italian.
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VWhat's next? What is going to be the next change?
p413
aVWell I don't know yet,
p414
aVbut I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,
p415
aVthey have it already in mind.
p416
aa(lp417
VThat was my story. Thank you very much.
