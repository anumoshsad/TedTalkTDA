VI've actually been waiting by the phone
p4
aVfor a call from TED for years.
p5
aVAnd in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
p6
aVIn 2003, I was ready to do a talk
p7
aVabout the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
p8
aVIn 2004, I started Participant Productions
p9
aVand we had a really good first year, and no call.
p10
aVAnd finally, I get a call last year,
p11
aVand then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVYou've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VWhen I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,
p17
aVI had some misgivings.
p18
aVBut I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAnd, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
p21
aVAnd I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
p22
aVhave a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
p23
aVHollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVHollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
p26
aVHollywood gathers around power tables,
p27
aVand the Valley gathers around power tables.
p28
aVSo it turned out there was a lot more in common
p29
aVthan I would have dreamed.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut I'm actually here today to tell a story.
p32
aVAnd part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
p33
aVhe said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
p34
aVand they want to know what drives you a bit.
p35
aVAnd what really drives me is a vision of the future
p36
aVthat I think we all share.
p37
aVIt's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
p38
aVAnd when we heard a lot of the presentations
p39
aVover the last couple of days,
p40
aVEd Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,
p41
aVI think we all realized how far we have to go
p42
aVto get to this new version of humanity
p43
aVthat I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
p44
aVAnd it's also something that resides in each of us,
p45
aVto close what I think
p46
aVare the two big calamities in the world today.
p47
aa(lp48
VOne is the gap in opportunity \u2014
p49
aVthis gap that President Clinton last night
p50
aVcalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable \u2014
p51
aVand, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
p52
aVand all these evils that we see around us.
p53
aVBut perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
p54
aVAnd someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
p55
aVthat an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
p56
aVAnd I think that's just a horrible thing.
p57
aVAnd so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
p58
aVbecause within each of us is the power to
p59
aVequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
p60
aVAnd if the men and women of TED
p61
aVcan't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd for me, a lot of this started when I was younger
p64
aVand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
p65
aVAnd there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
p66
aVexcept get beaten up by my sister or read books.
p67
aVAnd so I used to read authors like James Michener
p68
aVand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
p69
aVAnd their stories made the world seem a very small
p70
aVand interconnected place.
p71
aVAnd it struck me that if I could write stories
p72
aVthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,
p73
aVthat maybe I could get people interested in the issues
p74
aVthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
p75
aa(lp76
VI didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,
p77
aVso I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
p78
aVso I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
p79
aVI then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
p80
aVAnd my dad came home one day
p81
aVand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
p82
aVAnd what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
p83
aVbut that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
p84
aVAnd knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
p85
aVBut for a young man that made a real impression on me,
p86
aVthat one never knows how much time one really has.
p87
aVSo I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
p88
aVI started a couple of businesses
p89
aVthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
p90
aa(lp91
VOne of those businesses was a computer rental business
p92
aVcalled Micros on the Move,
p93
aVwhich is very well named,
p94
aVbecause people kept stealing the computers.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVSo I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
p97
aVso I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
p98
aVAnd while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
p99
aVnamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
p100
aVfor this. This is a photo from the old days.
p101
aVAnd just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
p102
aVwith this idea to help people
p103
aVbuy and sell things online with each other.
p104
aVAnd with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,
p105
aVI said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd needless to say, I was right.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VBut right after that, Pierre \u2014 in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs
p111
aVto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
p112
aVThe company went public two years later
p113
aVand is today one of the best known companies in the world.
p114
aVHundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
p115
aVBut for me, personally, it was a real change.
p116
aVI went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
p117
aVand living off their leftovers,
p118
aVto all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
p119
aVAnd I wanted to figure out how I could
p120
aVtake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd around that time, I met John Gardner,
p123
aVwho is a remarkable man.
p124
aVHe was the architect of the Great Society programs
p125
aVunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
p126
aVAnd I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
p127
aVor anyone could do, to make a difference
p128
aVin the long-term issues facing humanity.
p129
aVAnd John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
p130
aVBet on good people doing good things."
p131
aVAnd that really resonated with me.
p132
aa(lp133
VI started a foundation
p134
aVto bet on these good people doing good things.
p135
aVThese leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,
p136
aVwho are using business skills in a very leveraged way
p137
aVto solve social problems.
p138
aVPeople today we call social entrepreneurs.
p139
aVAnd to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
p140
aVwho started the Grameen Bank,
p141
aVhas lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
p142
aVwon the Nobel Peace Prize.
p143
aVBut there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
p144
aVFolks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
p145
aVbecause she felt girls' education was lagging.
p146
aVAnd she started it about 10 years ago,
p147
aVand today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
p148
aVAnd somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,
p149
aVwho started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
p150
aVand whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
p151
aValso known as black fever.
p152
aVAnd by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
p153
aVwhich is really a scourge in the developing world.
p154
aVAnd so this is one way to bet
p155
aVon good people doing good things.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change
p158
aVthat I find really is powerful.
p159
aVIt's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
p160
aVAnd invest: if you see good people doing good things,
p161
aVinvest in them. Invest in their organizations,
p162
aVor in business. Invest in these folks.
p163
aVConnecting them together through conferences \u2014
p164
aVlike a TED \u2014 brings so many powerful connections,
p165
aVor through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
p166
aVthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.
p167
aVAnd celebrate them: tell their stories,
p168
aVbecause not only are there good people doing good work,
p169
aVbut their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,
p172
aVthat really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
p173
aVand wanted to tell stories to get people involved
p174
aVin the issues that affect us all.
p175
aVAnd a light bulb went off,
p176
aVwhich was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
p177
aVAnd then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
p178
aVwhat about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
p179
aVAnd I thought about the films that inspired me,
p180
aVfilms like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
p181
aVAnd I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
p182
aVAnd there really wasn't a specific company
p183
aVthat was focused on the public interest.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles
p186
aVto talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
p187
aVand I was met with a lot of encouragement.
p188
aVOne of the lines of encouragement
p189
aVthat I heard over and over was,
p190
aV"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,
p191
aVwho think you're going to come to this town and make movies."
p192
aVAnd then of course, there was the other adage.
p193
aV"The surest way to become a millionaire
p194
aVis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VUndeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions
p198
aVwith the vision to be a global media company
p199
aVfocused on the public interest.
p200
aVAnd our mission is to produce entertainment
p201
aVthat creates and inspires social change.
p202
aVAnd we don't just want people to see our movies
p203
aVand say, that was fun, and forget about it.
p204
aVWe want them to actually get involved in the issues.
p205
aVIn 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
p206
aV"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"
p207
aVand "Good Night and Good Luck."
p208
aVAnd much to my surprise, they were noticed.
p209
aa(lp210
VWe ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
p211
aVAnd it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
p212
aVPerhaps more importantly,
p213
aVtens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
p214
aVand the activism programs
p215
aVthat we created to go around the movies.
p216
aVAnd we had an online component of that,
p217
aVour community sect called Participate.net.
p218
aVBut with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
p219
aVSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
p220
aVthere was actually something they could do to make a difference.
p221
aa(lp222
VOne of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually
p223
aVkind of a box office disaster.
p224
aVBut it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
p225
aVand it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,
p226
aVdomestic violence and so on.
p227
aVAnd we released the film at the same time that
p228
aVthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
p229
aVAnd with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,
p230
aVand with our social sector partners,
p231
aVlike the National Organization of Women,
p232
aVthe film was widely credited
p233
aVwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.
p234
aVAnd that to me, spoke volumes, because it's \u2014
p235
aVthe film started about a true-life story
p236
aVabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
p237
aVled to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
p238
aVand the Violence Against Women Act and others.
p239
aVAnd then the movie about this person doing these things,
p240
aVthen led to this greater renewal.
p241
aVAnd so again,
p242
aVit goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
p243
aa(lp244
VSpeaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al \u2014
p245
aVI first saw Al do his slide show presentation
p246
aVon global warming in May of 2005.
p247
aVAt that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
p248
aVI thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
p249
aVAnd after we saw his slide show,
p250
aVit became clear that it was much more urgent.
p251
aVAnd so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
p252
aVwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
p253
aVand Davis Guggenheim,
p254
aVwho was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
p255
aVAnd with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
p256
aVbecause we felt that we could get the message out there
p257
aVfar more quickly than having Al go around the world,
p258
aVspeaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,
p261
aVthat nobody knows nothing about anything.
p262
aVAnd I really thought this was going to be
p263
aVa straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
p264
aVAnd so it was a great shock to all of us
p265
aVwhen the film really captured the public interest,
p266
aVand today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
p267
aVand most of Scandinavia.
p268
aVWe've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
p269
aVand it's really changed the debate on global warming.
p270
aVIt was also a pretty good year for this guy.
p271
aVWe now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd for Participant, this is just the start.
p275
aVEverything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
p276
aVAnd we have 10 films in production right now,
p277
aVand dozens others in development.
p278
aVI'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
p279
aVOne is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
p280
aVAnd it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
p281
aVhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
p282
aVAnd we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"
p283
aVbased on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
p284
aVAnd we think once people see these films,
p285
aVthey'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
p286
aVand the Middle East in general.
p287
aa(lp288
VWe premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
p289
aVIt's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
p290
aVAbby Hoffman and crew,
p291
aVand, again, a story about a small group of individuals
p292
aVwho did make change in the world.
p293
aVAnd a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
p294
aVand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
p295
aVAnd in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
p296
aVwhich, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial \u2014
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aV\u2014 which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
p299
aa(lp300
VIn closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity
p301
aVto make change in their own way.
p302
aVAnd all the people in this room
p303
aVhave done so through their business lives,
p304
aVor their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
p305
aVAnd one thing that I've learned
p306
aVis that there's never one right way to make change.
p307
aVOne can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
p308
aVor a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
p309
aVbut every one of us is all of those things and more.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I believe if we do these things,
p312
aVwe can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
p313
aVAnd I can imagine, if we do this,
p314
aVthe headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
p315
aV"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"
p316
aV"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" \u2014
p317
aV(Applause)
p318
aV\u2014 "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate
p319
aV10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."
p320
aV(Applause)
p321
aVAnd I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVAnd finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
p324
aVnow obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
p325
aVAnd I believe that, working together,
p326
aVwe can make all of these things happen.
p327
aVAnd I want to thank you all for having me here today.
p328
aVIt's been a real honor. Thank you.
p329
aV(Applause)
p330
aVOh, thank you.
