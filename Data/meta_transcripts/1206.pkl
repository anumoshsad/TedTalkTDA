VSo today, I want us to reflect
p4
aVon the demise of guys.
p5
aVGuys are flaming out academically;
p6
aVthey're wiping out socially with girls
p7
aVand sexually with women.
p8
aVOther than that, there's not much of a problem.
p9
aVSo what's the data?
p10
aVSo the data on dropping out is amazing.
p11
aVBoys are 30 percent more likely than girls
p12
aVto drop out of school.
p13
aVIn Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.
p14
aVGirls outperform boys now at every level,
p15
aVfrom elementary school to graduate school.
p16
aVThere's a 10 percent differential
p17
aVbetween getting BA's and all graduate programs,
p18
aVwith guys falling behind girls.
p19
aVTwo-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.
p20
aVAnd as you all know,
p21
aVboys are five times more likely than girls
p22
aVto be labeled as having attention deficit disorder \u2014
p23
aVand therefore we drug them with Ritalin.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhat's the evidence of wiping out?
p26
aVFirst, it's a new fear of intimacy.
p27
aVIntimacy means physical, emotional connection
p28
aVwith somebody else \u2014
p29
aVand especially with somebody of the opposite sex
p30
aVwho gives off ambiguous, contradictory,
p31
aVphosphorescent signals.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVAnd every year there's research done
p34
aVon self-reported shyness among college students.
p35
aVAnd we're seeing a steady increase among males.
p36
aVAnd this is two kinds.
p37
aVIt's a social awkwardness.
p38
aVThe old shyness was a fear of rejection.
p39
aVIt's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.
p40
aVThey don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,
p41
aVespecially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.
p42
aVThey don't know the language of face contact,
p43
aVthe non-verbal and verbal set of rules
p44
aVthat enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,
p45
aVlisten to somebody else.
p46
aa(lp47
VThere's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,
p48
aVwhich tries to account for why guys really prefer
p49
aVmale bonding over female mating.
p50
aVIt turns out, from earliest childhood,
p51
aVboys, and then men,
p52
aVprefer the company of guys \u2014
p53
aVphysical company.
p54
aVAnd there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,
p55
aVbecause guys have been with guys
p56
aVin teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,
p57
aVespecially in the military, and then in pubs.
p58
aVAnd this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday
p59
aVwhen guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,
p60
aVwatching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,
p61
aVrather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.
p62
aVThe problem is they now prefer
p63
aV[the] asynchronistic Internet world
p64
aVto the spontaneous interaction
p65
aVin social relationships.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhat are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.
p68
aVI think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,
p69
aVexcessive new access to pornography.
p70
aVThe problem is these are arousal addictions.
p71
aVDrug addiction, you simply want more.
p72
aVArousal addiction, you want different.
p73
aVDrugs, you want more of the same \u2014 different.
p74
aVSo you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd the problem is the industry is supplying it.
p77
aVJane McGonigal told us last year
p78
aVthat by the time a boy is 21,
p79
aVhe's played 10,000 hours of video games,
p80
aVmost of that in isolation.
p81
aVAs you remember, Cindy Gallop said
p82
aVmen don't know the difference
p83
aVbetween making love and doing porn.
p84
aVThe average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.
p85
aVAnd there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America \u2014
p88
aV15 billion annually.
p89
aVFor every 400 movies made in Hollywood,
p90
aVthere are 11,000 now made porn videos.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo the effect, very quickly,
p93
aVis it's a new kind of arousal.
p94
aVBoys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way
p95
aVfor change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.
p96
aVThat means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,
p97
aVwhich are analog, static, interactively passive.
p98
aVThey're also totally out of sync
p99
aVin romantic relationships,
p100
aVwhich build gradually and subtly.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo what's the solution? It's not my job.
p103
aVI'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut who should care? The only people who should care about this
p110
aVis parents of boys and girls,
p111
aVeducators, gamers, filmmakers
p112
aVand women who would like a real man
p113
aVwho they can talk to, who can dance,
p114
aVwho can make love slowly
p115
aVand contribute to the evolutionary pressures
p116
aVto keep our species above banana slugs.
p117
aVNo offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.
