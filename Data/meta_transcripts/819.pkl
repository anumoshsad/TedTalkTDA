VIt's not about technology,
p4
aVit's about people and stories.
p5
aVI could show you
p6
aVwhat recently was on television
p7
aVas a high quality video:
p8
aV60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.
p9
aVAnd it was the now director of the entire piece
p10
aVof the veteran's administration \u2014
p11
aVwho, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago
p12
aVin Vietnam \u2014
p13
aVwho was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices
p14
aVthat don't work.
p15
aVAnd it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,
p16
aVafter he pretty much made his position clear on this \u2014
p17
aVhe had his hook and he had his \u2014
p18
aVhe wore this arm for less than two hours
p19
aVand was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact
p20
aVthat, quote \u2014 his quote \u2014
p21
aVit's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,
p24
aVand I'm not going to show you that polished video.
p25
aVI'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,
p26
aVshow you an early, crude video
p27
aVbecause I think it's
p28
aVa better way to tell a story.
p29
aa(lp30
VA few years ago I was visited by
p31
aVthe guy that runs DARPA,
p32
aVthe people that fund all the advanced technologies
p33
aVthat businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.
p34
aVThey have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
p35
aVI get this sort of unrequested \u2014 by me anyway \u2014 visit,
p36
aVand sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon
p37
aVfrom the military
p38
aVand the guy that runs DARPA.
p39
aa(lp40
VThey proceed to tell me a story which comes down
p41
aVto basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies
p42
aVnow and made them available
p43
aVin the most remote places that we put soldiers:
p44
aVhills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...
p45
aVThey were quite proud of the fact that
p46
aVyou know, before the dust clears,
p47
aVif some soldier has been hurt
p48
aVthey will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,
p49
aVthey will be getting world-class triage emergency care
p50
aVfaster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt
p51
aVin a car accident in a major city in the United States.
p52
aVThat's the good news.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe bad news is if they've collected this person
p55
aVand he or she is missing an arm or leg,
p56
aVpart of the face, it's probably not coming back.
p57
aVSo, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.
p58
aVAnd then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,
p59
aVhe said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,
p60
aVthey were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,
p61
aVwe gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.
p62
aVNow we've got F18s and F22s,
p63
aVand if somebody loses an arm,
p64
aVwe give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd they basically said, "This is unacceptable,"
p67
aVand then the punchline: "So, Dean,
p68
aVwe're here because you make medical stuff.
p69
aVYou're going to give us an arm."
p70
aVAnd I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,
p71
aVpaperwork and DODs.
p72
aVNo, the guy says,
p73
aV"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,
p74
aVand wearing the arm you're going to give us,
p75
aVhe or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape
p76
aVoff this table.
p77
aVIf it's the grape, they won't break it."
p78
aVGreat he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
p79
aV"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."
p80
aVSo he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,
p81
aVflex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.
p82
aVEither way they were going to eat it.
p83
aa(lp84
V"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame \u2014
p85
aVnamely 32 inches from the long finger \u2014
p86
aVand weigh less than nine pounds."
p87
aV50th percentile female frame.
p88
aV"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power."
p89
aVSo, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,
p90
aVam a bashful guy.
p91
aVI told them they're nuts.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVThey've been watching too much "Terminator."
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVThen, the surgeon says to me,
p96
aV"Dean, you need to know
p97
aVmore than two dozen of these kids have come back
p98
aVbilateral."
p99
aVNow, I cannot imagine \u2014
p100
aVI'm sorry, you may have a better
p101
aVimagination than I do \u2014
p102
aVI can't imagine losing my arm,
p103
aVand typically at 22 years old.
p104
aVBut compared to that, losing two?
p105
aVSeems like that would be an inconvenience.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.
p108
aVI literally could not sleep
p109
aVthinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over
p110
aVwith no shoulders."
p111
aVSo, I decided we've got to do this.
p112
aVAnd trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.
p113
aVMost of my day job keeps me busy
p114
aVfunding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....
p115
aVAnd I've got a lot of day jobs.
p116
aVBut I figured I gotta do this.
p117
aVDid a little investigation,
p118
aVwent down to Washington, told them
p119
aVI still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.
p120
aVAnd I told them I'd build them an arm.
p121
aVI told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,
p122
aVand probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
p123
aVLook what it takes to make things like iPods.
p124
aV"Great," he said, "You got two years."
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVI said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm
p127
aVthat's under nine pounds
p128
aVthat has all that capability in one year.
p129
aVIt will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."
p130
aVWe sort of agreed to disagree.
p131
aa(lp132
VI went back and I started putting a team together,
p133
aVthe best guys I could find with a passion to do this.
p134
aVAt the end of exactly one year
p135
aVwe had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,
p136
aVall the sensors, all the microprocessors,
p137
aVall the stuff inside.
p138
aVI could show you it with a cosmesis on it
p139
aVthat's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see
p140
aVall this cool stuff.
p141
aVI then thought it would be years
p142
aVbefore we'd be able to make it really, really useful.
p143
aVIt turned out, as I think you could see
p144
aVin Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,
p145
aVpeople with a desire to do something
p146
aVare quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnyway, with less than 10 hours of use,
p149
aVtwo guys \u2014 one that's bilateral.
p150
aVHe's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,
p151
aVand he's high trans-humeral on the other.
p152
aVAnd that's Chuck and Randy together,
p153
aVafter 10 hours \u2014 were playing in our office.
p154
aVAnd we took some pretty cruddy home movies.
p155
aVAt the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute
p156
aVand a couple of seconds long,
p157
aVChuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,
p158
aVI can't do it.
p159
aVHe picks up a spoon, picks it up,
p160
aVscoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,
p161
aVholds the spoon level
p162
aVas he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,
p163
aVto his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVI cannot do that.
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVHis wife was standing behind me.
p168
aVShe's standing behind me at the time
p169
aVand she says, "Dean,
p170
aVChuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.
p171
aVSo, you've got a choice:
p172
aVWe keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."
p173
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, can we see that?
p176
aVThis is Chuck showing simultaneous control
p177
aVof all the joints.
p178
aVHe's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him
p179
aVis our engineer/surgeon,
p180
aVwhich is a convenient guy to have around.
p181
aVThere's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber
p182
aVlittle puck between them.
p183
aVAnd just as in the spirit of FIRST,
p184
aVgracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,
p185
aVso they decide to share a drink.
p186
aVThis is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.
p187
aVImagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,
p188
aVdoing either of those.
p189
aVNow Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,
p190
aVat least for my limited physical skill.
p191
aVAnd now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.
p192
aVHe's going to pick up a grape \u2014 he didn't drop it,
p193
aVhe didn't break it \u2014
p194
aVand he's going to eat it.
p195
aVSo, that's where we were
p196
aVat the end of about 15 months.
p197
aV(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VBut, as I've learned from Richard,
p200
aVthe technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,
p201
aVis not the story.
p202
aVI hadn't dealt with this kind of problem
p203
aVor frankly, this whole segment
p204
aVof the medical world.
p205
aVI'll give you some astounding things that have happened
p206
aVas we started this.
p207
aVAfter we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,
p208
aVand we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make \u2014
p209
aVyou can always get three out of four of anything you want;
p210
aVthe weight, the size, the cost, the functionality \u2014
p211
aVI put a bunch of guys in my plane
p212
aVand I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,
p213
aVbecause frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.
p214
aVIt doesn't matter whether the
p215
aVDepartment of Defense likes this arm."
p216
aVWhen I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,
p217
aVbut I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.
p218
aVThere is only one opinion that matters,
p219
aVthe kids that are either going to use it or not."
p220
aa(lp221
VI told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,
p222
aVand you're going to see people, lots of them,
p223
aVmissing major body parts.
p224
aVThey're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.
p225
aVWe're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.
p226
aVBut we've got to extract from them
p227
aVenough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."
p228
aVWe walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.
p229
aVWe did see a bunch of people,
p230
aVa lot of them missing a lot of body parts,
p231
aVand parts they had left were burned;
p232
aVhalf a face gone, an ear burned off.
p233
aa(lp234
VThey were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.
p235
aVAnd we started asking them all questions.
p236
aV"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.
p237
aVI could give you fine motor control,
p238
aVor I could let you curl 40 pounds;
p239
aVI probably can't do both.
p240
aVI can give you fast control
p241
aVwith low reduction ratios in these gears,
p242
aVor I can give you power;
p243
aVI can't give you both.
p244
aVAnd we were trying to get them to all help us
p245
aVknow what to give them.
p246
aVNot only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking
p247
aVthey're there to help us.
p248
aV"Well, would it help if I ..."
p249
aV"Guys, and woman,
p250
aVyou've given enough.
p251
aVWe're here to help you. We need data. We need to know
p252
aVwhat you need."
p253
aa(lp254
VAfter a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table
p255
aVwho wasn't saying much.
p256
aVYou could see he was missing an arm.
p257
aVHe was leaning on his other arm.
p258
aVI called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.
p259
aVIf we needed this or this, what would you want?"
p260
aVAnd he said, "You know,
p261
aVI'm the lucky guy at this table.
p262
aVI lost my right arm,
p263
aVbut I'm a lefty."
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVSo, he wouldn't say much.
p266
aVHe had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.
p267
aVAnd he made a few comments.
p268
aVAnd then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.
p269
aVAnd that guy pushed himself back from the table ...
p270
aVhe has no legs.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, we left.
p273
aVAnd I was thinking,
p274
aV"We didn't give them support and encouragement;
p275
aVthey gave it to us.
p276
aVThey're not finished giving yet."
p277
aVIt was astounding.
p278
aVSo, we went back.
p279
aVAnd I started working harder, faster.
p280
aVThen we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.
p281
aVAnd we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.
p282
aVAnd it was astounding
p283
aVhow positive they are.
p284
aVSo, we went back,
p285
aVand we've been working harder yet.
p286
aVWe're in clinical trials,
p287
aVwe've got five of them on people.
p288
aVWe're screaming along.
p289
aVAnd I get a call and we go back
p290
aVto Washington.
p291
aa(lp292
VWe go back to Walter Reed,
p293
aVand a kid, literally,
p294
aV20 some-odd days before that
p295
aVwas blown up.
p296
aVAnd they shipped him to Germany
p297
aVand 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany
p298
aVto Walter Reed.
p299
aVAnd he was there,
p300
aVand they said we needed to come.
p301
aVAnd I went down
p302
aVand they rolled him into a room.
p303
aVHe's got no legs.
p304
aVHe's got no arms.
p305
aVHe's got a small residual limb on one side.
p306
aVHalf of his face is gone,
p307
aVbut they said his vision is coming back.
p308
aVHe had one good eye.
p309
aVHis name is Brandon Marrocco.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd he said,
p312
aV"I need your arms,
p313
aVbut I need two of them."
p314
aV"You'll get them."
p315
aVThis kid was from Staten Island.
p316
aVAnd he said, "I had a truck,
p317
aVbefore I went over there,
p318
aVand it had a stick.
p319
aVYou think I'll be able to drive it?"
p320
aV"Sure."
p321
aVAnd I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVAnyway, he was just like all the rest of them.
p324
aVHe doesn't really want a lot.
p325
aVHe wants to help. He told me that
p326
aVhe wanted to go back
p327
aVto help his buddies.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo, I was on my way out here.
p330
aVI was asked to stop at Texas.
p331
aVThere were 3,500 people,
p332
aVthe Veteran's Administration,
p333
aVU.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event
p334
aVto help the families
p335
aVof all the kids \u2014
p336
aVsome that have died, some that are
p337
aVlike Brandon \u2014
p338
aVand they wanted me to speak.
p339
aVI said, "What am I going to say?
p340
aVThis is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,
p341
aVI can give you ... This stuff is
p342
aVstill not as good at the original equipment."
p343
aV"You need to come."
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, I went.
p346
aVAnd, as I think you get the point,
p347
aVthere were a lot people there recovering.
p348
aVSome further along than others.
p349
aVBut universally, these people that had been through this
p350
aVhad astounding attitudes,
p351
aVand just the fact that people care
p352
aVmakes a huge difference to them.
p353
aa(lp354
VI'll shut up, except one message
p355
aVor concern I have.
p356
aVI don't think anybody does it intentionally,
p357
aVbut there were people there literally talking about,
p358
aV"Well, how much will they get?"
p359
aVYou know, this country is involved as we've all heard,
p360
aVin this great healthcare debate.
p361
aV"Who is entitled to what?
p362
aVWho is entitled to how much?
p363
aVWho is going to pay for it?"
p364
aVThose are tough questions.
p365
aVI don't have an answer to that. Not everybody
p366
aVcan be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.
p367
aVIt's not possible. It would be nice
p368
aVbut let's be realistic.
p369
aa(lp370
VThey were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.
p371
aVI don't know the answers.
p372
aVThere are other questions that are tough.
p373
aV"Should we be there?
p374
aVHow do we get out?
p375
aVWhat do we need to do?" There's very polarized
p376
aVanswers to that question too,
p377
aVand I don't have any answers to that.
p378
aVThose are political questions, economic questions,
p379
aVstrategic questions.
p380
aVI don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple
p381
aVconcern or maybe statement, then.
p382
aVIt is an easy answer.
p383
aa(lp384
VI know what these kids deserve
p385
aVon the healthcare side.
p386
aVI was talking to one of them,
p387
aVand he was really liking this arm \u2014
p388
aVit's way, way, way better than a plastic
p389
aVstick with a hook on it \u2014
p390
aVbut there's nobody in this room that would rather have that
p391
aVthan the one you got.
p392
aVBut I was saying to him, "You know,
p393
aVthe first airplane
p394
aVwent 100 feet in 1903.
p395
aVWilbur and Orville.
p396
aVBut you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.
p397
aVBut now we got Eagles out there,
p398
aVF15s, even that Bald Eagle.
p399
aVI've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.
p400
aVI think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."
p401
aVAnd I said to that kid,
p402
aV"I'll stop when your buddies
p403
aVare envious of your Luke arm
p404
aVbecause of what it can do, and how it does it.
p405
aVAnd we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working
p406
aVuntil we do that."
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd I think this country
p409
aVought to continue its great debate,
p410
aVwhining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim."
p411
aVAnd whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.
p412
aVBut while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about
p413
aVwho's paying for what and how much we get,
p414
aVthe people that are out there
p415
aVgiving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,
p416
aVI know what they deserve:
p417
aVeverything humanly possible.
p418
aVAnd we ought to give it to them.
