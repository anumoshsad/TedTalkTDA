(lp3
VSo, let me add to the complexity
p4
aVof the situation we find ourselves in.
p5
aVAt the same time that we're solving for climate change,
p6
aVwe're going to be building cities for three billion people.
p7
aVThat's a doubling of the urban environment.
p8
aVIf we don't get that right,
p9
aVI'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save mankind,
p10
aVbecause so much depends on how we shape our cities:
p11
aVnot just environmental impacts,
p12
aVbut our social well-being,
p13
aVour economic vitality,
p14
aVour sense of community and connectedness.
p15
aa(lp16
VFundamentally, the way we shape cities is a manifestation
p17
aVof the kind of humanity we bring to bear.
p18
aVAnd so getting it right is, I think,
p19
aVthe order of the day.
p20
aVAnd to a certain degree, getting it right can help us solve climate change,
p21
aVbecause in the end,
p22
aVit's our behavior that seems to be driving the problem.
p23
aVThe problem isn't free-floating,
p24
aVand it isn't just ExxonMobil and oil companies.
p25
aVIt's us; how we live.
p26
aVHow we live.
p27
aa(lp28
VThere's a villain in this story.
p29
aVIt's called sprawl, and I'll be upfront about that.
p30
aVBut it's not just the kind of sprawl you think of, or many people think of,
p31
aVas low-density development
p32
aVout at the periphery of the metropolitan area.
p33
aVActually, I think sprawl can happen anywhere, at any density.
p34
aVThe key attribute is that it isolates people.
p35
aVIt segregates people into economic enclaves
p36
aVand land-use enclaves.
p37
aVIt separates them from nature.
p38
aVIt doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,
p39
aVthe interaction,
p40
aVthat make cities great places
p41
aVand that make society thrive.
p42
aVSo the antidote to sprawl is really what we all need to be thinking about,
p43
aVespecially when we're taking on this massive construction project.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo let me take you through one exercise.
p46
aVWe developed the model for the state of California
p47
aVso they could get on with reducing carbon emissions.
p48
aVWe did a whole series of scenarios for how the state could grow,
p49
aVand this is just one overly simplified one.
p50
aVWe mixed different development prototypes
p51
aVand said they're going to carry us through the year 2050,
p52
aV10 million new crew in our state of California.
p53
aVAnd one was sprawl.
p54
aVIt's just more of the same: shopping malls, subdivisions,
p55
aVoffice parks.
p56
aVThe other one was dominated by, not everybody moving to the city,
p57
aVbut just compact development,
p58
aVwhat we used to think of as streetcar suburbs,
p59
aVwalkable neighborhoods,
p60
aVlow-rise, but integrated, mixed-used environments.
p61
aVAnd the results are astounding.
p62
aVThey're astounding not just for the scale of the difference
p63
aVof this one shift in our city-making habit
p64
aVbut also because each one represents a special interest group,
p65
aVa special interest group that used to advocate for their concerns
p66
aVone at a time.
p67
aVThey did not see the, what I call, "co-benefits" of urban form
p68
aVthat allows them to join with others.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, land consumption:
p71
aVenvironmentalists are really concerned about this,
p72
aVso are farmers;
p73
aVthere's a whole range of people,
p74
aVand, of course, neighborhood groups that want open space nearby.
p75
aVThe sprawl version of California
p76
aValmost doubles the urban physical footprint.
p77
aa(lp78
VGreenhouse gas: tremendous savings,
p79
aVbecause in California, our biggest carbon emission comes from cars,
p80
aVand cities that don't depend on cars as much
p81
aVobviously create huge savings.
p82
aa(lp83
VVehicle miles traveled: that's what I was just talking about.
p84
aVJust reducing the average 10,000 miles per household per year,
p85
aVfrom somewhere in the mid-26,000 per household,
p86
aVhas a huge impact not just on air quality and carbon
p87
aVbut also on the household pocketbook.
p88
aVIt's very expensive to drive that much,
p89
aVand as we've seen,
p90
aVthe middle class is struggling to hold on.
p91
aa(lp92
VHealth care: we were talking about how do you fix it once we broke it \u2014
p93
aVclean the air.
p94
aVWhy not just stop polluting?
p95
aVWhy not just use our feet and bikes more?
p96
aVAnd that's a function of the kinds of cities that we shape.
p97
aa(lp98
VHousehold costs:
p99
aV2008 was a mark in time,
p100
aVnot of just the financial industry running amok.
p101
aVIt was that we were trying to sell too many of the wrong kind of housing:
p102
aVlarge lot, single family, distant,
p103
aVtoo expensive for the average middle-class family to afford
p104
aVand, quite frankly, not a good fit to their lifestyle anymore.
p105
aVBut in order to move inventory,
p106
aVyou can discount the financing and get it sold.
p107
aVI think that's a lot of what happened.
p108
aVReducing cost by 10,000 dollars \u2014
p109
aVremember, in California the median is 50,000 \u2014
p110
aVthis is a big element.
p111
aVThat's just cars and utility costs.
p112
aVSo the affordable housing advocates, who often sit off in their silos
p113
aVseparate from the environmentalists, separate from the politicians,
p114
aVeverybody fighting with everyone,
p115
aVnow begin to see common cause,
p116
aVand I think the common cause is what really brings about the change.
p117
aa(lp118
VLos Angeles, as a result of these efforts,
p119
aVhas now decided to transform itself
p120
aVinto a more transit-oriented environment.
p121
aVAs a matter of fact, since '08,
p122
aVthey've voted in 400 billion dollars of bonds for transit
p123
aVand zero dollars for new highways.
p124
aVWhat a transformation:
p125
aVLA becomes a city of walkers and transit,
p126
aVnot a city of cars.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VHow does it happen?
p131
aVYou take the least desirable land, the strip,
p132
aVyou add where there's space, transit
p133
aVand then you infill mixed-use development,
p134
aVyou satisfy new housing demands
p135
aVand you make the existing neighborhoods
p136
aVall around it more complex,
p137
aVmore interesting, more walkable.
p138
aa(lp139
VHere's another kind of sprawl:
p140
aVChina, high-density sprawl, what you think of as an oxymoron,
p141
aVbut the same problems, everything isolated in superblocks,
p142
aVand of course this amazing smog that was just spoken to.
p143
aVTwelve percent of GDP in China now is spent
p144
aVon the health impacts of that.
p145
aVThe history, of course, of Chinese cities is robust.
p146
aVIt's like any other place.
p147
aVCommunity was all about small, local shops
p148
aVand local services and walking, interacting with your neighbors.
p149
aVIt may sound utopian, but it's not.
p150
aVIt's actually what people really want.
p151
aVThe new superblocks \u2014
p152
aVthese are blocks that would have 5,000 units in them,
p153
aVand they're gated as well, because nobody knows anybody else.
p154
aVAnd of course, there isn't even a sidewalk, no ground floor shops \u2014
p155
aVa very sterile environment.
p156
aVI found this one case here in one of the superblocks
p157
aVwhere people had illicitly set up shops in their garages
p158
aVso that they could have that kind of local service economy.
p159
aVThe desire of people to get it right is there.
p160
aVWe just have to get the planners on board and the politicians.
p161
aa(lp162
VAll right. Some technical planning stuff.
p163
aVChongqing is a city of 30 million people.
p164
aVIt's almost as big as California.
p165
aVThis is a small growth area.
p166
aVThey wanted us to test the alternative to sprawl
p167
aVin several cities across China.
p168
aVThis is for four-and-a-half million people.
p169
aVWhat the takeaway from this image is,
p170
aVevery one of those circles is a walking radius
p171
aVaround a transit station \u2014
p172
aVmassive investment in metro and BRT,
p173
aVand a distribution that allows everybody
p174
aVto work within walking distance of that.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe red area, this is a blow-up.
p177
aVAll of a sudden, our principles called for green space
p178
aVpreserving the important ecological features.
p179
aVAnd then those other streets in there are auto-free streets.
p180
aVSo instead of bulldozing, leveling the site
p181
aVand building right up to the river,
p182
aVthis green edge was something that really wasn't normative in China
p183
aVuntil these set of practices
p184
aVbegan experimentation there.
p185
aVThe urban fabric, small blocks,
p186
aVmaybe 500 families per block.
p187
aVThey know each other.
p188
aVThe street perimeter has shops
p189
aVso there's local destinations.
p190
aVAnd the streets themselves become smaller,
p191
aVbecause there are more of them.
p192
aVVery simple,
p193
aVstraightforward urban design.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, here you have something I dearly love.
p196
aVThink of the logic.
p197
aVIf only a third of the people have cars,
p198
aVwhy do we give 100 percent of our streets to cars?
p199
aVWhat if we gave 70 percent of the streets
p200
aVto car-free, to everybody else,
p201
aVso that the transit could move well for them,
p202
aVso that they could walk, so they could bike?
p203
aa(lp204
VWhy not have \u2014
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
Vgeographic equity
p209
aVin our circulation system?
p210
aVAnd quite frankly, cities would function better.
p211
aVNo matter what they do,
p212
aVno matter how many ring roads they build in Beijing,
p213
aVthey just can't overcome complete gridlock.
p214
aVSo this is an auto-free street, mixed use along the edge.
p215
aVIt has transit running down the middle.
p216
aVI'm happy to make that transit autonomous vehicles,
p217
aVbut maybe I'll have a chance to talk about that later.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo there are seven principles that have now been adopted
p220
aVby the highest levels in the Chinese government,
p221
aVand they're moving to implement them.
p222
aVAnd they're simple,
p223
aVand they are globally, I think, universal principles.
p224
aVOne is to preserve the natural environment, the history
p225
aVand the critical agriculture.
p226
aa(lp227
VSecond is mix.
p228
aVMixed use is popular, but when I say mixed,
p229
aVI mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups
p230
aVas well as mixed-land use.
p231
aa(lp232
VWalk.
p233
aVThere's no great city that you don't enjoy walking in.
p234
aVYou don't go there.
p235
aVThe places you go on vacation are places you can walk.
p236
aVWhy not make it everywhere?
p237
aa(lp238
VBike is the most efficient means of transportation we know.
p239
aVChina has now adopted policies that put six meters of bike lane
p240
aVon every street.
p241
aVThey're serious about getting back to their biking history.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VComplicated planner-ese here:
p246
aVconnect.
p247
aVIt's a street network that allows many routes
p248
aVinstead of singular routes
p249
aVand provides many kinds of streets instead of just one.
p250
aa(lp251
VRide.
p252
aVWe have to invest more in transit.
p253
aVThere's no silver bullet.
p254
aVAutonomous vehicles are not going to solve this for us.
p255
aVAs a matter of fact, they're going to generate more traffic, more VMT,
p256
aVthan the alternative.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd focus.
p259
aVWe have a hierarchy of the city based on transit
p260
aVrather than the old armature of freeways.
p261
aVIt's a big paradigm shift,
p262
aVbut those two things have to get reconnected
p263
aVin ways that really shape the structure of the city.
p264
aVSo I'm very hopeful.
p265
aVIn California, the United States, China \u2014 these changes are well accepted.
p266
aa(lp267
VI'm hopeful for two reasons.
p268
aVOne is, most people get it.
p269
aVThey understand intrinsically
p270
aVwhat a great city can and should be.
p271
aVThe second is that the kind of analysis we can bring to bear now
p272
aVallows people to connect the dots,
p273
aVallows people to shape political coalitions
p274
aVthat didn't exist in the past.
p275
aVThat allows them to bring into being the kinds of communities we all need.
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VChris Anderson: So, OK: autonomous driving, self-driving cars.
p282
aVA lot of people here are very excited about them.
p283
aVWhat are your concerns or issues about them?
p284
aa(lp285
VPeter Calthorpe: Well, I think there's almost too much hype here.
p286
aVFirst is, everybody says we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.
p287
aVWhat they don't say is you're going to get a lot more vehicle miles.
p288
aVYou're going to get a lot more cars moving on streets.
p289
aVThere will be more congestion.
p290
aa(lp291
VCA: Because they're so appealing \u2014
p292
aVyou can drive while reading or sleeping.
p293
aa(lp294
VPC: Well, a couple of reasons.
p295
aVOne is, if they're privately owned, people will travel greater distances.
p296
aVIt'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.
p297
aVIf you can work on your way to work,
p298
aVyou can live in more remote locations.
p299
aVIt'll revitalize sprawl
p300
aVin a way that I'm deeply frightened.
p301
aVTaxis:
p302
aVabout 50 percent of the surveys say that people won't share them.
p303
aVIf they don't share them,
p304
aVyou can end up with a 90 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled.
p305
aVIf you share them,
p306
aVyou're still at around a 30 percent increase in VMT.
p307
aa(lp308
VCA: Sharing them, meaning having multiple people riding at once
p309
aVin some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?
p310
aa(lp311
VPC: Yeah, so the Uber share without a steering wheel.
p312
aVThe reality is, the efficiency of vehicles \u2014 you can do it
p313
aVwith or without a steering wheel, it doesn't matter.
p314
aVThey claim they're the only ones that are going to be efficient electric,
p315
aVbut that's not true.
p316
aVBut the real bottom line is that walking, biking and transit
p317
aVare the way cities and communities thrive.
p318
aVAnd putting people in their private bubbles,
p319
aVwhether they have a steering wheel or not,
p320
aVis the wrong direction.
p321
aVAnd quite frankly,
p322
aVthe image of an AV on its way to McDonald's to pick up a pack
p323
aVwithout its owner,
p324
aVjust being sent off on these kind of random errands
p325
aVis really frightening to me.
p326
aa(lp327
VCA: Well, thank you for that, and I have to say, the images you showed
p328
aVof those mixed-use streets were really inspiring, really beautiful.
p329
aa(lp330
