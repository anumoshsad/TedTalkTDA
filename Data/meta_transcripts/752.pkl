VPlease close your eyes,
p4
aVand open your hands.
p5
aVNow imagine what you could place in your hands:
p6
aVan apple, maybe your wallet.
p7
aVNow open your eyes.
p8
aVWhat about a life?
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat you see here is a premature baby.
p11
aVHe looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive
p12
aVbecause he can't regulate his own body temperature.
p13
aVThis baby is so tiny he doesn't have
p14
aVenough fat on his body to stay warm.
p15
aVSadly, 20 million babies like this
p16
aVare born every year around the world.
p17
aVFour million of these babies die annually.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive
p20
aVgrow up with severe, long-term health problems.
p21
aVThe reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,
p22
aVits only job is to grow.
p23
aVIf it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,
p24
aVresulting in a range of health problems
p25
aVfrom diabetes, to heart disease,
p26
aVto low I.Q.
p27
aVImagine: Many of these problems could be prevented
p28
aVif these babies were just kept warm.
p29
aa(lp30
VThat is the primary function of an incubator.
p31
aVBut traditional incubators require electricity
p32
aVand cost up to 20 thousand dollars.
p33
aVSo, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.
p34
aVAs a result, parents resort to local solutions
p35
aVlike tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,
p36
aVor placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here \u2014
p37
aVmethods that are both ineffective and unsafe.
p38
aVI've seen this firsthand over and over again.
p39
aa(lp40
VOn one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,
p41
aVwho had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.
p42
aVShe took her baby to the nearest village clinic,
p43
aVand the doctor advised her to take Rani
p44
aVto a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.
p45
aVBut that hospital was over four hours away,
p46
aVand Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,
p47
aVso her baby died.
p48
aa(lp49
VInspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,
p50
aVmy team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,
p51
aVsomething that could work without electricity,
p52
aVthat was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,
p53
aVgiven that the majority of births still take place in the home.
p54
aVWe needed something that was portable,
p55
aVsomething that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies
p56
aVand something ultra-low-cost,
p57
aVcompared to the 20,000 dollars
p58
aVthat an incubator in the U.S. costs.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo, this is what we came up with.
p61
aVWhat you see here looks nothing like an incubator.
p62
aVIt looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.
p63
aVYou can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
p64
aVThere's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.
p65
aVBut the magic is in this pouch of wax.
p66
aVThis is a phase-change material.
p67
aVIt's a wax-like substance with a melting point
p68
aVof human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.
p69
aVYou can melt this simply using hot water
p70
aVand then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature
p71
aVfor four to six hours at a time,
p72
aVafter which you simply reheat the pouch.
p73
aVSo, you then place it into this little pocket back here,
p74
aVand it creates a warm micro-environment
p75
aVfor the baby.
p76
aa(lp77
VLooks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times
p78
aVby going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians
p79
aVto ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.
p80
aVWe plan to launch this product in India in 2010,
p81
aVand the target price point will be 25 dollars,
p82
aVless than 0.1 percent of the cost
p83
aVof a traditional incubator.
p84
aa(lp85
VOver the next five years we hope to save the lives
p86
aVof almost a million babies.
p87
aVBut the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.
p88
aVThis seems counterintuitive,
p89
aVbut turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,
p90
aVpopulation sizes also decrease,
p91
aVbecause parents don't need to anticipate
p92
aVthat their babies are going to die.
p93
aVWe hope that the Embrace infant warmer
p94
aVand other simple innovations like this
p95
aVrepresent a new trend for the future of technology:
p96
aVsimple, localized, affordable solutions
p97
aVthat have the potential to make huge social impact.
p98
aa(lp99
VIn designing this we followed a few basic principles.
p100
aVWe really tried to understand the end user,
p101
aVin this case, people like Sevitha.
p102
aVWe tried to understand the root of the problem
p103
aVrather than being biased by what already exists.
p104
aVAnd then we thought of the most simple solution we could
p105
aVto address this problem.
p106
aVIn doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.
p107
aVAnd we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
