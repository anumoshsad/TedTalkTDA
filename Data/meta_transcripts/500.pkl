VI thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject
p4
aVof youth and age.
p5
aVI was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.
p6
aa(lp7
VThe first one is dedicated to
p8
aVSpencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.
p9
aVMy poem is called "Dirt."
p10
aa(lp11
VMy grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;
p12
aa(lp13
Vhalf a long century gone
p14
aa(lp15
Vand still she comes at me
p16
aa(lp17
Vwith that thick cruel yellow bar.
p18
aa(lp19
VAll because of a word I said,
p20
aa(lp21
Vnot even said really, only repeated.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut "Open," she says, "open up!"
p24
aa(lp25
Vher hand clawing at my head.
p26
aa(lp27
VI know now her life was hard;
p28
aa(lp29
Vshe lost three children as babies,
p30
aa(lp31
Vthen her husband died too,
p32
aa(lp33
Vleaving young sons, and no money.
p34
aa(lp35
VShe'd stand me in the sink to pee
p36
aa(lp37
Vbecause there was never room in the toilet.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut oh, her soap!
p40
aa(lp41
VMight its bitter burning have been
p42
aVwhat made me a poet?
p43
aa(lp44
VThe street she lived on was unpaved,
p45
aa(lp46
Vher flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen
p47
aa(lp48
Vwhere she stalked and caught me.
p49
aa(lp50
VDare I admit that after she did it
p51
aa(lp52
VI never really loved her again?
p53
aa(lp54
VShe lived to a hundred,
p55
aa(lp56
Veven then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,
p57
aa(lp58
Vbut I never, until now
p59
aa(lp60
Vloved her again.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhen that was published in a magazine
p63
aVI got an irate letter from my uncle.
p64
aV"You have maligned a great woman."
p65
aVIt took some diplomacy.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is called "The Dress."
p68
aVIt's a longer poem.
p69
aa(lp70
VIn those days,
p71
aa(lp72
Vthose days which exist for me only
p73
aVas the most elusive memory now,
p74
aa(lp75
Vwhen often the first sound you'd hear in the morning
p76
aVwould be a storm of birdsong,
p77
aa(lp78
Vthen the soft clop of the hooves
p79
aVof the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,
p80
aa(lp81
Vand the last sound at night as likely as not
p82
aa(lp83
Vwould be your father pulling up in his car,
p84
aa(lp85
Vhaving worked late again, always late,
p86
aa(lp87
Vand going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,
p88
aa(lp89
Vto shake out the ashes and damp the draft
p90
aVbefore he came upstairs to fall into bed \u2014
p91
aa(lp92
Vin those long-ago days,
p93
aa(lp94
Vwomen, my mother, my friends' mothers,
p95
aVour neighbors, all the women I knew \u2014
p96
aa(lp97
Vwore, often much of the day,
p98
aVwhat were called housedresses,
p99
aa(lp100
Vcheap, printed, pulpy,
p101
aVseemingly purposefully shapeless
p102
aVlight cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown
p103
aa(lp104
Vand, when you had to go look for a child,
p105
aVhang wash on the line,
p106
aVor run down to the grocery store on the corner,
p107
aa(lp108
Vunder a coat,
p109
aVthe twisted hem of the nightgown
p110
aValways lank and yellowed,
p111
aVdangling beneath.
p112
aa(lp113
VMore than the curlers some of the women
p114
aVseemed constantly to have in their hair
p115
aVin preparation for some great event \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
Va ball, one would think \u2014
p118
aVthat never came to pass;
p119
aa(lp120
Vmore than the way most women's faces
p121
aVnot only were never made up during the day,
p122
aa(lp123
Vbut seemed scraped, bleached,
p124
aVand, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;
p125
aa(lp126
Vmore than all that it was those dresses
p127
aVthat made women so unknowable and forbidding,
p128
aa(lp129
Vadepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,
p130
aVand boys no conception.
p131
aa(lp132
VOnly later would I see the dresses also
p133
aVas a proclamation:
p134
aa(lp135
Vthat in your dim kitchen, your laundry,
p136
aVyour bleak concrete yard,
p137
aa(lp138
Vwhat you revealed of yourself
p139
aVwas a fabulation;
p140
aa(lp141
Vyour real sensual nature,
p142
aVveiled in those sexless vestments,
p143
aVwas utterly your dominion.
p144
aa(lp145
VIn those days, one hid much else as well:
p146
aa(lp147
Vgrown men didn't embrace one another,
p148
aVunless someone had died,
p149
aVand not always then; you shook hands
p150
aa(lp151
Vor, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back
p152
aVand exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;
p153
aa(lp154
Vonce out of childhood you'd never again know
p155
aVthe shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,
p156
aa(lp157
Vnot until mores at last had evolved,
p158
aVand you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,
p159
aa(lp160
Vthen even kiss (your fathers bristles
p161
aVwhite and stiff now).
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat release finally, the embrace:
p164
aVthough we were wary \u2014 it seemed so audacious \u2014
p165
aa(lp166
Vhow much unspoken joy there was
p167
aVin that affirmation of equality and communion,
p168
aa(lp169
Vno matter how much misunderstanding
p170
aVand pain had passed between you by then.
p171
aa(lp172
VWe knew so little in those days,
p173
aVas little as now, I suppose
p174
aVabout healing those hurts:
p175
aa(lp176
Veven the women, in their best dresses,
p177
aVwith beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,
p178
aa(lp179
Veven in lipstick and mascara,
p180
aVtheir hair aflow,
p181
aVcould only stand wringing their hands,
p182
aVbegging for peace,
p183
aa(lp184
Vwhile father and son, like thugs,
p185
aVlike thieves, like Romans,
p186
aVsimmered and hissed and hated,
p187
aa(lp188
Vinflicting sorrows that endured,
p189
aVthe worst anyway,
p190
aVthrough the kiss and embrace,
p191
aa(lp192
Vbleeding from brother to brother,
p193
aVinto the generations.
p194
aa(lp195
VIn those days there was still countryside
p196
aVclose to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;
p197
aa(lp198
Veven not far from our building
p199
aVwith its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway
p200
aa(lp201
Vyou could find tracts with hills and trees
p202
aVyou could pretend were mountains and forests.
p203
aa(lp204
VOr you could go out by yourself
p205
aVeven to a half-block-long empty lot,
p206
aa(lp207
Vinto the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,
p208
aa(lp209
Vcrouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;
p210
aa(lp211
Valready there was wanting to be simpler,
p212
aVwanting, when they called you,
p213
aa(lp214
Vnever to go back.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is another longish one,
p219
aVabout the old and the young.
p220
aVIt actually happened right at the time we met.
p221
aVPart of the poem takes place in
p222
aVspace we shared and time we shared.
p223
aa(lp224
VIt's called "The Neighbor."
p225
aa(lp226
VHer five horrid, deformed little dogs
p227
aVwho incessantly yap on the roof under my window.
p228
aa(lp229
VHer cats, God knows how many,
p230
aVwho must piss on her rugs \u2014
p231
aVher landing's a sickening reek.
p232
aa(lp233
VHer shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,
p234
aVthen the door slamming fearfully shut,
p235
aa(lp236
Vonly the barking and the music \u2014 jazz \u2014
p237
aVfiltering as it does, day and night into the hall.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
Vhow it brought back my college sweetheart,
p242
aa(lp243
Vmy first real love, who \u2014 till I left her \u2014
p244
aVplayed the same record.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,
p247
aa(lp248
Vsang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions
p249
aVshe was too young for,
p250
aa(lp251
Vas I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.
p252
aa(lp253
VIt startled, then bored, then repelled me.
p254
aa(lp255
VMy starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap
p256
aVin the Village, that my neighbor was her.
p257
aa(lp258
VMy thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,
p259
aVbecome friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.
p260
aa(lp261
VMy seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.
p262
aa(lp263
VGray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,
p264
aa(lp265
Vher turning away, hiding her ravaged face
p266
aVin her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."
p267
aa(lp268
VSometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.
p269
aa(lp270
VA man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,
p271
aa(lp272
Vclaws scrabbling, then her \u2014 her voice
p273
aVhoarse, harsh, hollow,
p274
aValmost only a tone,
p275
aa(lp276
Vincoherent, a note, a squawk,
p277
aVbone on metal, metal gone molten,
p278
aa(lp279
Vcalling them back,
p280
aV"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.
p281
aVMy sweet angels, come back."
p282
aa(lp283
VMedea she was, next time I saw her.
p284
aa(lp285
VSorceress, tranced, ecstatic,
p286
aVstock-still on the sidewalk
p287
aa(lp288
Vragged coat hanging agape,
p289
aVpassersby flowing around her,
p290
aa(lp291
Vher mouth torn suddenly open
p292
aVas though in a scream,
p293
aa(lp294
Vsilently though, as though only in her brain
p295
aVor breast had it erupted.
p296
aa(lp297
VA cry so pure, practiced, detached,
p298
aVit had no need of a voice,
p299
aVor could no longer bear one.
p300
aa(lp301
VThese invisible links that allure,
p302
aVthese transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe girl, my old love,
p305
aVthe last lost time I saw her
p306
aa(lp307
Vwhen she came to find me at a party,
p308
aa(lp309
Vher drunkenly stumbling, falling,
p310
aVsprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,
p311
aVswollen with tears, her shame,
p312
aVher dishonor.
p313
aa(lp314
VMy ignorant, arrogant coarseness,
p315
aVmy secret pride, my turning away.
p316
aa(lp317
VStill life on a rooftop,
p318
aVdead trees in barrels, a bench broken,
p319
aVdogs, excrement, sky.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhat pathways through pain,
p322
aVwhat junctures of vulnerability,
p323
aVwhat crossings and counterings?
p324
aa(lp325
VToo many lives in our lives already,
p326
aVtoo many chances for sorrow,
p327
aVtoo many unaccounted-for pasts.
p328
aa(lp329
V"Behold me," the god of frenzied,
p330
aVinexhaustible love says,
p331
aVrising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."
p332
aa(lp333
VHer making her way
p334
aVdown the littered vestibule stairs,
p335
aVone agonized step at a time.
p336
aa(lp337
VMy holding the door.
p338
aa(lp339
VHer crossing the fragmented tiles,
p340
aVfaltering at the step to the street,
p341
aa(lp342
Vdroning, not looking at me,
p343
aV"Can you help me?"
p344
aa(lp345
VTaking my arm, leaning lightly against me.
p346
aVHer wavering step into the world.
p347
aa(lp348
VHer whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VI think I'll lighten up a little.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVAnother, different kind of poem of youth and age.
p355
aa(lp356
VIt's called "Gas."
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VWouldn't it be nice, I think,
p361
aa(lp362
Vwhen the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room
p363
aVbends over the magazine table
p364
aa(lp365
Vand farts, just a little,
p366
aVand violently blushes.
p367
aa(lp368
VWouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas
p369
aVcame embodied in visible clouds,
p370
aa(lp371
Vso she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop
p372
aVhad only barely grazed my face
p373
aa(lp374
Vbefore it drifted away.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VBesides, for this to have happened now
p379
aVis a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,
p380
aVwhile we were on our walk,
p381
aa(lp382
Vmy dog was startled by a backfire
p383
aVand jumped straight up like a horse bucking.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd that brought back to me the stable
p386
aVI worked on weekends when I was 12,
p387
aa(lp388
Vand a splendid piebald stallion,
p389
aa(lp390
Vwho whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,
p391
aVthough more hugely of course,
p392
aVenormous, gleaming, resplendent.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd the woman, her face abashedly buried
p395
aVin her "Elle" now, reminded me \u2014
p396
aa(lp397
VI'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe
p398
aVconsisted of the fact that with every jump he took
p399
aa(lp400
Vthe horse would powerfully fart.
p401
aa(lp402
VPhwap! Phwap! Phwap!
p403
aa(lp404
VSomething never mentioned
p405
aVin the dozens of books about horses
p406
aVand their riders I devoured in those days.
p407
aa(lp408
VAll that savage grandeur,
p409
aVthe steely glinting hooves,
p410
aVthe eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,
p411
aa(lp412
Vbreath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,
p413
aa(lp414
VI didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
V(Applause)
p419
aa(lp420
VThis is called "Thirst."
p421
aVMany \u2014 most of my poems actually
p422
aVare urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.
p423
aa(lp424
V"Thirst."
p425
aa(lp426
VHere was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,
p427
aa(lp428
Vday and night, on a bench
p429
aVin the 103rd Street subway station,
p430
aVuntil finally one day she vanished.
p431
aa(lp432
VWe regarded each other, scrutinized one another.
p433
aa(lp434
VMe shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.
p435
aa(lp436
VShe boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,
p437
aVwrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.
p438
aa(lp439
VI was frightened of her. I felt like a child.
p440
aa(lp441
VI was afraid some repressed part of myself
p442
aVwould go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped
p443
aa(lp444
Vin the shocking seethe of her stench.
p445
aa(lp446
VNot excrement merely, not merely surface
p447
aVand orifice going unwashed,
p448
aVrediffusion of rum,
p449
aa(lp450
Vthere was will in it,
p451
aVand intention, power and purpose \u2014
p452
aVa social, ethical rage and rebellion \u2014
p453
aa(lp454
Vdespair too, though, grief, loss.
p455
aa(lp456
VSometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,
p457
aVbathe her, comfort her, dress her.
p458
aa(lp459
VShe wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.
p460
aVInstead, I'd step into my train.
p461
aa(lp462
VHow rich I would think, is the lexicon
p463
aVof our self-absolving.
p464
aa(lp465
VHow enduring, our bland fatal assurance
p466
aVthat reflection is righteousness being accomplished.
p467
aa(lp468
VThe dance of our glances,
p469
aVthe clash, pulling each other through
p470
aVour perceptual punctures,
p471
aa(lp472
Vthen holocaust, holocaust,
p473
aVhost on host of ill, injured presences,
p474
aVsquandered, consumed.
p475
aa(lp476
VHer vigil somewhere I know continues.
p477
aa(lp478
VHer occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.
p479
aa(lp480
VThe dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,
p481
aVeffacement, the perfume of our consternation.
p482
aa(lp483
V(Applause)
p484
aa(lp485
VThis is a newer poem, a brand new poem.
p486
aVThe title is "This Happened."
p487
aa(lp488
VA student, a young woman
p489
aVin a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,
p490
aa(lp491
Vperched on the ledge of an open window
p492
aVchatting with friends between classes;
p493
aa(lp494
Va teacher passes and chides her,
p495
aV"Be careful, you might fall,"
p496
aValmost banteringly chides her,
p497
aa(lp498
V"You might fall,"
p499
aa(lp500
Vand the young woman, 18, a girl really,
p501
aa(lp502
Vthough she wouldn't think that,
p503
aVas brilliant as she is, first in her class,
p504
aVand "Beautiful, too," she's often told,
p505
aa(lp506
Vsmiles back, and leans into the open window,
p507
aVwhich wouldn't even be open if it were winter \u2014
p508
aa(lp509
Vif it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") \u2014
p510
aa(lp511
Vleans into the window, farther, still smiling,
p512
aa(lp513
Vfarther and farther, though it takes less time
p514
aVthan this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.
p515
aa(lp516
VHerself fall.
p517
aa(lp518
VA casual impulse, a fancy,
p519
aVnever thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...
p520
aa(lp521
VNo, more than impulse or fancy,
p522
aVthe girl knows what she's doing,
p523
aa(lp524
Vthe girl means something,
p525
aVthe girl means to mean,
p526
aa(lp527
Vbecause it occurs to her in that instant,
p528
aVthat beautiful or not, bright yes or no,
p529
aVshe's not who she is,
p530
aa(lp531
Vshe's not the person she is,
p532
aa(lp533
Vand the reason, she suddenly knows,
p534
aVis that there's been so much premeditation
p535
aa(lp536
Vwhere she is, so much plotting and planning,
p537
aa(lp538
Vthere's hardly a person where she is,
p539
aVor if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,
p540
aa(lp541
Vit's a self inhabited, lived in by her,
p542
aa(lp543
Vand seemingly even as she thinks it
p544
aVshe knows what's been missing:
p545
aa(lp546
Vgrace,
p547
aa(lp548
Vnot premeditation but grace,
p549
aVa kind of being in the world spontaneously,
p550
aVwith grace.
p551
aa(lp552
VWeightfully upon me was the world.
p553
aa(lp554
VWeightfully this self which graced the world
p555
aVyet never wholly itself.
p556
aa(lp557
VWeightfully this self which weighed upon me,
p558
aVthe release from which is what I desire
p559
aVand what I achieve.
p560
aa(lp561
VAnd the girl remembers, in this infinite instant
p562
aValready now so many times divided,
p563
aa(lp564
Vthe sadness she felt once,
p565
aVhardly knowing she felt it,
p566
aa(lp567
Vto merely inhabit herself.
p568
aa(lp569
VYes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,
p570
aa(lp571
Veven the earth with its compulsion
p572
aVto take unto itself all that falls
p573
aVmust know that falling is absurd,
p574
aa(lp575
Vyet the girl falling isn't myself,
p576
aVor she is myself,
p577
aVbut a self I took of my own volition unto myself.
p578
aVForever. With grace.
p579
aa(lp580
VThis happened.

aVBut I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here
p587

VThis is called "Old Man," appropriately enough.

p594
aVon our neighborhood newsstand.
p595
aa(lp596
VBut forget her breasts.
p597
aa(lp598
VA lush, fresh-lipped blond,
p599
aVskin glowing gold, sprawls there,
p600
aVresplendent.
p601
aa(lp602
V60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,
p603
aVhardly better than harlots, can still stir me.
p604
aa(lp605
VMaybe a coming of age in the
p606
aVAmerican sensual darkness,
p607
aa(lp608
Vnever seeing an unsmudged nipple,
p609
aVan uncensored vagina,
p610
aa(lp611
Vhas left me forever infected
p612
aVwith an unquenchable lust of the eye.
p613
aa(lp614
VAlways that erotic murmur,
p615
aa(lp616
VI'm hardly myself
p617
aVif I'm not in a state of incipient desire.
p618
aa(lp619
VGod knows though,
p620
aVthere are worse twists your obsessions can take.
p621
aa(lp622
VLast year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi
p623
aVguiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah
p624
aa(lp625
Vforbade them to look in one room.
p626
aVBecause there were images in it he said were licentious.
p627
aa(lp628
VThe display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,
p629
aa(lp630
Vsome trying to cover their genitals,
p631
aVothers too frightened to bother,
p632
aa(lp633
Vlined up in snow
p634
aVwaiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.
p635
aa(lp636
VThe girls, to my horror,
p637
aVaverted their gaze.
p638
aa(lp639
VWhat carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.
p640
aa(lp641
VEven that though. Another confession:
p642
aa(lp643
VOnce in a book on pre-war Poland,
p644
aa(lp645
Va studio portrait, an absolute angel,
p646
aVan absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.
p647
aa(lp648
VI kept finding myself at her page.
p649
aa(lp650
VThat she died in the camps made her \u2014
p651
aVI didn't dare wonder why \u2014
p652
aa(lp653
Vmore present, more precious.
p654
aa(lp655
VDied in the camps, that too people \u2014
p656
aVor Jews anyway \u2014
p657
aVkept from their children back then.
p658
aa(lp659
VBut it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.
p660
aa(lp661
VSex and death, how close they can seem.
p662
aa(lp663
VSo constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,
p664
aVsometimes I think I confound them.
p665
aa(lp666
VMy wife's loveliness almost consumes me.
p667
aa(lp668
VMy passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.
p669
aa(lp670
VWhen we make love, her holding me
p671
aVeverywhere all around me,
p672
aVI'm there and not there.
p673
aa(lp674
VMy mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,
p675
aa(lp676
VI live my life over, as though I were drowning.
p677
aa(lp678
VThen I am drowning, in despair
p679
aVat having to leave her,
p680
aVthis, everything, all,
p681
aVunbearable, awful.
p682
aa(lp683
VStill, to be able to die
p684
aVwith no special contrition,
p685
aVnot having been slaughtered, or enslaved.
p686
aa(lp687
VAnd not having to know history's next
p688
aVmad rage or regression,
p689
aVit might be a relief.
p690
aa(lp691
VNo. Again, no.
p692
aVI don't mean that for a moment.
p693
aa(lp694
VWhat I mean is the world holds me so tightly \u2014
p695
aVthe good and the bad \u2014
p696
aa(lp697
Vmy own follies and weakness
p698
aVthat even this counterfeit Venus
p699
aa(lp700
Vwith her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped
p701
aVwith gel, so moves me
p702
aa(lp703
Vmy breath catches.
p704
aVVamp. Siren. Seductress.
p705
aa(lp706
VHow much more she reveals
p707
aVin her glare of ink than she knows.
p708
aa(lp709
VHow she incarnates
p710
aVour desperate human need for regard,
p711
aa(lp712
Vour passion to live in beauty,
p713
aVto be beauty, to be cherished by glances,
p714
aa(lp715
Vif by no more, of something like love,
p716
