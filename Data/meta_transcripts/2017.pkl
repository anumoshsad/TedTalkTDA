VI grew up in a very small country town
p4
aVin Victoria.
p5
aVI had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.
p6
aVI went to school, I hung out with my friends,
p7
aVI fought with my younger sisters.
p8
aVIt was all very normal.
p9
aVAnd when I was 15, a member of my local community
p10
aVapproached my parents
p11
aVand wanted to nominate me
p12
aVfor a community achievement award.
p13
aVAnd my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,
p14
aVbut there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
p15
aVShe hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd they were right, you know.
p18
aVI went to school, I got good marks,
p19
aVI had a very low-key after school job
p20
aVin my mum's hairdressing salon,
p21
aVand I spent a lot of time watching
p22
aV"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."
p23
aVYeah, I know. What a contradiction.
p24
aVBut they were right, you know.
p25
aVI wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary
p26
aVat all.
p27
aVI wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement
p28
aVif you took disability out of the equation.
p29
aVYears later, I was on my second teaching round
p30
aVin a Melbourne high school,
p31
aVand I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class
p32
aVwhen this boy put up his hand and said,
p33
aV"Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"
p34
aVAnd I said, "What speech?"
p35
aVYou know, I'd been talking them
p36
aVabout defamation law for a good 20 minutes.
p37
aVAnd he said, "You know, like,
p38
aVyour motivational speaking.
p39
aVYou know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,
p40
aVthey usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aV"It's usually in the big hall."
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd that's when it dawned on me:
p45
aVThis kid had only ever experienced disabled people
p46
aVas objects of inspiration.
p47
aVWe are not, to this kid \u2014
p48
aVand it's not his fault, I mean,
p49
aVthat's true for many of us.
p50
aVFor lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers
p51
aVor our doctors or our manicurists.
p52
aVWe're not real people. We are there to inspire.
p53
aVAnd in fact, I am sitting on this stage
p54
aVlooking like I do in this wheelchair,
p55
aVand you are probably kind of expecting me
p56
aVto inspire you. Right? (Laughter)
p57
aVYeah.
p58
aa(lp59
VWell, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid
p60
aVI'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
p61
aVI am not here to inspire you.
p62
aVI am here to tell you that we have been lied to
p63
aVabout disability.
p64
aVYeah, we've been sold the lie
p65
aVthat disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.
p66
aVIt's a bad thing, and to live with a disability
p67
aVmakes you exceptional.
p68
aVIt's not a bad thing, and it doesn't
p69
aVmake you exceptional.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd in the past few years, we've been able
p72
aVto propagate this lie even further
p73
aVvia social media.
p74
aVYou may have seen images like this one:
p75
aV"The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
p76
aVOr this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.
p77
aVOr this one: "Before you quit, try!"
p78
aVThese are just a couple of examples,
p79
aVbut there are a lot of these images out there.
p80
aVYou know, you might have seen the one,
p81
aVthe little girl with no hands
p82
aVdrawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
p83
aVYou might have seen a child running
p84
aVon carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
p85
aVAnd these images,
p86
aVthere are lots of them out there,
p87
aVthey are what we call inspiration porn.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVAnd I use the term porn deliberately,
p90
aVbecause they objectify one group of people
p91
aVfor the benefit of another group of people.
p92
aVSo in this case, we're objectifying disabled people
p93
aVfor the benefit of nondisabled people.
p94
aVThe purpose of these images
p95
aVis to inspire you, to motivate you,
p96
aVso that we can look at them
p97
aVand think, "Well, however bad my life is,
p98
aVit could be worse.
p99
aVI could be that person."
p100
aa(lp101
VBut what if you are that person?
p102
aVI've lost count of the number of times that I've
p103
aVbeen approached by strangers
p104
aVwanting to tell me that they think I'm brave
p105
aVor inspirational,
p106
aVand this was long before my work
p107
aVhad any kind of public profile.
p108
aVThey were just kind of congratulating me
p109
aVfor managing to get up in the morning
p110
aVand remember my own name. (Laughter)
p111
aVAnd it is objectifying.
p112
aVThese images, those images
p113
aVobjectify disabled people
p114
aVfor the benefit of nondisabled people.
p115
aVThey are there so that you can look at them
p116
aVand think that things aren't so bad for you,
p117
aVto put your worries into perspective.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd life as a disabled person
p120
aVis actually somewhat difficult.
p121
aVWe do overcome some things.
p122
aVBut the things that we're overcoming
p123
aVare not the things that you think they are.
p124
aVThey are not things to do with our bodies.
p125
aVI use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,
p126
aVbecause I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,
p127
aVwhich tells us that we are more disabled
p128
aVby the society that we live in
p129
aVthan by our bodies and our diagnoses.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo I have lived in this body a long time.
p132
aVI'm quite fond of it.
p133
aVIt does the things that I need it to do,
p134
aVand I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity
p135
aVjust as you have,
p136
aVand that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
p137
aVThey're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
p138
aVThey are just using their bodies
p139
aVto the best of their capacity.
p140
aVSo is it really fair to objectify them
p141
aVin the way that we do,
p142
aVto share those images?
p143
aVPeople, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"
p144
aVthey mean it as a compliment.
p145
aVAnd I know why it happens.
p146
aVIt's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold
p147
aVthis lie that disability makes you exceptional.
p148
aVAnd it honestly doesn't.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I know what you're thinking.
p151
aVYou know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,
p152
aVand you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,
p153
aVaren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"
p154
aVAnd the thing is, I am.
p155
aVI learn from other disabled people all the time.
p156
aVI'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.
p157
aVI am learning that it's a genius idea
p158
aVto use a pair of barbecue tongs
p159
aVto pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)
p160
aVI'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge
p161
aVyour mobile phone battery from your chair battery.
p162
aVGenius.
p163
aVWe are learning from each others' strength and endurance,
p164
aVnot against our bodies and our diagnoses,
p165
aVbut against a world that exceptionalizes
p166
aVand objectifies us.
p167
aa(lp168
VI really think that this lie that we've been sold
p169
aVabout disability is the greatest injustice.
p170
aVIt makes life hard for us.
p171
aVAnd that quote, "The only disability in life
p172
aVis a bad attitude,"
p173
aVthe reason that that's bullshit
p174
aVis because it's just not true,
p175
aVbecause of the social model of disability.
p176
aVNo amount of smiling at a flight of stairs
p177
aVhas ever made it turn into a ramp.
p178
aVNever. (Laughter) (Applause)
p179
aVSmiling at a television screen
p180
aVisn't going to make closed captions appear
p181
aVfor people who are deaf.
p182
aVNo amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop
p183
aVand radiating a positive attitude
p184
aVis going to turn all those books into braille.
p185
aVIt's just not going to happen.
p186
aa(lp187
VI really want to live in a world
p188
aVwhere disability is not the exception, but the norm.
p189
aVI want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl
p190
aVsitting in her bedroom
p191
aVwatching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
p192
aVisn't referred to as achieving anything
p193
aVbecause she's doing it sitting down.
p194
aVI want to live in a world
p195
aVwhere we don't have such low expectations
p196
aVof disabled people
p197
aVthat we are congratulated for getting out of bed
p198
aVand remembering our own names in the morning.
p199
aVI want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement
p200
aVfor disabled people,
p201
aVand I want to live in a world
p202
aVwhere a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school
p203
aVis not one bit surprised
p204
aVthat his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
p205
aa(lp206
VDisability doesn't make you exceptional,
p207
aVbut questioning what you think you know about it does.
p208
aa(lp209
