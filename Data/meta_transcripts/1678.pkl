VWhat is going to be the future of learning?
p4
aa(lp5
VI do have a plan,
p6
aVbut in order for me to tell you what that plan is,
p7
aVI need to tell you a little story,
p8
aVwhich kind of sets the stage.
p9
aa(lp10
VI tried to look at
p11
aVwhere did the kind of learning we do in schools,
p12
aVwhere did it come from?
p13
aVAnd you can look far back into the past,
p14
aVbut if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,
p15
aVit's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
p16
aVIt came from about 300 years ago,
p17
aVand it came from the last
p18
aVand the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]
p19
aVImagine trying to run the show,
p20
aVtrying to run the entire planet,
p21
aVwithout computers, without telephones,
p22
aVwith data handwritten on pieces of paper,
p23
aVand traveling by ships.
p24
aVBut the Victorians actually did it.
p25
aVWhat they did was amazing.
p26
aVThey created a global computer
p27
aVmade up of people.
p28
aVIt's still with us today.
p29
aVIt's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
p30
aVIn order to have that machine running,
p31
aVyou need lots and lots of people.
p32
aVThey made another machine to produce those people:
p33
aVthe school.
p34
aVThe schools would produce the people
p35
aVwho would then become parts of the
p36
aVbureaucratic administrative machine.
p37
aVThey must be identical to each other.
p38
aVThey must know three things:
p39
aVThey must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;
p40
aVthey must be able to read;
p41
aVand they must be able to do multiplication,
p42
aVdivision, addition and subtraction in their head.
p43
aVThey must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand
p44
aVand ship them to Canada
p45
aVand he would be instantly functional.
p46
aVThe Victorians were great engineers.
p47
aVThey engineered a system that was so robust
p48
aVthat it's still with us today,
p49
aVcontinuously producing identical people
p50
aVfor a machine that no longer exists.
p51
aVThe empire is gone,
p52
aVso what are we doing with that design
p53
aVthat produces these identical people,
p54
aVand what are we going to do next
p55
aVif we ever are going to do anything else with it?
p56
aa(lp57
V["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]
p58
aa(lp59
VSo that's a pretty strong comment there.
p60
aVI said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.
p61
aVI'm not saying they're broken.
p62
aVIt's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
p63
aVIt's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
p64
aVIt's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
p65
aVWhat are the kind of jobs that we have today?
p66
aVWell, the clerks are the computers.
p67
aVThey're there in thousands in every office.
p68
aVAnd you have people who guide those computers
p69
aVto do their clerical jobs.
p70
aVThose people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.
p71
aVThey don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
p72
aVThey do need to be able to read.
p73
aVIn fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, that's today, but we don't even know
p76
aVwhat the jobs of the future are going to look like.
p77
aVWe know that people will work from wherever they want,
p78
aVwhenever they want, in whatever way they want.
p79
aVHow is present-day schooling going to prepare them
p80
aVfor that world?
p81
aa(lp82
VWell, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.
p83
aVI used to teach people how to write computer programs
p84
aVin New Delhi, 14 years ago.
p85
aVAnd right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.
p86
aVAnd I used to think, how on Earth are those kids
p87
aVever going to learn to write computer programs?
p88
aVOr should they not?
p89
aVAt the same time, we also had lots of parents,
p90
aVrich people, who had computers,
p91
aVand who used to tell me, "You know, my son,
p92
aVI think he's gifted,
p93
aVbecause he does wonderful things with computers.
p94
aVAnd my daughter \u2014 oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."
p95
aVAnd so on. So I suddenly figured that,
p96
aVhow come all the rich people are having
p97
aVthese extraordinarily gifted children?
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVWhat did the poor do wrong?
p100
aVI made a hole in the boundary wall
p101
aVof the slum next to my office,
p102
aVand stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen
p103
aVif I gave a computer to children who never would have one,
p104
aVdidn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe children came running in.
p107
aVIt was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VThey said, "Why have you put it there?"
p113
aa(lp114
VI said, "Just like that."
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd I went away.
p119
aVAbout eight hours later,
p120
aVwe found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.
p121
aVSo I said, "Well that's impossible, because \u2014
p122
aVHow is it possible? They don't know anything."
p123
aa(lp124
VMy colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.
p125
aVOne of your students must have been passing by,
p126
aVshowed them how to use the mouse."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo I said, "Yeah, that's possible."
p129
aa(lp130
VSo I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi
p131
aVinto a really remote village
p132
aVwhere the chances of a passing software development engineer
p133
aVwas very little. (Laughter)
p134
aVI repeated the experiment there.
p135
aVThere was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,
p136
aVI went away, came back after a couple of months,
p137
aVfound kids playing games on it.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhen they saw me, they said,
p140
aV"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd they said something very interesting to me.
p147
aVIn an irritated voice, they said,
p148
aV"You've given us a machine that works only in English,
p149
aVso we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)
p150
aVThat's the first time, as a teacher,
p151
aVthat I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.
p152
aa(lp153
VHere's a short glimpse from those years.
p154
aVThat's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.
p155
aVOn your right is an eight-year-old.
p156
aVTo his left is his student. She's six.
p157
aVAnd he's teaching her how to browse.
p158
aVThen onto other parts of the country,
p159
aVI repeated this over and over again,
p160
aVgetting exactly the same results that we were.
p161
aV["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]
p162
aVAn eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.
p163
aVAnd finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,
p164
aVand said, "There's a processor inside."
p165
aa(lp166
VSo I started publishing.
p167
aVI published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,
p168
aVand I said, in nine months, a group of children
p169
aVleft alone with a computer in any language
p170
aVwill reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.
p171
aVI'd seen it happen over and over and over again.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut I was curious to know, what else would they do
p174
aVif they could do this much?
p175
aVI started experimenting with other subjects,
p176
aVamong them, for example, pronunciation.
p177
aVThere's one community of children in southern India
p178
aVwhose English pronunciation is really bad,
p179
aVand they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.
p180
aVI gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,
p181
aVand I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVThey did that, and watch a little bit of this.
p184
aa(lp185
VComputer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.
p186
aa(lp187
VSugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face
p188
aVof this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.
p189
aVShe has now joined a call center in Hyderabad
p190
aVand may have tortured you about your credit card bills
p191
aVin a very clear English accent.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo then people said, well, how far will it go?
p194
aVWhere does it stop?
p195
aVI decided I would destroy my own argument
p196
aVby creating an absurd proposition.
p197
aVI made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.
p198
aVTamil is a south Indian language, and I said,
p199
aVcan Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village
p200
aVlearn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English
p201
aVfrom a streetside computer?
p202
aVAnd I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.
p203
aVI'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,
p204
aVI'll go back, they'll get another zero.
p205
aVI'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
p206
aVI found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.
p207
aVI put in Hole in the Wall computers there,
p208
aVdownloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,
p209
aVmost of which I didn't understand.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"
p212
aa(lp213
VSo I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."
p214
aa(lp215
VSo they said, "How can we understand such big English words
p216
aVand diagrams and chemistry?"
p217
aa(lp218
VSo by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,
p219
aVso I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aV"And anyway, I am going away."
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSo I left them for a couple of months.
p225
aVThey'd got a zero. I gave them a test.
p226
aVI came back after two months
p227
aVand the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I said, "Well, what did I expect?"
p230
aVSo I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you
p231
aVbefore you decided that you can't understand anything?"
p232
aa(lp233
VSo they said, "We haven't given up.
p234
aVWe look at it every single day."
p235
aa(lp236
VSo I said, "What? You don't understand these screens
p237
aVand you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"
p238
aa(lp239
VSo a little girl who you see just now,
p240
aVshe raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,
p241
aVshe said, "Well, apart from the fact that
p242
aVimproper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,
p243
aVwe haven't understood anything else."
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VSo I tested them.
p248
aVI got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent
p249
aVin two months in the tropical heat
p250
aVwith a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know
p251
aVdoing something that's a decade ahead of their time.
p252
aVAbsurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.
p253
aVThirty percent is a fail.
p254
aVHow do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.
p255
aVI couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,
p256
aVa 22-year-old girl who was an accountant
p257
aVand she played with them all the time.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"
p260
aa(lp261
VSo she says, "Absolutely not.
p262
aVI didn't have science in school. I have no idea
p263
aVwhat they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."
p264
aa(lp265
VI said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."
p266
aa(lp267
VSo she says, "What's that?"
p268
aa(lp269
VI said, "Stand behind them.
p270
aVWhenever they do anything, you just say,
p271
aV'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?
p272
aVWhat's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'
p273
aVYou know what grannies do."
p274
aa(lp275
VSo she did that for two more months.
p276
aVThe scores jumped to 50 percent.
p277
aVKallikuppam had caught up
p278
aVwith my control school in New Delhi,
p279
aVa rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.
p280
aVWhen I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.
p281
aa(lp282
VHere's Kallikuppam.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.
p285
aa(lp286
VI got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,
p287
aVbut what she was saying, as you could make out,
p288
aVwas about neurons, with her hands were like that,
p289
aVand she was saying neurons communicate.
p290
aVAt 12.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo what are jobs going to be like?
p293
aVWell, we know what they're like today.
p294
aVWhat's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,
p295
aVchildren pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
p296
aVand then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.
p297
aa(lp298
VWhat will it be tomorrow?
p299
aVCould it be that we don't need to go to school at all?
p300
aVCould it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,
p301
aVyou can find out in two minutes?
p302
aVCould it be \u2014 a devastating question,
p303
aVa question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte \u2014
p304
aVcould it be that we are heading towards or maybe in
p305
aVa future where knowing is obsolete?
p306
aVBut that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.
p307
aVKnowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.
p308
aVBut look at it this way.
p309
aVIt took nature 100 million years
p310
aVto make the ape stand up
p311
aVand become Homo sapiens.
p312
aVIt took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.
p313
aVWhat an achievement that is.
p314
aVBut we have to integrate that into our own future.
p315
aa(lp316
VEncouragement seems to be the key.
p317
aVIf you look at Kuppam,
p318
aVif you look at all of the experiments that I did,
p319
aVit was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.
p320
aa(lp321
VThere is evidence from neuroscience.
p322
aVThe reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,
p323
aVwhen it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,
p324
aVit shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,
p325
aVit shuts all of that down.
p326
aVPunishment and examinations are seen as threats.
p327
aVWe take our children, we make them shut their brains down,
p328
aVand then we say, "Perform."
p329
aVWhy did they create a system like that?
p330
aVBecause it was needed.
p331
aVThere was an age in the Age of Empires
p332
aVwhen you needed those people who can survive under threat.
p333
aVWhen you're standing in a trench all alone,
p334
aVif you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.
p335
aVIf you didn't, you failed.
p336
aVBut the Age of Empires is gone.
p337
aVWhat happens to creativity in our age?
p338
aVWe need to shift that balance back
p339
aVfrom threat to pleasure.
p340
aa(lp341
VI came back to England looking for British grandmothers.
p342
aVI put out notices in papers saying,
p343
aVif you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,
p344
aVcan you give me one hour of your time per week for free?
p345
aVI got 200 in the first two weeks.
p346
aVI know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)
p347
aVThey're called the Granny Cloud.
p348
aVThe Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.
p349
aVIf there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.
p350
aVShe goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.
p351
aVI've seen them do it from a village called Diggles
p352
aVin northwestern England,
p353
aVdeep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,
p354
aV6,000 miles away.
p355
aVShe does it with only one age-old gesture.
p356
aV"Shhh."
p357
aVOkay?
p358
aa(lp359
VWatch this.
p360
aa(lp361
VGrandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.
p362
aVYou can't catch me.
p363
aa(lp364
VChildren: You can't catch me.
p365
aa(lp366
VGrandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.
p367
aa(lp368
VGrandmother: Well done! Very good.
p369
aa(lp370
VSM: So what's happening here?
p371
aVI think what we need to look at is
p372
aVwe need to look at learning
p373
aVas the product of educational self-organization.
p374
aVIf you allow the educational process to self-organize,
p375
aVthen learning emerges.
p376
aVIt's not about making learning happen.
p377
aVIt's about letting it happen.
p378
aVThe teacher sets the process in motion
p379
aVand then she stands back in awe
p380
aVand watches as learning happens.
p381
aVI think that's what all this is pointing at.
p382
aa(lp383
VBut how will we know? How will we come to know?
p384
aVWell, I intend to build
p385
aVthese Self-Organized Learning Environments.
p386
aVThey are basically broadband, collaboration
p387
aVand encouragement put together.
p388
aVI've tried this in many, many schools.
p389
aa(lp390
VIt's been tried all over the world, and teachers
p391
aVsort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"
p394
aa(lp395
VI said, "You won't believe the children who told me
p396
aVand where they're from."
p397
aa(lp398
VHere's a SOLE in action.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Children talking)
p401
aa(lp402
VThis one is in England.
p403
aVHe maintains law and order,
p404
aVbecause remember, there's no teacher around.
p405
aa(lp406
VGirl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons \u2014 SM: Australia
p407
aVGirl: \u2014 giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.
p408
aVThe net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons
p409
aVin the ion minus the number of electrons.
p410
aa(lp411
VSM: A decade ahead of her time.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.
p414
aVYou already heard about that. You know what that means.
p415
aVThere was a time when Stone Age men and women
p416
aVused to sit and look up at the sky and say,
p417
aV"What are those twinkling lights?"
p418
aVThey built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.
p419
aVWe've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.
p420
aVBut that's not sexy enough.
p421
aVThe way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,
p422
aV"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,
p423
aVhow would you figure out if it was going to or not?"
p424
aVAnd if he says, "Well, what? how?"
p425
aVyou say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"
p426
aVand leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
p427
aa(lp428
VSo here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
p429
aVI've tried incredible, incredible questions \u2014
p430
aV"When did the world begin? How will it end?" \u2014
p431
aVto nine-year-olds.
p432
aVThis one is about what happens to the air we breathe.
p433
aVThis is done by children without the help of any teacher.
p434
aVThe teacher only raises the question,
p435
aVand then stands back and admires the answer.
p436
aa(lp437
VSo what's my wish?
p438
aVMy wish is
p439
aVthat we design the future of learning.
p440
aVWe don't want to be spare parts
p441
aVfor a great human computer, do we?
p442
aVSo we need to design a future for learning.
p443
aVAnd I've got to \u2014 hang on,
p444
aVI've got to get this wording exactly right,
p445
aVbecause, you know, it's very important.
p446
aVMy wish is to help design a future of learning
p447
aVby supporting children all over the world
p448
aVto tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
p449
aVHelp me build this school.
p450
aVIt will be called the School in the Cloud.
p451
aVIt will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures
p452
aVdriven by the big questions which their mediators put in.
p453
aVThe way I want to do this
p454
aVis to build a facility where I can study this.
p455
aVIt's a facility which is practically unmanned.
p456
aVThere's only one granny
p457
aVwho manages health and safety.
p458
aVThe rest of it's from the cloud.
p459
