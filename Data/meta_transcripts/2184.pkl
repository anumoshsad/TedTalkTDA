VWhat's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health?
p4
aVCancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?
p5
aVThe answer is actually none of these;
p6
aVit's Alzheimer's disease.
p7
aVEvery 67 seconds,
p8
aVsomeone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
p9
aVAs the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year 2050,
p10
aVcaring for them, as well as the rest of the aging population,
p11
aVwill become an overwhelming societal challenge.
p12
aa(lp13
VMy family has experienced firsthand
p14
aVthe struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient.
p15
aVGrowing up in a family with three generations,
p16
aVI've always been very close to my grandfather.
p17
aVWhen I was four years old,
p18
aVmy grandfather and I  were walking in a park in Japan
p19
aVwhen he suddenly got lost.
p20
aVIt was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life,
p21
aVand it was also the first instance that informed us
p22
aVthat my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease.
p23
aVOver the past 12 years, his condition got worse and worse,
p24
aVand his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress.
p25
aVMy aunt, his primary caregiver,
p26
aVreally struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him,
p27
aVand even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed.
p28
aVI became really concerned about my aunt's well-being
p29
aVas well as my grandfather's safety.
p30
aVI searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems,
p31
aVbut couldn't find one.
p32
aa(lp33
VThen, one night about two years ago,
p34
aVI was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed.
p35
aVThe moment his foot landed on the floor,
p36
aVI thought, why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?
p37
aVOnce he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed,
p38
aVthe pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight
p39
aVand then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone.
p40
aVThat way, my aunt could sleep much better at night
p41
aVwithout having to worry about my grandfather's wandering.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock.
p44
aVCould I please have my sock model on the stage?
p45
aVGreat.
p46
aVSo once the patient steps onto the floor \u2014
p47
aV(Ringing) \u2014
p48
aVan alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone.
p49
aa(lp50
VThank you. (Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VThank you, sock model.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo this is a drawing of my preliminary design.
p55
aa(lp56
VMy desire to create a sensor-based technology
p57
aVperhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology.
p58
aVWhen I was six years old,
p59
aVan elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom
p60
aVand suffered severe injuries.
p61
aVI became concerned about my own grandparents
p62
aVand decided to invent a smart bathroom system.
p63
aVMotion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors
p64
aVto detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom.
p65
aVSince I was only six years old at the time
p66
aVand I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet,
p67
aVI didn't have the necessary resources and  tools to translate my idea into reality,
p68
aVbut nonetheless, my research experience
p69
aVreally implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people.
p70
aVI really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly.
p71
aa(lp72
VWhen I laid out my plan, I realized that I faced three main challenges:
p73
aVfirst, creating a sensor;
p74
aVsecond, designing a circuit;
p75
aVand third, coding a smartphone app.
p76
aVThis made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize
p77
aVthan I initially had thought it to be.
p78
aa(lp79
VFirst, I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough
p80
aVto be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot.
p81
aVAfter extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber,
p82
aVwhich I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot,
p83
aVI decided to print a film sensor
p84
aVwith electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles.
p85
aVOnce pressure is applied, the connectivity between the particles increases.
p86
aVTherefore, I could design a circuit that would measure pressure
p87
aVby measuring electrical resistance.
p88
aa(lp89
VNext, I had to design a wearable wireless circuit,
p90
aVbut wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power
p91
aVand requires heavy, bulky batteries.
p92
aVThankfully, I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology,
p93
aVwhich consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.
p94
aVThis prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night.
p95
aa(lp96
VLastly, I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform
p97
aVthe care-giver's smartphone into a remote monitor.
p98
aVFor this, I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode
p99
aVand I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices
p100
aVby watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks.
p101
aa(lp102
VIntegrating these components, I was able to successfully create two prototypes,
p103
aVone in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock,
p104
aVand another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly
p105
aVthat can be adhered anywhere that makes contact
p106
aVwith the bottom of the patient's foot.
p107
aVI've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now,
p108
aVand it's had a 100 percent success rate
p109
aVin detecting the over 900  known cases of his wandering.
p110
aVLast summer, I was able to beta test my device
p111
aVat several residential care facilities in California,
p112
aVand I'm currently incorporating the feedback
p113
aVto further improve the device  into a marketable product.
p114
aVTesting the device on a number of patients
p115
aVmade me realize that I needed to invent solutions
p116
aVfor people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo sensor data, collected on a vast number of patients,
p119
aVcan be useful for improving patient care
p120
aVand also leading to a cure for the disease, possibly.
p121
aVFor example, I'm currently examining
p122
aVcorrelations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering
p123
aVand his or her daily activities and diet.
p124
aa(lp125
VOne thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught
p126
aVmy grandfather's wandering out of bed at night.
p127
aVAt that moment, I was really struck by the power of technology
p128
aVto change lives for the better.
p129
aVPeople living happily and healthfully \u2014
p130
aVthat's the world that I imagine.
p131
