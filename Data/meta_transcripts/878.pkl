VOne thing the world needs,
p4
aVone thing this country desperately needs
p5
aVis a better way
p6
aVof conducting our political debates.
p7
aVWe need to rediscover
p8
aVthe lost art of democratic argument.
p9
aV(Applause)
p10
aVIf you think about the arguments we have,
p11
aVmost of the time it's shouting matches
p12
aVon cable television,
p13
aVideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
p14
aVI have a suggestion.
p15
aVLook at all the arguments we have these days
p16
aVover health care,
p17
aVover bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,
p18
aVover the gap between rich and poor,
p19
aVover affirmative action and same-sex marriage.
p20
aVLying just beneath the surface
p21
aVof those arguments,
p22
aVwith passions raging on all sides,
p23
aVare big questions
p24
aVof moral philosophy,
p25
aVbig questions of justice.
p26
aVBut we too rarely
p27
aVarticulate and defend
p28
aVand argue about
p29
aVthose big moral questions in our politics.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo what I would like to do today
p32
aVis have something of a discussion.
p33
aVFirst, let me take
p34
aVa famous philosopher
p35
aVwho wrote about those questions
p36
aVof justice and morality,
p37
aVgive you a very short lecture
p38
aVon Aristotle of ancient Athens,
p39
aVAristotle's theory of justice,
p40
aVand then have a discussion here
p41
aVto see whether Aristotle's ideas
p42
aVactually inform
p43
aVthe way we think and argue
p44
aVabout questions today.
p45
aVSo, are you ready for the lecture?
p46
aVAccording to Aristotle,
p47
aVjustice means giving people what they deserve.
p48
aVThat's it; that's the lecture.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.
p53
aVThe real questions begin
p54
aVwhen it comes to arguing about
p55
aVwho deserves what and why.
p56
aVTake the example of flutes.
p57
aVSuppose we're distributing flutes.
p58
aVWho should get the best ones?
p59
aVLet's see what people \u2014
p60
aVWhat would you say?
p61
aVWho should get the best flute?
p62
aVYou can just call it out.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Audience: Random.)
p65
aa(lp66
VMichael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.
p67
aVOr by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.
p68
aVWho else?
p69
aa(lp70
V(Audience: The best flute players.)
p71
aa(lp72
VMS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)
p73
aa(lp74
VMS: The worst flute players.
p75
aVHow many say the best flute players?
p76
aVWhy?
p77
aVActually, that was Aristotle's answer too.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VBut here's a harder question.
p82
aVWhy do you think,
p83
aVthose of you who voted this way,
p84
aVthat the best flutes should go to the best flute players?
p85
aa(lp86
VPeter: The greatest benefit to all.
p87
aa(lp88
VMS: The greatest benefit to all.
p89
aVWe'll hear better music
p90
aVif the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
p91
aVThat's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)
p92
aa(lp93
VMS: All right.
p94
aVWell, it's a good reason.
p95
aVWe'll all be better off if good music is played
p96
aVrather than terrible music.
p97
aVBut Peter,
p98
aVAristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.
p99
aVThat's all right.
p100
aVAristotle had a different reason
p101
aVfor saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
p102
aVHe said,
p103
aVthat's what flutes are for \u2014
p104
aVto be played well.
p105
aVHe says that to reason about
p106
aVjust distribution of a thing,
p107
aVwe have to reason about,
p108
aVand sometimes argue about,
p109
aVthe purpose of the thing,
p110
aVor the social activity \u2014
p111
aVin this case, musical performance.
p112
aVAnd the point, the essential nature,
p113
aVof musical performance
p114
aVis to produce excellent music.
p115
aVIt'll be a happy byproduct
p116
aVthat we'll all benefit.
p117
aVBut when we think about justice,
p118
aVAristotle says,
p119
aVwhat we really need to think about
p120
aVis the essential nature of the activity in question
p121
aVand the qualities that are worth
p122
aVhonoring and admiring and recognizing.
p123
aVOne of the reasons
p124
aVthat the best flute players should get the best flutes
p125
aVis that musical performance
p126
aVis not only to make the rest of us happy,
p127
aVbut to honor
p128
aVand recognize
p129
aVthe excellence
p130
aVof the best musicians.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes
p133
aVmay seem a trivial case.
p134
aVLet's take a contemporary example
p135
aVof the dispute about justice.
p136
aVIt had to do with golf.
p137
aVCasey Martin \u2014 a few years ago,
p138
aVCasey Martin \u2014
p139
aVdid any of you hear about him?
p140
aVHe was a very good golfer,
p141
aVbut he had a disability.
p142
aVHe had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,
p143
aVthat made it very painful
p144
aVfor him to walk the course.
p145
aVIn fact, it carried risk of injury.
p146
aVHe asked the PGA,
p147
aVthe Professional Golfers' Association,
p148
aVfor permission to use a golf cart
p149
aVin the PGA tournaments.
p150
aVThey said, "No.
p151
aVNow that would give you an unfair advantage."
p152
aVHe sued,
p153
aVand his case went all the way
p154
aVto the Supreme Court, believe it or not,
p155
aVthe case over the golf cart,
p156
aVbecause the law says
p157
aVthat the disabled
p158
aVmust be accommodated,
p159
aVprovided the accommodation does not
p160
aVchange the essential nature
p161
aVof the activity.
p162
aVHe says, "I'm a great golfer.
p163
aVI want to compete.
p164
aVBut I need a golf cart
p165
aVto get from one hole to the next."
p166
aa(lp167
VSuppose you were
p168
aVon the Supreme Court.
p169
aVSuppose you were deciding
p170
aVthe justice of this case.
p171
aVHow many here would say
p172
aVthat Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?
p173
aVAnd how many say, no, he doesn't?
p174
aVAll right, let's take a poll, show of hands.
p175
aVHow many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?
p176
aVAnd how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?
p177
aVAll right, we have a good division of opinion here.
p178
aVSomeone who would not
p179
aVgrant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,
p180
aVwhat would be your reason?
p181
aVRaise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.
p182
aVWhat would be your reason?
p183
aa(lp184
V(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)
p185
aa(lp186
VMS: It would be an unfair advantage
p187
aVif he gets to ride in a golf cart.
p188
aVAll right, those of you,
p189
aVI imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart
p190
aVworry about an unfair advantage.
p191
aVWhat about those of you who say
p192
aVhe should be given a golf cart?
p193
aVHow would you answer the objection?
p194
aVYes, all right.
p195
aa(lp196
VAudience: The cart's not part of the game.
p197
aa(lp198
VMS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)
p199
aa(lp200
VMS: Charlie says \u2014
p201
aVWe'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
p202
aVTell us, Charlie,
p203
aVwhy would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?
p204
aa(lp205
VCharlie: The cart's not part of the game.
p206
aa(lp207
VMS: But what about walking from hole to hole?
p208
aa(lp209
VCharlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.
p210
aa(lp211
VMS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?
p212
aa(lp213
VCharlie: Not in my book, it isn't.
p214
aa(lp215
VMS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VWho has an answer for Charlie?
p220
aVAll right, who has an answer for Charlie?
p221
aVWhat would you say?
p222
aa(lp223
VAudience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,
p224
aVwalking all those holes.
p225
aa(lp226
VMS: Walking all those holes?
p227
aVThat's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)
p228
aa(lp229
VMS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)
p230
aa(lp231
VMS: Warren.
p232
aVCharlie, what do you say to Warren?
p233
aa(lp234
VCharley: I'll stick to my original thesis.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VMS: Warren, are you a golfer?
p239
aa(lp240
VWarren: I am not a golfer.
p241
aa(lp242
VCharley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
V(Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VYou know,
p248
aVit's interesting.
p249
aVIn the case, in the lower court,
p250
aVthey brought in golfing greats
p251
aVto testify on this very issue.
p252
aVIs walking the course essential to the game?
p253
aVAnd they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
p254
aVAnd what do you suppose they all said?
p255
aVYes. They agreed with Warren.
p256
aVThey said, yes, walking the course
p257
aVis strenuous physical exercise.
p258
aVThe fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
p259
aVAnd so it would change
p260
aVthe fundamental nature of the game
p261
aVto give him the golf cart.
p262
aVNow, notice,
p263
aVsomething interesting \u2014
p264
aVWell, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.
p265
aa(lp266
VThe Supreme Court
p267
aVdecided.
p268
aVWhat do you suppose they said?
p269
aVThey said yes,
p270
aVthat Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.
p271
aVSeven to two, they ruled.
p272
aVWhat was interesting about their ruling
p273
aVand about the discussion we've just had
p274
aVis that the discussion about
p275
aVthe right, the justice, of the matter
p276
aVdepended on
p277
aVfiguring out what is
p278
aVthe essential nature of golf.
p279
aVAnd the Supreme Court justices
p280
aVwrestled with that question.
p281
aVAnd Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,
p282
aVsaid he had read all about the history of golf,
p283
aVand the essential point of the game
p284
aVis to get very small ball from one place
p285
aVinto a hole
p286
aVin as few strokes as possible,
p287
aVand that walking was not essential, but incidental.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, there were two dissenters,
p290
aVone of whom was Justice Scalia.
p291
aVHe wouldn't have granted the cart,
p292
aVand he had a very interesting dissent.
p293
aVIt's interesting because
p294
aVhe rejected the Aristotelian premise
p295
aVunderlying the majority's opinion.
p296
aVHe said it's not possible
p297
aVto determine the essential nature
p298
aVof a game like golf.
p299
aVHere's how he put it.
p300
aV"To say that something is essential
p301
aVis ordinarily to say that it is necessary
p302
aVto the achievement of a certain object.
p303
aVBut since it is the very nature of a game
p304
aVto have no object except amusement,
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVthat is, what distinguishes games
p307
aVfrom productive activity,
p308
aV(Laughter)
p309
aVit is quite impossible to say
p310
aVthat any of a game's arbitrary rules
p311
aVis essential."
p312
aa(lp313
VSo there you have Justice Scalia
p314
aVtaking on the Aristotelian premise
p315
aVof the majority's opinion.
p316
aVJustice Scalia's opinion
p317
aVis questionable
p318
aVfor two reasons.
p319
aVFirst, no real sports fan would talk that way.
p320
aV(Laughter)
p321
aVIf we had thought that the rules
p322
aVof the sports we care about
p323
aVare merely arbitrary,
p324
aVrather than designed to call forth
p325
aVthe virtues and the excellences
p326
aVthat we think are worthy of admiring,
p327
aVwe wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.
p328
aVIt's also objectionable
p329
aVon a second ground.
p330
aVOn the face of it,
p331
aVit seemed to be \u2014 this debate about the golf cart \u2014
p332
aVan argument about fairness,
p333
aVwhat's an unfair advantage.
p334
aVBut if fairness were the only thing at stake,
p335
aVthere would have been an easy and obvious solution.
p336
aVWhat would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)
p337
aVLet everyone ride in a golf cart
p338
aVif they want to.
p339
aVThen the fairness objection goes away.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut letting everyone ride in a cart
p342
aVwould have been, I suspect,
p343
aVmore anathema
p344
aVto the golfing greats
p345
aVand to the PGA,
p346
aVeven than making an exception for Casey Martin.
p347
aVWhy?
p348
aVBecause what was at stake
p349
aVin the dispute over the golf cart
p350
aVwas not only the essential nature of golf,
p351
aVbut, relatedly, the question:
p352
aVWhat abilities
p353
aVare worthy
p354
aVof honor and recognition
p355
aVas athletic talents?
p356
aVLet me put the point
p357
aVas delicately as possible:
p358
aVGolfers are a little sensitive
p359
aVabout the athletic status of their game.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aVAfter all, there's no running or jumping,
p362
aVand the ball stands still.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVSo if golfing is the kind of game
p365
aVthat can be played while riding around in a golf cart,
p366
aVit would be hard to confer
p367
aVon the golfing greats
p368
aVthe status that we confer,
p369
aVthe honor and recognition
p370
aVthat goes to truly great athletes.
p371
aVThat illustrates
p372
aVthat with golf,
p373
aVas with flutes,
p374
aVit's hard to decide the question
p375
aVof what justice requires,
p376
aVwithout grappling with the question,
p377
aV"What is the essential nature
p378
aVof the activity in question,
p379
aVand what qualities,
p380
aVwhat excellences
p381
aVconnected with that activity,
p382
aVare worthy of honor and recognition?"
p383
aa(lp384
VLet's take a final example
p385
aVthat's prominent in contemporary political debate:
p386
aVsame-sex marriage.
p387
aVThere are those who favor state recognition
p388
aVonly of traditional marriage
p389
aVbetween one man and one woman,
p390
aVand there are those who favor state recognition
p391
aVof same-sex marriage.
p392
aVHow many here
p393
aVfavor the first policy:
p394
aVthe state should recognize traditional marriage only?
p395
aVAnd how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?
p396
aVNow, put it this way:
p397
aVWhat ways of thinking
p398
aVabout justice and morality
p399
aVunderlie the arguments we have
p400
aVover marriage?
p401
aVThe opponents of same-sex marriage say
p402
aVthat the purpose of marriage,
p403
aVfundamentally, is procreation,
p404
aVand that's what's worthy of honoring
p405
aVand recognizing and encouraging.
p406
aVAnd the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,
p407
aVprocreation is not the only purpose of marriage;
p408
aVwhat about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
p409
aVThat's really what marriage is about.
p410
aVSo with flutes, with golf carts,
p411
aVand even with a fiercely contested question
p412
aVlike same-sex marriage,
p413
aVAristotle has a point.
p414
aVVery hard to argue about justice
p415
aVwithout first arguing
p416
aVabout the purpose of social institutions
p417
aVand about what qualities are worthy
p418
aVof honor and recognition.
p419
aa(lp420
VSo let's step back from these cases
p421
aVand see how they shed light
p422
aVon the way we might improve, elevate,
p423
aVthe terms of political discourse
p424
aVin the United States,
p425
aVand for that matter, around the world.
p426
aVThere is a tendency to think
p427
aVthat if we engage too directly
p428
aVwith moral questions in politics,
p429
aVthat's a recipe for disagreement,
p430
aVand for that matter, a recipe for
p431
aVintolerance and coercion.
p432
aVSo better to shy away from,
p433
aVto ignore,
p434
aVthe moral and the religious convictions
p435
aVthat people bring to civic life.
p436
aVIt seems to me that our discussion
p437
aVreflects the opposite,
p438
aVthat a better way
p439
aVto mutual respect
p440
aVis to engage directly
p441
aVwith the moral convictions
p442
aVcitizens bring to public life,
p443
aVrather than to require
p444
aVthat people leave their deepest moral convictions
p445
aVoutside politics
p446
aVbefore they enter.
p447
aVThat, it seems to me, is a way
p448
aVto begin to restore
p449
aVthe art of democratic argument.
p450
aa(lp451
VThank you very much.
p452
aa(lp453
V(Applause)
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.

p458
aa(lp459

p462
aa(lp463

p464
aVThanks. Thank you.
p465
aVChris.
p466
aVThanks, Chris.
p467
aa(lp468
VChris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses
p469
aVto same-sex marriage \u2014
p470
aVthat was a genius link.
p471
aVNow look, you're a pioneer of open education.
p472
aVYour lecture series was one of the first to do it big.
p473
aVWhat's your vision for the next phase of this?
p474
aa(lp475
VMS: Well, I think that it is possible.
p476
aVIn the classroom, we have arguments
p477
aVon some of the most fiercely held
p478
aVmoral convictions that students have
p479
aVabout big public questions.
p480
aVAnd I think we can do that in public life more generally.
p481
aVAnd so my real dream would be
p482
aVto take the public television series
p483
aVthat we've created of the course \u2014
p484
aVit's available now, online,
p485
aVfree for everyone anywhere in the world \u2014
p486
aVand to see whether we can partner with institutions,
p487
aVat universities in China, in India,
p488
aVin Africa, around the world,
p489
aVto try to promote
p490
aVcivic education
p491
aVand also a richer kind
p492
aVof democratic debate.
p493
aa(lp494
VCA: So you picture, at some point,
p495
aVlive, in real time,
p496
aVyou could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,
p497
aVbut with people from China and India joining in?
p498
aa(lp499
VMS: Right. We did a little bit of it here
p500
aVwith 1,500 people in Long Beach,
p501
aVand we do it in a classroom at Harvard
p502
aVwith about 1,000 students.
p503
aVWouldn't it be interesting
p504
aVto take this way
p505
aVof thinking and arguing,
p506
aVengaging seriously with big moral questions,
p507
aVexploring cultural differences
p508
aVand connect through a live video hookup,
p509
aVstudents in Beijing and Mumbai
p510
aVand in Cambridge, Massachusetts
p511
aVand create a global classroom.
p512
aVThat's what I would love to do.
p513
aa(lp514
V(Applause)
p515
aa(lp516
VCA: So, I would imagine
p517
aVthat there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.
