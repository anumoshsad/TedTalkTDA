VOver the last two decades, India has become
p4
aVa global hub for software development
p5
aVand offshoring of back office services, as we call it,
p6
aVand what we were interested in finding out was that
p7
aVbecause of this huge industry that has started
p8
aVover the last two decades in India,
p9
aVoffshoring software development and back office services,
p10
aVthere's been a flight of white collar jobs
p11
aVfrom the developed world to India.
p12
aVWhen this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs
p13
aVto China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst
p14
aVamongst the Western populations.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining
p17
aVtrend for support for free trade in the West.
p18
aVNow, the Western elites, however, have said
p19
aVthis fear is misplaced.
p20
aVFor example, if you have read \u2014 I suspect many of you
p21
aVhave done so \u2014 read the book by Thomas Friedman
p22
aVcalled "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book
p23
aVthat, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong
p24
aVbecause it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption
p25
aVthat everything that can be invented has been invented.
p26
aVIn fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West
p27
aVahead of the developing world,
p28
aVwith the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done
p29
aVin the developed world, and the less sophisticated,
p30
aVshall we say, drudge work being done
p31
aVin the developing world.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, what we were trying to understand was,
p34
aVis this true?
p35
aVCould India become a source, or a global hub,
p36
aVof innovation, just like it's become a global hub
p37
aVfor back office services and software development?
p38
aVAnd for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam
p39
aVand I spent investigating this topic.
p40
aa(lp41
VInitially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,
p42
aVin fact the more aggressive people who are supporting
p43
aVthe Western innovative model, say,
p44
aV"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,
p45
aVif the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VSo initially, when we started our research, we went
p48
aVand met several executives, and we asked them,
p49
aV"What do you think? Will India go from being a favored
p50
aVdestination for software services and back office services
p51
aVto a destination for innovation?"
p52
aVThey laughed. They dismissed us.
p53
aVThey said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."
p54
aVThe more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians
p55
aVmake good software programmers and accountants,
p56
aVbut they can't do the creative stuff."
p57
aa(lp58
VSometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,
p59
aVand people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.
p60
aVIt's really the rule-based, regimented education system
p61
aVin India that is responsible for killing all creativity."
p62
aVThey said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,
p63
aVgo to Silicon Valley, and look at companies
p64
aVlike Google, Microsoft, Intel.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo we started examining the R&D and innovation labs
p67
aVof Silicon Valley.
p68
aVWell, interestingly, what you find there is,
p69
aVusually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab
p70
aVor the R&D center as they may call it,
p71
aVand more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been
p74
aVeducated in India, right?
p75
aVYou must have gotten your education here."
p76
aVIt turned out, in every single case,
p77
aVthey came out of the Indian educational system.
p78
aVSo we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,
p79
aVand the right question is, really, can Indians
p80
aVbased out of India do innovative work?
p81
aa(lp82
VSo off we went to India. We made, I think,
p83
aVabout a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,
p84
aVDelhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine
p85
aVwhat is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
p86
aVAnd what we found was, as we progressed in our research,
p87
aVwas, that we were asking really the wrong question.
p88
aVWhen you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,
p89
aViPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective
p90
aVon innovation, which is innovation for end users,
p91
aVvisible innovation.
p92
aa(lp93
VInstead, innovation, if you remember, some of you
p94
aVmay have read the famous economist Schumpeter,
p95
aVhe said, "Innovation is novelty
p96
aVin how value is created and distributed."
p97
aVIt could be new products and services,
p98
aVbut it could also be new ways of producing products.
p99
aVIt could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
p100
aa(lp101
VOnce you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,
p102
aVthe beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
p103
aVWhen you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,
p104
aVwhat we found was, India is well represented
p105
aVin innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India
p106
aVis of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was
p107
aVwe called it "invisible innovation."
p108
aVAnd specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation
p109
aVthat are coming out of India.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe first type of invisible innovation out of India
p112
aVis what we call innovation for business customers,
p113
aVwhich is led by the multinational corporations,
p114
aVwhich have \u2014 in the last two decades, there have been
p115
aV750 R&D centers set up in India by multinational companies
p116
aVemploying more than 400,000 professionals.
p117
aVNow, when you consider the fact that, historically,
p118
aVthe R&D center of a multinational company
p119
aVwas always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin
p120
aVof that multinational company, to have 750 R&D centers
p121
aVof multinational corporations in India
p122
aVis truly a remarkable figure.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhen we went and talked to the people in those innovation
p125
aVcenters and asked them what are they working on,
p126
aVthey said, "We are working on global products."
p127
aVThey were not working on localizing global products
p128
aVfor India, which is the usual role of a local R&D.
p129
aVThey were working on truly global products,
p130
aVand companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,
p131
aVGeneral Electric, Philips, have already answered
p132
aVin the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore
p133
aVand Hyderabad R&D centers they are able to produce
p134
aVproducts and services for the world.
p135
aVBut of course, as an end user, you don't see that,
p136
aVbecause you only see the name of the company,
p137
aVnot where it was developed.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,
p140
aVthe kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&D center
p141
aVcannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out
p142
aVof the U.S. R&D centers."
p143
aVSo my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be
p144
aVone of the smartest people I know, said
p145
aVhe's going to do a study.
p146
aVWhat he did was he looked at those companies
p147
aVthat had an R&D center in USA and in India,
p148
aVand then he looked at a patent that was filed
p149
aVout of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same
p150
aVcompany's subsidiary in India,
p151
aVso he's now comparing the patents of R&D centers
p152
aVin the U.S. with R&D centers in India of the same company
p153
aVto find out what is the quality of the patents filed
p154
aVout of the Indian centers and how do they compare
p155
aVwith the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
p156
aa(lp157
VInterestingly, what he finds is
p158
aV\u2014 and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent
p159
aVis what we call forward citations: How many times
p160
aVdoes a future patent reference the older patent? \u2014
p161
aVhe finds something very interesting.
p162
aVWhat we find is that the data says
p163
aVthat the number of forward citations of a patent filed
p164
aVout of a U.S. R&D subsidiary is identical to the number
p165
aVof forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary
p166
aVof the same company within that company.
p167
aVSo within the company, there's no difference in the forward
p168
aVcitation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus
p169
aVtheir U.S. subsidiaries.
p170
aVSo that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
p173
aVis what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,
p174
aVwhere many companies today are contracting
p175
aVIndian companies to do a major part of their product
p176
aVdevelopment work for their global products
p177
aVwhich are going to be sold to the entire world.
p178
aVFor example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules
p179
aVare being developed, but you see a major part of that work
p180
aVis being sent to India.
p181
aVFor example, XCL Technologies,
p182
aVthey developed two of the mission critical systems
p183
aVfor the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
p184
aVone to avoid collisions in the sky,
p185
aVand another to allow landing in zero visibility.
p186
aVBut of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,
p187
aVyou are not going to know that this is invisible innovation
p188
aVout of India.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
p191
aVis what we call process innovations, because of an injection
p192
aVof intelligence by Indian firms.
p193
aVProcess innovation is different from product innovation.
p194
aVIt's about how do you create a new product or develop
p195
aVa new product or manufacture a new product,
p196
aVbut not a new product itself?
p197
aa(lp198
VOnly in India do millions of young people dream
p199
aVof working in a call center.
p200
aVWhat happens \u2014 You know, it's a dead end job in the West,
p201
aVwhat high school dropouts do.
p202
aVWhat happens when you put hundreds of thousands
p203
aVof smart, young, ambitious kids
p204
aVon a call center job?
p205
aVVery quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,
p206
aVand they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and
p207
aVout of this process innovation comes product innovations,
p208
aVwhich are then marketed around the world.
p209
aa(lp210
VFor example, 24/7 Customer,
p211
aVtraditional call center company, used to be a traditional
p212
aVcall center company. Today they're developing
p213
aVanalytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before
p214
aVyou pick up the phone, you can guess
p215
aVor predict what this phone call is about.
p216
aVIt's because of an injection of intelligence into a process
p217
aVwhich was considered dead for a long time in the West.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation
p220
aVcoming out of India is what we call management innovation.
p221
aVIt's not a new product or a new process
p222
aVbut a new way to organize work,
p223
aVand the most significant management innovation to come
p224
aVout of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry
p225
aVis what we call the global delivery model.
p226
aVWhat the global delivery model allows is, it allows you
p227
aVto take previously geographically core-located tasks,
p228
aVbreak them up into parts, send them around the world
p229
aVwhere the expertise and the cost structure exists,
p230
aVand then specify the means for reintegrating them.
p231
aVWithout that, you could not have any of the other
p232
aVinvisible innovations today.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding
p235
aVin our research is, that if products for end users
p236
aVis the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,
p237
aVIndia is well represented in the invisible, large,
p238
aVsubmerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, this has, of course, some implications,
p241
aVand so we developed three implications of this research.
p242
aVThe first is what we called sinking skill ladder,
p243
aVand now I'm going to go back to where I started my
p244
aVconversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
p245
aVNow, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,
p246
aVdecide to outsource jobs to India in the R&D,
p247
aVwhat we are going to do is we are going to outsource the
p248
aVbottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,
p249
aVjust like Tom Friedman would predict.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung
p252
aVof the ladder to India for innovation and for R&D work,
p253
aVat some stage in the very near future you are going to have
p254
aVto confront a problem,
p255
aVwhich is where does the next step
p256
aVof the ladder people come from within your company?
p257
aVSo you have two choices then:
p258
aVEither you bring the people from India into
p259
aVthe developed world to take positions in the next step
p260
aVof the ladder \u2014 immigration \u2014
p261
aVor you say, there's so many people in the bottom step
p262
aVof the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,
p263
aVwhy don't we move the next step to India?
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat we are trying to say is
p266
aVthat once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you \u2014
p267
aVit's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,
p268
aVand the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
p269
aVyou can't be an investment banker
p270
aVwithout having been an analyst once.
p271
aVYou can't be a professor without having been a student.
p272
aVYou can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.
p273
aVSo, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,
p274
aVat some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe second thing we bring up is what we call
p277
aVthe browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
p278
aVIf the R&D talent is going to be based out of India
p279
aVand China, and the largest growth markets
p280
aVare going to be based out of India and China,
p281
aVyou have to confront the problem that
p282
aVyour top management of the future
p283
aVis going to have to come out of India and China,
p284
aVbecause that's where the product leadership is,
p285
aVthat's where the important market leadership is.
p286
aa(lp287
VRight? And the last thing we point out in this slide,
p288
aVwhich is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.
p289
aVIndia has the youngest growing population in the world.
p290
aVThis demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,
p291
aVthere's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
p292
aVIndian institutes and educational system,
p293
aVwith a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students
p294
aVin the quantity and quality needed
p295
aVto keep this innovation engine going,
p296
aVso companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,
p297
aVbut in the end it does not absolve the government
p298
aVof the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo finally, I want to conclude
p301
aVby showing you the profile of one company, IBM.
p302
aVAs many of you know, IBM has always been considered
p303
aVfor the last hundred years to be one of the most
p304
aVinnovative companies.
p305
aVIn fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,
p306
aVI think they are in the top or the top two or three companies
p307
aVin the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.
p308
aa(lp309
VHere is the profile of employees of
p310
aVIBM over the last decade.
p311
aVIn 2003, they had 300,000 employees,
p312
aVor 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000
p313
aVwere in America, 9,000 were in India.
p314
aVIn 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time
p315
aVthe U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,
p316
aVwhereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.
p317
aa(lp318
VWell, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal
p319
aVthis data anymore, so I had to make some estimates
p320
aVbased on various sources.
p321
aVHere are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying
p322
aVthis is the exact number, it's my best guess.
p323
aVIt gives you a sense of the trend.
p324
aVThere are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which
p325
aV98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,
p326
aVand 150,000 are in India.
p327
aVSo you tell me, is IBM an American company,
p328
aVor an Indian company? (Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
