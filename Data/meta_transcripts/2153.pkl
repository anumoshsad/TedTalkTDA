VToday I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love.
p4
aVNow, I think that we can all agree
p5
aVthat mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBut it's not just because of our dashing personalities,
p10
aVsuperior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases.
p11
aVIt's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths
p12
aVof how to find the perfect partner.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, in my favorite paper on the subject, which is entitled,
p15
aV"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" \u2014
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VPeter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love.
p20
aVNow, Peter's not a very greedy man.
p21
aVOf all of the available women in the UK,
p22
aVall Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him,
p23
aVsomebody in the right age range,
p24
aVsomebody with a university degree,
p25
aVsomebody he's likely to get on well with,
p26
aVsomebody who's likely to be attractive,
p27
aVsomebody who's likely to find him attractive.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd comes up with an estimate of 26 women in the whole of the UK.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's not looking very good, is it Peter?
p36
aVNow, just to put that into perspective,
p37
aVthat's about 400 times fewer than the best estimates
p38
aVof how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are.
p39
aVAnd it also gives Peter a 1 in 285,000 chance
p40
aVof bumping into any one of these special ladies
p41
aVon a given night out.
p42
aVI'd like to think that's why mathematicians
p43
aVdon't really bother going on nights out anymore.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe thing is that I personally don't subscribe
p46
aVto such a pessimistic view.
p47
aVBecause I know, just as well as all of you do,
p48
aVthat love doesn't really work like that.
p49
aVHuman emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable.
p50
aVBut I also know that that doesn't mean
p51
aVthat mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us,
p52
aVbecause, love, as with most of life, is full of patterns
p53
aVand mathematics is, ultimately, all about the study of patterns.
p54
aVPatterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market,
p55
aVto the movement of the planets or the growth of cities.
p56
aVAnd if we're being honest, none of those things
p57
aVare exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable, either.
p58
aVBecause I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential
p59
aVto offer us a new way of looking at almost anything.
p60
aVEven something as mysterious as love.
p61
aVAnd so, to try to persuade you
p62
aVof how totally amazing, excellent and relevant mathematics is,
p63
aVI want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VOK, so Top Tip #1:
p68
aVHow to win at online dating.
p69
aVSo my favorite online dating website is OkCupid,
p70
aVnot least because it was started by a group of mathematicians.
p71
aVNow, because they're mathematicians,
p72
aVthey have been collecting data
p73
aVon everybody who uses their site for almost a decade.
p74
aVAnd they've been trying to search for patterns
p75
aVin the way that we talk about ourselves
p76
aVand the way that we interact with each other
p77
aVon an online dating website.
p78
aVAnd they've come up with some seriously interesting findings.
p79
aVBut my particular favorite
p80
aVis that it turns out that on an online dating website,
p81
aVhow attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are,
p82
aVand actually, having people think that you're ugly
p83
aVcan work to your advantage.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VLet me show you how this works.
p88
aVIn a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid,
p89
aVyou are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are
p90
aVon a scale between one and five.
p91
aVNow, if we compare this score, the average score,
p92
aVto how many messages a selection of people receive,
p93
aVyou can begin to get a sense
p94
aVof how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is the graph the OkCupid guys have come up with.
p97
aVAnd the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true
p98
aVthat the more attractive you are, the more messages you get.
p99
aVBut the question arises then of what is it about people up here
p100
aVwho are so much more popular than people down here,
p101
aVeven though they have the same score of attractiveness?
p102
aVAnd the reason why is that it's not just straightforward looks that are important.
p103
aVSo let me try to illustrate their findings with an example.
p104
aVSo if you take someone like Portia de Rossi, for example,
p105
aVeverybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman.
p106
aVNobody thinks that she's ugly, but she's not a supermodel, either.
p107
aVIf you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,
p108
aVnow, a lot of people, myself included, I should say,
p109
aVthink that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous
p110
aVand possibly one of the most beautiful creatures
p111
aVto have ever have walked on the face of the Earth.
p112
aVBut some other people, i.e., most of the Internet ...
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
Vseem to think that she looks a bit like a horse.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought
p121
aVJessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,
p122
aVand you ask them to give them a score between one and five
p123
aVI reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score.
p124
aVBut the way that people would vote would be very different.
p125
aVSo Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four
p126
aVbecause everybody agrees that she's very beautiful,
p127
aVwhereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion.
p128
aVThere'd be a huge spread in her scores.
p129
aVAnd actually it's this spread that counts.
p130
aVIt's this spread that makes you more popular
p131
aVon an online Internet dating website.
p132
aVSo what that means then
p133
aVis that if some people think that you're attractive,
p134
aVyou're actually better off
p135
aVhaving some other people think that you're a massive minger.
p136
aVThat's much better than everybody just thinking
p137
aVthat you're the cute girl next door.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, I think this begins to make a bit more sense
p140
aVwhen you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages.
p141
aVSo let's say that you think somebody's attractive,
p142
aVbut you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested.
p143
aVThat means there's less competition for you
p144
aVand it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch.
p145
aVWhereas compare that to if you think somebody is attractive
p146
aVbut you suspect that everybody is going to think they're attractive.
p147
aVWell, why would you bother humiliating yourself, let's be honest?
p148
aVBut here's where the really interesting part comes.
p149
aVBecause when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website,
p150
aVthey often try to minimize the things
p151
aVthat they think some people will find unattractive.
p152
aVThe classic example is people who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight
p153
aVdeliberately choosing a very cropped photo,
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
Vor bald men, for example,
p158
aVdeliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats.
p159
aVBut actually this is the opposite of what you should do
p160
aVif you want to be successful.
p161
aVYou should really, instead,
p162
aVplay up to whatever it is that makes you different,
p163
aVeven if you think that some people will find it unattractive.
p164
aVBecause the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway,
p165
aVand the unimportant losers who don't, well, they only play up to your advantage.
p166
aa(lp167
VOK, Top Tip #2: How to pick the perfect partner.
p168
aVSo let's imagine then that you're a roaring success
p169
aVon the dating scene.
p170
aVBut the question arises of how do you then convert that success
p171
aVinto longer-term happiness,
p172
aVand in particular, how do you decide when is the right time to settle down?
p173
aVNow generally, it's not advisable to just cash in
p174
aVand marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all.
p175
aVBut, equally, you don't really want to leave it too long
p176
aVif you want to maximize your chance of long-term happiness.
p177
aVAs my favorite author, Jane Austen, puts it,
p178
aV"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty
p179
aVcan never hope to feel or inspire affection again."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VThanks a lot, Jane.
p184
aVWhat do you know about love?
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VSo the question is then,
p189
aVhow do you know when is the right time to settle down,
p190
aVgiven all the people that you can date in your lifetime?
p191
aVThankfully, there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use
p192
aVto help us out here, called optimal stopping theory.
p193
aVSo let's imagine, then,
p194
aVthat you start dating when you're 15
p195
aVand ideally, you'd like to be married by the time that you're 35.
p196
aVAnd there's a number of people
p197
aVthat you could potentially date across your lifetime,
p198
aVand they'll be at varying levels of goodness.
p199
aVNow the rules are that once you cash in and get married,
p200
aVyou can't look ahead to see what you could have had,
p201
aVand equally, you can't go back and change your mind.
p202
aVIn my experience at least,
p203
aVI find that typically people don't much like being recalled
p204
aVyears after being passed up for somebody else, or that's just me.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo the math says then that what you should do
p207
aVin the first 37 percent of your dating window,
p208
aVyou should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd then, you should pick the next person that comes along
p213
aVthat is better than everybody that you've seen before.
p214
aVSo here's the example.
p215
aVNow if you do this, it can be mathematically proven, in fact,
p216
aVthat this is the best possible way
p217
aVof maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner.
p218
aVNow unfortunately, I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks.
p219
aVFor instance, imagine if your perfect partner appeared
p220
aVduring your first 37 percent.
p221
aVNow, unfortunately, you'd have to reject them.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, if you're following the maths,
p226
aVI'm afraid no one else comes along
p227
aVthat's better than anyone you've seen before,
p228
aVso you have to go on rejecting everyone and die alone.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VProbably surrounded by cats ...
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
Vnibbling at your remains.
p237
aa(lp238
VOK, another risk is, let's imagine, instead,
p239
aVthat the first people that you dated in your first 37 percent
p240
aVare just incredibly dull, boring, terrible people.
p241
aVThat's OK, because you're in your rejection phase,
p242
aVso that's fine, you can reject them.
p243
aVBut then imagine the next person to come along
p244
aVis just marginally less boring, dull and terrible ...
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
Vthan everybody that you've seen before.
p249
aVNow, if you are following the maths, I'm afraid you have to marry them ...
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
Vand end up in a relationship which is, frankly, suboptimal.
p254
aVSorry about that.
p255
aVBut I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on
p256
aVand really cater for this market.
p257
aVA Valentine's Day card like this.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
V"My darling husband, you are marginally less terrible
p262
aVthan the first 37 percent of people I dated."
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VIt's actually more romantic than I normally manage.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VOK, so this method doesn't give you a 100 percent success rate,
p271
aVbut there's no other possible strategy that can do any better.
p272
aVAnd actually, in the wild, there are certain types of fish
p273
aVwhich follow and employ this exact strategy.
p274
aVSo they reject every possible suitor that turns up
p275
aVin the first 37 percent of the mating season,
p276
aVand then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window
p277
aVthat's, I don't know, bigger and burlier
p278
aVthan all of the fish that they've seen before.
p279
aVI also think that subconsciously, humans, we do sort of do this anyway.
p280
aVWe give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field,
p281
aVget a feel for the marketplace or whatever when we're young.
p282
aVAnd then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates
p283
aVonce we hit our mid-to-late 20s.
p284
aVI think this is conclusive proof, if ever it were needed,
p285
aVthat everybody's brains are prewired to be just a little bit mathematical.
p286
aa(lp287
VOK, so that was Top Tip #2.
p288
aVNow, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.
p289
aVOK, so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner
p290
aVand you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them.
p291
aVNow, I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce,
p292
aVapart from, I don't know, Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VBut it's a sad fact of modern life
p297
aVthat one in two marriages in the States ends in divorce,
p298
aVwith the rest of the world not being far behind.
p299
aVNow, you can be forgiven, perhaps
p300
aVfor thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup
p301
aVare not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation.
p302
aVFor one thing, it's very hard to know
p303
aVwhat you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying.
p304
aVBut this didn't stop a psychologist, John Gottman, who did exactly that.
p305
aVGottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation
p306
aVand recorded, well, everything you can think of.
p307
aVSo he recorded what was said in the conversation,
p308
aVhe recorded their skin conductivity,
p309
aVhe recorded their facial expressions,
p310
aVtheir heart rates, their blood pressure,
p311
aVbasically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right,
p312
aVwhich incidentally she totally is.
p313
aVBut what Gottman and his team found
p314
aVwas that one of the most important predictors
p315
aVfor whether or not a couple is going to get divorced
p316
aVwas how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, couples that were very low-risk
p319
aVscored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative.
p320
aVWhereas bad relationships,
p321
aVby which I mean, probably going to get divorced,
p322
aVthey found themselves getting into a spiral of negativity.
p323
aVNow just by using these very simple ideas,
p324
aVGottman and his group were able to predict
p325
aVwhether a given couple was going to get divorced
p326
aVwith a 90 percent accuracy.
p327
aVBut it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician, James Murray,
p328
aVthat they really started to understand
p329
aVwhat causes these negativity spirals and how they occur.
p330
aVAnd the results that they found,
p331
aVI think, are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting.
p332
aVSo these equations predict how the wife or husband is going to respond
p333
aVin their next turn of the conversation,
p334
aVhow positive or negative they're going to be.
p335
aVAnd these equations depend on
p336
aVthe mood of the person when they're on their own,
p337
aVthe mood of the person when they're with their partner,
p338
aVbut most importantly, they depend on
p339
aVhow much the husband and wife influence one another.
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, I think it's important to point out at this stage,
p342
aVthat these exact equations have also been shown
p343
aVto be perfectly able at describing
p344
aVwhat happens between two countries in an arms race.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VSo that an arguing couple spiraling into negativity
p349
aVand teetering on the brink of divorce
p350
aVis actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VBut the really important term in this equation
p355
aVis the influence that people have on one another,
p356
aVand in particular, something called "the negativity threshold."
p357
aVNow, the negativity threshold,
p358
aVyou can think of as how annoying the husband can be
p359
aVbefore the wife starts to get really pissed off, and vice versa.
p360
aVNow, I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding
p361
aVand allowing the person to have the space to be themselves.
p362
aVSo I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships
p363
aVwere ones where there was a really high negativity threshold.
p364
aVWhere couples let things go
p365
aVand only brought things up if they really were a big deal.
p366
aVBut actually, the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team
p367
aVhave shown the exact opposite is true.
p368
aVThe best couples, or the most successful couples,
p369
aVare the ones with a really low negativity threshold.
p370
aVThese are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed
p371
aVand allow each other some room to complain.
p372
aVThese are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship,
p373
aVthat have a much more positive outlook on their marriage.
p374
aVCouples that don't let things go
p375
aVand couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow of course, it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold
p378
aVand not compromising to have a successful relationship.
p379
aVBut I think that it's quite interesting
p380
aVto know that there is really mathematical evidence
p381
aVto say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo those are my top three tips
p384
aVof how maths can help you with love and relationships.
p385
aVBut I hope, that aside from their use as tips,
p386
aVthey also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics.
p387
aVBecause for me, equations and symbols aren't just a thing.
p388
aVThey're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature
p389
aVand the startling simplicity
p390
aVin the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us,
p391
aVfrom how the world works to how we behave.
p392
aVSo I hope that perhaps, for just a couple of you,
p393
aVa little bit of insight into the mathematics of love
p394
aVcan persuade you to have a little bit more love for mathematics.
p395
aa(lp396
