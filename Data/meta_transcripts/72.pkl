VI'd like to speak about technology trends,
p4
aVwhich is something that many of you follow \u2014
p5
aVbut we also follow, for related reasons.
p6
aVObviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends
p7
aVare something that we write about and need to know about.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut also it's part of being any monthly magazine \u2014
p10
aVyou live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
p11
aVWe have to plan issues many months in advance;
p12
aVwe have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,
p13
aVnine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe also, like a lot of companies, create a product
p16
aVthat's based on technology trends.
p17
aVIn this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,
p18
aVsome entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
p19
aVAnd so we have to understand
p20
aVnot only why tech's important, where it's going,
p21
aVbut also, very importantly, when \u2014 the timing is everything.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made
p24
aVduring the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,
p25
aVor Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,
p26
aVthey were all right \u2014 they were just wrong in time.
p27
aVAlmost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
p28
aVBut the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations
p29
aVis obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
p30
aa(lp31
VYou've probably seen something like this before.
p32
aVThis is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about
p33
aVkind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
p34
aVAnd just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,
p35
aVto show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,
p36
aVor whether they were about to crash
p37
aVinto the trough of disillusionment,
p38
aVor rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
p39
aVAnd this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense
p40
aVof where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
p41
aa(lp42
VWe tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;
p43
aVwe'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
p44
aVWe want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,
p45
aVwe'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
p46
aVYou can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
p47
aVBut then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies
p48
aVare going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
p49
aVAnd then it's time to do it again. Last year.
p50
aVAnd that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
p51
aa(lp52
VI'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends
p53
aVthat I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"
p54
aVbut it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
p55
aVIt's based on the presumption, the observation even,
p56
aVthat all important technologies go through four stages in their life \u2014
p57
aVat least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
p58
aVAnd at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision \u2014
p59
aVa collision with something else \u2014
p60
aVfor example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology
p61
aVand also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
p62
aVAnd these are the inflection points that tell you
p63
aVwhat the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
p64
aVand maybe how you can do something about it.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe first is the critical price.
p67
aVThe first stage in a technology's advance
p68
aVis that it'll fall below a critical price.
p69
aVAfter it falls below a critical price, it will tend,
p70
aVif it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
p71
aVMany technologies, at that point, displace another technology,
p72
aVand that's another important point.
p73
aVAnd then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
p74
aVTowards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
p75
aa(lp76
VEach one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;
p77
aVit's an opportunity for the technology to change.
p78
aVAnd even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi \u2014
p79
aVyou know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,
p80
aVbut hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet \u2014
p81
aVthere's still more opportunity in that.
p82
aa(lp83
VI'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this
p84
aVby telling the story of the DVD,
p85
aVwhich is a technology which has done all of these.
p86
aVThe DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s
p87
aVand it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,
p88
aVit had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
p89
aVAnd it started to take off. And you can see that the units
p90
aVstarted to trend up, the hidden inflection point \u2014 it was taking off.
p91
aa(lp92
VThe next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,
p93
aV20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
p94
aVAnd what's interesting here
p95
aVis that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
p96
aVSuddenly you have a DVD in the house;
p97
aVyou've got high-quality digital video;
p98
aVyou have a reason to have a big-screen television;
p99
aVyou have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
p100
aVAnd maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,
p101
aVand bring the rest of your entertainment in.
p102
aVWhat's interesting also is \u2014 note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
p103
aVReed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,
p104
aVthat was an inflection point that he could do something with.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe next phase it hit was displacement.
p107
aVYou can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
p108
aVAnd here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
p109
aVNetflix was right \u2014 the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD
p110
aVin a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
p111
aVAmong the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;
p112
aVyou can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
p113
aVThat gave an advantage; that was an implication
p114
aVof the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
p117
aVThere's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,
p118
aVwho has, several times in the past year, been the number-one
p119
aVDVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
p120
aVYou're aware of the
p121
aVperhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede
p122
aVover the 30-dollar DVD.
p123
aVBut they're getting very, very cheap,
p124
aVand look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,
p125
aVthe premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,
p126
aVand the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
p127
aVThey're being commodified, and that's what happens
p128
aVwhen things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VNow they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,
p132
aVthese four stages of technology's life.
p133
aVI'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,
p134
aVjust technologies on our radar \u2014 and I'll use this lens,
p135
aVthese four, as a way to kind of tell you
p136
aVwhere each one of those technologies is in its development.
p137
aVThey're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there \u2014
p138
aVthey're just examples of technologies
p139
aVthat are in each one of these periods.
p140
aVBut I think that the implications of them approaching
p141
aVthese crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
p142
aa(lp143
VStart with gene sequencing.
p144
aVAs you probably know, gene sequencing \u2014 in a large part,
p145
aVbecause it's built on computers \u2014 is falling in price
p146
aVat a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
p147
aVIt is now possible \u2014 will be possible,
p148
aVand if Craig Venter indeed comes today,
p149
aVhe may tell you something about this \u2014
p150
aVto sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
p151
aVThat's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
p152
aVYou know, our ability to capture the tools of creation
p153
aVis getting closer and closer.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhat's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes
p156
aVthat we're discovering is rising very quickly.
p157
aVEach one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
p158
aVThere will come a day
p159
aVwhen you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,
p160
aVif you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
p161
aa(lp162
VHere's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
p163
aVThis is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect
p164
aVof generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
p165
aVIn January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
p166
aVThe generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,
p167
aVand the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
p168
aVToday it's less than 50 cents a day.
p169
aVAnd what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,
p170
aVif you look at the correlation between these two,
p171
aVas the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat
p172
aVgoes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO
p173
aVbelieve that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 \u2014
p174
aVtwo million in sub-Saharan Africa.
p175
aVAnd the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
p176
aa(lp177
VLinux is another good example.
p178
aVNow we've switched to critical mass.
p179
aVThese are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
p180
aVIf you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
p181
aVInterestingly, it's done a crossover before,
p182
aVbut not the crossovers that matter.
p183
aVThe crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
p184
aVBut you can look and see the direction those lines are going,
p185
aVyou can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
p186
aVIt's not just for the geeks any more.
p187
aVThat is, I imagine, what people in Redmond
p188
aVwake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnother technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
p192
aVI don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
p193
aVAnd if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 \u2014
p194
aVand I don't think this is a crazy forecast \u2014
p195
aVthey'll be two percent of auto sales.
p196
aVTwo percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,
p197
aVwhich is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
p198
aVAt two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd what's interesting about the hybrids taking off
p201
aVis you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
p202
aVIt's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
p203
aVAnd once you have electric motors, you can do anything:
p204
aVyou can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
p205
aVYou can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;
p206
aVyou can have replaceable body shapes \u2014
p207
aVit's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,
p208
aVbut it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
p209
aa(lp210
VVoice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
p211
aVAgain, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;
p212
aVit's a little hard to use right now.
p213
aVThere's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
p214
aVLook at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;
p215
aVthey already have nearly four million registered users \u2014
p216
aVthat's critical mass.
p217
aVAnd the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
p218
aVYou're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional
p219
aVtelecom standards. This is a tipping point \u2014
p220
aVif Malcolm's here, forgive me \u2014 and it's going to change the economics,
p221
aVand the speed, and the players in the industry.
p222
aVIt's going to look a little bit like that.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
p225
aVFree is something that comes with digital, because
p226
aVthe reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,
p227
aVbecause it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,
p228
aVbecause there's so much bandwidth.
p229
aVFree is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
p230
aVIt's an economic force; it's a technical force.
p231
aVIt's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
p232
aVIt is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
p233
aVFree is probably the most interesting thing.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd here you have just the number of songs
p236
aVthat can be stored on a hard drive.
p237
aVYou know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,
p238
aVbut it's basically, every song ever made could be stored
p239
aVon 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,
p240
aVthe physical element, of songs off the table.
p241
aVAnd you've seen the numbers.
p242
aVI mean, you know, the music industry is imploding
p243
aVin front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
p244
aVThey're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
p245
aVAnd their response is draconian, and not necessarily
p246
aVthe one that's going to get them out of this.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd finally, I'll give you one last example of free \u2014
p249
aVperhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics \u2014
p250
aVtheir abundance tends to make things free.
p251
aVThis is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
p252
aVAnd what's interesting is that it was just 1990
p253
aVwhen it was more than two dollars a minute.
p254
aVIndia had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
p255
aVIt was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,
p256
aVbut then there was just so much fiber out there,
p257
aVyou couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
p258
aVIt's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,
p261
aVto India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
p262
aVIt is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization
p263
aVand one of the most powerful economic tools
p264
aVthat we're seeing in our world today.
p265
aVThe force of India, and then China, and any other country
p266
aVthat can contact our markets
p267
aVand will work with our companies \u2014 because the communications are free \u2014
p268
aVis just beginning to be felt.
p269
aVAnd I think that's probably one
p270
aVof the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
p271
aVThank you.
