VFor years I've been feeling frustrated,
p4
aVbecause as a religious historian,
p5
aVI've become acutely aware
p6
aVof the centrality of compassion
p7
aVin all the major world faiths.
p8
aVEvery single one of them
p9
aVhas evolved their own version
p10
aVof what's been called the Golden Rule.
p11
aVSometimes it comes in a positive version \u2014
p12
aV"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
p13
aVAnd equally important
p14
aVis the negative version \u2014
p15
aV"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
p16
aVLook into your own heart,
p17
aVdiscover what it is that gives you pain
p18
aVand then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,
p19
aVto inflict that pain on anybody else.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd people have emphasized the importance of compassion,
p22
aVnot just because it sounds good,
p23
aVbut because it works.
p24
aVPeople have found that when they have
p25
aVimplemented the Golden Rule
p26
aVas Confucius said, "all day and every day,"
p27
aVnot just a question of doing your good deed for the day
p28
aVand then returning to a life of greed
p29
aVand egotism,
p30
aVbut to do it all day and every day,
p31
aVyou dethrone yourself from the center of your world,
p32
aVput another there, and you transcend yourself.
p33
aVAnd it brings you into the presence
p34
aVof what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
p35
aVSomething that goes beyond
p36
aVwhat we know in our ego-bound existence.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,
p39
aVthat this was so central to the religious life.
p40
aVBecause with a few wonderful exceptions,
p41
aVvery often when religious people come together,
p42
aVreligious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
p43
aVor uttering a council of hatred
p44
aVor inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
p45
aVOften people don't really want to be compassionate.
p46
aVI sometimes see
p47
aVwhen I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people
p48
aVa sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces
p49
aVbecause people often want to be right instead.
p50
aVAnd that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow why was I so grateful to TED?
p53
aVBecause they took me very gently
p54
aVfrom my book-lined study
p55
aVand brought me into the 21st century,
p56
aVenabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience
p57
aVthan I could have ever conceived.
p58
aVBecause I feel an urgency about this.
p59
aVIf we don't manage to implement
p60
aVthe Golden Rule globally,
p61
aVso that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,
p62
aVas though they were as important as ourselves,
p63
aVI doubt that we'll have
p64
aVa viable world to hand on to the next generation.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe task of our time,
p67
aVone of the great tasks of our time,
p68
aVis to build a global society, as I said,
p69
aVwhere people can live together in peace.
p70
aVAnd the religions that should be making a major contribution
p71
aVare instead seen as part of the problem.
p72
aVAnd of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
p73
aVThis is the source of all morality,
p74
aVthis imaginative act of empathy,
p75
aVputting yourself in the place of another.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd so we have a choice, it seems to me.
p78
aVWe can either go on bringing out or emphasizing
p79
aVthe dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,
p80
aVor we can go back to
p81
aVthe rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,
p82
aVwho, when asked by a pagan
p83
aVto sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,
p84
aVsaid, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
p85
aVThat is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that
p88
aVany interpretation of scripture
p89
aVthat bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
p90
aVAnd we need to revive that spirit.
p91
aVAnd it's not just going to happen
p92
aVbecause a spirit of love wafts us down.
p93
aVWe have to make this happen,
p94
aVand we can do it
p95
aVwith the modern communications
p96
aVthat TED has introduced.
p97
aVAlready I've been tremendously heartened
p98
aVat the response of all our partners.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn Singapore, we have a group
p101
aVgoing to use the Charter to heal divisions
p102
aVrecently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,
p103
aVand some members of the parliament want
p104
aVto implement it politically.
p105
aVIn Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition
p106
aVin which leading artists are going to be
p107
aVtaking people, young people,
p108
aVand showing them that compassion also lies
p109
aVat the root of all art.
p110
aVThroughout Europe, the Muslim communities
p111
aVare holding events and discussions,
p112
aVare discussing the centrality of compassion
p113
aVin Islam and in all faiths.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
p116
aVReligious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,
p117
aVconcentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
p118
aVReligious teaching must always lead to action.
p119
aVAnd I intend to work on this till my dying day.
p120
aVAnd I want to continue with our partners
p121
aVto do two things \u2014
p122
aVeducate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
p123
aVEducation because we've so
p124
aVdropped out of compassion.
p125
aVPeople often think it simply means
p126
aVfeeling sorry for somebody.
p127
aVBut of course you don't understand compassion
p128
aVif you're just going to think about it.
p129
aVYou also have to do it.
p130
aa(lp131
VI want them to get the media involved
p132
aVbecause the media are crucial
p133
aVin helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views
p134
aVwe have of other people,
p135
aVwhich are dividing us from one another.
p136
aVThe same applies to educators.
p137
aVI'd like youth to get a sense of
p138
aVthe dynamism, the dynamic and challenge
p139
aVof a compassionate lifestyle.
p140
aVAnd also see that it demands acute intelligence,
p141
aVnot just a gooey feeling.
p142
aa(lp143
VI'd like to call upon scholars to explore
p144
aVthe compassionate theme
p145
aVin their own and in other people's traditions.
p146
aVAnd perhaps above all,
p147
aVto encourage a sensitivity about
p148
aVuncompassionate speaking,
p149
aVso that because people have this Charter,
p150
aVwhatever their beliefs or lack of them,
p151
aVthey feel empowered
p152
aVto challenge uncompassionate speech,
p153
aVdisdainful remarks
p154
aVfrom their religious leaders, their political leaders,
p155
aVfrom the captains of industry.
p156
aVBecause we can change the world,
p157
aVwe have the ability.
p158
aa(lp159
VI would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
p160
aVI was still stuck in the old world
p161
aVof a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room
p162
aVand issuing yet another arcane statement.
p163
aVAnd TED introduced me to a whole new way
p164
aVof thinking and presenting ideas.
p165
aVBecause that is what is so wonderful about TED.
p166
aVIn this room, all this expertise,
p167
aVif we joined it all together,
p168
aVwe could change the world.
p169
aVAnd of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut I'd just like to quote, finish at the end
p172
aVwith a reference to a British author, an Oxford author
p173
aVwhom I don't quote very often,
p174
aVC.S. Lewis.
p175
aVBut he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind
p176
aVever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
p177
aVIt's in his book "The Four Loves."
p178
aVHe said that he distinguished between erotic love,
p179
aVwhen two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
p180
aVAnd then he compared that to friendship,
p181
aVwhen two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,
p182
aVwith their eyes fixed on a common goal.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe don't have to fall in love with each other,
p185
aVbut we can become friends.
p186
aVAnd I am convinced.
p187
aVI felt it very strongly
p188
aVduring our little deliberations at Vevey,
p189
aVthat when people of all different persuasions
p190
aVcome together, working side by side
p191
aVfor a common goal,
p192
aVdifferences melt away.
p193
aVAnd we learn amity.
p194
aVAnd we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
p195
aVThank you very much.
