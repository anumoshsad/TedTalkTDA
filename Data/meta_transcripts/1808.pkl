VAdam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much
p4
aVof me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,
p5
aVbut I thought it would just be nice to recap
p6
aVon how Derek got to where he is today.
p7
aa(lp8
VIt's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,
p9
aVbut when Derek was born,
p10
aVhe could have fitted on the palm of your hand.
p11
aVHe was born three and a half months premature,
p12
aVand really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.
p13
aVHe had to have a lot of oxygen,
p14
aVand that affected your eyes, Derek,
p15
aVand also the way you understand language
p16
aVand the way you understand the world.
p17
aVBut that was the end of the bad news,
p18
aVbecause when Derek came home from the hospital,
p19
aVhis family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny
p20
aVwho was going to look after you, Derek,
p21
aVreally for the rest of your childhood.
p22
aVAnd Nanny's great insight, really,
p23
aVwas to think, here's a child who can't see.
p24
aVMusic must be the thing for Derek.
p25
aVAnd sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,
p26
aVto him for his first few years of life.
p27
aVAnd I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice
p28
aVhour after hour every day that made him think
p29
aVmaybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,
p30
aVsome sort of musical gift.
p31
aVHere's a little picture of Derek going up now,
p32
aVwhen you were with your nanny.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow Nanny's great other insight was to think,
p35
aVperhaps we should get Derek something to play,
p36
aVand sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard
p37
aVout of the loft, never thinking really
p38
aVthat anything much would come of it.
p39
aVBut Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing
p40
aVand actually bashed it,
p41
aVbashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
p42
aVBut out of all the bashing, after a few months,
p43
aVemerged the most fantastic music,
p44
aVand I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,
p45
aVwhen you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world
p46
aVout there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.
p47
aVThat was the great eureka moment.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, not being able to see meant, of course,
p50
aVthat you taught yourself.
p51
aa(lp52
VDerek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.
p53
aa(lp54
VAO: You did teach yourself to play,
p55
aVand as a consequence,
p56
aVplaying the piano for you, Derek,
p57
aVwas a lot of knuckles and karate chops,
p58
aVand even a bit of nose going on in there.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd now, here's what Nanny did also do
p61
aVwas to press the record button on one of those little
p62
aVearly tape recorders that they had,
p63
aVand this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing
p64
aVwhen you were four years old.
p65
aa(lp66
VDP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."
p67
aa(lp68
VAO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."
p69
aVThis one is "English Country Garden."
p70
aa(lp71
VDP: "English Country Garden."
p72
aa(lp73
V(Music: "English Country Garden")
p74
aa(lp75
VAO: There you are.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VI think that's just fantastic.
p80
aVYou know, there's this little child who can't see,
p81
aVcan't really understand much about the world,
p82
aVhas no one in the family who plays an instrument,
p83
aVand yet he taught himself to play that.
p84
aVAnd as you can see from the picture,
p85
aVthere was quite a lot of body action going on
p86
aVwhile you were playing, Derek.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, along \u2014 Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,
p89
aVand at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,
p90
aVbecause when you played the piano,
p91
aVyou seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,
p92
aVand also you had this little habit
p93
aVof hitting me out of the way.
p94
aVSo as soon as I tried to get near the piano,
p95
aVI was firmly shoved off.
p96
aVAnd having said to your dad, Nic,
p97
aVthat I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused
p98
aVas to how I might go about that
p99
aVif I wasn't allowed near the piano.
p100
aVBut after a while, I thought, well, the only way
p101
aVis to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,
p102
aVand in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,
p103
aVI could just play something very quickly
p104
aVfor him to learn.
p105
aVAnd in the end, Derek, I think you agreed
p106
aVthat we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.
p107
aVAs you can see, there's me in my early,
p108
aVpre-marriage days with a brown beard,
p109
aVand little Derek concentrating there.
p110
aa(lp111
VI just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VNow then, by the age of 10, Derek really
p116
aVhad taken the world by storm.
p117
aVThis is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican
p118
aVwith the Royal Philharmonic Pops.
p119
aVBasically it was just an exciting journey, really.
p120
aVAnd in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,
p121
aVand so there was always a moment of tension
p122
aVas to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play
p123
aVand whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,
p124
aVand all that kind of thing.
p125
aVBut the orchestra were wowed as well,
p126
aVand the press of the world were fascinated by your ability
p127
aVto play these fantastic pieces.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow the question is, how do you do it, Derek?
p130
aVAnd hopefully we can show the audience now
p131
aVhow it is you do what you do.
p132
aa(lp133
VI think that one of the first things that happened
p134
aVwhen you were very little, Derek,
p135
aVwas that by the time you were two,
p136
aVyour musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.
p137
aVAnd so whenever you heard any note at all \u2014
p138
aVif I just play a random note \u2014
p139
aV(Piano notes) \u2014
p140
aVyou knew instantly what it was,
p141
aVand you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.
p142
aVNow that's called perfect pitch,
p143
aVand some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes
p144
aVin the middle of the piano.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Piano notes)
p147
aa(lp148
VYou can see how \u2014 you get a sense of playing with Derek.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VBut Derek, your ear is so much more than that.
p153
aVIf I just put the microphone down for a bit,
p154
aVI'm going to play a cluster of notes.
p155
aVThose of you who can see will know how many notes,
p156
aVbut Derek, of course, can't.
p157
aVNot only can you say how many notes,
p158
aVit's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Chords)
p161
aa(lp162
VWell, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.
p163
aVAnd it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,
p164
aVnot only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,
p165
aVDerek, you can hear every note,
p166
aVand instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,
p167
aVreproduce those on the keyboard,
p168
aVthat makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow then.
p171
aVIt's no use having that kind of raw ability
p172
aVwithout the technique,
p173
aVand luckily, Derek, you decided that,
p174
aVonce we did start learning, you'd let me help you
p175
aVlearn all the scale fingerings.
p176
aVSo for example using your thumb under with C major.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Piano notes)
p179
aa(lp180
VEtc.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd in the end, you got so quick,
p183
aVthat things like "Flight of the Bumblebee"
p184
aVwere no problem, were they?
p185
aa(lp186
VDP: No.
p187
aa(lp188
VAO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,
p189
aVDerek was playing things like this.
p190
aa(lp191
VDP: This.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
p194
aV(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VAO: Derek, let's have a bow.
p197
aa(lp198
VWell done.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,
p201
aVyou could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"
p202
aVin the usual key, but any note I play,
p203
aVDerek can play it on.
p204
aVSo if I just choose a note at random, like that one.
p205
aV(Piano notes)
p206
aVCan you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?
p207
aa(lp208
VDP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
p211
aa(lp212
VAO: Or another one? How about in G minor?
p213
aa(lp214
VDP: G minor.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
p217
aa(lp218
VAO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer
p221
aVthat can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,
p222
aVall the pieces in the world that are out there.
p223
aVMost pianists would have a heart attack if you said,
p224
aV"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'
p225
aVin B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.
p226
aVIn fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,
p227
aVyou'd learned the version that you'd learned,
p228
aVand then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,
p229
aVso while we were waiting in the two hours
p230
aVbefore the rehearsal and the concert,
p231
aVDerek listened to the different version and learned it quickly
p232
aVand then was able to play it with the orchestra.
p233
aVFantastic chap.
p234
aa(lp235
VThe other wonderful thing about you is memory.
p236
aa(lp237
VDP: Memory. AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,
p238
aVwe ask the audience to participate, of course,
p239
aVby suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.
p240
aVAnd people say, "Well, that's terribly brave
p241
aVbecause what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"
p242
aVAnd I say, "No, it's not brave at all,
p243
aVbecause if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,
p244
aVyou're invited to come and sing it first,
p245
aVand then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VSo just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?
p250
aa(lp251
VDP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.
p252
aVWould you like to hear me play?
p253
aa(lp254
V(Audience: "Theme of Paganini.")
p255
aa(lp256
VAO: Paganini. DP: "The Theme of Paganini."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V(Music: "Theme of Paganini")
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VAO: Well done.
p265
aa(lp266
VDerek's going to L.A. soon,
p267
aVand it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I
p268
aVwill have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,
p269
aVwhich is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?
p270
aa(lp271
VDP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.
p272
aa(lp273
VAO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,
p274
aVbut Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VBut in America, they've coined this term,
p279
aV"the human iPod" for Derek,
p280
aVwhich I think is just missing the point, really,
p281
aVbecause Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.
p282
aVYou're a fantastic, creative musician,
p283
aVand I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,
p284
aVthan when we went to Slovenia,
p285
aVand someone \u2014 in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,
p286
aVand this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.
p287
aa(lp288
VDP: He played "Chopsticks." AO: And played "Chopsticks."
p289
aa(lp290
VDP: "Chopsticks."
p291
aa(lp292
VAO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Piano notes)
p295
aa(lp296
VAO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.
p297
aVHe's sitting there.
p298
aa(lp299
VDP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Music: "Chopsticks")
p302
aa(lp303
VDP: Let Derek play it.
p304
aa(lp305
VAO: What did you do with it, Derek?
p306
aa(lp307
VDP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.
p308
aa(lp309
VAO: This is Derek the musician.
p310
aV(Music: "Chopsticks" improvisation)
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
V(Music) (Clapping)
p315
aa(lp316
VKeep up with Derek.

V(Music)
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VThe TED people will kill me,
p323
aVbut perhaps there's time for one encore.
p324
aa(lp325
VDP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo this is one of Derek's heroes.
p328
aVIt's the great Art Tatum \u2014 DP: Art Tatum.
p329
aa(lp330
VAO: \u2014 who also was a pianist who couldn't see,
p331
aVand also, I think, like Derek,
p332
aVthought that all the world was a piano,
p333
aVso whenever Art Tatum plays something,
p334
aVit sounds like there's three pianos in the room.
p335
aVAnd here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."
p336
aa(lp337
VDP: "Tiger Rag."
