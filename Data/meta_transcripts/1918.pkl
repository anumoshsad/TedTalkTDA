VI want you to imagine
p4
aVwhat a breakthrough this was
p5
aVfor women who were victims of violence
p6
aVin the 1980s.
p7
aVThey would come into the emergency room
p8
aVwith what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,"
p9
aVand I would see a woman who was beaten,
p10
aVI would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist
p11
aVand swollen eyes.
p12
aVAnd as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,
p13
aVwe would take her picture,
p14
aVwe would wait 90 seconds,
p15
aVand we would give her the photograph.
p16
aVAnd she would then have
p17
aVthe evidence she needed to go to court.
p18
aVWe were making what was invisible visible.
p19
aa(lp20
VI've been doing this for 30 years.
p21
aVI've been part of a social movement
p22
aVthat has been working on ending
p23
aVviolence against women and children.
p24
aVAnd for all those years,
p25
aVI've had an absolutely passionate
p26
aVand sometimes not popular belief
p27
aVthat this violence is not inevitable,
p28
aVthat it is learned, and if it's learned,
p29
aVit can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VWhy do I believe this?
p33
aVBecause it's true.
p34
aVIt is absolutely true.
p35
aVBetween 1993 and 2010,
p36
aVdomestic violence among adult women
p37
aVin the United States
p38
aVhas gone down by 64 percent,
p39
aVand that is great news.
p40
aV(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VSixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?
p43
aVOur eyes were wide open.
p44
aVThirty years ago, women were beaten,
p45
aVthey were stalked, they were raped,
p46
aVand no one talked about it.
p47
aVThere was no justice.
p48
aVAnd as an activist, that was not good enough.
p49
aVAnd so step one on this journey
p50
aVis we organized,
p51
aVand we created this extraordinary
p52
aVunderground network of amazing women
p53
aVwho opened shelters,
p54
aVand if they didn't open a shelter,
p55
aVthey opened their home
p56
aVso that women and children could be safe.
p57
aVAnd you know what else we did?
p58
aVWe had bake sales, we had car washes,
p59
aVand we did everything we could do to fundraise,
p60
aVand then at one point we said,
p61
aVyou know, it's time that we went
p62
aVto the federal government
p63
aVand asked them to pay for these
p64
aVextraordinary services that are saving people's lives.
p65
aVRight? (Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd so, step number two,
p68
aVwe knew we needed to change the laws.
p69
aVAnd so we went to Washington,
p70
aVand we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.
p71
aVAnd I remember walking through the halls
p72
aVof the U.S. Capitol,
p73
aVand I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,
p74
aVand I couldn't imagine
p75
aVthat anybody would ever challenge
p76
aVthis important piece of legislation.
p77
aVI was probably 30 and naive.
p78
aVBut I heard about a congressman
p79
aVwho had a very, very different point of view.
p80
aVDo you know what he called
p81
aVthis important piece of legislation?
p82
aVHe called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
p83
aVThe Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
p84
aVLadies and gentlemen, that was in 1984
p85
aVin the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VTen years later, after lots of hard work,
p89
aVwe finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,
p90
aVwhich is a life-changing act
p91
aVthat has saved so many lives. (Applause)
p92
aVThank you.
p93
aVI was proud to be part of that work,
p94
aVand it changed the laws
p95
aVand it put millions of dollars into local communities.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd you know what else it did? It collected data.
p98
aVAnd I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.
p99
aVIn fact, I am a data nerd.
p100
aVI'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
p101
aVI am a data nerd,
p102
aVand the reason for that is I want to make sure
p103
aVthat if we spend a dollar, that the program works,
p104
aVand if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd I also want to say one other thing:
p107
aVWe are not going to solve this problem
p108
aVby building more jails
p109
aVor by even building more shelters.
p110
aVIt is about economic empowerment for women,
p111
aVit is about healing kids who are hurt,
p112
aVand it is about prevention with a capital P.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so, step number three on this journey:
p115
aVWe know, if we're going to keep making this progress,
p116
aVwe're going to have to turn up the volume,
p117
aVwe're going to have to increase the visibility,
p118
aVand we're going to have to engage the public.
p119
aVAnd so knowing that, we went to the Advertising Council,
p120
aVand we asked them to help us
p121
aVbuild a public education campaign.
p122
aVAnd we looked around the world to Canada
p123
aVand Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,
p124
aVand we took this knowledge
p125
aVand we built the first national
p126
aVpublic education campaign
p127
aVcalled There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.
p128
aVTake a look at one of our spots.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Video) Man: Where's dinner?
p131
aa(lp132
VWoman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so\u2014
p133
aa(lp134
VMan: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known\u2014
p135
aa(lp136
VMan: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud.
p137
aVPlease don't\u2014Let go of me!
p138
aa(lp139
VMan: Get in the kitchen! Woman: No! Help!
p140
aa(lp141
VMan: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)
p142
aa(lp143
VThat's what hurts! That's what hurts! (Breaking glass)
p144
aa(lp145
VWoman: Help me!
p146
aa(lp147
V["Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse?"]
p148
aa(lp149
VEsta Soler: As we were in the process
p150
aVof releasing this campaign,
p151
aVO.J. Simpson was arrested
p152
aVfor the murder of his wife and her friend.
p153
aVWe learned that he had a long history
p154
aVof domestic violence.
p155
aVThe media became fixated.
p156
aVThe story of domestic violence
p157
aVwent from the back page,
p158
aVbut actually from the no-page, to the front page.
p159
aVOur ads blanketed the airwaves,
p160
aVand women, for the first time,
p161
aVstarted to tell their stories.
p162
aVMovements are about moments,
p163
aVand we seized this moment.
p164
aVAnd let me just put this in context.
p165
aVBefore 1980, do you have any idea
p166
aVhow many articles were in The New York Times
p167
aVon domestic violence?
p168
aVI'll tell you: 158.
p169
aVAnd in the 2000s, over 7,000.
p170
aVWe were obviously making a difference.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut we were still missing a critical element.
p173
aVSo, step four: We needed to engage men.
p174
aVWe couldn't solve this problem
p175
aVwith 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.
p176
aVAnd I already told you I'm a data nerd.
p177
aVNational polling told us that men felt indicted
p178
aVand not invited into this conversation.
p179
aVSo we wondered, how can we include men?
p180
aVHow can we get men to talk about
p181
aVviolence against women and girls?
p182
aVAnd a male friend of mine pulled me aside
p183
aVand he said, "You want men to talk about violence
p184
aVagainst women and girls. Men don't talk."
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVI apologize to the men in the audience.
p187
aVI know you do.
p188
aVBut he said, "Do you know what they do do?
p189
aVThey do talk to their kids.
p190
aVThey talk to their kids as parents, as coaches."
p191
aVAnd that's what we did.
p192
aVWe met men where they were at
p193
aVand we built a program.
p194
aVAnd then we had this one event
p195
aVthat stays in my heart forever
p196
aVwhere a basketball coach
p197
aVwas talking to a room filled with male athletes
p198
aVand men from all walks of life.
p199
aVAnd he was talking about the importance
p200
aVof coaching boys into men
p201
aVand changing the culture of the locker room
p202
aVand giving men the tools to have healthy relationships.
p203
aVAnd all of a sudden, he looked at the back of the room,
p204
aVand he saw his daughter,
p205
aVand he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,
p206
aVand he said, "Michaela, come up here."
p207
aVAnd she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,
p208
aVand she got up there,
p209
aVand he said, "Sit down next to me."
p210
aVShe sat right down next to him.
p211
aVHe gave her this big hug, and he said,
p212
aV"People ask me why I do this work.
p213
aVI do this work because I'm her dad,
p214
aVand I don't want anyone ever to hurt her."
p215
aVAnd as a parent, I get it.
p216
aVI get it,
p217
aVknowing that there are so many sexual assaults
p218
aVon college campuses
p219
aVthat are so widespread and so under-reported.
p220
aVWe've done a lot for adult women.
p221
aVWe've got to do a better job for our kids.
p222
aVWe just do. We have to. (Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VWe've come a long way
p225
aVsince the days of the Polaroid.
p226
aVTechnology has been our friend.
p227
aVThe mobile phone is a global game changer
p228
aVfor the empowerment of women,
p229
aVand Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube
p230
aVand all the social media helps us organize
p231
aVand tell our story in a powerful way.
p232
aVAnd so those of you in this audience
p233
aVwho have helped build those applications
p234
aVand those platforms, as an organizer,
p235
aVI say, thank you very much.
p236
aVReally. I clap for you.
p237
aV(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VI'm the daughter of a man
p240
aVwho joined one club in his life,
p241
aVthe Optimist Club.
p242
aVYou can't make that one up.
p243
aVAnd it is his spirit and his optimism
p244
aVthat is in my DNA.
p245
aVI have been doing this work
p246
aVfor over 30 years,
p247
aVand I am convinced, now more than ever,
p248
aVin the capacity of human beings to change.
p249
aVI believe we can bend the arc of human history
p250
aVtoward compassion and equality,
p251
aVand I also fundamentally believe
p252
aVand passionately believe
p253
aVthat this violence does not have to be part
p254
aVof the human condition.
p255
aVAnd I ask you, stand with us
p256
aVas we create futures without violence
p257
aVfor women and girls and men and boys everywhere.
p258
