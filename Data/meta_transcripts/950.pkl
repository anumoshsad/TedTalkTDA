VThe moment I say "school,"
p4
aVso many memories come back to me.
p5
aVIt's like after every exam, when I walk out,
p6
aVthe teacher would say, "Hey, come.
p7
aVHow did you do?"
p8
aVI would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
p9
aVAnd I didn't understand why,
p10
aVin one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"
p11
aVin the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
p12
aVSo it went on like that,
p13
aVand I didn't know where else to find myself.
p14
aVSo I remember those nights
p15
aVI used to go to sleep
p16
aVwith asking help from [the] Unknown
p17
aVbecause, for some reason,
p18
aVI couldn't believe what my father and mother
p19
aVhanged in the Puja room as a god,
p20
aVbecause my friend's family
p21
aVhad something else as a god.
p22
aVSo I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown
p23
aVand ask help,"
p24
aVand started getting help from everywhere,
p25
aVeach and every corner of my life at that time.
p26
aVMy brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
p27
aa(lp28
VThen, when I was in eighth standard
p29
aVaround 13 years old,
p30
aVI started working in a part-time job
p31
aVin one of the signboard artists called Putu.
p32
aVAnd then school also started supporting me.
p33
aV"Oh, he's bad at studies,
p34
aVbut let him send to the drawing competitions."
p35
aVSo it was good to survive with that little tool
p36
aVthat I found to find my own place in school.
p37
aVAnd one of those competitions,
p38
aVI just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
p39
aVAnd I didn't have the patience to wait
p40
aVuntil I reached home.
p41
aVSo I just switched on in the train, loudly.
p42
aVIf you travel in Indian trains,
p43
aVyou can see people listening to radio
p44
aVand, you know, even from their mobiles.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo at that time \u2014 and I was 13 \u2014
p47
aVand I was listening to just radio,
p48
aVand someone happened to sit next to me,
p49
aVlike these three people are sitting here.
p50
aVYou know, like just adjacent to me.
p51
aVHe just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
p52
aVI said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
p53
aVAnd he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
p54
aVI think
p55
aVyou should study in a school of art.
p56
aVYou just quit school and come there."
p57
aVSo, why I'm telling you this,
p58
aVyou know, maybe, you know,
p59
aVwhoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life \u2014 it's possible.
p60
aVIt is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
p61
aVSo that's what made me enter
p62
aV[the] college of arts after three attempts
p63
aVand just continue to inquire
p64
aVwhat I really want to do with art work, or art
p65
aVand finally I'm here in front of you.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen I look back, you know,
p68
aVon what happened between that time
p69
aVand now here \u2014
p70
aVthe last 10/15 years \u2014
p71
aVI can see that most of the works
p72
aVrevolve around three subjects,
p73
aVbut it was not intentional.
p74
aVAnd I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,
p75
aV"What really makes us?" \u2014 you know,
p76
aVit's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
p77
aVSo I was thinking,
p78
aVbut when you look at the past,
p79
aVthe way to understand the past
p80
aVis only by the traces available,
p81
aVbecause we cannot go back [to] the past.
p82
aVIt can be ruins, or it can be music,
p83
aVor it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
p84
aVBut it is just a kind of trace of that time.
p85
aVAnd that fascinated me,
p86
aVto explore that territory.
p87
aVSo I was working on the line,
p88
aVbut instead of working about traces,
p89
aVI started capturing traces.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo here are some of the works I would like to show you.
p92
aVSo this is called "Self In Progress."
p93
aVIt's just a trace of being in this body.
p94
aVSo here, what happened then,
p95
aVyou know \u2014 what I really enjoyed the most
p96
aVis that this sculpture
p97
aVis nothing but a trace of myself.
p98
aVIt's almost like a 3D photograph.
p99
aVSo there is an element of performance,
p100
aVand there is an element of sculpture,
p101
aVand there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
p102
aVSo it's almost like fossils for the future.
p103
aVAnd then moved slowly
p104
aVto explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
p105
aVSo this is what I was talking about, while molding,
p106
aVit's such a great experience,
p107
aVbecause we have freedom of like walking,
p108
aVor moving my hand or, moving around in the space,
p109
aVbut the moment this becomes solid,
p110
aVwhen you cannot move even an inch,
p111
aVbecause this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid;
p112
aVbut after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint
p115
aVbecause, knowingly or unknowingly,
p116
aVwhatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
p117
aVSo I just thought, "I'm going to capture
p118
aVthumbprint, footprint,
p119
aVor whatever traces we leave as humans."
p120
aVThis is the trace of fire,
p121
aVthis is the trace of sun.
p122
aVBecause when I was capturing traces, you know,
p123
aVthis thought comes to me always:
p124
aVis it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,
p125
aVor is there other ways to capture it?"
p126
aVSo this work is nothing but like \u2014
p127
aVbecause of the focal length of the lens,
p128
aVit just shows what is on the other side.
p129
aVSo I just put the paper on the focal length,
p130
aVwhich was an etching print,
p131
aVthen I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
p132
aVThis is called "Dawn to Dawn."
p133
aVWhat I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper
p134
aVthen put a coconut rope,
p135
aVand just burnt it.
p136
aVSo it took about 24 hours to get this line.
p137
aVSo wherever the fire is eating the paper,
p138
aVthat's what becomes the work \u2014
p139
aVdetail.
p140
aa(lp141
VEven though we have traces
p142
aVwhen we try to understand them,
p143
aVthe perception and context
p144
aVplay a major role to understand it.
p145
aVSo do we really understand what it is,
p146
aVor are we trying to get
p147
aVwhat we think it is?
p148
aVThen move towards questioning the perception
p149
aVbecause, even though there are traces,
p150
aVwhen you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
p151
aVSo like let's say even a simple act.
p152
aVHow many of you saw a cow crossing in India
p153
aVwhile you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
p154
aVCan you just raise the hand?
p155
aa(lp156
VIf you just ask an opinion
p157
aVof how, everyone can interpret it.
p158
aVLike, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,
p159
aVshe'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
p160
aVWhy the cow was crossing the road, you know.
p161
aVThe answer can be so different if Potter said it.
p162
aVHe would say, "For the greater good."
p163
aVMartin Luther King would say,
p164
aV"I imagine a world where all cows will be free
p165
aVto cross the road,
p166
aVwithout having their motives called into question."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVImagine Moses comes now, and he sees
p169
aVthe same cow walking around the street.
p170
aVHe would definitely say,
p171
aV"God came down from heaven,
p172
aVand he said unto the cow,
p173
aV'Thou shalt cross the road.'
p174
aVAnd cow crossed the road,
p175
aVand there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVFreud would say,
p178
aV"The fact that you're at all concerned
p179
aVreveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVIf we ask Einstein,
p182
aVhe would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,
p183
aVor the road moved underneath the cow,
p184
aVdepends on your frame of reference."
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVOr Buddha \u2014
p187
aVif he saw the same cow, he would say,
p188
aV"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, what we see
p193
aVis just what we think often,
p194
aVand most of the time, we don't see what it is.
p195
aVIt just all depends on one's perception.
p196
aVAnd context, what is really context?
p197
aVYou know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
p198
aVBecause I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
p199
aVThe meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
p200
aVIt's just created by the mind.
p201
aVIf you look at this piece of paper,
p202
aVthis is the breadth
p203
aVand this is called length.
p204
aVThis is how we've been taught in school.
p205
aVBut if you tear it in the middle \u2014
p206
aVnow, I didn't touch this breadth,
p207
aVbut still, the meaning of this changes.
p208
aVSo what we conceive as a meaning
p209
aVis always not there;
p210
aVit's on the other side,
p211
aVeven when we say dark, light,
p212
aVgood, bad, tall, short \u2014
p213
aVall meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
p214
aVIt's just that being a human,
p215
aVthe way we train to perceive the reality
p216
aVcreates this meaning.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo this work from this period
p219
aVis mostly like \u2014
p220
aVyou know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
p221
aVIt's just captured through from the lamp.
p222
aVSo the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
p223
aVSo this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
p224
aVThis is called "Limit Out."
p225
aVThis shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch \u2014
p226
aVdo we really see?
p227
aVThis is an exact negative.
p228
aVIt's about six inches deep in the wall,
p229
aVbut it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
p230
aVYou know the wall is almost like \u2014
p231
aVthis is the first skin, and this is the second,
p232
aVand there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
p233
aVAnd we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
p234
aVAgain, "Inward Out."
p235
aVIt's a full-figure cast from myself.
p236
aVIt's about eight inches deep.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhen I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators \u2014
p239
aVand now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception \u2014
p240
aVwhenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
p241
aVit just makes me feel like:
p242
aVis there anything behind, are there any traces up there,
p243
aVwhich as a human, we don't see them?
p244
aVIs there any way to capture the thought
p245
aVinto visual art?
p246
aVI couldn't find it.
p247
aVBut a solution arrived
p248
aVafter being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,
p249
aVin the restroom,
p250
aVwhen I was changing the air freshener
p251
aVthat goes from solid substance to vapor.
p252
aVIt's called Odonil.
p253
aVThis is the work I made out of that material.
p254
aVThe process to get to make the sculpture was interesting,
p255
aVbecause I wrote to Balsara,
p256
aVwho produces that air freshener called Odonil,
p257
aVsaying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
p258
aVWill you help me to make this sculpture?"
p259
aVThey never wrote back to me.
p260
aVThen I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries
p261
aVFacilitating Unit and ask help."
p262
aVSo I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
p263
aVThey said, "Of course.
p264
aVThis is the fee for the project report,
p265
aVand we will give you all the details," and they gave.
p266
aVFinally, I went back to them and said,
p267
aV"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
p268
aVPlease come for the show."
p269
aVAnd they did.
p270
aVAnd this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
p271
aa(lp272
VIn India, nobody really talks about works of art;
p273
aVthey always talk about the appreciation of art.
p274
aVYou buy this for 3,000 rupees,
p275
aVit'll become 30,000 in two months.
p276
aVThis is the craft that was going on,
p277
aVbut there are a few collectors
p278
aVwho also collect art which can depreciate.
p279
aVAnd this was collected by Anupam \u2014
p280
aVwhich is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything,
p281
aVbecause it will evaporate.
p282
aVSo this is after a few weeks,
p283
aVthis is after a few months.
p284
aVIt's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
p285
aVSo if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"
p286
aVit may not be the portrait after a few months.
p287
aVAnd if they say it's solid,
p288
aVit will not be solid, it will evaporate.
p289
aVAnd if they say they don't get it,
p290
aVthat's also not true,
p291
aVbecause it's in the air.
p292
aVIt's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
p293
aVSo they inhaled it,
p294
aVbut they are not aware of it.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhile I was doing that work,
p297
aVmy mom and my dad,
p298
aVthey were looking at it and they said,
p299
aV"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
p300
aVAnd I was like, "What do you mean?"
p301
aV"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
p302
aVDon't you think it remained something about death," they said.
p303
aV"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,
p304
aV"this is tucked in some small solid,
p305
aVbut the moment it evaporates,
p306
aVit's merged with the whole."
p307
aVBut she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
p308
aVCan you make something from nothing
p309
aVas a sculptor?"
p310
aVI said, "No, mom. It can't be.
p311
aVBecause we can create
p312
aVa sculpture
p313
aVby gathering dust together,
p314
aVor we can break the sculpture and get the dust,
p315
aVbut there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
p316
aa(lp317
VSo, I did this work for her.
p318
aVIt's called "Emerging Angel."
p319
aVThis is the first day \u2014
p320
aVit just gives the appearance
p321
aVthat one is becoming the other.
p322
aVSo, the same sculpture
p323
aVafter a few days.
p324
aVThis is after 15/20 days.
p325
aVThrough that small little slit
p326
aVbetween the glass box and the wood,
p327
aVthe air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
p328
aVThis gave me a greater faith.
p329
aVThat evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith
p330
aVthat maybe there is many more possibilities
p331
aVto capture [the] invisible.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo what you see now
p334
aVis called "Shadow Foreshadow."
p335
aVAnd what I'd like to tell you
p336
aVis we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
p337
aVwe see the source of the light.
p338
aVWe see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
p339
aVYou know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark,
p340
aVbut it's filled with light all the time.
p341
aVWhen it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
p342
aVThe same thing in the darkroom.
p343
aVThe little dust particle will again, reflect the light,
p344
aVand we realize the existence of light.
p345
aVSo we don't see dark, we don't see light,
p346
aVwe don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
p347
aVSo, I just started doing this work
p348
aVto inquire further
p349
aVabout how to sculpt
p350
aVthe space between this object and there.
p351
aVBecause, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that \u2014
p352
aVbut how to sculpt this, you know?
p353
aVIf we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
p354
aVThe skin of this is also representing this.
p355
aVAnd skin at the other end also represents the floor.
p356
aVI did this as an experiment
p357
aVof casting the shadow.
p358
aVSo this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
p359
aVThen the second one \u2014
p360
aVthe moment you bring any invisible into the visible world
p361
aVit will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
p362
aVSo that produced a shadow.
p363
aVThen I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
p364
aVThen, again, that becomes an object.
p365
aVAgain, throwing light, then the third one.
p366
aVSo what you see is nothing but shadow
p367
aVof a shadow of a shadow.
p368
aVAnd then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
p369
aVI thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
p370
aVYou can see the detail.
p371
aa(lp372
VThis is called "Gravity."
p373
aVIt's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
p374
aVIt's a false wall, which contains
p375
aVlike 110 cubic feet.
p376
aVSo that hole actually
p377
aVmakes the air come out and go in.
p378
aVSo where it's happening, we can see,
p379
aVbut what is happening will remain invisible only.
p380
aVThis is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
p381
aVThis is called "Kaayam."
p382
aVDetail.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd what I'd like to tell you,
p385
aVour senses are so limited \u2014
p386
aVwe cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
p387
aVWe don't feel, "I am touching the air,"
p388
aVbut if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
p389
aVSo all of our construction of reality
p390
aVis through these limited senses.
p391
aVSo my request was like,
p392
aVis there any way to use all this
p393
aVas just a symbol or a sign?
p394
aVAnd to really get to the point,
p395
aVwe should move beyond, you know,
p396
aVgo to the other side of the wall, like illogic,
p397
aVlike are invisible.
p398
aVBecause when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
p399
aVBut if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
p400
aVyou will miss the point
p401
aVbecause the actual journey happens between those footprints,
p402
aVand the footprints are nothing but passing time.
p403
aa(lp404
VThank you.
