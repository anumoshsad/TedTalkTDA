VThe AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere
p4
aVin an echo-free chamber.
p5
aVThink of the AlloSphere as a large,
p6
aVdynamically varying digital microscope
p7
aVthat's connected to a supercomputer.
p8
aV20 researchers can stand on a bridge
p9
aVsuspended inside of the sphere, and be
p10
aVcompletely immersed in their data.
p11
aa(lp12
VImagine if a team of physicists
p13
aVcould stand inside of an atom
p14
aVand watch and hear electrons spin.
p15
aVImagine if a group of sculptors
p16
aVcould be inside of a lattice of atoms
p17
aVand sculpt with their material.
p18
aVImagine if a team of surgeons could fly
p19
aVinto the brain, as though it was a world,
p20
aVand see tissues as landscapes,
p21
aVand hear blood density levels as music.
p22
aVThis is some of the research that you're going to see
p23
aVthat we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut first a little bit about this group
p26
aVof artists, scientists, and engineers
p27
aVthat are working together.
p28
aVI'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,
p29
aVand the inventor of the AlloSphere.
p30
aVWith my visual artist colleagues, we map
p31
aVcomplex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,
p32
aVvisually and sonically.
p33
aVOur scientist colleagues are finding new patterns
p34
aVin the information.
p35
aVAnd our engineering colleagues are making
p36
aVone of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world
p37
aVfor this kind of data exploration.
p38
aVI'm going to fly you into five research projects
p39
aVin the AlloSphere that are going to take you from
p40
aVbiological macroscopic data
p41
aVall the way down to electron spin.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis first project is called the AlloBrain.
p44
aVAnd it's our attempt to quantify beauty
p45
aVby finding which regions of the brain
p46
aVare interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
p47
aVYou're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.
p48
aVOur narrative here is real fMRI data
p49
aVthat's mapped visually and sonically.
p50
aVThe brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.
p51
aVYou see 12 intelligent computer agents,
p52
aVthe little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
p53
aVThey're mining blood density levels.
p54
aVAnd they're reporting them back to you sonically.
p55
aVHigher density levels mean
p56
aVmore activity in that point of the brain.
p57
aVThey're actually singing these densities to you
p58
aVwith higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe're now going to move from real biological data
p61
aVto biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature
p62
aVin our next artistic and scientific installation.
p63
aVIn this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms
p64
aVare helping us to understand
p65
aVself-generation and growth:
p66
aVvery important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
p67
aVFor artists, we're making new worlds
p68
aVthat we can uncover and explore.
p69
aVThese generative algorithms grow over time,
p70
aVand they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
p71
aVOur researchers are interacting with this data
p72
aVby injecting bacterial code,
p73
aVwhich are computer programs,
p74
aVthat allow these creatures to grow over time.
p75
aVWe're going to move now from the biological
p76
aVand the macroscopic world,
p77
aVdown into the atomic world,
p78
aVas we fly into a lattice of atoms.
p79
aVThis is real AFM \u2014 Atomic Force Microscope \u2014 data
p80
aVfrom my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.
p81
aVThey've discovered a new bond,
p82
aVa new material for transparent solar cells.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms \u2014
p85
aVoxygen, hydrogen and zinc.
p86
aVYou view the bond in the triangle.
p87
aVIt's four blue zinc atoms
p88
aVbonding with one white hydrogen atom.
p89
aVYou see the electron flow with the streamlines
p90
aVwe as artists have generated for the scientists.
p91
aVThis is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.
p92
aVWe think it makes a beautiful structural art.
p93
aVThe sound that you're hearing are the actual
p94
aVemission spectrums of these atoms.
p95
aVWe've mapped them into the audio domain,
p96
aVso they're singing to you.
p97
aVOxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.
p98
aVWe're going to actually move even further down
p99
aVas we go from this lattice of atoms
p100
aVto one single hydrogen atom.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe're working with our physicist colleagues
p103
aVthat have given us the mathematical calculations
p104
aVof the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.
p105
aVWhat you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron
p106
aVin the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
p107
aVYou're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
p108
aVThe white dots are the probability wave
p109
aVthat will show you where the electron is
p110
aVin any given point of time and space
p111
aVin this particular three-orbital configuration.
p112
aVIn a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,
p113
aVand you're going to notice a pulsing.
p114
aVAnd you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.
p115
aVThis is actually a light emitter.
p116
aVAs the sound starts to pulse and contract,
p117
aVour physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.
p118
aa(lp119
VThey're starting to find new mathematical structures
p120
aVin these calculations.
p121
aVAnd they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.
p122
aVWe're going to move even further down,
p123
aVand go to one single electron spin.
p124
aVThis will be the final project that I show you.
p125
aVOur colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation
p126
aVand Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers
p127
aVdecoherence in a single electron spin.
p128
aVWe've taken this information and we've
p129
aVmade a mathematical model out of it.
p130
aVYou're actually seeing and hearing
p131
aVquantum information flow.
p132
aVThis is very important for the next step in simulating
p133
aVquantum computers and information technology.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo these brief examples that I've shown you
p136
aVgive you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing
p137
aVat the University of California, Santa Barbara,
p138
aVto bring together, arts, science
p139
aVand engineering
p140
aVinto a new age of math, science and art.
p141
aVWe hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.
p142
aVInspire us to think of new ways that we can use
p143
aVthis unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.
p144
aVThank you very much.
