VI'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
p4
aVin the 21st century.
p5
aVIn the 21st century, we need to actually look at \u2014
p6
aVand what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today \u2014
p7
aVis to go back to our school days
p8
aVwhen we learned how to count.
p9
aVBut I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
p10
aVBecause what we actually count
p11
aVtruly counts.
p12
aa(lp13
VLet me start by telling you a little story.
p14
aVThis is Van Quach.
p15
aVShe came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
p16
aVShe changed her name to Vivian
p17
aVbecause she wanted to fit in here in America.
p18
aVHer first job was at an inner-city motel
p19
aVin San Francisco as a maid.
p20
aVI happened to buy that motel
p21
aVabout three months after Vivian started working there.
p22
aVSo Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
p23
aa(lp24
VWith the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,
p25
aVin 1987,
p26
aVI started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
p27
aVa very impractical name,
p28
aVbecause I actually was looking to create joy of life.
p29
aVAnd this first hotel that I bought, motel,
p30
aVwas a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
p31
aVin the inner-city of San Francisco.
p32
aVAs I spent time with Vivian,
p33
aVI saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
p34
aVin how she did her work.
p35
aVIt made me question and curious:
p36
aVHow could someone actually find joy
p37
aVin cleaning toilets for a living?
p38
aVSo I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
p39
aVshe didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
p40
aVHer job, her goal and her calling
p41
aVwas not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
p42
aVWhat counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
p43
aVshe created with her fellow employees and our guests.
p44
aVAnd what gave her inspiration and meaning
p45
aVwas the fact that she was taking care of people
p46
aVwho were far away from home.
p47
aVBecause Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
p48
aa(lp49
VThat very human lesson,
p50
aVmore than 20 years ago,
p51
aVserved me well during the last
p52
aVeconomic downturn we had.
p53
aVIn the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
p54
aVSan Francisco Bay Area hotels
p55
aVwent through the largest percentage revenue drop
p56
aVin the history of American hotels.
p57
aVWe were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
p58
aVso we were particularly vulnerable.
p59
aVBut also back then,
p60
aVremember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
p61
aVWell, not exactly, of course not.
p62
aVWe started eating "freedom fries,"
p63
aVand we started boycotting anything that was French.
p64
aVWell, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre \u2014
p65
aVso I started getting these letters
p66
aVfrom places like Alabama and Orange County
p67
aVsaying to me that they were going to boycott my company
p68
aVbecause they thought we were a French company.
p69
aVAnd I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.
p70
aVWe're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."
p71
aVAnd I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo one particular day
p76
aVwhen I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
p77
aVI ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
p78
aVAnd I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
p79
aVlooking for a business solution.
p80
aVBut given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
p81
aVin the self-help section very quickly.
p82
aVThat's where I got reacquainted with
p83
aVAbraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."
p84
aVI took one psychology class in college,
p85
aVand I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
p86
aVas many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
p87
aVBut as I sat there for four hours,
p88
aVthe full afternoon, reading Maslow,
p89
aVI recognized something
p90
aVthat is true of most leaders.
p91
aVOne of the simplest facts in business
p92
aVis something that we often neglect,
p93
aVand that is that we're all human.
p94
aVEach of us, no matter what our role is in business,
p95
aVhas some hierarchy of needs
p96
aVin the workplace.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo as I started reading more Maslow,
p99
aVwhat I started to realize is that
p100
aVMaslow, later in his life,
p101
aVwanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
p102
aVand apply it to the collective,
p103
aVto organizations and specifically to business.
p104
aVBut unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
p105
aVand so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
p106
aVSo I realized in that dotcom crash
p107
aVthat my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
p108
aVAnd that's what I did a few years ago
p109
aVwhen I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
p110
aVand turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
p111
aVwhich is survival, success and transformation.
p112
aVIt's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
p113
aVAnd we started asking ourselves the questions
p114
aVabout how we were actually addressing
p115
aVthe higher needs, these transformational needs
p116
aVfor our key employees in the company.
p117
aVThese three levels of the hierarchy needs
p118
aVrelate to the five levels
p119
aVof Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing
p122
aVthe higher needs of our employees and our customers,
p123
aVI realized we had no metrics.
p124
aVWe had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
p125
aVSo we started asking ourselves:
p126
aVWhat kind of less obvious metrics
p127
aVcould we use to actually evaluate
p128
aVour employees' sense of meaning,
p129
aVor our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?
p130
aVFor example, we actually started asking our employees,
p131
aVdo they understand the mission of our company,
p132
aVand do they feel like they believe in it,
p133
aVcan they actually influence it,
p134
aVand do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
p135
aVWe started asking our customers,
p136
aVdid they feel an emotional connection with us,
p137
aVin one of seven different kinds of ways.
p138
aVMiraculously, as we asked these questions
p139
aVand started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
p140
aVwhat we found is we created more loyalty.
p141
aVOur customer loyalty skyrocketed.
p142
aVOur employee turnover dropped
p143
aVto one-third of the industry average,
p144
aVand during that five year dotcom bust,
p145
aVwe tripled in size.
p146
aa(lp147
VAs I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there
p148
aVand asking them how they were getting through that time,
p149
aVwhat they told me over and over again
p150
aVwas that they just manage what they can measure.
p151
aVWhat we can measure is that tangible stuff
p152
aVat the bottom of the pyramid.
p153
aVThey didn't even see the intangible stuff
p154
aVhigher up the pyramid.
p155
aVSo I started asking myself the question:
p156
aVHow can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
p157
aVIf we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
p158
aVand all we can measure is the tangible in life,
p159
aVwe're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I went out and studied a bunch of things,
p162
aVand I found a survey that showed
p163
aVthat 94 percent
p164
aVof business leaders worldwide
p165
aVbelieve that the intangibles are important in their business,
p166
aVthings like intellectual property,
p167
aVtheir corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
p168
aVand yet, only five percent of those same leaders
p169
aVactually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
p170
aVSo as leaders, we understand
p171
aVthat intangibles are important,
p172
aVbut we don't have a clue how to measure them.
p173
aVSo here's another Einstein quote:
p174
aV"Not everything that can be counted counts,
p175
aVand not everything that counts can be counted."
p176
aVI hate to argue with Einstein,
p177
aVbut if that which is most valuable
p178
aVin our life and our business
p179
aVactually can't be counted or valued,
p180
aVaren't we going to spend our lives
p181
aVjust mired in measuring the mundane?
p182
aa(lp183
VIt was that sort of heady question about what counts
p184
aVthat led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
p185
aVand fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
p186
aVI flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
p187
aVa place some folks call Shangri-La.
p188
aVIt's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
p189
aVto becoming a transformational
p190
aVrole model for the world.
p191
aVI went to Bhutan.
p192
aVThe teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
p193
aVbut this was back in 1972,
p194
aVwhen he ascended to the throne
p195
aVtwo days after his father passed away.
p196
aVAt age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
p197
aVthat you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
p198
aa(lp199
VOn a trip through India,
p200
aVearly in his reign as king,
p201
aVhe was asked by an Indian journalist
p202
aVabout the Bhutanese GDP,
p203
aVthe size of the Bhutanese GDP.
p204
aVThe king responded in a fashion
p205
aVthat actually has transformed us four decades later.
p206
aVHe said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed
p207
aVand focused with gross domestic product?
p208
aVWhy don't we care more about
p209
aVgross national happiness?"
p210
aVNow, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
p211
aVan alternative definition of success,
p212
aVwhat has come to be known as
p213
aVGNH, or gross national happiness.
p214
aVMost world leaders didn't take notice,
p215
aVand those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."
p216
aVBut the king was serious.
p217
aVThis was a notable moment,
p218
aVbecause this was the first time a world leader
p219
aVin almost 200 years
p220
aVhad suggested
p221
aVthat intangible of happiness \u2014
p222
aVthat leader 200 years ago,
p223
aVThomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence \u2014
p224
aV200 years later,
p225
aVthis king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
p226
aVis something that we should measure,
p227
aVand it's something we should actually value
p228
aVas government officials.
p229
aa(lp230
VFor the next three dozen years as king,
p231
aVthis king actually started measuring
p232
aVand managing around happiness in Bhutan \u2014
p233
aVincluding, just recently, taking his country
p234
aVfrom being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
p235
aVwith no bloodshed, no coup.
p236
aVBhutan, for those of you who don't know it,
p237
aVis the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,
p240
aVI got to really understand what they're doing.
p241
aVAnd I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
p242
aVOver dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
p243
aVI asked him,
p244
aV"How can you create and measure
p245
aVsomething which evaporates \u2014
p246
aVin other words, happiness?"
p247
aVAnd he's a very wise man, and he said,
p248
aV"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.
p249
aVWe create the conditions for happiness to occur.
p250
aVIn other words, we create a habitat of happiness."
p251
aVWow, that's interesting.
p252
aVHe said that they have a science behind that art,
p253
aVand they've actually created four essential pillars,
p254
aVnine key indicators
p255
aVand 72 different metrics
p256
aVthat help them to measure their GNH.
p257
aVOne of those key indicators is:
p258
aVHow do the Bhutanese feel about
p259
aVhow they spend their time each day?
p260
aVIt's a good question. How do you feel about
p261
aVhow you spend your time each day?
p262
aVTime is one of the scarcest resources
p263
aVin the modern world.
p264
aVAnd yet, of course,
p265
aVthat little intangible piece of data
p266
aVdoesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
p267
aa(lp268
VAs I spent my week up in the Himalayas,
p269
aVI started to imagine
p270
aVwhat I call an emotional equation.
p271
aVAnd it focuses on something I read long ago
p272
aVfrom a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
p273
aVHow many know him? Anybody?
p274
aV1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"
p275
aVand he suggested that happiness
p276
aVis not about having what you want;
p277
aVinstead, it's about wanting what you have.
p278
aVOr in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
p279
aVhappiness equals wanting what you have \u2014
p280
aVimagine gratitude \u2014
p281
aVdivided by having what you want \u2014
p282
aVgratification.
p283
aVThe Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,
p284
aVconstantly focused on what they don't have.
p285
aVTheir religion, their isolation,
p286
aVtheir deep respect for their culture
p287
aVand now the principles of their GNH movement
p288
aVall have fostered a sense of gratitude
p289
aVabout what they do have.
p290
aVHow many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
p291
aVspend more of our time
p292
aVin the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
p293
aVWe are a bottom-heavy culture
p294
aVin more ways than one.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VThe reality is, in Western countries,
p299
aVquite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness
p300
aVas if happiness is something that we have to go out \u2014
p301
aVan object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.
p302
aVActually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,
p303
aVmany dictionaries define pursuit
p304
aVas to "chase with hostility."
p305
aVDo we pursue happiness with hostility?
p306
aVGood question. But back to Bhutan.
p307
aa(lp308
VBhutan's bordered on its north and south
p309
aVby 38 percent of the world's population.
p310
aVCould this little country,
p311
aVlike a startup in a mature industry,
p312
aVbe the spark plug that influences
p313
aVa 21st century
p314
aVof middle-class in China and India?
p315
aVBhutan's created the ultimate export,
p316
aVa new global currency of well-being,
p317
aVand there are 40 countries around the world today
p318
aVthat are studying their own GNH.
p319
aVYou may have heard, this last fall
p320
aVNicolas Sarkozy in France
p321
aVannouncing the results of an 18-month study
p322
aVby two Nobel economists,
p323
aVfocusing on happiness and wellness in France.
p324
aVSarkozy suggested that
p325
aVworld leaders should stop
p326
aVmyopically focusing on GDP
p327
aVand consider a new index,
p328
aVwhat some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."
p329
aVI like it.
p330
aVCo-branding opportunities.
p331
aa(lp332
VJust three days ago, three days ago here at TED,
p333
aVwe had a simulcast of David Cameron,
p334
aVpotentially the next prime minister of the UK,
p335
aVquoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,
p336
aVRobert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968
p337
aVwhen he suggested that we're
p338
aVmyopically focused on the wrong thing
p339
aVand that GDP is a misplaced metric.
p340
aVSo it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
p341
aa(lp342
VI've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,
p343
aVand I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
p344
aVThis is a collection of things
p345
aVthat Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
p346
aVGDP counts everything from air pollution
p347
aVto the destruction of our redwoods.
p348
aVBut it doesn't count the health of our children
p349
aVor the integrity of our public officials.
p350
aVAs you look at these two columns here,
p351
aVdoesn't it make you feel like it's time for us
p352
aVto start figuring out a new way to count,
p353
aVa new way to imagine
p354
aVwhat's important to us in life?
p355
aa(lp356
V(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VCertainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.
p359
aVHe said GDP "measures everything in short,
p360
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile."
p361
aVWow.
p362
aVSo how do we do that?
p363
aVLet me say one thing we can just start doing
p364
aVten years from now, at least in this country.
p365
aVWhy in the heck in America
p366
aVare we doing a census in 2010?
p367
aVWe're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
p368
aVWe're asking 10 simple questions \u2014 it is simplicity.
p369
aVBut all of those questions are tangible.
p370
aVThey're about demographics.
p371
aVThey're about where you live, how many people you live with,
p372
aVand whether you own your home or not.
p373
aVThat's about it.
p374
aVWe're not asking meaningful metrics.
p375
aVWe're not asking important questions.
p376
aVWe're not asking anything that's intangible.
p377
aa(lp378
VAbe Maslow said long ago
p379
aVsomething you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
p380
aVHe said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,
p381
aVeverything starts to look like a nail."
p382
aVWe've been fooled by our tool.
p383
aVExcuse that expression.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVWe've been fooled by our tool.
p386
aVGDP has been our hammer.
p387
aVAnd our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century
p388
aVindustrial-era model of success.
p389
aVAnd yet, 64 percent
p390
aVof the world's GDP today
p391
aVis in that intangible industry we call service,
p392
aVthe service industry, the industry I'm in.
p393
aVAnd only 36 percent is in the tangible industries
p394
aVof manufacturing and agriculture.
p395
aVSo maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?
p396
aVMaybe it's time we get a toolbox that
p397
aVdoesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,
p398
aVbut actually counts what we most value,
p399
aVthe things that are intangible.
p400
aa(lp401
VI guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.
p402
aVI was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.
p403
aVI learned that economists measure everything
p404
aVin tangible units of production and consumption
p405
aVas if each of those tangible units
p406
aVis exactly the same.
p407
aVThey aren't the same.
p408
aVIn fact, as leaders, what we need to learn
p409
aVis that we can influence
p410
aVthe quality of that unit of production
p411
aVby creating the conditions
p412
aVfor our employees to live their calling.
p413
aVIn Vivian's case,
p414
aVher unit of production
p415
aVisn't the tangible hours she works,
p416
aVit's the intangible difference she makes
p417
aVduring that one hour of work.
p418
aa(lp419
VThis is Dave Arringdale who's actually
p420
aVbeen a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
p421
aVHe stayed there a hundred times
p422
aVin the last 20 years,
p423
aVand he's loyal to the property because of the relationship
p424
aVthat Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
p425
aVThey've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
p426
aVHe tells me that he can always count
p427
aVon Vivian and the staff there
p428
aVto make him feel at home.
p429
aVWhy is it that
p430
aVbusiness leaders and investors
p431
aVquite often don't see the connection
p432
aVbetween creating the intangible
p433
aVof employee happiness
p434
aVwith creating the tangible
p435
aVof financial profits in their business?
p436
aVWe don't have to choose between
p437
aVinspired employees and sizable profits,
p438
aVwe can have both.
p439
aVIn fact, inspired employees quite often
p440
aVhelp make sizable profits, right?
p441
aa(lp442
VSo what the world needs now,
p443
aVin my opinion,
p444
aVis business leaders and political leaders
p445
aVwho know what to count.
p446
aVWe count numbers.
p447
aVWe count on people.
p448
aVWhat really counts is when we actually use our numbers
p449
aVto truly take into account our people.
p450
aVI learned that from a maid in a motel
p451
aVand a king of a country.
p452
aVWhat can you
p453
aVstart counting today?
p454
aVWhat one thing can you start counting today
p455
aVthat actually would be meaningful in your life,
p456
aVwhether it's your work life or your business life?
p457
