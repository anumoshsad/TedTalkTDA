p7
aa(lp8
VSo what the hell was that?
p9
aVWell, you don't know because you couldn't understand it.
p10
aVIt wasn't clear.
p11
aVBut hopefully, it was said with enough conviction
p12
aVthat it was at least alluringly mysterious.
p13
aa(lp14
VClarity or mystery?
p15
aVI'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer,
p16
aVas well as my daily life as a New Yorker
p17
aVevery day,
p18
aVand there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me.
p19
aa(lp20
VHere's an example.
p21
aVNow, how many people know what this is?
p22
aVOkay. Now how many people know what this is?
p23
aVOkay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz,
p24
aVwe now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves
p25
aVcreate an entire emotional life,
p26
aVone that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans
p27
aVfor over 50 years.
p28
aVThis is actually a cover of a book
p29
aVthat I designed about the work of Schulz and his art,
p30
aVwhich will be coming out this fall,
p31
aVand that is the entire cover.
p32
aVThere is no other typographic information or visual information on the front,
p33
aVand the name of the book is "Only What's Necessary."
p34
aVSo this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day
p35
aVabout the design that I'm perceiving,
p36
aVand the design I'm creating.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo clarity.
p39
aVClarity gets to the point.
p40
aVIt's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.
p41
aVWe ask ourselves this. ["When should you be clear?"]
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, something like this, whether we can read it or not,
p44
aVneeds to be really, really clear.
p45
aVIs it?
p46
aa(lp47
VThis is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love,
p48
aVmainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry.
p49
aVSo when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners,
p50
aVI was thrilled, because now I finally knew
p51
aVhow many seconds I had to get across the street
p52
aVbefore I got run over by a car.
p53
aVSix? I can do that. (Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo let's look at the yin to the clarity yang,
p56
aVand that is mystery.
p57
aVMystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition.
p58
aVMystery demands to be decoded,
p59
aVand when it's done right, we really, really want to.
p60
aV["When should you be mysterious?"]
p61
aVIn World War II, the Germans really, really wanted to decode this,
p62
aVand they couldn't.
p63
aa(lp64
VHere's an example of a design that I've done recently
p65
aVfor a novel by Haruki Murakami,
p66
aVwho I've done design work for for over 20 years now,
p67
aVand this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends
p68
aVwho all of a sudden, after their freshman year of college,
p69
aVcompletely cut him off with no explanation,
p70
aVand he is devastated.
p71
aVAnd the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color.
p72
aVSo there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue, there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.
p73
aVTsukuru Tazaki, his name does not correspond to a color,
p74
aVso his nickname is Colorless, and as he's looking back on their friendship,
p75
aVhe recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand.
p76
aVSo I created this sort of abstract representation of this,
p77
aVbut there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story,
p78
aVand there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket.
p79
aVThe four fingers are now four train lines
p80
aVin the Tokyo subway system,
p81
aVwhich has significance within the story.
p82
aVAnd then you have the colorless subway line
p83
aVintersecting with each of the other colors,
p84
aVwhich basically he does later on in the story.
p85
aVHe catches up with each of these people
p86
aVto find out why they treated him the way they did.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd so this is the three-dimensional finished product
p89
aVsitting on my desk in my office,
p90
aVand what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured
p91
aVby the mystery of what this looks like,
p92
aVand will want to read it
p93
aVto decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.
p94
aa(lp95
V["The Visual Vernacular."]
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery.
p98
aVWhat does this mean?
p99
aVThis is what it means. ["Make it look like something else."]
p100
aVThe visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing
p101
aVapplied to something else so that we see it in a different way.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris
p104
aVthat had this title at the time. ["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]
p105
aVNow, the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing.
p106
aVIt's not connected to any of the essays in the book.
p107
aVIt came to the author's boyfriend in a dream.
p108
aVThank you very much, so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 so usually, I am creating a design
p109
aVthat is in some way based on the text, but this is all the text there is.
p110
aVSo you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything,
p111
aVso I was trying to think:
p112
aVWhere might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't?
p113
aVAnd sure enough, not long after,
p114
aVone evening after a Chinese meal,
p115
aVthis arrived, and I thought, "Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)
p116
aVI've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies
p117
aVthat seem to mean something extremely deep
p118
aVbut when you think about them \u2014 if you think about them \u2014 they really don't.
p119
aVThis says, "Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future."
p120
aVThank you. (Laughter)
p121
aVBut we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,
p122
aVand we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look
p123
aVthat we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore.
p124
aVWe're just seeing this strange thing
p125
aVand we know we love David Sedaris,
p126
aVand so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.
p127
aa(lp128
V["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"] David Rakoff was a wonderful writer
p129
aVand he called his first book "Fraud"
p130
aVbecause he was getting sent on assignments by magazines
p131
aVto do things that he was not equipped to do.
p132
aVSo he was this skinny little urban guy
p133
aVand GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River
p134
aVwhitewater rafting to see if he would survive.
p135
aVAnd then he would write about it, and he felt that he was a fraud
p136
aVand that he was misrepresenting himself.
p137
aVAnd so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself
p138
aVand then somehow show a reader reacting to it.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis led me to graffiti.
p141
aVI'm fascinated by graffiti.
p142
aVI think anybody who lives in an urban environment
p143
aVencounters graffiti all the time, and there's all different sorts of it.
p144
aVThis is a picture I took on the Lower East Side
p145
aVof just a transformer box on the sidewalk
p146
aVand it's been tagged like crazy.
p147
aVNow whether you look at this and think, "Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"
p148
aVor you look at it and say, "That's illegal abuse of property,"
p149
aVthe one thing I think we can all agree on
p150
aVis that you cannot read it.
p151
aVRight? There is no clear message here.
p152
aVThere is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting,
p153
aVwhich I call editorial graffiti.
p154
aVThis is a picture I took recently in the subway,
p155
aVand sometimes you see lots of prurient, stupid stuff,
p156
aVbut I thought this was interesting, and this is a poster that is saying
p157
aVrah-rah Airbnb,
p158
aVand someone has taken a Magic Marker
p159
aVand has editorialized about what they think about it.
p160
aVAnd it got my attention.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I was thinking, how do we apply this to this book?
p163
aVSo I get the book by this person, and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,
p164
aVthis guy is not who he says  he is; he's a fraud.
p165
aVAnd I get out a red Magic Marker,
p166
aVand out of frustration just scribble this across the front.
p167
aVDesign done. (Laughter)
p168
aVAnd they went for it! (Laughter)
p169
aVAuthor liked it, publisher liked it,
p170
aVand that is how the book went out into the world,
p171
aVand it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway
p172
aVand walking around with it and what have you,
p173
aVand they all sort of looked like they were crazy.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
V["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"] Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,
p177
aVa good friend, I've worked with him for many years.
p178
aVHe is probably best known as the author
p179
aVof "The Black Dahlia" and "L.A. Confidential."
p180
aVHis most recent novel was called this, which is a very mysterious name
p181
aVthat I'm sure a lot of people know what it means, but a lot of people don't.
p182
aVAnd it's a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941
p183
aVinvestigating a murder.
p184
aVAnd then Pearl Harbor happens,
p185
aVand as if his life wasn't difficult enough,
p186
aVnow the race relations have really ratcheted up,
p187
aVand then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created,
p188
aVand there's lots of tension
p189
aVand horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder.
p190
aVAnd so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of
p191
aVall right, we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles
p192
aVand we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city.
p193
aVAnd so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor
p194
aVjust grafted onto Los Angeles.
p195
aVMy editor in chief said, "You know, it's interesting
p196
aVbut I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler."
p197
aVAnd so I went back to the drawing board, as I often do.
p198
aVBut also, being alive to my surroundings,
p199
aVI work in a high-rise in Midtown,
p200
aVand every night, before I leave the office,
p201
aVI have to push this button to get out,
p202
aVand the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator.
p203
aVAnd one night, all of a sudden,
p204
aVI looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before.
p205
aVBig red circle, danger.
p206
aVAnd I thought this was so obvious
p207
aVthat it had to have been done a zillion times,
p208
aVand so I did a Google image search, and I couldn't find another book cover
p209
aVthat looked quite like this,
p210
aVand so this is really what solved the problem,
p211
aVand graphically it's more interesting
p212
aVand creates a bigger tension between the idea
p213
aVof a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.
p214
aa(lp215
V["'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach."]
p216
aa(lp217
VMary Roach is an amazing writer
p218
aVwho takes potentially mundane scientific subjects
p219
aVand makes them not mundane at all; she makes them really fun.
p220
aVSo in this particular case,
p221
aVit's about the human digestive system.
p222
aVSo I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be.
p223
aVThis is a self-portrait. (Laughter)
p224
aVEvery morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror
p225
aVto see if my tongue is black.
p226
aVAnd if it's not, I'm good to go.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVI recommend you all do this.
p229
aVBut I also started thinking, here's our introduction.
p230
aVRight? Into the human digestive system.
p231
aVBut I think what we can all agree on
p232
aVis that actual photographs of human mouths, at least based on this,
p233
aVare off-putting. (Laughter)
p234
aVSo for the cover, then, I had this illustration done
p235
aVwhich is literally more palatable
p236
aVand reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system
p237
aVfrom this end.
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVI don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.
p240
aa(lp241
V["Unuseful mystery"]
p242
aVWhat happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up?
p243
aVAnd we see this all the time.
p244
aVThis is what I call unuseful mystery.
p245
aVI go down into the subway \u2014 I take the subway a lot \u2014
p246
aVand this piece of paper is taped to a girder.
p247
aVRight? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,
p248
aVand the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means,
p249
aVand thanks a lot.
p250
aVPart of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information
p251
aVin a way they think is helpful, and frankly, I don't think it is at all.
p252
aVSo this is mystery we do not need.
p253
aVWhat we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this.
p254
aVThis is using all the same elements.
p255
aV(Applause)
p256
aVThank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)
p257
aVYou know, I'm actually not even using more colors than they use.
p258
aVThey just didn't even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green,
p259
aVthose idiots. (Laughter)
p260
aVSo the first thing we see is that there is a service change,
p261
aVand then, in two complete sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end,
p262
aVit tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening.
p263
aVCall me crazy! (Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
V["Useful mystery"] All right.
p266
aVNow, here is a piece of mystery that I love:
p267
aVpackaging.
p268
aVThis redesign of the Diet Coke can
p269
aVby Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art.
p270
aVIt's a work of art. It's beautiful.
p271
aVBut part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer
p272
aVis that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke \u2014
p273
aVthe typefaces, the colors, the silver background \u2014
p274
aVand he's reduced them to their most essential parts,
p275
aVso it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face.
p276
aVIt's like, how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is
p277
aVbut giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have
p278
aVabout this thing?
p279
aVIt looks great, and you would go into a delicatessen
p280
aVand all of a sudden see that on the shelf, and it's wonderful.
p281
aVWhich makes the next thing \u2014
p282
aV["Unuseful clarity"] \u2014 all the more disheartening,
p283
aVat least to me.
p284
aVSo okay, again, going back down into the subway,
p285
aVafter this came out,
p286
aVthese are pictures that I took.
p287
aVTimes Square subway station:
p288
aVCoca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay?
p289
aVAnd maybe some of you know where this is going.
p290
aVAhem.
p291
aa(lp292
V"You moved to New York with the clothes on your back,
p293
aVthe cash in your pocket, and your eyes on the prize.
p294
aVYou're on Coke." (Laughter)
p295
aV"You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit,
p296
aVand an extremely firm handshake.
p297
aVYou're on Coke." (Laughter)
p298
aVThese are real! (Laughter)
p299
aVNot even the support beams were spared,
p300
aVexcept they switched into Yoda mode. (Laughter)
p301
aV"Coke you're on." (Laughter)
p302
aV["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"]
p303
aVThis campaign was a huge misstep.
p304
aVIt was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash
p305
aVand all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web \u2014
p306
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p307
aVand also that dot next to "You're on," that's not a period, that's a trademark.
p308
aVSo thanks a lot.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo to me, this was just so bizarre
p311
aVabout how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect
p312
aVand the message so unbearably, clearly wrong.
p313
aVIt was just incredible to me.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights
p316
aVon the uses of clarity and mystery in my work,
p317
aVand maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life,
p318
aVor maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk,
p322
