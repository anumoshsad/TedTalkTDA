VEinstein said that
p4
aV"I never think about the future \u2014 it comes soon enough."
p5
aa(lp6
VAnd he was right, of course.
p7
aVSo today, I'm here to ask you to think of
p8
aVhow the future is happening now.
p9
aVOver the past 200 years, the world has experienced
p10
aVtwo major waves of innovation.
p11
aVFirst, the Industrial Revolution
p12
aVbrought us machines and factories, railways,
p13
aVelectricity, air travel,
p14
aVand our lives have never been the same.
p15
aVThen the Internet revolution
p16
aVbrought us computing power, data networks,
p17
aVunprecedented access
p18
aVto information and communication,
p19
aVand our lives have never been the same.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow we are experiencing
p22
aVanother metamorphic change:
p23
aVthe industrial Internet.
p24
aVIt brings together intelligent machines,
p25
aVadvanced analytics,
p26
aVand the creativity of people at work.
p27
aVIt's the marriage of minds and machines.
p28
aVAnd our lives will never be the same.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn my current role, I see up close
p31
aVhow technology is beginning to transform
p32
aVindustrial sectors that play a huge role
p33
aVin our economy and in our lives:
p34
aVenergy, aviation, transportation, health care.
p35
aVFor an economist, this is highly unusual,
p36
aVand it's extremely exciting,
p37
aVbecause this is a transformation
p38
aVas powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,
p39
aVand before the Industrial Revolution,
p40
aVthere was no economic growth to speak of.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo what is this industrial Internet?
p43
aVIndustrial machines are being equipped
p44
aVwith a growing number of electronic sensors
p45
aVthat allow them to see, hear, feel
p46
aVa lot more than ever before,
p47
aVgenerating prodigious amounts of data.
p48
aVIncreasingly sophisticated analytics
p49
aVthen sift through the data,
p50
aVproviding insights that allow us
p51
aVto operate the machines in entirely new ways,
p52
aVa lot more efficiently.
p53
aVAnd not just individual machines,
p54
aVbut fleets of locomotives, airplanes,
p55
aVentire systems like power grids, hospitals.
p56
aVIt is asset optimization and system optimization.
p57
aVOf course, electronic sensors
p58
aVhave been around for some time,
p59
aVbut something has changed:
p60
aVa sharp decline in the cost of sensors
p61
aVand, thanks to advances in cloud computing,
p62
aVa rapid decrease in the cost of storing
p63
aVand processing data.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo we are moving to a world
p66
aVwhere the machines we work with
p67
aVare not just intelligent; they are brilliant.
p68
aVThey are self-aware, they are predictive,
p69
aVreactive and social.
p70
aVIt's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,
p71
aVmedical devices, communicating seamlessly
p72
aVwith each other and with us.
p73
aVIt's a world where information itself
p74
aVbecomes intelligent and comes to us
p75
aVautomatically when we need it
p76
aVwithout having to look for it.
p77
aVWe are beginning to deploy
p78
aVthroughout the industrial system
p79
aVembedded virtualization,
p80
aVmulti-core processor technology,
p81
aVadvanced cloud-based communications,
p82
aVa new software-defined machine infrastructure
p83
aVwhich allows machine functionality
p84
aVto become virtualized in software,
p85
aVdecoupling machine software from hardware,
p86
aVand allowing us to remotely and automatically
p87
aVmonitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.
p88
aa(lp89
VWhy does any of this matter at all?
p90
aVWell first of all, it's already allowing us
p91
aVto shift towards preventive,
p92
aVcondition-based maintenance,
p93
aVwhich means fixing machines
p94
aVjust before they break,
p95
aVwithout wasting time
p96
aVservicing them on a fixed schedule.
p97
aVAnd this, in turn, is pushing us towards
p98
aVzero unplanned downtime,
p99
aVwhich means there will be no more power outages,
p100
aVno more flight delays.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo let me give you a few examples
p103
aVof how these brilliant machines work,
p104
aVand some of the examples may seem trivial,
p105
aVsome are clearly more profound,
p106
aVbut all of them are going to have a very powerful impact.
p107
aa(lp108
VLet's start with aviation.
p109
aVToday, 10 percent of all flights
p110
aVcancellations and delays
p111
aVare due to unscheduled maintenance events.
p112
aVSomething goes wrong unexpectedly.
p113
aVThis results in eight billion dollars in costs
p114
aVfor the airline industry globally every year,
p115
aVnot to mention the impact on all of us:
p116
aVstress, inconvenience,
p117
aVmissed meetings as we sit helplessly
p118
aVin an airport terminal.
p119
aVSo how can the industrial Internet help here?
p120
aVWe've developed a preventive maintenance system
p121
aVwhich can be installed on any aircraft.
p122
aVIt's self-learning and able to predict issues
p123
aVthat a human operator would miss.
p124
aVThe aircraft, while in flight,
p125
aVwill communicate with technicians on the ground.
p126
aVBy the time it lands, they will already know
p127
aVif anything needs to be serviced.
p128
aVJust in the U.S., a system like this can prevent
p129
aVover 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,
p130
aVhelping seven million passengers
p131
aVget to their destinations on time.
p132
aa(lp133
VOr take healthcare.
p134
aVToday, nurses spend an average
p135
aVof 21 minutes per shift
p136
aVlooking for medical equipment.
p137
aVThat seems trivial, but it's less time spent
p138
aVcaring for patients.
p139
aVSt. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,
p140
aVwhich has deployed industrial Internet technology
p141
aVto electronically monitor and connect
p142
aVpatients, staff and medical equipment,
p143
aVhas reduced bed turnaround times
p144
aVby nearly one hour.
p145
aVIf you need surgery, one hour matters.
p146
aVIt means more patients can be treated,
p147
aVmore lives can be saved.
p148
aVAnother medical center, in Washington state,
p149
aVis piloting an application that allows
p150
aVmedical images from city scanners and MRIs
p151
aVto be analyzed in the cloud,
p152
aVdeveloping better analytics
p153
aVat a lower cost.
p154
aVImagine a patient
p155
aVwho has suffered a severe trauma,
p156
aVand needs the attention of several specialists:
p157
aVa neurologist, a cardiologist,
p158
aVan orthopedic surgeon.
p159
aVIf all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access
p160
aVto scans and images as they are taken,
p161
aVthey will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.
p162
aVSo all of this translates into better health outcomes,
p163
aVbut it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.
p164
aVJust a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies
p165
aVcould yield savings of over 60 billion dollars
p166
aVto the healthcare industry worldwide,
p167
aVand that is just a drop in the sea
p168
aVcompared to what we need to do to make healthcare
p169
aVaffordable on a sustainable basis.
p170
aa(lp171
VSimilar advances are happening in energy,
p172
aVincluding renewable energy.
p173
aVWind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics
p174
aVthat allow wind turbines to talk to each other
p175
aVand adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way,
p176
aVdepending on how the wind is blowing,
p177
aVcan now produce electricity at a cost
p178
aVof less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.
p179
aVTen years ago, that cost was 30 cents,
p180
aVsix times as much.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe list goes on, and it will grow fast,
p183
aVbecause industrial data are now growing exponentially.
p184
aVBy 2020, they will account for over 50 percent
p185
aVof all digital information.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut this is not just about data, so let me switch gears
p188
aVand tell you how this is impacting already
p189
aVthe jobs we do every day,
p190
aVbecause this new wave of innovation
p191
aVis bringing about new tools and applications
p192
aVthat will allow us to collaborate
p193
aVin a smarter and faster way,
p194
aVmaking our jobs not just more efficient
p195
aVbut more rewarding.
p196
aVImagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm
p197
aVwith a handheld device telling her
p198
aVwhich turbines need servicing.
p199
aVShe already has all the spare parts,
p200
aVbecause the problems were diagnosed in advanced.
p201
aVAnd if she faces an unexpected issue,
p202
aVthe same handheld device will allow her to
p203
aVcommunicate with colleagues at the service center,
p204
aVlet them see what she sees,
p205
aVtransmit data that they can run through diagnostics,
p206
aVand they can stream videos that will guide her,
p207
aVstep by step, through whatever complex procedure
p208
aVis needed to get the machines back up and running.
p209
aVAnd their interaction gets documented
p210
aVand stored in a searchable database.
p211
aa(lp212
VLet's stop and think about this for a minute,
p213
aVbecause this is a very important point.
p214
aVThis new wave of innovation is fundamentally
p215
aVchanging the way we work.
p216
aVAnd I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.
p217
aVUnemployment is already high,
p218
aVand there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs.
p219
aVAnd innovation is disruptive.
p220
aVBut let me stress two things here.
p221
aVFirst, we've already lived through
p222
aVmechanization of agriculture, automation of industry,
p223
aVand employment has gone up,
p224
aVbecause innovation is fundamentally about growth.
p225
aVIt makes products more affordable.
p226
aVIt creates new demand, new jobs.
p227
aVSecond, there is a concern that in the future,
p228
aVthere will only be room for engineers,
p229
aVdata scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.
p230
aVAnd believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.
p231
aVBut think about it:
p232
aVJust as a child can easily figure out
p233
aVhow to operate an iPad,
p234
aVso a new generation of mobile and intuitive
p235
aVindustrial applications will make life easier
p236
aVfor workers of all skill levels.
p237
aVThe worker of the future will be more like Iron Man
p238
aVthan the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times."
p239
aVAnd to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:
p240
aVmechanical digital engineers who understand
p241
aVboth the machines and the data;
p242
aVmanagers who understand their industry
p243
aVand the analytics and can reorganize the business
p244
aVto take full advantage of the technology.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut now let's take a step back.
p247
aVLet's look at the big picture.
p248
aVThere are people who argue that today's innovation
p249
aVis all about social media and silly games,
p250
aVwith nowhere near the transformational power
p251
aVof the Industrial Revolution.
p252
aVThey say that all the growth-enhancing innovations
p253
aVare behind us.
p254
aVAnd every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that
p255
aVeven back in the Stone Age,
p256
aVthere must have been a group of cavemen
p257
aVsitting around a fire one day
p258
aVlooking very grumpy,
p259
aVand looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen
p260
aVrolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,
p261
aVand saying to each other,
p262
aV"Yeah, this wheel thing,
p263
aVcool toy, sure, but compared to fire,
p264
aVit will have no impact.
p265
aVThe big discoveries are all behind us."
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VThis technological revolution
p269
aVis as inspiring and transformational
p270
aVas anything we have ever seen.
p271
aVHuman creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward.
p272
aVThey've created jobs.
p273
aVThey've raised living standards.
p274
aVThey've made our lives
p275
aVhealthier and more rewarding.
p276
aVAnd the new wave of innovation
p277
aVwhich is beginning to sweep through industry
p278
aVis no different.
p279
aVIn the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet
p280
aVcould raise average income by 25 to 40 percent
p281
aVover the next 15 years,
p282
aVboosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time,
p283
aVand adding between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP.
p284
aVThat is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.
p285
aa(lp286
VBut this is not a foregone conclusion.
p287
aVWe are just at the beginning of this transformation,
p288
aVand there will be barriers to break,
p289
aVobstacles to overcome.
p290
aVWe will need to invest in the new technologies.
p291
aVWe will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices.
p292
aVWe will need a robust cybersecurity approach
p293
aVthat protects sensitive information and intellectual property
p294
aVand safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.
p295
aVAnd the education system will need to evolve
p296
aVto ensure students are equipped with the right skills.
p297
aVIt's not going to be easy,
p298
aVbut it is going to be worth it.
p299
aVThe economic challenges facing us are hard,
p300
aVbut when I walk the factory floor,
p301
aVand I see how humans and brilliant machines
p302
aVare becoming interconnected,
p303
aVand I see the difference this makes
p304
aVin a hospital, in an airport,
p305
aVin a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,
p306
aVI'm enthusiastic.
p307
aVThis new technological revolution is upon us.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo think about the future \u2014 it will be here soon enough.
p310
