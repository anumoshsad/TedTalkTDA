VWe're going to talk \u2014 my \u2014 a new lecture, just
p4
aVfor TED \u2014 and I'm going show you some illusions
p5
aVthat we've created for TED, and I'm going to try
p6
aVto relate this to happiness. What I was thinking
p7
aVabout with happiness is, what gives happiness \u2014
p8
aVor happiness, which I equate with joy in my
p9
aVparticular area, and I think there's something very
p10
aVfundamental. And I was thinking about this. And
p11
aVit's in terms of both illusions and movies that we
p12
aVgo see and jokes and magic shows is that there's
p13
aVsomething about these things where our
p14
aVexpectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
p15
aVway. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected
p16
aVtwist \u2014 something that you didn't expect \u2014 and
p17
aVyou find a joyful experience. You look at those
p18
aVsort of illusions in my book and it's not as what
p19
aVyou'd expect. And there's something joyful about
p20
aVit. And it's the same thing with jokes and all
p21
aVthese sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try
p22
aVand do in my lecture is go a little bit further
p23
aVand see if I can violate your expectations in a
p24
aVpleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that
p25
aVare violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try
p26
aVto do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,
p27
aVso I can make the audience here happy.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo I'm going to show you some ways that we can
p30
aVviolate your expectations. First of all, I want to
p31
aVshow you the particular illusion here. I want you
p32
aVfirst of all when it pops up on the screen to
p33
aVnotice that the two holes are perpendicular to
p34
aVeach other. These are all perceptual tricks. These
p35
aVare real objects that I'm going to show you. Now
p36
aVI'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
p37
aVthe film here so you can get a very interesting
p38
aVexperience. I want you to see how this illusion is
p39
aVconstructed, and it's going to rotate so you see
p40
aVthat it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates
p41
aVback, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
p42
aVWatch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very
p43
aVbright audience, all right? See if you can stop it
p44
aVfrom happening, even though you know 100 percent it's
p45
aVtrue that \u2014 bam! You can't undo it. What does
p46
aVthat tell you about yourselves? We're going to do
p47
aVit again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop
p48
aVit from happening. No. It's difficult.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd we can violate your expectations in a whole
p51
aVvariety of ways about representation, about shape,
p52
aVabout color and so forth and it's very primal. And
p53
aVit's an interesting question to ponder, why these
p54
aVthings \u2014 we find these things joyful. Why would
p55
aVwe find them joyful? So, here's something that
p56
aVLionel did a while ago. I like these sort of
p57
aVlittle things like this.
p58
aa(lp59
VAgain, this is not an optical trick. This is what
p60
aVyou would see. In other words, it's not a camera
p61
aVcut. It's a perceptual trick.
p62
aVOK. We can violate your expectations about
p63
aVshape.
p64
aVWe can violate your expectations on representation
p65
aV\u2014 what an image represents. What do you see here?
p66
aVHow many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand
p67
aVif you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised
p68
aVtheir hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,
p69
aVgo talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the
p70
aVbest example of priming by experience that I know.
p71
aVIf you are a child under the age of 10 who
p72
aVhaven't been ruined yet, you will look at this
p73
aVimage and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults
p74
aVhere are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"
p75
aVBut in fact, if you reversed the figure ground \u2014
p76
aVin other words, the dark areas here \u2014 I forgot to
p77
aVask for a pointer \u2014 but if you reverse it, you'll
p78
aVsee a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,
p79
aVif you're also a student at CalTech \u2014 they also
p80
aVtend to just see the dolphins. It's based on
p81
aVexperience.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, something like this can be used because this
p84
aVis after all talk about design, too. This was
p85
aVdone by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got
p86
aVaway with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at
p87
aVthis ad for beer, all those people are in sort of
p88
aVprovocative positions. But they got it passed, and
p89
aVactually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do
p90
aVthese things.
p91
aVRemember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did
p92
aVwhen the Florida ballot was going around. You
p93
aVknow, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for
p94
aVBush; count 'em again ...
p95
aa(lp96
VYou can violate your expectations about
p97
aVexperience. Here is an outside water fountain that
p98
aVI created with some friends of mine, but you can
p99
aVstop the water in drops and \u2014 actually make all
p100
aVthe drops levitate. This is something we're
p101
aVbuilding for, you know, amusement parks and that
p102
aVkind of stuff.
p103
aVNow let's take a static image. Can you see this?
p104
aVDo you see the middle section moving down and the
p105
aVouter sections moving up? It's completely static.
p106
aVIt's a static image. How many people see this
p107
aVillusion? It's completely static.
p108
aVRight. Now, when \u2014 it's interesting that when we
p109
aVlook at an image we see, you know, color, depth,
p110
aVtexture. And you can look at this whole scene and
p111
aVanalyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than
p112
aVthe wall and so forth. But the whole thing is
p113
aVactually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
p114
aVAnd it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people
p115
aVgot irritated when they tried to talk to the
p116
aVwoman and she wouldn't respond.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, you can make design mistakes. Like this
p119
aVbuilding in New York. So that when you see it from
p120
aVthis side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,
p121
aVand when you walk around to the other side it
p122
aVlooks like the balconies go down. So there are
p123
aVcases where you have mistakes in design that
p124
aVincorporate illusions.
p125
aVOr, you take this particular un-retouched
p126
aVphotograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot
p127
aVof emails from people who say, "Is there any
p128
aVperceptual difference between males and females?"
p129
aVAnd I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate
p130
aVthrough the world just as well as males can \u2014 and
p131
aVwhy wouldn't they? However, this is the one
p132
aVillusion that women can consistently do better
p133
aVthan males: in matching which head because they
p134
aVrely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.
p135
aa(lp136
VOkay, now getting to a part \u2014 I want to show
p137
aVdesign in illusions. I believe that the first
p138
aVexample of illusions being used purposely was by
p139
aVda Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So
p140
aVthat when you saw from one little angle was like
p141
aVthis. And this little technique got popular in the
p142
aV16th century and the 17th century to disguise
p143
aVhidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
p144
aVsee it from one little point of view like this.
p145
aVBut these are early incorporations of illusions
p146
aVbrought to \u2014 sort of high point with Hans
p147
aVHolbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked
p148
aVfor Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you
p149
aVcould walk down from the stair and you can see
p150
aVthis hidden skull.
p151
aa(lp152
VAll right, now I'm going to show you some
p153
aVdesigners who work with illusions to give that
p154
aVelement of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott
p155
aVKim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions
p156
aVfor TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one
p157
aVhere on TED and happiness.
p158
aVOK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is
p159
aVgoing to be a delightful talk and he has some of
p160
aVhis really fantastic machines outside. And so, we
p161
aV\u2014 Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur
p162
aVGanson.
p163
aa(lp164
VWell, there's analog and digital. Thought that
p165
aVwas appropriate here.
p166
aVAnd figure goes to ground.
p167
aVAnd for the musicians.
p168
aVAnd of course, since happiness \u2014 we want "joy to the
p169
aVworld."
p170
aVNow, another great designer \u2014 he's very well
p171
aVknown in Japan \u2014 Shigeo Fukuda. And he just
p172
aVbuilds some fantastic things. This is simply
p173
aVamazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view
p174
aVit from one particular angle, you see its
p175
aVreflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.
p176
aVPianist transforms to violinist.
p177
aVThis is really wild. This assemblage of forks,
p178
aVknives and spoons and various cutlery, welded
p179
aVtogether. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn
p180
aVsomething in the sort of thing that I do, which
p181
aVis there are people out there with a lot of time
p182
aVon their hands.
p183
aa(lp184
VKen Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like
p185
aVcreating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells \u2014
p186
aVun-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging
p187
aVthem. He did Einstein out of dice because, after
p188
aVall, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with
p189
aVthe universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched
p190
aVkeyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John
p191
aVCederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil
p192
aVcabinets.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running
p195
aV[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've
p196
aVcreated, some new type of illusions. I've done
p197
aVsomething with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So
p198
aVyou see these kids the same size here, running
p199
aVdown the hall. The two table tops of the same size.
p200
aVThey're looking out two directions at once. You
p201
aVhave a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And
p202
aVthat's something for you to think about, all
p203
aVright? So you see larger pieces fitting in within
p204
aVsmaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which
p205
aVis impossible. You can see the two kids are
p206
aVlooking out simultaneously out of two different
p207
aVdirections at once. Now can you believe these two
p208
aVtable tops are the same size and shape? They are.
p209
aVSo, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,
p210
aVthose two figures are identical in size and shape.
p211
aVAnd it's interesting, by doing this in this sort
p212
aVof rendered fashion, how much stronger the
p213
aVillusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought
p214
aVyou a little joy and happiness, and if you're
p215
aVinterested in seeing more cool effects, see me
p216
aVoutside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.
