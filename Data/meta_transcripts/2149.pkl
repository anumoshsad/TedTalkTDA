VThe shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,
p4
aVin the wake of the police  shooting of Michael Brown,
p5
aVunderscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment,
p6
aVdesigned for the battlefield,
p7
aVare making their way
p8
aVto small-town police departments across the United States.
p9
aVAlthough much tougher to observe,
p10
aVthis same thing is happening  with surveillance equipment.
p11
aa(lp12
VNSA-style mass  surveillance is enabling
p13
aVlocal police departments  to gather vast quantities
p14
aVof sensitive information about each and every one of us
p15
aVin a way that was never previously possible.
p16
aa(lp17
VLocation information can  be very sensitive.
p18
aVIf you drive your car around the United States,
p19
aVit can reveal if you go  to a therapist,
p20
aVattend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,
p21
aVif you go to church  or if you don't go to church.
p22
aVAnd when that  information about you
p23
aVis combined with the same information about everyone else,
p24
aVthe government can gain  a detailed portrait
p25
aVof how private citizens interact.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis information used to be private.
p28
aVThanks to modern technology,
p29
aVthe government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors.
p30
aVAnd local police departments make decisions about who they think you are
p31
aVbased on this information.
p32
aa(lp33
VOne of the key technologies  driving mass location tracking
p34
aVis the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader.
p35
aVIf you haven't seen one,
p36
aVit's probably because you didn't know what to look for \u2014
p37
aVthey're everywhere.
p38
aVMounted on roads or  on police cars,
p39
aVAutomatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car
p40
aVand convert the license plate into machine-readable text
p41
aVso that they can be checked against hot lists
p42
aVof cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut more than that, increasingly,
p45
aVlocal police departments  are keeping records
p46
aVnot just of people wanted for wrongdoing,
p47
aVbut of every plate that  passes them by,
p48
aVresulting in the collection of mass quantities of data
p49
aVabout where Americans have gone.
p50
aVDid you know this was happening?
p51
aa(lp52
VWhen Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department
p53
aVfor information about the plate reader data they had on him,
p54
aVthis is what they got:
p55
aVin addition to the date,  time and location,
p56
aVthe police department had  photographs that captured
p57
aVwhere he was going and  often who he was with.
p58
aVThe second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters
p59
aVgetting out of their car in their own driveway.
p60
aVThe government has  hundreds of photos like this
p61
aVabout Mike going about his daily life.
p62
aVAnd if you drive a car  in the United States,
p63
aVI would bet money  that they have photographs
p64
aVlike this of you going about your daily life.
p65
aa(lp66
VMike hasn't done anything wrong.
p67
aVWhy is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information?
p68
aVThe reason it's happening is because,
p69
aVas the cost of storing this data has plummeted,
p70
aVthe police departments simply hang on to it,
p71
aVjust in case it could be useful someday.
p72
aVThe issue is not just that one police department
p73
aVis gathering this information in isolation
p74
aVor even that multiple police  departments are doing it.
p75
aVAt the same time, the federal government
p76
aVis collecting all of these individual pots of data,
p77
aVand pooling them together  into one vast database
p78
aVwith hundreds of millions of hits,
p79
aVshowing where Americans have traveled.
p80
aVThis document from the  Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,
p81
aVwhich is one of the agencies primarily interested in this,
p82
aVis one of several that reveal  the existence of this database.
p83
aVMeanwhile, in New York City,
p84
aVthe NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers
p85
aVpast mosques in order to figure out who is attending.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States.
p88
aVIn the U.K., the police department
p89
aVput 80-year-old John Kat on a plate reader watch list
p90
aVafter he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations
p91
aVwhere he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees.
p92
aa(lp93
VLicense plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology
p94
aVavailable to law enforcement agents today.
p95
aVThrough a technique known as a cell tower dump,
p96
aVlaw enforcement agents can uncover who was using
p97
aVone or more cell towers at a particular time,
p98
aVa technique which has been known to reveal
p99
aVthe location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people.
p100
aVAlso, using a device known as a StingRay,
p101
aVlaw enforcement agents can send tracking signals
p102
aVinside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there.
p103
aVAnd if they don't know which house to target,
p104
aVthey've been known  to drive this technology
p105
aVaround through whole neighborhoods.
p106
aa(lp107
VJust as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment,
p108
aVso too do police departments across the United States
p109
aVpossess high-tech surveillance gear.
p110
aVJust because you don't see it,
p111
aVdoesn't mean it's not there.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe question is, what should we do about this?
p114
aVI think this poses a serious civil liberties threat.
p115
aVHistory has shown that once the police  have massive quantities of data,
p116
aVtracking the movements of innocent people,
p117
aVit gets abused, maybe for blackmail, maybe for political advantage,
p118
aVor maybe for simple voyeurism.
p119
aa(lp120
VFortunately, there are steps we can take.
p121
aVLocal police departments can  be governed by the city councils,
p122
aVwhich can pass laws requiring the police
p123
aVto dispose of the data  about innocent people
p124
aVwhile allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward.
p125
aVThank you.
