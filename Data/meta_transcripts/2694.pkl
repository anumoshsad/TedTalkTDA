VToday, I want to tell you about a pressing social issue.
p4
aVNow, it's not nuclear arms,
p5
aVit's not immigration,
p6
aVand it's not malaria.
p7
aVI'm here to talk about movies.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, in all seriousness, movies are actually really important.
p10
aVIn film, we can be wildly entertained,
p11
aVand we can also be transported through storytelling.
p12
aVStorytelling is so important.
p13
aVStories tell us what societies value,
p14
aVthey offer us lessons,
p15
aVand they share and preserve our history.
p16
aVStories are amazing.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut stories don't give everyone
p19
aVthe same opportunity to appear within them,
p20
aVparticularly not stories
p21
aVcompartmentalized in the form of American movies.
p22
aVIn film, interestingly enough,
p23
aVfemales are still erased and marginalized
p24
aVin a lot of our stories.
p25
aVAnd I learned this for the first time about 10 years ago
p26
aVwhen I did my first study on gender role in G-rated films.
p27
aVSince then, we've conducted more than 30 investigations.
p28
aVMy team is tired.
p29
aVAnd I've committed my life
p30
aVas researcher and activist
p31
aVto fighting the inclusion crisis
p32
aVin Hollywood.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo today, what I'd like to do is tell you about that crisis.
p35
aVI want to talk about gender inequality in film.
p36
aVI want to tell you how it is perpetuated,
p37
aVand then I'm going to tell you how we're going to fix it.
p38
aa(lp39
VHowever, one caveat before I begin:
p40
aVmy data are really depressing.
p41
aVSo I want to apologize in advance,
p42
aVbecause I'm going to put you all in a really bad mood.
p43
aVBut I'm going to bring it up at the end,
p44
aVand I'm going to present a silver lining
p45
aVto fix this mess that we've been in
p46
aVfor a very, very long time.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo, let's start with the gravity of the situation.
p49
aVEach year, my research team examines the top 100 grossing films
p50
aVin the United States.
p51
aVWhat we do is we look at every speaking or named character on-screen.
p52
aVNow, to count in one of my investigations,
p53
aVall a character has to do is say one word.
p54
aVThis is a very low bar.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VThus far, we've looked at 800 movies,
p59
aVfrom 2007 to 2015,
p60
aVcataloguing every speaking character on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,
p61
aVLGBT and characters with a disability.
p62
aa(lp63
VLet's take a look at really some problematic trends.
p64
aVFirst, females are still noticeably absent on-screen in film.
p65
aVAcross 800 movies and 35,205 speaking characters,
p66
aVless than a third of all roles go to girls and women.
p67
aVLess than a third!
p68
aVThere's been no change from 2007 to 2015,
p69
aVand if you compare our results
p70
aVto a small sample of films from 1946 to 1955,
p71
aVthere's been no change in over a half of a century.
p72
aVOver half of a century!
p73
aVBut we're half of the population.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, if we look at this data intersectionally,
p76
aVwhich has been a focus of today,
p77
aVthe picture becomes even more problematic.
p78
aVAcross the top 100 films of just last year,
p79
aV48 films didn't feature one black or African-American speaking character,
p80
aVnot one.
p81
aV70 films were devoid of Asian or Asian-American speaking characters
p82
aVthat were girls or women.
p83
aVNone.
p84
aVEighty-four films didn't feature one female character that had a disability.
p85
aVAnd 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual or transgender female speaking characters.
p86
aVThis is not underrepresentation.
p87
aVThis is erasure,
p88
aVand I call this the epidemic of invisibility.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, when we move from prevalence to protagonist,
p91
aVthe story is still problematic.
p92
aVOut of a hundred films last year,
p93
aVonly 32 featured a female lead or colead driving the action.
p94
aVOnly three out of a hundred films
p95
aVfeatured an underrepresented female driving the story,
p96
aVand only one diverse woman
p97
aVthat was 45 years of age or older at the time of theatrical release.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow let's look at portrayal.
p100
aVIn addition to the numbers you just saw,
p101
aVfemales are far more likely to be sexualized in film
p102
aVthan their male counterparts.
p103
aVMatter of fact, they're about three times as likely
p104
aVto be shown in sexually revealing clothing,
p105
aVpartially naked,
p106
aVand they're far more likely to be thin.
p107
aVNow, sometimes, in animation, females are so thin
p108
aVthat their waist size approximates the circumference of their upper arm.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VWe like to say that these gals have no room for a womb
p113
aVor any other internal organ.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, all joking aside,
p118
aVtheories suggest, research confirms,
p119
aVexposure to thin ideals and objectifying content
p120
aVcan lead to body dissatisfaction, internalization of the thin ideal
p121
aVand self-objectification among some female viewers.
p122
aVObviously, what we see on-screen
p123
aVand what we see in the world,
p124
aVthey do not match.
p125
aVThey do not match!
p126
aVMatter of fact, if we lived in the screen world,
p127
aVwe would have a population crisis on our hands.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, as soon as I recognized these patterns,
p130
aVI wanted to find out why,
p131
aVand it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on-screen:
p132
aVcontent creator gender and misperceptions of the audience.
p133
aVLet's unpack them really quick.
p134
aa(lp135
VIf you want to change any of the patterns I just talked about,
p136
aVall you have to do is hire female directors.
p137
aVTurns out, the female directors
p138
aVare associated with, in terms of short films and indie films,
p139
aVmore girls and women on-screen,
p140
aVmore stories with women in the center,
p141
aVmore stories with women 40 years of age or older on-screen,
p142
aVwhich I think is good news for this crowd.
p143
aVMore underrepresented \u2014
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSorry.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSorry but not sorry.
p152
aVMore underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity,
p153
aVand most importantly,
p154
aVmore women working behind the camera
p155
aVin key production roles.
p156
aVEasy answer to the problems that we just talked about.
p157
aVOr is it?
p158
aVIt's actually not.
p159
aV800 films, 2007-2015,
p160
aV886 directors.
p161
aVOnly 4.1 percent are women.
p162
aVOnly three are African-American or black,
p163
aVand only one woman was Asian.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo why is it so difficult
p166
aVto have female directors
p167
aVif they're part of the solution?
p168
aVWell, to answer this question,
p169
aVwe conducted a study.
p170
aVWe interviewed dozens of industry insiders
p171
aVand asked them about directors.
p172
aVTurns out, both male and female executives,
p173
aVwhen they think director,
p174
aVthey think male.
p175
aVThey perceive the traits of leadership
p176
aVto be masculine in nature.
p177
aVSo when they're going to hire a director
p178
aVto command a crew, lead a ship,
p179
aVbe a visionary or be General Patton,
p180
aVall the things that we've heard \u2014
p181
aVtheir thoughts and ideations pull male.
p182
aVThe perception of director or a leader
p183
aVis inconsistent with the perception of a woman.
p184
aVThe roles are incongruous,
p185
aVwhich is consistent with a lot of research in the psychological arena.
p186
aa(lp187
VSecond factor contributing to inequality on-screen
p188
aVis misperceptions of the audience.
p189
aVI don't need to tell this crowd:
p190
aV50 percent of the people that go to the box office and buy tickets
p191
aVare girls and women in this country.
p192
aVRight?
p193
aVBut we're not perceived to be a viable or financially lucrative target audience.
p194
aVFurther, there's some misperceptions
p195
aVabout whether females can open a film.
p196
aVOpen a film means that if you place a female at the center,
p197
aVit doesn't have the return on investment
p198
aVthat if you place a male at the center of a story does.
p199
aa(lp200
VThis misperception is actually costly.
p201
aVRight?
p202
aVEspecially in the wake of franchise successes
p203
aVlike "The Hunger Games,"
p204
aV"Pitch Perfect"
p205
aVor that small little indie film, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
p206
aVOur own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character
p207
aVdoesn't play a role in economic success in the United States.
p208
aVBut what does?
p209
aVProduction costs alone
p210
aVor in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country.
p211
aVIt's not the gender of the lead character.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo at this point, we should all be sufficiently depressed.
p214
aVNo change in 50 years,
p215
aVfew female directors working behind the camera
p216
aVand the entertainment industry does not trust us as an audience.
p217
aVWell, I told you there would be a silver lining,
p218
aVand there is.
p219
aVThere are actually simple and tangible solutions
p220
aVto fixing this problem
p221
aVthat involve content creators,
p222
aVexecutives and consumers
p223
aVlike the individuals in this room.
p224
aVLet's talk about a few of them.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe first is what I call "just add five."
p227
aVDid you know if we looked at the top 100 films next year
p228
aVand simply added five female speaking characters on-screen
p229
aVto each of those films,
p230
aVit would create a new norm.
p231
aVIf we were to do this for three contiguous years,
p232
aVwe would be at gender parity
p233
aVfor the first time in over a half of a century.
p234
aVNow, this approach is advantageous for a variety of reasons.
p235
aVOne? It doesn't take away jobs for male actors.
p236
aVHeaven forbid.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VTwo, it's actually cost-effective. It doesn't cost that much.
p241
aVThree, it builds a pipeline for talent.
p242
aVAnd four, it humanizes the production process.
p243
aVWhy? Because it makes sure that there's women on set.
p244
aa(lp245
VSecond solution is for A-list talent.
p246
aVA-listers, as we all know, can make demands in their contracts,
p247
aVparticularly the ones that work on the biggest Hollywood films.
p248
aVWhat if those A-listers
p249
aVsimply added an equity clause or an inclusion rider
p250
aVinto their contract?
p251
aVNow, what does that mean?
p252
aVWell, you probably don't know
p253
aVbut the typical feature film
p254
aVhas about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it.
p255
aVI would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters
p256
aVare actually relevant to the story.
p257
aVExcept maybe "Avengers." Right?
p258
aVA few more in "Avengers."
p259
aVThe remaining 30 or so roles,
p260
aVthere's no reason why those minor roles
p261
aVcan't match or reflect the demography
p262
aVof where the story is taking place.
p263
aVAn equity rider by an A-lister in their contract
p264
aVcan stipulate that those roles
p265
aVreflect the world in which we actually live.
p266
aVNow, there's no reason why a network,
p267
aVa studio or a production company
p268
aVcannot adopt the same contractual language
p269
aVin their negotiation processes.
p270
aa(lp271
VThird solution:
p272
aVthis would be for the entertainment industry,
p273
aVHollywood in particular,
p274
aVto adopt the Rooney Rule
p275
aVwhen it comes to hiring practices around directors.
p276
aVNow, in the NFL, the Rooney Rule stipulates
p277
aVthat if a team wants to hire a coach from outside the organization,
p278
aVwhat they have to do is interview an underrepresented candidate.
p279
aVThe exact same principle can apply to Hollywood films.
p280
aVHow?
p281
aVWell, on these top films,
p282
aVexecutives and agents can make sure
p283
aVthat women and people of color are not only on the consideration list,
p284
aVbut they're actually interviewed for the job.
p285
aVNow, one might say,
p286
aVwhy is this important?
p287
aVBecause it exposes or introduces executives to female directors
p288
aVwho otherwise fall prey to exclusionary hiring practices.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe fourth solution
p291
aVis for consumers like me and you.
p292
aVIf we want to see more films by, for and about women,
p293
aVwe have to support them.
p294
aVIt may mean going to the independent theater chain
p295
aVinstead of the multiplex.
p296
aVOr it might mean scrolling down a little further online
p297
aVto find a film by a female director.
p298
aVOr it may be writing a check and funding a film,
p299
aVparticularly by a female director from an underrepresented background.
p300
aVRight?
p301
aVWe need to write, call and email companies
p302
aVthat are making and distributing films,
p303
aVand we need to post on our social media accounts
p304
aVwhen we want to see inclusive representation,
p305
aVwomen on-screen,
p306
aVand most importantly, women behind the camera.
p307
aVWe need to make our voices heard and our dollars count.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, we actually have the ability to change the world on this one.
p310
aVThe US and its content,
p311
aVfilms in particular,
p312
aVhave captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide.
p313
aVWorldwide.
p314
aVSo that means that the film industry has unprecedented access
p315
aVto be able to distribute stories about equality
p316
aVall around the world.
p317
aVImagine what would happen
p318
aVif the film industry aligned its values
p319
aVwith what it shows on-screen.
p320
aVIt could foster inclusion
p321
aVand acceptance for girls and women,
p322
aVpeople of color,
p323
aVthe LGBT community,
p324
aVindividuals with disabilities,
p325
aVand so many more around the world.
p326
aVThe only thing that the film industry has to do is unleash its secret weapon,
p327
aVand that's storytelling.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow, at the beginning of this talk,
p330
aVI said that films \u2014
p331
aVthat they can actually transport us,
p332
aVbut I would like to argue that films, they can transform us.
p333
aVNone of us in this room
p334
aVhave grown up or experienced a storytelling landscape
p335
aVwith fully realized female characters,
p336
aVnone of us,
p337
aVbecause the numbers haven't changed.
p338
aVWhat would happen if the next generation of audiences
p339
aVgrew up with a whole different screen reality?
p340
aVWhat would happen?
p341
aVWell I'm here to tell you today
p342
aVthat it's not only possible to change what we see on-screen
p343
aVbut I am impatient for it to get here.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo let's agree to take action today
p346
aVto eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.
p347
aVAnd let's agree to take action today
p348
aVto agree that US audiences and global viewers
p349
aVdemand and deserve more.
p350
aVAnd let's agree today
p351
aVthat the next generation of viewers and audiences,
p352
aVthat they deserve to see the stories
p353
aVwe were never able to see.
p354
aa(lp355
VThank you.
