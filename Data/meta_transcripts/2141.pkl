VNow, I'm an ethnobotanist.
p4
aVThat's a scientist who  works in the rainforest
p5
aVto document how people use local plants.
p6
aVI've been doing this for a long time,
p7
aVand I want to tell you,
p8
aVthese people know these forests and these medicinal treasures
p9
aVbetter than we do and better than we ever will.
p10
aVBut also, these cultures,
p11
aVthese indigenous cultures,
p12
aVare disappearing much faster than the forests themselves.
p13
aVAnd the greatest and most endangered species
p14
aVin the Amazon Rainforest
p15
aVis not the jaguar,
p16
aVit's not the harpy eagle,
p17
aVit's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow four years ago, I injured my  foot in a climbing accident
p20
aVand I went to the doctor.
p21
aVShe gave me heat,
p22
aVshe gave me cold, aspirin,
p23
aVnarcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,
p24
aVcortisone shots.
p25
aVIt didn't work.
p26
aVSeveral months later,
p27
aVI was in the northeast Amazon,
p28
aVwalked into a village,
p29
aVand the shaman said, "You're limping."
p30
aVAnd I'll never forget this as long as I live.
p31
aVHe looked me in the face and he said,
p32
aV"Take off your shoe and give  me your machete."
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVHe walked over to a palm tree
p35
aVand carved off a fern,
p36
aVthrew it in the fire,
p37
aVapplied it to my foot,
p38
aVthrew it in a pot of water,
p39
aVand had me drink the tea.
p40
aVThe pain disappeared for seven months.
p41
aVWhen it came back, I went to see the shaman again.
p42
aVHe gave me the same treatment,
p43
aVand I've been cured for three years now.
p44
aVWho would you rather be treated by?
p45
aV(Applause)
p46
aVNow, make no mistake \u2014 Western medicine
p47
aVis the most successful system of healing ever devised,
p48
aVbut there's plenty of holes in it.
p49
aVWhere's the cure for breast cancer?
p50
aVWhere's the cure for schizophrenia?
p51
aVWhere's the cure for acid reflux?
p52
aVWhere's the cure for insomnia?
p53
aVThe fact is that these people
p54
aVcan sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
p55
aVcure things we cannot.
p56
aVHere you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon
p57
aVtreating leishmaniasis,
p58
aVa really nasty protozoal disease
p59
aVthat afflicts 12 million people around the world.
p60
aVWestern treatment are injections of antimony.
p61
aVThey're painful, they're expensive,
p62
aVand they're probably not good for your heart;
p63
aVit's a heavy metal.
p64
aVThis man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis is the magic frog.
p67
aVMy colleague, the late great Loren McIntyre,
p68
aVdiscoverer of the source  lake of the Amazon,
p69
aVLaguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,
p70
aVwas lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago.
p71
aVHe was rescued by a group of  isolated Indians called the Matsés.
p72
aVThey beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did.
p73
aVThere, they took out palm leaf baskets.
p74
aVThere, they took out these green monkey frogs \u2014
p75
aVthese are big suckers, they're like this \u2014
p76
aVand they began licking them.
p77
aVIt turns out, they're highly hallucinogenic.
p78
aVMcIntyre wrote about this and it was read  by the editor of High Times magazine.
p79
aVYou see that ethnobotanists have  friends in all sorts of strange cultures.
p80
aVThis guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl,
p81
aVor give it a lick, and  he did, and he wrote,
p82
aV"My blood pressure went through the roof,
p83
aVI lost full control of my bodily functions,
p84
aVI passed out in a heap,
p85
aVI woke up in a hammock six hours later,
p86
aVfelt like God for two days."
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAn Italian chemist read this and said,
p89
aV"I'm not really interested in the theological  aspects of the green monkey frog.
p90
aVWhat's this about the change in blood pressure?"
p91
aVNow, this is an Italian chemist
p92
aVwho's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure
p93
aVbased on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog,
p94
aVand other scientists are looking
p95
aVat a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.
p96
aVHow ironic if these isolated  Indians and their magic frog
p97
aVprove to be one of the cures.
p98
aa(lp99
VHere's an ayahuasca shaman
p100
aVin the northwest Amazon, in the middle of a yage ceremony.
p101
aVI took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer
p102
aVlooking for support for monies to protect their culture.
p103
aVThis fellow looked at the medicine man, and he said,
p104
aV"You didn't go to  medical school, did you?"
p105
aVThe shaman said, "No, I did not."
p106
aVHe said, "Well, then what can you know about healing?"
p107
aVThe shaman looked at him and he said,
p108
aV"You know what? If you have  an infection, go to a doctor.
p109
aVBut many human afflictions are diseases  of the heart, the mind and the spirit.
p110
aVWestern medicine can't  touch those. I cure them."
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VBut all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines.
p114
aVThis is a viper from Brazil,
p115
aVthe venom of which was studied at the Universidade de São Paulo here.
p116
aVIt was later developed into ACE inhibitors.
p117
aVThis is a frontline treatment for hypertension.
p118
aVHypertension causes over 10 percent
p119
aVof all deaths on the planet every day.
p120
aVThis is a $4 billion industry
p121
aVbased on venom from a Brazilian snake,
p122
aVand the Brazilians did not get a nickel.
p123
aVThis is not an acceptable way of doing business.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe rainforest has been called the  greatest expression of life on Earth.
p126
aVThere's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love:
p127
aV"The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask."
p128
aVBut as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing.
p129
aVHere in Brazil, in the Amazon,
p130
aVaround the world.
p131
aVI took this picture from a small plane
p132
aVflying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve
p133
aVin the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here.
p134
aVThe top half of the picture,
p135
aVyou see where the Indians live.
p136
aVThe line through the middle
p137
aVis the eastern border of the reserve.
p138
aVTop half Indians, bottom half white guys.
p139
aVTop half wonder drugs,
p140
aVbottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows.
p141
aVTop half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs,
p142
aVbottom half carbon in the atmosphere
p143
aVwhere it's driving climate change.
p144
aVIn fact, the number two cause
p145
aVof carbon being released into the atmosphere
p146
aVis forest destruction.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut in talking about destruction,
p149
aVit's important to keep in mind
p150
aVthat the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all.
p151
aVIt's a place of beauty and wonder.
p152
aVThe biggest anteater in the world
p153
aVlives in the rain forest,
p154
aVtips the scale at 90 pounds.
p155
aVThe goliath bird-eating spider
p156
aVis the world's largest spider.
p157
aVIt's found in the Amazon as well.
p158
aVThe harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet.
p159
aVAnd the black cayman \u2014
p160
aVthese monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton.
p161
aVThey're known to be man-eaters.
p162
aVThe anaconda, the largest snake,
p163
aVthe capybara, the largest rodent.
p164
aVA specimen from here in Brazil
p165
aVtipped the scale at 201 pounds.
p166
aa(lp167
VLet's visit where these creatures live,
p168
aVthe northeast Amazon,
p169
aVhome to the Akuriyo tribe.
p170
aVUncontacted peoples hold a  mystical and iconic role
p171
aVin our imagination.
p172
aVThese are the people who  know nature best.
p173
aVThese are the people who truly live
p174
aVin total harmony with nature.
p175
aVBy our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive.
p176
aV"They don't know how to make fire,
p177
aVor they didn't when they were first contacted."
p178
aVBut they know the forest far better than we do.
p179
aVThe Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,
p180
aVand other Indians look up to them
p181
aVas being the true masters of the emerald realm.
p182
aVHere you see the face of my friend Pohnay.
p183
aVWhen I was a teenager rocking out
p184
aVto the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans,
p185
aVPohnay was a forest nomad
p186
aVroaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon
p187
aVin a small band, looking for game,
p188
aVlooking for medicinal plants,
p189
aVlooking for a wife,
p190
aVin other small nomadic bands.
p191
aVBut it's people like these
p192
aVthat know things that we don't,
p193
aVand they have lots of  lessons to teach us.
p194
aa(lp195
VHowever, if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon,
p196
aVthere are no indigenous peoples.
p197
aVThis is what you find:
p198
aVrock carvings which indigenous peoples,
p199
aVuncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe.
p200
aVThese cultures that once danced,
p201
aVmade love, sang to the gods,
p202
aVworshipped the forest,
p203
aVall that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here.
p204
aa(lp205
VLet's move to the western Amazon,
p206
aVwhich is really the epicenter of isolated peoples.
p207
aVEach of these dots represents
p208
aVa small, uncontacted tribe,
p209
aVand the big reveal today is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups
p210
aVin the Colombian Amazon alone.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhy are these people isolated?
p213
aVThey know we exist, they know there's an outside world.
p214
aVThis is a form of resistance.
p215
aVThey have chosen to remain isolated,
p216
aVand I think it is their human right to remain so.
p217
aVWhy are these the tribes that hide from man?
p218
aVHere's why.
p219
aVObviously, some of this  was set off in 1492.
p220
aVBut at the turn of the last century
p221
aVwas the rubber trade.
p222
aVThe demand for natural rubber,
p223
aVwhich came from the Amazon,
p224
aVset off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush.
p225
aVRubber for bicycle tires,
p226
aVrubber for automobile tires,
p227
aVrubber for zeppelins.
p228
aVIt was a mad race to get that rubber,
p229
aVand the man on the left, Julio Arana,
p230
aVis one of the true thugs of the story.
p231
aVHis people, his company,
p232
aVand other companies like them
p233
aVkilled, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians
p234
aVlike the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide.
p235
aa(lp236
VEven today, when people come out of the forest,
p237
aVthe story seldom has a happy ending.
p238
aVThese are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '80s.
p239
aVWithin a year, everybody over 40 was dead.
p240
aVAnd remember, these are preliterate societies.
p241
aVThe elders are the libraries.
p242
aVEvery time a shaman dies,
p243
aVit's as if a library has burned down.
p244
aVThey have been forced off their lands.
p245
aVThe drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands,
p246
aVand the Nukaks live as beggars
p247
aVin public parks in eastern Colombia.
p248
aVFrom the Nukak lands, I want to  take you to the southwest,
p249
aVto the most spectacular  landscape in the world:
p250
aVChiribiquete National Park.
p251
aVIt was surrounded by three isolated tribes
p252
aVand thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues,
p253
aVit has now expanded.
p254
aVIt's bigger than the state of Maryland.
p255
aVIt is a treasure trove of botanical diversity.
p256
aVIt was first explored botanically in 1943
p257
aVby my mentor, Richard Schultes,
p258
aVseen here atop the Bell Mountain,
p259
aVthe sacred mountains of the Karijonas.
p260
aVAnd let me show you what it looks like today.
p261
aVFlying over Chiribiquete,
p262
aVrealize that these lost world mountains are still lost.
p263
aVNo scientist has been atop them.
p264
aVIn fact, nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain
p265
aVsince Schultes in '43.
p266
aVAnd we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain
p267
aVjust to the east of the picture.
p268
aVLet me show you what it looks like today.
p269
aa(lp270
VNot only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity,
p271
aVnot only is it home to three isolated tribes,
p272
aVbut it's the greatest treasure trove
p273
aVof pre-Colombian art in the world:
p274
aVover 200,000 paintings.
p275
aVThe Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen
p276
aVdescribed this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast,
p279
aVagain in the Colombian Amazon.
p280
aVRemember, the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England.
p281
aVThe Amazon's a big forest,
p282
aVand Brazil's got a big part of it,
p283
aVbut not all of it.
p284
aVMoving down to these two national parks,
p285
aVCahuinari and Puré
p286
aVin the Colombian Amazon \u2014
p287
aVthat's the Brazilian border to the right \u2014
p288
aVit's home to several groups
p289
aVof isolated and uncontacted peoples.
p290
aVTo the trained eye, you can look at the roofs
p291
aVof these malocas, these longhouses,
p292
aVand see that there's cultural diversity.
p293
aVThese are, in fact, different tribes.
p294
aVAs isolated as these areas are,
p295
aVlet me show you how the  outside world is crowding in.
p296
aVHere we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo.
p297
aVWith the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia,
p298
aVthe outside world is showing up.
p299
aVTo the north, we have illegal gold mining,
p300
aValso from the east, from Brazil.
p301
aVThere's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes.
p302
aVWe see illegal logging coming from the south,
p303
aVand drug runners are trying to move through the park
p304
aVand get into Brazil.
p305
aVThis, in the past, is why you didn't mess
p306
aVwith isolated Indians.
p307
aVAnd if it looks like this picture is out of focus
p308
aVbecause it was taken in a hurry, here's why.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVThis looks like \u2014 (Applause)
p311
aVThis looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon.
p312
aVThis is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.
p313
aVA group called Los Carpinteros.
p314
aVThis is their perception of why you  shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut the world is changing.
p317
aVThese are Mashco-Piros on the Brazil-Peru border
p318
aVwho stumbled out of the jungle
p319
aVbecause they were essentially chased out
p320
aVby drug runners and timber people.
p321
aVAnd in Peru, there's a very nasty business.
p322
aVIt's called human safaris.
p323
aVThey will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture.
p324
aVOf course, when you give them  clothes, when you give them tools,
p325
aVyou also give them diseases.
p326
aVWe call these "inhuman safaris."
p327
aVThese are Indians again  on the Peru border,
p328
aVwho were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries.
p329
aVThey want to get in there and turn them into Christians.
p330
aVWe know how that turns out.
p331
aa(lp332
VWhat's to be done?
p333
aVIntroduce technology to the contacted tribes,
p334
aVnot the uncontacted tribes,
p335
aVin a culturally sensitive way.
p336
aVThis is the perfect marriage of  ancient shamanic wisdom
p337
aVand 21st century technology.
p338
aVWe've done this now with over 30 tribes,
p339
aVmapped, managed and increased protection
p340
aVof over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest.
p341
aV(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VSo this allows the Indians to take control
p344
aVof their environmental and cultural destiny.
p345
aVThey also then set up guard houses
p346
aVto keep outsiders out.
p347
aVThese are Indians, trained as indigenous park rangers,
p348
aVpatrolling the borders
p349
aVand keeping the outside world at bay.
p350
aVThis is a picture of actual contact.
p351
aVThese are Chitonahua Indians
p352
aVon the Brazil-Peru border.
p353
aVThey've come out of the jungle
p354
aVasking for help.
p355
aVThey were shot at,
p356
aVtheir malocas, their  longhouses, were burned.
p357
aVSome of them were massacred.
p358
aVUsing automatic weapons to  slaughter uncontacted peoples
p359
aVis the single most despicable and  disgusting human rights abuse
p360
aVon our planet today, and it has to stop.
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VBut let me conclude by saying,
p364
aVthis work can be spiritually rewarding,
p365
aVbut it's difficult and it can be dangerous.
p366
aVTwo colleagues of mine passed away recently
p367
aVin the crash of a small plane.
p368
aVThey were serving the forest
p369
aVto protect those uncontacted tribes.
p370
aVSo the question is, in conclusion,
p371
aVis what the future holds.
p372
aVThese are the Uray people in Brazil.
p373
aVWhat does the future hold for them,
p374
aVand what does the future hold for us?
p375
aVLet's think differently.
p376
aVLet's make a better world.
p377
aVIf the climate's going to change,
p378
aVlet's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse.
p379
aVLet's live on a planet
p380
aVfull of luxuriant vegetation,
p381
aVin which isolated peoples
p382
aVcan remain in isolation,
p383
aVcan maintain that mystery
p384
aVand that knowledge
p385
aVif they so choose.
p386
aVLet's live in a world
p387
aVwhere the shamans live in these forests
p388
aVand heal themselves and us
p389
aVwith their mystical plants
p390
aVand their sacred frogs.
