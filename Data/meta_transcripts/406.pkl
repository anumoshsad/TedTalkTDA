VI went to Spain a few months ago
p4
aVand I had the best foie gras of my life.
p5
aVThe best culinary experience of my life.
p6
aVBecause what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.
p7
aVRidiculous, right?
p8
aVFoie gras and the future of cooking.
p9
aVThere's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?
p10
aVI mean, it's crucified.
p11
aVIt was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
p12
aVIt's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.
p13
aVIt's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,
p14
aVyou risk being attacked.
p15
aVReally, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm not saying that there's not a rationale
p18
aVfor being opposed to foie gras.
p19
aVThe reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.
p20
aVBasically you take a goose or a duck
p21
aVand you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.
p22
aVMore grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.
p23
aVIts liver expands by eight times.
p24
aVSuffice to say it's like \u2014 it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVI mean, I love the stuff.
p29
aVIt is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.
p30
aVIt makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.
p31
aVCan we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?
p32
aVYes, sure.
p33
aVYou can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVNot a lot of people are doing it.
p36
aVAnd for good reason.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,
p40
aVEduardo Sousa.
p41
aVEduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.
p42
aVNatural foie gras.
p43
aVWhat's natural about foie gras?
p44
aVTo take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,
p45
aVgeese and ducks gorge on food
p46
aVto prepare for the harsh realities of winter.
p47
aVAnd the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land
p48
aVand eat what they want.
p49
aVSo no gavage, no force feeding,
p50
aVno factory-like conditions, no cruelty.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd it's shockingly not a new idea.
p53
aVHis great-granddad started \u2014 Patería de Sousa \u2014 in 1812.
p54
aVAnd they've been doing it quietly ever since.
p55
aVThat is until last year,
p56
aVwhen Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,
p57
aVthe coveted French gastronomic prize.
p58
aVIt's like the Olympics of food products.
p59
aVHe placed first for his foie gras.
p60
aVBig, big problem.
p61
aVAs he said to me, that really pissed the French off.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVHe said it sort of gleefully.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt was all over the papers.
p66
aVI read about it. It was in Le Monde.
p67
aV"Spanish chef accused ... " \u2014 and the French accused him.
p68
aV"Spanish chef accused of cheating."
p69
aVThey accused him of paying off the judges.
p70
aVThey implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.
p71
aVHuh, amazing.
p72
aVA huge scandal for a few weeks.
p73
aVCouldn't find a shred of evidence.
p74
aVNow, look at the guy.
p75
aVHe doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges
p76
aVfor his foie gras.
p77
aVSo that died down, and very soon afterward,
p78
aVnew controversy.
p79
aVHe shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.
p80
aVIt's not foie gras because it's not gavage.
p81
aVThere's no force feeding.
p82
aVSo by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.
p83
aa(lp84
VAs funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it \u2014
p85
aVactually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,
p86
aVI would have said, "That's kind of true."
p87
aVYou know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,
p88
aVand that's what you get when you want foie gras.
p89
aVThat is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,
p90
aV50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.
p91
aVI saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex
p92
aVand then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,
p93
aVis utterly simple.
p94
aVAnd he said to me, really from the first moment,
p95
aVmy life's work is to give the geese what they want.
p96
aVHe repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.
p97
aVI'm just here to give the geese what they want.
p98
aVActually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone
p99
aVtaking pictures of them
p100
aVlike his children in the grass.
p101
aVAmazing.
p102
aVHe's really just in love with \u2014 he's at one with \u2014
p103
aVhe's the goose whisperer.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,
p107
aVlike I'm speaking to you now, right,
p108
aVbut sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,
p109
aVbecause the more I got to know him and his system,
p110
aVthe more exciting this whole idea became.
p111
aVHe kept going like this to me.
p112
aVAnd I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?
p113
aVI'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,
p114
aVso you know, I slowed down.
p115
aVAnd finally, by the end of the day I was like,
p116
aVEd-uar-do, you know like this?
p117
aVBut he was still going like this.
p118
aVI figured it out.
p119
aVI was speaking too loudly.
p120
aVSo I hushed my voice.
p121
aVI kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator
p122
aVin kind of a half whisper.
p123
aVAnd he stopped doing this.
p124
aVAnd amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around \u2014
p125
aV"Get the hell away from this kid!" \u2014
p126
aVwhen I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.
p127
aVRight up to us, like right up to here.
p128
aVRight along the fence line.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd fence line was amazing in itself.
p131
aVThe fence \u2014 like this conception of fence that we have
p132
aVit's totally backward with him.
p133
aVThe electricity on this fiberglass fence
p134
aVis only on the outside.
p135
aVHe rewired it. He invented it.
p136
aVI've never seen it. Have you?
p137
aVYou fence in animals. You electrify the inside.
p138
aVHe doesn't.
p139
aVHe electrifies only the outside.
p140
aVWhy?
p141
aVBecause he said to me that he felt like the geese \u2014
p142
aVand he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this \u2014
p143
aVthe geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.
p144
aVEven though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden
p145
aVwith figs and everything else.
p146
aVHe felt like they felt manipulated.
p147
aVSo he got rid of the electricity,
p148
aVhe got rid of current on the inside
p149
aVand kept it on the outside,
p150
aVso it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, what happened?
p153
aVThey ate, and he showed me on a chart,
p154
aVhow they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.
p155
aVThe landscape is incredible.
p156
aVI mean, his farm is incredible.
p157
aVIt really is the Garden of Eden.
p158
aVThere's figs and everything else there for the taking.
p159
aVAnd the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area \u2014
p160
aVwhat does Extremadura mean?
p161
aVExtra hard land, right?
p162
aVExtra difficult. Extra hard.
p163
aVBut over four generations, he and his family
p164
aVhave literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.
p165
aVUpgrades the life for these geese.
p166
aVAnd they are allowed to take whatever they want.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnother irony, the double irony
p169
aVis that on the figs and the olives,
p170
aVEduardo can make more money selling those
p171
aVthan he can on the foie gras.
p172
aVHe doesn't care.
p173
aVHe lets them take what they want and he says,
p174
aV"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."
p175
aVThe other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.
p176
aVPart of the income for his farm.
p177
aVA big part of his income for his farm.
p178
aVBut he never controls it.
p179
aVThey get what they want,
p180
aVthey leave the rest for me and I sell it.
p181
aa(lp182
VHis biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,
p183
aVwhich demands these days bright yellow foie gras.
p184
aVThat's how I've been trained.
p185
aVYou want to look and see what good foie gras is,
p186
aVit's got to be bright yellow.
p187
aVIt's the indication that it's the best foie gras.
p188
aVWell, because he doesn't force feed,
p189
aVbecause he doesn't gavage tons of corn,
p190
aVhis livers were pretty grey.
p191
aVOr they were.
p192
aVBut he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.
p193
aVThe Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.
p194
aVHe let it go to seed, he took the seeds,
p195
aVhe planted it on his 30 acres, all around.
p196
aVAnd the geese love the Lupin bush.
p197
aVNot for the bush, but for the seeds.
p198
aVAnd when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.
p199
aVRadioactive yellow.
p200
aVBright yellow.
p201
aVOf the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,
p205
aVis this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?
p206
aVIs he like, you know \u2014 because he seemed to have an answer for everything,
p207
aVand it was always nature.
p208
aVIt was never him.
p209
aVAnd I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,
p210
aVweirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.
p211
aVBecause, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?
p212
aVBut he deflected everything away from his ingenuity
p213
aVinto working with his landscape.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,
p216
aVbut increasingly, eating up his every word.
p217
aVAnd we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.
p218
aVAnd he grabs my arm and the translator's,
p219
aVand ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."
p220
aV"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.
p221
aV"Shush, watch this."
p222
aVAnd this squadron of geese come over.
p223
aV[Clapping]
p224
aVAnd they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.
p225
aVAnd like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us
p226
aVthey're called back \u2014 and they're called back and back and back.
p227
aVAnd then they circle around.
p228
aVAnd his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.
p229
aV[Clapping]
p230
aVAnd the wild geese are calling down.
p231
aV[Clapping]
p232
aVAnd it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle
p233
aVand they land.
p234
aVAnd I'm just saying, "No way."
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVNo way.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,
p239
aVand I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese
p240
aVto say come for a visit?"
p241
aVAnd he says, "No, no, no.
p242
aVThey've come to stay."
p243
aVThey've come to stay?
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVIt's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?
p246
aVI said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?
p247
aVTo fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"
p248
aVHe said, "No, no, no.
p249
aVTheir DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.
p250
aVTo happiness.
p251
aVThey find it here.
p252
aVThey don't need anything more."
p253
aVThey stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,
p254
aVand his flock continues.
p255
aVThink about that for a minute.
p256
aVIt's brilliant, right?
p257
aVImagine \u2014 I don't know, imagine a hog farm
p258
aVin, like, North Carolina,
p259
aVand a wild pig comes upon a factory farm
p260
aVand decides to stay.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VSo how did it taste?
p264
aVI finally got to taste it before I left.
p265
aVHe took me to his neighborhood restaurant
p266
aVand he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.
p267
aVIt was incredible.
p268
aVAnd the problem with saying that, of course, is that
p269
aVyou know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.
p270
aVAnd I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.
p271
aVI was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,
p272
aVhe could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,
p273
aVthis guy's a genius, you know?
p274
aVI'm really in love with him at this point.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut it truly was the best foie gras of my life.
p277
aVSo much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.
p278
aVI'd had something that was called foie gras.
p279
aVBut this was transformative. Really transformative.
p280
aVAnd I say to you, I might not stick to this,
p281
aVbut I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again
p282
aVbecause of that taste experience with Eduardo.
p283
aVIt was sweet, it was unctuous.
p284
aVIt had all the qualities of foie gras,
p285
aVbut its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.
p288
aVAnd I kept \u2014 I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.
p289
aVI was sure of it.
p290
aVAnd I'm not like some super taster, you know?
p291
aVBut I can taste things.
p292
aVThere's 100 percent star anise in there.
p293
aVAnd he says, "No."
p294
aVAnd I ended up like going down the spices,
p295
aVand finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,
p296
aVthinking he's salted and peppered his liver.
p297
aVBut no.
p298
aVHe takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,
p299
aVhe sticks them in this jar
p300
aVand he confits it.
p301
aVNo salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.
p302
aVWhat?
p303
aa(lp304
VWe went back out for the final tour of the farm,
p305
aVand he showed me the wild pepper plants
p306
aVand the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.
p307
aVHe doesn't need salt and pepper.
p308
aVAnd he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors
p309
aVthat his geese love to gorge on.
p310
aVI turned to him at the end of the meal,
p311
aVand it's a question I asked several times,
p312
aVand he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,
p313
aVbut I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,
p314
aVsome of the greatest chefs in the world are \u2014
p315
aVFerran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.
p316
aVHow come you don't give him this?
p317
aVHow come no one's really heard of you?"
p318
aVAnd it may be because of the wine,
p319
aVor it may be because of my excitement,
p320
aVhe answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVAnd he was right.
p323
aVHe was right.
p324
aa(lp325
VChefs take foie gras and they make it their own.
p326
aVThey create a dish
p327
aVwhere all the vectors point at us.
p328
aVWith Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.
p329
aVAnd as he said, I think fittingly,
p330
aVit's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.
p331
aVSimple.
p332
aVI flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book
p333
aVand I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.
p334
aVI really was moved.
p335
aVAnd in the corner of one of these \u2014 one of my notes,
p336
aVis this note that says, when asked,
p337
aVwhat do you think of conventional foie gras?
p338
aVWhat do you think of foie gras that
p339
aV99.99999 percent of the world eats?
p340
aVHe said, "I think it's an insult to history."
p341
aVAnd I wrote, insult to history.
p342
aVI'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.
p343
aVIt's like, why didn't I follow up on that?
p344
aVWhat the hell does that mean?
p345
aVInsult to history.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo I did some research when I got back,
p348
aVand here's what I found.
p349
aVThe history of foie gras.
p350
aVJews invented foie gras.
p351
aVTrue story.
p352
aVTrue story.
p353
aVBy accident.
p354
aVThey were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.
p355
aVGotten sick of the chicken fat.
p356
aVThey were looking for an alternative.
p357
aVAnd they saw in the fall that there was this natural,
p358
aVbeautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.
p359
aVAnd they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.
p360
aVThe Pharaoh got wind of this \u2014
p361
aVThis is true, right off the Internet.
p362
aVThe Pharaoh got \u2014 (Laughter)
p363
aVI swear to God.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVThe Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.
p366
aVHe tasted it and fell in love with it.
p367
aVHe started demanding it.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.
p370
aVAnd he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.
p371
aVAnd the Jews, fearing for their life,
p372
aVhad to come up with an ingenious idea,
p373
aVor at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.
p374
aVAnd they invented, what? Gavage.
p375
aVThey invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,
p376
aVand they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,
p377
aVand the good stuff they kept for themselves.
p378
aVSupposedly, anyway. I believe that one.
p379
aa(lp380
VThat's the history of foie gras.
p381
aVAnd if you think about it,
p382
aVit's the history of industrial agriculture.
p383
aVIt's the history of what we eat today.
p384
aVMost of what we eat today.
p385
aVMega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,
p386
aVlong-distance travel, food processing.
p387
aVAll of it, our food system.
p388
aVThat's also an insult to history.
p389
aVIt's an insult to the basic laws of nature
p390
aVand of biology.
p391
aVWhether we're talking about beef cattle
p392
aVor we're talking about chickens,
p393
aVor we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,
p394
aVor in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish \u2014
p395
aVwhich wholesale are going out of business.
p396
aa(lp397
VWhatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.
p398
aVIt's rooted in extraction.
p399
aVTake more, sell more, waste more.
p400
aVAnd for the future it won't serve us.
p401
aVJonas Salk has a great quote.
p402
aVHe said, "If all the insects disappeared,
p403
aVlife on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.
p404
aVIf human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."
p405
aa(lp406
VAnd he's right.
p407
aVWe need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.
p408
aVReally new.
p409
aVOne in which we stop treating the planet
p410
aVas if it were some kind of business in liquidation.
p411
aVAnd stop degrading resources under the guise of
p412
aVcheap food.
p413
aVWe can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.
p414
aVFarmers that rely on nature
p415
aVfor solutions, for answers,
p416
aVrather than imposing solutions on nature.
p417
aVListening as Janine Benyus,
p418
aVone of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,
p419
aV"Listening to nature's operating instructions."
p420
aVThat's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.
p421
aVAnd what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,
p422
aVis that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,
p423
aVand for people that care about food and cooking,
p424
aVis that the most ecological choice for food
p425
aVis also the most ethical choice for food.
p426
aVWhether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.
p427
aVAnd it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,
p428
aVbut almost always, the most delicious choice.
p429
aVThat's serendipitous.
p430
aVThank you.
p431
