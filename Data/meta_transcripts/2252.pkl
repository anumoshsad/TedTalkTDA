VWhy do we cheat?
p4
aVAnd why do happy people cheat?
p5
aVAnd when we say "infidelity," what exactly do we mean?
p6
aVIs it a hookup, a love story, paid sex, a chat room,
p7
aVa massage with a happy ending?
p8
aVWhy do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy,
p9
aVbut women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?
p10
aVAnd is an affair always the end of a relationship?
p11
aa(lp12
VFor the past 10 years, I have traveled the globe
p13
aVand worked extensively with hundreds of couples
p14
aVwho have been shattered by infidelity.
p15
aVThere is one simple act of transgression
p16
aVthat can rob a couple of their relationship,
p17
aVtheir happiness and their very identity: an affair.
p18
aVAnd yet, this extremely common act is so poorly understood.
p19
aVSo this talk is for anyone who has ever loved.
p20
aa(lp21
VAdultery has existed since marriage was invented,
p22
aVand so, too, the taboo against it.
p23
aVIn fact, infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy,
p24
aVso much so, that this is the only commandment
p25
aVthat is repeated twice in the Bible:
p26
aVonce for doing it, and once just for thinking about it.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVSo how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden,
p29
aVyet universally practiced?
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, throughout history, men practically had a license to cheat
p32
aVwith little consequence,
p33
aVand supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories
p34
aVthat justified their need to roam,
p35
aVso the double standard is as old as adultery itself.
p36
aVBut who knows what's really going on under the sheets there, right?
p37
aVBecause when it comes to sex,
p38
aVthe pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate,
p39
aVbut the pressure for women is to hide, minimize and deny,
p40
aVwhich isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries
p41
aVwhere women can be killed for straying.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, monogamy used to be one person for life.
p44
aVToday, monogamy is one person at a time.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aV(Applause)
p47
aa(lp48
VI mean, many of you probably have said,
p49
aV"I am monogamous in all my relationships."
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VWe used to marry,
p53
aVand had sex for the first time.
p54
aVBut now we marry,
p55
aVand we stop having sex with others.
p56
aVThe fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love.
p57
aVMen relied on women's fidelity
p58
aVin order to know whose children these are,
p59
aVand who gets the cows when I die.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, everyone wants to know
p62
aVwhat percentage of people cheat.
p63
aVI've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVIt applies to you.
p66
aVBut the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding:
p67
aVsexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps.
p68
aVSo because there is no universally agreed-upon definition
p69
aVof what even constitutes an infidelity,
p70
aVestimates vary widely, from 26 percent to 75 percent.
p71
aVBut on top of it, we are walking contradictions.
p72
aVSo 95 percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong
p73
aVfor our partner to lie about having an affair,
p74
aVbut just about the same amount of us will say
p75
aVthat that's exactly what we would do if we were having one.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, I like this definition of an affair \u2014
p79
aVit brings together the three key elements:
p80
aVa secretive relationship, which is the core structure of an affair;
p81
aVan emotional connection to one degree or another;
p82
aVand a sexual alchemy.
p83
aVAnd alchemy is the key word here,
p84
aVbecause the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving,
p85
aVcan be as powerful and as enchanting
p86
aVas hours of actual lovemaking.
p87
aVAs Marcel Proust said,
p88
aVit's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo it's never been easier to cheat,
p91
aVand it's never been more difficult to keep a secret.
p92
aVAnd never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll.
p93
aVWhen marriage was an economic enterprise,
p94
aVinfidelity threatened our economic security.
p95
aVBut now that marriage is a romantic arrangement,
p96
aVinfidelity threatens our emotional security.
p97
aVIronically, we used to turn to adultery \u2014
p98
aVthat was the space where we sought pure love.
p99
aVBut now that we seek love in marriage,
p100
aVadultery destroys it.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today.
p103
aVWe have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person
p104
aVto fulfill an endless list of needs:
p105
aVto be my greatest lover, my best friend,
p106
aVthe best parent, my trusted confidant,
p107
aVmy emotional companion, my intellectual equal.
p108
aVAnd I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,
p109
aVI'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,
p110
aVI'm the one.
p111
aVAnd infidelity tells me I'm not.
p112
aVIt is the ultimate betrayal.
p113
aVInfidelity shatters the grand ambition of love.
p114
aVBut if throughout history, infidelity has always been painful,
p115
aVtoday it is often traumatic,
p116
aVbecause it threatens our sense of self.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo my patient Fernando, he's plagued.
p119
aVHe goes on: "I thought I knew my life.
p120
aVI thought I knew who you were, who we were as a couple, who I was.
p121
aVNow, I question everything."
p122
aVInfidelity \u2014 a violation of trust, a crisis of identity.
p123
aV"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.
p124
aV"Can I ever trust anyone again?"
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd this is also what my patient Heather is telling me,
p127
aVwhen she's talking to me about her story with Nick.
p128
aVMarried, two kids.
p129
aVNick just left on a business trip,
p130
aVand Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys,
p131
aVwhen she sees a message appear on the screen:
p132
aV"Can't wait to see you."
p133
aVStrange, she thinks, we just saw each other.
p134
aVAnd then another message:
p135
aV"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."
p136
aVAnd Heather realizes
p137
aVthese are not for her.
p138
aVShe also tells me that her father had affairs,
p139
aVbut her mother, she found one little receipt in the pocket,
p140
aVand a little bit of lipstick on the collar.
p141
aVHeather, she goes digging,
p142
aVand she finds hundreds of messages,
p143
aVand photos exchanged and desires expressed.
p144
aVThe vivid details of Nick's two-year affair
p145
aVunfold in front of her in real time,
p146
aVAnd it made me think:
p147
aVAffairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days.
p150
aVBecause of this romantic ideal,
p151
aVwe are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor.
p152
aVBut we also have never been more inclined to stray,
p153
aVand not because we have new desires today,
p154
aVbut because we live in an era
p155
aVwhere we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires,
p156
aVbecause this is the culture where I deserve to be happy.
p157
aVAnd if we used to divorce because we were unhappy,
p158
aVtoday we divorce because we could be happier.
p159
aVAnd if divorce carried all the shame,
p160
aVtoday, choosing to stay when you can leave
p161
aVis the new shame.
p162
aVSo Heather, she can't talk to her friends
p163
aVbecause she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick,
p164
aVand everywhere she turns, she gets the same advice:
p165
aVLeave him. Throw the dog on the curb.
p166
aVAnd if the situation were reversed, Nick would be in the same situation.
p167
aVStaying is the new shame.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo if we can divorce,
p170
aVwhy do we still have affairs?
p171
aVNow, the typical assumption is that if someone cheats,
p172
aVeither there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.
p173
aVBut millions of people can't all be pathological.
p174
aVThe logic goes like this: If you have everything you need at home,
p175
aVthen there is no need to go looking elsewhere,
p176
aVassuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage
p177
aVthat will inoculate us against wanderlust.
p178
aVBut what if passion has a finite shelf life?
p179
aVWhat if there are things that even a good relationship
p180
aVcan never provide?
p181
aVIf even happy people cheat,
p182
aVwhat is it about?
p183
aa(lp184
VThe vast majority of people that I actually work with
p185
aVare not at all chronic philanderers.
p186
aVThey are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs,
p187
aVand at least for their partner.
p188
aVBut they find themselves in a conflict
p189
aVbetween their values and their behavior.
p190
aVThey often are people who have actually been faithful for decades,
p191
aVbut one day they cross a line
p192
aVthat they never thought they would cross,
p193
aVand at the risk of losing everything.
p194
aVBut for a glimmer of what?
p195
aVAffairs are an act of betrayal,
p196
aVand they are also an expression of longing and loss.
p197
aVAt the heart of an affair, you will often find
p198
aVa longing and a yearning for an emotional connection,
p199
aVfor novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity,
p200
aVa wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves
p201
aVor an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.
p202
aa(lp203
VI'm thinking about another patient of mine, Priya,
p204
aVwho is blissfully married,
p205
aVloves her husband,
p206
aVand would never want to hurt the man.
p207
aVBut she also tells me
p208
aVthat she's always done what was expected of her:
p209
aVgood girl, good wife, good mother,
p210
aVtaking care of her immigrant parents.
p211
aVPriya, she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard
p212
aVafter Hurricane Sandy.
p213
aVAnd with his truck and his tattoos, he's quite the opposite of her.
p214
aVBut at 47, Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had.
p215
aVAnd her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another,
p216
aVit isn't always our partner that we are turning away from,
p217
aVbut the person that we have ourselves become.
p218
aVAnd it isn't so much that we're looking for another person,
p219
aVas much as we are looking for another self.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, all over the world,
p222
aVthere is one word that people who have affairs always tell me.
p223
aVThey feel alive.
p224
aVAnd they often will tell me stories of recent losses \u2014
p225
aVof a parent who died,
p226
aVand a friend that went too soon,
p227
aVand bad news at the doctor.
p228
aVDeath and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair,
p229
aVbecause they raise these questions.
p230
aVIs this it? Is there more?
p231
aVAm I going on for another 25 years like this?
p232
aVWill I ever feel that thing again?
p233
aVAnd it has led me to think that perhaps these questions
p234
aVare the ones that propel people to cross the line,
p235
aVand that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness,
p236
aVin an antidote to death.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd contrary to what you may think,
p239
aVaffairs are way less about sex, and a lot more about desire:
p240
aVdesire for attention, desire to feel special,
p241
aVdesire to feel important.
p242
aVAnd the very structure of an affair,
p243
aVthe fact that you can never have your lover,
p244
aVkeeps you wanting.
p245
aVThat in itself is a desire machine,
p246
aVbecause the incompleteness, the ambiguity,
p247
aVkeeps you wanting that which you can't have.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow some of you probably think
p250
aVthat affairs don't happen in open relationships,
p251
aVbut they do.
p252
aVFirst of all, the conversation about monogamy is not the same
p253
aVas the conversation about infidelity.
p254
aVBut the fact is that it seems that even when we have
p255
aVthe freedom to have other sexual partners,
p256
aVwe still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden,
p257
aVthat if we do that which we are not supposed to do,
p258
aVthen we feel like we are really doing what we want to.
p259
aVAnd I've also told quite a few of my patients
p260
aVthat if they could bring into their relationships
p261
aVone tenth of the boldness, the imagination and the verve
p262
aVthat they put into their affairs,
p263
aVthey probably would never need to see me.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VSo how do we heal from an affair?
p267
aVDesire runs deep.
p268
aVBetrayal runs deep.
p269
aVBut it can be healed.
p270
aVAnd some affairs are death knells
p271
aVfor relationships that were already dying on the vine.
p272
aVBut others will jolt us into new possibilities.
p273
aVThe fact is, the majority of couples
p274
aVwho have experienced affairs stay together.
p275
aVBut some of them will merely survive,
p276
aVand others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity.
p277
aVThey'll be able to turn this into a generative experience.
p278
aVAnd I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner,
p279
aVwho will often say,
p280
aV"You think I didn't want more?
p281
aVBut I'm not the one who did it."
p282
aVBut now that the affair is exposed,
p283
aVthey, too, get to claim more,
p284
aVand they no longer have to uphold the status quo
p285
aVthat may not have been working for them that well, either.
p286
aa(lp287
VI've noticed that a lot of couples,
p288
aVin the immediate aftermath of an affair,
p289
aVbecause of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order,
p290
aVwill have depths of conversations with honesty and openness
p291
aVthat they haven't had in decades.
p292
aVAnd, partners who were sexually indifferent
p293
aVfind themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious,
p294
aVthey don't know where it's coming from.
p295
aVSomething about the fear of loss will rekindle desire,
p296
aVand make way for an entirely new kind of truth.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo when an affair is exposed,
p299
aVwhat are some of the specific things that couples can do?
p300
aVWe know from trauma that healing begins
p301
aVwhen the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing.
p302
aVSo for the partner who had the affair,
p303
aVfor Nick,
p304
aVone thing is to end the affair,
p305
aVbut the other is the essential, important act of expressing
p306
aVguilt and remorse for hurting his wife.
p307
aVBut the truth is
p308
aVthat I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs
p309
aVmay feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner,
p310
aVbut they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself.
p311
aVAnd that distinction is important.
p312
aVAnd Nick, he needs to hold vigil for the relationship.
p313
aVHe needs to become, for a while, the protector of the boundaries.
p314
aVIt's his responsibility to bring it up,
p315
aVbecause if he thinks about it,
p316
aVhe can relieve Heather from the obsession,
p317
aVand from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten,
p318
aVand that in itself begins to restore trust.
p319
aa(lp320
VBut for Heather,
p321
aVor deceived partners,
p322
aVit is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth,
p323
aVto surround oneself with love and with friends and activities
p324
aVthat give back joy and meaning and identity.
p325
aVBut even more important,
p326
aVis to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details \u2014
p327
aVWhere were you? Where did you do it?
p328
aVHow often? Is she better than me in bed? \u2014
p329
aVquestions that only inflict more pain,
p330
aVand keep you awake at night.
p331
aVAnd instead, switch to what I call the investigative questions,
p332
aVthe ones that mine the meaning and the motives \u2014
p333
aVWhat did this affair mean for you?
p334
aVWhat were you able to express or experience there
p335
aVthat you could no longer do with me?
p336
aVWhat was it like for you when you came home?
p337
aVWhat is it about us that you value?
p338
aVAre you pleased this is over?
p339
aa(lp340
VEvery affair will redefine a relationship,
p341
aVand every couple will determine
p342
aVwhat the legacy of the affair will be.
p343
aVBut affairs are here to stay, and they're not going away.
p344
aVAnd the dilemmas of love and desire,
p345
aVthey don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad,
p346
aVand victim and perpetrator.
p347
aVBetrayal in a relationship comes in many forms.
p348
aVThere are many ways that we betray our partner:
p349
aVwith contempt, with neglect,
p350
aVwith indifference, with violence.
p351
aVSexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner.
p352
aVIn other words, the victim of an affair
p353
aVis not always the victim of the marriage.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, you've listened to me,
p356
aVand I know what you're thinking:
p357
aVShe has a French accent, she must be pro-affair.
p358
aV(Laughter)
p359
aVSo, you're wrong.
p360
aVI am not French.
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aVAnd I'm not pro-affair.
p364
aVBut because I think that good can come out of an affair,
p365
aVI have often been asked this very strange question:
p366
aVWould I ever recommend it?
p367
aVNow, I would no more recommend you have an affair
p368
aVthan I would recommend you have cancer,
p369
aVand yet we know that people who have been ill
p370
aVoften talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective.
p371
aVThe main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference
p372
aVwhen I said I would talk about infidelity is, for or against?
p373
aVI said, "Yes."
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VI look at affairs from a dual perspective:
p377
aVhurt and betrayal on one side,
p378
aVgrowth and self-discovery on the other \u2014
p379
aVwhat it did to you, and what it meant for me.
p380
aVAnd so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair
p381
aVthat has been revealed,
p382
aVI will often tell them this:
p383
aVToday in the West,
p384
aVmost of us are going to have two or three relationships
p385
aVor marriages,
p386
aVand some of us are going to do it with the same person.
p387
aVYour first marriage is over.
p388
aVWould you like to create a second one together?
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you.
