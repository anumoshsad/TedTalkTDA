VThe entire model of capitalism
p4
aVand the economic model that you and I
p5
aVdid business in,
p6
aVand, in fact, continue to do business in,
p7
aVwas built around what probably Milton Friedman
p8
aVput more succinctly.
p9
aVAnd Adam Smith, of course,  the father of modern economics
p10
aVactually said many, many years ago,
p11
aVthe invisible hand,
p12
aVwhich is, "If you continue to operate
p13
aVin your own self-interest
p14
aVyou will do the best good for society."
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, capitalism has done a lot of good things
p17
aVand I've talked about a lot of good  things that have happened,
p18
aVbut equally, it has not been able to meet up
p19
aVwith some of the challenges that we've seen
p20
aVin society.
p21
aVThe model that at least I was brought up in
p22
aVand a lot of us doing business were brought up in
p23
aVwas one which talked about
p24
aVwhat I call the three G's of growth:
p25
aVgrowth that is consistent,
p26
aVquarter on quarter;
p27
aVgrowth that is competitive,
p28
aVbetter than the other person;
p29
aVand growth that is profitable,
p30
aVso you continue to make
p31
aVmore and more shareholder value.
p32
aVAnd I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough
p33
aVand we have to move from this 3G model
p34
aVto a model of what I call
p35
aVthe fourth G:
p36
aVthe G of growth that is responsible.
p37
aVAnd it is this that has to become
p38
aVa very important part
p39
aVof creating value.
p40
aVOf not just creating economic value
p41
aVbut creating social value.
p42
aVAnd companies that will thrive are those
p43
aVthat will actually embrace the fourth G.
p44
aVAnd the model of 4G is quite simple:
p45
aVCompanies cannot afford  to be just innocent bystanders
p46
aVin what's happening around in society.
p47
aVThey have to begin to play their role
p48
aVin terms of serving the communities
p49
aVwhich actually sustain them.
p50
aVAnd we have to move to a model
p51
aVof an and/and model which is
p52
aVhow do we make money and do good?
p53
aVHow do we make sure
p54
aVthat we have a great business
p55
aVbut we also have a great environment around us?
p56
aVAnd that model
p57
aVis all about doing well and doing good.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut the question is easier said than done.
p60
aVBut how do we actually get that done?
p61
aVAnd I do believe
p62
aVthat the answer to that is going to be leadership.
p63
aVIt is going to be to redefine
p64
aVthe new business models
p65
aVwhich understand
p66
aVthat the only license to operate
p67
aVis to combine these things.
p68
aVAnd for that you need businesses
p69
aVthat can actually define their role
p70
aVin society
p71
aVin terms of a much larger purpose
p72
aVthan the products and brands that they sell.
p73
aVAnd companies that actually define a true north,
p74
aVthings that are nonnegotiable
p75
aVwhether times are good, bad, ugly \u2014
p76
aVdoesn't matter.
p77
aVThere are things that you stand for.
p78
aVValues and purpose are going to be the two
p79
aVdrivers of software
p80
aVthat are going to create
p81
aVthe companies of tomorrow.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd I'm going to now shift
p84
aVto talking a little bit about my own experiences.
p85
aVI joined Unilever in 1976
p86
aVas a management trainee in India.
p87
aVAnd on my first day of work
p88
aVI walked in and my boss tells me,
p89
aV"Do you know why you're here?"
p90
aVI said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."
p91
aVAnd he said,  "No, you're here to change lives."
p92
aVYou're here to change lives.
p93
aVYou know, I thought it was rather facetious.
p94
aVWe are a company that sells soap and soup.
p95
aVWhat are we doing about changing lives?
p96
aVAnd it's then I realized
p97
aVthat simple acts
p98
aVlike selling a bar of soap
p99
aVcan save more lives
p100
aVthan pharmaceutical companies.
p101
aVI don't know how many of you know
p102
aVthat five million children don't reach the age of five
p103
aVbecause of simple infections that can be prevented
p104
aVby an act of washing their hands with soap.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe run the largest
p107
aVhand-washing program
p108
aVin the world.
p109
aVWe are running a program on hygiene and health
p110
aVthat now touches half a billion people.
p111
aVIt's not about selling soap,
p112
aVthere is a larger purpose out there.
p113
aVAnd brands indeed can be
p114
aVat the forefront of social change.
p115
aVAnd the reason for that is,
p116
aVwhen two billion people use your brands
p117
aVthat's the amplifier.
p118
aVSmall actions can make a big difference.
p119
aa(lp120
VTake another example,
p121
aVI was walking around in  one of our villages in India.
p122
aVNow those of you who have done this
p123
aVwill realize that this is no walk in the park.
p124
aVAnd we had this lady
p125
aVwho was one of our small distributors \u2014
p126
aVbeautiful, very, very modest, her home \u2014
p127
aVand she was out there,
p128
aVdressed nicely,
p129
aVher husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind
p130
aVand her sister-in-law behind her.
p131
aVThe social order was changing
p132
aVbecause this lady
p133
aVis part of our Project Shakti
p134
aVthat is actually teaching women
p135
aVhow to do small business
p136
aVand how to carry the message
p137
aVof nutrition and hygiene.
p138
aVWe have 60,000 such women
p139
aVnow in India.
p140
aa(lp141
VIt's not about selling soap,
p142
aVit's about making sure
p143
aVthat in the process of doing so
p144
aVyou can change people's lives.
p145
aVSmall actions, big difference.
p146
aa(lp147
VOur R&D folks
p148
aVare not only working to give us  some fantastic detergents,
p149
aVbut they're working to make sure we use less water.
p150
aVA product that we've just launched recently,
p151
aVOne Rinse product that allows you to save water
p152
aVevery time you wash your clothes.
p153
aVAnd if we can convert all our users to using this,
p154
aVthat's 500 billion liters of water.
p155
aVBy the way, that's equivalent to one month of water
p156
aVfor a whole huge continent.
p157
aVSo just think about it.
p158
aVThere are small actions that  can make a big difference.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd I can go on and on.
p161
aVOur food chain, our brilliant products \u2014
p162
aVand I'm sorry I'm giving you  a word from the sponsors \u2014
p163
aVKnorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.
p164
aVWe are committed to making sure that
p165
aVall our agricultural raw materials
p166
aVare sourced from sustainable sources,
p167
aV100-percent sustainable sources.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe were the first
p170
aVto say we are going to buy all of our palm oil
p171
aVfrom sustainable sources.
p172
aVI don't know how many of you know that palm oil,
p173
aVand not buying it from sustainable sources,
p174
aVcan create deforestation that is responsible
p175
aVfor 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.
p176
aVWe were the first to embrace that,
p177
aVand it's all because we market soap and soup.
p178
aVAnd the point I'm making here
p179
aVis that companies like yours, companies like mine
p180
aVhave to define a purpose
p181
aVwhich embraces responsibility
p182
aVand understands that we have to play our part
p183
aVin the communities in which we operate.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe introduced something called
p186
aVThe Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,
p187
aV"Our purpose is to make  sustainable living commonplace,
p188
aVand we are gong to change the lives
p189
aVof one billion people over 2020."
p190
aVNow the question here is,
p191
aVwhere do we go from here?
p192
aVAnd the answer to that is very simple:
p193
aVWe're not going to change the world alone.
p194
aVThere are plenty of you and plenty of us
p195
aVwho understand this.
p196
aVThe question is,
p197
aVwe need partnerships, we need coalitions
p198
aVand importantly, we need that leadership
p199
aVthat will allow us to take this from here
p200
aVand to be the change
p201
aVthat we want to see around us.
p202
aVThank you very much.
