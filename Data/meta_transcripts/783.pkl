VIf I can leave you with one big idea today,
p4
aVit's that the whole of the data
p5
aVin which we consume
p6
aVis greater that the sum of the parts,
p7
aVand instead of thinking about information overload,
p8
aVwhat I'd like you to think about is how
p9
aVwe can use information so that patterns pop
p10
aVand we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart
p13
aVorganized by age.
p14
aVThis tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.
p15
aVIt's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do
p16
aVis I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths \u2014 say, accidents.
p17
aVAnd, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.
p18
aVThis is because, in the mid-area here,
p19
aVpeople are at their most active,
p20
aVand over here they're at their most frail.
p21
aVWe can step back out again
p22
aVand then reorganize the data by cause of death,
p23
aVseeing that circulatory diseases and cancer
p24
aVare the usual suspects, but not for everyone.
p25
aVIf we go ahead and we filter by age \u2014
p26
aVsay 40 years or less \u2014
p27
aVwe see that accidents are actually
p28
aVthe greatest cause that people have to be worried about.
p29
aVAnd if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo you get the idea
p32
aVthat viewing information, viewing data in this way,
p33
aVis a lot like swimming
p34
aVin a living information info-graphic.
p35
aVAnd if we can do this for raw data,
p36
aVwhy not do it for content as well?
p37
aVSo what we have right here
p38
aVis the cover of every single Sports Illustrated
p39
aVever produced.
p40
aVIt's all here; it's all on the web.
p41
aVYou can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.
p42
aVWith Pivot, you can drill into a decade.
p43
aVYou can drill into a particular year.
p44
aVYou can jump right into a specific issue.
p45
aVSo I'm looking at this; I see the athletes
p46
aVthat have appeared in this issue, the sports.
p47
aVI'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,
p48
aVwhich reveals, for me, all the issues
p49
aVin which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Applause)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,
p54
aVI might think,
p55
aV"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"
p56
aVSo I can step back, and expand on that.
p57
aVAnd I see Greg LeMond now.
p58
aVAnd so you get the idea that when you
p59
aVnavigate over information this way \u2014
p60
aVgoing narrower, broader,
p61
aVbacking in, backing out \u2014
p62
aVyou're not searching, you're not browsing.
p63
aVYou're doing something that's actually a little bit different.
p64
aVIt's in between, and we think it changes
p65
aVthe way information can be used.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit
p68
aVwith something that's a little bit crazy.
p69
aVWhat we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page
p70
aVand we reduced it down to a little summary.
p71
aVSo the summary consists of just a little synopsis
p72
aVand an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.
p73
aVI'm only showing the top 500
p74
aVmost popular Wikipedia pages right here.
p75
aVBut even in this limited view,
p76
aVwe can do a lot of things.
p77
aVRight away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains
p78
aVthat are most popular on Wikipedia.
p79
aVI'm going to go ahead and select government.
p80
aVNow, having selected government,
p81
aVI can now see that the Wikipedia categories
p82
aVthat most frequently correspond to that
p83
aVare Time magazine People of the Year.
p84
aVSo this is really important because this is an insight
p85
aVthat was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.
p86
aVIt's only possible to see that insight
p87
aVwhen you step back and look at all of them.
p88
aa(lp89
VLooking at one of these particular summaries,
p90
aVI can then drill into the concept of
p91
aVTime magazine Person of the Year,
p92
aVbringing up all of them.
p93
aVSo looking at these people,
p94
aVI can see that the majority come from government;
p95
aVsome have come from natural sciences;
p96
aVsome, fewer still, have come from business \u2014
p97
aVthere's my boss \u2014
p98
aVand one has come from music.
p99
aVAnd interestingly enough,
p100
aVBono is also a TED Prize winner.
p101
aVSo we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.
p102
aVSo you see, we're navigating the web for the first time
p103
aVas if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,
p104
aVbut at a higher level of abstraction.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd so I want to show you one other thing
p107
aVthat may catch you a little bit by surprise.
p108
aVI'm just showing the New York Times website here.
p109
aVSo Pivot, this application \u2014
p110
aVI don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,
p111
aVbut you can view web pages with it \u2014
p112
aVand we bring that zoomable technology
p113
aVto every single web page like this.
p114
aVSo I can step back,
p115
aVpop right back into a specific section.
p116
aVNow the reason why this is important is because,
p117
aVby virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,
p118
aVI can look at my entire browsing history
p119
aVin the exact same way.
p120
aVSo I can drill into what I've done
p121
aVover specific time frames.
p122
aVHere, in fact, is the state
p123
aVof all the demo that I just gave.
p124
aVAnd I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.
p125
aVAnd, if I want to step back and look at everything,
p126
aVI can slice and dice my history,
p127
aVperhaps by my search history \u2014
p128
aVhere, I was doing some nepotistic searching,
p129
aVlooking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.
p130
aVAnd from these, I can drill into the web page
p131
aVand just launch them again.
p132
aVIt's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,
p133
aVand in each case it makes the whole greater
p134
aVthan the sum of the parts with the data.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo right now, in this world,
p137
aVwe think about data as being this curse.
p138
aVWe talk about the curse of information overload.
p139
aVWe talk about drowning in data.
p140
aVWhat if we can actually turn that upside down
p141
aVand turn the web upside down,
p142
aVso that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,
p143
aVwe get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,
p144
aVand then being able to see the patterns
p145
aVthat were otherwise hidden?
p146
aVIf we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,
p147
aVwe might actually extract information.
p148
aVAnd, instead of dealing just with information,
p149
aVwe can tease out knowledge.
p150
aVAnd if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo with that, I thank you.
