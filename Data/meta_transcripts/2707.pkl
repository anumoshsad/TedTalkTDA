VWhen I die,
p4
aVI would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals.
p5
aVHaving your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for everyone.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VMaybe you have already had the end-of-life talk with your family
p10
aVand decided on, I don't know, cremation.
p11
aVAnd in the interest of full disclosure,
p12
aVwhat I am proposing for my dead body is not strictly legal at the moment,
p13
aVbut it's not without precedent.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe've been laying out our dead for all of human history;
p16
aVit's call exposure burial.
p17
aVIn fact, it's likely happening right now as we speak.
p18
aVIn the mountainous regions of Tibet,
p19
aVthey practice "sky burial,"
p20
aVa ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures.
p21
aVIn Mumbai, in India, those who follow the Parsi religion
p22
aVput their dead in structures called "Towers of Silence."
p23
aVThese are interesting cultural tidbits,
p24
aVbut they just haven't really been that popular in the Western world \u2014
p25
aVthey're not what you'd expect.
p26
aa(lp27
VIn America, our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming,
p28
aVfollowed by burial at your local cemetery,
p29
aVor, more recently, cremation.
p30
aVI myself, am a recent vegetarian,
p31
aVwhich means I spent the first 30 years or so of my life
p32
aVfrantically inhaling animals \u2014
p33
aVas many as I could get my hands on.
p34
aVWhy, when I die, should they not have their turn with me?
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VAm I not an animal?
p39
aVBiologically speaking, are we not all, in this room, animals?
p40
aVAccepting the fact that we are animals
p41
aVhas some potentially terrifying consequences.
p42
aVIt means accepting that we are doomed to decay and die,
p43
aVjust like any other creature on earth.
p44
aa(lp45
VFor the last nine years, I've worked in the funeral industry,
p46
aVfirst as a crematory operator,
p47
aVthen as a mortician
p48
aVand most recently, as the owner of my own funeral home.
p49
aVAnd I have some good news:
p50
aVif you're looking to avoid the whole "doomed to decay and die" thing:
p51
aVyou will have all the help in the world in that avoidance
p52
aVfrom the funeral industry.
p53
aa(lp54
VIt's a multi-billion-dollar industry,
p55
aVand its economic model is based on the principle
p56
aVof protection, sanitation and beautification of the corpse.
p57
aVWhether they mean to or not,
p58
aVthe funeral industry promotes this idea of human exceptionalism.
p59
aVIt doesn't matter what it takes,
p60
aVhow much it costs,
p61
aVhow bad it is for the environment,
p62
aVwe're going to do it because humans are worth it!
p63
aVIt ignores the fact
p64
aVthat death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair,
p65
aVand that there is beauty in decay \u2014
p66
aVbeauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came.
p67
aVNow, I don't want you to get me wrong \u2014
p68
aVI absolutely understand the importance of ritual,
p69
aVespecially when it comes to the people that we love.
p70
aVBut we have to be able to create and practice this ritual
p71
aVwithout harming the environment,
p72
aVwhich is why we need new options.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo let's return to the idea of protection, sanitation and beautification.
p75
aVWe'll start with a dead body.
p76
aVThe funeral industry will protect your dead body
p77
aVby offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal
p78
aVwith a rubber sealant.
p79
aVAt the cemetery, on the day of burial, that casket will be lowered
p80
aVinto a large concrete or metal vault.
p81
aVWe're wasting all of these resources \u2014 concretes, metal, hardwoods \u2014
p82
aVhiding them in vast underground fortresses.
p83
aVWhen you choose burial at the cemetery,
p84
aVyour dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it.
p85
aVFood for worms
p86
aVyou are not.
p87
aa(lp88
VNext, the industry will sanitize your body through embalming:
p89
aVthe chemical preservation of the dead.
p90
aVThis procedure drains your blood
p91
aVand replaces it with a toxic, cancer-causing formaldehyde.
p92
aVThey say they do this for the public health
p93
aVbecause the dead body can be dangerous,
p94
aVbut the doctors in this room will tell you
p95
aVthat that claim would only apply
p96
aVif the person had died of some wildly infectious disease, like Ebola.
p97
aVEven human decomposition, which, let's be honest,
p98
aVis a little stinky and unpleasant,
p99
aVis perfectly safe.
p100
aVThe bacteria that causes disease is not the same bacteria
p101
aVthat causes decomposition.
p102
aa(lp103
VFinally, the industry will beautify the corpse.
p104
aVThey'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father
p105
aVis not good enough as it is.
p106
aVThey'll put it in makeup.
p107
aVThey'll put it in a suit.
p108
aVThey'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive \u2014
p109
aVjust resting.
p110
aVEmbalming is a cheat code,
p111
aVproviding the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end
p112
aVfor all organic life on this planet.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, if this system of beautification, sanitation, protection
p115
aVdoesn't appeal to you,
p116
aVyou are not alone.
p117
aVThere is a whole wave of people \u2014
p118
aVfuneral directors, designers, environmentalists \u2014
p119
aVtrying to come up with a more eco-friendly way of death.
p120
aVFor these people, death is not necessarily
p121
aVa pristine, makeup, powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.
p122
aVThere's no question
p123
aVthat our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable,
p124
aVwhat with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals.
p125
aVEven cremation,
p126
aVwhich is usually considered the environmentally friendly option,
p127
aVuses, per cremation,
p128
aVthe natural gas equivalent of a 500-mile car trip.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo where do we go from here?
p131
aVLast summer, I was in the mountains of North Carolina,
p132
aVhauling buckets of wood chips in the summer sun.
p133
aVI was at Western Carolina University at their "Body Farm,"
p134
aVmore accurately called a "human decomposition facility."
p135
aVBodies donated to science are brought here,
p136
aVand their decay is studied to benefit the future of forensics.
p137
aVOn this particular day,
p138
aVthere were 12 bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition.
p139
aVSome were skeletonized,
p140
aVone was wearing purple pajamas,
p141
aVone still had blonde facial hair visible.
p142
aVThe forensic aspect is really fascinating,
p143
aVbut not actually why I was there.
p144
aVI was there because a colleague of mine named Katrina Spade
p145
aVis attempting to create a system, not of cremating the dead,
p146
aVbut composting the dead.
p147
aa(lp148
VShe calls the system "Recomposition,"
p149
aVand we've been doing it with cattle and other livestock for years.
p150
aVShe imagines a facility
p151
aVwhere the family could come and lay their dead loved one
p152
aVin a nutrient-rich mixture that would, in four-to-six weeks,
p153
aVreduce the body \u2014 bones and all \u2014 to soil.
p154
aVIn those four-to-six weeks,
p155
aVyour molecules become other molecules;
p156
aVyou literally transform.
p157
aa(lp158
VHow would this fit in with the very recent desire
p159
aVa lot of people seem to have
p160
aVto be buried under a tree,
p161
aVor to become a tree when they die?
p162
aVIn a traditional cremation, the ashes that are left over \u2014
p163
aVinorganic bone fragments \u2014
p164
aVform a thick, chalky layer
p165
aVthat, unless distributed in the soil just right,
p166
aVcan actually hurt or kill the tree.
p167
aVBut if you're recomposed, if you actually become the soil,
p168
aVyou can nourish the tree,
p169
aVand become the post-mortem contributor you've always wanted to be \u2014
p170
aVthat you deserve to be.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo that's one option for the future of cremation.
p173
aVBut what about the future of cemeteries?
p174
aVThere are a lot of people who think we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore
p175
aVbecause we're running out of land.
p176
aVBut what if we reframed it,
p177
aVand the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,
p178
aVbut its potential savior?
p179
aVI'm talking about conservation burial,
p180
aVwhere large swaths of land are purchased by a land trust.
p181
aVThe beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land,
p182
aVit can't be touched, it can't be developed on \u2014
p183
aVhence the term, "conservation burial."
p184
aVIt's the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem \u2014
p185
aV"Hell no, I won't go!
p186
aVNo, really \u2014 I can't. I'm decomposing under here."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VAny money that the family gives to the cemetery
p191
aVwould go back into protecting and managing the land.
p192
aVThere are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense.
p193
aVThe graves are scattered about the property
p194
aVunder elegant mounds,
p195
aVmarked only by a rock or a small metal disk,
p196
aVor sometimes only locatable by GPS.
p197
aVThere's no embalming,
p198
aVno heavy, metal caskets.
p199
aVMy funeral home sells a few caskets
p200
aVmade out of things like woven willow and bamboo,
p201
aVbut honestly, most of our families just choose a simple shroud.
p202
aVThere are none of the big vaults that most cemeteries require
p203
aVjust because it makes it easier for them to landscape.
p204
aVFamilies can come here; they can luxuriate in nature;
p205
aVthey can even plant a tree or a shrub,
p206
aVthough only native plants to the area are allowed.
p207
aVThe dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape.
p208
aa(lp209
VThere's hope in conservation cemeteries.
p210
aVThey offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas.
p211
aVThey offer a chance to reintroduce native plants and animals to a region.
p212
aVThey offer public trails,
p213
aVplaces for spiritual practice,
p214
aVplaces for classes and events \u2014
p215
aVplaces where nature and mourning meet.
p216
aVMost importantly, they offer us, once again,
p217
aVa chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground.
p218
aVThe soil,
p219
aVlet me tell you,
p220
aVhas missed us.
p221
aa(lp222
VI think for a lot of people,
p223
aVthey're starting to get the sense
p224
aVthat our current funeral industry isn't really working for them.
p225
aVFor many of us,
p226
aVbeing sanitized and beautified just doesn't reflect us.
p227
aVIt doesn't reflect what we stood for during our lives.
p228
aVWill changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change?
p229
aVNo.
p230
aVBut it will make bold moves
p231
aVin how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet.
p232
aVIf we can die in a way that is more humble and self-aware,
p233
aVI believe that we stand a chance.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.
