VSo, Ma was trying to explain something to me
p4
aVabout Grandma and when they grew up,
p5
aVbut I couldn't pay attention to her
p6
aVbecause I was five years old, and I was petrified.
p7
aVI had just seen The Green Lady.
p8
aVNow, about a week earlier, I'd watched that movie "Godzilla,"
p9
aVthe one about that huge lizard-like beast storming a major city,
p10
aVand the thought of a green monster coming for me was stuck in my mind.
p11
aVAnd yet there I was, at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,
p12
aVjust staring at her:
p13
aVher horns,
p14
aVher muscles \u2014
p15
aVall of it just frightened me.
p16
aVAnd I didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero.
p17
aVSo I decided to consult the Google of the day \u2014
p18
aV"Ma! Ma!"
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VMy mother explained that The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty
p23
aVand that she was waving immigrants in.
p24
aVNow, the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head
p25
aVwas the fact that, according to Ma,
p26
aVlong before us,
p27
aVThe Green Lady was actually brown,
p28
aVbrown like me,
p29
aVand that she changed colors over the years,
p30
aVmuch like America.
p31
aVNow, the part that really is intriguing about this
p32
aVis that when she changed colors,
p33
aVshe made me think about myself.
p34
aVIt all made sense to me,
p35
aVbecause as a first-generation American,
p36
aVI was surrounded by immigrants.
p37
aVIn fact, within my immediate social circle of the people who support me,
p38
aVwho enrich my life,
p39
aVat least two are foreign-born.
p40
aVMy life as a US citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers,
p41
aVand chances are,
p42
aVso is yours.
p43
aa(lp44
VThere are more than 40 million immigrants in the USA.
p45
aVAccording to census data,
p46
aVa quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign-born parent.
p47
aVI know all these statistics because I study global migration patterns.
p48
aVI'm a journalist, and for the last few years,
p49
aVI've been documenting the lives of US citizens
p50
aVwho've lost people to deportation.
p51
aVAnd the numbers are enormous.
p52
aVFrom 2008 to 2016,
p53
aVmore than three million people were "ordered removed" \u2014
p54
aVthat's the technical term for being deported.
p55
aVThere is an economic, a political, a psychological and an emotional cost
p56
aVto those deportations \u2014
p57
aVthe moments when these circles are broken.
p58
aa(lp59
VI once asked a US soldier,
p60
aV"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd she told me,
p63
aV"Because I'm proud to defend my country."
p64
aa(lp65
VBut I pressed to know \u2014
p66
aV"Really, when you're on base,
p67
aVand you hear bombs exploding in the distance,
p68
aVand you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured,
p69
aVin that moment, when you know you could be next,
p70
aVwhat does 'my country' mean?"
p71
aa(lp72
VShe looked at me.
p73
aV"My country is my wife,
p74
aVmy family,
p75
aVmy friends, my soldiers."
p76
aVWhat she was telling me
p77
aVis that "my country" is a collection of these strong relationships;
p78
aVthese social circles.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhen the social circles are weakened,
p81
aVa country itself is weaker.
p82
aVWe're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy.
p83
aVRather than focusing on individuals,
p84
aVwe should focus on the circles around them,
p85
aVbecause these are the people who are left behind:
p86
aVthe voters, the taxpayers,
p87
aVthe ones who are suffering that loss.
p88
aVAnd it's not just the children of the deported
p89
aVwho are impacted.
p90
aVYou have brothers and sisters who are separated by borders.
p91
aVYou have classmates, teachers, law enforcement officers,
p92
aVtechnologists, scientists, doctors,
p93
aVwho are all scrambling to make sense of new realities
p94
aVwhen their social circles are broken.
p95
aVThese are the real lives behind all these statistics
p96
aVthat dominate discussions about immigration policy.
p97
aVBut we don't often think about them.
p98
aVAnd I'm trying to change that.
p99
aa(lp100
VHere's just one of the real-life stories that I've collected.
p101
aVAnd it still haunts me.
p102
aVI met Ramon and his son in 2016,
p103
aVthe same year both of them were being ordered out of the country.
p104
aVRamon was being deported to Latin America,
p105
aVwhile his son, who was a sergeant in the US military,
p106
aVwas being deployed.
p107
aVDeported ...
p108
aVdeployed.
p109
aVIf you just look at Ramon's case,
p110
aVit wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is.
p111
aVBut consider his son:
p112
aVa US citizen defending a country that's banished his father.
p113
aVThe social circle is what's key here.
p114
aa(lp115
VHere's another example that illustrates those critical bonds.
p116
aVA group of citizens in Philadelphia were concerned about their jobs,
p117
aVbecause the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked
p118
aVwas an undocumented immigrant,
p119
aVand immigration officials had picked him up.
p120
aVThey rallied behind him.
p121
aVAn immigration lawyer argued
p122
aVhe was too important to the local community
p123
aVto be deported.
p124
aVAt the hearing, they even submitted restaurant reviews \u2014
p125
aVrestaurant reviews!
p126
aVIn the end, a judge exercised what's called "judicial discretion"
p127
aVand allowed him to stay in the country,
p128
aVbut only because they considered the social circle.
p129
aa(lp130
VThere are 23 million noncitizens in the USA,
p131
aVaccording to verifiable federal data.
p132
aVAnd that doesn't include the undocumented,
p133
aVbecause numbers for that population are at best complex estimates.
p134
aVLet's just work with what we have.
p135
aVThat's 23 million social circles \u2014
p136
aVabout 100 million individuals
p137
aVwhose lives could be impacted by deportation.
p138
aVAnd the stress of it all is trickling down through the population.
p139
aVA 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents
p140
aVfound that 30 percent of citizens in LA County
p141
aVare stressed about deportation,
p142
aVnot because they themselves could be removed,
p143
aVbut rather, because members of their social circle were at risk.
p144
aa(lp145
VI am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported;
p146
aVdon't confuse me with that.
p147
aVBut what I am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture.
p148
aVIf you are within the sound of my voice,
p149
aVI want you to close your eyes for a moment
p150
aVand examine your own social circle.
p151
aVWho are your foreign-born?
p152
aVWhat would it feel like if the circle were broken?
p153
aa(lp154
VShare your story.
p155
aVI'm building a global archive of first-person accounts
p156
aVand linking them with mapping technology,
p157
aVso that we can see exactly where these circles break,
p158
aVbecause this is not just an American issue.
p159
aVThere are a quarter-billion migrants around the world;
p160
aVpeople living, loving and learning in countries where they were not born.
p161
aVAnd in my career, in my life, I've been one of them:
p162
aVin China, in Africa, in Europe.
p163
aVAnd each time I become one of these foreigners \u2014
p164
aVone of these strange-looking guys in a new land \u2014
p165
aVI can't help but think back to that day
p166
aVwhen I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom
p167
aVall those decades ago,
p168
aVwhen I was scared,
p169
aVand I had just spotted that green lady.
p170
aVAnd I guess the question that I keep on thinking about
p171
aVwhen I see her
p172
aVand all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown,
p173
aVand even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning
p174
aVas not quite green \u2014
p175
aVwhen I look at all of that,
p176
aVthe question that my research seeks to answer
p177
aVbecomes, to me, the same one that confounded me all those years ago:
p178
aVIs she a monster
p179
aVor a hero?
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you.
