VI'm going to give you four specific examples,
p4
aVI'm going to cover at the end
p5
aVabout how a company called Silk tripled their sales;
p6
aVhow an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody
p7
aVto making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact;
p8
aVto how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.
p9
aVAnd one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years \u2014
p10
aVa record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."
p11
aa(lp12
VBefore I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread,
p13
aVand a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
p14
aVNow, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s
p15
aVI wonder what they said?
p16
aVLike the greatest invention since the telegraph or something.
p17
aVBut this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread,
p18
aVand he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.
p19
aVAnd the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this \u2014
p20
aVthat for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available
p21
aVno one bought it; no one knew about it;
p22
aVit was a complete and total failure.
p23
aVAnd the reason is that until Wonder came along
p24
aVand figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread,
p25
aVno one wanted it.
p26
aVThat the success of sliced bread,
p27
aVlike the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference,
p28
aVis not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like \u2014
p29
aVit's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.
p30
aVAnd I think that the way you're going to get what you want,
p31
aVor cause the change that you want to change, to happen,
p32
aVis to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop
p35
aVor you're an intellectual, or you're in business,
p36
aVor you're flying hot air balloons.
p37
aVI think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.
p38
aVThat what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.
p39
aVThat people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.
p40
aVWhen I talk about it I usually pick business,
p41
aVbecause they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation,
p42
aVand because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.
p43
aVBut I want you to forgive me when I use these examples
p44
aVbecause I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.
p45
aa(lp46
VAt the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.
p47
aVTV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.
p48
aVI call it the "TV-industrial complex."
p49
aVThe way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads,
p50
aVinterrupt some people, that gets you distribution.
p51
aVYou use the distribution you get to sell more products.
p52
aVYou take the profit from that to buy more ads.
p53
aVAnd it goes around and around and around,
p54
aVthe same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.
p55
aVThat model of, and we heard it yesterday \u2014
p56
aVif we could only get onto the homepage of Google,
p57
aVif we could only figure out how to get promoted there,
p58
aVor grab that person by the throat,
p59
aVand tell them about what we want to do.
p60
aVIf we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.
p61
aVWell, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.
p62
aVI mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out
p63
aVhow to touch people in a way they weren't expecting,
p64
aVin a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad,
p65
aVover and over again until they bought it.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
p68
aVThat just over the last few years,
p69
aVwhat anybody who markets anything has discovered
p70
aVis that it's not working the way that it used to.
p71
aVThis picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VBut the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.
p76
aVI go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.
p77
aVThe brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars
p78
aVtrying to interrupt me in one year.
p79
aV100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials
p80
aVand magazine ads and Spam
p81
aVand coupons and shelving allowances and spiff \u2014
p82
aVall so I could ignore every single message.
p83
aVAnd I ignored every message
p84
aVbecause I don't have a pain reliever problem.
p85
aVI buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.
p86
aVAnd I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem,
p87
aVbecause I don't care.
p88
aa(lp89
VHere's a magazine called "Hydrate." It's 180 pages about water.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VArticles about water, ads about water.
p94
aVImagine what the world was like 40 years ago,
p95
aVwith just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.
p96
aVNow there are magazines about water.
p97
aVNew product from Coke Japan: water salad.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VCoke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks,
p102
aVbecause they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.
p103
aVI couldn't have written this better myself.
p104
aVIt came out four days ago \u2014
p105
aVI circled the important parts so you can see them here.
p106
aVThey've come out...
p107
aVArby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt
p108
aVwith the voice of Tom Arnold,
p109
aVhoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial
p114
aVfeaturing Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car,
p115
aVdrive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, this is Copernicus, and he was right,
p120
aVwhen he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.
p121
aV"The world revolves around me."
p122
aVMe, me, me, me. My favorite person \u2014 me.
p123
aVI don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail."
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSo consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway;
p128
aVI mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something,
p129
aVor people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article.
p130
aVConsumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.
p131
aVPart of the reason is \u2014 they've got way more choices than they used to,
p132
aVand way less time.
p133
aVAnd in a world where we have too many choices and too little time,
p134
aVthe obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.
p135
aVAnd my parable here is you're driving down the road
p136
aVand you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.
p137
aVCows are invisible. Cows are boring.
p138
aVWho's going to stop and pull over and say \u2014 "Oh, look, a cow."
p139
aVNobody.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VBut if the cow was purple \u2014 isn't that a great special effect?
p144
aVI could do that again if you want.
p145
aVIf the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.
p146
aVI mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.
p147
aVThe thing that's going to decide what gets talked about,
p148
aVwhat gets done, what gets changed,
p149
aVwhat gets purchased, what gets built,
p150
aVis: "Is it remarkable?"
p151
aVAnd "remarkable" is a really cool word,
p152
aVbecause we think it just means "neat,"
p153
aVbut it also means "worth making a remark about."
p154
aVAnd that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.
p155
aVThat two of the hottest cars in the United States
p156
aVis a 55,000-dollar giant car,
p157
aVbig enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.
p158
aVPeople are paying full price for both,
p159
aVand the only thing they have in common
p160
aVis that they don't have anything in common.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VEvery week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.
p165
aVIt's never "The Godfather," it's never "Citizen Kane,"
p166
aVit's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star.
p167
aVBut the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.
p168
aVBecause it's new, because it's fresh.
p169
aVPeople saw it and said "I didn't know that was there"
p170
aVand they noticed it.
p171
aVTwo of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail \u2014
p172
aVone sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box,
p173
aVand one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.
p174
aVThe only thing they have in common is that they're different.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living,
p177
aVwe're in the fashion business.
p178
aVAnd people in the fashion business
p179
aVknow what it's like to be in the fashion business \u2014 they're used to it.
p180
aVThe rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.
p181
aVHow to understand
p182
aVthat it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads,
p183
aVor insisting on meetings with people.
p184
aVBut it's a totally different sort of process
p185
aVthat determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.
p186
aVThey sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs
p187
aVby reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.
p188
aVThey turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought,
p189
aVto something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.
p190
aVThis guy, Lionel Poilâne, the most famous baker in the world \u2014
p191
aVhe died two and a half months ago,
p192
aVand he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
p193
aVHe lived in Paris.
p194
aVLast year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.
p195
aVEvery loaf baked in a bakery he owned,
p196
aVby one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.
p197
aVAnd when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
p198
aVThey didn't want to buy his bread.
p199
aVIt didn't look like "French bread."
p200
aVIt wasn't what they expected.
p201
aVIt was neat; it was remarkable;
p202
aVand slowly, it spread from one person to another person
p203
aVuntil finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.
p204
aVNow he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat marketers used to do is make average products for average people.
p207
aVThat's what mass marketing is.
p208
aVSmooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.
p209
aVThey would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.
p210
aVIt was all about going for the center.
p211
aVBut in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken,
p212
aVI don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.
p213
aVI think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
p214
aVbecause they're really good at ignoring you.
p215
aVBut market to these people because they care.
p216
aVThese are the people who are obsessed with something.
p217
aVAnd when you talk to them, they'll listen,
p218
aVbecause they like listening \u2014 it's about them.
p219
aVAnd if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve,
p220
aVand it'll spread.
p221
aVIt'll spread to the entire curve.
p222
aa(lp223
VThey have something I call "otaku" \u2014 it's a great Japanese word.
p224
aVIt describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say,
p225
aVdrive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place,
p226
aVbecause that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.
p227
aVTo make a product, to market an idea,
p228
aVto come up with any problem you want to solve
p229
aVthat doesn't have a constituency with an otaku,
p230
aVis almost impossible.
p231
aVInstead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares
p232
aVabout what it is you have to say.
p233
aVTalk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
p234
aVThere's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.
p235
aVThat's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces,
p236
aVand not so many kinds of mustard.
p237
aVNot because it's hard to make interesting mustard \u2014
p238
aVyou could make interesting mustard \u2014
p239
aVbut people don't, because no one's obsessed with it,
p240
aVand thus no one tells their friends.
p241
aVKrispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.
p242
aVIt has a strategy, and what they do is,
p243
aVthey enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku,
p244
aVand then they spread through the city
p245
aVto the people who've just crossed the street.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.
p248
aVNot everybody wants it but they don't care.
p249
aVThey want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.
p250
aVThese guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VIt's as loud as a 747 jet.
p255
aa(lp256
VYou can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass,
p257
aVbecause it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.
p258
aVBut the fact remains
p259
aVthat when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car,
p260
aVif they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does,
p261
aVthey go ahead and they pick this.
p262
aa(lp263
VIt's really simple \u2014 you sell to the people who are listening,
p264
aVand just maybe, those people tell their friends.
p265
aVSo when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote,
p266
aVwho are all tuned in from 130 countries
p267
aVwatching his two-hour commercial \u2014
p268
aVthat's the only thing keeping his company in business \u2014
p269
aVit's that those 50,000 people care desperately enough
p270
aVto watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.
p271
aVPearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.
p272
aVEvery one made a profit. How?
p273
aVThey only sell them on their website.
p274
aVThose people who buy them have the otaku,
p275
aVand then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.
p276
aVThis hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.
p277
aVBut hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.
p278
aVHard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody,
p279
aVbut to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.
p280
aVThis paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company,
p281
aVmaking them a fortune.
p282
aVIt costs 35 percent more than regular paint
p283
aVbecause Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.
p284
aVThey didn't just slap a new ad on the product;
p285
aVthey changed what it meant to build a paint product.
p286
aVAmIhotornot.com \u2014 everyday 250,000 people go to this site,
p287
aVrun by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders \u2014
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VThey didn't get this way by advertising a lot.
p292
aVThey got this way by being remarkable,
p293
aVsometimes a little too remarkable.
p294
aVAnd this picture frame has a cord going out the back,
p295
aVand you plug it into the wall.
p296
aVMy father has this on his desk,
p297
aVand he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.
p298
aVAnd every single person who walks into his office
p299
aVhears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.
p300
aVAnd one person at a time, the idea spreads.
p301
aVThese are not diamonds, not really.
p302
aVThey're made from "cremains."
p303
aVAfter you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VOh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VFastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry.
p312
aVBut you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne \u2014
p313
aVyou don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.
p314
aVWhat you have to do
p315
aVis figure out what people really want and give it to them.
p316
aa(lp317
VA couple of quick rules to wrap up.
p318
aVThe first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.
p319
aVThe people who come up with stuff that's remarkable
p320
aVmore often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.
p321
aVNumber two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.
p322
aVProctor and Gamble knows this, right?
p323
aVThe whole model of being Proctor and Gamble
p324
aVis always about average products for average people.
p325
aVThat's risky.
p326
aVThe safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes,
p327
aVbe remarkable.
p328
aVAnd being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.
p329
aVVery good is boring. Very good is average.
p330
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're making a record album,
p331
aVor you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.
p332
aVIf it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo my three stories.
p335
aVSilk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section
p336
aVnext to the milk in the refrigerated section.
p337
aVSales tripled. Why?
p338
aVMilk, milk, milk, milk, milk \u2014 not milk.
p339
aVFor the people who were there and looking at that section,
p340
aVit was remarkable.
p341
aVThey didn't triple their sales with advertising;
p342
aVthey tripled it by doing something remarkable.
p343
aVThat is a remarkable piece of art.
p344
aVYou don't have to like it,
p345
aVbut a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City
p346
aVis remarkable.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VFrank Gehry didn't just change a museum;
p351
aVhe changed an entire city's economy
p352
aVby designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.
p353
aVNow, at countless meetings at, you know,
p354
aVthe Portland City Council, or who knows where,
p355
aVthey said, we need an architect \u2014 can we get Frank Gehry?
p356
aVBecause he did something that was at the fringes.
p357
aVAnd my big failure? I came out with an entire \u2014
p358
aa(lp359
V(Music)
p360
aa(lp361
VA record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums
p362
aVin SACD, this remarkable new format \u2014
p363
aVand I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos.
p364
aVPeople with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VSo what you need to do is figure out who does care.
p369
aVWho is going to raise their hand and say,
p370
aV"I want to hear what you're doing next,"
p371
aVand sell something to them.
p372
aVThe last example I want to give you.
p373
aVThis is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.
p374
aVAs you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VBut they do have a lake.
p379
aVAnd people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.
p380
aVThey don't anymore.
p381
aVSo the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.
p382
aVWhat can we build here?"
p383
aVAnd like most committees,
p384
aVthey were going to build something pretty safe.
p385
aVAnd then an artist came to them \u2014 this is a true artist's rendering \u2014
p386
aVhe wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.
p387
aVThat's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
p388
aVI don't know about you,
p389
aVbut if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.
p390
