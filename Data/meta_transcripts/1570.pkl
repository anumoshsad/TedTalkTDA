VSo, this is my grandfather,
p4
aVSalman Schocken,
p5
aVwho was born into a poor and uneducated family
p6
aVwith six children to feed,
p7
aVand when he was 14 years old, he was forced to
p8
aVdrop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
p9
aVHe never went back to school.
p10
aVInstead, he went on to build a glittering empire
p11
aVof department stores.
p12
aVSalman was the consummate perfectionist,
p13
aVand every one of his stores was a jewel
p14
aVof Bauhaus architecture.
p15
aVHe was also the ultimate self-learner,
p16
aVand like everything else, he did it in grand style.
p17
aVHe surrounded himself with an entourage
p18
aVof young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber
p19
aVand Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,
p20
aVand he paid each one of them a monthly salary
p21
aVso that they could write in peace.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.
p24
aVHe fled Germany, together with his family,
p25
aVleaving everything else behind.
p26
aVHis department stores confiscated,
p27
aVhe spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit
p28
aVof art and culture.
p29
aVThis high school dropout
p30
aVdied at the age of 82,
p31
aVa formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO
p32
aVof the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
p33
aVand founder of Schocken Books,
p34
aVan acclaimed imprint that was later acquired
p35
aVby Random House.
p36
aVSuch is the power of self-study.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd these are my parents.
p39
aVThey too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
p40
aVThey were too busy building a family and a country.
p41
aVAnd yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,
p42
aVtenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked
p43
aVwith thousands of books, records and artwork.
p44
aVI remember quite vividly my father telling me
p45
aVthat when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,
p46
aVthen we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd that's me,
p49
aVI was going to say holding my first abacus,
p50
aVbut actually holding what my father would consider
p51
aVan ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)
p52
aVSo one thing that I took from home is this notion
p53
aVthat educators don't necessarily have to teach.
p54
aVInstead, they can provide an environment and resources
p55
aVthat tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.
p56
aVSelf-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:
p57
aVthese are the virtues of a great education.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,
p60
aVself-empowering computer science course
p61
aVthat I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
p62
aVAs you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I
p63
aVhad an early fascination with first principles,
p64
aVand over the years, as our knowledge of
p65
aVscience and technology became more sophisticated,
p66
aVthis early awe with the basics
p67
aVhas only intensified.
p68
aVSo it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when
p69
aVNoam and I were already computer science professors,
p70
aVwe were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.
p71
aVAs computers became increasingly more complex,
p72
aVour students were losing the forest for the trees,
p73
aVand indeed, it is impossible to connect
p74
aVwith the soul of the machine if you interact
p75
aVwith a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded
p76
aVby numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.
p77
aVSo Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students
p78
aVto understand how computers work,
p79
aVand understand it in the marrow of their bones,
p80
aVthen perhaps the best way to go about it
p81
aVis to have them build a complete, working,
p82
aVgeneral-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,
p83
aVfrom the ground up, from first principles.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I
p86
aVdecided to base our cathedral, so to speak,
p87
aVon the simplest possible building block,
p88
aVwhich is something called NAND.
p89
aVIt is nothing more than a trivial logic gate
p90
aVwith four input-output states.
p91
aVSo we now start this journey by telling our students
p92
aVthat God gave us NAND \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p93
aVand told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,
p94
aVGod said, "One step at a time."
p95
aVAnd then, following this advice, we start
p96
aVwith this lowly, humble NAND gate,
p97
aVand we walk our students through an elaborate sequence
p98
aVof projects in which they gradually build a chip set,
p99
aVa hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,
p100
aVa basic operating system and a compiler
p101
aVfor a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK."
p102
aVThe students celebrate the end of this tour de force
p103
aVby using JACK to write all sorts of cool games
p104
aVlike Pong, Snake and Tetris.
p105
aVYou can imagine the tremendous joy of playing
p106
aVwith a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK
p107
aVand then compiled into machine language in a compiler
p108
aVthat you wrote also, and then seeing the result
p109
aVrunning on a machine that you built starting
p110
aVwith nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.
p111
aVIt's a tremendous personal triumph of going
p112
aVfrom first principles all the way to a fantastically complex
p113
aVand useful system.
p114
aa(lp115
VNoam and I worked five years to facilitate
p116
aVthis ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure
p117
aVthat will enable students to build it in one semester.
p118
aVAnd this is the great team that helped us make it happen.
p119
aVThe trick was to decompose the computer's construction
p120
aVinto numerous stand-alone modules,
p121
aVeach of which could be individually specified,
p122
aVbuilt and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.
p123
aVAnd from day one, Noam and I decided to put
p124
aVall these building blocks freely available in open source
p125
aVon the Web.
p126
aVSo chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,
p127
aVsoftware tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,
p128
aVstacks of hundreds of slides, lectures \u2014
p129
aVwe laid out everything on the Web
p130
aVand invited the world to come over,
p131
aVtake whatever they need,
p132
aVand do whatever they want with it.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd then something fascinating happened.
p135
aVThe world came.
p136
aVAnd in short order, thousands of people
p137
aVwere building our machine.
p138
aVAnd NAND2Tetris became one of the first
p139
aVmassive, open, online courses,
p140
aValthough seven years ago we had no idea that what
p141
aVwe were doing is called MOOCs.
p142
aVWe just observed how self-organized courses
p143
aVwere kind of spontaneously spawning
p144
aVout of our materials.
p145
aVFor example, Pramode C.E.,
p146
aVan engineer from Kerala, India,
p147
aVhas organized groups of self-learners
p148
aVwho build our computer under his good guidance.
p149
aVAnd Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,
p150
aVhas unbundled our projects into smaller,
p151
aVmore manageable bites that he now serves
p152
aVin his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe people who are attracted to these courses
p155
aVtypically have a hacker mentality.
p156
aVThey want to figure out how things work,
p157
aVand they want to do it in groups,
p158
aVlike this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,
p159
aVthat uses our materials to offer community courses.
p160
aVAnd because these materials are widely available
p161
aVand open-source, different people take them
p162
aVto very different and unpredictable directions.
p163
aVFor example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,
p164
aVhas used FPGA technology
p165
aVto build our computer and show others how to do the same
p166
aVusing a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed
p167
aVa very nice computer game that unfolds
p168
aVinside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex
p169
aV3D maze that Ben developed
p170
aVusing the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.
p171
aVThe Minecraft community went bananas over this project,
p172
aVand Ben became an instant media celebrity.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd indeed, for quite a few people,
p175
aVtaking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,
p176
aVhas turned into a life-changing experience.
p177
aVFor example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music
p178
aVand math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
p179
aVA few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post
p180
aVon our website, and I'd like to read it to you.
p181
aVSo here's what Dan said.
p182
aa(lp183
V"I did the coursework because understanding computers
p184
aVis important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,
p185
aVand I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,
p186
aVnever been challenged to this degree.
p187
aVBut given what I now feel capable of doing,
p188
aVI would certainly do it again.
p189
aVTo anyone considering NAND2Tetris,
p190
aVit's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."
p191
aa(lp192
VSo Dan demonstrates the many self-learners
p193
aVwho take this course off the Web, on their own traction,
p194
aVon their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because
p195
aVthese people cannot care less about
p196
aVgrades.
p197
aVThey are doing it because of one motivation only.
p198
aVThey have a tremendous passion to learn.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd with that in mind,
p201
aVI'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
p202
aVI'm sick of it.
p203
aVWe are obsessed with grades
p204
aVbecause we are obsessed with data,
p205
aVand yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,
p206
aVand a huge part of education
p207
aVis about failing.
p208
aVCourage, according to Churchill,
p209
aVis the ability to go from one defeat to another
p210
aVwithout losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)
p211
aVAnd [Joyce] said that mistakes
p212
aVare the portals of discovery.
p213
aVAnd yet we don't tolerate mistakes,
p214
aVand we worship grades.
p215
aVSo we collect your B pluses and your A minuses
p216
aVand we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,
p217
aVwhich is stamped on your forehead
p218
aVand sums up who you are.
p219
aVWell, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,
p220
aVand grading became degrading.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,
p223
aVand share with you a glimpse from my current project,
p224
aVwhich is different from the previous one,
p225
aVbut it shares exactly the same characteristics
p226
aVof self-learning, learning by doing,
p227
aVself-exploration and community-building,
p228
aVand this project deals with K-12 math education,
p229
aVbeginning with early age math,
p230
aVand we do it on tablets because we believe that
p231
aVmath, like anything else, should be taught hands on.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo here's what we do. Basically, we developed
p234
aVnumerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining
p235
aVa particular concept in math.
p236
aVSo for example, let's take area.
p237
aVWhen you deal with a concept like area \u2014
p238
aVwell, we also provide a set of tools that the child
p239
aVis invited to experiment with in order to learn.
p240
aVSo if area is what interests us, then one thing
p241
aVwhich is natural to do is to tile the area
p242
aVof this particular shape and simply count
p243
aVhow many tiles it takes to cover it completely.
p244
aVAnd this little exercise here gives you a first
p245
aVgood insight of the notion of area.
p246
aa(lp247
VMoving along, what about the area of this figure?
p248
aVWell, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.
p249
aVSo instead, you can experiment
p250
aVwith these different tools here by some process
p251
aVof guided trial and error,
p252
aVand at some point you will discover that one thing
p253
aVthat you can do among several legitimate transformations
p254
aVis the following one. You can cut the figure,
p255
aVyou can rearrange the parts, you can glue them
p256
aVand then proceed to tile just like we did before.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aVNow this particular transformation
p259
aVdid not change the area of the original figure,
p260
aVso a six-year-old who plays with this
p261
aVhas just discovered a clever algorithm
p262
aVto compute the area of any given parallelogram.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe don't replace teachers, by the way.
p265
aVWe believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.
p266
aa(lp267
VMoving along, what about the area of a triangle?
p268
aVSo after some guided trial and error,
p269
aVthe child will discover, with or without help,
p270
aVthat he or she can duplicate the original figure
p271
aVand then take the result, transpose it,
p272
aVglue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:
p273
aVcut, rearrange, paste \u2014 oops\u2014 paste and glue,
p274
aVand tile.
p275
aVNow this transformation has doubled the area
p276
aVof the original figure, and therefore we have just learned
p277
aVthat the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle
p278
aVdivided by two.
p279
aVBut we discovered it by self-exploration.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo, in addition to learning some useful geometry,
p282
aVthe child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated
p283
aVscience strategies, like reduction,
p284
aVwhich is the art of
p285
aVtransforming a complex problem into a simple one,
p286
aVor generalization, which is at the heart
p287
aVof any scientific discipline,
p288
aVor the fact that some properties are invariant
p289
aVunder some transformations.
p290
aVAnd all this is something that a very young child
p291
aVcan pick up using such mobile apps.
p292
aVSo presently, we are doing the following:
p293
aVFirst of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum
p294
aVinto numerous such apps.
p295
aVAnd because we cannot do it on our own,
p296
aVwe've developed a very fancy authoring tool
p297
aVthat any author, any parent or actually anyone
p298
aVwho has an interest in math education,
p299
aVcan use this authoring tool to develop similar apps
p300
aVon tablets without programming.
p301
aVAnd finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem
p302
aVthat will match different learners
p303
aVwith different apps according to their evolving learning style.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe driving force behind this project
p306
aVis my colleague Shmulik London,
p307
aVand, you see, just like
p308
aVSalman did about 90 years ago,
p309
aVthe trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,
p310
aVbecause at the end,
p311
aVit's all about people.
p312
aVAnd a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv
p313
aVand I saw this graffiti on a wall,
p314
aVand I found it so compelling
p315
aVthat by now I preach it to my students,
p316
aVand I'd like to try to preach it to you.
p317
aVNow, I don't know how many people here are familiar
p318
aVwith the term "mensch."
p319
aVIt basically means to be human
p320
aVand to do the right thing.
p321
aVAnd with that, what this graffiti says is,
p322
aV"High-tech schmigh-tech.
p323
aVThe most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter)
p324
aVThank you. (Applause)
