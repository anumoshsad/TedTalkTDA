VI'm a bug lover, myself \u2014
p4
aVnot from childhood, by the way,
p5
aVbut rather late.
p6
aVWhen I bachelored,
p7
aVmajoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University,
p8
aVI kind of fell in love with bugs.
p9
aVAnd then, within zoology,
p10
aVI took the course or the discipline of entomology,
p11
aVthe science of insects.
p12
aVAnd then I thought to myself, how can I be practical
p13
aVor help in the science of entomology?
p14
aVAnd then I moved to the world of plant protection \u2014
p15
aVplant protection from insects,
p16
aVfrom bad bugs.
p17
aVAnd then within plant protection,
p18
aVI came into the discipline of biological pest control,
p19
aVwhich we actually define
p20
aVas the use of living organisms
p21
aVto reduce populations of noxious plant pests.
p22
aVSo it's a whole discipline in plant protection
p23
aVaimed at the reduction of chemicals.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd biological pest control, by the way,
p26
aVor these "good bugs" that we are talking about,
p27
aVthey've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years,
p28
aVfor a long, long time.
p29
aVBut only in the last 120 years,
p30
aVpeople started, or people knew more and more
p31
aVhow to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon,
p32
aVor in fact, natural control phenomenon,
p33
aVfor their own needs.
p34
aVBecause biological control phenomenon \u2014 you can see it in your backyard.
p35
aVJust take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here?
p36
aVThat's a magnifier, times 10.
p37
aVYou just open it, twist leaves,
p38
aVand you see a whole new world of minute insects,
p39
aVor little spiders of one millimeter, one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,
p40
aVand you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones.
p41
aVSo this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere.
p42
aVHere, in front of this building, I'm sure.
p43
aVJust have a look at the plants.
p44
aVSo it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it.
p45
aa(lp46
VWell, let's go hand by hand
p47
aVand browse through just a few examples.
p48
aVWhat is a pest?
p49
aVWhat damage does it actually inflict on the plant?
p50
aVAnd what is the natural enemy,
p51
aVthe biological control agent, or the "good bug"
p52
aVthat we're talking about?
p53
aVIn general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders,
p54
aVor mites, let us call them.
p55
aVInsects, those six-legged organisms
p56
aVand spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms.
p57
aVLet's have a look at that.
p58
aVHere is a devastating pest, a spider mite,
p59
aVbecause it does a lot of webbing, like a spider.
p60
aVYou see the mother in between,
p61
aVand two daughters, probably, on the left and right,
p62
aVand a single egg on the right-hand side.
p63
aVAnd then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.
p64
aa(lp65
VOn your right-hand side, you can see a cucumber leaf,
p66
aVin the middle, a cotton leaf,
p67
aVand on the left, a tomato leaf with these little stipplings.
p68
aVThey can literally turn from green to white,
p69
aVbecause of the sucking, piercing mouth parts of those spiders.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut here comes nature, that provides us with a good spider.
p72
aVThis is a predatory mite \u2014 just as small as a spider mite;
p73
aVone, two millimeters long, not more than that \u2014
p74
aVrunning quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites.
p75
aVAnd here, you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side \u2014
p76
aVjust pierces, sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite.
p77
aVAnd after five minutes, this is what you see:
p78
aVjust a typical dead corpse \u2014
p79
aVthe shriveled, sucked-out, dead corpse of the spider mite,
p80
aVand next to it, two satiated individuals, predatory mites,
p81
aVa mother on the left-hand side, a young nymph on the right-hand side.
p82
aVBy the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,
p83
aVis about five of the spider mites, of the bad mites,
p84
aVand-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.
p85
aVBy the way, they are always hungry.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd here is another example: aphids.
p90
aVIt's springtime now in Israel.
p91
aVWhen temperatures rise sharply,
p92
aVyou can see those bad ones, those aphids, all over the plants \u2014
p93
aVin your hibiscus, in your lantana,
p94
aVin the young, fresh foliage of the so-called spring flush.
p95
aVBy the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons.
p96
aVFemales giving rise to females, giving rise to other females.
p97
aVNo males at all.
p98
aVParthenogenesis, as it's so called.
p99
aVAnd they're very happy with that, apparently.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VHere we can see the damage.
p104
aVThose aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew,
p105
aVand this just clogs the upper parts of the plant.
p106
aVHere you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned from green to black
p107
aVbecause of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd here comes the salvation, through this parasitic wasp.
p110
aVHere we are not talking about a predator.
p111
aVHere we are talking a parasite \u2014
p112
aVnot a two-legged parasite,
p113
aVbut an eight-legged parasite, of course.
p114
aVThis is a parasitic wasp,
p115
aVagain, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier.
p116
aVAnd here you can see this parasite in action,
p117
aVlike in an acrobatic maneuver.
p118
aVShe stands vis-à-vis
p119
aVin front of the victim at the right-hand side,
p120
aVbending its abdomen and inserting a single egg
p121
aVinto the body fluids of the aphid.
p122
aVBy the way, the aphid tries to escape.
p123
aVShe kicks and bites and secretes different liquids,
p124
aVbut nothing will happen, in fact \u2014
p125
aVonly the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted
p126
aVinto the body fluids of the aphid.
p127
aVAnd after a few days, depending upon temperature,
p128
aVthe egg will hatch
p129
aVand the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VThis is all natural. This is all natural.
p134
aVThis is not fiction, nothing at all.
p135
aVAgain \u2014 in your backyard. In your backyard.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut this is the end result: mummies.
p142
aVThis is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside,
p143
aVa developing parasitoid that, after a few minutes, you see halfway out.
p144
aVThe birth is almost complete.
p145
aVYou can see, by the way, in different movies, etc.,
p146
aVit takes just a few minutes.
p147
aVAnd if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male
p148
aVand off she goes, because time is very short.
p149
aVThis female can live only three to four days,
p150
aVand she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs.
p151
aVThat means she has 400 bad aphids
p152
aVto put her eggs into their body fluids.
p153
aVThis is, of course, not the end of it.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere is a whole wealth of other natural enemies
p156
aVand this is just the last example.
p157
aVAgain, we'll start first with the pest:
p158
aVthe thrips.
p159
aVBy the way, all these weird names \u2014
p160
aVI didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures,
p161
aVjust the popular names.
p162
aVBut this is a nice, slender, very bad pest.
p163
aVIf you can see this: sweet peppers.
p164
aVThis is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper.
p165
aVThis is a sweet pepper which is not consumable
p166
aVbecause it is suffering from a viral disease
p167
aVtransmitted by those thrip adults.
p168
aVAnd here comes the natural enemy, minute pirate bug \u2014
p169
aV"minute," because it is rather small.
p170
aVHere you can see the adult, black, and two young ones.
p171
aVAnd again, in action.
p172
aVThis adult pierces the thrips,
p173
aVsucking it within just several minutes,
p174
aVgoing to the other prey, continuing all over the place.
p175
aVAnd if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones,
p176
aVfor example, in a sweet pepper plot,
p177
aVthey go to the flowers.
p178
aVAnd look \u2014 this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones,
p179
aVafter wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.
p180
aVSo this is a very positive situation.
p181
aVNo harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set.
p182
aVEverything is just fine under these circumstances.
p183
aVBut again, the question is,
p184
aVhere you saw them on a one-to-one basis \u2014 the pest, the natural enemy.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhat we do is actually this.
p187
aVIn Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,
p188
aVthere is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies.
p189
aVIn other words, what we do there is amplify the natural control,
p190
aVor the biological control phenomenon.
p191
aVAnd in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses,
p192
aVthere, we are mass-producing those predatory mites,
p193
aVthose minute pirate bugs,
p194
aVthose parasitic wasps, etc.
p195
aVMany different parts.
p196
aVBy the way, they have a very nice landscape \u2014
p197
aVyou see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand,
p198
aVand the Jordan Valley on the other hand,
p199
aVand a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer,
p200
aVwhich is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures.
p201
aVAnd by the way, mass-production \u2014 it is not genetic manipulation.
p202
aVThere are no GMOs \u2014 genetically modified organisms \u2014 whatsoever.
p203
aVWe take them from nature,
p204
aVand the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions,
p205
aVunder the greenhouses or in the climate rooms,
p206
aVin order to proliferate, multiply and reproduce.
p207
aVAnd that's what we get.
p208
aa(lp209
VYou see under a microscope.
p210
aVYou see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite.
p211
aVAnd this is the whole bunch of predatory mites.
p212
aVYou see this ampul. You see this one.
p213
aVI have one gram of those predatory mites.
p214
aVOne gram is 80,000 individuals.
p215
aV80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre,
p216
aV4,000 square meters,
p217
aVof a strawberry plot
p218
aVagainst spider mites for the whole season
p219
aVof almost one year.
p220
aVAnd we can produce from this, believe you me,
p221
aVseveral dozens of kilograms on an annual basis.
p222
aVSo this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon.
p223
aVAnd no, we do not disrupt the balance.
p224
aVOn the contrary,
p225
aVbecause we bring it to every cultural plot
p226
aVwhere the balance was already disrupted
p227
aVby the chemicals.
p228
aVHere we come with those natural enemies
p229
aVin order to reverse a little bit of the wheel
p230
aVand to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot
p231
aVby reducing those chemicals.
p232
aVThat's the whole idea.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd what is the impact?
p235
aVIn this table, you can actually see what is an impact
p236
aVof a successful biological control by good bugs.
p237
aVFor example, in Israel, where we employ more than 1,000 hectares \u2014
p238
aV10,000 dunams in Israeli terms \u2014
p239
aVof biological pests controlling sweet pepper
p240
aVunder protection,
p241
aV75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced.
p242
aVAnd Israeli strawberries, even more \u2014
p243
aV80 percent of the pesticides,
p244
aVespecially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries.
p245
aVSo the impact is very strong.
p246
aVAnd there goes the question,
p247
aVespecially if you ask growers, agriculturists:
p248
aVWhy biological control?
p249
aVWhy good bugs?
p250
aVBy the way, the number of answers you get
p251
aVequals the number of people you ask.
p252
aVBut if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel,
p253
aVthe Arava area above the Great Rift Valley,
p254
aVwhere the pearl of Israeli agriculture is located,
p255
aVespecially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions \u2014
p256
aVif you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this
p257
aVjust in the middle of the desert.
p258
aVAnd if you zoom in,
p259
aVyou can definitely watch this:
p260
aVgrandparents with their grandchildren,
p261
aVdistributing the natural enemies, the good bugs,
p262
aVinstead of wearing special clothes
p263
aVand gas masks and applying chemicals.
p264
aVSo safety, with respect to the application,
p265
aVis the number one answer that we get from growers,
p266
aVfor "Why biological control?"
p267
aa(lp268
VNumber two, many growers are, in fact, petrified
p269
aVby the idea of resistance,
p270
aVthat the pests will become resistant to the chemicals,
p271
aVjust like in our case, that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics.
p272
aVIt's the same, and it can happen very quickly.
p273
aVFortunately, in either biological control or even natural control,
p274
aVresistance is extremely rare.
p275
aVIt hardly happens.
p276
aVBecause this is evolution, this is the natural ratio,
p277
aVunlike resistance, which happens in the case of chemicals.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd thirdly, public demand.
p280
aVThe more the public demands the reduction of chemicals,
p281
aVthe more growers become aware of the fact
p282
aVthat they should, wherever they can and wherever possible,
p283
aVreplace the chemical control with biological control.
p284
aVEven here, there is another grower,
p285
aVyou see, very interested in the bugs, the bad ones and the good ones,
p286
aVwearing this magnifier already on her head,
p287
aVjust walking safely in her crop.
p288
aa(lp289
VFinally, I want to get to my vision,
p290
aVor, in fact, to my dream.
p291
aVBecause, you see, this is the reality.
p292
aVHave a look at the gap.
p293
aVIf we take the overall turnover
p294
aVof the biocontrol industry worldwide,
p295
aVit's 250 million dollars.
p296
aVAnd look at the overall pesticide industry
p297
aVin all the crops throughout the world.
p298
aVI think it's times 100 or something like that.
p299
aVTwenty-five billion.
p300
aVSo there is a huge gap to bridge.
p301
aVSo actually, how can we do it?
p302
aVHow can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap over the years?
p303
aVFirst of all, we need to find more robust,
p304
aVgood and reliable biological solutions,
p305
aVmore good bugs that we can either mass-produce
p306
aVor actually conserve in the field.
p307
aVSecondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand
p308
aVfor the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce.
p309
aVAnd thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers
p310
aVto the potential of this industry.
p311
aVAnd this gap really narrows.
p312
aVStep by step, it does narrow.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo I think my last slide is:
p315
aVAll we are saying \u2014 we can actually sing it \u2014
p316
aVGive nature a chance.
p317
aVI'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners
p318
aVand implementers,
p319
aVin Israel and abroad,
p320
aVreally give nature a chance.
p321
aa(lp322
VThank you.
