(lp3
VSadly,
p4
aVin the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,
p5
aVfour Americans that are alive
p6
aVwill be dead through the food that they eat.
p7
aa(lp8
VMy name's Jamie Oliver.
p9
aVI'm 34 years old.
p10
aVI'm from Essex in England
p11
aVand for the last seven years
p12
aVI've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.
p13
aVI'm not a doctor;
p14
aVI'm a chef,
p15
aVI don't have expensive equipment
p16
aVor medicine.
p17
aVI use information, education.
p18
aa(lp19
VI profoundly believe that the power of food
p20
aVhas a primal place in our homes
p21
aVthat binds us to the best bits of life.
p22
aVWe have an awful, awful reality right now.
p23
aVAmerica, you're at the top of your game.
p24
aVThis is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
p25
aa(lp26
VCan I please just see a raise of hands
p27
aVfor how many of you have children in this room today?
p28
aVPut your hands up.
p29
aVYou can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.
p30
aVMost of you. OK.
p31
aVWe, the adults of the last four generations,
p32
aVhave blessed our children with the destiny
p33
aVof a shorter lifespan than their own parents.
p34
aVYour child will live a life ten years younger than you
p35
aVbecause of the landscape of food that we've built around them.
p36
aVTwo-thirds of this room,
p37
aVtoday, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.
p38
aVYou lot, you're all right,
p39
aVbut we'll get you eventually, don't worry.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThe statistics of bad health are clear,
p44
aVvery clear.
p45
aVWe spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,
p46
aVyou name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.
p47
aVLook at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.
p48
aVRight?
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VEvery single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.
p55
aVAny doctor, any specialist will tell you that.
p56
aVFact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer
p57
aVin the United States, right now, here today.
p58
aVThis is a global problem.
p59
aVIt's a catastrophe.
p60
aVIt's sweeping the world.
p61
aVEngland is right behind you, as usual.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VI know they were close, but not that close.
p66
aVWe need a revolution.
p67
aVMexico, Australia, Germany,
p68
aVIndia, China,
p69
aVall have massive problems of obesity and bad health.
p70
aVThink about smoking.
p71
aVIt costs way less than obesity now.
p72
aVObesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,
p73
aV150 billion dollars a year.
p74
aVIn 10 years, it's set to double:
p75
aV300 billion dollars a year.
p76
aVLet's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VI came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.
p81
aVWe need it. The time is now.
p82
aVWe're in a tipping-point moment.
p83
aVI've been doing this for seven years.
p84
aVI've been trying in America for seven years.
p85
aVNow is the time when it's ripe \u2014 ripe for the picking.
p86
aVI went to the eye of the storm.
p87
aVI went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.
p88
aVOr it was last year.
p89
aVWe've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VHuntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.
p94
aVI wanted to put heart and soul and people,
p95
aVyour public,
p96
aVaround the statistics that we've become so used to.
p97
aVI want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:
p98
aVyour public, your children.
p99
aVI want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.
p100
aVShe's 16 years old.
p101
aVShe's got six years to live
p102
aVbecause of the food that she's eaten.
p103
aVShe's the third generation of Americans
p104
aVthat hasn't grown up within a food environment
p105
aVwhere they've been taught to cook at home or in school,
p106
aVor her mom, or her mom's mom.
p107
aVShe has six years to live.
p108
aVShe's eating her liver to death.
p109
aa(lp110
VStacy, the Edwards family.
p111
aVThis is a normal family, guys.
p112
aVStacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;
p113
aVshe was never taught to cook at home or at school.
p114
aVThe family's obese.
p115
aVJustin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.
p116
aVHe gets bullied, for God's sake.
p117
aVThe daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.
p118
aVShe's obese before she even gets to primary school.
p119
aVMarissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.
p120
aVBut you know what?
p121
aVHer father, who was obese, died in her arms,
p122
aVAnd then the second most important man in her life,
p123
aVher uncle, died of obesity,
p124
aVand now her step-dad is obese.
p125
aVYou see, the thing is,
p126
aVobesity and diet-related disease
p127
aVdoesn't just hurt the people that have it;
p128
aVit's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.
p129
aa(lp130
VPastor Steve:
p131
aVan inspirational man,
p132
aVone of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.
p133
aVHe's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.
p134
aVHe has to bury the people, OK?
p135
aVAnd he's fed up with it.
p136
aVHe's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.
p137
aVCome winter, three times as many people die.
p138
aVHe's sick of it.
p139
aVThis is preventable disease. Waste of life.
p140
aVBy the way, this is what they get buried in.
p141
aVWe're not geared up to do this.
p142
aVCan't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.
p143
aVCan't even get them there. Forklift.
p144
aa(lp145
VOK, I see it as a triangle, OK?
p146
aVThis is our landscape of food.
p147
aVI need you to understand it.
p148
aVYou've probably heard all this before.
p149
aVOver the last 30 years,
p150
aVwhat's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?
p151
aVLet's be frank and honest.
p152
aVWell, modern-day life.
p153
aa(lp154
VLet's start with the Main Street.
p155
aVFast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.
p156
aVThe big brands are some of the most important powers,
p157
aVpowerful powers, in this country.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Sighs)
p160
aa(lp161
VSupermarkets as well.
p162
aVBig companies. Big companies.
p163
aVThirty years ago, most of the food
p164
aVwas largely local and largely fresh.
p165
aVNow it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,
p166
aVextra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.
p167
aVPortion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.
p168
aVLabeling is a massive problem.
p169
aVThe labeling in this country is a disgrace.
p170
aVThe industry wants to self-police themselves.
p171
aVWhat, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.
p172
aVHow can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?
p173
aa(lp174
VHome.
p175
aVThe biggest problem with the home
p176
aVis that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,
p177
aVwhat made our society.
p178
aVThat is not happening anymore.
p179
aVAnd you know, as we go to work and as life changes,
p180
aVand as life always evolves,
p181
aVwe kind of have to look at it holistically \u2014
p182
aVstep back for a moment, and re-address the balance.
p183
aVIt hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?
p184
aVI want to show you a situation
p185
aVthat is very normal right now; the Edwards family.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.
p188
aVThis stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.
p189
aVAnd I need you to know
p190
aVthat this is going to kill your children early.
p191
aVHow are you feeling?
p192
aa(lp193
VStacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.
p194
aVBut, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life
p195
aVand this isn't going to get them there.
p196
aVBut I'm killing them.
p197
aa(lp198
VJO: Yes you are. You are.
p199
aVBut we can stop that.
p200
aVNormal.
p201
aVLet's get on schools,
p202
aVsomething that I'm fairly much a specialist in.
p203
aVOK, school.
p204
aVWhat is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?
p205
aVSchool was always invented to arm us with the tools
p206
aVto make us creative, do wonderful things,
p207
aVmake us earn a living, etc., etc.
p208
aVYou know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?
p209
aVBut we haven't really evolved it
p210
aVto deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?
p211
aVSchool food is something
p212
aVthat most kids \u2014 31 million a day, actually \u2014
p213
aVhave twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,
p214
aV180 days of the year.
p215
aVSo you could say that school food is quite important, really,
p216
aVjudging the circumstances.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VBefore I crack into my rant,
p221
aVwhich I'm sure you're waiting for \u2014
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VI need to say one thing, and it's so important
p226
aVin, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds
p227
aVin the next three months.
p228
aVThe lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America \u2014
p229
aVI offer myself as their ambassador.
p230
aVI'm not slagging them off.
p231
aVThey're doing the best they can do.
p232
aVThey're doing their best.
p233
aVBut they're doing what they're told,
p234
aVand what they're being told to do is wrong.
p235
aVThe system is highly run by accountants;
p236
aVthere's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.
p237
aVThere's a problem:
p238
aVIf you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets
p239
aVand it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,
p240
aVyou can't duck and dive and write different things around things.
p241
aVIf you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,
p242
aVthe only thing you can do in these circumstances
p243
aVis buy cheaper shit.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow, the reality is,
p246
aVthe food that your kids get every day is fast food,
p247
aVit's highly processed,
p248
aVthere's not enough fresh food in there at all.
p249
aVYou know, the amount of additives, E numbers,
p250
aVingredients you wouldn't believe \u2014
p251
aVthere's not enough veggies at all.
p252
aVFrench fries are considered a vegetable.
p253
aVPizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.
p254
aVKnives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.
p255
aVThey have scissors in the classroom,
p256
aVbut knives and forks? No.
p257
aVAnd the way I look at it is:
p258
aVIf you don't have knives and forks in your school,
p259
aVyou're purely endorsing,
p260
aVfrom a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.
p261
aVAnd yes, by the way, it is fast food:
p262
aVIt's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,
p263
aVit's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Sighs)
p266
aa(lp267
VTen percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,
p268
aVis on obesity, and it's going to double.
p269
aVWe're not teaching our kids.
p270
aVThere's no statutory right to teach kids about food,
p271
aVelementary or secondary school, OK?
p272
aVWe don't teach kids about food, right?
p273
aVAnd this is a little clip from an elementary school,
p274
aVwhich is very common in England.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Video) Who knows what this is?
p277
aa(lp278
VChild: Potatoes.
p279
aa(lp280
VJamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?
p281
aVDo you know what that is?
p282
aVDo you know what that is?
p283
aa(lp284
VChild: Broccoli?
p285
aa(lp286
VJO: What about this? Our good old friend.
p287
aa(lp288
VChild: Celery.
p289
aa(lp290
VJO: No. What do you think this is?
p291
aa(lp292
VChild: Onion. JO: Onion? No.
p293
aa(lp294
VJO: Immediately you get a really clear sense
p295
aVof "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"
p296
aVWho knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?
p297
aa(lp298
VJO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.
p299
aa(lp300
VJO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,
p301
aVthen they will never eat it.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VJO: Normal. England and America,
p306
aVEngland and America.
p307
aVGuess what fixed that.
p308
aVTwo one-hour sessions.
p309
aVWe've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VI want to tell you about something
p314
aVthat kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?
p315
aVI want to talk about something so basic as milk.
p316
aVEvery kid has the right to milk at school.
p317
aVYour kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?
p318
aVThey'll be having two bottles, OK?
p319
aVAnd most kids do.
p320
aVBut milk ain't good enough anymore.
p321
aVDon't get me wrong, I support milk \u2014
p322
aVbut someone at the milk board
p323
aVprobably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out
p324
aVthat if you put loads of flavorings,
p325
aVcolorings and sugar in milk,
p326
aVmore kids will drink it.
p327
aVYeah.
p328
aa(lp329
VObviously now that's going to catch on
p330
aVthe apple board is going to work out
p331
aVthat if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.
p332
aVDo you know what I mean?
p333
aVFor me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.
p334
aVOkay? There's sugar in everything.
p335
aVI know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
p336
aVIt's in everything.
p337
aVEven the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.
p338
aVThere's our milk. There's our carton.
p339
aVIn that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,
p340
aVand they are having two a day.
p341
aVSo, let me just show you.
p342
aVWe've got one kid, here \u2014
p343
aVhaving, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.
p344
aVYou know, there's your week.
p345
aVThere's your month.
p346
aVAnd I've taken the liberty of putting in
p347
aVjust the five years of elementary school sugar,
p348
aVjust from milk.
p349
aVNow, I don't know about you guys,
p350
aVbut judging the circumstances, right,
p351
aVany judge in the whole world,
p352
aVwould look at the statistics and the evidence,
p353
aVand they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.
p354
aVThat's my belief.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause ends)
p359
aa(lp360
VNow, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today
p361
aVand hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,
p362
aVyou'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.
p363
aVThis, all this bad news, is preventable.
p364
aVThat's the good news.
p365
aVIt's very, very preventable.
p366
aVSo, let's just think about, we got a problem here,
p367
aVwe need to reboot.
p368
aVOkay so, in my world, what do we need to do?
p369
aVHere is the thing, right,
p370
aVit cannot just come from one source.
p371
aVTo reboot and make real tangible change,
p372
aVreal change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes
p373
aVand say, "In 10 years' time,
p374
aVthe history of your children's lives,
p375
aVhappiness \u2014 and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,
p376
aVyou know you're going to live longer \u2014
p377
aVall of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"
p378
aa(lp379
VSo, supermarkets.
p380
aVWhere else do you shop so religiously?
p381
aVWeek in, week out.
p382
aVHow much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?
p383
aVLove them.
p384
aVThey just sell us what we want. All right.
p385
aVThey owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.
p386
aVThey need to help us shop.
p387
aVThey need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals
p388
aVfor people that are busy.
p389
aVThis is not expensive.
p390
aVIt is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board
p391
aVin America soon, and quick.
p392
aVThe big brands, you know, the food brands,
p393
aVneed to put food education at the heart of their businesses.
p394
aVI know, easier said than done.
p395
aVIt's the future. It's the only way.
p396
aa(lp397
VFast food.
p398
aVWith the fast-food industry
p399
aVyou know, it's very competitive.
p400
aVI've had loads of secret papers and dealings
p401
aVwith fast food restaurants.
p402
aVI know how they do it.
p403
aVI mean, basically they've weaned us on
p404
aVto these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,
p405
aVand everyone loves them, right?
p406
aVSo, these guys are going to be part of the solution.
p407
aVBut we need to get the government to work
p408
aVwith all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,
p409
aVand over a five, six, seven year period
p410
aVwean of us off the extreme amounts
p411
aVof fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.
p412
aa(lp413
VNow, also, back to the sort of big brands:
p414
aVlabeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce
p415
aVand has got to be sorted.
p416
aVOK, school.
p417
aVObviously, in schools, we owe it to them
p418
aVto make sure those 180 days of the year,
p419
aVfrom that little precious age of four,
p420
aVuntil 18, 20, 24, whatever,
p421
aVthey need to be cooked proper, fresh food
p422
aVfrom local growers on site, OK?
p423
aVThere needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food
p424
aVfor your children, yeah?
p425
aa(lp426
V(Applause)
p427
aa(lp428
VUnder the circumstances, it's profoundly important
p429
aVthat every single American child leaves school
p430
aVknowing how to cook 10 recipes
p431
aVthat will save their life.
p432
aVLife skills.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Applause)
p435
aa(lp436
VThat means that they can be students, young parents,
p437
aVand be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,
p438
aVno matter what recession hits them next time.
p439
aVIf you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.
p440
aVIf you can cook, time doesn't matter.
p441
aVThe workplace, we haven't really talked about it.
p442
aVYou know, it's now time for corporate responsibility
p443
aVto really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.
p444
aVThe staff are the moms and dads of America's children.
p445
aVMarissa, her father died in her hand,
p446
aVI think she'd be quite happy
p447
aVif corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.
p448
aVDefinitely they shouldn't be left out.
p449
aVLet's go back to the home.
p450
aa(lp451
VNow, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,
p452
aVit's so achievable.
p453
aVYou can care and be commercial.
p454
aVAbsolutely.
p455
aVBut the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
p456
aVFor sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
p457
aVAnd for me, it's quite romantic,
p458
aVbut it's about if one person teaches three people
p459
aVhow to cook something,
p460
aVand they teach three of their mates,
p461
aVthat only has to repeat itself 25 times,
p462
aVand that's the whole population of America.
p463
aVRomantic, yes, but most importantly,
p464
aVit's about trying to get people to realize

aVtrying to get a few things to work when they weren't,
