VThis is my niece, Stella.
p4
aVShe's just turned one and started to walk.
p5
aVAnd she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do,
p6
aVa kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.
p7
aVIt is absolutely gorgeous.
p8
aVAnd one of her favorite  things to do at the moment
p9
aVis to stare at herself in the mirror.
p10
aVShe absolutely loves her reflection.
p11
aVShe giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.
p12
aVIt is beautiful.
p13
aVApparently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this,
p14
aVand it got me thinking:
p15
aVWhen did I stop doing this?
p16
aVWhen is it suddenly not okay to love  the way that we look?
p17
aVBecause apparently we don't.
p18
aa(lp19
VTen thousand people every month google,
p20
aV"Am I ugly?"
p21
aVThis is Faye. Faye is 13 and she  lives in Denver.
p22
aVAnd like any teenager, she just wants to  be liked and to fit in.
p23
aVIt's Sunday night.
p24
aVShe's getting ready for the week ahead at school.
p25
aVAnd she's slightly dreading it, and  she's a bit confused because
p26
aVdespite her mom telling her all the time
p27
aVthat she's beautiful,
p28
aVevery day at school, someone tells her  that she's ugly.
p29
aVBecause of the difference between what her mom  tells her and what her friends
p30
aVat school, or her peers at school are telling her,
p31
aVshe doesn't know who to believe.
p32
aVSo, she takes a video of herself.  She posts it to YouTube
p33
aVand she asks people to please leave  a comment:
p34
aV"Am I pretty or am I ugly?"
p35
aVWell, so far, Faye has received  over 13,000 comments.
p36
aVSome of them are so nasty, they don't  bear thinking about.
p37
aVThis is an average, healthy-looking  teenage girl receiving this feedback
p38
aVat one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.
p39
aVThousands of people are posting videos like this,
p40
aVmostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.
p41
aVBut what's leading them to do this?
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
p44
aVThey're under pressure to be online and available at all times,
p45
aVtalking, messaging, liking, commenting,  sharing, posting \u2014
p46
aVit never ends.
p47
aVNever before have we been so connected,
p48
aVso continuously, so instantaneously, so young.
p49
aVAnd as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.
p50
aVThere's simply no privacy.
p51
aVAnd the social pressures that go along  with that are relentless.
p52
aVThis always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves
p53
aVbased on the number of likes they get
p54
aVand the types of comments that they receive.
p55
aVThere's no separation between online and offline life.
p56
aVWhat's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.
p57
aVAnd it's also really hard to tell the difference  between what's authentic
p58
aVand what's digitally manipulated.
p59
aVWhat's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd where are they looking to for inspiration?
p62
aVWell, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds
p63
aVof girls today.
p64
aVSize zero models still dominate our catwalks.
p65
aVAirbrushing is now routine.
p66
aVAnd trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,
p67
aV#bikinibridge and #proana.
p68
aVFor those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.
p69
aVThese trends are teamed with the  stereotyping and flagrant objectification
p70
aVof women in today's popular culture.
p71
aVIt is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.
p72
aVBut boys are not immune to this either.
p73
aVAspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars
p74
aVand playboy music artists.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut, what's the problem with all of this?
p77
aVWell, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy,  well balanced individuals.
p78
aVBut in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids
p79
aVto spend more time and mental effort on  their appearance
p80
aVat the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.
p81
aVSo, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities,
p82
aVand their studies and so on begin to suffer.
p83
aVSix out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do  something because they don't
p84
aVthink they look good enough.
p85
aVThese are not trivial activities.
p86
aVThese are fundamental activities to their development as humans
p87
aVand as contributors to society and to  the workforce.
p88
aVThirty-one percent, nearly one in  three teenagers, are withdrawing
p89
aVfrom classroom debate. They're failing
p90
aVto engage in classroom debate because
p91
aVthey don't want to draw attention to the  way that they look.
p92
aVOne in five are not showing up to class at all
p93
aVon days when they don't feel good about it.
p94
aVAnd when it comes to exams,
p95
aVif you don't think you look good enough,
p96
aVspecifically if you don't think you are thin enough,
p97
aVyou will score a lower grade point average
p98
aVthan your peers who are not concerned with this.
p99
aVAnd this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.
p100
aVand China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.
p101
aVSo to be super clear, we're talking about the
p102
aVway you think you look, not how you actually look.
p103
aVLow body confidence is undermining  academic achievement.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut it's also damaging health.
p106
aVTeenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity,
p107
aVeat less fruits and vegetables,
p108
aVpartake in more unhealthy weight control practices
p109
aVthat can lead to eating disorders.
p110
aVThey have lower self-esteem.
p111
aVThey're more easily influenced by people around them
p112
aVand they're at greater risk of depression.
p113
aVAnd we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks
p114
aVwith things like alcohol and drug use;
p115
aVcrash dieting; cosmetic surgery;  unprotected, earlier sex;
p116
aVand self-harm.
p117
aVThe pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems
p118
aVand costing our governments billions of  dollars every year.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd we don't grow out of it.
p121
aVWomen who think they're overweight \u2014 again,
p122
aVregardless of whether they are or are not \u2014
p123
aVhave higher rates of absenteeism.
p124
aVSeventeen percent of women would
p125
aVnot show up to a job interview on
p126
aVa day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.
p127
aa(lp128
VHave a think about what this is doing
p129
aVto our economy.
p130
aVIf we could overcome this, what that
p131
aVopportunity looks like.
p132
aVUnlocking this potential is in the interest
p133
aVof every single one of us.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut how do we do that?
p136
aVWell, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
p137
aVIt's not enough by itself.
p138
aVIf you actually want to make a difference,
p139
aVyou have to do something.
p140
aVAnd we've learned there are three key ways:
p141
aVThe first is we have to educate for body confidence.
p142
aVWe have to help our teenagers develop
p143
aVstrategies to overcome image-related pressures
p144
aVand build their self-esteem.
p145
aVNow, the good news is that there are
p146
aVmany programs out there available to do this.
p147
aVThe bad news is that most of them don't work.
p148
aVI was shocked to learn that many well-meaning
p149
aVprograms are inadvertently actually
p150
aVmaking the situation worse.
p151
aVSo we need to make damn sure that
p152
aVthe programs that our kids are receiving
p153
aVare not only having a positive impact,
p154
aVbut having a lasting impact as well.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd the research shows  that the best programs
p157
aVaddress six key areas:
p158
aVThe first is the influence of family,  friends and relationships.
p159
aVThe second is media and celebrity culture,
p160
aVthen how to handle teasing and bullying,
p161
aVthe way we compete and compare with one another
p162
aVbased on looks,
p163
aVtalking about appearance \u2014 some people
p164
aVcall this "body talk" or "fat talk" \u2014
p165
aVand finally, the foundations of respecting
p166
aVand looking after yourself.
p167
aVThese six things are crucial starting points
p168
aVfor anyone serious about delivering
p169
aVbody-confidence education that works.
p170
aVAn education is critical,
p171
aVbut tackling this problem is going
p172
aVto require each and everyone of us
p173
aVto step up and be better role models
p174
aVfor the women and girls in our own lives.
p175
aVChallenging the status quo of how
p176
aVwomen are seen and talked about in our own circles.
p177
aa(lp178
VIt is not okay that we judge the contribution
p179
aVof our politicians by their haircuts
p180
aVor the size of their breasts,
p181
aVor to infer that the determination or the success
p182
aVof an Olympian is down  to her not being a looker.
p183
aVWe need to start judging people by what they do,
p184
aVnot what they look like.
p185
aa(lp186
VWe can all start by taking responsibility  for the types of pictures
p187
aVand comments that we post
p188
aVon our own social networks.
p189
aVWe can compliment people based on  their effort
p190
aVand their actions
p191
aVand not on their appearance.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd let me ask you,
p194
aVwhen was the last time that you
p195
aVkissed a mirror?
p196
aVUltimately, we need to work together
p197
aVas communities, as governments
p198
aVand as businesses to really change this culture of ours
p199
aVso that our kids grow up valuing their  whole selves,
p200
aVvaluing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
p201
aVWe need to put the people that are making a real difference
p202
aVon our pedestals, making a difference
p203
aVin the real world.
p204
aVGiving them the airtime, because only then
p205
aVwill we create a different world.
p206
aVA world where our kids are free to become
p207
aVthe best versions of themselves,
p208
aVwhere the way they think they look
p209
aVnever holds them back from being who they are
p210
aVor achieving what they want in life.
p211
aa(lp212
VThink about what this might mean  for someone in your life.
p213
aVWho have you got in mind?
p214
aVIs it your wife?
p215
aVYour sister?
p216
aVYour daughter?
p217
aVYour niece?
p218
aVYour friend? It could just be the woman  a couple of seats away
p219
aVfrom you today.
p220
aVWhat would it mean for her
p221
aVif she were freed from that voice
p222
aVof her inner critic, nagging her to have
p223
aVlonger legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,
p224
aVshorter feet?
p225
aVWhat could it mean for her if we overcame this
p226
aVand unlocked her potential in that way?
p227
aa(lp228
VRight now, our culture's obsession
p229
aVwith image is holding us all back.
p230
aVBut let's show our kids the truth.
p231
aVLet's show them that the way you look
p232
aVis just one part of your identity
p233
aVand that the truth is we love them
p234
aVfor who they are
p235
aVand what they do
p236
aVand how they make us feel.
p237
aVLet's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.
p238
aVLet's each and every one of us change the way
p239
aVwe talk and compare ourselves to other people.
p240
aVAnd let's work together as communities,
p241
aVfrom grassroots to governments,
p242
aVso that the happy little one-year-olds
p243
aVof today become the confident
p244
aVchangemakers of tomorrow.
p245
aVLet's do this.
