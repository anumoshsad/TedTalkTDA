(lp3
VSo I'm going to talk about work;
p4
aVspecifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work,
p5
aVwhich is a problem we all kind of have.
p6
aVBut let's sort of start at the beginning.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo, we have companies and non-profits and charities
p9
aVand all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort.
p10
aVAnd they expect these people who work for them
p11
aVto do great work \u2014
p12
aVI would hope, at least.
p13
aVAt least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work \u2014
p14
aVhopefully great work.
p15
aVAnd so what they typically do is they decide
p16
aVthat all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.
p17
aVSo a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind,
p18
aVunless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that \u2014
p19
aVmost people have to go to an office every day.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd so these companies,
p22
aVthey build offices.
p23
aVThey go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building,
p24
aVor they lease some space,
p25
aVand they fill this space with stuff.
p26
aVThey fill it with tables, or desks,
p27
aVchairs, computer equipment,
p28
aVsoftware, Internet access,
p29
aVmaybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,
p30
aVand they expect their employees, or their volunteers,
p31
aVto come to that location every day to do great work.
p32
aVIt seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that.
p33
aa(lp34
VHowever, if you actually talk to people
p35
aVand even question yourself, and you ask yourself,
p36
aVwhere do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?
p37
aVYou'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say.
p38
aVIf you ask people the question:
p39
aVWhere do you need to go when you need to get something done?
p40
aVTypically, you get three different kinds of answers.
p41
aVOne is kind of a place or a location or a room.
p42
aVAnother one is a moving object,
p43
aVand a third is a time.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo here are some examples.
p46
aVI've been asking people this question for about 10 years:
p47
aV"Where do you go when you really need to get something done?"
p48
aVI'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen.
p49
aVI'll hear things like an extra room in the house,
p50
aVthe basement,
p51
aVthe coffee shop, the library.
p52
aVAnd then you'll hear things like the train,
p53
aVa plane, a car \u2014 so, the commute.
p54
aVAnd then you'll hear people say,
p55
aV"Well, it doesn't really matter where I am,
p56
aVas long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends."
p57
aVYou almost never hear someone say, "The office."
p58
aVBut businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office,
p59
aVand they're making people go to it all the time,
p60
aVyet people don't do work in the office.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhat is that about?
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VWhy is that? Why is that happening?
p67
aVAnd what you find out is,
p68
aVif you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people \u2014
p69
aVthis is what happens:
p70
aVPeople go to work,
p71
aVand they're basically trading in their work day
p72
aVfor a series of "work moments" \u2014 that's what happens at the office.
p73
aVYou don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments.
p74
aVIt's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart,
p75
aVand you walk in and your day is shredded to bits,
p76
aVbecause you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there,
p77
aVand something else happens, you're pulled off your work,
p78
aVthen you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ...
p79
aVThen you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question,
p80
aVand before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,
p81
aVand you look back on the day,
p82
aVand you realize that you didn't get anything done.
p83
aVWe've all been through this.
p84
aVWe probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that.
p85
aVYou look back on your day,
p86
aVand you're like, "I got nothing done today.
p87
aVI was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer.
p88
aVI used the software they told me to use.
p89
aVI went to these meetings I was asked to go to.
p90
aVI did these conference calls. I did all this stuff.
p91
aVBut I didn't actually do anything.
p92
aVI just did tasks.
p93
aVI didn't actually get meaningful work done."
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd what you find is that, especially with creative people \u2014
p96
aVdesigners, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers \u2014
p97
aVthat people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time
p98
aVto get something done.
p99
aVYou cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes
p100
aVand really think about a problem.
p101
aVYou might have a quick idea,
p102
aVbut to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully,
p103
aVyou need long stretches of uninterrupted time.
p104
aVAnd even though the work day is typically eight hours,
p105
aVhow many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office?
p106
aVHow about seven hours?
p107
aVSix? Five? Four?
p108
aVWhen's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?
p109
aVTwo hours? One, maybe?
p110
aVVery, very few people actually have
p111
aVlong stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.
p112
aVAnd this is why people choose to do work at home,
p113
aVor they might go to the office,
p114
aVbut they might go to the office really early in the day,
p115
aVor late at night when no one's around,
p116
aVor they stick around after everyone's left,
p117
aVor go in on the weekends,
p118
aVor they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train,
p119
aVbecause there are no distractions.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow there are different kinds of distractions,
p122
aVbut not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute.
p123
aVAnd this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done
p124
aVreminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted,
p125
aVand that is sleep.
p126
aVI think that sleep and work are very closely related \u2014
p127
aVnot because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working.
p128
aVThat's not really what I mean.
p129
aVI'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based,
p130
aVor stage-based, events.
p131
aVSleep is about sleep phases, or stages \u2014 some people call them different things.
p132
aVThere are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones,
p133
aVthe meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones.
p134
aVIf you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones \u2014
p135
aVif someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens \u2014
p136
aVyou don't just pick up where you left off.
p137
aa(lp138
VIf you're interrupted and woken up,
p139
aVyou have to start again.
p140
aVSo you have to go back a few phases and start again.
p141
aVAnd what ends up happening \u2014 you might have days like this
p142
aVwhere you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up,
p143
aVand you're like, "I didn't sleep very well.
p144
aVI did the sleep thing \u2014 I went to bed, I laid down,
p145
aVbut I didn't really sleep."
p146
aVPeople say you go "to" sleep,
p147
aVbut you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while.
p148
aVYou've got to go through phases and stuff,
p149
aVand if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.
p150
aVSo does anyone here expect someone to sleep well
p151
aVif they're interrupted all night?
p152
aVI don't think anyone would say yes.
p153
aVWhy do we expect people to work well
p154
aVif they're being interrupted all day at the office?
p155
aVHow can we possibly expect people to do their job
p156
aVif they go to the office and are interrupted?
p157
aVThat doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places?
p160
aVBecause in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV,
p161
aVor you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs,
p162
aVor you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do.
p163
aVIf you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you
p164
aVthat they don't want their employees to work at home
p165
aVbecause of these distractions.
p166
aVThey'll sometimes also say,
p167
aV"If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?"
p168
aVwhich is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give.
p169
aVAnd I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes.
p170
aVWe all have to improve on this sort of thing.
p171
aVBut oftentimes they'll cite distractions:
p172
aV"I can't let someone work at home.
p173
aVThey'll watch TV, or do this other thing."
p174
aVIt turns out those aren't the things that are distracting,
p175
aVBecause those are voluntary distractions.
p176
aVYou decide when you want to be distracted by the TV,
p177
aVwhen you want to turn something on,
p178
aVor when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
p179
aVAt the office,
p180
aVmost of the interruptions and distractions
p181
aVthat really cause people not to get work done are involuntary.
p182
aVSo let's go through a couple of those.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, managers and bosses will often have you think
p185
aVthat the real distractions at work
p186
aVare things like Facebook and Twitter
p187
aVand YouTube and other websites,
p188
aVand in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work.
p189
aVSome of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites.
p190
aVI mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here?
p191
aVYou can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem?
p192
aVThat's why people aren't getting work done,
p193
aVbecause they're on Facebook and Twitter?
p194
aVThat's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy.
p195
aVToday's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,
p196
aVthese things are just modern-day smoke breaks.
p197
aVNo one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,
p198
aVso why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook
p199
aVor Twitter or YouTube here and there?
p200
aVThose aren't the real problems in the office.
p201
aa(lp202
VThe real problems are what I like to call the M&Ms,
p203
aVthe Managers and the Meetings.
p204
aVThose are the real problems in the modern office today.
p205
aVAnd this is why things don't get done at work,
p206
aVit's because of the M&Ms.
p207
aVNow what's interesting is,
p208
aVif you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work,
p209
aVlike at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning,
p210
aVyou don't find managers and meetings.
p211
aVYou find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings.
p212
aVSo these are the things that you don't find elsewhere,
p213
aVbut you do find at the office.
p214
aVAnd managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people.
p215
aVThat's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people.
p216
aVThey don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work,
p217
aVwhich is an interruption.
p218
aVWe have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world,
p219
aVand a lot of interruptions by these managers.
p220
aVThey have to check in: "Hey, how's it going?
p221
aVShow me what's up." This sort of thing.
p222
aVThey keep interrupting you at the wrong time,
p223
aVwhile you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do,
p224
aVthey tend to interrupt you.
p225
aVThat's kind of bad.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all,
p228
aVwhich is call meetings.
p229
aVAnd meetings are just toxic,
p230
aVterrible, poisonous things
p231
aVduring the day at work.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VWe all know this to be true,
p236
aVand you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees.
p237
aVIt doesn't work that way.
p238
aVThe manager calls the meeting
p239
aVso the employees can all come together,
p240
aVand it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people \u2014
p241
aVto say, "Hey look,
p242
aVwe're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting.
p243
aVI don't care what you're doing,
p244
aVyou've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting."
p245
aVI mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop?
p246
aVWhat if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work?
p247
aVAll of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else.
p248
aVSo they go into a meeting room, they get together,
p249
aVand they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually.
p250
aVBecause meetings aren't work.
p251
aVMeetings are places to go to talk about things
p252
aVyou're supposed to be doing later.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut meetings also procreate.
p255
aVSo one meeting tends to lead to another meeting,
p256
aVwhich leads to another meeting.
p257
aVThere's often too many people in the meetings,
p258
aVand they're very, very expensive to the organization.
p259
aVCompanies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting,
p260
aVbut that's not true, unless there's only one person.
p261
aVIf there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting.
p262
aVIt's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization
p263
aVto have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled
p264
aVby two or three people talking for a few minutes.
p265
aVBut instead, there's a long scheduled meeting,
p266
aVbecause meetings are scheduled the way software works,
p267
aVwhich is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour.
p268
aVYou don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't.
p269
aVYou can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.
p270
aVAnd so we tend to fill these times up
p271
aVwhen things should go really quickly.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today,
p274
aVespecially at offices.
p275
aVThese things don't exist outside of the office.
p276
aVSo I have some suggestions to remedy the situation.
p277
aVWhat can managers do \u2014
p278
aVenlightened managers, hopefully \u2014
p279
aVwhat can they do to make the office a better place for people to work,
p280
aVso it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort,
p281
aVso that people start to say,
p282
aV"When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office."
p283
aVBecause the offices are well-equipped;
p284
aVeverything is there for them to do the work.
p285
aVBut they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that?
p286
aVI have three suggestions to share with you.
p287
aVI have about three minutes, so that'll fit perfectly.
p288
aa(lp289
VWe've all heard of the Casual Friday thing.
p290
aVI don't know if people still do that.
p291
aVBut how about "No-talk Thursdays?"
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VPick one Thursday once a month,
p296
aVand cut it in half, just the afternoon \u2014 I'll make it easy for you.
p297
aVSo just the afternoon, one Thursday.
p298
aVFirst Thursday of the month, just the afternoon,
p299
aVnobody in the office can talk to each other.
p300
aVJust silence, that's it.
p301
aVAnd what you'll find
p302
aVis that a tremendous amount of work gets done
p303
aVwhen no one talks to each other.
p304
aVThis is when people actually get stuff done,
p305
aVis when no one's bothering them or interrupting them.
p306
aVGiving someone four hours of uninterrupted time
p307
aVis the best gift you can give anybody at work.
p308
aVIt's better than a computer,
p309
aVbetter than a new monitor, better than new software,
p310
aVor whatever people typically use.
p311
aVGiving them four hours of quiet time at the office
p312
aVis going to be incredibly valuable.
p313
aVIf you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often.
p314
aVSo maybe it's every other week,
p315
aVor every week, once a week,
p316
aVafternoons no one can talk to each other.
p317
aVThat's something that you'll find will really, really work.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnother thing you can try,
p320
aVis switching from active communication and collaboration,
p321
aVwhich is like face-to-face stuff \u2014 tapping people on the shoulder,
p322
aVsaying hi to them, having meetings,
p323
aVand replace that with more passive models of communication,
p324
aVusing things like email and instant messaging,
p325
aVor collaboration products, things like that.
p326
aVNow some people might say email is really distracting,
p327
aVI.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting,
p328
aVbut they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing.
p329
aVYou can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss.
p330
aVYou can quit I.M.;
p331
aVyou can't hide your manager.
p332
aVYou can put these things away,
p333
aVand then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time,
p334
aVwhen you're available, when you're ready to go again.
p335
aVBecause work, like sleep, happens in phases.
p336
aVSo you'll be going up, doing some work,
p337
aVand then you'll come down from that work,
p338
aVand then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M.
p339
aVThere are very, very few things that are that urgent,
p340
aVthat need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.
p341
aVSo if you're a manager,
p342
aVstart encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email
p343
aVand other things that someone can put away
p344
aVand then get back to you on their own schedule.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd the last suggestion I have is that,
p347
aVif you do have a meeting coming up,
p348
aVif you have the power, just cancel it.
p349
aVJust cancel that next meeting.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VToday's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday.
p354
aVJust don't have it.
p355
aVI don't mean move it;
p356
aVI mean just erase it from memory, it's gone.
p357
aVAnd you'll find out that everything will be just fine.
p358
aVAll these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make
p359
aVat this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,
p360
aVjust forget about them, and things will be fine.
p361
aVPeople will have a more open morning, they can actually think.
p362
aVYou'll find out all these things you thought you had to do,
p363
aVyou don't actually have to do.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about.
p366
aVI hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough
p367
aVfor managers and bosses and business owners
p368
aVand organizers and people who are in charge of other people,
p369
aVto think about laying off a little bit,
p370
aVand giving people more time to get work done.
p371
aVI think it'll all pay off in the end.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, thanks for listening.
