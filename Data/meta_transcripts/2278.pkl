VThis is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."
p4
aVIt's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel," which I did on Broadway,
p5
aVand this one, I \u2014 thank you \u2014
p6
aVI've excerpted it just for you, so here we go.
p7
aa(lp8
VRight. Class, let's be absolutely certain
p9
aVall electronic devices are switched off before we begin.
p10
aVSo class, hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the \u2014 ?
p11
aVVery good, the cellular phone announcement.
p12
aVRight? This was also known as a mobile phone.
p13
aVSo you'll remember, people of that era
p14
aVwould have had an external electronic device, right,
p15
aVsomething like this,
p16
aVand they all would have carried one of these around with them,
p17
aVand amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification
p18
aVthat one of these might ring at some inopportune moment.
p19
aVRight? So a bit of trivia about that era for you.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo the format of today's class is
p23
aVI will be presenting multiple BERT modules today
p24
aVfrom that period in history, right,
p25
aVso starting circa 2016.
p26
aVAnd remember, this was the very first year of the BERT program.
p27
aVSo we've got quite a few of these to get through.
p28
aVBear in mind, I will be living into various different bodies,
p29
aVdifferent ages,
p30
aValso what were then called races, or ethnic groups,
p31
aVas you'll remember from Unit 1.
p32
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and along the gender continuum,
p33
aVI will be living into males as well.
p34
aVIt was quite binary at that time.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVAlso, don't forget, we are reading the book module
p37
aVfor next week's focus on gender.
p38
aVNow, I know some of you have requested the book in pill form.
p39
aVI know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention,
p40
aVbut since we are trying to experience what our forebears did, right,
p41
aVlet's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading, okay?
p42
aVAnd also, how many people have your emotional shunts engaged?
p43
aVRight. Please toggle them off. Okay?
p44
aVI know it's challenging, but I want you to be able to feel the entire
p45
aVnatural emo range, all right?
p46
aVIt is essential to this part of the syllabus.
p47
aVYes, Macy?
p48
aVAll right. I understand. If you're unwilling to \u2014
p49
aVAll right, well, we can discuss that after class.
p50
aVAll right, we will discuss your concerns.
p51
aVJust relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting.
p52
aVOkay. After class. Okay? After class.
p53
aVLet's just get started, okay.
p54
aVThis first subject identified as a middle-class homemaker.
p55
aVRemember, these early modules
p56
aVin these people's full identities were protected,
p57
aVand this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic,
p58
aVwhich for many of them was taboo.
p59
aa(lp60
VOkay honey, now, I'm ready when you are.
p61
aVNo, sweetheart, I said, I'm ready when you are.
p62
aVI'm freezing.
p63
aVIt's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio.
p64
aVI should have brought a shmata.
p65
aVAll this fancy technology but they can't afford heat.
p66
aVWhat is he saying? I can't hear you!
p67
aVI can't hear you through the glass, honey!
p68
aVThere you are in my ear.
p69
aVOh, you can hear me?
p70
aVThe whole time.
p71
aVOh, yes, I am a little chilly.
p72
aVYes, oh the cold is for the machines, the new technology. Okay.
p73
aVYes, now remind me again, you're recording not only my voice but my feelings
p74
aVand my memories? Right.
p75
aVYes, BERT, yes, I read about it.
p76
aVBio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.
p77
aVRight, right, so people will be able to feel my experience
p78
aVand my memory? Okay.
p79
aVNo, right, I'm ready.
p80
aVI just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing.
p81
aVI was going to tell you you're too late, it's already bad news.
p82
aVNo, no, go ahead, honey.
p83
aa(lp84
VOh, that's the first question?
p85
aVWhat do I think of prostitution?
p86
aVAre you soliciting me, young man?
p87
aVI've heard of May-December romances, but what are you, about 20 years old?
p88
aVEighteen? Eighteen years.
p89
aVI think I have candies in my purse older than 18 years old.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVI'm teasing you, sweetheart. No, I'm comfortable with any question.
p92
aVSure. So about the prostitution \u2014 oh, sex worker, sex worker.
p93
aVNo, just in my day, they called it prostitution, not sex work.
p94
aVOh, because it includes pornography also?
p95
aVOkay.
p96
aVNo, well, I guess when I was a girl,
p97
aVwe didn't really have a name for that either.
p98
aVWe would have said dirty magazines, I suppose, or dirty movies.
p99
aVWell, it's not like what you have with the Internet.
p100
aVNo, well, I don't mind sharing.
p101
aVMy late husband and I, we were a very romantic couple.
p102
aVLots of tenderness, you understand.
p103
aVWell, as you get older, you know, at one point I thought my husband
p104
aVmight be helped by using some of the pills men can take,
p105
aVbut he wasn't interested in those,
p106
aVso I thought, what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet?
p107
aVJust for inspiration, you understand.
p108
aVWell, at the time, neither of us were very good on the computer,
p109
aVso usually, if we needed help with the Internet,
p110
aVwe would just call our children or our grandchildren,
p111
aVbut obviously, in this case, that wasn't an option,
p112
aVso I thought, I'll have a look myself, just to see.
p113
aVHow difficult could it be?
p114
aVYou search for certain key words and you look \u2014
p115
aVOh wow is right, young man.
p116
aVYou can't imagine what I saw.
p117
aVWell, first of all, I was just trying to find, you know, couples,
p118
aVnormal couples making love,
p119
aVbut this, so many people together at one time.
p120
aVYou couldn't tell which part belonged to which body.
p121
aVHow they even got the cameras to capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.
p122
aVBut the one thing they didn't capture was making love.
p123
aVThere was lots of making of something,
p124
aVbut they took the love part right out of it, you know, the fun.
p125
aVIt was all very extreme, you know?
p126
aVLike you would say, with the extreme sports.
p127
aVLots of endurance,
p128
aVbut never tenderness.
p129
aVSo anyway, needless to say, that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,
p130
aVbut it only showed up on the credit card as "entertainment services,"
p131
aVso my husband was never the wiser,
p132
aVand after all of that,
p133
aVwell, you could say it turned out
p134
aVhe didn't need the extra inspiration after all.
p135
aa(lp136
VRight, so next subject is a young woman \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p137
aVNext subject, class, is a young woman called Bella,
p138
aVa university student interviewed in 2016
p139
aVduring what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class
p140
aVas part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VYeah, I just want to, like, get a recording of, like,
p144
aVyou guys recording me,
p145
aVlike a meta recording, or whatever.
p146
aVIt's just like this whole experience is just, like, really amazing,
p147
aVand I'd like to capture that for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.
p148
aVSo, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,
p149
aVand I am, like, being interviewed right now
p150
aVfor this, like, really amazing Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,
p151
aVwhich is, like, basically where they are, like, recording, as you can see
p152
aVfrom these, whatever, like, electrodes,
p153
aVthe formation of, like, neuropeptides in my hippocampus, or whatever.
p154
aVThey will later be able to reconstitute these
p155
aVas, like, my own actual memory, like actual experiences,
p156
aVso other people can, like, actually feel what I'm feeling right now.
p157
aVOkay. Okay.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo, like, hello, BERT person of the future who is experiencing me.
p160
aVThis is what it feels like to be, like, a college freshman,
p161
aVand also the, like, headache that you are experiencing through me
p162
aVis the, like, residual effect of the Jell-O shots which I had last night
p163
aVat the bi-weekly feminist pole dancing party
p164
aVwhich I cohost on Wednesdays.
p165
aVIt's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p166
aVand it's in Beekman Hall,
p167
aVand, what else, like,
p168
aVnon-Jell-O shots are also available for vegans,
p169
aVand, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we should also focus on your questions also.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo for your record, I am, like, a sex work studies major
p172
aVbut minoring in social media
p173
aVwith a concentration on notable YouTube memes.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVYes, well, of course, like, I consider myself to be, like,
p176
aVobviously, like, a feminist.
p177
aVI was named for Bella Abzug, who was, like, a famous, like,
p178
aVfeminist from history,
p179
aVand, like, also I feel that it is, like, important to, like, represent women
p180
aVwho are, like, sex-positive feminists.
p181
aVWhat is sex-negative?
p182
aVWell, like, I guess I would ask, like, what do you think
p183
aVsex-negative is? (Laughter)
p184
aVYeah, because, like, the terms that we use are, like, so important, because, like,
p185
aVwe call it sex work because it helps people understand that, like, it's work,
p186
aVand, like, you know, just like there are, like, healthcare providers
p187
aVand, like, insurance providers,
p188
aVlike, we think of these workers as, like, sex care providers.
p189
aVYeah, but like, I don't think of myself like, providing direct
p190
aVsex care services per se as, like, being a requirement
p191
aVfor me to be, like, an advocate.
p192
aVLike, I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily, like,
p193
aVif they enjoy it.
p194
aVYeah, but, like, I see myself going forward
p195
aVas more likely, like, protecting sex workers',
p196
aVlike, legal freedoms and rights.
p197
aVYeah, so, like, basically, I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.
p198
aa(lp199
VRight, class. (Laughter) (Applause)
p200
aVSo these next two modules are also circa 2016.
p201
aVOne subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy
p202
aVrelationship to this issue,
p203
aVbut first will be a West Indian woman,
p204
aVa self-described escort
p205
aVwho was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade.
p206
aVShe was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress
p207
aVand very little else.
p208
aa(lp209
VAll right, you want me to start talking now.
p210
aVYeah, I told you, you can put those wires anywhere you want to
p211
aVas long as it don't get in the way.
p212
aVYeah, no, but, tell me again what the name of \u2014 BERT? BERT.
p213
aVYeah, I was telling you, you know, I think I have in all my time
p214
aVI have had at least one client with that name, so this won't be the first time
p215
aVI had BERT all over me.
p216
aVOh, I'm sorry,
p217
aVbut you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me.
p218
aVAll right? You can say it.
p219
aVNo justice, no piece! No justice, no piece!
p220
aVBut you see the sign? You get it? P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.
p221
aVYou understand?
p222
aa(lp223
VRight, so that's the part where I was telling you
p224
aVis that when I first came to this country, I worked every job I could find.
p225
aVI was a nanny; I was a home care attendant for all these different old people,
p226
aVand then I said, child, if I have to touch another white man's backside,
p227
aVI might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this,
p228
aVyou understand?
p229
aVPshh, you know how hard it is being a domestic worker?
p230
aVSome of these men, they're heavy.
p231
aVYou have to pick them up and flip them over.
p232
aVNow, I let them pick me up and flip me over, you understand?
p233
aVWell, you have to have a sense of humor about it, that's what I think.
p234
aVNo, but see, listen,
p235
aVyou find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job.
p236
aVI mean, there's a lot of things about this job that I hate,
p237
aVbut the money is not one of them,
p238
aVand I will tell you, as long as this is the best possibility
p239
aVfor me to make real money,
p240
aVI am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin' if that's what they want to call me.
p241
aVNo, I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me.
p242
aVMy family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands.
p243
aVThey don't know what I do, but you know what?
p244
aVMy children, they know that their school fees are paid,
p245
aVthey have their books and their computer,
p246
aVand this way, I know that they have a chance.
p247
aVSo I'm not going to tell you that what I do, it's easy,
p248
aVI'm not going to tell you that I feel \u2014 what's that you said, liberated?
p249
aVBut I'm going to tell you that I feel paid.
p250
aVRight. (Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VThanks, that's lovely, and just the cup of tea, love,
p253
aVand just a splash of the whiskey.
p254
aVIt's perfect, that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.
p255
aVWhat was your name? Peter? Is that right, so, Peter?
p256
aVRight. So that, that is the unique part of it for me,
p257
aVright, is that I ended up in both,
p258
aVfirst in the convent, and then in the prostitution after. That's right.
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVSo one woman at the university here in Dublin, she wrote about me.
p261
aVShe said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.
p262
aVRight? (Laughter)
p263
aVDoesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital?
p264
aVWell, I've got this terrible dichotomy.
p265
aVDoesn't it.
p266
aa(lp267
VRight. Well, for me though, it was, as a girl, it started with me dad.
p268
aVI mean, half the time, when he spoke to us, it was just a sort of
p269
aVtell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals, that type of thing.
p270
aVAnd I certainly didn't do myself any favors.
p271
aVBy the time I was 16,
p272
aVI had started messing about with this older fella,
p273
aVand he wanted it to be our little secret,
p274
aVand I did as I was told, didn't I,
p275
aVand when that got back to me dad, he had me sent straightaway to the convent.
p276
aVWell no, that older fella, he would still come to find me in the convent.
p277
aVYeah, he'd leave me notes
p278
aVtucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop
p279
aVso we could meet.
p280
aVAnd he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife,
p281
aVand I believed him, until I got pregnant.
p282
aVI did, Peter, and I left him a note about it in our special place there,
p283
aVand I never did hear from him again.
p284
aVNo, I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life,
p285
aVand then they wouldn't let me back into the convent.
p286
aa(lp287
VNo, my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin,
p288
aVand that's how I ended up here.
p289
aVWell, surprise, surprise, I fell in love with another fella much older than me,
p290
aVand I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink,
p291
aVI married the bastard.
p292
aa(lp293
VWell, he didn't drink, but he did have just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,
p294
aVand \u2014 That's right, and before I knew it,
p295
aVhe was the one who turned me on to the prostitution, my own husband.
p296
aVHe had me supporting the both of us.
p297
aVI was 18.
p298
aVWell, it wasn't Pretty Woman, I can tell you that.
p299
aVThat Julia Roberts,
p300
aVif she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket,
p301
aVI don't think she'd ever have made that film.
p302
aVWell, for your record,
p303
aVmy opinion of the legalization, I'd say I'm against it.
p304
aVI just, I don't care what these young girls say.
p305
aVYou know, living like that, you're just lost,
p306
aVand, you know, I'm 63 years old.
p307
aVI'm still trying to find who I am.
p308
aVYou know, I never was a wife or a nun,
p309
aVor a prostitute even, really, not really.
p310
aVNobody ever asked who I wanted to be.
p311
aVThey just told me,
p312
aVand if you legalize it,
p313
aVthen you're really telling these girls, "Go on and get lost for a living,"
p314
aVand a lot of them, they'll do as they're told.
p315
aa(lp316
VAll right, so four perspectives from four quite \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p317
aVfour quite different voices there, right?
p318
aVOne woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to
p319
aVmechanize or industrialize it.
p320
aVThen the second woman considered sex work to be empowering,
p321
aVliberating, and feminist, though she, herself, notably,
p322
aVdid not seem keen to do it.
p323
aVThe third woman, who actually was a so-called sex worker
p324
aVdid not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right
p325
aVto the economic empowerment,
p326
aVand then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself
p327
aVbut proscribed roles for women in general
p328
aVprevented her from ever finding who she was, right?
p329
aa(lp330
VSo another fact most people did not know
p331
aVwas the average age of an at-risk girl being introduced to the sex industry
p332
aVwas 12 or 13.
p333
aa(lp334
VAlso consider that the age when all girls in that society
p335
aVfirst became exposed to sexualized images of women
p336
aVwas quite a bit earlier, right?
p337
aVThis was a doll called Barbie, right?
p338
aVI initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention \u2014
p339
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p340
aVbut actually she was considered by many
p341
aVto be a wholesome symbol of femininity,
p342
aVand often young girls began what was called dieting.
p343
aVRemember this? This was restricting food intake on purpose
p344
aVby the age of six,
p345
aVand defining themselves based on attractiveness
p346
aVby around that same time. Right?
p347
aa(lp348
VYes?
p349
aVRight, Bradley, okay, excellent point.
p350
aVSo there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people
p351
aVthey had to look a certain way to even have a sex life, right?
p352
aVBut girls, especially, were expected to be "sexy" while avoiding
p353
aVbeing perceived as "sluts" for being sexual. Right?
p354
aVSo there's that shame piece we've heard about.
p355
aa(lp356
VYes.
p357
aVValerie, right? Okay, very good.
p358
aVOf course, men were having sex as well,
p359
aVbut you'll remember from the reading,
p360
aVwhat were male sluts called?
p361
aVVery good, they were called men.
p362
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p363
aVSo not easy living in a world like that, right?
p364
aVThough it was not all bad news either.
p365
aVMost women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered,
p366
aVand men generally felt they were also evolved in this area,
p367
aVand, in fact, most people would have been aware of issues
p368
aVlike human trafficking, for example,
p369
aVbut they would have seen that as quite separate
p370
aVfrom more recreational adult entertainment.
p371
aVAnd so we'll just very briefly, class \u2014 we don't have a lot of time \u2014
p372
aVwe'll just very briefly hear from a man
p373
aVon our topic at this stage.
p374
aVSo this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party.
p375
aa(lp376
VDude, can you, all right, can you just keep it down?
p377
aVI'm trying to talk to BERT right now.
p378
aVOh, your name's not BERT.
p379
aVBERT's the name of the, oh, all right.
p380
aVNo, no, no, totally, it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober,
p381
aVso I just want to be helpful.
p382
aVYeah, and I totally believe in causes, yeah, like, all that stuff.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVAnd actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.
p385
aVYeah, Toms, like, the shoes,
p386
aVlike, you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water.
p387
aVYeah. Totally.
p388
aVBut what was the question again? Sorry.
p389
aa(lp390
VOf course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman.
p391
aV(Laughter)
p392
aVNo, but I mean, like, just because I'm in a strip club parking lot
p393
aVdoesn't mean that I'm, like, a sexist or whatever.
p394
aVMy fiancee is totally amazing, she's totally a strong girl, woman,
p395
aVsmart woman, like, the whole thing.
p396
aa(lp397
VYeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now,
p398
aVlike, as a joke, same as me.
p399
aa(lp400
VMy best man, I told him he could surprise me,
p401
aVand he thought this would be hilarious,
p402
aVbut this is not something.
p403
aVYeah, we all went to B school together.
p404
aVWharton.
p405
aV(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VYeah, so, dude, can you guys \u2014
p408
aVAll right, but it's my bachelor party,
p409
aVand I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to.
p410
aVAll right, I'll see you in there.
p411
aa(lp412
VAll right, okay, so Anderson,
p413
aVso, like, first of all, stripping,
p414
aVbut then, like, all the other things you're talking about,
p415
aVprostitution and all that stuff, that's, like, not the same thing at all.
p416
aVYou know? Like, you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever,
p417
aVbut it's like, if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer
p418
aVand she's 18, like, that's her right.
p419
aa(lp420
VWhoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying, but I just feel like people,
p421
aVthey just want to make it seem like all dudes are just, like, predators,
p422
aVthat we would just automatically go to a prostitute, or whatever.
p423
aVEven, like, when I pledged, you know, like when I rushed my fraternity.
p424
aVMy brothers who I'm close to, those guys, they're all like me.
p425
aVWe're just normal people, but, like, there's this myth that you must
p426
aVbe that guy who is kind of an asshole, and like, all bros before hos or whatever.
p427
aVAnd actually, like, bros before hos, it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.
p428
aVIt's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers
p429
aVand you put them first.
p430
aa(lp431
VYeah, but, you can't blame the media, either.
p432
aVI mean, like, if you go watch "Hangover 2,"
p433
aVand you think that's an instruction manual
p434
aVfor your life, like, I don't know what to tell you.
p435
aVYou know? You don't watch "Bourne Identity"
p436
aVand go drive your car over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)
p437
aa(lp438
VWell, yeah, okay, like, if you're a little kid or whatever,
p439
aVof course it's different, but \u2014
p440
aa(lp441
VYeah, all right, I remember one thing like that.
p442
aVI was at this kid's house one time playing GTA,
p443
aVuh, Grand Theft Auto?
p444
aa(lp445
VDude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)
p446
aa(lp447
VSo, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,
p448
aVyou're this kid, like, you're this guy walking around or whatever,
p449
aVand you can basically, like, the more cops you kill,
p450
aVthe more points you get, and stuff like that.
p451
aVBut also, you can find prostitutes
p452
aVand obviously you can do sexual stuff with them,
p453
aVbut you can, like, kill them and take your money back.
p454
aVYeah, this kid, I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car
p455
aVand he got all these points.
p456
aVWe were, like, 10, I think.
p457
aVIt felt pretty terrible, actually.
p458
aVNo, I don't think I said anything, I just finished playing and went home.
p459
aa(lp460
VAll right class, so then there were men who had more than just
p461
aVa passing relationship to this issue. (Laughter)
p462
aVThe next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp
p463
aVturned motivational speaker,
p464
aVlife coach and therapist,
p465
aVbut if you want to know more about him, you'll have to come to the entire play.
p466
aa(lp467
VThank you so much, you beautiful TED audience.
p468
aVI will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."
