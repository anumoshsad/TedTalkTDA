VI'm going to talk to you today about
p4
aVhopefully converting fear into hope.
p5
aVWhen we go to the physician today \u2014
p6
aVwhen we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
p7
aVthere are words that we just don't want to hear.
p8
aVThere are words that we're truly afraid of.
p9
aVDiabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
p10
aVheart failure, lung failure \u2014
p11
aVthings that we know are debilitating diseases,
p12
aVfor which there's relatively little that can be done.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd what I want to lay out for you today is
p15
aVa different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
p16
aVwhy it's important,
p17
aVwhy without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
p18
aVif you think it already hasn't,
p19
aVand where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
p20
aVand what some of the hurdles are.
p21
aVAnd we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
p22
aa(lp23
VI want to start with this slide,
p24
aVbecause this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
p25
aVThis was an issue from 2002
p26
aVthat they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
p27
aVIt was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
p28
aVRegenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
p29
aVthat everybody can understand.
p30
aVIt's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
p31
aVto a clinically relevant timescale.
p32
aVSo we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
p33
aVWe know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
p34
aVAnd this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
p37
aVThis is not regenerative medicine.
p38
aVRegenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
p39
aVwhen they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
p40
aVThe idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
p41
aVwith devices and drugs and the like \u2014
p42
aVand I'll come back to that theme a few times \u2014
p43
aVinstead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
p44
aVby regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
p45
aVSo that at the end of the treatment,
p46
aVyou are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
p47
aa(lp48
VVery few good ideas \u2014 if you agree that this is a good idea \u2014
p49
aVvery few good ideas are truly novel.
p50
aVAnd this is just the same.
p51
aVIf you look back in history,
p52
aVCharles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
p53
aVwas actually one of the first people
p54
aValong with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
p55
aVto begin to think about, could you culture organs?
p56
aVAnd they published this book in 1937,
p57
aVwhere they actually began to think about,
p58
aVwhat could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
p59
aVWe've come a long way since then.
p60
aVI'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut before doing that, what I'd like to do
p63
aVis share my depression about the health care system
p64
aVand the need for this with you.
p65
aVMany of the talks yesterday talked about
p66
aVimproving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
p67
aVand essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
p68
aVOne of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
p69
aVAnd the longer we live, the more expensive it is
p70
aVto take care of our diseases as we get older.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is simply the wealth of a country
p73
aVversus the percent of population over the age of 65.
p74
aVAnd you can basically see that the richer a country is,
p75
aVthe older the people are within it.
p76
aVWhy is this important?
p77
aVAnd why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
p78
aVIf the average age of your population is 30,
p79
aVthen the average kind of disease that you have to treat
p80
aVis maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
p81
aVmaybe a little bit of asthma.
p82
aVIf the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
p83
aVnow the average person is looking at diabetes,
p84
aVearly-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease \u2014
p85
aVthings that are inherently more difficult to treat,
p86
aVand much more expensive to treat.
p87
aa(lp88
VJust have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
p89
aVThis is from "The Untied States of America."
p90
aVIn 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
p91
aV41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
p92
aVpaying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
p93
aVIn 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
p94
aVAnd this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
p95
aVHow can you actually afford to treat patients
p96
aVwhen the reality of getting old looks like this?
p97
aa(lp98
VThis is age versus cost of health care.
p99
aVAnd you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
p100
aVthere's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
p101
aVIt's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
p102
aVyou can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
p103
aVplotted over your lifetime.
p104
aVAnd about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
p105
aVAnd you can actually \u2014
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aV\u2014 we won't get into that.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThere are very few things, very few things that you can really do
p111
aVthat will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
p112
aVand experience what I would call healthy aging.
p113
aVI'd suggest there are four things,
p114
aVand none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
p115
aVAll those things do is change who pays.
p116
aVThey don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
p117
aa(lp118
VOne thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
p119
aVWe won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
p120
aVYou can prevent.
p121
aVObviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
p124
aVis the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
p125
aVand then treating the disease to cure the disease
p126
aVinstead of treating a symptom.
p127
aVThink of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
p128
aVToday, with diabetes, what do we do?
p129
aVWe diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
p130
aVand then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
p131
aVAnd we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
p132
aVBut eventually it stops working,
p133
aVand diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhy couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something
p136
aVto regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
p137
aVperhaps even before it was symptomatic?
p138
aVAnd it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
p139
aVbut if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
p142
aVThis is a newt re-growing its limb.
p143
aVIf a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
p144
aVI'll actually show you some more important features
p145
aVabout limb regeneration in a moment.
p146
aVBut what we're talking about in regenerative medicine
p147
aVis doing this in every organ system of the body,
p148
aVfor tissues and for organs themselves.
p149
aVSo today's reality is that if we get sick,
p150
aVthe message is we will treat your symptoms,
p151
aVand you need to adjust to a new way of life.
p152
aa(lp153
VI would pose to you that tomorrow \u2014
p154
aVand when tomorrow is we could debate,
p155
aVbut it's within the foreseeable future \u2014
p156
aVwe will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
p157
aVThere's a limb prosthetic up here,
p158
aVsimilar actually one on the soldier
p159
aVthat's come back from Iraq.
p160
aVThere are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
p161
aVImagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
p162
aVface the regeneration of that limb.
p163
aVIt's a wild concept.
p164
aVI'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
p167
aVHow can we do that?
p168
aVThe way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
p169
aVWe need to learn to speak the body's language.
p170
aVAnd to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
p171
aVA mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
p172
aVwill re-grow that limb.
p173
aVSo our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
p174
aVIt's a natural process,
p175
aVbut it is lost as we age.
p176
aVIn a child, before the age of about six months,
p177
aVif they lose their fingertip in an accident,
p178
aVthey'll re-grow their fingertip.
p179
aVBy the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo to engage in that conversation with the body,
p182
aVwe need to speak the body's language.
p183
aVAnd there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
p184
aVI'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
p185
aVthrough which to converse with the body.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe first is cellular therapies.
p188
aVClearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
p189
aVusing cells to do most of the work.
p190
aVTherefore, if we can find the right cells
p191
aVand implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
p192
aVSecondly, we can use materials.
p193
aVWe heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
p194
aVIf we can invent materials, design materials,
p195
aVor extract materials from a natural environment,
p196
aVthen we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
p197
aVAnd finally, we may be able to use smart devices
p198
aVthat will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
p199
aa(lp200
VI'm going to show you an example of each of these,
p201
aVand I'm going to start with materials.
p202
aVSteve Badylak \u2014 who's at the University of Pittsburgh \u2014
p203
aVabout a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
p204
aVAnd that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
p205
aVif you threw away all the cells,
p206
aVand if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
p207
aVmay contain all of the necessary factors and signals
p208
aVthat would signal the body to heal itself.
p209
aVAnd he asked a very important question.
p210
aVHe asked the question,
p211
aVif I take that material, which is a natural material
p212
aVthat usually induces healing in the small intestine,
p213
aVand I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
p214
aVwould it give a tissue-specific response,
p215
aVor would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
p216
aa(lp217
VI wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
p218
aVThe picture I'm about to show you
p219
aVis a compelling picture.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVHowever, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish \u2014
p222
aVeven though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends \u2014
p223
aVthe lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
p224
aVcheck your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VWhat I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
p228
aVAnd although \u2014 it's good to laugh before we look at this.
p229
aVThis is the reality of diabetes.
p230
aVI think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
p231
aVwe just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
p232
aVwhich is amputation, if you can't heal it.
p233
aVSo I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
p234
aVThis is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
p235
aVThe treatment for this is amputation.
p236
aVThis is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
p237
aVand has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,
p240
aVthat she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
p241
aVThat's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
p242
aVThat material contained only natural signals.
p243
aVAnd that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
p244
aVthat it didn't have before.
p245
aa(lp246
VThere's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you \u2014
p247
aVI'll let you know when you can look again.
p248
aVThis is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
p249
aVIf the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
p250
aVThe horse just has another nostril that's developed
p251
aVbecause of a riding accident.
p252
aVJust a few weeks after treatment \u2014
p253
aVin this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
p254
aVand packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times \u2014
p255
aVand the horse heals up.
p256
aVAnd if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
p257
aa(lp258
VHere's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
p259
aVThere are now 400,000 patients around the world
p260
aVwho have used that material to heal their wounds.
p261
aVCould you regenerate a limb?
p262
aVDARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
p263
aVto begin the process of asking that question.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
p266
aVThis is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
p267
aVRemember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
p268
aVAfter treatment that's what it looks like.
p269
aVThis is happening today.
p270
aVThis is clinically relevant today.
p271
aVThere are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
p272
aa(lp273
VBut could you go a little further?
p274
aVCould you, say, instead of using material,
p275
aVcan I take some cells along with the material,
p276
aVand remove a damaged piece of tissue,
p277
aVput a bio-degradable material on there?
p278
aVYou can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
p279
aVThis was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
p280
aVHe can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
p281
aVHe chills the dish, it changes its properties
p282
aVand he peels it right out of the dish.
p283
aVIt's the coolest stuff.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
p286
aVAnd what I'm going to show you here
p287
aVis stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
p288
aVAgain, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
p289
aVBut this one's kind of cool.
p290
aVSo this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
p291
aVwith a difference.
p292
aVIn this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
p293
aVyou're going to see the stem cells from the patient
p294
aVthat were removed at the beginning of the procedure
p295
aVbeing injected directly into the heart of the patient.
p296
aVAnd I'm standing up here because at one point
p297
aVI'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
p298
aVHere go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
p299
aVAnd if you look really carefully,
p300
aVit's going to be right around this point
p301
aVyou'll actually see a back-flush.
p302
aVYou see the cells coming back out.
p303
aVWe need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
p304
aVto get the cells to the right place at the right time.
p305
aa(lp306
VJust a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
p307
aVThis was a randomized trial.
p308
aVAt this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
p309
aVBasically, if you take an extremely sick patient
p310
aVand you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
p311
aVIf you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
p312
aVfor these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
p313
aVThese are now two years out.
p314
aVThe coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
p315
aVand prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
p316
aa(lp317
VThis is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,
p318
aVwith only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
p319
aVand simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
p320
aVThere go the cells.
p321
aVWe don't have time to go into all of those details,
p322
aVbut basically, that works too.
p323
aVYou can take patients who are less sick,
p324
aVand bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
p325
aVthrough that kind of therapy.
p326
aa(lp327
VHere's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,
p328
aVbut I think very soon will be.
p329
aVThis is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
p330
aValong with a number of colleagues around the world.
p331
aVThey've decided that liposuction fluid,
p332
aVwhich \u2014 in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVIt's a great source of stem cells.
p335
aVStem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
p336
aVSo you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
p337
aVOut comes the liposuction fluid,
p338
aVand in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
p339
aVAll done in the lab.
p340
aVAnd I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
p341
aVwith their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
p342
aa(lp343
VI talked before about the use of devices
p344
aVto dramatically change the way we treat disease.
p345
aVHere's just one example before I close up.
p346
aVThis is equally tragic.
p347
aVWe have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership
p348
aVwith our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
p349
aVwho have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
p350
aVMany of those patients are very severely burned.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd if there's anything that's been learned about burn,
p353
aVit's that we don't know how to treat it.
p354
aVEverything that is done to treat burn \u2014
p355
aVbasically we do a sodding approach.
p356
aVWe make something over here,
p357
aVand then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
p358
aVand we try and get the two to take.
p359
aVIn this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed \u2014
p360
aVit should be tested clinically later this year at ISR \u2014
p361
aVby Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
p362
aVAnd that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
p363
aVThe gun that you see there sprays cells.
p364
aVThat's going to spray cells over that area.
p365
aVThe reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,
p366
aVdeliver other things as well at the same time,
p367
aVand therefore we will seed that lawn,
p368
aVas opposed to try the sodding approach.
p369
aVIt's a completely different way of doing it.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo my 18 minutes is up.
p372
aVSo let me finish up with some good news,
p373
aVand maybe a little bit of bad news.
p374
aVThe good news is that this is happening today.
p375
aVIt's very powerful work.
p376
aVClearly the images kind of get that across.
p377
aVIt's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
p378
aVAlmost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
p379
aVis involved in trying to get this to happen.
p380
aa(lp381
VA number of governments, and a number of regions,
p382
aVhave recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
p383
aVThe Japanese government were perhaps the first,
p384
aVwhen they decided to invest first 3 billion,
p385
aVlater another 2 billion in this field.
p386
aVIt's no coincidence.
p387
aVJapan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
p388
aVThey need this to work or their health system dies.
p389
aVSo they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
p390
aVThe European Union, same thing.
p391
aVChina, the same thing.
p392
aVChina just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
p393
aVThe first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
p394
aa(lp395
VIn the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
p396
aV(Laughter)
p397
aVOh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
p398
aVWe've had a different approach.
p399
aVAnd the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
p400
aVBut there's been no strategic investment
p401
aVto bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
p404
aVat the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
p405
aVMyself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
p406
aVwent to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
p407
aVjust a few months ago,
p408
aVto try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
p409
aVof that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
p410
aVand focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
p411
aVat which these things get to patients.
p412
aVAnd at the end of a very testy meeting,
p413
aVwhat the NIH director said was,
p414
aV"Your vision is larger than our appetite."
p415
aVI'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,
