VThe philosopher Plato once said,
p4
aV"Music gives a soul to the universe,
p5
aVwings to the mind,
p6
aVflight to the imagination
p7
aVand life to everything."
p8
aVMusic has always been a big part of my life.
p9
aVTo create and to perform music
p10
aVconnects you to people countries and lifetimes away.
p11
aVIt connects you to the people you're playing with,
p12
aVto your audience
p13
aVand to yourself.
p14
aVWhen I'm happy, when I'm sad,
p15
aVwhen I'm bored, when I'm stressed,
p16
aVI listen to and I create music.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen I was younger, I played piano;
p19
aVlater, I took up guitar.
p20
aVAnd as I started high school,
p21
aVmusic became a part of my identity.
p22
aVI was in every band,
p23
aVI was involved with every musical fine arts event.
p24
aVMusic surrounded me.
p25
aVIt made me who I was,
p26
aVand it gave me a place to belong.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, I've always had this thing with rhythms.
p29
aVI remember being young,
p30
aVI would walk down the hallways of my school
p31
aVand I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my hands,
p32
aVor tapping my teeth.
p33
aVIt was a nervous habit,
p34
aVand I was always nervous.
p35
aVI think I liked the repetition of the rhythm \u2014
p36
aVit was calming.
p37
aa(lp38
VThen in high school,
p39
aVI started music theory,
p40
aVand it was the best class I've ever taken.
p41
aVWe were learning about music \u2014
p42
aVthings I didn't know, like theory and history.
p43
aVIt was a class where we basically just listened to a song,
p44
aVtalked about what it meant to us
p45
aVand analyzed it,
p46
aVand figured out what made it tick.
p47
aVEvery Wednesday, we did something called "rhythmic dictation,"
p48
aVand I was pretty good at it.
p49
aVOur teacher would give us an amount of measures
p50
aVand a time signature,
p51
aVand then he would speak a rhythm to us
p52
aVand we would have to write it down with the proper rests and notes.
p53
aVLike this:
p54
aVta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,
p55
aVta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.
p56
aVAnd I loved it.
p57
aVThe simplicity of the rhythm \u2014
p58
aVa basic two- to four- measure line \u2014
p59
aVand yet each of them almost told a story,
p60
aVlike they had so much potential,
p61
aVand all you had to do was add a melody.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Guitar)
p64
aa(lp65
VRhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of.
p66
aVIt gives structure and stability.
p67
aVNow, music has these parts \u2014
p68
aVrhythm, melody and harmony \u2014
p69
aVjust like our lives.
p70
aVWhere music has rhythm,
p71
aVwe have routines and habits \u2014
p72
aVthings that help us to remember what to do and to stay on track,
p73
aVand to just keep going.
p74
aVAnd you may not notice it,
p75
aVbut it's always there.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Guitar)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd it may seem simple,
p80
aVit may seem dull by itself,
p81
aVbut it gives tempo and heartbeat.
p82
aVAnd then things in your life add on to it,
p83
aVgiving texture \u2014
p84
aVthat's your friends and your family,
p85
aVand anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life
p86
aVand in your song,
p87
aVlike harmonies,
p88
aVcadences
p89
aVand anything that makes it polyphonic.
p90
aVAnd they create beautiful chords and patterns.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Guitar)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd then there's you.
p95
aVYou play on top of everything else,
p96
aVon top of the rhythms and the beat
p97
aVbecause you're the melody.
p98
aVAnd things may change and develop,
p99
aVbut no matter what we do,
p100
aVwe're still the same people.
p101
aVThroughout a song melodies develop,
p102
aVbut it's still the same song.
p103
aVNo matter what you do,
p104
aVthe rhythms are still there:
p105
aVthe tempo and the heartbeat ...
p106
aVuntil I left,
p107
aVand I went to college
p108
aVand everything disappeared.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhen I first arrived at university,
p111
aVI felt lost.
p112
aVAnd don't get me wrong \u2014 sometimes I loved it and it was great,
p113
aVbut other times,
p114
aVI felt like I had been left alone
p115
aVto fend for myself.
p116
aVIt's like I had been taken out of my natural environment,
p117
aVand put somewhere new,
p118
aVwhere the rhythms and the harmonies
p119
aVand the form had gone away,
p120
aVand it was just me \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Guitar)
p123
aa(lp124
Vsilence and my melody.
p125
aVAnd even that began to waver,
p126
aVbecause I didn't know what I was doing.
p127
aVI didn't have any chords to structure myself,
p128
aVor a rhythm
p129
aVor a beat to know the tempo.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Guitar)
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd then I began to hear all these other sounds.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Guitar)
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd they were off-time
p138
aVand off-key.
p139
aVAnd the more I was around them,
p140
aVthe more my melody started to sound like theirs.
p141
aVAnd slowly I began to lose myself,
p142
aVlike I was being washed away.
p143
aVBut then the next moment \u2014
p144
aa(lp145
V(Guitar)
p146
aa(lp147
VI could hear it.
p148
aVAnd I could feel it.
p149
aVAnd it was me.
p150
aVAnd I was here.
p151
aVAnd it was different,
p152
aVbut not worse off.
p153
aVJust changed a little.
p154
aa(lp155
VMusic is my way of coping with the changes in my life.
p156
aVThere's a beautiful connection between music and life.
p157
aVIt can bind us to reality
p158
aVat the same time it allows us to escape it.
p159
aVMusic is something that lives inside of you.
p160
aVYou create it and you're created by it.
p161
aVOur lives are not only conducted by music,
p162
aVthey're also composed of it.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo this may seem like a bit of a stretch,
p165
aVbut hear me out:
p166
aVmusic is a fundamental part of what we are
p167
aVand of everything around us.
p168
aVNow, music is my passion,
p169
aVbut physics also used to be an interest of mine.
p170
aVAnd the more I learned,
p171
aVthe more I saw connections between the two \u2014
p172
aVespecially regarding string theory.
p173
aVI know this is only one of many theories,
p174
aVbut it spoke to me.
p175
aVSo, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest form, is this:
p176
aVmatter is made up of atoms,
p177
aVwhich are made up of protons and neutrons and electrons,
p178
aVwhich are made up of quark.
p179
aVAnd here's where the string part comes in.
p180
aVThis quark is supposedly made up of little coiled strings,
p181
aVand it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it is.
p182
aa(lp183
VMichio Kaku once explained this
p184
aVin a lecture called, "The Universe in a Nutshell,"
p185
aVwhere he says,
p186
aV"String theory is the simple idea
p187
aVthat the four forces of the universe \u2014
p188
aVgravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces \u2014
p189
aVcan be viewed as music.
p190
aVThe music of tiny little rubber bands."
p191
aVIn this lecture, he goes on to explain physics
p192
aVas the laws of harmony between these strings;
p193
aVchemistry, as the melodies you can play on these strings;
p194
aVand he states that the universe is a "symphony of strings."
p195
aVThese strings dictate the universe;
p196
aVthey make up everything we see and everything we know.
p197
aVThey're musical notes,
p198
aVbut they make us what we are and they hold us together.
p199
aVSo you see,
p200
aVeverything is music.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Guitar)
p203
aa(lp204
VWhen I look at the world,
p205
aVI see music all around us.
p206
aVWhen I look at myself,
p207
aVI see music.
p208
aVAnd my life has been defined by music.
p209
aVI found myself through music.
p210
aVMusic is everywhere,
p211
aVand it is in everything.
p212
aVAnd it changes and it builds
p213
aVand it diminishes.
p214
aVBut it's always there,
p215
aVsupporting us,
p216
aVconnecting us to each other
p217
aVand showing us the beauty of the universe.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo if you ever feel lost,
p220
aVstop and listen for your song.
p221
aa(lp222
VThank you.
