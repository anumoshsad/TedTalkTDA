p7
aVFrom the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,

VI asked a question last year:
p13
aVCan art change the world?
p14
aVWell let me tell you,
p15
aVin terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,
p16
aVbecause the Arab Spring is still spreading,
p17
aVthe Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?
p18
aVThe Occupy movement found a voice,
p19
aVand I still have to speak English constantly.
p20
aVSo there has been a lot of change.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo when I had my TED wish last year,
p23
aVI said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
p24
aVYou are going to take the photos.
p25
aVYou're going to send them to me.
p26
aVI'm going to print them and send them back to you.
p27
aVThen you're going to paste them where it makes sense
p28
aVfor you to place your own statement.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis is Inside Out.
p31
aVOne hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.
p32

p37
aa(lp38
VWhen I launched my wish last year,
p39
aVhundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.
p40
aVBut I say it has to be
p41
aVunder the conditions I've always worked:
p42
aVno credit, no logos, no sponsoring.
p43
aVA week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock
p44
aVand empower the people on the ground
p45
aVwho wanted to change the world.
p46
aVThese are the people I want to talk about to you today.
p47
aa(lp48
VTwo weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,

p52
aVBoom! This is what happened.
p53
aVSlim and his friends went through the country
p54
aVand pasted hundreds of photos everywhere
p55

VThere are tons of school projects.
p98
aVTwenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.
p99
aVEducation is so essential.
p100
aVKids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,
p101
aVthey paste them on the school.
p102
aVHere they even got the help of the firemen.
p103
aVThere should be even more schools doing this kind of project.
p104
aa(lp105
VOf course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
