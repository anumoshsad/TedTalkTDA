VA talk about surgical robots
p4
aVis also a talk about surgery.
p5
aVAnd while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,
p6
aVkeep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood
p7
aVthan normal people do,
p8
aVbecause, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,
p9
aVif it were done without consent,
p10
aVwould be a felony.
p11
aVSurgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,
p12
aVthe carpenters \u2014 some would say the butchers \u2014
p13
aVof the medical world:
p14
aVcutting, reshaping, reforming,
p15
aVbypassing, fixing.
p16
aVBut you need to talk about surgical instruments
p17
aVand the evolution of surgical technology together.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo in order to give you some kind of a perspective
p20
aVof where we are right now
p21
aVwith surgical robots,
p22
aVand where we're going to be going in the future,
p23
aVI want to give you a little bit of perspective
p24
aVof how we got to this point,
p25
aVhow we even came to believe
p26
aVthat surgery was OK,
p27
aVthat this was something that was possible to do,
p28
aVthat this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, a little bit of perspective \u2014
p31
aVabout 10,000 years of perspective.
p32
aVThis is a trephinated skull.
p33
aVAnd trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.
p34
aVAnd many, many hundreds of skulls like this
p35
aVhave been found in archaeological sites
p36
aVall over the world,
p37
aVdating back five to 10 thousand years.
p38
aVFive to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.
p39
aVYou are a healer in a Stone Age village.
p40
aVAnd you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him \u2014
p41
aVOliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.
p42
aVHe's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.
p43
aVBut you think to yourself,
p44
aV"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.
p45
aVBut maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVNow that is surgical thinking.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.
p50
aVWhat is astonishing about this is,
p51
aVeven though we don't know really how much of this
p52
aVwas intended to be religious,
p53
aVor how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,
p54
aVwhat we can tell is that these patients lived!
p55
aVJudging by the healing on the borders of these holes,
p56
aVthey lived days, months, years following trephination.
p57
aVAnd so what we are seeing is evidence
p58
aVof a refined technique
p59
aVthat was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,
p60
aVall over the world.
p61
aVThis arose independently at sites everywhere
p62
aVthat had no communication to one another.
p63
aVWe really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow we can fast forward many thousands of years
p66
aVinto the Bronze Age and beyond.
p67
aVAnd we see new refined tools coming out.
p68
aVBut surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative
p69
aVthan their bold, trephinating ancestors.
p70
aVThese guys confined their surgery
p71
aVto fairly superficial injuries.
p72
aVAnd surgeons were tradesmen,
p73
aVrather than physicians.
p74
aVThis persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.
p75
aa(lp76
VThat may have saved the writers,
p77
aVbut it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.
p78
aVThey were still a mistrusted lot.
p79
aVSurgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,
p80
aVbecause the landscape was dominated
p81
aVby the itinerant barber surgeon.
p82
aVThese were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,
p83
aVdoing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.
p84
aVBecause we were in the age before anesthesia,
p85
aVthe agony of the patient
p86
aVis really as much of the public spectacle
p87
aVas the surgery itself.
p88
aVOne of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,
p89
aVshown here doing a lithotomy \u2014
p90
aVwhich is the removal of the bladder stone,
p91
aVone of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time \u2014
p92
aVhad to take less than two minutes.
p93
aVYou had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,
p94
aVand be really, really quick.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd so here you see him doing a lithotomy.
p97
aVAnd he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,
p98
aVwandering around in Europe,
p99
aVwhich is an astonishing number,
p100
aVwhen you think that surgery must have been a last resort.
p101
aVI mean who would put themselves through that?
p102
aVUntil anesthesia, the absence of sensation.
p103
aVWith the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler
p104
aVat the Mass. General in 1847,
p105
aVa whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
p106
aVAnesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.
p107
aVAnesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,
p108
aVto start to delve deeper into the body.
p109
aVThis was truly a revolution in surgery.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut there was a pretty big problem with this.
p112
aVAfter these very long, painstaking operations,
p113
aVattempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,
p114
aVthe patients died.
p115
aVThey died of massive infection.
p116
aVSurgery didn't hurt anymore,
p117
aVbut it killed you pretty quickly.
p118
aVAnd infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients
p119
aVuntil the next big revolution in surgery,
p120
aVwhich was aseptic technique.
p121
aa(lp122
VJoseph Lister was aepsis's,
p123
aVor sterility's, biggest advocate,
p124
aVto a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.
p125
aVBut eventually they did come around.
p126
aVThe Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.
p127
aVAnd they came back to their American clinic and they said
p128
aVthey had learned it was as important to wash your hands
p129
aVbefore doing surgery
p130
aVas it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)
p131
aVSomething so simple.
p132
aVAnd yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.
p133
aa(lp134
VThese surgeries were actually now being effective.
p135
aVWith the patient insensitive to pain,
p136
aVand a sterile operating field
p137
aVall bets were off, the sky was the limit.
p138
aVYou could now start doing surgery everywhere,
p139
aVon the gut, on the liver,
p140
aVon the heart, on the brain.
p141
aVTransplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,
p142
aVyou could put it in another person, and it would work.
p143
aVSurgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;
p144
aVthey had become gods.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,
p147
aVbut at quite a cost,
p148
aVbecause they are saving lives,
p149
aVbut not necessarily quality of life,
p150
aVbecause healthy people don't usually need surgery,
p151
aVand unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.
p152
aVThe question had to be asked,
p153
aV"Well, can we do these same surgeries
p154
aVbut through little incisions?"
p155
aVLaparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:
p156
aVsurgery with long instruments through small incisions.
p157
aVAnd it really changed the landscape of surgery.
p158
aVSome of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,
p159
aVbut it had only been used as a diagnostic technique
p160
aVuntil the 1980s,
p161
aVwhen there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,
p162
aVthat allowed this to be done for real operations.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo what you see \u2014 this is now the first surgical image \u2014
p165
aVas we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.
p166
aVIt looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.
p167
aVWe bring instruments in,
p168
aVfrom two separate cuts in the side,
p169
aVand then you can start manipulating tissue.
p170
aVWithin 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries
p171
aVbeing done laparoscopically,
p172
aVa majority of gallbladder surgeries
p173
aVwere being done laparoscopically \u2014
p174
aVtruly a pretty big revolution.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut there were casualties of this revolution.
p177
aVThese techniques were a lot harder to learn
p178
aVthan people had anticipated.
p179
aVThe learning curve was very long.
p180
aVAnd during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.
p181
aVSurgeons had to give up their 3D vision.
p182
aVThey had to give up their wrists.
p183
aVThey had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.
p184
aVThis surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
p185
aVNow this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.
p186
aVBut this is hard.
p187
aVAnd one of the reasons why it is so hard
p188
aVis because the external ergonomics are terrible.
p189
aVYou've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.
p190
aVAnd the instruments are essentially working backwards.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,
p193
aVand put it on the other side of that small incision,
p194
aVis you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
p195
aVAnd so \u2014 I get to talk about robots \u2014
p196
aVthe da Vinci robot
p197
aVput just that wrist on the other side of that incision.
p198
aVAnd so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
p199
aVAnd now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,
p200
aVyou can precisely place the needle in your instruments,
p201
aVand you can pass it all the way through
p202
aVand follow it in a trajectory.
p203
aVAnd the reason why this becomes so much easier
p204
aVis \u2014 you can see on the bottom \u2014
p205
aVthe hands are making the motions,
p206
aVand the instruments are following those motions exactly.
p207
aVNow, what you put between those instruments and those hands,
p208
aVis a large, fairly complicated robot.
p209
aVThe surgeon is sitting at a console,
p210
aVand controlling the robot with these controllers.
p211
aVAnd the robot is moving these instruments around,
p212
aVand powering them, down inside the body.
p213
aVYou have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd since this was introduced in 1999,
p216
aVa lot of these robots have been out
p217
aVand being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,
p218
aVwhich is a prostate deep in the pelvis,
p219
aVand it requires fine dissection
p220
aVand delicate manipulation
p221
aVto be able to get a good surgical outcome.
p222
aVYou can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart
p223
aVwithout cracking the chest.
p224
aVThis is all done in between the ribs.
p225
aVAnd you can go inside the heart itself
p226
aVand repair the valves from the inside.
p227
aVYou've got these technologies \u2014 thank you \u2014
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aVAnd so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!
p230
aVSo, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"
p231
aVAnd there are some reasons, some good reasons.
p232
aVAnd cost is one of them.
p233
aa(lp234
VI talked about the large, complicated robot.
p235
aVWith all its bells and whistles, one of those robots
p236
aVwill cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.
p237
aVMore useful than a solid gold surgeon,
p238
aVbut, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.
p239
aVBut once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.
p240
aVBut there are other barriers.
p241
aVSo something like a prostatectomy \u2014
p242
aVthe prostate is small, and it's in one spot,
p243
aVand you can set your robot up very precisely
p244
aVto work in that one spot.
p245
aVAnd so it's perfect for something like that.
p246
aVAnd in fact if you, or anyone you know,
p247
aVhad their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,
p248
aVchances are it was done with one of these systems.
p249
aVBut if you need to reach more places than just one,
p250
aVyou need to move the robot.
p251
aVAnd you need to put some new incisions in there.
p252
aVAnd you need to re-set it up.
p253
aVAnd then you need to add some more ports, and more.
p254
aVAnd the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd for that reason there are many surgeries
p257
aVthat just aren't being done with the da Vinci.
p258
aVSo we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"
p259
aVWhat if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up
p260
aVeach time we wanted to move somewhere different?
p261
aVWhat if we could bring all the instruments
p262
aVin together in one place?
p263
aVHow would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?
p264
aVAnd how would that change the experience for the patient?
p265
aVNow, to do that,
p266
aVwe need to be able to bring a camera
p267
aVand instruments in together through one small tube,
p268
aVlike that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.
p269
aVOr, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo what's going to come out of that tube
p272
aVis the debut of this new technology,
p273
aVthis new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.
p274
aVReady? So here it comes.
p275
aVThis is the camera, and three instruments.
p276
aVAnd as you see it come out,
p277
aVin order to actually be able to do anything useful,
p278
aVit can't all stay clustered up like this.
p279
aVIt has to be able to come off of the centerline
p280
aVand then be able to work back toward that centerline.
p281
aVHe's a cheeky little devil.
p282
aVBut what this lets you do
p283
aVis gives you that all-important traction,
p284
aVand counter-traction,
p285
aVso that you can dissect, so that you can sew,
p286
aVso that you can do all the things that you need to do,
p287
aVall the surgical tasks.
p288
aVBut it's all coming in through one incision.
p289
aVIt's not so simple.
p290
aVBut it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us
p291
aVas we're going around.
p292
aVFor the patient, however,
p293
aVit's transparent. This is all they're going to see.
p294
aa(lp295
VIt's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.
p296
aVWe get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.
p297
aVAs we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,
p298
aVwe get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.
p299
aVAnd I think to really get the rest of the way
p300
aVin that revolution,
p301
aVwe need to not just take our hands in in new ways,
p302
aVwe also need to take our eyes in in new ways.
p303
aVWe need to see beyond the surface.
p304
aVWe need to be able to guide what we're cutting
p305
aVin a much better way.
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is a cancer surgery.
p308
aVOne of the problems with this,
p309
aVeven for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,
p310
aVis you can't see the cancer,
p311
aVespecially when it's hidden below the surface.
p312
aVAnd so what we're starting to do
p313
aVis we're starting to inject specially designed markers
p314
aVinto the bloodstream that will target the cancer.
p315
aVIt will go, bind to the cancer.
p316
aVAnd we can make those markers glow.
p317
aVAnd we can take special cameras,
p318
aVand we can look at it.
p319
aVNow we know where we need to cut,
p320
aVeven when it's below the surface.
p321
aVWe can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.
p322
aVAnd we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,
p323
aVso we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.
p324
aVWe can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,
p325
aVso that when we do a new vessel
p326
aVand we bypass a blockage on the heart,
p327
aVwe can see if we actually made the connection,
p328
aVbefore we close that patient back up again \u2014
p329
aVsomething that we haven't been able to do
p330
aVwithout radiation before.
p331
aVWe can light up tumors
p332
aVlike this kidney tumor,
p333
aVso that you can exactly see where the boundary is
p334
aVbetween the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,
p335
aVor the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd we don't even need to confine ourselves
p338
aVto this macro vision.
p339
aVWe have flexible microscopic probes
p340
aVthat we can bring down into the body.
p341
aVAnd we can look at cells directly.
p342
aVI'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,
p343
aVand the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.
p344
aVSo this is all very prototypey at this point.
p345
aVBut you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.
p346
aVBecause they let you keep continence,
p347
aVbladder control, and sexual function after surgery,
p348
aVall of which is generally fairly important to the patient.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, with the combination of these technologies
p351
aVwe can reach it all, and we can see it all.
p352
aVWe can heal the disease.
p353
aVAnd we can leave the patient whole and intact
p354
aVand functional afterwards.
p355
aVNow, I've talked about the patient
p356
aVas if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract
p357
aVoutside this room.
p358
aVAnd that is not the case.
p359
aVMany of you, all of you maybe,
p360
aVwill at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,
p361
aVor heart disease, or some organ dysfunction
p362
aVthat's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.
p363
aVAnd when you get to that point \u2014
p364
aVI mean, these maladies don't care
p365
aVhow many books you've written,
p366
aVhow many companies you've started,
p367
aVthat Nobel Prize you have yet to win,
p368
aVhow much time you planned to spend with your children.
p369
aVThese maladies come for us all.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...
p372
aVis that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?
p373
aVI'm not sure I really even want it to.
p374
aVBecause facing your own mortality
p375
aVcauses a re-evaluation of priorities,
p376
aVand a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.
p377
aVAnd I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.
p378
aVWhat I want instead,
p379
aVis for you to be whole, intact,
p380
aVand functional enough to go out and save the world,
p381
aVafter you've decided you need to do it.
p382
aVAnd that is my vision for your future.
p383
aVThank you.
