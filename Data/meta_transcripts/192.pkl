VYou've all seen lots of articles on climate change,
p4
aVand here's yet another New York Times article,
p5
aVjust like every other darn one you've seen.
p6
aVIt says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.
p7
aVIt even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.
p8
aVWhat's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.
p9
aVAnd the reason I'm saying this
p10
aVis that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
p11
aVThat people have just sort of figured out about it, and now
p12
aVwith Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,
p13
aVwe may be on the road to a solution.
p14
aVThe fact is \u2014 uh-uh.
p15
aVWe've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.
p16
aVWe have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.
p17
aVAnd we've accomplished close to zip.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.
p20
aVYou've seen this in various forms,
p21
aVbut maybe you haven't seen this one.
p22
aVWhat this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
p23
aVAnd that it's accelerating even faster
p24
aVthan what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.
p25
aVSo that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said
p26
aVthe environmentalists only put in the projections
p27
aVto make the projections look as bad as possible,
p28
aVthat emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.
p29
aVBut in fact, they're growing faster.
p30
aa(lp31
VHere's some data from actually just 10 days ago,
p32
aVwhich shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.
p33
aVAnd the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.
p34
aVSo despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and
p35
aVburning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties \u2014
p36
aVin fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,
p37
aVbecause it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)
p38
aVNo, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on
p39
aVthis very high inertial thing \u2014 our big economy \u2014 we've really hardly started.
p40
aVReally, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.
p41
aa(lp42
VI don't want to depress you too much.
p43
aVThe problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.
p44
aVCheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
p45
aVCheap meaning a few percent of GDP.
p46
aVNo, this is really important to have this sense of scale.
p47
aVSo the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,
p48
aVdealing with electricity production,
p49
aVwhich causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.
p50
aVAnd we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,
p51
aVand wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,
p52
aVwhich are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
p53
aVAll we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.
p54
aVInstead, we spend our time talking.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.
p57
aVWhat I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.
p58
aVAnd it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do
p59
aVif you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.
p60
aVAnd you need to deal \u2014 somehow break the link between human actions
p61
aVthat change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important
p62
aVbecause, of course, while we can adapt to climate change \u2014
p63
aVand it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.
p64
aVOh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.
p65
aVBut one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers \u2014 not all losers.
p66
aVBut, of course, the natural world, polar bears.
p67
aVI spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.
p68
aVThey will completely lose.
p69
aVAnd there's no adaption.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo this problem is absolutely soluble.
p72
aVThis geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.
p73
aVYou could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles \u2014 sulfates \u2014
p74
aVinto the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
p75
aVwhere they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.
p76
aVAnd I know for certain that that will work.
p77
aVNot that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.
p78
aVAnd the reason is, it's been done.
p79
aVAnd it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.
p80
aa(lp81
VHere's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur
p82
aVin the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.
p83
aVThe result of that was pretty dramatic.
p84
aVAfter that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see
p85
aVa quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.
p86
aVSo this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
p87
aVand it heats up after these volcanoes.
p88
aVBut you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere
p89
aVand the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
p90
aVThere's no big mystery about it.
p91
aVThere's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,
p92
aVlike it partially destroys the ozone layer \u2014 and I'll get to that in a minute.
p93
aVBut it clearly cools down.
p94
aVAnd one other thing: it's fast.
p95
aVIt's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,
p96
aVlike slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time
p97
aVto build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.
p98
aVAnd not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,
p99
aVbecause concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,
p100
aVis the sum of emissions over time.
p101
aVSo you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
p102
aVBut if you do this, it's quick.
p103
aVAnd there are times you might like to do something quick.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnother thing you might wonder about is, does it work?
p106
aVCan you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,
p107
aVand produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?
p108
aVAnd the answer seems to be yes.
p109
aVSo here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.
p110
aVThat's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,
p111
aVwith twice the amount of CO2 in the air.
p112
aVThe lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,
p113
aVand you're back to the original climate.
p114
aVAnd this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because
p115
aVKen \u2014 at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s \u2014
p116
aVKen and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,
p117
aV"Geo-engineering won't work."
p118
aVAnd to the person who was promoting it said,
p119
aV"The atmosphere's much more complicated."
p120
aVGave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.
p121
aVKen went and ran his models, and found that it did.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis topic is also old.
p124
aVThat report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old \u2014
p125
aV1965.
p126
aVThat report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science \u2014
p127
aVthe only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.
p128
aVIt didn't even talk about cutting emissions,
p129
aVwhich is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.
p130
aVI'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.
p131
aVWe should, but it made exactly this point.
p132
aVSo, in a sense, there's not much new.
p133
aVThe one new thing is this essay.
p134
aVSo I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,
p135
aVand the various reports of the U.S. National Academy \u2014
p136
aV1977, 1982, 1990 \u2014 people always talked about this idea.
p137
aVNot as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut when climate became, politically, a hot topic \u2014 if I may make the pun \u2014
p140
aVin the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
p141
aVIt just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
p142
aVBut in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay
p143
aVsaying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate
p144
aVof progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,
p145
aVwe should think about things like this.
p146
aVHe said roughly what's been said before.
p147
aVThe big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.
p148
aVAnd so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,
p149
aVeven though there will be some ozone impacts.
p150
aVAnd in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.
p151
aa(lp152
VThere was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,
p153
aVgoing right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.
p154
aVAnd that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,
p155
aVbut not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.
p156
aVAnd I thought about this child's toy \u2014 hence, the title of my talk \u2014
p157
aVand I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round
p158
aVin the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere
p159
aVand make them stay there.
p160
aVOne of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.
p161
aVThe other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,
p162
aVand I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.
p163
aVAnd it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.
p164
aVIt was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.
p165
aVBut then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published
p166
aVthat addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.
p167
aVSo it seems there are already fine particles
p168
aVthat are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,
p169
aVthat already have this effect.
p170
aa(lp171
VI'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.
p172
aVThere are a lot of fun complexities
p173
aVthat I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.
p174
aVBut let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.
p175
aVSo the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.
p176
aVGas molecules that bounce off the warm side
p177
aVbounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.
p178
aVAnd so you see a net force away from the sun.
p179
aVThat's called the photophoretic force.
p180
aVThere are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators
p181
aVhave thought about how to exploit.
p182
aVAnd of course, we may be wrong \u2014
p183
aVthis hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it \u2014
p184
aVbut so far, it seems good.
p185
aVBut it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes \u2014
p186
aVmuch longer than before \u2014 because they're levitated.
p187
aVWe can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,
p188
aVin principle solving the ozone problem.
p189
aVI'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
p190
aVFinally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,
p191
aVso we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.
p192
aVWhich would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,
p193
aVwhere we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,
p194
aVwhich is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,
p197
aVa cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.
p198
aVWhether this idea is right or some other idea is right,
p199
aVI think it's almost certain we will
p200
aVeventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.
p201
aVThat if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,
p202
aVit's amazing how we can affect the planet.
p203
aVThe one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.
p204
aVThis improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,
p205
aVgive us more and more leverage to affect the planet,
p206
aVto control the planet,
p207
aVto give us weather and climate control \u2014 not because we plan it,
p208
aVnot because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,
p209
aVwith better knowledge of the way the system works
p210
aVand better engineering tools to effect it.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, suppose that space aliens arrived.
p213
aVMaybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,
p214
aVor maybe they'll pick a smarter spot \u2014
p215
aVbut suppose they arrive and they give you a box.
p216
aVAnd the box has two knobs.
p217
aVOne knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.
p218
aVMaybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.
p219
aVYou might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.
p220
aVBecause we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.
p221
aVWe have no global governance.
p222
aVAnd different people will have different places they want it set.
p223
aVNow, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut we're building that box.
p226
aVThe scientists and engineers of the world
p227
aVare building it piece by piece, in their labs.
p228
aVEven when they're doing it for other reasons.
p229
aVEven when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.
p230
aVThey have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.
p231
aVThey develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.
p232
aVAnd so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it \u2014 I do not \u2014
p233
aVbut that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
p234
aVBecause sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,
p235
aVand it's better if we think hard about it,
p236
aVeven if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.
p237
aa(lp238
VI'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning
p239
aVof my thinking about how to think about it.
p240
aVBut what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.
p241
aVWe need a broader debate.
p242
aVA debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,
p243
aVwho get engaged with this question about climate engineering
p244
aVand think seriously about what its implications are.
p245
aVSo here's one way to think about it,
p246
aVwhich is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.
p247
aVI guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.
p248
aVIt's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,
p249
aVyou could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.
p250
aVIt's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
p251
aVIt's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)
p252
aVI'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.
p253
aVAnd that calculation isn't much in dispute.
p254
aVYou might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VSo because of this, we could deal with the problem
p257
aVsimply by stopping reducing emissions,
p258
aVand just as the concentrations go up, we can increase
p259
aVthe amount of geo-engineering.
p260
aVI don't think anybody takes that seriously.
p261
aVBecause under this scenario, we walk further and further away
p262
aVfrom the current climate.
p263
aVWe have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification
p264
aVthat come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.
p265
aVNobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut here's a case which is harder to reject.
p268
aVLet's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,
p269
aVwhich is get serious about cutting emissions.
p270
aVBut we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.
p271
aVThere's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.
p272
aVSo let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,
p273
aVbut we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions
p274
aVand eventually reduce concentrations.
p275
aVAnd maybe someday \u2014 like 2075, October 23 \u2014
p276
aVwe finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked
p277
aVand are rolling down the other side.
p278
aVAnd we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to \u2014 you know,
p279
aVwe've seen the worst of it.
p280
aVBut maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet
p281
aVis really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on
p282
aVthe oceans in the next 100 years,
p283
aVand remove some of the biggest cities from the map.
p284
aVThat's an absolutely possible scenario.
p285
aVWe might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain
p286
aVand morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.
p287
aVAnd that's a very different way to look at the problem.
p288
aVIt's using this as risk control, not instead of action.
p289
aVIt's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while
p290
aVto take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut there is a problem with that view.
p293
aVAnd the problem is the following:
p294
aVknowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes
p295
aVthe climate impacts look less fearsome,
p296
aVand that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.
p297
aVThis is what economists call a moral hazard.
p298
aVAnd that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,
p299
aVand, in general, I think it's the underlying reason
p300
aVthat it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.
p301
aVBut you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.
p302
aa(lp303
VI'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.
p304
aVShould we do serious research on this topic?
p305
aVShould we have a national research program that looks at this?
p306
aVNot just at how you would do it better,
p307
aVbut also what all the risks and downsides of it are.
p308
aVRight now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,
p309
aVsome in a negative side \u2014 but that's a dangerous state to be in
p310
aVbecause there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.
p311
aVA very small amount of money would get us some.
p312
aVMany of us \u2014 maybe now me \u2014 think we should do that.
p313
aVBut I have a lot of reservations.
p314
aVMy reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,
p315
aVand I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.
p316
aVI think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,
p317
aVpeople begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnother thing is, maybe we need a treaty.
p320
aVA treaty that decides who gets to do this.
p321
aVRight now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.
p322
aVBut it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes
p323
aVthat the climate impacts are just unacceptable,
p324
aVthey may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,
p325
aVand they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world
p326
aVthan a non-geo-engineered world.
p327
aVAnd we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo here's one last thought, which was said much, much better
p330
aV25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.
p331
aVAnd I think it really summarizes where we are here.
p332
aVThat the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,
p333
aVis driving lots of things \u2014 innovations in the energy technologies
p334
aVthat will reduce emissions \u2014
p335
aVbut also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate
p336
aVand weather control, whether we like it or not.
p337
aVAnd it's time to begin thinking about it,
p338
aVeven if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments
p339
aVfor why we shouldn't do it.
