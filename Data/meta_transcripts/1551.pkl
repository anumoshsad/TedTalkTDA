VI'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,
p4
aVand you may think that sculptors,
p5
aVwell, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,
p6
aVthey deal with bodies,
p7
aVbut I think, really, what I care about most
p8
aVis making space, and that's what I've called this talk:
p9
aVMaking Space.
p10
aVSpace that exists within us,
p11
aVand without us.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, when I was a child,
p14
aVI don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,
p15
aVbut I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)
p16
aVIt's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,
p17
aVyou're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.
p18
aVBut I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room
p19
aVthat was actually made out of an old balcony,
p20
aVso it was incredibly hot, small and light,
p21
aVand I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.
p22
aVBut anyway, for some reason, I promised myself
p23
aVthat I wasn't going to move,
p24
aVthat I was going to do this thing that Mummy
p25
aVwanted me to do.
p26
aVAnd there I was, lying there in this tiny space,
p27
aVhot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,
p28
aVbut it was really weird, like, after this went on
p29
aVfor days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger
p30
aVand darker and cooler
p31
aVuntil I really looked forward to that half an hour
p32
aVof enforced immobility and rest,
p33
aVand I really looked forward to going to that place
p34
aVof darkness.
p35
aa(lp36
VDo you mind if we do something completely different?
p37
aVCan we all just close our eyes for a minute?
p38
aVNow, this isn't going to be freaky.
p39
aVIt isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)
p40
aVIt's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.
p41
aVSo I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo close your eyes for a minute.
p44
aVHere we are, in a space,
p45
aVthe subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.
p46
aVI think of this as the place of imagination,
p47
aVof potential,
p48
aVbut what are its qualities?
p49
aVIt is objectless. There are no things in it.
p50
aVIt is dimensionless. It is limitless.
p51
aVIt is endless.
p52
aa(lp53
VOkay, open your eyes.
p54
aa(lp55
VThat's the space that I think sculpture \u2014
p56
aVwhich is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about
p57
aVmaking material propositions \u2014
p58
aVbut I think that's the space
p59
aVthat sculpture can connect us with.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, imagine we're in the middle of America.
p62
aVYou're asleep. You wake up,
p63
aVand without lifting your head from the earth
p64
aVon your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.
p65
aVThis is a dry lake bed.
p66
aVI was young. I'd just finished art school.
p67
aVI wanted to do something that was working
p68
aVdirectly with the world, directly with place.
p69
aVThis was a wonderful place, because it was a place
p70
aVwhere you could imagine that you were the
p71
aVfirst person to be there.
p72
aVIt was a place where nothing very much had happened.
p73
aVAnyway, bear with me.
p74
aVI picked up a hand-sized stone,
p75
aVthrew it as far as I was able,
p76
aVit was about 22 meters.
p77
aVI then cleared all the stones within that radius
p78
aVand made a pile.
p79
aVAnd that was the pile, by the way.
p80
aVAnd then, I stood on the pile,
p81
aVand threw all of those rocks out again,
p82
aVand here is rearranged desert.
p83
aa(lp84
VYou could say, well, it doesn't look very different
p85
aVfrom when he started.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVWhat's all the fuss about?
p88
aVIn fact, Chris was worried and said,
p89
aV"Look, don't show them that slide,
p90
aVbecause they're just going to think you're another one of
p91
aVthose crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBut the fact is, this is evidence
p95
aVof a living body on other bodies,
p96
aVrocks that have been the subject of geological formation,
p97
aVerosion, the action of time on objects.
p98
aVThis is a place, in a way, that I just
p99
aVwould like you to, in a way, look at differently
p100
aVbecause of this event that has happened in it,
p101
aVa human event,
p102
aVand in general, it just asks us to look again
p103
aVat this world, so different from, in a way,
p104
aVthe world that we have been sharing with each other,
p105
aVthe technological world,
p106
aVto look again at the elemental world.
p107
aVThe elemental world that we all live in is that space
p108
aVthat we all visited together, the darkness of the body.
p109
aVI wanted to start again with that environment,
p110
aVthe environment of the intimate, subjective space
p111
aVthat each of us lives in, but from the other side
p112
aVof appearance.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo here is a daily activity of the studio.
p115
aVYou can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,
p116
aVagain with my eyes closed, and other people
p117
aVare molding me, evidential.
p118
aVThis is an indexical register of a lived moment
p119
aVof a body in time.
p120
aa(lp121
VCan we map that space, using the language of neutrinos
p122
aVor cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body
p123
aVas its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,
p124
aVthe most traditional Greek idea of pointing?
p125
aVIn the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble
p126
aVand drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,
p127
aVthe appearance,
p128
aVwhat Aristotle defined as the distinction
p129
aVbetween substance and appearance,
p130
aVthe thing that makes things visible,
p131
aVbut here we're working from the other side.
p132
aa(lp133
VOr can we do it as an exclusive membrane?
p134
aVThis is a lead case made around the space
p135
aVthat my body occupied, but it's now void.
p136
aVThis is a work called "Learning To See."
p137
aVIt's a bit of, well, we could call it night,
p138
aVwe could call it the 96 percent of gravity
p139
aVthat we don't know about, dark matter,
p140
aVplaced in space, anyway, another version of a human space
p141
aVin space at large, but I don't know if you can see,
p142
aVthe eyes are indicated, they're closed.
p143
aVIt's called "Learning To See" because it's about an object
p144
aVthat hopefully works reflexively and talks about that
p145
aVvision or connection with the darkness of the body
p146
aVthat I see as a space of potential.
p147
aa(lp148
VCan we do it another way, using the language
p149
aVof particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body
p150
aVas an energy center?
p151
aVNo longer about statues, no longer having to take that
p152
aVduty of standing, the standing of a human body,
p153
aVor the standing of a statue, release it,
p154
aVallow it to be an energy field, a space in space
p155
aVthat talks about human life, between becoming an entropy
p156
aVas a sort of concentration of attention,
p157
aVa human place of possibility in space at large.
p158
aa(lp159
VIs there another way?
p160
aVDark matter now placed against a horizon.
p161
aVIf minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,
p162
aVand then in rooms, and then in buildings,
p163
aVand then in cities, do they also have a final skin,
p164
aVand is that skin perceptual?
p165
aVThe horizon.
p166
aVAnd is art about
p167
aVtrying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?
p168
aVCan we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst
p169
aVfor a kind of empathy with the experience
p170
aVof space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here
p171
aVin front of you trying to feel and make a connection
p172
aVin this space-time that we are sharing,
p173
aVcan we use, at it were, the memory of a body,
p174
aVof a human space in space to catalyze
p175
aVan experience, again, firsthand experience,
p176
aVof elemental time.
p177
aVHuman time, industrial time, tested against
p178
aVthe time of the tides, in which these memories
p179
aVof a particular body, that could be any body,
p180
aVmultiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,
p181
aVmany times, placed over three square miles,
p182
aVa mile out to sea,
p183
aVdisappearing, in different conditions of day and night.
p184
aVYou can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,
p185
aVjust outside Liverpool.
p186
aVAnd there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like
p187
aVon a typical afternoon.
p188
aVThe pieces appear and disappear,
p189
aVbut maybe more importantly \u2014
p190
aVthis is just looking north from the center of the installation \u2014
p191
aVthey create a field, a field that involves
p192
aVliving and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,
p193
aVa relation with each other and a relation with that limit,
p194
aVthe edge, the horizon.
p195
aa(lp196
VJust moving on, is it possible,
p197
aVtaking that idea of mind, body, body-building,
p198
aVto supplant the first body,
p199
aVthe biological body, with the second,
p200
aVthe body of architecture and the built environment.
p201
aa(lp202
VThis is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert."
p203
aVIt's in an undefined location
p204
aVand I've never published where it is.
p205
aVIt's an object for the mind.
p206
aVI think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.
p207
aVAgain, the darkness of the body,
p208
aVnow held within this bunker shape
p209
aVof the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,
p210
aVa crouching body.
p211
aVThere's a hole at the anus, penis level.
p212
aVThere are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.
p213
aVThere's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,
p214
aVconcrete with a void interior.
p215
aVAgain, a site found with a completely flat
p216
aV360-degree horizon.
p217
aVThis is just simply asking, again,
p218
aVas if we had arrived for the first time,
p219
aVwhat is the relationship of the human project
p220
aVto time and space?
p221
aa(lp222
VTaking that idiom of, as it were,
p223
aVthe darkness of the body transferred to architecture,
p224
aVcan you use architectural space not for living
p225
aVbut as a metaphor,
p226
aVand use its systolic, diastolic
p227
aVsmaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of
p228
aVfirsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,
p229
aVlight and darkness?
p230
aVThis is a work of some proportion and some weight
p231
aVthat makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells
p232
aVthat are all interconnected
p233
aVand that allow certain visual access
p234
aVat certain places.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe last work that I just wanted to share with you
p237
aVis "Blind Light," which is perhaps
p238
aVthe most open work,
p239
aVand in a conference of radical openness,
p240
aVI think maybe this is as radical as I get,
p241
aVusing light and water vapor as my materials.
p242
aVHere is a box
p243
aVfilled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,
p244
aVwith a cloud and with very bright light.
p245
aVAs you walk towards the ever-open threshold,
p246
aVyou disappear, both to yourselves and to others.
p247
aVIf you hold your hand out in front of you,
p248
aVyou can't see it.
p249
aVIf you look down, you can't see your feet.
p250
aVYou are now consciousness without an object,
p251
aVfreed from the dimensionful
p252
aVand measured way in which life links us
p253
aVto the obligatory.
p254
aVBut this is a space that is actually filled with people,
p255
aVdisembodied voices,
p256
aVand out of that ambient environment,
p257
aVwhen people come close to your own body zone,
p258
aVvery close, they appear to you as representations.
p259
aVWhen they appear close to the edge,
p260
aVthey are representations, representations in which
p261
aVthe viewers have become the viewed.
p262
aa(lp263
VFor me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.
p264
aVIt's about reasserting our firsthand experience
p265
aVin present time.
p266
aVAs John Cage said,
p267
aV"We are not moving towards some kind of goal.
p268
aVWe are at the goal, and it is changing with us.
p269
aVIf art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."
p270
aVThank you very much.
