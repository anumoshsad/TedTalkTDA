VOn Mondays and Thursdays, I learn how to die.
p4
aVI call them my terminal days.
p5
aVMy wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,
p6
aVbut a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer
p7
aVand my parents and grandparents had it.
p8
aVAnd I kept thinking, one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor
p9
aVwho looks at my exams and says,
p10
aV"Ricardo, things don't look very good.
p11
aVYou have six months or a year to live."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd you start thinking about what you would do with this time.
p14
aVAnd you say, "I'm going to spend  more time with the kids.
p15
aVI'm going to visit these places,
p16
aVI'm going to go up and down mountains and places
p17
aVand I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time."
p18
aVBut of course, we all know
p19
aVthese are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have.
p20
aVIt's very difficult to do.
p21
aVYou spend a good part of the time crying, probably.
p22
aVSo I said, I'm going to do something else.
p23
aa(lp24
VEvery Monday and Thursday, I'm going use my terminal days.
p25
aVAnd I will do, during those days,
p26
aVwhatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen you think about \u2014
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aVwhen you think about the opposite of work,
p32
aVwe, many times, think it's leisure.
p33
aVAnd you say, ah, I need  some leisure time, and so forth.
p34
aVBut the fact is that, leisure is a very busy thing.
p35
aVYou go play golf and tennis, and you meet people,
p36
aVand you're going for lunch, and you're late for the movies.
p37
aVIt's a very crowded thing that we do.
p38
aVThe opposite of work is idleness.
p39
aVBut very few of us know what to do with idleness.
p40
aVWhen you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general,
p41
aVyou realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money,
p42
aVwe have very little time.
p43
aVAnd then when we finally have time, we have neither the money nor the health.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years.
p46
aVThis is a complicated company with thousands of employees,
p47
aVhundreds of millions of dollars of business
p48
aVthat makes rocket fuel propellent systems, runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,
p49
aVdoes income tax preparation for dozens of thousands.
p50
aVSo this is not a simple business.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe looked at it and we said,
p53
aVlet's devolve to these people, let's give these people a company
p54
aVwhere we take away all the boarding school aspects
p55
aVof, this is when you arrive, this is how you dress,
p56
aVthis is how you go to meetings, this is what you say,
p57
aVthis is what you don't say,
p58
aVand let's see what's left.
p59
aVSo we started this about 30 years ago,
p60
aVand we started dealing with this very issue.
p61
aVAnd so we said, look, the retirement,
p62
aVthe whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life.
p63
aVInstead of going mountain climbing when you're 82,
p64
aVwhy don't you do it next week?
p65
aVAnd we'll do it like this,
p66
aVwe'll sell you back your Wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary.
p67
aVSo now, if you were going to be  a violinist, which you probably weren't,
p68
aVyou go and do this on Wednesday.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd what we found \u2014
p71
aVwe thought, these are the older people
p72
aVwho are going to be really interested in this program.
p73
aVAnd the average age of the first people who adhered
p74
aVwere 29, of course.
p75
aVAnd so we started looking,
p76
aVand we said, we have to do things in a different way.
p77
aVSo we started saying things like,
p78
aVwhy do we want to know what time you came to work,
p79
aVwhat time you left, etc.?
p80
aVCan't we exchange this for a contract
p81
aVfor buying something from you, some kind of work?
p82
aVWhy are we building these headquarters?
p83
aVIs it not an ego issue that we want to look solid
p84
aVand big and important?
p85
aVBut we're dragging you two hours across town because of it?
p86
aa(lp87
VSo we started asking questions one by one.
p88
aVWe'd say it like this:
p89
aVOne: How do we find people?
p90
aVWe'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say,
p91
aVlook, when you come to us,
p92
aVwe're not going to have two or three interviews
p93
aVand then you're going to be married to us for life.
p94
aVThat's not how we do  the rest of our lives.
p95
aVSo, come have your interviews.
p96
aVAnyone who's interested in interviewing, you will show up.
p97
aVAnd then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that,
p98
aVinstead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person.
p99
aVAnd then, come back.
p100
aVSpend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want.
p101
aVMake sure we are the bride  you thought we were
p102
aVand not all the bullshit we put into our own ads.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSlowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like,
p106
aVwe don't want anyone to be a leader in the company
p107
aVif they haven't been  interviewed and approved
p108
aVby their future subordinates.
p109
aVEvery six months, everyone gets  evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.
p110
aVAnd this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position,
p111
aVwhich is many times situational, as you know.
p112
aVAnd so if they don't have 70, 80 percent  of a grade, they don't stay,
p113
aVwhich is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.
p114
aVAnd over time, we started asking other questions.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe said things like,
p117
aVwhy can't people set their own salaries?
p118
aVWhat do they need to know?
p119
aVThere's only three things  you need to know:
p120
aVhow much people make inside the company,
p121
aVhow much people make somewhere else in a similar business
p122
aVand how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it.
p123
aVSo let's give people these three pieces of information.
p124
aVSo we started having, in the cafeteria,
p125
aVa computer where you could go in  and you could ask
p126
aVwhat someone spent,  how much someone makes,
p127
aVwhat they make in benefits,  what the company makes,
p128
aVwhat the margins are, and so forth.
p129
aVAnd this is 25 years ago.
p130
aa(lp131
VAs this information started  coming to people,
p132
aVwe said things like, we don't want  to see your expense report,
p133
aVwe don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking,
p134
aVwe don't want to know where you work.
p135
aVWe had, at one point, 14 different offices around town,
p136
aVand we'd say, go to the one  that's closest to your house,
p137
aVto the customer that  you're going to visit today.
p138
aVDon't tell us where you are.
p139
aVAnd more, even when we had thousands of people, 5,000 people,
p140
aVwe had two people in the H.R. department,
p141
aVand thankfully one of them has retired.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd so, the question we were asking was, how can we be taking care of people?
p145
aVPeople are the only thing we have.
p146
aVWe can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people.
p147
aVSo as we started finding that this worked, and we'd say, we're looking for \u2014
p148
aVand this is, I think, the main thing I was looking for
p149
aVin the terminal days and in the company,
p150
aVwhich is, how do you set up for wisdom?
p151
aVWe've come from an age of revolution, industrial revolution,
p152
aVan age of information, an age of knowledge,
p153
aVbut we're not any closer to the age of wisdom.
p154
aVHow we design, how do we organize, for more wisdom?
p155
aVSo for example, many times,
p156
aVwhat's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive.
p157
aVSo we'd say things like,
p158
aVlet's agree that you're going to sell 57 widgets per week.
p159
aVIf you sell them by Wednesday,  please go to the beach.
p160
aVDon't create a problem for us,  for manufacturing, for application,
p161
aVthen we have to buy new companies, we have to buy our competitors,
p162
aVwe have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets.
p163
aVSo go to the beach and start again on Monday.
p164
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VSo the process is looking for wisdom.
p167
aVAnd in the process, of course,  we wanted people to know everything,
p168
aVand we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things.
p169
aVSo our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights,
p170
aVfor the first two people who showed up.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVAnd so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting,
p173
aVwhich had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties.
p174
aVAnd the fact is that they kept us honest.
p175
aa(lp176
VThis process, as we started looking at the people who came to us,
p177
aVwe'd say, now wait a second,
p178
aVpeople come to us and they say, where am I supposed to sit?
p179
aVHow am I supposed to work? Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?
p180
aVAnd we looked at that and we said, we have to start much earlier.
p181
aVWhere do we start?
p182
aVWe said, oh, kindergarten  seems like a good place.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo we set up a foundation, which now has,  for 11 years, three schools,
p185
aVwhere we started asking the same questions,
p186
aVhow do you redesign school for wisdom?
p187
aVIt is one thing to say, we need to recycle the teachers,
p188
aVwe need the directors to do more.
p189
aVBut the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete.
p190
aVThe teacher's role is entirely obsolete.
p191
aVGoing from a math class, to biology, to 14th-century France is very silly.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aVSo we started thinking,  what could it look like?
p194
aVAnd we put together people,  including people who like education,
p195
aVpeople like Paulo Freire,  and two ministers of education in Brazil
p196
aVand we said, if we were to design a school from scratch,
p197
aVwhat would it look like?
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd so we created this school, which is called Lumiar,
p200
aVand Lumiar, one of them is a public school,
p201
aVand Lumiar says the following:
p202
aVLet's divide this role of the teacher into two.
p203
aVOne guy, we'll call a tutor.
p204
aVA tutor, in the old sense of the Greek "paideia": Look after the kid.
p205
aVWhat's happening at home, what's their moment in life, etc..
p206
aVBut please don't teach,
p207
aVbecause the little you know compared  to Google, we don't want to know.
p208
aVKeep that to yourself.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVNow, we'll bring in people who have two things:
p211
aVpassion and expertise, and it could be their profession or not.
p212
aVAnd we use the senior citizens,
p213
aVwho are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.
p214
aVSo we bring them to school and we say,
p215
aVteach these kids whatever you really believe in.
p216
aVSo we have violinists teaching math.
p217
aVWe have all kinds of things where we say,
p218
aVdon't worry about  the course material anymore.
p219
aVWe have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17.
p220
aVThings like, how do we measure ourselves as humans?
p221
aVSo there's a place for math and physics and all that there.
p222
aVHow do we express ourselves?
p223
aVSo there's a place for music and literature, etc.,
p224
aVbut also for grammar.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd then we have things that everyone has forgotten,
p227
aVwhich are probably the most  important things in life.
p228
aVThe very important things in life, we know nothing about.
p229
aVWe know nothing about love,
p230
aVwe know nothing about death,
p231
aVwe know nothing about why we're here.
p232
aVSo we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know.
p233
aVSo that's a big part of what we do.
p234
aV(Applause)
p235
aVSo over the years, we started going into other things.
p236
aVWe'd say, why do we have to scold the kids
p237
aVand say, sit down and come here  and do that, and so forth.
p238
aVWe said, let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle,
p239
aVwhich meets once a week.
p240
aVAnd we'd say, you put the rules together
p241
aVand then you decide what you want to do with it.
p242
aVSo can you all hit yourself on the head?
p243
aVSure, for a week, try.
p244
aVThey came up with the very same rules that we had,
p245
aVexcept they're theirs.
p246
aVAnd then, they have the power,
p247
aVwhich means, they can and do suspend and expel kids
p248
aVso that we're not playing school, they really decide.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd then, in this same vein,
p251
aVwe keep a digital mosaic,
p252
aVbecause this is not constructivist or Montessori or something.
p253
aVIt's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum
p254
aVwith 600 tiles of a mosaic,
p255
aVwhich we want to expose these kids to by the time they're 17.
p256
aVAnd follow this all the time and we know how they're doing
p257
aVand we say, you're not interested  in this now, let's wait a year.
p258
aVAnd the kids are in groups that don't have an age category,
p259
aVso the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,
p260
aVthat eliminates all of the gangs and the groups
p261
aVand this stuff that we have  in the schools, in general.
p262
aVAnd they have a zero  to 100 percent grading,
p263
aVwhich they do themselves with an app every couple of hours.
p264
aVUntil we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue,
p265
aVso that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it.
p266
aVAnd so the courses are World Cup Soccer, or building a bicycle.
p267
aVAnd people will sign up for  a 45-day course on building a bicycle.
p268
aVNow, try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is 3.1416.
p269
aVYou can't.
p270
aVAnd try, any one of you,  using 3.1416 for something.
p271
aVYou don't know anymore.
p272
aVSo this is lost and that's what  we try to do there,
p273
aVwhich is looking  for wisdom in that school.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life.
p276
aVI accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it.
p277
aVWhen you think and you say, now is the time to give back \u2014
p278
aVwell, if you're giving back,  you took too much.
p279
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p280
aVI keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day
p281
aVand finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had.
p282
aVAnd he looks and he says, what am I going to do with this?
p283
aVAnd he says, I'll give it to someone who really needs this.
p284
aVI'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)
p285
aVAnd my guy, who's my financial advisor in New York,
p286
aVhe says, look, you're a silly guy
p287
aVbecause you would have 4.1 times  more money today
p288
aVif you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go.
p289
aVBut I like sharing as you go better.
p290
aV(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
VI taught MBAs at MIT for a time
p293
aVand I ended up, one day, at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.
p294
aVIt is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.
p295
aVAnd I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking.
p296
aVAnd the first time around,  I saw these tombstones
p297
aVand these wonderful people  who'd done great things
p298
aVand I thought, what do I want  to be remembered for?
p299
aVAnd I did another stroll around,
p300
aVand the second time, another question came to me,
p301
aVwhich did me better, which was,
p302
aVwhy do I want to be remembered at all?
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aVAnd that, I think,  took me different places.
p305
aVWhen I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon,
p306
aVwe had a big pit with fire,
p307
aVand I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire.
p308
aVThis is a book in 38 languages,
p309
aVhundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs, everything there was.
p310
aVAnd that did two things.
p311
aVOne, it freed our five kids from following in our steps, our shadow \u2014
p312
aVThey don't know what I do.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVWhich is good.
p315
aVAnd I'm not going to take them somewhere
p316
aVand say, one day  all of this will be yours.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVThe five kids know nothing, which is good.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd the second thing is,
p321
aVI freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever.
p322
aVI'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch
p323
aVin part of those terminal days.
p324
aVAnd some people would say,
p325
aVoh, so now you have this time, these terminal days,
p326
aVand so you go out and do everything.
p327
aVNo, we've been to the beaches,
p328
aVso we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique,
p329
aVso that's done.
p330
aVI've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.
p331
aVI've gone down 60 meters to see  hammerhead sharks.
p332
aVI've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu.
p333
aVI've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled.
p334
aVSo, we've been busy.
p335
aVIt's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd with this rationale, I look at these days and I think,
p339
aVI'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all.
p340
aVAnd so I'm writing a new book.
p341
aVWe started three new companies in the last two years.
p342
aVI'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world,
p343
aVand I've found, very interestingly enough, that nobody wants it for free.
p344
aVAnd so I've been trying for 10 years
p345
aVto get the public system to take over this school rationale,
p346
aVmuch as the public schools we have,
p347
aVwhich has instead of 43 out of 100, as their rating, as their grades,
p348
aVhas 91 out of 100.
p349
aVBut for free, nobody wants it.
p350
aVSo maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere.
p351
aVBut getting this out is one of the things we want to do.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you,
p354
aVI think is a little bit like this:
p355
aVWe've all learned how to go on Sunday night
p356
aVto email and work from home.
p357
aVBut very few of us have learned
p358
aVhow to go to the movies on Monday afternoon.
p359
aVAnd if we're looking for wisdom, we need to learn to do that as well.
p360
aVAnd so, what we've done all of these years is very simple,
p361
aVis use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row.
p362
aVBecause the first why you always have a good answer for.
p363
aVThe second why, it starts getting difficult.
p364
aVBy the third why, you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing.
p365
aVWhat I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this,
p366
aVyou will come to the question, what for?
p367
aVWhat am I doing this for?
p368
aVAnd hopefully, as a result of that, and over time,
p369
aVI hope that with this, and that's what I'm wishing you,
p370
aVyou'll have a much wiser future.
p371
aVThank you very much.
p372
aV(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
VChris Anderson: So Ricardo,  you're kind of crazy.
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aVTo many people, this seems crazy.
p377
aVAnd yet so deeply wise, also.
p378
aVThe pieces I'm trying to put together are this:
p379
aVYour ideas are so radical.
p380
aVHow, in business, for example, these ideas have been out for a while,
p381
aVprobably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them
p382
aVis still quite low.
p383
aVAre there any times you've seen  some big company
p384
aVtake on one of your ideas  and you've gone, "Yes!"?
p385
aa(lp386
VRicardo Semler: It happens. It happened about two weeks ago
p387
aVwith Richard Branson, with his people saying,
p388
aVoh, I don't want to control your holidays anymore,
p389
aVor Netflix does a little bit of this and that,
p390
aVbut I don't think it's very important.
p391
aVI'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,
p392
aVbut that's a very personal one.
p393
aVBut the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control.
p394
aVAnd almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith.
p395
aVIt will have to come from kids  and other people
p396
aVwho are starting companies  in a different way.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: So that's the key thing?
p399
aVFrom your point of view the evidence is there,
p400
aVin the business point of view this works,
p401
aVbut people just don't have the courage to \u2014 (Whoosh)
p402
aa(lp403
VRS: They don't even have the incentive.
p404
aVYou're running a company with a 90-day mandate.
p405
aVIt's a quarterly report.
p406
aVIf you're not good in 90 days, you're out.
p407
aVSo you say, "Here's a great program that, in less than one generation \u2014"
p408
aVAnd the guy says, "Get out of here."
p409
aVSo this is the problem.
p410
aV(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VCA: What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound.
p413
aVEveryone is bothered about their country's education system.
p414
aVNo one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world
p415
aVwhere there's Google and all these  technological options.
p416
aVSo you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system,
p417
aVthere's a dramatic increase  in performance.
p418
aVHow do we help you move these ideas forward?
p419
aa(lp420
VRS: I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come.
p421
aVAnd I've never been very evangelical about these things.
p422
aVWe put it out there.
p423
aVSuddenly, you find people \u2014
p424
aVthere's a group in Japan,  which scares me very much,
p425
aVwhich is called the Semlerists, and they have 120 companies.
p426
aVThey've invited me. I've always been scared to go.
p427
aVAnd there is a group in Holland that has 600 small, Dutch companies.
p428
aVIt's something that will flourish on its own.
p429
aVPart of it will be wrong,  and it doesn't matter.
p430
aVThis will find its own place.
p431
aVAnd I'm afraid of the other one, which says,
p432
aVthis is so good you've got to do this.
p433
aVLet's set up a system  and put lots of money into it
p434
aVand then people will do it no matter what.
p435
aa(lp436
VCA: So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life.
p437
aVIt seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this.
p438
aVDo you have any other questions for us, for TED, for this group here?
p439
aa(lp440
VRS: I always come back  to variations of the question
p441
aVthat my son asked me when he was three.
p442
aVWe were sitting in a jacuzzi, and he said, "Dad, why do we exist?"
p443
aVThere is no other question.
p444
aVNobody has any other question.
p445
aVWe have variations of this one question, from three onwards.
p446
aVSo when you spend time in a company, in a bureaucracy, in an organization
p447
aVand you're saying, boy \u2014
p448
aVhow many people do you know who on their death beds said,
p449
aVboy, I wish I had spent more time at the office?
p450
aVSo there's a whole thing  of having the courage now \u2014
p451
aVnot in a week, not in two months,
p452
aVnot when you find out  you have something \u2014
p453
aVto say, no, what am I doing this for?
p454
aVStop everything. Let me do something else.
p455
aVAnd it will be okay,
p456
aVit will be much better than what you're doing,
p457
aVif you're stuck in a process.
p458
aa(lp459
VCA: So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end
p460
aVthis penultimate day of TED.
p461
aVRicardo Semler, thank you so much.
