VAs a lover of human anatomy,
p4
aVI'm so excited that we're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus.
p5
aVThrough practices such as preventive medicine,
p6
aVpatient empowerment
p7
aVand self-monitoring \u2014
p8
aVdown to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day.
p9
aVAll of this works to promote
p10
aVa healthy connection between ourselves and our bodies.
p11
aa(lp12
VDespite all this focus on the healthy self,
p13
aVgeneral public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking.
p14
aVMany people don't know the location of their vital organs,
p15
aVor even how they function.
p16
aVAnd that's because human anatomy
p17
aVis a difficult and time-intensive subject to learn.
p18
aa(lp19
VHow many of you here made it through anatomy?
p20
aVWow, good \u2014
p21
aVmost of you are in medicine.
p22
aVI, like you, spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures.
p23
aVSomething no student of anatomy could do without the help of visuals.
p24
aVBecause at the end of the day,
p25
aVwhether you remember every little structure or not,
p26
aVthese medical illustrations are what makes studying anatomy so intriguing.
p27
aVIn looking at them,
p28
aVwe're actually viewing a manual of our very selves.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut what happens when we're done studying?
p31
aVThese beautiful illustrations are then shut back
p32
aVinto the pages of a medical textbook,
p33
aVor an app,
p34
aVreferenced only when needed.
p35
aVAnd for the public,
p36
aVmedical illustrations may only be encountered passively
p37
aVon the walls of a doctor's office.
p38
aa(lp39
VFrom the beginnings of modern medicine,
p40
aVmedical illustration,
p41
aVand therefore anatomy,
p42
aVhave existed primarily within the realm of medical education.
p43
aVYet there's something fascinating happening right now.
p44
aVArtists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world
p45
aVand are thrusting it into the public space.
p46
aVFor the past nine years, I have been cataloguing and sharing
p47
aVthis rise in anatomical art with the public \u2014
p48
aVall from my perspective as a medical illustrator.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut before I get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,
p51
aVit's important to understand how art influenced anatomy in the past.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, anatomy is by its very nature a visual science,
p54
aVand the first anatomists to understand this lived during the Renaissance.
p55
aVThey relied on artists
p56
aVto help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public.
p57
aVAnd this drive to not only teach but also to entertain
p58
aVresulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnatomy was caught in a struggle between science, art and culture
p61
aVthat lasted for over 500 years.
p62
aVArtists rendered dissected cadavers as alive,
p63
aVposed in these humorous anatomical stripteases.
p64
aVImagine seeing that in your textbooks today.
p65
aVThey also showed them as very much dead \u2014
p66
aVunwillingly stripped of their skin.
p67
aVDisembodied limbs were often posed in literal still lives.
p68
aVAnd some illustrations even included pop culture references.
p69
aVThis is Clara,
p70
aVa famous rhinoceros that was traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,
p71
aVat a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity.
p72
aVIncluding her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe introduction of color
p75
aVthen brought a whole new depth and clarity to anatomy
p76
aVthat made it stunning.
p77
aa(lp78
VBy the early 20th century,
p79
aVthe perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck
p80
aVwith the emergence of medical illustrators.
p81
aVThey created a universal representation of anatomy \u2014
p82
aVsomething that was neither alive nor dead,
p83
aVthat was free from those influences of artistic culture.
p84
aVAnd this focus on no-frills accuracy
p85
aVwas precisely for the benefit of medical education.
p86
aVAnd this is what we get to study from today.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut why is it that medical illustration \u2014
p89
aVboth past and present \u2014
p90
aVcaptures our imaginations?
p91
aVNow, we are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body.
p92
aVAnd medical illustration is still art.
p93
aVNothing can elicit an emotional response \u2014
p94
aVfrom joy to complete disgust \u2014
p95
aVmore than the human body.
p96
aVAnd today,
p97
aVartists armed with that emotion,
p98
aVare grasping anatomy from the medical world,
p99
aVand are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways.
p100
aa(lp101
VA perfect example of this is Spanish contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.
p102
aVHe takes 19th century anatomical illustrations of the male body
p103
aVand envelops them in a female sensuality.
p104
aVThe women in his paintings taunt us to view beyond their surface anatomy,
p105
aVthereby introducing a strong femininity
p106
aVthat was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation.
p107
aa(lp108
VArtistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body.
p109
aVThis is an X-ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle
p110
aVin a roller-skating accident.
p111
aVAs a tribute to her trauma,
p112
aVshe commissioned Montreal-based architect Federico Carbajal
p113
aVto construct a wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg.
p114
aVNow, notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture.
p115
aVThese are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle.
p116
aVIt's medical hardware that's been repurposed as art.
p117
aa(lp118
VPeople often ask me how I choose the art that I showcase online
p119
aVor feature in gallery shows.
p120
aVAnd for me it's a balance between the technique
p121
aVand a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself,
p122
aVwhich is why the work of Michael Reedy struck me.
p123
aVHis serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor.
p124
aVFor instance, take a look at her face.
p125
aVNotice those red marks.
p126
aVMichael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition
p127
aVas these maniacal cartoon monsters
p128
aVannoying and out of control in the background.
p129
aVOn the mirrored figure,
p130
aVhe renders the full anatomy
p131
aVand covers it in glitter,
p132
aVmaking it look like candy.
p133
aVBy doing this,
p134
aVMichael downplays the common perception of anatomy
p135
aVso closely tied to just disease and death.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, this next concept might not make much sense,
p138
aVbut human anatomy is no longer limited to humans.
p139
aVWhen you were a child,
p140
aVdid you ever wish that your toys could come to life?
p141
aVWell, Jason Freeny makes those dreams come true
p142
aVwith his magical toy dissections.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VOne might think that this would bring a morbid edge
p147
aVto one's innocent childhood characters,
p148
aVbut Jason says of his dissections,
p149
aV"One thing I've never seen in a child's reaction to my work is fear."
p150
aVIt's always wonder,
p151
aVamazement
p152
aVand wanting to explore.
p153
aVFear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction.
p154
aa(lp155
VThis anatomization also extends to politically and socially charged objects.
p156
aVIn Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"
p157
aVwe see a gun dissected to reveal human organs.
p158
aVBut if you look closely,
p159
aVyou'll notice that it lacks a brain.
p160
aVAnd if you keep looking, you might also notice
p161
aVthat Noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum
p162
aVat the business end of that gun barrel.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, this next artist I've been following for many years,
p165
aVwatching him excite the public about anatomy.
p166
aVDanny Quirk is a young artist
p167
aVwho paints his subjects in the process of self-dissection.
p168
aVHe bends the rules of medical illustration
p169
aVby inserting a very dramatic light and shadow.
p170
aVAnd this creates a 3-D illusion
p171
aVthat lends itself very well to painting directly on the human skin.
p172
aVDanny makes it look as if a person's skin has actually been removed.
p173
aVAnd this effect \u2014
p174
aValso cool and tattoo-like \u2014
p175
aVeasily transitions into a medical illustration.
p176
aVNow Danny is currently traveling the world,
p177
aVteaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings,
p178
aVwhich is why it was so shocking to find out
p179
aVthat he was rejected from medical illustration programs.
p180
aVBut he's doing just fine.
p181
aa(lp182
VThen there are artists
p183
aVwho are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world
p184
aVand are placing it directly on the streets.
p185
aVLondon-based SHOK-1 paints giant X-rays of pop culture icons.
p186
aVHis X-rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own,
p187
aVand conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person.
p188
aVYou come to admire his work
p189
aVbecause reproducing X-rays by hand, let alone with spray paint,
p190
aVis extremely difficult.
p191
aVBut then again this is a street artist,
p192
aVwho also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry.
p193
aa(lp194
VNychos, an Austrian street artist,
p195
aVtakes the term "exploded view" to a whole new level,
p196
aVsplattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world.
p197
aVInfluenced by comics and heavy metal,
p198
aVNychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy
p199
aVthat I just love.
p200
aa(lp201
VStreet artists believe that art belongs to the public.
p202
aVAnd this street anatomy is so captivating
p203
aVbecause it is the furthest removed from the medical world.
p204
aVIt forces you to look at it,
p205
aVand confront your own perceptions about anatomy,
p206
aVwhether you find it beautiful,
p207
aVgross,
p208
aVmorbid
p209
aVor awe-inspiring, like I do.
p210
aVThat it elicits these responses at all
p211
aVis due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it.
p212
aa(lp213
VAll of the artists that I showed you here today
p214
aVreferenced medical illustrations for their art.
p215
aVBut for them,
p216
aVanatomy isn't just something to memorize,
p217
aVbut a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level;
p218
aVto depict it in ways that we can relate,
p219
aVwhether it be through cartoons,
p220
aVbody painting
p221
aVor street art.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnatomical art has the power
p224
aVto reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook,
p225
aVto ignite an excitement in the public,
p226
aVand reinvigorate an enthusiasm in the medical world,
p227
aVultimately connecting our innermost selves with our bodies through art.
p228

VThank you.
