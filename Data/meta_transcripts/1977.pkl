VType is something we consume
p4
aVin enormous quantities.
p5
aVIn much of the world,
p6
aVit's completely inescapable.
p7
aVBut few consumers are concerned to know
p8
aVwhere a particular typeface came from
p9
aVor when or who designed it,
p10
aVif, indeed, there was any human agency involved
p11
aVin its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize
p12
aVout of the software ether.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut I do have to be concerned with those things.
p15
aVIt's my job.
p16
aVI'm one of the tiny handful of people
p17
aVwho gets badly bent out of shape
p18
aVby the bad spacing of the T and the E
p19
aVthat you see there.
p20
aVI've got to take that slide off.
p21
aVI can't stand it. Nor can Chris.
p22
aVThere. Good.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo my talk is about the connection
p25
aVbetween technology and design of type.
p26
aVThe technology has changed
p27
aVa number of times since I started work:
p28
aVphoto, digital, desktop, screen, web.
p29
aVI've had to survive those changes and try
p30
aVto understand their implications for what I do
p31
aVfor design.
p32
aVThis slide is about the effect of tools on form.
p33
aVThe two letters, the two K's,
p34
aVthe one on your left, my right, is modern,
p35
aVmade on a computer.
p36
aVAll straight lines are dead straight.
p37
aVThe curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness
p38
aVthat the Bézier formula imposes.
p39
aVOn the right, ancient Gothic,
p40
aVcut in the resistant material of steel by hand.
p41
aVNone of the straight lines are actually straight.
p42
aVThe curves are kind of subtle.
p43
aVIt has that spark of life from the human hand
p44
aVthat the machine or the program
p45
aVcan never capture.
p46
aVWhat a contrast.
p47
aa(lp48
VWell, I tell a lie.
p49
aVA lie at TED. I'm really sorry.
p50
aVBoth of these were made on a computer,
p51
aVsame software, same Bézier curves,
p52
aVsame font format.
p53
aVThe one on your left
p54
aVwas made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,
p55
aVand I did the other one.
p56
aVThe tool is the same, yet the letters are different.
p57
aVThe letters are different
p58
aVbecause the designers are different.
p59
aVThat's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.
p60
aVI wanted mine to look like that. End of story.
p61
aVType is very adaptable.
p62
aVUnlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,
p63
aVtype hides its methods.
p64
aVI think of myself as an industrial designer.
p65
aVThe thing I design is manufactured,
p66
aVand it has a function:
p67
aVto be read, to convey meaning.
p68
aVBut there is a bit more to it than that.
p69
aVThere's the sort of aesthetic element.
p70
aVWhat makes these two letters different
p71
aVfrom different interpretations by different designers?
p72
aVWhat gives the work of some designers
p73
aVsort of characteristic personal style,
p74
aVas you might find in the work of a fashion designer,
p75
aVan automobile designer, whatever?
p76
aa(lp77
VThere have been some cases, I admit,
p78
aVwhere I as a designer
p79
aVdid feel the influence of technology.
p80
aVThis is from the mid-'60s,
p81
aVthe change from metal type to photo,
p82
aVhot to cold.
p83
aVThis brought some benefits
p84
aVbut also one particular drawback:
p85
aVa spacing system that only provided
p86
aV18 discrete units for letters
p87
aVto be accommodated on.
p88
aVI was asked at this time to design
p89
aVa series of condensed sans serif types
p90
aVwith as many different variants as possible
p91
aVwithin this 18-unit box.
p92
aVQuickly looking at the arithmetic,
p93
aVI realized I could only actually make three
p94
aVof related design. Here you see them.
p95
aVIn Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,
p96
aVand Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system
p97
aVreally boxed me in.
p98
aVIt kind of determined the proportions
p99
aVof the design.
p100
aVHere are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.
p101
aVSo do you look at these and say,
p102
aV"Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,
p103
aVand by God it shows in the results."
p104
aVI hope not.
p105
aVIf I were doing this same job today,
p106
aVinstead of having 18 spacing units,
p107
aVI would have 1,000.
p108
aVClearly I could make more variants,
p109
aVbut would these three members of the family be better?
p110
aVIt's hard to say without actually doing it,
p111
aVbut they would not be better in the proportion
p112
aVof 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.
p113
aVMy instinct tells you that any improvement
p114
aVwould be rather slight, because they were designed
p115
aVas functions of the system they were designed to fit,
p116
aVand as I said, type is very adaptable.
p117
aVIt does hide its methods.
p118
aVAll industrial designers work within constraints.
p119
aVThis is not fine art.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe question is, does a constraint
p122
aVforce a compromise?
p123
aVBy accepting a constraint,
p124
aVare you working to a lower standard?
p125
aVI don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged
p126
aVby something that Charles Eames said.
p127
aVHe said he was conscious of working
p128
aVwithin constraints,
p129
aVbut not of making compromises.
p130
aVThe distinction between a constraint
p131
aVand a compromise is obviously very subtle,
p132
aVbut it's very central to my attitude to work.
p133
aa(lp134
VRemember this reading experience?
p135
aVThe phone book. I'll hold the slide
p136
aVso you can enjoy the nostalgia.
p137
aVThis is from the mid-'70s early trials
p138
aVof Bell Centennial typeface I designed
p139
aVfor the U.S. phone books,
p140
aVand it was my first experience of digital type,
p141
aVand quite a baptism.
p142
aVDesigned for the phone books, as I said,
p143
aVto be printed at tiny size on newsprint
p144
aVon very high-speed rotary presses
p145
aVwith ink that was kerosene and lampblack.
p146
aVThis is not a hospitable environment
p147
aVfor a typographic designer.
p148
aVSo the challenge for me was to design type
p149
aVthat performed as well as possible
p150
aVin these very adverse production conditions.
p151
aVAs I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.
p152
aVI had to draw every character by hand
p153
aVon quadrille graph paper \u2014
p154
aVthere were four weights of Bell Centennial \u2014
p155
aVpixel by pixel, then encode them raster line by raster line
p156
aVfor the keyboard.
p157
aVIt took two years, but I learned a lot.
p158
aVThese letters look as though they've been chewed
p159
aVby the dog or something or other,
p160
aVbut the missing pixels at the intersections
p161
aVof strokes or in the crotches
p162
aVare the result of my studying the effects
p163
aVof ink spread on cheap paper
p164
aVand reacting, revising the font accordingly.
p165
aVThese strange artifacts are designed to compensate
p166
aVfor the undesirable effects of scale
p167
aVand production process.
p168
aVAt the outset, AT&T had wanted
p169
aVto set the phone books in Helvetica,
p170
aVbut as my friend Erik Spiekermann said
p171
aVin the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,
p172
aVthe letters in Helvetica were designed to be
p173
aVas similar to one another as possible.
p174
aVThis is not the recipe for legibility at small size.
p175
aVIt looks very elegant up on a slide.
p176
aVI had to disambiguate these forms
p177
aVof the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial
p178
aVby sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see
p179
aVin the bottom part of that slide.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo now we're on to the mid-'80s,
p182
aVthe early days of digital outline fonts,
p183
aVvector technology.
p184
aVThere was an issue at that time
p185
aVwith the size of the fonts,
p186
aVthe amount of data that was required to find
p187
aVand store a font in computer memory.
p188
aVIt limited the number of fonts you could get
p189
aVon your typesetting system at any one time.
p190
aVI did an analysis of the data,
p191
aVand found that a typical serif face
p192
aVyou see on the left
p193
aVneeded nearly twice as much data
p194
aVas a sans serif in the middle
p195
aVbecause of all the points required
p196
aVto define the elegantly curved serif brackets.
p197
aVThe numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,
p198
aVthey represent the amount of data
p199
aVneeded to store each of the fonts.
p200
aVSo the sans serif, in the middle,
p201
aVsans the serifs, was much more economical,
p202
aV81 to 151.
p203
aa(lp204
V"Aha," I thought. "The engineers have a problem.
p205
aVDesigner to the rescue."
p206
aa(lp207
VI made a serif type, you can see it on the right,
p208
aVwithout curved serifs.
p209
aVI made them polygonal, out of straight line segments,
p210
aVchamfered brackets.
p211
aVAnd look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
p212
aVWe call it Charter, on the right.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo I went to the head of engineering
p215
aVwith my numbers, and I said proudly,
p216
aV"I have solved your problem."
p217
aa(lp218
V"Oh," he said. "What problem?"
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd I said, "Well, you know, the problem
p221
aVof the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on."
p222
aa(lp223
V"Oh," he said. "We solved that problem last week.
p224
aVWe wrote a compaction routine that reduces
p225
aVthe size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.
p226
aVYou can have as many fonts on your system
p227
aVas you like."
p228
aa(lp229
V"Well, thank you for letting me know," I said.
p230
aa(lp231
VFoiled again.
p232
aVI was left with a design solution
p233
aVfor a nonexistent technical problem.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me.
p236
aVI didn't just throw my design away
p237
aVin a fit of pique.
p238
aVI persevered.
p239
aVWhat had started as a technical exercise
p240
aVbecame an aesthetic exercise, really.
p241
aVIn other words, I had come to like this typeface.
p242
aVForget its origins. Screw that.
p243
aVI liked the design for its own sake.
p244
aVThe simplified forms of Charter
p245
aVgave it a sort of plain-spoken quality
p246
aVand unfussy spareness
p247
aVthat sort of pleased me.
p248
aVYou know, at times of technical innovation,
p249
aVdesigners want to be influenced
p250
aVby what's in the air.
p251
aVWe want to respond. We want to be pushed
p252
aVinto exploring something new.
p253
aVSo Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.
p254
aVIn the end, there was no hard and fast causal link
p255
aVbetween the technology and the design of Charter.
p256
aVI had really misunderstood the technology.
p257
aVThe technology did suggest something to me,
p258
aVbut it did not force my hand,
p259
aVand I think this happens very often.
p260
aa(lp261
VYou know, engineers are very smart,
p262
aVand despite occasional frustrations
p263
aVbecause I'm less smart,
p264
aVI've always enjoyed working with them
p265
aVand learning from them.
p266
aVApropos, in the mid-'90s,
p267
aVI started talking to Microsoft
p268
aVabout screen fonts.
p269
aVUp to that point, all the fonts on screen
p270
aVhad been adapted from previously existing
p271
aVprinting fonts, of course.
p272
aVBut Microsoft foresaw correctly
p273
aVthe movement, the stampede
p274
aVtowards electronic communication,
p275
aVto reading and writing onscreen
p276
aVwith the printed output as being sort of secondary
p277
aVin importance.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo the priorities were just tipping at that point.
p280
aVThey wanted a small core set of fonts
p281
aVthat were not adapted but designed for the screen
p282
aVto face up to the problems of screen,
p283
aVwhich were their coarse resolution displays.
p284
aVI said to Microsoft, a typeface designed
p285
aVfor a particular technology
p286
aVis a self-obsoleting typeface.
p287
aVI've designed too many faces in the past
p288
aVthat were intended to mitigate technical problems.
p289
aVThanks to the engineers, the technical problems went away.
p290
aVSo did my typeface.
p291
aVIt was only a stopgap.
p292
aVMicrosoft came back to say that
p293
aVaffordable computer monitors
p294
aVwith better resolutions
p295
aVwere at least a decade away.
p296
aVSo I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,
p297
aVthat's more than a stopgap.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo I was persuaded, I was convinced,
p300
aVand we went to work on what became Verdana
p301
aVand Georgia,
p302
aVfor the first time working not on paper
p303
aVbut directly onto the screen from the pixel up.
p304
aVAt that time, screens were binary.
p305
aVThe pixel was either on or it was off.
p306
aVHere you see the outline of a letter,
p307
aVthe cap H,
p308
aVwhich is the thin black line, the contour,
p309
aVwhich is how it is stored in memory,
p310
aVsuperimposed on the bitmap,
p311
aVwhich is the grey area,
p312
aVwhich is how it's displayed on the screen.
p313
aVThe bitmap is rasterized from the outline.
p314
aVHere in a cap H, which is all straight lines,
p315
aVthe two are in almost perfect sync
p316
aVon the Cartesian grid.
p317
aVNot so with an O.
p318
aVThis looks more like bricklaying than type design,
p319
aVbut believe me, this is a good bitmap O,
p320
aVfor the simple reason that it's symmetrical
p321
aVin both x and y axes.
p322
aVIn a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask
p323
aVfor more than that.
p324
aVI would sometimes make, I don't know,
p325
aVthree or four different versions of a difficult letter
p326
aVlike a lowercase A,
p327
aVand then stand back to choose which was the best.
p328
aVWell, there was no best,
p329
aVso the designer's judgment comes in
p330
aVin trying to decide
p331
aVwhich is the least bad.
p332
aVIs that a compromise?
p333
aVNot to me, if you are working
p334
aVat the highest standard the technology will allow,
p335
aValthough that standard may be
p336
aVwell short of the ideal.
p337
aVYou may be able to see on this slide
p338
aVtwo different bitmap fonts there.
p339
aVThe "a" in the upper one, I think,
p340
aVis better than the "a" in the lower one,
p341
aVbut it still ain't great.
p342
aVYou can maybe see the effect better
p343
aVif it's reduced. Well, maybe not.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,
p346
aVout of necessity.
p347
aVFor a certain kind of temperament,
p348
aVthere is a certain kind of satisfaction
p349
aVin doing something that cannot be perfect
p350
aVbut can still be done to the best of your ability.
p351
aVHere's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.
p352
aVThe bitmap looks jagged and rough.
p353
aVIt is jagged and rough.
p354
aVBut I discovered, by experiment,
p355
aVthat there is an optimum slant
p356
aVfor an italic on a screen
p357
aVso the strokes break well
p358
aVat the pixel boundaries.
p359
aVLook in this example how, rough as it is,
p360
aVhow the left and right legs
p361
aVactually break at the same level.
p362
aVThat's a victory. That's good, right there.
p363
aVAnd of course, at the lower depths,
p364
aVyou don't get much choice.
p365
aVThis is an S, in case you were wondering.
p366
aa(lp367
VWell, it's been 18 years now
p368
aVsince Verdana and Georgia were released.
p369
aVMicrosoft were absolutely right,
p370
aVit took a good 10 years,
p371
aVbut screen displays now do have
p372
aVimproved spatial resolution,
p373
aVand very much improved photometric resolution
p374
aVthanks to anti-aliasing and so on.
p375
aVSo now that their mission is accomplished,
p376
aVhas that meant the demise
p377
aVof the screen fonts that I designed
p378
aVfor coarser displays back then?
p379
aVWill they outlive the now-obsolete screens
p380
aVand the flood of new web fonts
p381
aVcoming on to the market?
p382
aVOr have they established their own
p383
aVsort of evolutionary niche
p384
aVthat is independent of technology?
p385
aVIn other words, have they been absorbed
p386
aVinto the typographic mainstream?
p387
aVI'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.
p388
aVHey, 18 is a good age for anything
p389
aVwith present-day rates of attrition,
p390
aVso I'm not complaining.
p391
aa(lp392
