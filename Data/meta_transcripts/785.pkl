VI grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
p4
aVIn high school, I took a bus to school
p5
aVan hour each way every day.
p6
aVAnd I was always absorbed in a book,
p7
aVscience fiction book,
p8
aVwhich took my mind to other worlds,
p9
aVand satisfied, in a narrative form,
p10
aVthis insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd you know, that curiosity also manifested itself
p13
aVin the fact that whenever I wasn't in school
p14
aVI was out in the woods,
p15
aVhiking and taking "samples" \u2014
p16
aVfrogs and snakes and bugs and pond water \u2014
p17
aVand bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.
p18
aVYou know, I was a real science geek.
p19
aVBut it was all about trying to understand the world,
p20
aVunderstand the limits of possibility.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd my love of science fiction
p23
aVactually seemed mirrored in the world around me,
p24
aVbecause what was happening, this was in the late '60s,
p25
aVwe were going to the moon,
p26
aVwe were exploring the deep oceans.
p27
aVJacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms
p28
aVwith his amazing specials that showed us
p29
aVanimals and places and a wondrous world
p30
aVthat we could never really have previously imagined.
p31
aVSo, that seemed to resonate
p32
aVwith the whole science fiction part of it.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I was an artist.
p35
aVI could draw. I could paint.
p36
aVAnd I found that because there weren't video games
p37
aVand this saturation of CG movies and all of this
p38
aVimagery in the media landscape,
p39
aVI had to create these images in my head.
p40
aVYou know, we all did, as kids having to
p41
aVread a book, and through the author's description,
p42
aVput something on the movie screen in our heads.
p43
aVAnd so, my response to this was to paint, to draw
p44
aValien creatures, alien worlds,
p45
aVrobots, spaceships, all that stuff.
p46
aVI was endlessly getting busted in math class
p47
aVdoodling behind the textbook.
p48
aVThat was \u2014 the creativity
p49
aVhad to find its outlet somehow.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows
p52
aVactually got me very excited about the fact that there was
p53
aVan alien world right here on Earth.
p54
aVI might not really go to an alien world
p55
aVon a spaceship someday \u2014
p56
aVthat seemed pretty darn unlikely.
p57
aVBut that was a world I could really go to,
p58
aVright here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic
p59
aVas anything that I had imagined
p60
aVfrom reading these books.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver
p63
aVat the age of 15.
p64
aVAnd the only problem with that was that I lived
p65
aVin a little village in Canada,
p66
aV600 miles from the nearest ocean.
p67
aVBut I didn't let that daunt me.
p68
aVI pestered my father until he finally found
p69
aVa scuba class in Buffalo, New York,
p70
aVright across the border from where we live.
p71
aVAnd I actually got certified
p72
aVin a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter
p73
aVin Buffalo, New York.
p74
aVAnd I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,
p75
aVfor another two years,
p76
aVuntil we moved to California.
p77
aa(lp78
VSince then, in the intervening
p79
aV40 years,
p80
aVI've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,
p81
aVand 500 hours of that was in submersibles.
p82
aVAnd I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,
p83
aVand even the shallow oceans,
p84
aVare so rich with amazing life
p85
aVthat really is beyond our imagination.
p86
aVNature's imagination is so boundless
p87
aVcompared to our own
p88
aVmeager human imagination.
p89
aVI still, to this day, stand in absolute awe
p90
aVof what I see when I make these dives.
p91
aVAnd my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,
p92
aVand just as strong as it ever was.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut when I chose a career as an adult,
p95
aVit was filmmaking.
p96
aVAnd that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
p97
aVthis urge I had to tell stories
p98
aVwith my urges to create images.
p99
aVAnd I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
p100
aVSo, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories
p101
aVtogether, and that made sense.
p102
aVAnd of course the stories that I chose to tell
p103
aVwere science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"
p104
aVand "The Abyss."
p105
aVAnd with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love
p106
aVof underwater and diving with filmmaking.
p107
aVSo, you know, merging the two passions.
p108
aa(lp109
VSomething interesting came out of "The Abyss,"
p110
aVwhich was that to solve a specific narrative
p111
aVproblem on that film,
p112
aVwhich was to create this kind of liquid water creature,
p113
aVwe actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.
p114
aVAnd this resulted in the first soft-surface
p115
aVcharacter, CG animation
p116
aVthat was ever in a movie.
p117
aVAnd even though the film didn't make any money \u2014
p118
aVbarely broke even, I should say \u2014
p119
aVI witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,
p120
aVthe global audience, was mesmerized
p121
aVby this apparent magic.
p122
aa(lp123
VYou know, it's Arthur Clarke's law
p124
aVthat any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
p125
aVThey were seeing something magical.
p126
aVAnd so that got me very excited.
p127
aVAnd I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced
p128
aVinto the cinematic art."
p129
aVSo, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,
p130
aVwe took that much farther.
p131
aVWorking with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude
p132
aVin that film. The success hung in the balance
p133
aVon whether that effect would work.
p134
aVAnd it did, and we created magic again,
p135
aVand we had the same result with an audience \u2014
p136
aValthough we did make a little more money on that one.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, drawing a line through those two dots
p139
aVof experience
p140
aVcame to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"
p141
aVthis was a whole new world of creativity
p142
aVfor film artists.
p143
aVSo, I started a company with Stan Winston,
p144
aVmy good friend Stan Winston,
p145
aVwho is the premier make-up and creature designer
p146
aVat that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
p147
aVAnd the concept of the company was
p148
aVthat we would leapfrog past
p149
aVthe analog processes of optical printers and so on,
p150
aVand we would go right to digital production.
p151
aVAnd we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s
p154
aVin the creature and character design stuff
p155
aVthat we had actually founded the company to do.
p156
aVSo, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"
p157
aVwhich was meant to absolutely push the envelope
p158
aVof visual effects,
p159
aVof CG effects, beyond,
p160
aVwith realistic human emotive characters
p161
aVgenerated in CG,
p162
aVand the main characters would all be in CG,
p163
aVand the world would be in CG.
p164
aVAnd the envelope pushed back,
p165
aVand I was told by the folks at my company
p166
aVthat we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVYou know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:
p171
aV"It's going to be this epic romance,
p172
aVpassionate film."
p173
aVSecretly, what I wanted to do was
p174
aVI wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."
p175
aVAnd that's why I made the movie.
p176
aV(Applause)
p177
aVAnd that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.
p178
aVBut I convinced them. I said,
p179
aV"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.
p180
aVWe'll be using it in the opening of the film.
p181
aVIt will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."
p182
aVAnd I talked them into funding an expedition.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VSounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme
p186
aVabout your imagination creating a reality.
p187
aVBecause we actually created a reality where six months later,
p188
aVI find myself in a Russian submersible
p189
aVtwo and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,
p190
aVlooking at the real Titanic through a view port.
p191
aVNot a movie, not HD \u2014 for real.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, that blew my mind.
p195
aVAnd it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras
p196
aVand lights and all kinds of things.
p197
aVBut, it struck me how much
p198
aVthis dive, these deep dives,
p199
aVwas like a space mission.
p200
aVYou know, where it was highly technical,
p201
aVand it required enormous planning.
p202
aVYou get in this capsule, you go down to this dark
p203
aVhostile environment
p204
aVwhere there is no hope of rescue
p205
aVif you can't get back by yourself.
p206
aVAnd I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,
p207
aVliving in a science fiction movie.
p208
aVThis is really cool."
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
p211
aVOf course, the curiosity, the science component of it \u2014
p212
aVit was everything. It was adventure,
p213
aVit was curiosity, it was imagination.
p214
aVAnd it was an experience that
p215
aVHollywood couldn't give me.
p216
aVBecause, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could
p217
aVcreate a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing
p218
aVout that window.
p219
aVAs we did some of our subsequent expeditions,
p220
aVI was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents
p221
aVand sometimes things that I had never seen before,
p222
aVsometimes things that no one had seen before,
p223
aVthat actually were not described by science
p224
aVat the time that we saw them and imaged them.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo, I was completely smitten by this,
p227
aVand had to do more.
p228
aVAnd so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
p229
aVAfter the success of "Titanic,"
p230
aVI said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job
p231
aVas a Hollywood movie maker,
p232
aVand I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."
p233
aVAnd so, we started planning these
p234
aVexpeditions.
p235
aVAnd we wound up going to the Bismark,
p236
aVand exploring it with robotic vehicles.
p237
aVWe went back to the Titanic wreck.
p238
aVWe took little bots that we had created
p239
aVthat spooled a fiber optic.
p240
aVAnd the idea was to go in and do an interior
p241
aVsurvey of that ship, which had never been done.
p242
aVNobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,
p243
aVso we created technology to do it.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, you know, here I am now, on the deck
p246
aVof Titanic, sitting in a submersible,
p247
aVand looking out at planks that look much like this,
p248
aVwhere I knew that the band had played.
p249
aVAnd I'm flying a little robotic vehicle
p250
aVthrough the corridor of the ship.
p251
aVWhen I say, "I'm operating it,"
p252
aVbut my mind is in the vehicle.
p253
aVI felt like I was physically present
p254
aVinside the shipwreck of Titanic.
p255
aVAnd it was the most surreal kind
p256
aVof deja vu experience I've ever had,
p257
aVbecause I would know before I turned a corner
p258
aVwhat was going to be there before the lights
p259
aVof the vehicle actually revealed it,
p260
aVbecause I had walked the set for months
p261
aVwhen we were making the movie.
p262
aVAnd the set was based as an exact replica
p263
aVon the blueprints of the ship.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
p266
aVAnd it really made me realize that
p267
aVthe telepresence experience \u2014
p268
aVthat you actually can have these robotic avatars,
p269
aVthen your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,
p270
aVinto this other form of existence.
p271
aVIt was really, really quite profound.
p272
aVAnd it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening
p273
aVsome decades out
p274
aVas we start to have cyborg bodies
p275
aVfor exploration or for other means
p276
aVin many sort of
p277
aVpost-human futures
p278
aVthat I can imagine,
p279
aVas a science fiction fan.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo, having done these expeditions,
p282
aVand really beginning to appreciate what was down there,
p283
aVsuch as at the deep ocean vents
p284
aVwhere we had these amazing, amazing animals \u2014
p285
aVthey're basically aliens right here on Earth.
p286
aVThey live in an environment of chemosynthesis.
p287
aVThey don't survive on sunlight-based
p288
aVsystem the way we do.
p289
aVAnd so, you're seeing animals that are living next to
p290
aVa 500-degree-Centigrade
p291
aVwater plumes.
p292
aVYou think they can't possibly exist.
p293
aa(lp294
VAt the same time
p295
aVI was getting very interested in space science as well \u2014
p296
aVagain, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
p297
aVAnd I wound up getting involved with
p298
aVthe space community,
p299
aVreally involved with NASA,
p300
aVsitting on the NASA advisory board,
p301
aVplanning actual space missions,
p302
aVgoing to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut
p303
aVbiomedical protocols,
p304
aVand all these sorts of things,
p305
aVto actually go and fly to the international space station
p306
aVwith our 3D camera systems.
p307
aVAnd this was fascinating.
p308
aVBut what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists
p309
aVwith us into the deep.
p310
aVAnd taking them down so that they had access \u2014
p311
aVastrobiologists, planetary scientists,
p312
aVpeople who were interested in these extreme environments \u2014
p313
aVtaking them down to the vents, and letting them see,
p314
aVand take samples and test instruments, and so on.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo, here we were making documentary films,
p317
aVbut actually doing science,
p318
aVand actually doing space science.
p319
aVI'd completely closed the loop
p320
aVbetween being the science fiction fan,
p321
aVyou know, as a kid,
p322
aVand doing this stuff for real.
p323
aVAnd you know, along the way in this journey
p324
aVof discovery,
p325
aVI learned a lot.
p326
aVI learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot
p327
aVabout leadership.
p328
aVNow you think director has got to be a leader,
p329
aVleader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.
p330
aa(lp331
VI didn't really learn about leadership
p332
aVuntil I did these expeditions.
p333
aVBecause I had to, at a certain point, say,
p334
aV"What am I doing out here?
p335
aVWhy am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
p336
aVWe don't make money at these damn shows.
p337
aVWe barely break even. There is no fame in it.
p338
aVPeople sort of think I went away
p339
aVbetween "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails
p340
aVsomeplace, sitting at the beach.
p341
aVMade all these films, made all these documentary films
p342
aVfor a very limited audience.
p343
aa(lp344
VNo fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?
p345
aVYou're doing it for the task itself,
p346
aVfor the challenge \u2014
p347
aVand the ocean is the most challenging environment there is \u2014
p348
aVfor the thrill of discovery,
p349
aVand for that strange bond that happens
p350
aVwhen a small group of people form a tightly knit team.
p351
aVBecause we would do these things with 10, 12 people,
p352
aVworking for years at a time,
p353
aVsometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd in that bond, you realize
p356
aVthat the most important thing
p357
aVis the respect that you have for them
p358
aVand that they have for you, that you've done a task
p359
aVthat you can't explain to someone else.
p360
aVWhen you come back to the shore and you say,
p361
aV"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,
p362
aVand the this and the that,
p363
aVall the technology of it, and the difficulty,
p364
aVthe human-performance aspects of working at sea,"
p365
aVyou can't explain it to people. It's that thing that
p366
aVmaybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together
p367
aVand they know they can never explain it.
p368
aVCreates a bond, creates a bond of respect.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo, when I came back to make my next movie,
p371
aVwhich was "Avatar,"
p372
aVI tried to apply that same principle of leadership,
p373
aVwhich is that you respect your team,
p374
aVand you earn their respect in return.
p375
aVAnd it really changed the dynamic.
p376
aVSo, here I was again with a small team,
p377
aVin uncharted territory,
p378
aVdoing "Avatar," coming up with new technology
p379
aVthat didn't exist before.
p380
aVTremendously exciting.
p381
aVTremendously challenging.
p382
aVAnd we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.
p383
aVAnd it completely changed how I do movies.
p384
aVSo, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,
p385
aVyou brought back the ocean organisms
p386
aVand put them on the planet of Pandora."
p387
aVTo me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,
p388
aVthe process itself, that changed as a result of that.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo, what can we synthesize out of all this?
p391
aVYou know, what are the lessons learned?
p392
aVWell, I think number one is
p393
aVcuriosity.
p394
aVIt's the most powerful thing you own.
p395
aVImagination is a force
p396
aVthat can actually manifest a reality.
p397
aVAnd the respect of your team
p398
aVis more important than all the
p399
aVlaurels in the world.
p400
aVI have young filmmakers
p401
aVcome up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."
p402
aVAnd I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
p403
aVOther people will do that for you \u2014 don't do it to yourself,
p404
aVdon't bet against yourself,
p405
aVand take risks."
p406
aa(lp407
VNASA has this phrase that they like:
p408
aV"Failure is not an option."
p409
aVBut failure has to be an option
p410
aVin art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
p411
aVAnd no important endeavor
p412
aVthat required innovation
p413
aVwas done without risk.
p414
aVYou have to be willing to take those risks.
p415
aVSo, that's the thought I would leave you with,
p416
aVis that in whatever you're doing,
p417
aVfailure is an option,
p418
aVbut fear is not. Thank you.
