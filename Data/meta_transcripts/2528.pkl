VAs a little Hawaiian,
p4
aVmy mom and auntie always told me stories about Kalaupapa \u2014
p5
aVthe Hawaiian leper colony
p6
aVsurrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world \u2014
p7
aVand Father Damien,
p8
aVthe Belgian missionary who gave his life for the Hawaiian community.
p9
aVAs a young nurse,
p10
aVmy aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers
p11
aValmost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy.
p12
aVI remember stories she told
p13
aVabout traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule,
p14
aVwhile my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele
p15
aVall the way down to Kalaupapa.
p16
aa(lp17
VYou see, as a youngster,
p18
aVI was always curious about a few things.
p19
aVFirst was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation
p20
aVin Kalaupapa,
p21
aVknowing he would inevitably contract leprosy
p22
aVfrom the community of people he sought to help.
p23
aVAnd secondly,
p24
aVwhere did the leprosy bacteria come from?
p25
aVAnd why were K\u0101naka Maoli,
p26
aVthe indigenous people of Hawaii,
p27
aVso susceptible to developing leprosy, or "mai Pake?"
p28
aa(lp29
VThis got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawaiians \u2014
p30
aVnamely, our genetic makeup.
p31
aVBut it wasn't until high school,
p32
aVthrough the Human Genome Project,
p33
aVthat I realized I wasn't alone
p34
aVin trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry
p35
aVto our potential health, wellness and illness.
p36
aVYou see,
p37
aVthe 2.7 billion-dollar project
p38
aVpromised an era of predictive and preventative medicine
p39
aVbased on our unique genetic makeup.
p40
aVSo to me it always seemed obvious
p41
aVthat in order to achieve this dream,
p42
aVwe would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people
p43
aVto obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet.
p44
aVThat's why 10 years later,
p45
aVit continues to shock me,
p46
aVknowing that 96 percent of genome studies
p47
aVassociating common genetic variation with specific diseases
p48
aVhave focused exclusively on individuals of European ancestry.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow you don't need a PhD
p51
aVto see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity.
p52
aVAnd in my own searching,
p53
aVI've discovered that far less than one percent
p54
aVhave actually focused on indigenous communities, like myself.
p55
aVSo that begs the question:
p56
aVWho is the Human Genome Project actually for?
p57
aVJust like we have different colored eyes and hair,
p58
aVwe metabolize drugs differently
p59
aVbased on the variation in our genomes.
p60
aVSo how many of you would be shocked to learn
p61
aVthat 95 percent of clinical trials
p62
aVhave also exclusively featured individuals of European ancestry?
p63
aa(lp64
VThis bias
p65
aVand systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people
p66
aVin both clinical trials and genome studies
p67
aVis partially the result of a history of distrust.
p68
aVFor example,
p69
aVin 1989, researchers from Arizona State University
p70
aVobtained blood samples from Arizona's Havasupai tribe,
p71
aVpromising to alleviate the burden of type 2 diabetes
p72
aVthat was plaguing their community,
p73
aVonly to turn around and use those exact same samples \u2014
p74
aVwithout the Havasupai's consent \u2014
p75
aVto study rates of schizophrenia, inbreeding,
p76
aVand challenge the Havasupai's origin story.
p77
aVWhen the Havasupai found out,
p78
aVthey sued successfully for $700,000,
p79
aVand they banned ASU from conducting research on their reservation.
p80
aVThis culminated in a sort of domino effect
p81
aVwith local tribes in the Southwest \u2014
p82
aVincluding the Navajo Nation,
p83
aVone of the largest tribes in the country \u2014
p84
aVputting a moratorium on genetic research.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow despite this history of distrust,
p87
aVI still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research.
p88
aVAnd if we don't do something soon,
p89
aVthe gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen.
p90
aVHawaii, for example,
p91
aVhas the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the US,
p92
aVyet native Hawaiians like myself
p93
aVdie a full decade before our non-native counterparts,
p94
aVbecause we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,
p95
aVobesity,
p96
aVand the number one and number two killers in the US:
p97
aVcardiovascular disease and cancer.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo how do we ensure
p100
aVthe populations of people that need genome sequencing the most
p101
aVare not the last to benefit?
p102
aVMy vision is to make genetic research more native,
p103
aVto indigenize genome sequencing technology.
p104
aa(lp105
VTraditionally, genomes are sequenced in laboratories.
p106
aVHere's an image of your classic genome sequencer.
p107
aVIt's huge.
p108
aVIt's the size of a refrigerator.
p109
aVThere's this obvious physical limitation.
p110
aVBut what if you could sequence genomes on the fly?
p111
aVWhat if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket?
p112
aVThis nanopore-based sequencer
p113
aVis one 10,000th the size of your traditional genome sequencer.
p114
aVIt doesn't have the same physical limitations,
p115
aVin that it's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords,
p116
aVlarge vats of chemicals or computer monitors.
p117
aVIt allows us to de-black box genome sequencing technology development
p118
aVin a way that's immersive and collaborative,
p119
aVactivating and empowering indigenous communities ...
p120
aVas citizen scientists.
p121
aa(lp122
V100 years later in Kalaupapa,
p123
aVwe now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time,
p124
aVusing mobile genome sequencers,
p125
aVremote access to the Internet
p126
aVand cloud computation.
p127
aVBut only if that's what Hawaiian people want.
p128
aVIn our space,
p129
aVon our terms.
p130
aa(lp131
VIndiGenomics is about science for the people by the people.
p132
aVWe'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource,
p133
aVfocused on educating indigenous communities
p134
aVon the potential use and misuse of genetic information.
p135
aVEventually we'd like to have our own IndiGenomics research institute
p136
aVto conduct our own experiments
p137
aVand educate the next generation of indigenous scientists.
p138
aa(lp139
VIn the end,
p140
aVindigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research.
p141
aVAnd for those on the outside,
p142
aVjust as Father Damien did,
p143
aVthe research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture
p144
aVor die trying.
p145
