VWhat is it that French people do better than all the others?
p4
aVIf you would take polls,
p5
aVthe top three answers might be:
p6
aVlove, wine and whining.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VMaybe.
p11
aVBut let me suggest a fourth one:
p12
aVmathematics.
p13
aVDid you know that Paris has more mathematicians
p14
aVthan any other city in the world?
p15
aVAnd more streets with mathematicians' names, too.
p16
aVAnd if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal,
p17
aVoften called the Nobel Prize for mathematics,
p18
aVand always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40,
p19
aVyou will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant
p20
aVthan any other country.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhat is it that we find so sexy in math?
p23
aVAfter all, it seems to be dull and abstract,
p24
aVjust numbers and computations and rules to apply.
p25
aVMathematics may be abstract,
p26
aVbut it's not dull
p27
aVand it's not about computing.
p28
aVIt is about reasoning
p29
aVand proving our core activity.
p30
aVIt is about imagination,
p31
aVthe talent which we most praise.
p32
aVIt is about finding the truth.
p33
aVThere's nothing like the feeling which invades you
p34
aVwhen after months of hard thinking,
p35
aVyou finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem.
p36
aVThe great mathematician André Weil likened this \u2014
p37
aVno kidding \u2014
p38
aVto sexual pleasure.
p39
aVBut noted that this feeling can last for hours, or even days.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe reward may be big.
p42
aVHidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world.
p43
aVThey are inaccessible to our senses
p44
aVbut can be seen through mathematical lenses.
p45
aVClose your eyes for moment
p46
aVand think of what is occurring right now around you.
p47
aVInvisible particles from the air around are bumping on you
p48
aVby the billions and billions at each second,
p49
aVall in complete chaos.
p50
aVAnd still,
p51
aVtheir statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics.
p52
aVAnd open your eyes now
p53
aVto the statistics of the velocities of these particles.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,
p56
aVor the Law of Errors \u2014
p57
aVof deviations with respect to the mean behavior.
p58
aVThis curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles
p59
aVin the same way as a demographic curve
p60
aVwould tell about the statistics of ages of individuals.
p61
aVIt's one of the most important curves ever.
p62
aVIt keeps on occurring again and again,
p63
aVfrom many theories and many experiments,
p64
aVas a great example of the universality
p65
aVwhich is so dear to us mathematicians.
p66
aa(lp67
VOf this curve,
p68
aVthe famous scientist Francis Galton said,
p69
aV"It would have been deified by the Greeks if they had known it.
p70
aVIt is the supreme law of unreason."
p71
aVAnd there's no better way to materialize that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.
p72
aVInside this board are narrow tunnels
p73
aVthrough which tiny balls will fall down randomly,
p74
aVgoing right or left, or left, etc.
p75
aVAll in complete randomness and chaos.
p76
aVLet's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Board shaking)
p79
aa(lp80
VThis is a bit of a sport,
p81
aVbecause we need to resolve some traffic jams in there.
p82
aVAha.
p83
aVWe think that randomness is going to play me a trick on stage.
p84
aa(lp85
VThere it is.
p86
aVOur supreme goddess of unreason.
p87
aVthe Gauss Curve,
p88
aVtrapped here inside this transparent box as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.
p89
aVFor you I have shown it,
p90
aVbut to my students I explain why it could not be any other curve.
p91
aVAnd this is touching the mystery of that goddess,
p92
aVreplacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation.
p93
aa(lp94
VAll of science is like this.
p95
aVAnd beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure.
p96
aVThey also change our vision of the world.
p97
aVFor instance,
p98
aVEinstein,
p99
aVPerrin,
p100
aVSmoluchowski,
p101
aVthey used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories
p102
aVand the Gauss Curve
p103
aVto explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt was not the first time
p106
aVthat mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world.
p107
aVMore than 2,000 years ago,
p108
aVat the time of the ancient Greeks,
p109
aVit already occurred.
p110
aVIn those days,
p111
aVonly a small fraction of the world had been explored,
p112
aVand the Earth might have seemed infinite.
p113
aVBut clever Eratosthenes,
p114
aVusing mathematics,
p115
aVwas able to measure the Earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent.
p116
aa(lp117
VHere's another example.
p118
aVIn 1673, Jean Richer noticed
p119
aVthat a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris.
p120
aVFrom this observation alone, and clever mathematics,
p121
aVNewton rightly deduced
p122
aVthat the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles,
p123
aVlike 0.3 percent \u2014
p124
aVso tiny that you wouldn't even notice it on the real view of the Earth.
p125
aa(lp126
VThese stories show that mathematics
p127
aVis able to make us go out of our intuition
p128
aVmeasure the Earth which seems infinite,
p129
aVsee atoms which are invisible
p130
aVor detect an imperceptible variation of shape.
p131
aVAnd if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk,
p132
aVit is this:
p133
aVmathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition
p134
aVand explore territories which do not fit within our grasp.
p135
aa(lp136
VHere's a modern example you will all relate to:
p137
aVsearching the Internet.
p138
aVThe World Wide Web,
p139
aVmore than one billion web pages \u2014
p140
aVdo you want to go through them all?
p141
aVComputing power helps,
p142
aVbut it would be useless without the mathematical modeling
p143
aVto find the information hidden in the data.
p144
aa(lp145
VLet's work out a baby problem.
p146
aVImagine that you're a detective working on a crime case,
p147
aVand there are many people who have their version of the facts.
p148
aVWho do you want to interview first?
p149
aVSensible answer:
p150
aVprime witnesses.
p151
aVYou see,
p152
aVsuppose that there is person number seven,
p153
aVtells you a story,
p154
aVbut when you ask where he got if from,
p155
aVhe points to person number three as a source.
p156
aVAnd maybe person number three, in turn,
p157
aVpoints at person number one as the primary source.
p158
aVNow number one is a prime witness,
p159
aVso I definitely want to interview him \u2014 priority.
p160
aVAnd from the graph
p161
aVwe also see that person number four is a prime witness.
p162
aVAnd maybe I even want to interview him first,
p163
aVbecause there are more people who refer to him.
p164
aa(lp165
VOK, that was easy,
p166
aVbut now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify?
p167
aVAnd this graph,
p168
aVI may think of it as all people who testify in a complicated crime case,
p169
aVbut it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other,
p170
aVreferring to each other for contents.
p171
aVWhich ones are the most authoritative?
p172
aVNot so clear.
p173
aa(lp174
VEnter PageRank,
p175
aVone of the early cornerstones of Google.
p176
aVThis algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness
p177
aVto determine automatically the most relevant web pages,
p178
aVin the same way as we used randomness in the Galton Board experiment.
p179
aVSo let's send into this graph
p180
aVa bunch of tiny, digital marbles
p181
aVand let them go randomly through the graph.
p182
aVEach time they arrive at some site,
p183
aVthey will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one.
p184
aVAnd again, and again, and again.
p185
aVAnd with small, growing piles,
p186
aVwe'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited
p187
aVby these digital marbles.
p188
aa(lp189
VHere we go.
p190
aVRandomness, randomness.
p191
aVAnd from time to time,
p192
aValso let's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd look at this:
p195
aVfrom the chaos will emerge the solution.
p196
aVThe highest piles correspond to those sites
p197
aVwhich somehow are better connected than the others,
p198
aVmore pointed at than the others.
p199
aVAnd here we see clearly
p200
aVwhich are the web pages we want to first try.
p201
aVOnce again,
p202
aVthe solution emerges from the randomness.
p203
aVOf course, since that time,
p204
aVGoogle has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms,
p205
aVbut already this was beautiful.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd still,
p208
aVjust one problem in a million.
p209
aVWith the advent of digital area,
p210
aVmore and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis,
p211
aVmaking the job of mathematician a more and more useful one,
p212
aVto the extent that a few years ago,
p213
aVit was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs
p214
aVin a study about the best and worst jobs
p215
aVpublished by the Wall Street Journal in 2009.
p216
aa(lp217
VMathematician \u2014
p218
aVbest job in the world.
p219
aVThat's because of the applications:
p220
aVcommunication theory,
p221
aVinformation theory,
p222
aVgame theory,
p223
aVcompressed sensing,
p224
aVmachine learning,
p225
aVgraph analysis,
p226
aVharmonic analysis.
p227
aVAnd why not stochastic processes,
p228
aVlinear programming,
p229
aVor fluid simulation?
p230
aVEach of these fields have monster industrial applications.
p231
aVAnd through them,
p232
aVthere is big money in mathematics.
p233
aVAnd let me concede
p234
aVthat when it comes to making money from the math,
p235
aVthe Americans are by a long shot the world champions,
p236
aVwith clever, emblematic billionaires and amazing, giant companies,
p237
aVall resting, ultimately, on good algorithm.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth,
p240
aVmathematics does look more sexy.
p241
aVBut don't you think
p242
aVthat the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one.
p243
aVIt is filled with perplexity,
p244
aVfrustration,
p245
aVa desperate fight for understanding.
p246
aa(lp247
VLet me evoke for you
p248
aVone of the most striking days in my mathematician's life.
p249
aVOr should I say,
p250
aVone of the most striking nights.
p251
aVAt that time,
p252
aVI was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton \u2014
p253
aVfor many years, the home of Albert Einstein
p254
aVand arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world.
p255
aVAnd that night I was working and working on an elusive proof,
p256
aVwhich was incomplete.
p257
aVIt was all about understanding
p258
aVthe paradoxical stability property of plasmas,
p259
aVwhich are a crowd of electrons.
p260
aVIn the perfect world of plasma,
p261
aVthere are no collisions
p262
aVand no friction to provide the stability like we are used to.
p263
aVBut still,
p264
aVif you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium,
p265
aVyou will find that the resulting electric field
p266
aVspontaneously vanishes,
p267
aVor damps out,
p268
aVas if by some mysterious friction force.
p269
aa(lp270
VThis paradoxical effect,
p271
aVcalled the Landau damping,
p272
aVis one of the most important in plasma physics,
p273
aVand it was discovered through mathematical ideas.
p274
aVBut still,
p275
aVa full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing.
p276
aVAnd together with my former student and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,
p277
aVin Paris at the time,
p278
aVwe had been working for months and months on such a proof.
p279
aVActually,
p280
aVI had already announced by mistake that we could solve it.
p281
aVBut the truth is,
p282
aVthe proof was just not working.
p283
aVIn spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments,
p284
aVand a bunch discoveries,
p285
aVand huge calculation,
p286
aVit was not working.
p287
aVAnd that night in Princeton,
p288
aVa certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy.
p289
aVI was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks,
p290
aVand still nothing was working.
p291
aV1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,
p292
aVnot working.
p293
aVAround 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.
p294
aVThen a few hours later,
p295
aVwaking up and go,
p296
aV"Ah, it's time to get the kids to school \u2014"
p297
aVWhat is this?
p298
aVThere was this voice in my head, I swear.
p299
aV"Take the second term to the other side,
p300
aVFourier transform and invert in L2."
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VDamn it,
p305
aVthat was the start of the solution!
p306
aa(lp307
VYou see,
p308
aVI thought I had taken some rest,
p309
aVbut really my brain had continued to work on it.
p310
aVIn those moments,
p311
aVyou don't think of your career or your colleagues,
p312
aVit's just a complete battle between the problem and you.
p313
aa(lp314
VThat being said,
p315
aVit does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work.
p316
aVAnd after we completed our huge analysis of the Landau damping,
p317
aVI was lucky enough
p318
aVto get the most coveted Fields Medal
p319
aVfrom the hands of the President of India,
p320
aVin Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 \u2014
p321
aVan honor that mathematicians never dare to dream,
p322
aVa day that I will remember until I live.
p323
aa(lp324
VWhat do you think,
p325
aVon such an occasion?
p326
aVPride, yes?
p327
aVAnd gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible.
p328
aVAnd because it was a collective adventure,
p329
aVyou need to share it, not just with your collaborators.
p330
aVI believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research,
p331
aVand share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it.
p332
aVAnd I've been working with my staff at Institut Henri Poincaré,
p333
aVtogether with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide,
p334
aVso that we can found our own, very special museum of mathematics there.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo in a few years,
p337
aVwhen you come to Paris,
p338
aVafter tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon,
p339
aVplease come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincaré,
p340
aVand share the mathematical dream with us.
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you.
