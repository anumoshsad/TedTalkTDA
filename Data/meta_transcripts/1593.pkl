VI'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,
p4
aVhow globalized we aren't,
p5
aVand why it's important to actually be accurate
p6
aVin making those kinds of assessments.
p7
aVAnd the leading point of view on this, whether measured
p8
aVby number of books sold, mentions in media,
p9
aVor surveys that I've run with groups ranging from
p10
aVmy students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,
p11
aVis this view that national borders
p12
aVreally don't matter very much anymore,
p13
aVcross-border integration is close to complete,
p14
aVand we live in one world.
p15
aVAnd what's interesting about this view
p16
aVis, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers
p17
aVlike Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,
p18
aVbut it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant
p19
aVglobalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives
p20
aVif it hasn't already done so.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
p23
aVI'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent
p24
aVsome time going back, trying to see the first mention
p25
aVof this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote
p26
aVthat I could find was one from David Livingstone,
p27
aVwriting in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,
p28
aVand the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly
p29
aVwith the rest of the world.
p30
aVNow clearly, David Livingstone
p31
aVwas a little bit ahead of his time,
p32
aVbut it does seem useful to ask ourselves,
p33
aV"Just how global are we?"
p34
aVbefore we think about where we go from here.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo the best way I've found of trying to get people
p37
aVto take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,
p38
aVmay not even be close to flat, is with some data.
p39
aVSo one of the things I've been doing over the last few years
p40
aVis really compiling data on things that could either happen
p41
aVwithin national borders or across national borders,
p42
aVand I've looked at the cross-border component
p43
aVas a percentage of the total.
p44
aVI'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,
p45
aVbut let me just give you a few data points.
p46
aVI'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,
p47
aVone kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,
p48
aVand, of course, trade in products and services.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo let's start off with plain old telephone service.
p51
aVOf all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,
p52
aVwhat percentage do you think were accounted for
p53
aVby cross-border phone calls?
p54
aVPick a percentage in your own mind.
p55
aVThe answer turns out to be two percent.
p56
aVIf you include Internet telephony, you might be able
p57
aVto push this number up to six or seven percent,
p58
aVbut it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
p59
aa(lp60
VOr let's turn to people moving across borders.
p61
aVOne particular thing we might look at, in terms of
p62
aVlong-term flows of people, is what percentage
p63
aVof the world's population is accounted for
p64
aVby first-generation immigrants?
p65
aVAgain, please pick a percentage.
p66
aVTurns out to be a little bit higher.
p67
aVIt's actually about three percent.
p68
aa(lp69
VOr think of investment. Take all the real investment
p70
aVthat went on in the world in 2010.
p71
aVWhat percentage of that was accounted for
p72
aVby foreign direct investment?
p73
aVNot quite ten percent.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd then finally, the one statistic
p76
aVthat I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:
p77
aVthe export-to-GDP ratio.
p78
aVIf you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate
p79
aVa little bit above 30 percent.
p80
aVHowever, there's a big problem with the official statistics,
p81
aVin that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier
p82
aVships something to China to be put into an iPod,
p83
aVand then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,
p84
aVthat component ends up getting counted multiple times.
p85
aVSo nobody knows how bad this bias
p86
aVwith the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would
p87
aVask the person who's spearheading the effort
p88
aVto generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,
p89
aVthe Director of the World Trade Organization,
p90
aVwhat his best guess would be
p91
aVof exports as a percentage of GDP,
p92
aVwithout the double- and triple-counting,
p93
aVand it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than
p94
aVthe 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo it's very clear that if you look at these numbers
p97
aVor all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,
p98
aV"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from
p99
aVthe no-border effect benchmark, which would imply
p100
aVinternationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
p101
aVSo clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors
p102
aVhave overstated the case.
p103
aVBut it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,
p104
aVwho are prone to this kind of overstatement.
p105
aVI've also spent some time surveying audiences
p106
aVin different parts of the world
p107
aVon what they actually guess these numbers to be.
p108
aVLet me share with you the results of a survey
p109
aVthat Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run
p110
aVof its readership as to what people's guesses
p111
aValong these dimensions actually were.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
p114
aVFirst of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
p115
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p116
aVSecond, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities
p117
aVwhose average value is less than 10 percent,
p118
aVyou have people guessing three, four times that level.
p119
aVEven though I'm an economist, I find that
p120
aVa pretty large error.
p121
aVAnd third, this is not just confined to the readers
p122
aVof the Harvard Business Review.
p123
aVI've run several dozen such surveys in different parts
p124
aVof the world, and in all cases except one,
p125
aVwhere a group actually underestimated
p126
aVthe trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency
p127
aVtowards overestimation, and so I thought it important
p128
aVto give a name to this, and that's what I refer to
p129
aVas globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars
p130
aVand the light gray bars.
p131
aa(lp132
VEspecially because, I suspect, some of you may still be
p133
aVa little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important
p134
aVto just spend a little bit of time thinking about
p135
aVwhy we might be prone to globaloney.
p136
aVA couple of different reasons come to mind.
p137
aVFirst of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
p138
aVLet me give you an example. When I first published
p139
aVsome of these data a few years ago
p140
aVin a magazine called Foreign Policy,
p141
aVone of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,
p142
aVwas Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled
p143
aV"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)
p144
aVWhat was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,
p145
aVwhich was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."
p146
aVAnd this caused me to scratch my head, because
p147
aVas I went back through his several-hundred-page book,
p148
aVI couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,
p149
aVreference or footnote.
p150
aVSo my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here
p151
aVto convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you
p152
aVto go away and look for your own data
p153
aVto try and actually assess whether some of these
p154
aVhand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with
p155
aVactually are correct.
p156
aVSo dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
p157
aa(lp158
VA second reason has to do with peer pressure.
p159
aVI remember, I decided to write my
p160
aV"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because
p161
aVI was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,
p162
aVand the interviewer's first question to me was,
p163
aV"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe
p164
aVthat the world is round?" And I started laughing,
p165
aVbecause I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)
p166
aVAnd as I was laughing, I was thinking,
p167
aVI really need a more coherent response, especially
p168
aVon national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)
p169
aVBut what I can't quite capture for you
p170
aVwas the pity and disbelief
p171
aVwith which the interviewer asked her question.
p172
aVThe perspective was, here is this poor professor.
p173
aVHe's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
p174
aVHe really has no idea
p175
aVas to what's actually going on in the world.
p176
aVSo try this out with your friends and acquaintances,
p177
aVif you like. You'll find that it's very cool
p178
aVto talk about the world being one, etc.
p179
aVIf you raise questions about that formulation,
p180
aVyou really are considered a bit of an antique.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then the final reason, which I mention,
p183
aVespecially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,
p184
aVhas to do with what I call "techno-trances."
p185
aVIf you listen to techno music for long periods of time,
p186
aVit does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)
p187
aVSomething similar seems to happen
p188
aVwith exaggerated conceptions of how technology
p189
aVis going to overpower in the very immediate run
p190
aVall cultural barriers, all political barriers,
p191
aVall geographic barriers, because at this point
p192
aVI know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,
p193
aVbut when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,
p194
aVhands go up, and people ask me,
p195
aV"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"
p196
aVAnd I got this question often enough that I thought
p197
aVI'd better do some research on Facebook.
p198
aVBecause, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology
p199
aVto think about. Theoretically, it makes it
p200
aVas easy to form friendships halfway around the world
p201
aVas opposed to right next door.
p202
aVWhat percentage of people's friends on Facebook
p203
aVare actually located in countries other than where
p204
aVpeople we're analyzing are based?
p205
aVThe answer is probably somewhere between
p206
aV10 to 15 percent.
p207
aVNon-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local
p208
aVor national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level
p209
aVthat you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
p210
aVWe don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random
p211
aVon Facebook. The technology is overlaid
p212
aVon a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,
p213
aVand those relationships are what the technology
p214
aVdoesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why
p215
aVwe get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends
p216
aVbeing located in countries other than where we are.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo does all this matter? Or is globaloney
p219
aVjust a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention
p220
aVto globalization-related issues?
p221
aVI want to suggest that actually,
p222
aVglobaloney can be very harmful to your health.
p223
aVFirst of all, recognizing that the glass
p224
aVis only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing
p225
aVthat there might be potential for additional gains
p226
aVfrom additional integration,
p227
aVwhereas if we thought we were already there,
p228
aVthere would be no particular point to pushing harder.
p229
aVIt's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference
p230
aVon radical openness if we already thought we were totally open
p231
aVto all the kinds of influences that are being talked about
p232
aVat this conference.
p233
aVSo being accurate about how limited globalization levels are
p234
aVis critical to even being able to notice
p235
aVthat there might be room for something more,
p236
aVsomething that would contribute further to global welfare.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhich brings me to my second point.
p239
aVAvoiding overstatement is also very helpful
p240
aVbecause it reduces and in some cases even reverses
p241
aVsome of the fears that people have about globalization.
p242
aVSo I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book
p243
aVworking through a litany of market failures and fears
p244
aVthat people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
p245
aVI'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,
p246
aVso let me just present to you two headlines
p247
aVas an illustration of what I have in mind.
p248
aVThink of France and the current debate about immigration.
p249
aVWhen you ask people in France what percentage
p250
aVof the French population is immigrants,
p251
aVthe answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
p252
aVMaybe realizing that the number is just eight percent
p253
aVmight help cool some of the superheated rhetoric
p254
aVthat we see around the immigration issue.
p255
aVOr to take an even more striking example,
p256
aVwhen the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
p257
aVdid a survey of Americans, asking them to guess
p258
aVwhat percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,
p259
aVthe guess was 30 percent, which is
p260
aVslightly in excess of the actual level \u2014 ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) \u2014
p261
aVof U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
p262
aVThe reassuring thing about this particular survey was,
p263
aVwhen it was pointed out to people how far
p264
aVtheir estimates were from the actual data,
p265
aVsome of them \u2014 not all of them \u2014 seemed to become
p266
aVmore willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo foreign aid is actually a great way
p269
aVof sort of wrapping up here, because
p270
aVif you think about it, what I've been talking about today
p271
aVis this notion \u2014 very uncontroversial amongst economists \u2014
p272
aVthat most things are very home-biased.
p273
aV"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"
p274
aVis about the most home-biased thing you can find.
p275
aVIf you look at the OECD countries and how much
p276
aVthey spend per domestic poor person,
p277
aVand compare it with how much they spend
p278
aVper poor person in poor countries,
p279
aVthe ratio \u2014 Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations \u2014
p280
aVturns out to be about 30,000 to one.
p281
aVNow of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,
p282
aVwould like to see that ratio being brought down
p283
aVto one-is-to-one.
p284
aVI'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim
p285
aVfor that to make substantial progress from where we are.
p286
aVIf we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,
p287
aVwe would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed
p288
aVat the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit
p289
aVthat ended last week made no further progress on.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo in summary, while radical openness is great,
p292
aVgiven how closed we are,
p293
aVeven incremental openness could make things
p294
aVdramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)
