VI first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
p4
aVI grew up in Mobile, Alabama \u2014
p5
aVsomebody's got to be from Mobile, right? \u2014
p6
aVand Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,
p7
aVforming this beautiful delta.
p8
aVAnd the delta has alligators crawling
p9
aVin and out of rivers filled with fish
p10
aVand cypress trees dripping with snakes,
p11
aVbirds of every flavor.
p12
aVIt's an absolute magical wonderland to live in \u2014
p13
aVif you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
p14
aVAnd this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I remember my first real contact with octopus
p17
aVwas probably at age five or six.
p18
aVI was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
p19
aVAnd I reached down and picked him up, and immediately
p20
aVbecame fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
p21
aVIt was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
p22
aVIt was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
p23
aVThen it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands
p24
aVand started flashing colors,
p25
aVjust pulsing all of these colors.
p26
aVAnd as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,
p27
aVraised into a spherical shape
p28
aVand turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
p29
aVI'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
p30
aVSo I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,
p31
aVso I put him down.
p32
aVThe octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:
p33
aVIt landed on the bottom in the rubble
p34
aVand \u2014 fwoosh! \u2014 vanished
p35
aVright before my eyes.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd I knew, right then, at age six,
p38
aVthat is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
p39
aVAnd I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,
p40
aVand then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school
p41
aVat the University of Hawaii.
p42
aVAnd while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
p43
aVAnd the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks
p44
aVbut not a lot of invertebrate displays,
p45
aVand being the spineless guy, I thought, well
p46
aVI'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals
p47
aVI had been learning about as a student
p48
aVand bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,
p51
aVbut they didn't really interact with people.
p52
aVBut the octopus did.
p53
aVIf you walked up to an octopus tank,
p54
aVespecially early in the morning before anyone arrived,
p55
aVthe octopus would rise up and look at you
p56
aVand you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"
p57
aVAnd you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize
p58
aVthat these animals all have different personalities:
p59
aVSome of them would hold their ground,
p60
aVothers would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,
p61
aVand one in particular, this amazing animal ...
p62
aVI went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,
p63
aVand he had little horns come up above his eyes.
p64
aVSo I went right up to the front of the tank \u2014
p65
aVI was three or four inches from the front glass \u2014
p66
aVand the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,
p67
aVand he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
p68
aVSo I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,
p69
aVand at that time I could actually focus that close;
p70
aVnow as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
p71
aVAnyway, there we were, staring at each other,
p72
aVand he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel
p73
aVand releases it in the jet of water entering the tank
p74
aVfrom the filtration system,
p75
aVand \u2014 chk chk chk chk chk! \u2014 this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
p76
aVHe reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it \u2014
p77
aVchk chk chk chk chk! \u2014 same thing.
p78
aVThen he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
p79
aVThen he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
p80
aVAnd then I realize the octopus won the arms race,
p81
aVbecause I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)
p82
aVBut the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day
p83
aVwas that this octopus was playing,
p84
aVwhich is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo, about three years into my degree,
p87
aVa funny thing happened on the way to the office,
p88
aVwhich actually changed the course of my life.
p89
aVA man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially
p90
aVhe sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific
p91
aVto collect animals for him,
p92
aVand as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
p93
aVHe said, "Make a movie about this expedition."
p94
aV"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie \u2014
p95
aVthis'll be interesting,"
p96
aVand off we went. And we did, we made a movie,
p97
aVwhich had to be the worst movie ever made
p98
aVin the history of movie making,
p99
aVbut it was a blast. I had so much fun.
p100
aVAnd I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,
p101
aVthinking, "Wait a minute.
p102
aVMaybe I can do this all the time.
p103
aVYeah, I'll be a filmmaker."
p104
aVSo I literally came back from that job,
p105
aVquit school, hung my filmmaking shingle
p106
aVand just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
p107
aVIt's been a good ride.
p108
aVAnd what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
p109
aVIf you're a wildlife filmmaker
p110
aVand you're going out into the field to film animals,
p111
aVespecially behavior,
p112
aVit helps to have a fundamental background
p113
aVon who these animals are,
p114
aVhow they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut where I really learned about octopus
p117
aVwas in the field, as a filmmaker
p118
aVmaking films with them,
p119
aVwhere you're allowed to spend large periods of time
p120
aVwith the animals, seeing octopus being octopus
p121
aVin their ocean homes.
p122
aVI remember I took a trip to Australia,
p123
aVwent to an island called One Tree Island.
p124
aVAnd apparently, evolution had occurred
p125
aVat a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,
p126
aVbetween the time they named it and the time I arrived,
p127
aVbecause I'm sure there were at least three trees
p128
aVon that island when we were there.
p129
aVAnyway, one tree is situated right next to
p130
aVa beautiful coral reef.
p131
aVIn fact, there's a surge channel
p132
aVwhere the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.
p133
aVAnd there's a beautiful reef,
p134
aVvery complex reef, with lots of animals,
p135
aVincluding a lot of octopus.
p136
aVAnd not uniquely
p137
aVbut certainly, the octopus in Australia
p138
aVare masters at camouflage.
p139
aVAs a matter of fact,
p140
aVthere's one right there.
p141
aVSo our first challenge was to find these things,
p142
aVand that was a challenge, indeed.
p143
aVBut the idea is, we were there for a month
p144
aVand I wanted to acclimate the animals to us
p145
aVso that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
p146
aVSo the first week was pretty much spent
p147
aVjust getting as close as we could,
p148
aVevery day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
p149
aVAnd you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy
p150
aVand you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
p151
aVAnd after the first week, they ignored us.
p152
aVIt was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
p153
aVSo they went on about their business
p154
aVand from a foot away, we're watching mating
p155
aVand courting and fighting
p156
aVand it is just an unbelievable experience.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd one of the most fantastic displays
p159
aVthat I remember, or at least visually,
p160
aVwas a foraging behavior.
p161
aVAnd they had a lot of different techniques
p162
aVthat they would use for foraging,
p163
aVbut this particular one used vision.
p164
aVAnd they would see a coral head,
p165
aVmaybe 10 feet away,
p166
aVand start moving over toward that coral head.
p167
aVAnd I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,
p168
aVbut whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom
p169
aVand go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,
p170
aVand then the web between the arms
p171
aVwould completely engulf the coral head,
p172
aVand they would fish out, swim for crabs.
p173
aVAnd as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
p174
aVAnd I always wondered what happened under that web.
p175
aVSo we created a way to find out, (Laughter)
p176
aVand I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
p177
aVIt was fantastic.
p178
aa(lp179
VIf you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,
p180
aVyou might as well pick one that's fairly common.
p181
aVAnd octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
p182
aVThey also live deep.
p183
aVAnd I can't say octopus are responsible
p184
aVfor my really strong interest
p185
aVin getting in subs and going deep,
p186
aVbut whatever the case, I like that.
p187
aVIt's like nothing you've ever done.
p188
aa(lp189
VIf you ever really want to get away from it all
p190
aVand see something that you have never seen,
p191
aVand have an excellent chance of seeing something
p192
aVno one has ever seen, get in a sub.
p193
aVYou climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,
p194
aVturn on the scrubber,
p195
aVwhich removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
p196
aVDown you go. There's no connection to the surface
p197
aVapart from a pretty funky radio.
p198
aVAnd as you go down, the washing machine
p199
aVat the surface calms down.
p200
aVAnd it gets quiet.
p201
aVAnd it starts getting really nice.
p202
aVAnd as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in
p203
aVgives way to darker and darker blue.
p204
aVAnd finally, it's a rich lavender,
p205
aVand after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
p206
aVAnd now you've entered the realm
p207
aVof the mid-water community.
p208
aa(lp209
VYou could give an entire talk
p210
aVabout the creatures that live in the mid-water.
p211
aVSuffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,
p212
aVwithout question, the most bizarre designs
p213
aVand outrageous behaviors
p214
aVare in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
p215
aVBut we're just going to zip right past this area,
p216
aVthis area that includes about 95 percent
p217
aVof the living space on our planet
p218
aVand go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,
p221
aV40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
p222
aVAnd they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,
p223
aVsome of which are tens of thousands of feet
p224
aVand bust through the surface,
p225
aVcreating islands like Hawaii.
p226
aVAnd the top of this mountain range
p227
aVis splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
p228
aVAnd when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is
p229
aVbecause literally thousands of active volcanoes
p230
aVare going off at any point in time
p231
aVall along this 40,000 mile range.
p232
aVAnd as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,
p233
aVmagma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
p234
aVand you're looking land \u2014 new land \u2014
p235
aVbeing created right before your eyes.
p236
aVAnd over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water
p237
aVcreating enormous pressure,
p238
aVforcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,
p239
aVuntil it hits a magma chamber
p240
aVwhere it becomes superheated
p241
aVand supersaturated with minerals,
p242
aVreverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface
p243
aVand is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
p244
aVIn fact, this whole area
p245
aVis like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
p248
aVThe surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
p249
aVSo it immediately cools,
p250
aVand it can no longer hold in suspension
p251
aVall of the material that it's dissolved,
p252
aVand it precipitates out, forming black smoke.
p253
aVAnd it forms these towers, these chimneys
p254
aVthat are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.
p255
aVAnd all along the sides of these chimneys
p256
aVis shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
p257
aVYou've got black smokers going all over the place
p258
aVand chimneys that have tube worms
p259
aVthat might be eight to 10 feet long.
p260
aVAnd out of the tops of these tube worms
p261
aVare these beautiful red plumes.
p262
aVAnd living amongst the tangle of tube worms
p263
aVis an entire community of animals:
p264
aVshrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,
p265
aVclams and swarms of arthropods
p266
aVthat are playing that dangerous game
p267
aVbetween over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd this whole ecosystem
p270
aVwasn't even known about
p271
aVuntil 33 years ago.
p272
aVAnd it completely threw science on its head.
p273
aVIt made scientists rethink
p274
aVwhere life on Earth might have actually begun.
p275
aVAnd before the discovery of these vents,
p276
aVall life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,
p277
aVwas believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.
p278
aVBut down there, there is no sun,
p279
aVthere is no photosynthesis;
p280
aVit's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,
p281
aVand it's all so ephemeral.
p282
aVYou might film this
p283
aVunbelievable hydrothermal vent,
p284
aVwhich you think at the time has to be on another planet.
p285
aVIt's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;
p286
aVit looks like aliens in an alien environment.
p287
aVBut you go back to the same vent eight years later
p288
aVand it can be completely dead.
p289
aVThere's no hot water.
p290
aVAll of the animals are gone, they're dead,
p291
aVand the chimneys are still there
p292
aVcreating a really nice ghost town,
p293
aVan eerie, spooky ghost town,
p294
aVbut essentially devoid of animals, of course.
p295
aVBut 10 miles down the ridge...
p296
aVpshhh! There's another volcano going.
p297
aVAnd there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
p298
aVAnd this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities
p299
aVis going on every 30 or 40 years
p300
aVall along the ridge.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd that ephemeral nature
p303
aVof the hydrothermal vent community
p304
aVisn't really different from some of the
p305
aVareas that I've seen
p306
aVin 35 years of traveling around, making films.
p307
aVWhere you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
p308
aVAnd you go back, and I'm at home,
p309
aVand I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...
p310
aVAh! I know where I can shoot that.
p311
aVThere's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."
p312
aVAnd you show up, and it's dead.
p313
aVThere's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
p314
aVYou think, "Well, what happened?"
p315
aVAnd you turn around,
p316
aVand there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,
p317
aVand bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
p318
aVAnd over here
p319
aVthere's a golf course going in.
p320
aVAnd this is the tropics.
p321
aVIt's raining like crazy here.
p322
aVSo this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,
p323
aVcarrying with it sediments from the construction site,
p324
aVsmothering the coral and killing it.
p325
aVAnd fertilizers and pesticides
p326
aVare flowing into the bay from the golf course \u2014
p327
aVthe pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,
p328
aVfertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom \u2014
p329
aVand there's your pea soup.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.
p332
aVI've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
p333
aVAnd I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"
p334
aVand go and work on the other side of the island.
p335
aVFive years later, come back,
p336
aVand that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
p337
aVIt's got living coral, fish all over the place,
p338
aVcrystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
p339
aVWell, how it happened is
p340
aVthe local community galvanized.
p341
aVThey recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;
p342
aVenacted laws and made permits required
p343
aVto do responsible construction
p344
aVand golf course maintenance
p345
aVand stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,
p346
aVand stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,
p347
aVand the bay recovered.
p348
aVThe ocean has an amazing ability
p349
aVto recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
p350
aa(lp351
VI think Margaret Mead
p352
aVsaid it best.
p353
aVShe said that a small group of thoughtful people
p354
aVcould change the world.
p355
aVIndeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
p356
aVAnd a small group of thoughtful people
p357
aVchanged that bay.
p358
aVI'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.
p359
aVI've been to a lot of lectures
p360
aVwhere, at the end of it, inevitably,
p361
aVone of the first questions that comes up is,
p362
aV"But, but what can I do?
p363
aVI'm an individual. I'm one person.
p364
aVAnd these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."
p365
aVFair enough question.
p366
aa(lp367
VMy answer to that is don't look
p368
aVat the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
p369
aVLook in your own backyard.
p370
aVLook in your heart, actually.
p371
aVWhat do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
p372
aVAnd fix it.
p373
aVCreate a healing zone in your neighborhood
p374
aVand encourage others to do the same.
p375
aVAnd maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,
p376
aVlittle dots on a map.
p377
aVAnd in fact, the way that we can communicate today \u2014
p378
aVwhere Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,
p379
aVand the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...
p380
aVand everybody is talking to everyone else \u2014
p381
aVit's not isolated points on a map anymore,
p382
aVit's a network we've created.
p383
aVAnd maybe these healing zones can start growing,
p384
aVand possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
p385
aVSo that's how I answer that question.
p386
aVLook in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
p387
aVWhat can you do that is more responsible
p388
aVthan what you're doing now?
p389
aVAnd do that, and spread the word.
p390
aVThe vent community animals
p391
aVcan't really do much
p392
aVabout the life and death
p393
aVthat's going on where they live, but up here we can.
p394
aVIn theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
p395
aVAnd we can make changes to our behavior
p396
aVthat will influence and affect the environment,
p397
aVlike those people changed the health of that bay.
p398
aa(lp399
VNow, Sylvia's TED Prize wish
p400
aVwas to beseech us to do anything we could,
p401
aVeverything we could,
p402
aVto set aside not pin pricks,
p403
aVbut significant expanses
p404
aVof the ocean for preservation,
p405
aV"hope spots," she calls them.
p406
aVAnd I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
p407
aVAnd it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"
p408
aVcan be in the deep ocean,
p409
aVan area that has historically
p410
aVbeen seriously neglected, if not abused.
p411
aVThe term "deep six" comes to mind:
p412
aV"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,
p413
aVdeep six it!"
p414
aVSo, I hope that we can also keep
p415
aVsome of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
p416
aVNow, I don't get a wish,
p417
aVbut I certainly can say
p418
aVthat I will do anything I can
p419
aVto support Sylvia Earle's wish.
p420
aVAnd that I do.
p421
aa(lp422
