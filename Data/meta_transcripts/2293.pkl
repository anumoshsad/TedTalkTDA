VAs a matter of fact,
p4
aVI was trying to think about my career since I left the White House,
p5
aVand the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.
p6
aVThis little boy is looking up at his father,
p7
aVand he says, "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president."
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VWell, I have had a great blessing as a former president,
p12
aVbecause I have had an access
p13
aVthat very few other people in the world have ever had
p14
aVto get to know so many people around this whole universe.
p15
aVNot only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States,
p16
aVbut also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world,
p17
aVand the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth.
p18
aVAnd a lot of times, when we go into a country,
p19
aVwe not only the meet the king or the president,
p20
aVbut we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo our overall commitment at the Carter Center
p23
aVis to promote human rights,
p24
aVand knowing the world as I do, I can tell you without any equivocation
p25
aVthat the number one abuse of human rights on Earth
p26
aVis, strangely, not addressed quite often, is the abuse of women and girls.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VThere are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with.
p31
aVFirst of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures, holy scriptures,
p32
aVin the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Quran and so forth,
p33
aVand these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions
p34
aVin the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques.
p35
aVAnd they interpret these rules to make sure that women
p36
aVare ordinarily relegated to a secondary position
p37
aVcompared to men in the eyes of God.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed.
p40
aVA number of years ago, in the year 2000,
p41
aVI had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years \u2014
p42
aVI tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday;
p43
aVI'll be teaching this Sunday as well \u2014
p44
aVbut the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided
p45
aVthat women should play a secondary position,
p46
aVa subservient position to men.
p47
aVSo they issued an edict, in effect,
p48
aVthat prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church,
p49
aVor chaplains in the military,
p50
aVand if a woman teaches a classroom
p51
aVin a Southern Baptist seminary,
p52
aVthey cannot teach if a boy is in the room,
p53
aVbecause you can find verses in the Bible,
p54
aVthere's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,
p55
aVthat say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth.
p56
aVBut the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted
p57
aVto keep men in an ascendant position.
p58
aVThat is an all-pervasive problem,
p59
aVbecause men can exert that power
p60
aVand if an abusive husband or an employer, for instance, wants to cheat women,
p61
aVthey can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God,
p62
aVwhy should I treat them as equals myself?
p63
aVWhy should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work?
p64
aa(lp65
VThe other very serious blight
p66
aVthat causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence,
p67
aVand that is increasing tremendously around the world.
p68
aVIn the United States of America, for instance, we have had
p69
aVan enormous increase in abuse of poor people,
p70
aVmostly black people and minorities, by putting them in prison.
p71
aVWhen I was in office as governor of Georgia,
p72
aVone out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison.
p73
aVNowadays, 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison.
p74
aVThat's a sevenfold increase.
p75
aVAnd since I left the White House,
p76
aVthere's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women
p77
aVwho are black who are in prison.
p78
aVWe also have [one of the only countries] on Earth
p79
aVthat still has the death penalty that is a developed country.
p80
aVAnd we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive
p81
aVin all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty.
p82
aVWe're in California now, and I figured out the other day
p83
aVthat California has spent four billion dollars
p84
aVin convicting 13 people for the death penalty.
p85
aVIf you add that up, that's 307 million dollars it costs California
p86
aVto send a person to be executed.
p87
aVNebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty,
p88
aVbecause it costs so much. (Applause)
p89
aVSo the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people
p90
aVis another cause of the increase in abuse of women.
p91
aa(lp92
VLet me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most,
p93
aVand I'll be fairly brief, because I have a limited amount of time, as you know.
p94
aa(lp95
VOne is genital mutilation.
p96
aVGenital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women,
p97
aVbut in some countries, many countries,
p98
aVwhen a child is born that's a girl, very soon in her life,
p99
aVher genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter
p100
aVwho has a razor blade and, in a non-sterilized way,
p101
aVthey remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia.
p102
aVAnd sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases,
p103
aVthey sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate.
p104
aVAnd then later, when she gets married, the same cutter goes in
p105
aVand opens the orifice up so she can have sex.
p106
aVThis is not a rare thing, although it's against the law in most countries.
p107
aVIn Egypt, for instance,
p108
aV91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today
p109
aVhave been sexually mutilated in that way.
p110
aVIn some countries, it's more than 98 percent
p111
aVof the women are cut that way before they reach maturity.
p112
aVThis is a horrible affliction
p113
aVon all women that live in those countries.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnother very serious thing is honor killings,
p116
aVwhere a family with misinterpretation, again, of a holy scripture \u2014
p117
aVthere's nothing in the Quran that mandates this \u2014
p118
aVwill execute a girl in their family
p119
aVif she is raped
p120
aVor if she marries a man that her father does not approve,
p121
aVor sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing.
p122
aVAnd this is done by members of her own family,
p123
aVso the family becomes murderers
p124
aVwhen the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family.
p125
aVAn analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations
p126
aVand it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl
p127
aVare perpetrated by the father, the uncle or the brother,
p128
aVbut 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnother problem that we have in the world
p131
aVthat relates to women particularly is slavery,
p132
aVor human trafficking it's called nowadays.
p133
aVThere were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery
p134
aVin the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century.
p135
aVThere are 30 million people now living in slavery.
p136
aVThe United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress
p137
aVto give a report every year,
p138
aVand the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold
p139
aVacross international borders every year into slavery,
p140
aVand that 80 percent of those sold are women,
p141
aVinto sexual slavery.
p142
aVIn the United States right this moment,
p143
aV60,000 people are living in human bondage, or slavery.
p144
aVAtlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is located
p145
aVand where I teach at Emory University,
p146
aVthey have between 200 and 300 women, people sold into slavery every month.
p147
aVIt's the number one place in the nation because of that.
p148
aVAtlanta has the busiest airport in the world,
p149
aVand they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere.
p150
aVIf a brothel owner
p151
aVwants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin,
p152
aVthey can do it for 1,000 dollars.
p153
aVA white-skinned girl brings several times more than that,
p154
aVand the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now
p155
aVcan earn about $35,000 per slave.
p156
aVThe sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.
p157
aVSo this is another very serious problem, and the basic problem is prostitution,
p158
aVbecause there's not a whorehouse in America
p159
aVthat's not known by the local officials,
p160
aVthe local policemen, or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd this leads to one of the worst problems,
p163
aVand that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery
p164
aVin all countries in the world.
p165
aa(lp166
VSweden has got a good approach to it.
p167
aVAbout 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law,
p168
aVand women are no longer prosecuted
p169
aVif they are in sexual slavery,
p170
aVbut the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted,
p171
aVand \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 prostitution has gone down.
p172
aVIn the United States, we take just the opposite position.
p173
aVFor every male arrested for illegal sex trade,
p174
aV25 women are arrested in the United States of America.
p175
aVCanada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,
p176
aVFrance, and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model.
p177
aVThat's another thing that can be done.
p178
aa(lp179
VWe have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire:
p180
aVour military and our great university system.
p181
aVIn the military, they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place.
p182
aVThe last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults
p183
aVthat took place in the military \u2014
p184
aV26,000.
p185
aVOnly 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted,
p186
aVand the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization \u2014
p187
aVa ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army
p188
aVor a company in the Marines \u2014
p189
aVthe commanding officer has the right under law to decide
p190
aVwhether to prosecute a rapist or not,
p191
aVand of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know
p192
aVthat under their command, sexual assaults are taking place,
p193
aVso they do not do it.
p194
aVThat law needs to be changed.
p195
aa(lp196
VAbout one out of four girls who enter American universities
p197
aVwill be sexually assaulted before she graduates,
p198
aVand this is now getting a lot of publicity,
p199
aVpartially because of my book, but other things,
p200
aVand so 89 universities in America are now condemned
p201
aVby the Department of Education under Title IX
p202
aVbecause the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women
p203
aVto protect them from sexual assault.
p204
aVThe Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes
p205
aVon a college campus take place by serial rapists,
p206
aVbecause outside of the university system,
p207
aVif they rape somebody, they'll be prosecuted,
p208
aVbut when they get on a university campus, they can rape with impunity.
p209
aVThey're not prosecuted.
p210
aVThose are the kinds of things that go on in our society.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnother thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls
p213
aVis the lack of equal pay for equal work,
p214
aVas you know. (Applause)
p215
aVAnd this is sometimes misinterpreted, but for full-time employment,
p216
aVa woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man.
p217
aVWhen I became president, the difference was 39 percent.
p218
aVSo we've made some progress, partially because I was president
p219
aVand so forth \u2014 (Applause) (Laughter) \u2014
p220
aVbut in the last 15 years, there's been no progress made,
p221
aVso it's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference
p222
aVfor the last 15 years.
p223
aVThese are the kind of things that go on.
p224
aVIf you take the Fortune 500 companies,
p225
aV23 of them have women CEOs,
p226
aVout of 500,
p227
aVand those CEOs, I need not tell you,
p228
aVmake less on an average
p229
aVthan the other CEOs.
p230
aVWell, that's what goes on in our country.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnother problem with the United States
p233
aVis we are the most warlike nation on Earth.
p234
aVWe have been to war with about 25 different countries
p235
aVsince the Second World War.
p236
aVSometimes, we've had soldiers on the ground fighting.
p237
aVThe other times, we've been flying overhead
p238
aVdropping bombs on people.
p239
aVOther times, of course, now, we have drones that attack people and so forth.
p240
aVWe've been at war with 25 different countries
p241
aVor more since the Second World War.
p242
aVThere was four years, I won't say which ones,
p243
aVwhere we didn't \u2014
p244
aV(Applause) \u2014 we didn't drop a bomb, we didn't launch a missile,
p245
aVwe didn't fire a bullet.
p246
aVBut anyway, those kinds of things, the resort to violence
p247
aVand the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures
p248
aVare what causes, are the basic causes, of abuse of women and girls.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere's one more basic cause that I need not mention,
p251
aVand that is that in general, men don't give a damn.
p252
aV(Applause) That's true.
p253
aVThe average man that might say, I'm against the abuse of women and girls
p254
aVquietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy,
p255
aVand this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child,
p256
aVwhen separate but equal had existed.
p257
aVRacial discrimination, legally, had existed for 100 years,
p258
aVfrom 1865 at the end of the War Between the States, the Civil War,
p259
aVall the way up to the 1960s,
p260
aVwhen Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed
p261
aVfor equal rights.
p262
aVBut during that time, there were many white people
p263
aVthat didn't think that racial discrimination was okay,
p264
aVbut they stayed quiet,
p265
aVbecause they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs,
p266
aVunique access to jury duty,
p267
aVbetter schools, and everything else,
p268
aVand that's the same thing that exists today,
p269
aVbecause the average man really doesn't care.
p270
aVEven though they say, "I'm against discrimination against girls and women,"
p271
aVthey enjoy a privileged position.
p272
aVAnd it's very difficult to get the majority of men
p273
aVwho control the university system,
p274
aVthe majority of men that control the military system,
p275
aVthe majority of men that control the governments of the world,
p276
aVand the majority of men that control the great religions.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo what is the basic thing that we need to do today?
p279
aVI would say the best thing that we could do today
p280
aVis for the women in the powerful nations
p281
aVlike this one, and where you come from,
p282
aVEurope and so forth, who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act,
p283
aVneed to take the responsibility on yourselves
p284
aVto be more forceful in demanding
p285
aVan end to racial discrimination against girls and women
p286
aVall over the world.
p287
aVThe average woman in Egypt
p288
aVdoesn't have much to say about her daughters
p289
aVgetting genitally mutilated and so forth.
p290
aVI didn't even go down to detail about that.
p291
aVBut I hope that out of this conference,
p292
aVthat every woman here  will get your husbands to realize
p293
aVthat these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth
p294
aVand in the future job market,
p295
aVneed to protect your daughters and your granddaughters.
p296
aa(lp297
VI have 12 grandchildren, four children, and 10 great-grandchildren,
p298
aVand I think often about them
p299
aVand about the plight that they will face in America,
p300
aVnot only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country,
p301
aVin having equal rights,
p302
aVand I hope that all of you will join me
p303
aVin being a champion for women and girls around the world
p304
aVand protect their human rights.
p305
aVThank you very much.
