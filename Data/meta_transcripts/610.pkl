VThere's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,
p4
aVdoesn't mean it's not there."
p5
aVMy work is \u2014 it's a reflection of myself.
p6
aVWhat I wanted to do is to
p7
aVshow the world that the little things
p8
aVcan be the biggest things.
p9
aVWe all seem to think that,
p10
aVyou know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.
p11
aVAnd we use the word "nothing."
p12
aVNothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.
p13
aVMy mother told me that, when I was a child,
p14
aVthat I should always respect the little things.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat made me do this work? I shall go into my story.
p17
aVThis all started when I was age five.
p18
aVWhat made me do it? At school, I will admit this:
p19
aVacademically, I couldn't express myself.
p20
aVSo I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."
p21
aVMy world was seen as less.
p22
aVSo I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.
p23
aVI thought, I need to retreat
p24
aVinto something else.
p25
aVSo when my mother used to take me to school,
p26
aVshe thought I was at school,
p27
aVand I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,
p28
aVand run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, the one time I was in the shed,
p31
aVand my mother suspected something,
p32
aVthinking I was at school.
p33
aVMy mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.
p34
aVSo you'd just see her feet.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVSo I was hiding in the shed, like that.
p37
aVAnd all of a sudden ...
p38
aVAnd then I saw her legs.
p39
aVAnd then she said \u2014 grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big \u2014
p40
aVand she lifted me up and she says,
p41
aV"How come you're not at school?"
p42
aVI told her I couldn't face it because the way
p43
aVthe teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,
p44
aVand using me as an example of failure.
p45
aVSo I told her.
p46
aVAt that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,
p47
aVbut I told her I didn't feel right.
p48
aVAnd then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
p49
aVAnd walked off. And I didn't expect that,
p50
aVbecause I expected one of these ...
p51
aVBut I didn't get it.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I'm sitting there thinking.
p54
aVAnd as I looked down on the ground,
p55
aVI noticed there was some ants running around.
p56
aVAnd I went into this little fantasy world.
p57
aVAnd I thought,
p58
aV"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?
p59
aVOr do they need somewhere to live?"
p60
aVSo I thought "Perhaps,
p61
aVif I made these ants some apartments,
p62
aVthey'll move in."
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVSo I did.
p65
aVAnd how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.
p66
aVAnd I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,
p67
aVconstructed this little apartment.
p68
aVWell it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
p69
aVBut I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.
p70
aVAnd so they did.
p71
aVThat was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments
p72
aVand little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.
p73
aVAnd then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.
p74
aVAnd then I sat down and all the ants came along.
p75
aVAnd all I could hear was "Is this for us?"
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I say, "Yes, they're all for you."
p80
aVAnd they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVAnd from there I was watching this little world.
p83
aVIt became part of me.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhen I discovered that I had this gift,
p86
aVI wanted to experiment with this world
p87
aVthat we can't see.
p88
aVSo I realized that there was more to life
p89
aVthan just everything that we see around us that's huge.
p90
aVSo I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
p91
aVAnd as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.
p92
aVMy mother told me to take it smaller.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow I shall show you something here.
p95
aVAnd I'll explain.
p96
aVAs you can see,
p97
aVthat's a pinhead.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
V(Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VNow that is called the Huf Haus.
p104
aVThe gentleman who commissioned me to do this
p105
aVwas a gentleman called Peter Huf.
p106
aVAnd he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd then he said to me,
p115
aV"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd I says, "Well, try me."
p118
aVAnd then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, to cut a long story short,
p121
aVI went home, went underneath the microscope,
p122
aVand I crushed up a piece of glass,
p123
aVcrushed it up.
p124
aVAnd underneath the microscope
p125
aVthere were splinters of glass.
p126
aVSome of them were quite jagged.
p127
aVSo I was crushing up these pieces of glass,
p128
aVwhich, as you can see,
p129
aVthat's the actual frame of the house.
p130
aVAnd the actual roof is made up of a fiber,
p131
aVwhich I found in my sister's old teddy bear.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVSo I got the teddy bear and I said,
p134
aV"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"
p135
aVSo I did.
p136
aVAnd I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.
p137
aVSo I decided to slice these up
p138
aVwith the tool that I make
p139
aVby \u2014 I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.
p140
aVAnd then I actually
p141
aVslow down my whole nervous system.
p142
aVAnd then I work between my heartbeat,
p143
aVI have one-and-a-half seconds
p144
aVto actually move.
p145
aVAnd at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale
p146
aVmy own work, at the same time.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aV(Applause)
p149
aVBecause that has happened to me.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VSo what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.
p154
aVI found these little bits of glass.
p155
aVAnd I had to make them square.
p156
aVSo I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
p157
aVSo what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.
p158
aVAnd what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.
p159
aVI used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.
p160
aVAnd I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.
p161
aVAnd then I started rubbing, very very gently,
p162
aVtill some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.
p163
aVAnd how I constructed it,
p164
aVis by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.
p165
aVAnd then pushing the glass in with its own friction.
p166
aVAnd as I was doing it, what happened?
p167
aVThe instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
p168
aVAnd it went like this ...
p169
aVAnd then that was it.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VGone.
p174
aVSo I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy
p175
aVwhen I told him his house has gone to another,
p176
aVinto the atmosphere somewhere."
p177
aVSo to cut the story short,
p178
aVI decided that I had to go back and do it.
p179
aVSo I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,
p180
aVconstruct it very, very slowly,
p181
aVholding my breath, working between my heartbeat,
p182
aVand making sure everything is leveled.
p183
aVBecause it's such a small sculpture,
p184
aVnothing can go wrong.
p185
aVAnd I decided to build it up.
p186
aVThen I used fibers out of my jumper,
p187
aVwhich I held and stretched.
p188
aVAnd made the beams going around the house.
p189
aVAnd the actual windows and the balcony
p190
aVhad to be sort of constructed.
p191
aVI used a money spider's web
p192
aVto actually attach certain things,
p193
aVwhich sent me insane.
p194
aVBut I managed to do it.
p195
aVAnd when I finished it, I came back the next day.
p196
aVI noticed that the house was occupied.
p197
aVHave we ever heard of a dust mite?
p198
aVDarren dust mite and his family moved in.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VSo basically I'd completed the house.
p203
aVAnd there you are.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VRight. As you can see,
p210
aVBart Simpson is having a little argument.
p211
aVI think they're arguing about the space on the pin.
p212
aVThere's not enough room for the two of them.
p213
aVSo I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
p214
aVI think he was just warning him actually.
p215
aVBut this one was made out of a nylon tag
p216
aVout of my shirt.
p217
aVWhat I did, I plucked the tag out
p218
aVand put it underneath the microscope.
p219
aVI used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
p220
aVCan anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?
p221
aa(lp222
VAudience: No.
p223
aa(lp224
VWW: So what I did is the same process where I
p225
aVjust kind of hold my breath
p226
aVand just work away very, very slowly,
p227
aVmanipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
p228
aVWhenever you work on that level, things behave different.
p229
aVBecause it's on this molecular level things change
p230
aVand they act different.
p231
aVAnd sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.
p232
aVAnd, you know, all different things happen.
p233
aVBut I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,
p234
aVto stop it moving.
p235
aVThen static electricity set in.
p236
aVAnd it went ...
p237
aVAnd I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.
p238
aVSo there is sweat dripping off my head,
p239
aVbecause I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.
p240
aVAnd after I've cut out the shape,
p241
aVthen I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo after I've done the same thing,
p244
aVthen I have to paint it.
p245
aVAnd after I've actually sculpted them,
p246
aVI have to paint them.
p247
aVI experimented with a \u2014
p248
aVI found a dead fly.
p249
aVAnd I plucked the hair off the fly's head.
p250
aVDecided to make a paintbrush.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVBut I would never do it to a living fly.
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aVBecause I've heard a fly in pain.
p255
aVAnd they go "Meow! Ow!"
p256
aVEven though they get on our nerves,
p257
aVI would never kill an insect
p258
aVbecause, "All creatures great and small" \u2014
p259
aVthere is a hymn that says that.
p260
aVSo what I decided to do
p261
aVis to pluck fine hair out of my face.
p262
aVAnd I looked at it underneath the microscope.
p263
aVThat was the paintbrush.
p264
aVAnd whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,
p265
aVbecause the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
p266
aVAnd it starts to dry very quickly.
p267
aVSo I have to be very quick.
p268
aVIf I'm not, it will end up looking
p269
aVnot like what it's supposed to look like.
p270
aVIt could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.
p271
aVSo I have to be very very careful.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis one took me approximately,
p274
aVI would say, six to seven weeks.
p275
aVMy work, rough estimate,
p276
aVsometimes five, six to seven weeks;
p277
aVyou can't always anticipate.
p278
aV(Applause)
p279
aVAs you can see,
p280
aVthat's Charlton Heston brought down to size.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVHe says to me, "Willard" \u2014
p283
aVYou can see him saying, "Why me?"
p284
aVI says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."
p285
aVAs you can see, there's an aphid fly there.
p286
aVThat's just to show the scale
p287
aVand the actual size of the sculpture.
p288
aVI would say it probably measures ...
p289
aVa quarter of a millimeter.
p290
aVIn America they say a period stop.
p291
aVSo say if you cut a period stop in half,
p292
aVa full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.
p293
aVIt's made \u2014 the chariot is made of gold.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,
p296
aVwhich I took out of the air.
p297
aVWhen the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.
p298
aVAnd what I normally do is walk 'round a room \u2014
p299
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p300
aVtrying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.
p301
aVI remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.
p302
aVAnd there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
p303
aVAnd she saw me walking around like this.
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVAnd then she looked at me.
p306
aVAnd then I went ...
p307
aVAnd then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."
p308
aVYeah, to actually do this thing \u2014
p309
aVthe actual chariot is made of gold.
p310
aVI had a 24-karat gold ring.
p311
aVAnd I cut off a little flake of gold.
p312
aVAnd I bent it 'round,
p313
aVand made it into the chariot.
p314
aVAnd the horse is made from nylon.
p315
aVAnd the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
p316
aVTo get the symmetrical shape of the horse
p317
aVwas very difficult,
p318
aVbecause I had to get the horse to rear up
p319
aVand look as though it was in some kind of action.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhen I did this one,
p322
aVa gentleman seen it and said to me,
p323
aV"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.
p324
aVThere's no way a man can do that.
p325
aVIt must be a machine."
p326
aVSo I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aV(Applause)
p329
aVThat one took me approximately six weeks.
p330
aV(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VThe most famous statue in the world.
p333
aVThis one, I would say,
p334
aVwas a serious challenge.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aVBecause I had to put the torch on the top.
p337
aVThat one is, more or less, the same type of process.
p338
aVThe bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,
p339
aVbecause I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.
p340
aVI used a microscopic shard of diamond
p341
aVto actually carve the actual base.
p342
aVWell, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,
p343
aVbecause that statue has always sort of
p344
aVkept an image in my head of, you know,
p345
aVthe beginning of people coming to America.
p346
aVSo it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.
p347
aVAnd that's the first thing they saw.
p348
aVSo I wanted to have that little image.
p349
aVAnd this is it.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd we all know that is the Hulk.
p353
aVI wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.
p354
aVBecause we know we see needles,
p355
aVbut people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle
p356
aVapart from putting a thread through it.
p357
aVSo I broke the needle.
p358
aVAnd made a needle look like
p359
aVthe Hulk's broken it.
p360
aVIt's \u2014 I had to make little holes
p361
aVin the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.
p362
aVSo most of my work, I don't use glue.
p363
aVThey go in with their own friction.
p364
aVAnd that's how I managed to do it.
p365
aVAs you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.
p366
aVAnd his mouth must be probably about
p367
aVthree microns.
p368
aVSo the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
p369
aa(lp370
VThat ship there,
p371
aVthat's made from 24-karat gold.
p372
aVAnd I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
p373
aVBut I had to rig it with strands of glue.
p374
aVBecause the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,
p375
aVbecause I couldn't get the web to move off.
p376
aVAnd that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.
p377
aVConstructed each plank of gold.
p378
aVAnd the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
p379
aVThe flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.
p380
aVIt's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
p381
aV(Applause)
p382
aa(lp383
VAs you can see, dressage.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVIt's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.
p386
aVThe actual rigging on the reins on the horse
p387
aVare made from the same sort of thing.
p388
aVAnd that was done with a particle from my shirt.
p389
aVAnd the pinhead I've made green around there
p390
aVby scraping the particles off a green shirt
p391
aVand then pressed onto the needle.
p392
aVIt's very painstaking work,
p393
aVbut the best things come in small packages.
