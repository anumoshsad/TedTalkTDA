VPat Mitchell: That day,
p4
aVJanuary 8, 2011, began like all others.
p5
aVYou were both doing the work that you love.
p6
aVYou were meeting with constituents,
p7
aVwhich is something that you loved doing
p8
aVas a congresswoman,
p9
aVand Mark, you were happily preparing
p10
aVfor your next space shuttle.
p11
aVAnd suddenly, everything  that you had planned
p12
aVor expected in your lives
p13
aVwas irrevocably changed forever.
p14
aa(lp15
VMark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,
p16
aVit's amazing how  everything can change
p17
aVfor any of us in an instant.
p18
aVPeople don't realize that.
p19
aVI certainly didn't.
p20
aVGabby Giffords: Yes.
p21
aVMK: And on that Saturday morning,
p22
aVI got this horrible phone call
p23
aVfrom Gabby's chief of staff.
p24
aVShe didn't have much other information.
p25
aVShe just said, "Gabby was shot."
p26
aVA few minutes later, I called her back
p27
aVand I actually thought for a second,
p28
aVwell, maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call.
p29
aVI called her back, and  that's when she told me
p30
aVthat Gabby had been shot in the head.
p31
aVAnd from that point on,
p32
aVI knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different.
p33
aa(lp34
VPM: And when you arrived at the hospital,
p35
aVwhat was the prognosis that they gave you
p36
aVabout Gabby's condition  and what recovery, if any,
p37
aVyou could expect?
p38
aa(lp39
VMK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head
p40
aVand a traumatic brain injury,
p41
aVthey typically can't tell you much.
p42
aVEvery injury is different. It's not predictable
p43
aVlike often a stroke might be predictable,
p44
aVwhich is another TBI kind of injury.
p45
aVSo they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma,
p46
aVdidn't know when that would change
p47
aVand what the prognosis would be.
p48
aa(lp49
VPM: Gabby, has your recovery
p50
aVbeen an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords
p51
aVor reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?
p52
aa(lp53
VGG: The new one \u2014 better, stronger, tougher.
p54
aV(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VMK: That to say,
p57
aVwhen you look at the picture behind us,
p58
aVto come back from that kind of injury
p59
aVand come back strong  and stronger than ever
p60
aVis a really tough thing to do.
p61
aVI don't know anybody
p62
aVthat's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here.
p63
aV(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VPM: And what were the first signs
p66
aVthat recovery was not  only going to be possible
p67
aVbut you were going to have some semblance
p68
aVof the life that you and Gabby had planned?
p69
aa(lp70
VMK: Well, the first thing, for me, was
p71
aVGabby was still kind of almost unconscious,
p72
aVbut she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed
p73
aVthat she used to do when we might
p74
aVbe out to dinner at a restaurant,
p75
aVin that she pulled my ring off
p76
aVand she flipped it from one finger to the next,
p77
aVand at that point I knew
p78
aVthat she was still in there.
p79
aVPM: And there were certain words, too.
p80
aVDidn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning?
p81
aa(lp82
VMK: Well, it was tough in the beginning. GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.
p83
aa(lp84
VMK: Yeah, that was it.
p85
aVFor the first month, that was the extent
p86
aVof Gabby's vocabulary.
p87
aVFor some reason, she has aphasia,
p88
aVwhich is difficulty with communication.
p89
aVShe latched on to the word "chicken,"
p90
aVwhich isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVAnd we were actually worried
p93
aVit could have been a lot worse than that.
p94
aVPM: Gabby, what's been  the toughest challenge
p95
aVfor you during this recovery?
p96
aa(lp97
VGG: Talking. Really hard. Really.
p98
aa(lp99
VMK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby knows what she wants to say,
p100
aVshe just can't get it out.
p101
aVShe understands everything,
p102
aVbut the communication is just very difficult
p103
aVbecause when you look at the picture,
p104
aVthe part of your brain where those communication centers are
p105
aVare on the left side of your head,
p106
aVwhich is where the bullet passed through.
p107
aa(lp108
VPM: So you have to do  a very dangerous thing:
p109
aVspeak for your wife.
p110
aa(lp111
VMK: I do.
p112
aVIt might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done.
p113
aa(lp114
VPM: Gabby, are you optimistic
p115
aVabout your continuing recovery \u2014
p116
aVwalking, talking,
p117
aVbeing able to move your arm and leg?
p118
aa(lp119
VGG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,
p120
aVbut I'm optimistic.
p121
aa(lp122
VPM: That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords,
p123
aVwouldn't you say? (Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VMK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.
p126
aVShe works incredibly hard every day.
p127
aa(lp128
VGG: On the treadmill,  walked on my treadmill,
p129
aVSpanish lessons, French horn.
p130
aa(lp131
VMK: It's only my wife who could be \u2014
p132
aVand if you knew her before she was injured,
p133
aVyou would kind of understand this \u2014
p134
aVsomebody who could be injured
p135
aVand have such a hard time communicating
p136
aVand meets with a speech therapist,
p137
aVand then about a month ago, she says,
p138
aV"I want to learn Spanish again."
p139
aa(lp140
VPM: Well, let's take a little closer look
p141
aVat the wife, and this was even before
p142
aVyou met Gabby Giffords.
p143
aVAnd she's on a motor scooter there,
p144
aVbut it's my understanding that's a very tame image
p145
aVof what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.
p146
aa(lp147
VMK: Yeah, Gabby, she  used to race motorcycles.
p148
aVSo that's a scooter, but she had \u2014
p149
aVwell, she still has a BMW motorcycle.
p150
aa(lp151
VPM: Does she ride it? MK: Well, that's a challenge
p152
aVwith not being able to move her right arm,
p153
aVbut I think with something I know about, Velcro,
p154
aVwe might be able to get her back on the bike,
p155
aVVelcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.
p156
aa(lp157
VPM: I have a feeling we might  see that picture next,
p158
aVGabby.
p159
aVBut you meet, you're already decided
p160
aVthat you're going to dedicate  your life to service.
p161
aVYou're going into the military
p162
aVand eventually to become an astronaut.
p163
aVSo you meet.
p164
aVWhat attracts you to Gabby?
p165
aa(lp166
VMK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,
p167
aVit was the last time we were in Vancouver,
p168
aVabout 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,
p169
aVat the airport, on a trip  that we were both taking
p170
aVto China,
p171
aVthat I would actually, from my background,
p172
aVI would call it a boondoggle.
p173
aVGabby would \u2014 GG: Fact-finding mission.
p174
aa(lp175
VMK: She would call it an important fact-finding mission.
p176
aVShe was a state senator at the time,
p177
aVand we met here, at the airport,
p178
aVbefore a trip to China.
p179
aa(lp180
VPM: Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance?
p181
aa(lp182
VGG: No, no, no.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVA good friend.
p185
aa(lp186
VMK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.
p187
aa(lp188
VGG: Yes. (Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VMK: And then she invited me on, about a year or so later,
p191
aVshe invited me on a date.
p192
aVWhere'd we go, Gabby?
p193
aa(lp194
VGG: Death row.
p195
aa(lp196
VMK: Yes. Our first date was to death row
p197
aVat the Florence state prison in Arizona,
p198
aVwhich was just outside  Gabby's state senate district.
p199
aVThey were working on some legislation
p200
aVthat had to do with crime and punishment
p201
aVand capital punishment  in the state of Arizona.
p202
aVSo she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her,
p203
aVand I'm like, "Of course I  want to go to death row."
p204
aVSo that was our first date.
p205
aVWe've been together ever since. GG: Yes.
p206
aa(lp207
VPM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason
p208
aVthat Gabby decided to marry you.
p209
aVYou were willing to go to death row, after all.
p210
aa(lp211
VMK: I guess.
p212
aa(lp213
VPM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?
p214
aa(lp215
VGG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.
p216
aa(lp217
VMK: I thought we always
p218
aVhad a very special relationship.
p219
aVWe've gone through some tough times
p220
aVand it's only made it stronger. GG: Stronger.
p221
aa(lp222
VPM: After you got married, however,
p223
aVyou continued very independent lives.
p224
aVActually, you didn't even live together.
p225
aa(lp226
VMK: We had one of those commuter marriages.
p227
aVIn our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,
p228
aVTucson.
p229
aVSometimes we'd go clockwise,
p230
aVsometimes counterclockwise,
p231
aVto all those different places,
p232
aVand we didn't really live together
p233
aVuntil that Saturday morning.
p234
aVWithin an hour of Gabby being shot,
p235
aVI was on an airplane to Tucson,
p236
aVand that was the moment
p237
aVwhere that had changed things.
p238
aa(lp239
VPM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress
p240
aVafter being a state senator
p241
aVand served in Congress for six years.
p242
aVWhat did you like best
p243
aVabout being in Congress?
p244
aa(lp245
VGG: Fast pace. Fast pace.
p246
aa(lp247
VPM: Well it was the way you did it. GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace.
p248
aa(lp249
VPM: I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VMK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often
p253
aVat a colossally slow pace,
p254
aVbut my wife, and I have to admit,
p255
aVa lot of other members of Congress that I know,
p256
aVwork incredibly hard.
p257
aVI mean, Gabby would run  around like a crazy person,
p258
aVnever take a day off,
p259
aVmaybe a half a day off a month,
p260
aVand whenever she was awake she was working,
p261
aVand she really, really thrived on that,
p262
aVand still does today. GG: Yes. Yes.
p263
aa(lp264
VPM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,
p265
aVI have to say.
p266
aVSo after the tragic incident, Mark,
p267
aVyou decided to resign
p268
aVyour position as an astronaut,
p269
aVeven though you were supposed to take
p270
aVthe next space mission.
p271
aVEverybody, including Gabby,
p272
aVtalked you into going back,
p273
aVand you did end up taking.
p274
aa(lp275
VMK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,
p276
aVI called my boss, the chief astronaut,
p277
aVDr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,
p278
aV"Peggy, I know I'm launching in space
p279
aVin three months from now.
p280
aVGabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.
p281
aVYou've got to find a replacement for me."
p282
aVSo I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,
p283
aVbut I gave up my job and they found a replacement.
p284
aVMonths later, maybe about two months later,
p285
aVI started about getting my job back,
p286
aVwhich is something,
p287
aVwhen you become this primary caregiver person,
p288
aVwhich some people in the audience here
p289
aVhave certainly been in that position,
p290
aVit's a challenging role but at some point
p291
aVyou've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back,
p292
aVand at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby
p293
aVif she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.
p294
aVBut I knew she was\u2014 GG: Yes. Yes. Yes.
p295
aa(lp296
VMK: She was the biggest  supporter of my career,
p297
aVand I knew it was the right thing to do.
p298
aa(lp299
VPM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,
p300
aVwhat that was like, going off onto a mission,
p301
aVone presumes safely,  but it's never a guarantee,
p302
aVand knowing that Gabby is \u2014
p303
aa(lp304
VMK: Well not only was  she still in the hospital,
p305
aVon the third day of that flight,
p306
aVliterally while I was
p307
aVrendezvousing with the space station,
p308
aVand you've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour,
p309
aVI'm actually flying it, looking out the window,
p310
aVa bunch of computers,
p311
aVGabby was in brain surgery,
p312
aVliterally at that time having the final surgery
p313
aVto replace the piece of skull
p314
aVthat they took out on the day she was injured
p315
aVwith a prosthetic, yeah, which is the whole side of her head.
p316
aVNow if any of you guys would ever come
p317
aVto our house in Tucson for the first time,
p318
aVGabby would usually go up to the freezer
p319
aVand pull out the piece of Tupperware
p320
aVthat has the real skull. (Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VGG: The real skull. MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.
p323
aa(lp324
VPM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?
p325
aa(lp326
VMK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.
p327
aa(lp328
VPM: But there was a lot  of conversation about
p329
aVsomething you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.
p330
aVYou had to make another  step of courage too,
p331
aVbecause here was  Congress deadlocked again,
p332
aVand you got out of the rehabilitation center,
p333
aVgot yourself to Washington
p334
aVso that you could walk  on the floor of the House \u2014
p335
aVI can barely talk about this without getting emotional \u2014
p336
aVand cast a vote which could have been
p337
aVthe deciding vote.
p338
aa(lp339
VGG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.
p340
aa(lp341
VMK: Yeah, we had that vote,
p342
aVI guess about five months after Gabby was injured,
p343
aVand she made this bold decision to go back.
p344
aVA very controversial vote,
p345
aVbut she wanted to be there
p346
aVto have her voice heard one more time.
p347
aa(lp348
VPM: And after that, resigned
p349
aVand began what has been a very slow
p350
aVand challenging recovery.
p351
aVWhat's life like, day to day?
p352
aa(lp353
VMK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.
p354
aa(lp355
VGG: Nelson.
p356
aa(lp357
VMK: New member of our family. GG: Yes, yes.
p358
aa(lp359
VMK: And we got him from a\u2014
p360
aa(lp361
VGG: Prison. Murder. MK: We have a lot of connections
p362
aVwith prisons, apparently. (Laughter)
p363
aVNelson came from a prison,
p364
aVraised by a murderer in Massachusetts.
p365
aVBut she did a great job with this dog.
p366
aVHe's a fabulous service dog.
p367
aa(lp368
VPM: So Gabby, what have you learned
p369
aVfrom your experiences the past few years?
p370
aa(lp371
VMK: Yeah, what have you learned? GG: Deeper. Deeper.
p372
aa(lp373
VPM: Your relationship is deeper.
p374
aVIt has to be. You're together all the time now.
p375
aa(lp376
VMK: I imagine being grateful, too, right?
p377
aa(lp378
VGG: Grateful.
p379
aa(lp380
VPM: This is a picture of  family and friends gathering,
p381
aVbut I love these pictures because they show
p382
aVthe Gabby and Mark relationship now.
p383
aVAnd you describe it, Gabby, over and over,
p384
aVas deeper on so many levels. Yes?
p385
aa(lp386
VMK: I think when something tragic happens
p387
aVin a family, it can pull people together.
p388
aVHere's us watching the space shuttle
p389
aVfly over Tucson,
p390
aVthe Space Shuttle Endeavour,
p391
aVthe one that I was the  commander on its last flight,
p392
aVon its final flight on top of an airplane
p393
aVon a 747 on its way to L.A.,
p394
aVNASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson.
p395
aa(lp396
VPM: And of course, the two of you
p397
aVgo through these challenges
p398
aVof a slow and difficult recovery,
p399
aVand yet, Gabby, how do you maintain
p400
aVyour optimism and positive outlook?
p401
aa(lp402
VGG: I want to make the world a better place.
p403
aV(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VPM: And you're doing that
p406
aVeven though your recovery has to remain
p407
aVfront and center for both of you.
p408
aVYou are people who have done service
p409
aVto your country and you  are continuing to do that
p410
aVwith a new initiative, a new purpose.
p411
aVAnd Gabby, what's on the agenda now?
p412
aa(lp413
VGG: Americans for Responsible Solutions.
p414
aa(lp415
VMK: That's our political action committee,
p416
aVwhere we are trying to  get members of Congress
p417
aVto take a more serious look at gun violence in this country,
p418
aVand to try to
p419
aVpass some reasonable legislation.
p420
aa(lp421
VGG: Yes. Yes. (Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VMK: You know, this affected  us very personally,
p424
aVbut it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved.
p425
aVIt was really the 20 murdered first graders
p426
aVand kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,
p427
aVand the response that we saw afterwards
p428
aVwhere \u2014 well, look what's happened so far.
p429
aVSo far the national response has been
p430
aVpretty much to do nothing.
p431
aVWe're trying to change that.
p432
aa(lp433
VPM: There have been 11 mass shootings
p434
aVsince Newtown,
p435
aVa school a week in the first  two months of last year.
p436
aVWhat are you doing that's different
p437
aVthan other efforts to balance
p438
aVrights for gun ownership and responsibilities?
p439
aa(lp440
VMK: We're gun owners,  we support gun rights.
p441
aVAt the same time, we've  got to do everything we can
p442
aVto keep guns out of the hands of criminals
p443
aVand the dangerously mentally ill.
p444
aVIt's not too difficult to do that.
p445
aVThis issue, like many others,
p446
aVhas become very polarizing and political,
p447
aVand we're trying to bring some balance
p448
aVto the debate in Washington.
p449
aa(lp450
VPM: Thank you both for that effort.
p451
aVAnd not surprisingly for  this woman of courage
p452
aVand of a sense of adventure,
p453
aVyou just keep challenging yourself,
p454
aVand the sky seems to be the limit.
p455
aVI have to share this video
p456
aVof your most recent adventure.
p457
aVTake a look at Gabby.
p458
aa(lp459
VMK: This is a couple months ago.
p460
aa(lp461
V(Video) MK: You okay? You did great. GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.
p462
aVGood stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you.
p463
aVMountains. Gorgeous mountains.
p464
aV(Applause)
p465
aa(lp466
VMK: Let me just say
p467
aVone of the guys that Gabby jumped with
p468
aVthat day was a Navy SEAL
p469
aVwho she met in Afghanistan
p470
aVwho was injured in combat,
p471
aVhad a really rough time.
p472
aVGabby visited him
p473
aVwhen he was at Bethesda
p474
aVand went through a really tough period.
p475
aVHe started doing better.
p476
aVMonths later, Gabby was shot in the head,
p477
aVand then he supported her
p478
aVwhile she was in the hospital in Houston.
p479
aVSo they have a very, very nice connection.
p480
aa(lp481
VGG: Yes.
p482
aa(lp483
VPM: What a wonderful moment.
p484
aVBecause this is the TED stage,
p485
aVGabby, I know you worked very hard
p486
aVto think of the ideas that you wanted to leave
p487
aVwith this audience.
p488
aa(lp489
VGG: Thank you.
p490
aVHello, everyone.
p491
aVThank you for inviting us here today.
p492
aVIt's been a long, hard haul,
p493
aVbut I'm getting better.
p494
aVI'm working hard,
p495
