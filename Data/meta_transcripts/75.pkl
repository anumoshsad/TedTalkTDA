VVideo: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view
p4
aVgives one impression.
p5
aVSeen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
p6
aVBut it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
p7
aVwhat's going on.
p8
aa(lp9
VSasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
p10
aVAnd I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about
p11
aVthe power of, and importance of, independent media
p12
aVthan I could say in an hour.
p13
aVSo I thought that it will be good to start with it.
p14
aVAnd also start with a little bit of statistics.
p15
aVAccording to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet
p16
aVlives in the societies without independent press.
p17
aVThink about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet
p18
aVdoes not really know what is going on in their countries.
p19
aVThe information they get gets filtered through somebody
p20
aVwho either twists that information, or colors that information,
p21
aVdoes something with it.
p22
aVSo they're deprived of understanding their reality.
p23
aVThat is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
p24
aVNow those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies
p25
aVthat represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
p26
aVYou know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
p27
aVEnjoy it while it lasts.
p28
aVBecause as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,
p29
aVbut they can also lose press freedom,
p30
aVas I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
p31
aVBut that's totally another and separate topic.
p32
aVSo I can go back to my story.
p33
aa(lp34
VMy story starts \u2014 the story I want to share \u2014 starts in 1991.
p35
aVAt that time I was running B92, the only independent,
p36
aVfor that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
p37
aVAnd I guess we were sharing \u2014 we had that regular life of the only
p38
aVindependent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,
p39
aVwhere government really wants to make your life miserable.
p40
aVAnd there are different ways.
p41
aVYeah, it was the usual cocktail:
p42
aVa little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,
p43
aVa little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,
p44
aVso you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
p45
aVBut what they really do, which is very powerful,
p46
aVand that is what governments in the late '90s started doing
p47
aVif they don't like independent media companies \u2014
p48
aVyou know, they threaten your advertisers.
p49
aVOnce they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,
p50
aVyou know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come \u2014
p51
aVno matter how much does it make sense for them \u2014
p52
aVdo not want to come and advertise.
p53
aVAnd you have a problem making ends meet.
p54
aa(lp55
VAt that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,
p56
aVwhich was, you know, survival below one side,
p57
aVbut what was really painful for me was,
p58
aVremember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
p59
aVWe were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,
p60
aVin a slow-motion downfall.
p61
aVAnd we all had all of that on tapes.
p62
aVWe had the ability to understand what was going on.
p63
aVWe were actually recording history.
p64
aVThe problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;
p65
aVbecause if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes
p66
aVto keep archives of that history.
p67
aVSo if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
p68
aVIn that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
p69
aVIt was still 1991.
p70
aVHe was running a media systems organization
p71
aVwhich is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
p72
aVAnd what did I know at that time about media systems?
p73
aVI would think media systems were organizations,
p74
aVwhich means they should help you.
p75
aVSo I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:
p76
aVthe small one and the big one.
p77
aVThe small one was, I just wanted him
p78
aVto help us get those damn tapes,
p79
aVso we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
p80
aVThe big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
p81
aVBecause I thought, I still maintain,
p82
aVthat serious and independent media companies are great business.
p83
aVAnd I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company
p84
aVonce Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
p85
aVIt's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest
p86
aVmedia company in the country.
p87
aVAnd I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time
p88
aVwas 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
p89
aa(lp90
VTo make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,
p91
aVgreat suit and tie.
p92
aVI gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation
p93
aVof the political situation and explained how hard and difficult
p94
aVthe war will be.
p95
aVActually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
p96
aVAnyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,
p97
aVthe only question he had for me \u2014 and this is not a joke \u2014
p98
aVis, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music
p99
aVof Michael Jackson?
p100
aVThat was really the only question he had.
p101
aVHe left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself
p102
aVbecause I thought there must be an institution in the world
p103
aVthat is providing loans to media companies.
p104
aVIt's so obvious, straight in your face,
p105
aVand somebody must have thought of it.
p106
aVSomebody must have started something like that.
p107
aVAnd I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
p108
aVYou know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;
p109
aVyou could not just Google in '91.
p110
aVSo I thought that that's actually my problem.
p111
aVNow we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
p112
aa(lp113
VI have \u2014 I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,
p114
aVtrying for the third time to convince him that
p115
aVhis foundation should invest in something that should
p116
aVoperate like a media bank.
p117
aVAnd basically what I was saying is very simple.
p118
aVYou know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
p119
aVForget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
p120
aVWhat you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
p121
aVIt's business anywhere.
p122
aVMedia business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
p123
aVAnd what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
p124
aVSo third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
p125
aVAt the end of the meeting he says,
p126
aVlook, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;
p127
aVbut my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
p128
aVSee that it will not work.
p129
aVHe said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVI knew two things after that meeting.
p132
aVFirst, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
p133
aVAnd second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
p134
aVYou see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
p135
aVBut it's one thing to have a concept;
p136
aVit's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
p139
aVHad the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
p140
aVYou see banks \u2014 I don't know if there are any bankers over here;
p141
aVI apologize in advance \u2014 but it's the best job in the world.
p142
aVYou know, you find somebody who is respectable
p143
aVand has a lot of money.
p144
aVYou give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
p145
aVYou collect interest and do nothing in between.
p146
aVSo I thought, why don't we get into that business?
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVSo here we are having our first client, brilliant.
p149
aVFirst independent newspaper in Slovakia.
p150
aVThe government cutting them off
p151
aVfrom all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
p152
aVSo here's the daily newspaper
p153
aVthat has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
p154
aVIt's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
p155
aVThat means that they have no sports;
p156
aVthey have no latest news; circulation goes down.
p157
aVIt's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way
p158
aVhow to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
p159
aVThey come to us with a request for a loan.
p160
aVThey want to \u2014 the only way for them to survive
p161
aVis to get a printing press.
p162
aVAnd we said, that's fine; let's meet;
p163
aVyou'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe start the meeting.
p166
aVI get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,
p167
aVso it's much bigger.
p168
aVA lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
p169
aVBut however you put it, you know, the numbers
p170
aVdo not make any sense.
p171
aVAnd that's the best they could do.
p172
aVWe were the best that they could do.
p173
aVSo that is how we understood what our method is.
p174
aVIt's not a bank. We had to actually
p175
aVgo into these companies and earn our return
p176
aVby fixing them \u2014 by establishing management systems,
p177
aVby providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business
p178
aVon one side \u2014 while they all know how to run, how to create content.
p179
aa(lp180
VJust quickly on the results.
p181
aVOver these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,
p182
aVaverage interest rate five percent to six percent.
p183
aVLately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
p184
aVWe do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
p185
aVAnd here is the most stunning number.
p186
aVReturn rate \u2014 the one that Soros was so worried about \u2014 97 percent.
p187
aV97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.
p188
aVWhat do we typically finance?
p189
aVWe finance anything that a media company would need,
p190
aVfrom printing presses to transmitters.
p191
aVWhat is most important is we do it
p192
aVeither in form of loans, equities, lease \u2014
p193
aVwhatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
p194
aVBut what is most important here is, who do we finance?
p195
aVWe believe that in the last 10 years companies
p196
aVthat we've financed are actually the best media companies
p197
aVin the developing world.
p198
aVThat is a "Who is Who" list.
p199
aVAnd I could spend hours talking about them,
p200
aVbecause they're all kind of heroes.
p201
aVAnd I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,
p202
aVand depending on time I may give you two examples
p203
aVwho we work with.
p204
aa(lp205
VYou see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,
p206
aVand moved to Russia.
p207
aVOur first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
p208
aVI'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
p209
aVIn the south of Russia there's a guy called
p210
aVBoris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running
p211
aVan independent newspaper there.
p212
aVThe city was closed until early '90s
p213
aVbecause, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
p214
aVAnyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
p215
aVAfter two years working with us, he becomes
p216
aVthe most respected newspaper in that small place.
p217
aVGovernor comes to him one day,
p218
aVactually invites him to come to his office.
p219
aVHe goes and sees the governor. The governor says,
p220
aVBoris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,
p221
aVand you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
p222
aVAnd I want to offer you a deal.
p223
aVCan you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,
p224
aVbecause I have elections \u2014
p225
aVthere are elections coming up in nine months.
p226
aVI will not run, but it's very important for me
p227
aVwho is going to succeed me.
p228
aVSo give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
p229
aVI have no interest in being in media business.
p230
aVHow much would that cost?
p231
aVBoris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
p232
aVThe governor says, "We will close you."
p233
aVBoris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."
p234
aVSix months later the newspaper was closed.
p235
aVLuckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich
p236
aVtake all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,
p237
aVto get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
p238
aVSo what the governor got was an empty shell.
p239
aVBut that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,
p240
aVand if you are a banker for independent media.
p241
aVSo it sounds like a great story.
p242
aa(lp243
VSomewhere down the road we opened a media management center.
p244
aVWe started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
p245
aVBut there is a second angle to that.
p246
aVThe second angle, like in this clip.
p247
aVIf you take the camera above, you start thinking
p248
aVabout these numbers again.
p249
aV40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.
p250
aVThat is not too much, is it?
p251
aVIt's actually just a drop in the sea.
p252
aVBecause when you think about the importance,
p253
aVsome of the issues that we were talking about last night \u2014
p254
aVthis last session we had about Africa and his
p255
aVhypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
p256
aVAll of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night \u2014
p257
aVgovernment accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,
p258
aVgiving voice to unheard, to poor \u2014
p259
aVit's why independent media is in business.
p260
aVAnd it's why it was invented.
p261
aVSo from that perspective, what we did is just really
p262
aVone drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
p263
aVNow ours is just one story.
p264
aa(lp265
VI'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories
p266
aVof nonprofits doing spectacular work.
p267
aVHere is where the problem is,
p268
aVand I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
p269
aVAnd it's called fundraising.
p270
aVImagine that this third of this room is filled
p271
aVwith people who represent different foundations.
p272
aVImagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,
p273
aVdoing very important work.
p274
aVNow imagine that every second person over here
p275
aVis deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
p276
aVNow that is how difficult it is to match people
p277
aVfrom this side of the room
p278
aVwith people of that side of the room.
p279
aVSo we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed
p280
aVto reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
p281
aVYou know, instead of people running in this dark,
p282
aVtrying to find their own match, who will be willing,
p283
aVwho has the same goals.
p284
aVInstead of all of that we thought there is \u2014
p285
aVsomething new needs to be invented.
p286
aVAnd we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,
p287
aVpress freedom bonds.
p288
aVIf there are investors willing to finance
p289
aVU.S. government budget deficit,
p290
aVwhy wouldn't we find investors willing to finance
p291
aVpress freedom deficit?
p292
aVWe've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,
p293
aVprobably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.
p294
aVI don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
p295
aVBut the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,
p296
aVfind enough investors that this can be considered a success,
p297
aVthere's nothing stopping the next organization
p298
aVto start to issue bonds next spring.
p299
aVAnd those can be environmental bonds.
p300
aVAnd then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his
p301
aVelectricity in Bangladesh bonds.
p302
aVAnd before you know it, any social cause
p303
aVcan be actually financed in this way.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
p306
aVBut let's take the idea further.
p307
aVYou do it, you start it in the States, because it's,
p308
aVyou know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
p309
aVBut you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
p310
aVYou can bring it to Asia.
p311
aVYou can, once you have all of those different points,
p312
aVyou can make it easy for investors.
p313
aVPut all of those bonds at one place
p314
aVand they sit down and click.
p315
aVOnce you have more than 10 of them
p316
aVyou have to develop some kind of a matrix.
p317
aVWhat do investors get?
p318
aVOn one side financial, on the other side social.
p319
aVSo that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,
p320
aVMorningstar type.
p321
aVIt says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
p322
aVFinancial, they give you one percent, only one star.
p323
aVNow take it to the last step.
p324
aVOnce you have all of that put together,
p325
aVthere's not one reason why you couldn't actually have
p326
aVa marketplace for all of that,
p327
aVwhere you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
p328
aVAnd in that way you organize the financing
p329
aVso there are no dark rooms, no blind people
p330
aVrunning around to find each other.
p331
