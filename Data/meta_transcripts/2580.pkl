VI'm a journalist,
p4
aVso I like to look for the untold stories,
p5
aVthe lives that quietly play out under the scream of headlines.
p6
aVI've also been going about the business of putting down roots,
p7
aVchoosing a partner, making babies.
p8
aVSo for the last few years,
p9
aVI've been trying to understand
p10
aVwhat constitutes the 21st-century good life,
p11
aVboth because I'm fascinated by the moral and philosophical implications,
p12
aVbut also because I'm in desperate need of answers myself.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe live in tenuous times.
p15
aVIn fact, for the first time in American history,
p16
aVthe majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off
p17
aVthan they were.
p18
aVThis is true of rich and poor, men and women.
p19
aVNow, some of you might hear this and feel sad.
p20
aVAfter all, America is deeply invested
p21
aVin this idea of economic transcendence,
p22
aVthat every generation kind of leapfrogs the one before it,
p23
aVearning more, buying more, being more.
p24
aVWe've exported this dream all over the world,
p25
aVso kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya
p26
aVinherit our insatiable expectation
p27
aVfor more.
p28
aVBut when I read this historic poll for the first time,
p29
aVit didn't actually make me feel sad.
p30
aVIt felt like a provocation.
p31
aV"Better off" \u2014 based on whose standards?
p32
aa(lp33
VIs "better off" finding a secure job
p34
aVthat you can count on for the rest of your life?
p35
aVThose are nearly extinct.
p36
aVPeople move jobs, on average, every 4.7 years,
p37
aVand it's estimated that by 2020,
p38
aVnearly half of Americans will be freelancers.
p39
aVOK, so is better off just a number?
p40
aVIs it about earning as much as you possibly can?
p41
aVBy that singular measurement, we are failing.
p42
aVMedian per capita income has been flat since about 2000,
p43
aVadjusted for inflation.
p44
aVAll right, so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence?
p45
aVLess of us are doing that.
p46
aVNearly five million people lost their homes in the Great Recession,
p47
aVand even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go \u2014
p48
aVor be tricked into going, in many predatory cases \u2014
p49
aVto hold that deed.
p50
aVHome-ownership rates are at their lowest since 1995.
p51
aa(lp52
VAll right, so we're not finding steady employment,
p53
aVwe're not earning as much money,
p54
aVand we're not living in big fancy houses.
p55
aVToll the funeral bells
p56
aVfor everything that made America great.
p57
aVBut,
p58
aVare those the best measurements of a country's greatness,
p59
aVof a life well lived?
p60
aVWhat I think makes America great is its spirit of reinvention.
p61
aVIn the wake of the Great Recession,
p62
aVmore and more Americans are redefining what "better off" really means.
p63
aVTurns out, it has more to do with community and creativity
p64
aVthan dollars and cents.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, let me be very clear:
p67
aVthe 14.8 percent of Americans living in poverty need money,
p68
aVplain and simple.
p69
aVAnd all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation
p70
aVby employers and financial institutions.
p71
aVNothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor
p72
aVis anything but profoundly immoral.
p73
aVBut,
p74
aVtoo often we let the conversation stop there.
p75
aVWe talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience;
p76
aVabout the poor as if they were solely victims.
p77
aVPart of what I've learned in my research and reporting
p78
aVis that the art of living well
p79
aVis often practiced most masterfully
p80
aVby the most vulnerable.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, if necessity is the mother of invention,
p83
aVI've come to believe
p84
aVthat recession can be the father of consciousness.
p85
aVIt confronts us with profound questions,
p86
aVquestions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask
p87
aVin times of relative comfort.
p88
aVHow should we work?
p89
aVHow should we live?
p90
aVAll of us, whether we realize it or not,
p91
aVseek answers to these questions,
p92
aVwith our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears.
p93
aa(lp94
VMy great-grandfather was a drunk in Detroit,
p95
aVwho sometimes managed to hold down a factory job.
p96
aVHe had, as unbelievable as it might sound,
p97
aV21 children,
p98
aVwith one woman, my great-grandmother,
p99
aVwho died at 47 years old of ovarian cancer.
p100
aVNow, I'm pregnant with my second child,
p101
aVand I cannot even fathom what she must have gone through.
p102
aVAnd if you're trying to do the math \u2014 there were six sets of twins.
p103
aVSo my grandfather, their son,
p104
aVbecame a traveling salesman,
p105
aVand he lived boom and bust.
p106
aVSo my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors
p107
aVand pretending his parents weren't home.
p108
aVHe actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage,
p109
aVwhen his father admitted he didn't have money
p110
aVto go back to the orthodontist.
p111
aVSo my dad, unsurprisingly,
p112
aVbecame a bankruptcy lawyer.
p113
aVCouldn't write this in a novel, right?
p114
aVHe was obsessed with providing a secure foundation
p115
aVfor my brother and I.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo I ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle.
p118
aVMy parents made sure that I grew up on a kind of steady ground
p119
aVthat allows one to question and risk and leap.
p120
aVAnd ironically, and probably sometimes to their frustration,
p121
aVit is their steadfast commitment to security
p122
aVthat allows me to question its value,
p123
aVor at least its value as we've historically defined it
p124
aVin the 21st century.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo let's dig into this first question:
p127
aVHow should we work?
p128
aVWe should work like our mothers.
p129
aVThat's right \u2014 we've spent decades
p130
aVtrying to fit women into a work world built for company men.
p131
aVAnd many have done backbends to fit in,
p132
aVbut others have carved a more unconventional path,
p133
aVcreating a patchwork of meaning and money
p134
aVwith enough flexibility to do what they need to do
p135
aVfor those that they love.
p136
aVMy mom called it "just making it work."
p137
aVToday I hear life coaches call it "a portfolio career."
p138
aVWhatever you call it,
p139
aVmore and more men are craving these whole, if not harried, lives.
p140
aVThey're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, artist Ann Hamilton has said,
p143
aV"Labor is a way of knowing."
p144
aVLabor is a way of knowing.
p145
aVIn other words, what we work on
p146
aVis what we understand about the world.
p147
aVIf this is true, and I think it is,
p148
aVthen women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones
p149
aVand the sick ones and the aging ones,
p150
aVhave disproportionately benefited
p151
aVfrom the most profound kind of knowing there is:
p152
aVknowing the human condition.
p153
aVBy prioritizing care,
p154
aVmen are, in a sense, staking their claim
p155
aVto the full range of human existence.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, this means the nine-to-five no longer works for anyone.
p158
aVPunch clocks are becoming obsolete, as are career ladders.
p159
aVWhole industries are being born and dying every day.
p160
aVIt's all nonlinear from here.
p161
aVSo we need to stop asking kids,
p162
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p163
aVand start asking them, "How do you want to be when you grow up?"
p164
aVTheir work will constantly change.
p165
aVThe common denominator is them.
p166
aVSo the more they understand their gifts
p167
aVand create crews of ideal collaborators,
p168
aVthe better off they will be.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net
p171
aVto fit this increasingly fragmented economy.
p172
aVWe need portable health benefits.
p173
aVWe need policies that reflect that everyone deserves to be vulnerable
p174
aVor care for vulnerable others,
p175
aVwithout becoming destitute.
p176
aVWe need to seriously consider a universal basic income.
p177
aVWe need to reinvent labor organizing.
p178
aVThe promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit
p179
aVour 21st century values,
p180
aVnot some archaic idea about bringing home the bacon,
p181
aVis long overdue \u2014
p182
aVjust ask your mother.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, how about the second question:
p185
aVHow should we live?
p186
aVWe should live
p187
aVlike our immigrant ancestors.
p188
aVWhen they came to America,
p189
aVthey often shared apartments, survival tactics, child care \u2014
p190
aValways knew how to fill one more belly,
p191
aVno matter how small the food available.
p192
aVBut they were told that success meant leaving the village behind
p193
aVand pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream,
p194
aVthe white picket fence.
p195
aVAnd even today, we see a white picket fence
p196
aVand we think success, self-possession.
p197
aVBut when you strip away the sentimentality,
p198
aVwhat it really does is divides us.
p199
aVMany Americans are rejecting the white picket fence
p200
aVand the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it,
p201
aVand reclaiming village life,
p202
aVreclaiming interdependence instead.
p203
aa(lp204
VFifty million of us, for example,
p205
aVlive in intergenerational households.
p206
aVThis number exploded with the Great Recession,
p207
aVbut it turns out people actually like living this way.
p208
aVTwo-thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof
p209
aVsay it's improved their relationships.
p210
aVSome people are choosing to share homes not with family,
p211
aVbut with other people who understand the health and economic benefits
p212
aVof daily community.
p213
aVCoAbode, an online platform for single moms looking to share homes
p214
aVwith other single moms,
p215
aVhas 50,000 users.
p216
aVAnd people over 65 are especially prone
p217
aVto be looking for these alternative living arrangements.
p218
aVThey understand that their quality of life
p219
aVdepends on a mix of solitude and solidarity.
p220
aVWhich is true of all of us when you think about it,
p221
aVyoung and old alike.
p222
aVFor too long, we've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle.
p223
aVBut all the research proves otherwise.
p224
aVIt shows that the healthiest, happiest and even safest \u2014
p225
aVin terms of both climate change disaster, in terms of crime, all of that \u2014
p226
aVare Americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, I've experienced this firsthand.
p229
aVFor the last few years, I've been living in a cohousing community.
p230
aVIt's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,
p231
aVthis prolific blackberry bush that snakes around a community garden,
p232
aVall smack-dab, by the way, in the middle of urban Oakland.
p233
aVThe nine units are all built to be different,
p234
aVdifferent sizes, different shapes,
p235
aVbut they're meant to be as green as possible.
p236
aVSo big, shiny black solar cells on our roof
p237
aVmean our electricity bill rarely exceeds
p238
aVmore than five bucks in a month.
p239
aVThe 25 of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions
p240
aVand professions,
p241
aVand we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have.
p242
aVBut additionally,
p243
aVwe share an industrial-sized kitchen and eating area,
p244
aVwhere we have common meals twice a week.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow, people, when I tell them I live like this,
p247
aVoften have one of two extreme reactions.
p248
aVEither they say, "Why doesn't everyone live like this?"
p249
aVOr they say, "That sounds totally horrifying.
p250
aVI would never want to do that."
p251
aVSo let me reassure you: there is a sacred respect for privacy among us,
p252
aVbut also a commitment to what we call "radical hospitality" \u2014
p253
aVnot the kind advertised by the Four Seasons,
p254
aVbut the kind that says that every single person is worthy of kindness,
p255
aVfull stop, end of sentence.
p256
aa(lp257
VThe biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this?
p258
aVYou share all the domestic labor \u2014 the repairing, the cooking, the weeding \u2014
p259
aVbut you also share the emotional labor.
p260
aVRather than depending only on the idealized family unit
p261
aVto get all of your emotional needs met,
p262
aVyou have two dozen other people that you can go to
p263
aVto talk about a hard day at work
p264
aVor troubleshoot how to handle an abusive teacher.
p265
aVTeenagers in our community will often go to an adult that is not their parent
p266
aVto ask for advice.
p267
aVIt's what bell hooks called "revolutionary parenting,"
p268
aVthis humble acknowledgment
p269
aVthat kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults
p270
aVto emulate and count on.
p271
aVTurns out, adults are healthier, too.
p272
aVIt's a lot of pressure,
p273
aVtrying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe "new better off," as I've come to call it,
p276
aVis less about investing in the perfect family
p277
aVand more about investing in the imperfect village,
p278
aVwhether that's relatives living under one roof,
p279
aVa cohousing community like mine,
p280
aVor just a bunch of neighbors who pledge to really know
p281
aVand look out for one another.
p282
aVIt's good common sense, right?
p283
aVAnd yet, money has often made us dumb
p284
aVabout reaching out.
p285
aVThe most reliable wealth
p286
aVis found in relationship.
p287
aa(lp288
VThe new better off is not an individual prospect at all.
p289
aVIn fact, if you're a failure or you think you're a failure,
p290
aVI've got some good news for you:
p291
aVyou might be a success by standards you have not yet honored.
p292
aVMaybe you're a mediocre earner but a masterful father.
p293
aVMaybe you can't afford your dream home,
p294
aVbut you throw legendary neighborhood parties.
p295
aVIf you're a textbook success,
p296
aVthe implications of what I'm saying could be more grim for you.
p297
aVYou might be a failure by standards you hold dear
p298
aVbut that the world doesn't reward.
p299
aVOnly you can know.
p300
aa(lp301
VI know that I am not a tribute
p302
aVto my great-grandmother,
p303
aVwho lived such a short and brutish life,
p304
aVif I earn enough money to afford every creature comfort.
p305
aVYou can't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning.
p306
aVThere is no home big enough
p307
aVto erase the pain that she must have endured.
p308
aVI am a tribute to her
p309
aVif I live a life as connected and courageous as possible.
p310
aVIn the midst of such widespread uncertainty,
p311
aVwe may, in fact, be insecure.
p312
aVBut we can let that insecurity make us brittle
p313
aVor supple.
p314
aVWe can turn inward, lose faith in the power of institutions to change \u2014
p315
aVeven lose faith in ourselves.
p316
aVOr we can turn outward,
p317
aVcultivate faith in our ability to reach out, to connect, to create.
p318
aa(lp319
VTurns out, the biggest danger
p320
aVis not failing to achieve the American Dream.
p321
aVThe biggest danger is achieving a dream
p322
aVthat you don't actually believe in.
p323
aVSo don't do that.
p324
aVDo the harder, more interesting thing,
p325
aVwhich is to compose a life where what you do every single day,
p326
aVthe people you give your best love and ingenuity and energy to,
p327
aValigns as closely as possible with what you believe.
p328
aVThat, not something as mundane as making money,
p329
aVis a tribute to your ancestors.
p330
aVThat is the beautiful struggle.
p331
aa(lp332
