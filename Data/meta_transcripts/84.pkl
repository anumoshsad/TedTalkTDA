VAs someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible
p4
aa(lp5
Vstanding in front of an audience is a cross between
p6
aVan out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,
p7
aVso please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments
p8
aVby relying on words on paper,
p9
aVand I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.
p10
aVI'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me
p11
aVto become a documentary photographer.
p12
aa(lp13
VI was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,
p14
aVand on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.
p15
aVThe war in Vietnam was raging;
p16
aVthe Civil Rights Movement was under way;
p17
aVand pictures had a powerful influence on me.
p18
aVOur political and military leaders were telling us one thing,
p19
aVand photographers were telling us another.
p20
aVI believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.
p21
aVTheir images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.
p22
aVThey not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.
p23
aVTheir pictures became part of our collective consciousness
p24
aVand, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,
p25
aVchange became not only possible, but inevitable.
p26
aa(lp27
VI saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,
p28
aVspecifically visual journalism, can bring into focus
p29
aVboth the benefits and the cost of political policies.
p30
aVIt can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.
p31
aVIn the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,
p32
aVit becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage
p33
aVand asking us to reassess our behavior.
p34
aVIt puts a human face on issues
p35
aVwhich from afar can appear abstract
p36
aVor ideological or monumental in their global impact.
p37
aVWhat happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,
p38
aVhappens to ordinary citizens one by one.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I understood that documentary photography
p41
aVhas the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
p42
aVIt gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
p43
aVAnd as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion
p44
aVand gives impetus to public debate,
p45
aVthereby preventing the interested parties
p46
aVfrom totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.
p47
aVComing of age in those days made real
p48
aVthe concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital
p49
aVfor a free and dynamic society to function properly.
p50
aVThe press is certainly a business, and in order to survive
p51
aVit must be a successful business,
p52
aVbut the right balance must be found
p53
aVbetween marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.
p54
aa(lp55
VSociety's problems can't be solved until they're identified.
p56
aVOn a higher plane, the press is a service industry,
p57
aVand the service it provides is awareness.
p58
aVEvery story does not have to sell something.
p59
aVThere's also a time to give.
p60
aVThat was a tradition I wanted to follow.
p61
aVSeeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved
p62
aVand that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution \u2014
p63
aVI wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.
p64
aVBut I was driven by an inherent sense
p65
aVthat a picture that revealed the true face of war
p66
aVwould almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.
p67
aa(lp68
VI'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events
p69
aVand issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.
p70
aVIn 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.
p71
aV10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death
p72
aVin protest against conditions in jail.
p73
aVThe reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.
p74
aVI saw that the front lines of contemporary wars
p75
aVare not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.
p76
aVDuring the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,
p77
aVwhich was engulfed by civil wars
p78
aVthat straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn Guatemala, the central government \u2014
p81
aVcontrolled by a oligarchy of European decent \u2014
p82
aVwas waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,
p83
aVand I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:
p84
aVconquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.
p85
aVAn anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded
p86
aVas Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.
p87
aVA destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard
p88
aVwas left as a monument in a park in Managua,
p89
aVand was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.
p90
aVAt the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,
p91
aVand again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.
p92
aa(lp93
VI've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.
p94
aVThis is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,
p95
aVwhen it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.
p96
aVIn 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,
p97
aVand one of the major incidents was
p98
aVthe destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp
p99
aVin the West Bank town of Jenin.
p100
aVWithout the political will to find common ground,
p101
aVthe continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic
p102
aVonly creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,
p103
aVand perpetuates the cycle of violence.
p104
aa(lp105
VIn the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,
p106
aVYugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out
p107
aVbetween Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
p108
aVThis is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,
p109
aVneighbor against neighbor.
p110
aVA bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,
p111
aVwhere life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.
p112
aVA mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery
p113
aVand was used as a makeshift morgue.
p114
aVDead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle
p115
aVand used as barter for the return of prisoners
p116
aVor Bosnian soldiers killed in action.
p117
aVThis was once a park.
p118
aVThe Bosnian soldier who guided me
p119
aVtold me that all of his friends were there now.
p120
aa(lp121
VAt the same time in South Africa,
p122
aVafter Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,
p123
aVthe black population commenced the final phase
p124
aVof liberation from apartheid.
p125
aVOne of the things I had to learn as a journalist
p126
aVwas what to do with my anger.
p127
aVI had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something
p128
aVthat would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.
p129
aVIn Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.
p130
aVTeenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.
p131
aVAfter several weeks, they washed off the white
p132
aVand took on the full responsibilities of men.
p133
aVIt was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic
p134
aVof the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.
p135
aa(lp136
VChildren in Soweto playing on a trampoline.
p137
aVElsewhere in Africa there was famine.
p138
aVIn Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.
p139
aVFarmers were driven off their land,
p140
aVand crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.
p141
aVStarvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction \u2014
p142
aVprimitive but extremely effective.
p143
aVHundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,
p144
aVslowly and painfully.
p145
aVThe international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,
p146
aVand hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.
p147
aVAmerican troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,
p148
aVbut they were eventually drawn into the conflict,
p149
aVand after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.
p150
aVIn southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation
p151
aVas a means of genocide.
p152
aa(lp153
VAgain, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,
p154
aVstaged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.
p155
aVI'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.
p156
aVI also want it to be powerful and eloquent,
p157
aVand to do as much justice as possible
p158
aVto the experience of the people I'm photographing.
p159
aVThis man was in an NGO feeding center,
p160
aVbeing helped as much as he could be helped.
p161
aVHe literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,
p162
aVyet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.
p163
aVHe had not given up, and if he didn't give up,
p164
aVhow could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?
p165
aVIn 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,
p166
aVI saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,
p167
aVand it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.
p168
aVIt exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.
p169
aVThe next day I left for Rwanda,
p170
aVand it was like taking the express elevator to hell.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.
p173
aVHe allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,
p174
aVand he even turned his face toward the light,
p175
aVas if he wanted me to see him better.
p176
aVI think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.
p177
aVThis time, maybe confused or discouraged
p178
aVby the military disaster in Somalia,
p179
aVthe international community remained silent,
p180
aVand somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered
p181
aVby their own countrymen \u2014 sometimes their own neighbors \u2014
p182
aVusing farm implements as weapons.
p183
aa(lp184
VPerhaps because a lesson had been learned
p185
aVby the weak response to the war in Bosnia
p186
aVand the failure in Rwanda,
p187
aVwhen Serbia attacked Kosovo,
p188
aVinternational action was taken much more decisively.
p189
aVNATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.
p190
aVEthnic Albanians had been murdered,
p191
aVtheir farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.
p192
aVThey were received in refugee camps
p193
aVset up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.
p194
aVThe imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.
p195
aVThe image reminded me of a cave painting,
p196
aVand echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.
p197
aa(lp198
VBetween 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars
p199
aVin Chechnya from inside Grozny.
p200
aVThis is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.
p201
aVThe Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,
p202
aVkilling mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.
p203
aVI found a boy from the local orphanage
p204
aVwandering around the front line.
p205
aVMy work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war
p206
aVto a focus on critical social issues as well.
p207
aVAfter the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania
p208
aVand discovered a kind of gulag of children,
p209
aVwhere thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.
p210
aVCeausescu had imposed a quota
p211
aVon the number of children to be produced by each family,
p212
aVthereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.
p213
aVChildren who couldn't be supported by their families
p214
aVwere raised in government orphanages.
p215
aVChildren with birth defects were labeled incurables,
p216
aVand confined for life to inhuman conditions.
p217
aa(lp218
VAs reports began to surface, again international aid went in.
p219
aVGoing deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,
p220
aVI worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,
p221
aVwhere there had been no regard for the environment
p222
aVor the health of either workers or the general population.
p223
aVAn aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia
p224
aVwas filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,
p225
aVand four out of five workers came down with cancer.
p226
aa(lp227
VAfter the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,
p228
aVI began to explore conditions of poverty
p229
aVin a country that was on its way towards modernization.
p230
aVI spent a good deal of time with a man
p231
aVwho lived with his family on a railway embankment
p232
aVand had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.
p233
aVWhen the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.
p234
aVA trust fund was established,
p235
aVand the family now lives in a house in the countryside
p236
aVand all their basic necessities are taken care of.
p237
aVIt was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.
p238
aVJournalism had provided a channel
p239
aVfor people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.
p240
aVI met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,
p241
aVand ended up living in a train station.
p242
aVBy the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.
p243
aVThe rural poor had become the urban poor,
p244
aVand in the process, they'd become invisible.
p245
aa(lp246
VThese heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan
p247
aVreminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:
p248
aVisolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.
p249
aVAgent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War
p250
aVto deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.
p251
aVThe active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical
p252
aVthat was sprayed in vast quantities,
p253
aVand whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.
p254
aVIn 2000, I began documenting global health issues,
p255
aVconcentrating first on AIDS in Africa.
p256
aVI tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.
p257
aVI thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,
p258
aVwhether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo many children have been orphaned by the epidemic
p261
aVthat grandmothers have taken the place of parents,
p262
aVand a lot of children had been born with HIV.
p263
aVA hospital in Zambia.
p264
aVI began documenting the close connection
p265
aVbetween HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.
p266
aVThis is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.
p267
aVMy pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs
p268
aVby shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.
p269
aVI went to Congo with MSF,
p270
aVand contributed to a book and an exhibition
p271
aVthat focused attention on a forgotten war
p272
aVin which millions of people have died,
p273
aVand exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.
p274
aVA malnourished child being measured
p275
aVas part of the supplemental feeding program.
p276
aa(lp277
VIn the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.
p278
aVThis time I was on assignment for a magazine,
p279
aVbut again worked closely with MSF.
p280
aVThe international community still hasn't found a way
p281
aVto create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.
p282
aVAn MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.
p283
aVI've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.
p284
aVThis is a scene from New Orleans.
p285
aVA prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama
p286
aVwas punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.
p287
aVThis experience raised a lot of questions,
p288
aVamong them questions about race and equality
p289
aVand for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.
p290
aVIn the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.
p291
aa(lp292
VI didn't see either of the planes hit,
p293
aVand when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,
p294
aVand I thought it might have been an accident.
p295
aVA few minutes later when I looked again
p296
aVand saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.
p297
aVIn the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.
p298
aVI'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 \u2014
p299
aVnot only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.
p300
aVAt the time I was photographing in these different places,
p301
aVI thought I was covering separate stories,
p302
aVbut on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood
p303
aVI'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,
p304
aVand the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan
p307
aVat the end of the civil war,
p308
aVshortly before the city fell to the Taliban.
p309
aVLand mine victims being helped
p310
aVat the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.
p311
aVA boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.
p312
aVI'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world
p313
aVfrom political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.
p314
aVI understood that in its suffering,
p315
aVthe Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?
p316
aVA Taliban fighter shot during a battle
p317
aVas the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.
p318
aVWhen war with Iraq was imminent,
p319
aVI realized the American troops would be very well covered,
p320
aVso I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.
p321
aVA marketplace was hit by a mortar shell
p322
aVthat killed several members of a single family.
p323
aVA day after American forces entered Baghdad,
p324
aVa company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers
p325
aVand were cheered on by the crowds \u2014
p326
aVa hopeful moment that was short lived.
p327
aa(lp328
VFor the first time in years,
p329
aVShi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage
p330
aVto Karbala to observe Ashura,
p331
aVand I was amazed by the sheer number of people
p332
aVand how fervently they practiced their religion.
p333
aVA group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.
p334
aVIt was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,
p335
aVand we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.
p336
aVLast year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,
p337
aVfrom the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.
p338
aa(lp339
VThis is a helicopter medic giving CPR
p340
aVto a soldier who had been shot in the head.
p341
aVMilitary medicine has become so efficient
p342
aVthat the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded
p343
aVis much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.
p344
aVThe signature weapon of the war is the IED,
p345
aVand the signature wound is severe leg damage.
p346
aVAfter enduring extreme pain and trauma,
p347
aVthe wounded face a grueling physical
p348
aVand psychological struggle in rehab.
p349
aVThe spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.
p350
aVI tried to imagine myself in their place,
p351
aVand I was totally humbled by their courage and determination
p352
aVin the face of such catastrophic loss.
p353
aVGood people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.
p354
aVOne day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing
p355
aVand all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go."
p356
aVAnd they went surfing.
p357
aa(lp358
VPhotographers go to the extreme edges of human experience
p359
aVto show people what's going on.
p360
aVSometimes they put their lives on the line,
p361
aVbecause they believe your opinions and your influence matter.
p362
aVThey aim their pictures at your best instincts,
p363
aVgenerosity, a sense of right and wrong,
p364
aVthe ability and the willingness to identify with others,
p365
aVthe refusal to accept the unacceptable.
p366
aVMy TED wish:
p367
aVthere's a vital story that needs to be told,
p368
aVand I wish for TED to help me gain access to it
p369
aVand then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways
p370
aVto use news photography in the digital era.
