(lp3
VThank you very much. Good evening.
p4
aa(lp5
VSome of you may have noticed that my last name is Nutt.
p6
aVAnd if you did, you are forgiven for wondering
p7
aVhow a Nutt managed to end up in a war zone.
p8
aVI actually was offered, right out of medical school, and accepted
p9
aVa volunteer contract to work with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,
p10
aVthat was worth one dollar.
p11
aVAnd, you see, I had to be paid this dollar
p12
aVin the event that the UN needed to issue an evacuation order,
p13
aVso that I would be covered.
p14
aVI was, after all, heading into one of the world's most dangerous places.
p15
aVAnd by now, some of you may be asking yourselves,
p16
aVand I just want to reassure you,
p17
aVthat I did get half the money up front.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VBut you see, this is how, with 50 cents in my pocket,
p22
aVI ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.
p23
aVJournalists called it the "city of death."
p24
aVAnd they called it the city of death
p25
aVbecause 300,000 people had lost their lives there \u2014
p26
aV300,000 people,
p27
aVmostly as a result of war-related famine and disease.
p28
aa(lp29
VI was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out
p30
aVhow best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.
p31
aVIt was right on the heels of the Rwandan genocide,
p32
aVand aid money to the region was drying up.
p33
aVMany aid organizations, unfortunately,
p34
aVhad been forced to close their doors.
p35
aVAnd so the question that I was asked to specifically help answer,
p36
aVwhich is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over,
p37
aVis: What the hell do we do now?
p38
aVYou know, the security environment in Somalia at that moment in time \u2014
p39
aVand nothing has really changed too much \u2014
p40
aVcan best be described as "Mad Max" by way of "A Clockwork Orange."
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival,
p43
aVI went up to a feeding clinic.
p44
aVThere were dozens of women who were standing in line,
p45
aVand they were clutching their infants very close.
p46
aVAbout 20 minutes into this conversation I was having
p47
aVwith this one young woman,
p48
aVI leaned forward
p49
aVand tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby's hand.
p50
aVAnd when I did this,
p51
aVI discovered that her baby was already in rigor.
p52
aVShe was stiff,
p53
aVand her little, lifeless hand was curled into itself.
p54
aVShe had died hours before
p55
aVof malnutrition and dehydration.
p56
aVI later learned that as her baby was dying,
p57
aVthis young woman had been held for two days
p58
aVby some teenage boys who were armed with Kalashnikov rifles,
p59
aVand they were trying to shake her down for more money,
p60
aVmoney she very clearly did not have.
p61
aVAnd this is a scene that I have confronted
p62
aVin war zones the world over;
p63
aVplaces where kids, some as young as eight \u2014 they are this big \u2014
p64
aVand those kids, they have never been to school.
p65
aVBut they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles.
p66
aa(lp67
VIs this just the way the world is?
p68
aVSome will you tell you that war is unavoidably human.
p69
aVAfter all, it is as old as existence itself.
p70
aVWe say never again, and yet it happens again and again and again.
p71
aVBut I will tell you that I have seen the absolute worst
p72
aVof what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another,
p73
aVand yet I still believe a different outcome is possible.
p74
aVDo you want to know why?
p75
aVBecause over 20 years of doing this work,
p76
aVgoing in and out of war zones around the world,
p77
aVI have come to understand
p78
aVthat there are aspects of this problem
p79
aVthat we, all of us, as people occupying this shared space,
p80
aVthat we can change \u2014
p81
aVnot through force or coercion or invasion,
p82
aVbut by simply looking at all of the options available to us
p83
aVand choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war,
p84
aVinstead of war at the expense of peace.
p85
aa(lp86
VHow so?
p87
aVWell, I want you to consider this:
p88
aVthere are at least 800 million small arms and light weapons
p89
aVin circulation in the world today.
p90
aVThe vast majority of civilians, like that young baby,
p91
aVwho are dying in war zones around the world,
p92
aVare dying at the hands of various armed groups
p93
aVwho rely on a near-infinite supply of cheap, easy and efficient weapons
p94
aVto rape, threaten, intimidate and brutalize those civilians
p95
aVat every turn.
p96
aVHow cheap?
p97
aVWell, in some parts of the world,
p98
aVyou can buy an AK-47 for as little as 10 dollars.
p99
aVIn many places in which I have worked,
p100
aVit is easier to get access to an automatic rifle
p101
aVthan it is to get access to clean drinking water.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd so now the important part:
p104
aVCan anything be done about this?
p105
aVTo answer that question,
p106
aVlet's take a look at this map of the world.
p107
aVAnd now, let's add in all of the countries that are currently at war,
p108
aVand the number of people who have either died
p109
aVor have been displaced as a result of that violence.
p110
aVIt is a staggering number \u2014
p111
aVmore than 40 million people.
p112
aVBut you will also notice something else about this map.
p113
aVYou will notice that most of those countries
p114
aVare in the Global South.
p115
aVNow, let's look at the countries
p116
aVthat are the world's top 20 exporters of small arms in the world.
p117
aVAnd what do we notice?
p118
aVWell, you see them in green.
p119
aVYou will notice that those are mostly countries in the Global North,
p120
aVprimarily Western countries.
p121
aVWhat does this tell us?
p122
aVThis tells us that most of the people who are dying in war
p123
aVare living in poor countries,
p124
aVand yet most of the people who are profiting from war
p125
aVare living in rich countries \u2014 people like you and me.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd then what if we go beyond small arms for a second.
p128
aVWhat if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world?
p129
aVWho does the biggest business?
p130
aVWell, roughly 80 percent of those weapons
p131
aVcome from none other than the five permanent members
p132
aVof the United Nations Security Council,
p133
aVplus Germany.
p134
aVIt's shocking, isn't it?
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, some of you might be saying at this moment in time,
p137
aV"Oh yeah, but OK, hang on a second there ... Nutt."
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VGrade school was spectacular for me.
p142
aVIt was, really, a wonderful experience.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VBut you might be saying to yourselves,
p147
aVYou know, all of these weapons in war zones \u2014 they're not a cause,
p148
aVbut an effect of the violence that plagues them
p149
aVeach and every single day.
p150
aVYou know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan,
p151
aVwhere they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order,
p152
aVpromote peace and security, to combat terror groups \u2014
p153
aVsurely this is a good thing.
p154
aa(lp155
VLet's take a look at that assumption for just one moment,
p156
aVbecause you see there has been a boom in the small-arms trade
p157
aVsince the start of the War on Terror.
p158
aVIn fact, it is a business that has grown threefold
p159
aVover the past 15 years.
p160
aVAnd now let's compare that to the number of people
p161
aVwho have directly died in armed conflict around the world
p162
aVin that same period.
p163
aVWhat do you notice?
p164
aVWell, you notice that, in fact, that also goes up
p165
aVroughly three- to fourfold.
p166
aVThey basically go up and end at the same point.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, we can have a circular argument here
p169
aVabout whether this increase in fatalities is a response
p170
aVto the increase of small arms, or the other way around.
p171
aVBut here's what we should really take away from this.
p172
aVWhat we should take away from this
p173
aVis that this is a relationship worth scrutinizing,
p174
aVespecially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to Iraq
p175
aVfor use by the Iraqi Army,
p176
aVor to Syria for so-called moderate opposition fighters,
p177
aVthat those arms, many of them, are now in the hands of ISIS;
p178
aVor when you consider that arms that were shipped to Libya
p179
aVare now actively drifting across the Sahel,
p180
aVand ending up with groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda
p181
aVand other militant groups.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd therein lies the problem.
p184
aVBecause, you see,
p185
aVsmall arms anywhere are a menace everywhere,
p186
aVbecause their first stop is rarely their last.
p187
aa(lp188
VSpending on war per person per year
p189
aVnow amounts to about 249 dollars \u2014
p190
aV249 dollars per person,
p191
aVwhich is roughly 12 times what we spend on foreign aid,
p192
aVmoney that is used to educate and vaccinate children
p193
aVand combat malnutrition in the Global South.
p194
aVBut we can shift that balance.
p195
aVHow do we do this?
p196
aVWell, it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand,
p197
aVso we can tackle it from both sides.
p198
aa(lp199
VOn the supply side,
p200
aVwe can push our governments
p201
aVto adopt international arms transparency mechanisms
p202
aVlike the Arms Trade Treaty,
p203
aVwhich makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable
p204
aVfor where their arms are going
p205
aVand what their arms might be used for.
p206
aVHere in the United States,
p207
aVthe largest arms-exporting country in the world by far,
p208
aVPresident Obama has rightly signed the Arms Trade Treaty,
p209
aVbut none of it takes effect, it isn't binding,
p210
aVuntil it is approved and ratified by the Senate.
p211
aVThis is where we need to make our voices heard.
p212
aVYou know, the curbing of small arms \u2014
p213
aVit's not going to solve the problem of war.
p214
aVIncreased control mechanisms won't solve that problem.
p215
aVBut it's an important step in the right direction.
p216
aVAnd it's up to all of us who live in those rich countries
p217
aVto make change here.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat about on the demand side?
p220
aVYou know, there are generations around the world
p221
aVwho are being lost to war.
p222
aVIt is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence
p223
aVwith investments in education, in strengthening the rule of law
p224
aVand in economic development, especially for women.
p225
aVI have personally seen
p226
aVjust how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be
p227
aVaround the world.
p228
aa(lp229
VBut here's the thing:
p230
aVthey take time,
p231
aVwhich means for you as individuals, if you want to give,
p232
aVplease, by all means do it.
p233
aVBut know that how you give is just as important
p234
aVas how much you give.
p235
aVRegular contributions like monthly contributions
p236
aVare a far more effective way of giving,
p237
aVbecause they allow humanitarian organizations
p238
aVto properly plan and be invested over the long term,
p239
aVand to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war,
p240
aVwars that many of us, frankly, all too quickly forget.
p241
aa(lp242
VWhen I first got on that plane for Somalia as a young doctor,
p243
aVI had no idea what it meant to live with war.
p244
aVBut I can tell you that I know what it means now.
p245
aVAnd I know what it means
p246
aVto lie in bed in the pitch-black night
p247
aVand listen to that haunting "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"
p248
aVof automatic gunfire,
p249
aVand wonder with absolute dread
p250
aVhow many minutes I have left until it will be right on top of me.
p251
aVI can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear,
p252
aVone that millions of people around the world are forced to confront
p253
aVeach and every single day,
p254
aVespecially children.
p255
aVOver the years of doing this work,
p256
aVunfortunately, war has killed far too many people close to me.
p257
aVAnd on at least a couple of occasions,
p258
aVwar has very nearly killed me as well.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut I firmly believe,
p261
aVwhich is why I get up and do what I do every single day,
p262
aVthat we can make different choices here.
p263
aVBecause you see, war is ours,
p264
aVas human beings.
p265
aVWe buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.
p266
aVWe are therefore not powerless to solve it.
p267
aVOn the contrary,
p268
aVwe are the only ones who can.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you very much, and I want to wish you the greatest success.
