VThe murder happened a little over 21 years ago,
p4
aVJanuary the 18th, 1991,
p5
aVin a small
p6
aVbedroom community
p7
aVof Lynwood, California, just a few miles
p8
aVsoutheast of Los Angeles.
p9
aVA father came out of his house
p10
aVto tell his teenage son and his five friends
p11
aVthat it was time for them to stop horsing around
p12
aVon the front lawn and on the sidewalk,
p13
aVto get home, finish their schoolwork,
p14
aVand prepare themselves for bed.
p15
aVAnd as the father was administering these instructions,
p16
aVa car drove by, slowly,
p17
aVand just after it passed the father and the teenagers,
p18
aVa hand went out from the front passenger window,
p19
aVand \u2014 "Bam, Bam!" \u2014 killing the father.
p20
aVAnd the car sped off.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe police,
p23
aVinvestigating officers, were amazingly efficient.
p24
aVThey considered all the usual culprits,
p25
aVand in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:
p26
aVFrancisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid
p27
aVwho lived about two or three blocks away
p28
aVfrom where the shooting occurred.
p29
aVThey found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,
p30
aVand the day after the shooting,
p31
aVthey showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,
p32
aV"That's the picture.
p33
aVThat's the shooter I saw that killed the father."
p34
aa(lp35
VThat was all a preliminary hearing judge had
p36
aVto listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial
p37
aVfor a first-degree murder.
p38
aVIn the investigation that followed before the actual trial,
p39
aVeach of the other five teenagers was shown
p40
aVphotographs, the same photo array.
p41
aVThe picture that we best can determine was probably
p42
aVthe one that they were shown in the photo array
p43
aVis in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.
p44
aVThe reason we're not sure absolutely is because
p45
aVof the nature of evidence preservation
p46
aVin our judicial system,
p47
aVbut that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo at the actual trial,
p50
aVall six of the teenagers testified,
p51
aVand indicated the identifications they had made
p52
aVin the photo array.
p53
aVHe was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,
p54
aVand transported to Folsom Prison.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo what's wrong?
p57
aVStraightforward, fair trial, full investigation.
p58
aVOh yes, no gun was ever found.
p59
aVNo vehicle was ever identified as being the one
p60
aVin which the shooter had extended his arm,
p61
aVand no person was ever charged with being the driver
p62
aVof the shooter's vehicle.
p63
aVAnd Mr. Carrillo's alibi?
p64
aVWhich of those parents here in the room might not lie
p65
aVconcerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter
p66
aVin an investigation of a killing?
p67
aa(lp68
VSent to prison,
p69
aVadamantly insisting on his innocence,
p70
aVwhich he has consistently for 21 years.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what's the problem?
p73
aVThe problems, actually, for this kind of case
p74
aVcome manyfold from decades of scientific research
p75
aVinvolving human memory.
p76
aVFirst of all, we have all the statistical analyses
p77
aVfrom the Innocence Project work,
p78
aVwhere we know that we have, what,
p79
aV250, 280 documented cases now where people have
p80
aVbeen wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,
p81
aVsome from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,
p82
aVand you know that over three quarters of all of those cases
p83
aVof exoneration involved only eyewitness identification
p84
aVtestimony during the trial that convicted them.
p85
aVWe know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe other comes from an interesting aspect
p88
aVof human memory that's related to various brain functions
p89
aVbut I can sum up for the sake of brevity here
p90
aVin a simple line:
p91
aVThe brain abhors a vacuum.
p92
aVUnder the best of observation conditions,
p93
aVthe absolute best,
p94
aVwe only detect, encode and store in our brains
p95
aVbits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,
p96
aVand they're stored in different parts of the brain.
p97
aVSo now, when it's important for us to be able to recall
p98
aVwhat it was that we experienced,
p99
aVwe have an incomplete, we have a partial store,
p100
aVand what happens?
p101
aVBelow awareness, with no requirement for any kind of
p102
aVmotivated processing, the brain fills in information
p103
aVthat was not there,
p104
aVnot originally stored,
p105
aVfrom inference, from speculation,
p106
aVfrom sources of information that came to you,
p107
aVas the observer, after the observation.
p108
aVBut it happens without awareness such that
p109
aVyou don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.
p110
aVIt's called reconstructed memories.
p111
aVIt happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.
p112
aVIt was those two considerations, among others \u2014
p113
aVreconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility \u2014
p114
aVthat was part of the instigation
p115
aVfor a group of appeal attorneys
p116
aVled by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers
p117
aVto pool their experience and their talents together
p118
aVand petition a superior court
p119
aVfor a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.
p120
aVThey retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,
p121
aVbecause I had expertise
p122
aVin eyewitness memory identification,
p123
aVwhich obviously makes sense for this case, right?
p124
aVBut also because I have expertise and testify about
p125
aVthe nature of human night vision.
p126
aa(lp127
VWell, what's that got to do with this?
p128
aVWell, when you read through the case materials
p129
aVin this Carrillo case,
p130
aVone of the things that suddenly strikes you is that
p131
aVthe investigating officers said the lighting was good
p132
aVat the crime scene, at the shooting.
p133
aVAll the teenagers testified during the trial
p134
aVthat they could see very well.
p135
aVBut this occurred in mid-January,
p136
aVin the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.
p137
aVSo when I did the calculations
p138
aVfor the lunar data and the solar data
p139
aVat that location on Earth at the time of the incident
p140
aVof the shooting, all right,
p141
aVit was well past the end of civil twilight
p142
aVand there was no moon up that night.
p143
aVSo all the light in this area from the sun and the moon
p144
aVis what you see on the screen right here.
p145
aVThe only lighting in that area had to come
p146
aVfrom artificial sources,
p147
aVand that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction
p148
aVof the scene with photometers, with various measures
p149
aVof illumination and various other measures of
p150
aVcolor perception, along with special cameras
p151
aVand high-speed film, right?
p152
aVTake all the measurements and record them, right?
p153
aVAnd then take photographs, and this is what the scene
p154
aVlooked like at the time of the shooting
p155
aVfrom the position of the teenagers
p156
aVlooking at the car going by and shooting.
p157
aVThis is looking directly across the street
p158
aVfrom where they were standing.
p159
aVRemember, the investigating officers' report said
p160
aVthe lighting was good.
p161
aVThe teenagers said they could see very well.
p162
aVThis is looking down to the east,
p163
aVwhere the shooting vehicle sped off,
p164
aVand this is the lighting directly behind the father
p165
aVand the teenagers.
p166
aVAs you can see, it is at best poor.
p167
aVNo one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,
p168
aVand in fact, as nice as these pictures are,
p169
aVand the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,
p170
aVand a picture is worth more than a thousand words
p171
aVwhen you're trying to communicate numbers,
p172
aVabstract concepts like lux, the international measurement
p173
aVof illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.
p174
aVWhen you present those to people who are not well-versed
p175
aVin those aspects of science and that, they become
p176
aVsalamanders in the noonday sun. It's like
p177
aVtalking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?
p178
aVTheir eyes just glaze over, all right?
p179
aVA good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,
p180
aVa good communicator, and that's part of the reason
p181
aVwhy we take the pictures, to show not only
p182
aVwhere the light sources are, and what we call the spill,
p183
aVthe distribution, but also so that it's easier
p184
aVfor the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.
p185
aVSo these are some of the pictures that, in fact,
p186
aVI used when I testified,
p187
aVbut more importantly were, to me as a scientist,
p188
aVare those readings, the photometer readings,
p189
aVwhich I can then convert into actual predictions
p190
aVof the visual capability of the human eye
p191
aVunder those circumstances,
p192
aVand from my readings that I recorded at the scene
p193
aVunder the same solar and lunar conditions
p194
aVat the same time, so on and so forth, right,
p195
aVI could predict
p196
aVthat there would be no reliable color perception,
p197
aVwhich is crucial for face recognition,
p198
aVand that there would be only scotopic vision,
p199
aVwhich means there would be very little resolution,
p200
aVwhat we call boundary or edge detection,
p201
aVand that furthermore, because the eyes would have been
p202
aVtotally dilated under this light, the depth of field,
p203
aVthe distance at which you can focus and see details,
p204
aVwould have been less than 18 inches away.
p205
aa(lp206
VI testified to that to the court,
p207
aVand while the judge was very attentive,
p208
aVit had been a very, very long hearing
p209
aVfor this petition for a retrial, and as a result,
p210
aVI noticed out of the corner of my eye
p211
aVthat I thought that maybe the judge was going to need
p212
aVa little more of a nudge
p213
aVthan just more numbers.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd here I became a bit audacious,
p216
aVand I turned
p217
aVand I asked the judge,
p218
aVI said, "Your Honor, I think you should go out
p219
aVand look at the scene yourself."
p220
aa(lp221
VNow I may have used a tone which was more like a dare
p222
aVthan a request \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p223
aVbut nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage
p224
aVthat he said, "Yes, I will."
p225
aVA shocker in American jurisprudence.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo in fact, we found the same identical conditions,
p228
aVwe reconstructed the entire thing again,
p229
aVhe came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers
p230
aVto protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)
p231
aVWe had him stand actually slightly in the street,
p232
aVso closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,
p233
aVthan the actual teenagers were,
p234
aVso he stood a few feet from the curb
p235
aVtoward the middle of the street.
p236
aVWe had a car that came by,
p237
aVsame identical car as described by the teenagers, right?
p238
aVIt had a driver and a passenger,
p239
aVand after the car had passed the judge by,
p240
aVthe passenger extended his hand,
p241
aVpointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,
p242
aVjust as the teenagers had described it, right?
p243
aVNow, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,
p244
aVso he had a black object in his hand that was similar
p245
aVto the gun that was described.
p246
aVHe pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is the car 30 feet away from the judge.
p249
aVThere's an arm sticking out of the passenger side
p250
aVand pointed back at you.
p251
aVThat's 30 feet away.
p252
aVSome of the teenagers said that in fact the car
p253
aVwas 15 feet away when it shot.
p254
aVOkay. There's 15 feet.
p255
aa(lp256
VAt this point, I became a little concerned.
p257
aVThis judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.
p258
aVHe was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.
p259
aVI couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.
p260
aVI had no sense of how he was reacting to this,
p261
aVand after he looked at this reenactment,
p262
aVhe turned to me and he says,
p263
aV"Is there anything else you want me to look at?"
p264
aa(lp265
VI said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was
p266
aVemboldened by the scientific measurements that I had
p267
aVin my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,
p268
aVor whether it was just sheer stupidity,
p269
aVwhich is what the defense lawyers thought \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p270
aVwhen they heard me say,
p271
aV"Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there
p272
aVand I want the car to go around the block again
p273
aVand I want it to come and I want it to stop
p274
aVright in front of you, three to four feet away,
p275
aVand I want the passenger to extend his hand
p276
aVwith a black object and point it right at you,
p277
aVand you can look at it as long as you want."
p278
aVAnd that's what he saw. (Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VYou'll notice, which was also in my test report,
p281
aVall the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,
p282
aVwhich means that the shooter's face would
p283
aVhave been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.
p284
aVFurthermore, the roof of the car
p285
aVis causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car
p286
aVwhich is making it darker.
p287
aVAnd this is three to four feet away.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhy did I take the risk?
p290
aVI knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.
p291
aVThree to four feet, it might as well have been
p292
aVa football field away.
p293
aVThis is what he saw.
p294
aVHe went back, there was a few more days of evidence
p295
aVthat was heard. At the end of it,
p296
aVhe made the judgment that he was going to grant
p297
aVthe petition for a retrial.
p298
aVAnd furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo
p299
aVso that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense
p300
aVif the prosecution decided to retry him.
p301
aa(lp302
VWhich they decided not to.
p303
aVHe is now a freed man. (Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.
p308
aVHe \u2014 His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,
p309
aVright? And she had a little baby boy.
p310
aVHe and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach
p311
aVright now taking classes. (Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd what does this example \u2014
p314
aVwhat's important to keep in mind for ourselves?
p315
aa(lp316
VFirst of all, there's a long history of antipathy
p317
aVbetween science and the law
p318
aVin American jurisprudence.
p319
aVI could regale you with horror stories of ignorance
p320
aVover decades of experience as a forensic expert
p321
aVof just trying to get science into the courtroom.
p322
aVThe opposing council always fight it and oppose it.
p323
aa(lp324
VOne suggestion is that all of us become much more
p325
aVattuned to the necessity, through policy,
p326
aVthrough procedures,
p327
aVto get more science in the courtroom,
p328
aVand I think one large step toward that
p329
aVis more requirements,
p330
aVwith all due respect to the law schools,
p331
aVof science, technology, engineering, mathematics
p332
aVfor anyone going into the law,
p333
aVbecause they become the judges.
p334
aVThink about how we select our judges in this country.
p335
aVIt's very different than most other cultures. All right?
p336
aa(lp337
VThe other one that I want to suggest,
p338
aVthe caution that all of us have to have,
p339
aVI constantly have to remind myself,
p340
aVabout just how accurate are the memories
p341
aVthat we know are true, that we believe in?
p342
aVThere is decades of research,
p343
aVexamples and examples of cases like this,
p344
aVwhere individuals
p345
aVreally, really believe. None of those teenagers
p346
aVwho identified him
p347
aVthought that they were picking the wrong person.
p348
aVNone of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.
p349
aVWe all have to be very careful.
p350
aVAll our memories are reconstructed memories.
p351
aVThey are the product of what we originally experienced
p352
aVand everything that's happened afterwards.
p353
aVThey're dynamic.
p354
aVThey're malleable. They're volatile,
p355
aVand as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,
p356
aVthat the accuracy of our memories
p357
aVis not measured in how vivid they are
p358
aVnor how certain you are that they're correct.
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you. (Applause)
