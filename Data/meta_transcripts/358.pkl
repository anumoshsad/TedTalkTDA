VI want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,
p4
aVwhich are the two primary factors \u2014
p5
aVnot the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors \u2014
p6
aVwhich are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely \u2014
p7
aVbordering on the inevitable at this point,
p8
aVwhether one is in favor of that or not \u2014
p9
aVthat politics and religion are, in fact, themselves
p10
aVbetter conceptualized as kinds of technology,
p11
aVand subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider
p12
aVin the space of conceptual design.
p13
aa(lp14
VHere's what I mean. Politics and \u2014
p15
aVlet's focus on the political system in particular question here,
p16
aVwhich is the system of democracy.
p17
aVDemocracy, as a type of politics, is a technology
p18
aVfor the control and deployment of power.
p19
aVYou can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
p20
aVThe famous ones \u2014 despotism is a good one;
p21
aVanarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,
p22
aVto do it in a radically diffused fashion;
p23
aVand democracy is a set of technologies,
p24
aVwhich have the effect of, in principle,
p25
aVdiffusing the power source to a large number of people
p26
aVand then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,
p27
aVand who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern
p28
aVby virtue of what the broader public has done.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, consider religion \u2014 in this case Islam,
p31
aVwhich is the religion that, in some direct sense,
p32
aVcan be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.
p33
aVLet me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,
p34
aVbecause I think it's a potentially controversial statement.
p35
aVI would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.
p36
aVAt the beginning of the Bush administration,
p37
aVwhen President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,
p38
aVhe made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.
p39
aVIn fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.
p40
aVThat's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.
p41
aVAfter 9/11, the tables were turned.
p42
aVAnd the president decided, with his advisors,
p43
aVto undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.
p44
aVThat began with Afghanistan,
p45
aVand when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,
p46
aVa decision was made through the technology of democracy \u2014
p47
aVagain, notice, not a perfect technology \u2014
p48
aVbut through the technology of democracy
p49
aVthat this administration was going to push in the direction of another war \u2014
p50
aVthis time, a war in Iraq.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war"
p53
aVis that we have to acknowledge that Islam,
p54
aVas interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,
p55
aVwas a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014
p56
aVthe precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014
p57
aVand as a consequence, at one degree of remove,
p58
aVthe precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.
p59
aVAnd I would add that bin Laden and his followers
p60
aVare consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,
p61
aVor at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,
p62
aVand the world of Islam as they see and define it.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?
p65
aVWell, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.
p66
aVIt's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe
p67
aVin a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,
p68
aVbut it's also meant by the Islamists \u2014
p69
aVand I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam \u2014
p70
aVthey follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,
p71
aVwhether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.
p72
aVWithin the sphere of people who have that view,
p73
aVand it's a large number of people in the Muslim world
p74
aVwho disagree with bin Laden in his application,
p75
aVbut agree that Islam is the answer.
p76
aVIslam represents a way of engaging the world
p77
aVthrough which one can achieve certain desirable goals.
p78
aVAnd the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,
p79
aVpeace, justice and equality,
p80
aVbut on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, I don't want to leave a misimpression
p83
aVby identifying either of these propositions \u2014
p84
aVrather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam \u2014 as technologies.
p85
aVI don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.
p86
aVAnd I think a good way to prove this
p87
aVis simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was
p88
aVwhen deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.
p89
aVAnd I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:
p90
aVyou can't show a picture of democracy.
p91
aVYou can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.
p92
aVYou can show the Capitol \u2014
p93
aVI had the same problem when I was designing the cover
p94
aVof my forthcoming book, in fact \u2014
p95
aVwhat do you put on the cover to show democracy?
p96
aVAnd the same problem with respect to Islam.
p97
aVYou can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,
p98
aVbut there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.
p99
aVThat's because these are the kinds of concepts
p100
aVthat are not susceptible to easy representation.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.
p103
aVIt follows from that that all of the people in the world
p104
aVwho say that they are Muslims can, in principle,
p105
aVsubscribe to a wide range of different interpretations
p106
aVof what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.
p107
aVIn other words, unlike the word hope,
p108
aVwhich one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,
p109
aVand, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,
p110
aVthese are essentially contested concepts.
p111
aVThey're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.
p112
aVAnd as a consequence of this disagreement,
p113
aVit's very, very difficult for anyone to say,
p114
aV"I have the right version of Islam."
p115
aVYou know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon
p116
aVof George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."
p117
aVWell, so says George W. Bush.
p118
aVOther people would say it means something else.
p119
aVSome people would say that Islam means submission.
p120
aVOther people would say it means an acknowledgement
p121
aVor recognition of God's sovereignty.
p122
aVThere are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.
p123
aVAnd ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.
p124
aVSome people say that democracy consists basically in elections.
p125
aVOther people say no, that's not enough,
p126
aVthere have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.
p127
aVThese are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,
p128
aV"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean."
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, if Islam and democracy are at present
p131
aVin a moment of great confrontation,
p132
aVwhat does that mean?
p133
aVWell, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.
p134
aVYou could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,
p135
aVwhich was fear.
p136
aVFear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner
p137
aVand with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die
p138
aVas a consequence of this confrontation \u2014
p139
aVa confrontation which many, many people
p140
aVin the Muslim world do not want,
p141
aVmany, many people in the American democracy do not want,
p142
aVmany people elsewhere in the world do not want,
p143
aVbut which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people \u2014
p144
aVat least in the relevant space, which is the United States \u2014
p145
aVto actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.
p146
aVAnd I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes
p149
aVis that there's also a hopeful response to this.
p150
aVAnd the hopeful response derives from recognizing
p151
aVthat Islam and democracy are technologies.
p152
aVAnd by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.
p153
aVAnd they're manipulable in ways
p154
aVthat can produce some extremely positive outcomes.
p155
aVWhat do I have in mind?
p156
aVWell, all over the Muslim world there are people
p157
aVwho take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,
p158
aVfor whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,
p159
aVor just a source of powerful personal identity,
p160
aVwho think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy
p161
aVare in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.
p162
aVAnd these Muslims \u2014 and it's the vast majority of Muslims \u2014
p163
aVdisagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.
p164
aVAnd they furthermore think overwhelmingly \u2014
p165
aVagain one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,
p166
aVand one can find this by reading any of the sources
p167
aVthat they have produced, and they're all over the Internet
p168
aVand in all sorts of languages \u2014 one can see that they're saying
p169
aVthat their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves
p170
aVto have choice in the spheres of personal life,
p171
aVin the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,
p172
aVand, yes, in the sphere of religion,
p173
aVwhich is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd many of these Muslims further say
p176
aVthat their disagreement with the United States
p177
aVis that it, in the past and still in the present,
p178
aVhas sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world
p179
aVin order to promote America's short-term interests.
p180
aVNow, during the Cold War, that may have been
p181
aVa defensible position for the United States to take.
p182
aVThat's an academic question.
p183
aVIt may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,
p184
aVand it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.
p185
aVAnd it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,
p186
aVand as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.
p187
aVBut now that the Cold War is over,
p188
aVthere's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world \u2014
p189
aVand pretty close to the same here in the United States,
p190
aVif you talk to people and ask them \u2014
p191
aVthat in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.
p192
aVAnd we see this among activist, practical Muslims,
p193
aVlike the Muslims who are presently the elected,
p194
aVparliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,
p195
aVwho are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,
p196
aVwho are promoting their own religious values,
p197
aVwho are elected by their own people
p198
aVbecause they were perceived as honest and sincere
p199
aVbecause of their religious values,
p200
aVbut who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance
p201
aVare fundamentally incompatible.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam
p204
aVconvinces us that it can't possibly be compatible
p205
aVwith what we consider the core of democracy \u2014
p206
aVnamely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.
p207
aVBut I'm here to tell you that technologies
p208
aVare more malleable than that.
p209
aVI'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe \u2014
p210
aVthe vast majority, in fact \u2014 in fact I think I would go so far as to say
p211
aVthat many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,
p212
aVnamely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty
p213
aVand basic human equality before God,
p214
aVare themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.
p215
aVAnd there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.
p216
aVAnd they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.
p217
aVBut their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.
p218
aVAnd for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt
p221
aVtry to form a party known as the Center Party,
p222
aVwhich advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.
p223
aVThey weren't even allowed to form a party.
p224
aVThey were actually blocked from even forming a party
p225
aVunder the political system there. Why?
p226
aVBecause they would have done extraordinarily well.
p227
aVIn the most recent elections in the Muslim world \u2014
p228
aVwhich are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco
p229
aVand those in Turkey \u2014 in each case,
p230
aVpeople who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats
p231
aVwere far and away the most successful vote-getters
p232
aVevery place they were allowed to run freely.
p233
aVSo in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race
p234
aVbut they were only allowed to contest half the seats.
p235
aVSo had they contested a larger number of the seats,
p236
aVthey would have done even better.
p237
aVNow what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case
p238
aVis that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.
p239
aVAnd that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims \u2014
p240
aVwho care very, very deeply about their traditions,
p241
aVwho do not want to compromise those values \u2014
p242
aVbelieve, through the malleability of the technology of democracy
p243
aVand the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,
p244
aVthat these two ideas can work together.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow what would that look like?
p247
aVWhat does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?
p248
aVWell, one thing is, it's not going to look identical
p249
aVto democracy as we know it in the United States.
p250
aVThat may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today \u2014
p251
aVfor example, in the regulatory context \u2014 of what democracy produces.
p252
aVIt will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,
p253
aVor Muslims out in the rest of the world \u2014
p254
aVI don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are \u2014
p255
aVconceptualize Islam.
p256
aVIt will be transformative of Islam as well.
p257
aVAnd as a result of this convergence,
p258
aVthis synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,
p259
aVthere's a real possibility that, instead of a clash
p260
aVof Islamic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014
p261
aVand democratic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014
p262
aVwe'll in fact have close compatibility.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,
p265
aVand you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war
p266
aVif you're talking about these issues.
p267
aVThe war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing
p268
aVbecause it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,
p269
aVmany Muslims will conclude that the United States
p270
aVis not the kind of place that they want to emulate
p271
aVwith respect to its forms of political government.
p272
aVOn the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,
p273
aVswept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think
p274
aVthat Islam is the enemy somehow \u2014
p275
aVthat Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.
p276
aVAnd even though, for political tactical reasons,
p277
aVthe president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,
p278
aVnonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war
p279
aVto think of the other side as an enemy.
p280
aVAnd one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,
p281
aVin defining who that enemy is.
p282
aVSo the risks are very great.
p283
aa(lp284
VOn the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war
p285
aVare also not to be underestimated,
p286
aVeven by, and I would say especially by, people
p287
aVwho are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.
p288
aVThose who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,
p289
aVit cannot be the right strategy,
p290
aVeither pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,
p291
aV"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,
p292
aVbecause we opposed the war in the first place."
p293
aVThat's not the way human circumstances operate.
p294
aVYou face the circumstances you have in front of you
p295
aVand you go forward.
p296
aa(lp297
VWell, what I'm here to say then is,
p298
aVfor people who are skeptical about the war,
p299
aVit's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war
p300
aVthere is a possibility for the government of the United States
p301
aVand the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts
p302
aVto create real forms of government that are truly democratic
p303
aVand also truly Islamic.
p304
aVAnd it is crucial \u2014 it is crucial in a practical, activist way \u2014
p305
aVfor people who care about these issues to make sure
p306
aVthat within the technology of democracy, in this system,
p307
aVthey exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices
p308
aVto encourage that outcome.
p309
aVThat's a hopeful message,
p310
aVbut it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it
p311
aVas incurring serious obligation for all of us.
p312
aVAnd I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,
p313
aVbut only if we put what we can into it.
p314
aVAnd if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.
p315
