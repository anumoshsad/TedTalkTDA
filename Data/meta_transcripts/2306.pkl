VThere's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love.
p4
aVHe says, "Don't hate the media. Be the media."
p5
aVI'm an artist.
p6
aVI like working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them
p7
aVand I like the power they hold.
p8
aVAnd B, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold.
p9

aa(lp12
VI remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow
p13
aVand then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.
p14
aVThey were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq,
p15
aVand Rumsfeld is asked the question,
p16
aV"Well, we're hear about our body counts,
p17
aVbut we never hear about theirs, why?"
p18
aVAnd Rumsfeld's answer is,
p19
aV"Well, we don't do body counts on other people."
p20
aVRight?
p21
aa(lp22
VIt's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians,
p23
aVhave died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003.
p24
aVThat number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died
p25
aVduring that same window of time.
p26
aVI wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number.
p27
aVI wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians
p28
aVwho died as a result of the invasion.
p29
aa(lp30
VMonuments to war, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial,
p31
aVare often enormous in scale.
p32
aVVery powerful and very one-sided.
p33
aVI wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate.
p34
aVI remember when I was a boy in school,
p35
aVmy teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment
p36
aVwhere you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government.
p37
aVAnd we were told, if we wrote a really good letter,
p38
aVif we really thought about it,
p39
aVwe would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is my "Notepad."
p42
aVWhat looks like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper
p43
aVis actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians
p44
aVthat died as a result of the US invasion.
p45
aV"Notepad" is an act of protest and an act of commemoration
p46
aVdisguised as an everyday tablet of paper.
p47
aVThe lines of the paper, when magnified,
p48
aVare revealed to be micro-printed text
p49
aVthat contains the details, the names, the dates and locations
p50
aVof individual Iraqi civilians that died.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, for the last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff,
p53
aVand smuggling it into the stationery supplies
p54
aVof the United States and the Coalition governments.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VI don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members
p65
aVof the so-called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them,
p68
aVand I share the project with them.
p69
aVAnd last summer, I had the chance to meet
p70
aVwith former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Video) Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you?
p73
aVThis is a special legal tablet.
p74
aVIt's actually part of an ongoing art project.
p75
aa(lp76
VAlberto Gonzalez: This is a special legal pad?
p77
aa(lp78
VMK: Yes. You won't believe me,
p79
aVbut it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art; I'm an artist.
p80
aa(lp81
VMK: And all of the lines of the paper are actually \u2014
p82
aa(lp83
VAG: Are they going to disappear?
p84
aa(lp85
VMK: No, they're micro-printed text
p86
aVthat contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians
p87
aVwho have died since the invasion of Iraq.
p88
aa(lp89
VAG: Yeah. OK.
p90
aa(lp91
VAG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VThe way he says "thank you" really creeps me out.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VOK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs.
p100
aVThere's an envelope.
p101
aVAnd please open it.
p102
aVThe paper you're holding in your hand
p103
aVcontains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion.
p104
aVI'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government.
p105
aVYou can help to smuggle this civilian body count
p106
aVinto government archives.
p107
aVBecause every letter that's sent in to the government,
p108
aVand this is all across the world, of course \u2014
p109
aVevery letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded.
p110
aVTogether, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power.
p111
aVEverything that's sent in
p112
aVeventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government,
p113
aVour shared historical record.
p114
aa(lp115
VThank you.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VTom Rielly: So, tell me Matt,
p120
aVhow did this idea come into your head, of "Notepad"?
p121
aa(lp122
VMatt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project
p123
aVthat dealt with the US Coalition side of the war
p124
aVand it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device"
p125
aVwhich accumulated, in real time,
p126
aVthe names, ranks, cause of death and location
p127
aVof US service members who had died overseas,
p128
aVand each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data,
p129
aVit would stab me in the arm.
p130
aVAnd so, I became aware that there was a spectacle
p131
aVassociated with our own people who were dying overseas,
p132
aVbut a disproportionate amount of casualties
p133
aVwere the civilian casualties.
p134
aa(lp135
VTR: Thank you so much.
p136

VMK: Thank you.
