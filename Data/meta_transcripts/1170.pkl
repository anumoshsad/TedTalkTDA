VI'm here today
p4
aVto start a revolution.
p5
aVNow before you get up in arms,
p6
aVor you break into song,
p7
aVor you pick a favorite color,
p8
aVI want to define what I mean by revolution.
p9
aVBy revolution,
p10
aVI mean a drastic and far-reaching change
p11
aVin the way we think and behave \u2014
p12
aVthe way we think and the way we behave.
p13
aVNow why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?
p14
aVWe need a revolution
p15
aVbecause things aren't working; they're just not working.
p16
aVAnd that makes me really sad
p17
aVbecause I'm sick and tired of things not working.
p18
aVYou know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.
p19
aVI'm sick and tired of us being last.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd we are last place in so many things \u2014
p22
aVfor example, social factors.
p23
aVWe're last place in Europe in innovation.
p24
aVThere we are right at the end, right at the bottom,
p25
aVlast place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.
p26
aVWe're last place in health care,
p27
aVand that's important for a sense of well-being.
p28
aVAnd there we are, not just last in the E.U.,
p29
aVwe're last in Europe, at the very bottom.
p30
aVAnd worst of all,
p31
aVit just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.
p32
aVWe're the saddest place on Earth,
p33
aVrelative to GDP per capita \u2014
p34
aVthe saddest place on Earth.
p35
aVThat's social. Let's look at education.
p36
aVWhere do we rank three weeks ago
p37
aVin another report by the OECD?
p38
aVLast in reading, math and science. Last.
p39
aVBusiness:
p40
aVThe lowest perception in the E.U.
p41
aVthat entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.
p42
aVWhy as a result, what happens?
p43
aVThe lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.
p44
aVAnd this is despite the fact
p45
aVthat everybody knows that small business
p46
aVis the engine of economies.
p47
aVWe hire the most people; we create the most taxes.
p48
aVSo if our engine's broken, guess what?
p49
aVLast in Europe GDP per capita.
p50
aVLast.
p51
aVSo it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians
p52
aVare not optimistic about the future.
p53
aVWe're unhappy, we have bad education,
p54
aVand we have the worst businesses.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd these are facts, guys.
p57
aVThis isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.
p58
aVIt's not.
p59
aVIt's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.
p60
aVSo I think it should be really, really clear
p61
aVthat our system is broken.
p62
aVThe way we think, the way we behave,
p63
aVour operating system of behaving is broken.
p64
aVWe need a drastic change in the way we think and behave
p65
aVto transform Bulgaria for the better,
p66
aVfor ourselves, for our friends,
p67
aVfor our family and for our future.
p68
aVHow did this happen?
p69
aVLet's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?
p70
aVI think we're last because \u2014
p71
aVand this is going to be drastic to some of you \u2014
p72
aVbecause we are handicapping ourselves.
p73
aVWe're holding ourselves back
p74
aVbecause we don't value play.
p75
aVI said "play," all right.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.
p78
aVBabies play, kids play,
p79
aVadults play.
p80
aVWe don't value play.
p81
aVIn fact, we devalue play.
p82
aVAnd we devalue it in three areas.
p83
aVLet's go back to the same three areas.
p84
aVSocial: 45 years of what?
p85
aVOf communism \u2014
p86
aVof valuing the society and the state over the individual
p87
aVand squashing, inadvertently,
p88
aVcreativity, individual self-expression and innovation.
p89
aVAnd instead, what do we value?
p90
aVBecause it's shown
p91
aVthe way we apply, generate and use knowledge
p92
aVis affected by our social and institutional context,
p93
aVwhich told us what in communism?
p94
aVTo be serious.
p95
aVTo be really, really serious.
p96
aVIt did.
p97
aV(Applause)
p98
aVBe serious.
p99
aVI can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park
p100
aVfor letting my kids play on the ground.
p101
aVHeaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,
p102
aVor even worse, lokvi, water \u2014 that will kill them.
p103
aVI have been told by babas and dyados
p104
aVthat we shouldn't let our kids play so much
p105
aVbecause life is serious
p106
aVand we need to train them for the seriousness of life.
p107
aa(lp108
VWe have a serious meme running through.
p109
aVIt's a social gene running through us.
p110
aVIt's a serious gene.
p111
aVIt's 45 years of it
p112
aVthat's created what I call the "baba factor."
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aVAnd here's how it works.
p116
aVStep one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."
p117
aVStep two: we get the baby. Woohoo!
p118
aVBut then what happens in step three?
p119
aVI want to go back to work
p120
aVbecause I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.
p121
aVI'm going to give bebko to baba.
p122
aVBut we need to remember
p123
aVthat baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.
p124
aVSo what happens?
p125
aVShe passes that virus on to baby,
p126
aVand it takes a really, really, really long time \u2014 as the redwood trees \u2014
p127
aVfor that serious meme
p128
aVto get out of our operating system.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat happens then?
p131
aVIt goes into education where we have an antiquated education system
p132
aVthat has little changed for 100 years,
p133
aVthat values rote learning,
p134
aVmemorization and standardization,
p135
aVand devalues self-expression, self-exploration,
p136
aVquestioning, creativity and play.
p137
aVIt's a crap system.
p138
aVTrue story: I went looking for a school for my kid.
p139
aVWe went to this prestigious little school
p140
aVand they say they're going to study math 10 times a week
p141
aVand science eight times a week
p142
aVand reading five times a day and all this stuff.
p143
aVAnd we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
p144
aVAnd they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVAnd we said, "He's five."
p147
aVWhat a crime. What a crime.
p148
aVAnd it's a crime
p149
aVthat our education system is so serious because education is serious
p150
aVthat we're creating mindless, robotic workers
p151
aVto put bolts in pre-drilled holes.
p152
aVBut I'm sorry, the problems of today
p153
aVare not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.
p154
aVWe need adaptability,
p155
aVthe ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.
p156
aVWe don't need mechanized workers.
p157
aVBut no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.
p158
aVWe create robotic workers that we treat like assets,
p159
aVto lever and just throw away.
p160
aa(lp161
VWhat are qualities of a Bulgarian work?
p162
aVAutocratic \u2014
p163
aVdo what I say because I'm the chef.
p164
aVI'm the boss and I know better than you.
p165
aVUntrusting \u2014 you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVControlling \u2014
p168
aVyou're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make
p169
aVa zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.
p170
aVSo they're restrictive \u2014 don't use your mobile phone,
p171
aVdon't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,
p172
aVdon't be on I.M.
p173
aVThat's somehow unprofessional and bad.
p174
aVAnd at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling
p175
aVbecause you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued
p176
aVand you're not having any fun.
p177
aVIn social, in education and in our business,
p178
aVdon't value play.
p179
aVAnd that's why we're last,
p180
aVbecause we don't value play.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.
p183
aVIt can't be because of play.
p184
aVJust play, that's a stupid thing."
p185
aVWe have the serious meme in us.
p186
aVWell I'm going to say no.
p187
aVAnd I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech \u2014
p188
aVthat play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,
p189
aVthat we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.
p190
aVPlay:
p191
aVour brains
p192
aVare hardwired for play.
p193
aVEvolution has selected,
p194
aVover millions and billions of years,
p195
aVfor play in animals and in humans.
p196
aVAnd you know what?
p197
aVEvolution does a really, really good job
p198
aVof deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us
p199
aVand selecting traits for competitive advantage.
p200
aVNature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.
p201
aVThroughout the animal kingdom, for example:
p202
aVants. Ants play.
p203
aVMaybe you didn't know that.
p204
aVBut when they're playing,
p205
aVthey're learning the social order and dynamics of things.
p206
aVRats play, but what you might not have known
p207
aVis that rats that play more
p208
aVhave bigger brains
p209
aVand they learn tasks better,
p210
aVskills.
p211
aVKittens play. We all know kittens play.
p212
aVBut what you may not know
p213
aVis that kittens deprived of play
p214
aVare unable to interact socially.
p215
aVThey can still hunt, but they can't be social.
p216
aVBears play.
p217
aVBut what you may not know
p218
aVis that bears that play more survive longer.
p219
aVIt's not the bears that learn how to fish better.
p220
aVIt's the ones that play more.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd a final really interesting study \u2014
p223
aVit's been shown, a correlation
p224
aVbetween play and brain size.
p225
aVThe more you play, the bigger the brains there are.
p226
aVDolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.
p227
aVBut who do you think
p228
aVwith the biggest brains are the biggest players?
p229
aVYours truly: humans.
p230
aVKids play, we play \u2014
p231
aVof every nationality, of every race,
p232
aVof every color, of every religion.
p233
aVIt's a universal thing \u2014 we play.
p234
aVAnd it's not just kids, it's adults too.
p235
aa(lp236
VReally cool term: neoteny \u2014
p237
aVthe retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.
p238
aVAnd who are the biggest neotenists?
p239
aVHumans. We play sports.
p240
aVWe do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.
p241
aVWe play musical instruments.
p242
aVWe dance, we kiss, we sing,
p243
aVwe just goof around.
p244
aVWe're designed by nature to play
p245
aVfrom birth to old age.
p246
aVWe're designed to do that continuously \u2014
p247
aVto play and play a lot
p248
aVand not stop playing.
p249
aVIt is a huge benefit.
p250
aVJust like there's benefits to animals,
p251
aVthere's benefits to humans.
p252
aVFor example, it's been shown
p253
aVto stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,
p254
aVin the area where it controls emotions.
p255
aVIt's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development
p256
aVwhere a lot of cognition is happening.
p257
aVAs a result, what happens?
p258
aVWe develop more emotional maturity if we play more.
p259
aVWe develop better decision-making ability
p260
aVif we play more.
p261
aa(lp262
VThese guys are facts.
p263
aVIt's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;
p264
aVit's cold, hard science.
p265
aVThese are the benefits to play.
p266
aVIt is a genetic birthright that we have,
p267
aVlike walking or speaking or seeing.
p268
aVAnd if we handicap ourselves with play,
p269
aVwe handicap ourselves
p270
aVas if we would with any other birthright that we have.
p271
aVWe hold ourselves back.
p272
aVLittle exercise just for a second:
p273
aVclose your eyes
p274
aVand try to imagine a world without play.
p275
aVImagine a world without theater, without the arts,
p276
aVwithout song, without dancing,
p277
aVwithout soccer, without football,
p278
aVwithout laughter.
p279
aVWhat does this world look like?
p280
aVIt's pretty bleak.
p281
aVIt's pretty glum.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow imagine your workplace.
p284
aVIs it fun? Is it playful?
p285
aVOr maybe the workplace of your friends \u2014 here we're forward thinking.
p286
aVIs it fun? Is it playful?
p287
aVOr is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,
p288
aVrestrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?
p289
aVWe have this concept
p290
aVthat the opposite of play is work.
p291
aVWe even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.
p292
aV"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"
p293
aVor, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.
p294
aVHe's going to think I'm not working hard."
p295
aVBut I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe opposite of play
p298
aVis not work.
p299
aVThe opposite of play
p300
aVis depression. It's depression.
p301
aVIn fact,
p302
aVplay improves our work.
p303
aVJust like there's benefits for humans and animals,
p304
aVthere's benefits for play at work.
p305
aVFor example, it stimulates creativity.
p306
aVIt increases our openness to change.
p307
aVIt improves our ability to learn.
p308
aVIt provides a sense of purpose and mastery \u2014
p309
aVtwo key motivational things
p310
aVthat increase productivity,
p311
aVthrough play.
p312
aVSo before you start thinking of play as just not serious,
p313
aVplay doesn't mean frivolous.
p314
aVYou know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,
p315
aVhe's serious about it, but he loves it.
p316
aVHe's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.
p317
aVA doctor might be serious,
p318
aVbut laughter's still a great medicine.
p319
aVOur thinking is backwards.
p320
aVWe shouldn't be feeling guilty.
p321
aVWe should be celebrating play.
p322
aa(lp323
VQuick example from the corporate world.
p324
aVFedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.
p325
aVIf you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,
p326
aVthey're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.
p327
aVWhat happens? They give better service \u2014
p328
aVnot worse, but better.
p329
aVAnd when customers call for service
p330
aVand they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,
p331
aVhow do the customers feel? They feel great.
p332
aVAnd what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?
p333
aVThey buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,
p334
aVwhich leads to more profit.
p335
aVPeople, service, profit.
p336
aVPlay increases productivity, not decreases.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd you're going to say,
p339
aV"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,
p340
aVbut it can't work in Bulgaria.
p341
aVNo way. We're different."
p342
aVIt does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
p343
aVOne, play is universal.
p344
aVThere's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,
p345
aVbesides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
p346
aVTwo, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
p347
aVWhen I got there, we had zero happy customers.
p348
aVNot one customer would refer us.
p349
aVI asked them all.
p350
aVWe had marginal profit \u2014 I did.
p351
aVWe had marginal profits,
p352
aVand we had unhappy stakeholders.
p353
aVThrough some basic change,
p354
aVchange like improving transparency,
p355
aVchange like promoting self-direction
p356
aVand collaboration, encouraging collaboration,
p357
aVnot autocracy,
p358
aVthe things like having a results-focus.
p359
aVI don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.
p360
aVI care that your customer and your team is happy
p361
aVand you're organized with that.
p362
aVWhy do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?
p363
aVBasically promoting fun.
p364
aVThrough promoting fun and a great environment,
p365
aVwe were able to transform Sciant
p366
aVand, in just three short years \u2014
p367
aVsounds like a long time, but change is slow \u2014
p368
aVevery customer, from zero to every customer referring us,
p369
aVabove average profits for the industry
p370
aVand happy stakeholders.
p371
aVAnd you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"
p372
aVWell we did win, every year that we entered,
p373
aVone of the rankings for best employer for small business.
p374
aVIndependent analysis from anonymous employees
p375
aVon their surveys.
p376
aVIt does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.
p377
aVThere's nothing holding us back,
p378
aVexcept our own mentality about play.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo some steps that we can take \u2014 to finish up \u2014
p381
aVhow to make this revolution through play.
p382
aVFirst of all, you have to believe me.
p383
aVIf you don't believe me,
p384
aVwell just go home and think about it some more or something.
p385
aVSecond of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,
p386
aVyou need to rediscover play.
p387
aVWhatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,
p388
aVthat you enjoyed only six months ago,
p389
aVbut now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,
p390
aVbecause you feel like you have to be serious,
p391
aVrediscover it.
p392
aVI don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.
p393
aVRediscover that
p394
aVbecause you're the leaders,
p395
aVthe innovation leaders, the thought leaders.
p396
aVYou're the ones that have to go back to the office
p397
aVor talk to your friends
p398
aVand ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
p399
aVYou guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,
p400
aVyour colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.
p401
aVYou've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."
p402
aVWeird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.
p403
aVI'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,
p404
aVand I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.
p405
aVI'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
p406
aVI'm going to let you challenge authority.
p407
aVBecause it's by challenging the way things are always done
p408
aVis that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in
p409
aVand create innovative solutions
p410
aVto problems of today.
p411
aa(lp412
VWe're not always right as leaders.
p413
aVWe're going to eradicate fear.
p414
aVFear is the enemy of play.
p415
aVAnd we're going to do things
p416
aVlike eliminate restrictions.
p417
aVYou know what, let them use their mobile phone
p418
aVfor personal calls \u2014 heaven forbid.
p419
aVLet them be on the Internet.
p420
aVLet them be on instant messengers.
p421
aVLet them take long lunches.
p422
aVLunch is like the recess for work.
p423
aVIt's when you go out in the world
p424
aVand you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,
p425
aVyou have a beer, you have some food, you talk,
p426
aVyou get some synergy of ideas
p427
aVthat maybe you wouldn't have had before.
p428
aVLet them do it. Give them some freedom,
p429
aVand in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.
p430
aVWe spend so much of our lives at the workplace,
p431
aVand it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,
p432
aVso that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?
p433
aVIs that all there was?"
p434
aVUnacceptable. Nepriemliv.
p435
aV(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VSo in summary,
p438
aVwe need a drastic change
p439
aVin the way we think and behave,
p440
aVbut we don't need
p441
aVa workers' revolution.
p442
aVWe don't need a workers' revolution.
p443
aVWhat we need
p444
aVis a players' uprising.
p445
aVWhat we need is a players' uprising.
p446
aVWhat we need is a players' uprising.
p447
