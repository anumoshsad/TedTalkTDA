VHello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,
p4
aVI've decided to bring along an old friend
p5
aVto help break the ice a bit.
p6
aVYes. That's right. This is Barbie.
p7
aVShe's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBut I'd also like to introduce you to
p10
aVwhat may be an unfamiliar face.
p11
aVThis is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,
p14
aVBarbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.
p15
aVThey have different interests. They have divergent values.
p16
aVAnd should they ever come in contact ...
p17
aVwell, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.
p18
aa(lp19
VMy experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.
p20
aVWhere I work, in the Arab region,
p21
aVpeople are busy taking up Western innovations
p22
aVand changing them into things
p23
aVwhich are neither conventionally Western,
p24
aVnor are they traditionally Islamic.
p25
aVI want to show you two examples.
p26
aVThe first is 4Shbab.
p27
aVIt means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Video): Video clips from across the globe.
p30
aVThe USA.

V\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b
p33
aa(lp34
V\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side \u266b
p35
aa(lp36
V\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b
p37
aa(lp38
V\u266b Everything will be all right \u266b
p39
aa(lp40
V\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b
p41
aa(lp42
VThe Arab world.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Music)
p45
aa(lp46
V\u266b She was preserved by modesty of the religion \u266b
p47
aV\u266b She was adorned by the light of the Quran \u266b

aa(lp49
VShereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.
p50
aVIts creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer
p51
aVcalled Ahmed Abu Haïba,
p52
aVwants young people to be inspired
p53
aVby Islam to lead better lives.
p54
aVHe reckons the best way to get that message across
p55
aVis to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.
p56
aV4Shbab was set up as an alternative
p57
aVto existing Arab music channels.
p58
aVAnd they look something like this.
p59
aV(Music)
p60
aa(lp61
VThat, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star
p62
aVand pan-Arab pin-up girl.
p63
aVIn the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.
p64
aVBut it's not about fire and brimstone either.
p65
aVIts videos are intended to show
p66
aVa kinder, gentler face of Islam,
p67
aVfor young people to deal with life's challenges.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.
p70
aVAnd it's called "The 99."
p71
aVNow, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.
p72
aVThey were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist
p73
aVcalled Naif Al Mutawa.
p74
aVAnd his desire is to rescue Islam
p75
aVfrom images of intolerance,
p76
aVall in a child-friendly format.
p77
aV"The 99." The characters are meant to embody
p78
aVthe 99 attributes of Allah:
p79
aVjustice, wisdom, mercy, among others.
p80
aVSo, for example, there is the character of Noora.
p81
aVShe is meant to have the power
p82
aVto look inside people
p83
aVand see the good and bad in everyone.
p84
aVAnother character called Jami
p85
aVhas the ability to create fantastic inventions.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, "The 99" is not just a comic book.
p88
aVIt's now a theme park.
p89
aVThere is an animated series in the works.
p90
aVAnd by this time next year,
p91
aVthe likes of Superman and Wonder Woman
p92
aVwill have joined forces with "The 99"
p93
aVto beat injustice wherever they find it.
p94
aa(lp95
V"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples
p96
aVof this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.
p97
aVWe're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.
p98
aVNor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
p99
aVI like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,
p100
aVin which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,
p103
aVthere is actually a very long tradition of this.
p104
aVThroughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations
p105
aVboth ancient and modern.
p106
aVAfter all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:
p107
aV"We made you into nations and tribes
p108
aVso that you could learn from one another."
p109
aVAnd to my mind, those are pretty wise words,
p110
aVno matter what your creed. Thank you.
