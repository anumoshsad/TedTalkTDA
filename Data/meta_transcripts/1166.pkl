VI want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979
p4
aVon the exact same day, at the exact same moment,
p5
aVeach conceiving a baby, OK?
p6
aVSo two couples each conceiving one baby.
p7
aVNow I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,
p8
aVbecause if you do, you're not going to listen to me,
p9
aVso just imagine that for a moment.
p10
aVAnd in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case,
p11
aVthe sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,
p12
aVmeeting that X chromosome of the egg.
p13
aVAnd in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,
p14
aVmeeting the X chromosome of the egg.
p15
aVBoth are viable; both take off.
p16
aVWe'll come back to these people later.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I wear two hats in most of what I do.
p19
aVAs the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
p20
aVI'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case
p21
aVis the way that people have dealt with anatomy \u2014
p22
aVmeaning human bodies, animal bodies \u2014
p23
aVhow they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;
p24
aVhow have they thought about bodies.
p25
aVThe other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist,
p26
aVas a patient advocate \u2014
p27
aVor, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate \u2014
p28
aVfor people who are patients of doctors.
p29
aVIn that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types
p30
aVthat challenge social norms.
p31
aVSo some of what I've worked on, for example,
p32
aVis people who are conjoined twins \u2014
p33
aVtwo people within one body.
p34
aVSome of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism \u2014
p35
aVso people who are much shorter than typical.
p36
aVAnd a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex \u2014
p37
aVso people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
p38
aVAnd as a general term, we can use the term "intersex" for this.
p39
aa(lp40
VIntersex comes in a lot of different forms.
p41
aVI'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex
p42
aVthat isn't standard for male or female.
p43
aVSo in one instance,
p44
aVyou can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,
p45
aVand that SRY gene on the Y chromosome
p46
aVtells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,
p47
aVto become testes.
p48
aVSo in the fetal life, those testes are pumping out testosterone.
p49
aVBut because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,
p50
aVthe body doesn't react to the testosterone.
p51
aVAnd this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p52
aVSo lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
p53
aVAs a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.
p54
aVWhen the child is born, she looks like a girl.
p55
aVShe is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
p56
aVAnd it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts,
p57
aVbut she's not getting her period,
p58
aVthat somebody figures out something's up here.
p59
aVAnd they do some tests and figure out
p60
aVthat, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,
p61
aVshe has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow what's important to understand
p64
aVis you may think of this person as really being male,
p65
aVbut they're really not.
p66
aVFemales, like males,
p67
aVhave in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
p68
aVThey're in the back of our body.
p69
aVAnd the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.
p70
aVMost females like me \u2014 I believe myself to be a typical female \u2014
p71
aVI don't actually know my chromosomal make-up,
p72
aVbut I think I'm probably typical \u2014
p73
aVmost females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
p74
aVWe're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
p75
aVThe consequence is that somebody like me
p76
aVhas actually had a brain exposed to more androgens
p77
aVthan the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p78
aVSo sex is really complicated \u2014
p79
aVit's not just that intersex people
p80
aVare in the middle of all the sex spectrum \u2014
p81
aVin some ways, they can be all over the place.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnother example:
p84
aVa few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,
p85
aVwho was born a boy, raised a boy,
p86
aVhad a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,
p87
aVhad a life as a guy,
p88
aVand had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
p89
aVWhat he had was an extreme form
p90
aVof a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
p91
aVHe had XX chromosomes,
p92
aVand in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear
p93
aVthat it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
p94
aVAnd as a consequence, his genitals were masculinized,
p95
aVhis brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
p96
aVAnd he was born looking like a boy \u2014 nobody suspected anything.
p97
aVAnd it was only when he had reached the age of 19
p98
aVthat he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally,
p99
aVthat doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female, internally.
p100
aa(lp101
VOK, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
p102
aVSome people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis,
p103
aVwhich is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
p104
aVAnd we're not exactly sure why that happens.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo sex can come in lots of different varieties.
p107
aVThe reason that children with these kinds of bodies \u2014
p108
aVwhether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,
p109
aVor it's an intersex type \u2014
p110
aVare often "normalized" by surgeons
p111
aVis not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
p112
aVIn many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
p113
aVThe reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries
p114
aVis because they threaten our social categories.
p115
aVOur system has been based typically on the idea
p116
aVthat a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
p117
aVSo we have the concept that what it means to be a woman
p118
aVis to have a female identity;
p119
aVwhat it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy
p120
aVin terms of your history.
p121
aVAnd so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
p122
aVAnd when we're faced with a body
p123
aVthat actually presents us something quite different,
p124
aVit startles us in terms of those categorizations.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
p127
aVAnd our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
p128
aVYou can imagine how startling then it is
p129
aVwhen you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body.
p130
aVWhere I ran into the most heat from this most recently
p131
aVwas last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya,
p132
aVhad her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
p133
aVI had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,
p134
aV"Which is the test they're going to run
p135
aVthat will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?"
p136
aVAnd I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
p137
aa(lp138
VIn fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough
p139
aVthat we have to admit:
p140
aVNature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,
p141
aVor between male and intersex and female and intersex;
p142
aVwe actually draw that line on nature.
p143
aVSo what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes,
p144
aVthe more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories
p145
aVthat we thought of as stable anatomical categories,
p146
aVthat mapped very simply to stable identity categories
p147
aVare a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
p148
aVAnd it's not just in terms of sex.
p149
aVIt's also in terms of race,
p150
aVwhich turns out to be vastly more complicated
p151
aVthan our terminology has allowed.
p152
aa(lp153
VAs we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
p154
aVWe look, for example, about the fact
p155
aVthat we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
p156
aVWhat are we to make of the fact
p157
aVthat we differ from them only, really, by a few nucleotides?
p158
aVAnd as we get farther and farther with our science,
p159
aVwe get more and more into a discomforted zone,
p160
aVwhere we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had
p161
aVare probably overly simplistic.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
p164
aVOne of the places we're seeing it, for example,
p165
aVin our culture, in the United States today,
p166
aVis battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
p167
aVWe have difficult conversations
p168
aVabout at what point we decide a body becomes a human,
p169
aVsuch that it has a different right than a fetal life.
p170
aVWe have very difficult conversations nowadays \u2014
p171
aVprobably not out in the open as much as within medicine \u2014
p172
aVabout the question of when somebody's dead.
p173
aVIn the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much
p174
aVwith this question of when somebody was dead.
p175
aVAt most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,
p176
aVand if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
p177
aVIf it stopped twitching, you bury them.
p178
aVBut today, we have a situation
p179
aVwhere we want to take vital organs out of beings
p180
aVand give them to other beings.
p181
aVAnd as a consequence,
p182
aVwe have to struggle with this really difficult question
p183
aVabout who's dead,
p184
aVand this leads us to a really difficult situation
p185
aVwhere we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow you might think that all this breaking-down of categories
p188
aVwould make somebody like me really happy.
p189
aVI'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,
p190
aVbut I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
p191
aVUnderstanding that these categories
p192
aVare really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
p193
aVIt makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
p194
aVSo in order to tell you about that tension,
p195
aVI have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
p196
aVI know they were racists, I know they were sexist,
p197
aVbut they were great.
p198
aVI mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did,
p199
aVthat I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,
p200
aVand it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
p201
aVIt's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,
p204
aVthe original anatomical activists,
p205
aVand this is why.
p206
aVWhat they rejected was an anatomical concept
p207
aVand replaced it with another one
p208
aVthat was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
p209
aVSo as you all recall,
p210
aVwhat our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,
p211
aVand the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
p212
aVThe monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA,
p213
aVbut they did have a concept of birthright.
p214
aVThey had a concept of blue blood.
p215
aVThey had the idea that the people who would be in political power
p216
aVshould be in political power because of the blood being passed down
p217
aVfrom grandfather to father to son and so forth.
p218
aVThe Founding Fathers rejected that idea,
p219
aVand they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,
p220
aVand that concept was "all men are created equal."
p221
aVThey leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered
p222
aVwas the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy,
p223
aVand that was a really radical thing to do.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow they were doing it in part
p226
aVbecause they were part of an Enlightenment system
p227
aVwhere two things were growing up together.
p228
aVAnd that was democracy growing up,
p229
aVbut it was also science growing up at the same time.
p230
aVAnd it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,
p231
aVa lot of them were very interested in science,
p232
aVand they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
p233
aVThey were moving away from supernatural explanations,
p234
aVand they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,
p235
aVwhere it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
p236
aa(lp237
VThey were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
p238
aVAnd if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,
p239
aVthey talk about nature and nature's God.
p240
aVThey don't talk about God and God's nature.
p241
aVThey're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
p242
aVSo as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept
p243
aVthat was about anatomical commonality.
p244
aVAnd in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way
p245
aVthe Civil Rights Movement of the future.
p246
aVThey didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo what happened years afterwards?
p249
aVWhat happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote,
p250
aVtook the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality
p251
aVbeing more important than anatomical difference
p252
aVand said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries
p253
aVis not significant enough in terms of a difference
p254
aVto mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,
p255
aVthe right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc."
p256
aVAnd women successfully argued that.
p257
aVNext came the successful Civil Rights Movement,
p258
aVwhere we found people like Sojourner Truth
p259
aVtalking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
p260
aVWe find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights Movement
p261
aVsaying, "I am a man."
p262
aVAgain, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy
p263
aVover a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.
p264
aVWe see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
p265
aa(lp266
VThe problem is, of course,
p267
aVthat, as we begin to look at all that commonality,
p268
aVwe have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
p269
aVMind you, I want to maintain some divisions,
p270
aVanatomically, in our culture.
p271
aVFor example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
p272
aVI don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
p273
aVI don't want to say a five-year-old
p274
aVshould be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
p275
aVSo there are some anatomical divisions
p276
aVthat make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
p277
aVBut the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are
p278
aVand why do we retain them, and do they have meaning.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
p281
aVWe have two beings, both conceived
p282
aVin the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
p283
aVLet's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely,
p284
aVso she's born on June 1, 1980.
p285
aVHenry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980.
p286
aVSimply by virtue of the fact
p287
aVthat Mary was born prematurely three months,
p288
aVshe comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does \u2014
p289
aVthe right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
p290
aVHenry has to wait for all of that,
p291
aVnot because he's actually any different in age, biologically,
p292
aVexcept in terms of when he was born.
p293
aa(lp294
VWe find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
p295
aVHenry, by virtue of being assumed to be male \u2014
p296
aValthough I haven't told you that he's the XY one \u2014
p297
aVby virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted,
p298
aVwhich Mary does not need to worry about.
p299
aVMary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right
p300
aVthat Henry has in all the states,
p301
aVnamely, the right to marry.
p302
aVHenry can marry, in every state, a woman,
p303
aVbut Mary can only marry today in a few states, a woman.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo we have these anatomical categories that persist,
p306
aVthat are in many ways problematic and questionable.
p307
aVAnd the question to me becomes:
p308
aVWhat do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,
p309
aVthat we reach the point where we have to admit
p310
aVthat a democracy that's been based on anatomy
p311
aVmight start falling apart?
p312
aVI don't want to give up the science, but at the same time,
p313
aVit feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
p314
aVSo where do we go?
p315
aVIt seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude:
p316
aV"We have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere."
p317
aVBut a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man
p320
aVis to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,
p321
aVand what it means to marry a woman means you have a Y chromosome.
p322
aVIn practice they don't test people for their chromosomes.
p323
aVBut this is also very bizarre,
p324
aVbecause of the story I told you at the beginning
p325
aVabout androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p326
aa(lp327
VIf we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy,
p328
aVDr. Martin Luther King,
p329
aVhe offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
p330
aVHe says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,
p331
aVbut on the content of their character,"
p332
aVmoving beyond anatomy.
p333
aVAnd I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."
p334
aVBut in practice, how do you do it?
p335
aVHow do you judge people based on the content of character?
p336
aVI also want to point out
p337
aVthat I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,
p338
aVbecause, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know
p339
aVthat are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
p340
aVI also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know
p341
aVthat are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions
p342
aVabout sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo how do we operationalize the question of content of character?
p345
aVIt turns out to be really difficult.
p346
aVAnd part of me also wonders,
p347
aVwhat if content of character
p348
aVturns out to be something that's scannable in the future \u2014
p349
aVable to be seen with an fMRI?
p350
aVDo we really want to go there?
p351
aVI'm not sure where we go.
p352
aa(lp353
VWhat I do know is that it seems to be really important
p354
aVto think about the idea of the United States being in the lead
p355
aVof thinking about this issue of democracy.
p356
aVWe've done a really good job struggling with democracy,
p357
aVand I think we would do a good job in the future.
p358
aVWe don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,
p359
aVwhere a man who's sexually attracted to other men
p360
aVis liable to be murdered,
p361
aVunless he's willing to submit to a sex change,
p362
aVin which case he's allowed to live.
p363
aa(lp364
VWe don't have that kind of situation.
p365
aVI'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with \u2014
p366
aVa surgeon I talked to a few years ago
p367
aVwho had brought over a set of conjoined twins
p368
aVin order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
p369
aVBut when I was on the phone with him, asking why he'll do this surgery \u2014
p370
aVthis was a very high-risk surgery \u2014 his answer was that, in this other nation,
p371
aVthese children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
p372
aVMy response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum
p373
aVinstead of a separation surgery?"
p374
aVThe United States has offered tremendous possibility
p375
aVfor allowing people to be the way they are,
p376
aVwithout having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
p377
aVSo I think we have to be in the lead.
p378
aa(lp379
VWell, just to close, I want to suggest to you
p380
aVthat I've been talking a lot about the Fathers.
p381
aVAnd I want to think about the possibilities
p382
aVof what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,
p383
aVif we had more involved the mothers.
p384
aVAnd I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,
p385
aVand that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights
p386
aVthat can come from different kinds of anatomies,
p387
aVparticularly when we have people thinking in groups.
p388
aVFor years, because I've been interested in intersex,
p389
aVI've also been interested in sex-difference research.
p390
aVAnd one of the things that I've been interested in
p391
aVis looking at the differences between males and females
p392
aVin terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
p393
aVAnd what we know from cross-cultural studies
p394
aVis that females, on average \u2014
p395
aVnot everyone, but on average \u2014
p396
aVare more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations
p397
aVand to taking care of people
p398
aVwho are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
p399
aVAnd so if we think about that,
p400
aVwe have an interesting situation in hands.
p401
aa(lp402
VYears ago, when I was in graduate school,
p403
aVone of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism \u2014
p404
aVI considered myself a feminist, as I still do,
p405
aVasked a really strange question.
p406
aVHe said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."
p407
aVAnd I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
p408
aVFeminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,
p409
aVso there's nothing feminine about feminism."
p410
aVBut the more I thought about his question,
p411
aVthe more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
p412
aVThat is to say, there might be something, on average,
p413
aVdifferent about female brains from male brains
p414
aVthat makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships,
p415
aVand more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.

aa(lp417
VSo whereas the Fathers were extremely attentive
p418
aVto figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,
p419
aVit's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept,
p420
aVwhat we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect,
p421
aVbut how to care for each other.
p422
aVAnd maybe that's where we need to go in the future,
p423
aVwhen we take democracy beyond anatomy,
p424
aVis to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity,
p425
aVand think more about those relationships.
p426
aVSo that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,
p427
aVwe're thinking about what we do for each other.
