VSix thousand miles of road,
p4
aV600 miles of subway track,
p5
aV400 miles of bike lanes
p6
aVand a half a mile of tram track,
p7
aVif you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.
p8
aa(lp9
VThese are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City.
p10
aVThese are the statistics of our infrastructure.
p11
aVThey're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies.
p12
aVFor example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you
p13
aVhow many miles of road they maintain.
p14
aVThe MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are.
p15
aVMost city agencies give us statistics.
p16
aVThis is from a report this year
p17
aVfrom the Taxi and Limousine Commission,
p18
aVwhere we learn that there's about 13,500 taxis here in New York City.
p19
aVPretty interesting, right?
p20
aVBut did you ever think about where these numbers came from?
p21
aVBecause for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency
p22
aVhad to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know.
p23
aVHere's a number  that our citizens want to know.
p24
aVSo they go back to their raw data,
p25
aVthey count, they add, they calculate,
p26
aVand then they put out reports,
p27
aVand those reports will have numbers like this.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe problem is, how do they know all of our questions?
p30
aVWe have lots of questions.
p31
aVIn fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions
p32
aVthat we can ask about our city.
p33
aVThe agencies can never keep up.
p34
aVSo the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that,
p35
aVbecause in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called
p36
aVthe most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country.
p37
aVIn a lot of ways, he's right.
p38
aVIn the last two years,  the city has released 1,000 datasets
p39
aVon our open data portal,
p40
aVand it's pretty awesome.
p41
aVSo you go and look at data like this,
p42
aVand instead of just counting the number of cabs,
p43
aVwe can start to ask different questions.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I had a question.
p46
aVWhen's rush hour in New York City?
p47
aVIt can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly?
p48
aVAnd I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers,
p49
aVthese are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets
p50
aVrecording each and every ride they take.
p51
aVThere's data there, and I looked at that data,
p52
aVand I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day.
p53
aVYou can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning,
p54
aVspeed increases, and at that point, things turn around,
p55
aVand they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning,
p56
aVwhen they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour.
p57
aVThe average taxi is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city streets,
p58
aVand it turns out it stays that way
p59
aVfor the entire day.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVSo I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City.
p62
aVThere's just a rush day.
p63
aVMakes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons.
p64
aVIf you're a transportation planner, this might be pretty interesting to know.
p65
aVBut if you want to get somewhere quickly,
p66
aVyou now know to set your alarm for 4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
p67
aVNew York, right?
p68
aa(lp69
VBut there's a story behind this data.
p70
aVThis data wasn't just available, it turns out.
p71
aVIt actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request,
p72
aVor a FOIL Request.
p73
aVThis is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website.
p74
aVIn order to access this data, you need to go get this form,
p75
aVfill it out, and they will notify you,
p76
aVand a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that.
p77
aVChris went down, and they told him,
p78
aV"Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office,
p79
aVleave it here for five hours, we'll copy the data and you take it back."
p80
aVAnd that's where this data came from.
p81
aVNow, Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public,
p82
aVand so it ended up online for all to use, and that's where this graph came from.
p83
aVAnd the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders \u2014 really cool.
p84
aVBut the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives
p85
aVpicking up data from city agencies to make it public \u2014
p86
aVit was already kind of public, you could get to it,
p87
aVbut it was "public," it wasn't public.
p88
aVAnd we can do better than that as a city.
p89
aVWe don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request.
p92
aVHere is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City
p93
aVbased on cyclist accidents.
p94
aVSo the red areas are more dangerous.
p95
aVAnd what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan,
p96
aVespecially in the lower area of Manhattan, has more cyclist accidents.
p97
aVThat might make sense
p98
aVbecause there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there.
p99
aVBut there's other hotspots worth studying.
p100
aVThere's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.
p101
aVAnd this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero.
p102
aVThis is exactly what we're looking for.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut there's a story behind this data as well.
p105
aVThis data didn't just appear.
p106
aVHow many of you guys know this logo?
p107
aVYeah, I see some shakes.
p108
aVHave you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF
p109
aVand make sense of it?
p110
aVI see more shakes.
p111
aVMore of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF.
p114
aVIn fact, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF
p115
aVput out by our very own NYPD,
p116
aVand in order to access it, you would either have to copy and paste
p117
aVfor hundreds and hundreds of hours,
p118
aVor you could be John Krauss.
p119
aVJohn Krauss was like,
p120
aVI'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program.
p121
aVIt's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,
p122
aVand it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs.
p123
aVEvery day it would search; if it found a PDF, it would download it
p124
aVand then it would run some PDF-scraping program,
p125
aVand out would come the text,
p126
aVand it would go on the Internet, and then people could make maps like that.
p127
aVAnd the fact that the data's here, the fact that we have access to it \u2014
p128
aVEvery accident, by the way, is a row in this table.
p129
aVYou can imagine how many PDFs that is.
p130
aVThe fact that we have access to that is great,
p131
aVbut let's not release it in PDF form,
p132
aVbecause then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers.
p133
aVIt's not the best use of our citizens' time,
p134
aVand we as a city can do better than that.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, the good news is that the de Blasio administration
p137
aVactually recently released this data a few months ago,
p138
aVand so now we can actually have access to it,
p139
aVbut there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF.
p140
aVFor example, our crime data is still only available in PDF.
p141
aVAnd not just our crime data, our own city budget.
p142
aVOur city budget is only readable right now in PDF form.
p143
aVAnd it's not just us that can't analyze it \u2014
p144
aVour own legislators who vote for the budget
p145
aValso only get it in PDF.
p146
aVSo our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for.
p147
aVAnd I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs.
p150
aVThis is an example of a map I made,
p151
aVand this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City.
p152
aVNow, how do I measure dirty?
p153
aVWell, it's kind of a little weird,
p154
aVbut I looked at the level of fecal coliform,
p155
aVwhich is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways.
p156
aVThe larger the circle, the dirtier the water,
p157
aVso the large circles are dirty water, the small circles are cleaner.
p158
aVWhat you see is inland waterways.
p159
aVThis is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years.
p160
aVAnd inland waterways are, in general, dirtier.
p161
aVThat makes sense, right?
p162
aVAnd the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this.
p163
aVNumber one: Never swim in anything that ends in "creek" or "canal."
p164
aVBut number two: I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City,
p165
aVby this measure, one measure.
p166
aVIn Coney Island Creek, which is not the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.
p167
aVIt's on the other side.
p168
aVBut Coney Island Creek, 94 percent of samples taken over the last five years
p169
aVhave had fecal levels so high
p170
aVthat it would be against state law to swim in the water.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see
p173
aVboasted in a city report, right?
p174
aVIt's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov.
p175
aVYou're not going to see it there,
p176
aVbut the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome.
p177
aVBut once again, it wasn't super easy,
p178
aVbecause this data was not on the open data portal.
p179
aVIf you were to go to the open data portal,
p180
aVyou'd see just a snippet of it,  a year or a few months.
p181
aVIt was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website.
p182
aVAnd each one of these links is an Excel  sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
p183
aVEvery heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize.
p184
aVWhen you do you can make maps and that's great, but once again,
p185
aVwe can do better than that  as a city, we can normalize things.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd we're getting there, because there's this website that Socrata makes
p188
aVcalled the Open Data Portal NYC.
p189
aVThis is where 1,100 data sets  that don't suffer
p190
aVfrom the things I just told you live,
p191
aVand that number is growing, and that's great.
p192
aVYou can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
p193
aVWhatever you want, you can download the data that way.
p194
aVThe problem is, once you do,
p195
aVyou will find that each agency codes their addresses differently.
p196
aVSo one is street name,  intersection street,
p197
aVstreet, borough, address, building, building address.
p198
aVSo once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal,
p199
aVyou're spending time normalizing our address fields.
p200
aVAnd that's not the best use  of our citizens' time.
p201
aVWe can do better than that as a city.
p202
aVWe can standardize our addresses,
p203
aVand if we do,  we can get more maps like this.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is a map of fire hydrants in New York City,
p206
aVbut not just any fire hydrants.
p207
aVThese are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVSo I learned a few things from this map, and I really like this map.
p210
aVNumber one, just don't park on the Upper East Side.
p211
aVJust don't. It doesn't matter where you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.
p212
aVNumber two, I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City,
p213
aVand they're on the Lower East Side,
p214
aVand they were bringing in over 55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.
p215
aVAnd that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it,
p216
aVso I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant
p217
aVand then something called a curb extension,
p218
aVwhich is like a seven-foot space to walk on,
p219
aVand then a parking spot.
p220
aVAnd so these cars came along, and the hydrant \u2014
p221
aV"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"
p222
aVand there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them.
p223
aVThey would park there, and the NYPD disagreed with this designation
p224
aVand would ticket them.
p225
aVAnd it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket.
p226
aVThis is the Google  Street View car driving by
p227
aVfinding the same parking ticket.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I wrote about this on my blog, on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,
p230
aVand they said,
p231
aV"While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location,
p232
aVwe will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations."
p233
aVAnd I thought to myself, typical government response,
p234
aVall right, moved on with my life.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut then, a few weeks later, something incredible happened.
p237
aVThey repainted the spot,
p238
aVand for a second I thought I saw the future of open data,
p239
aVbecause think about what happened here.
p240
aVFor five years, this spot was being  ticketed, and it was confusing,
p241
aVand then a citizen found something, they told the city, and within a few weeks
p242
aVthe problem was fixed.
p243
aVIt's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog.
p244
aVIt's not, it's about being a partner.
p245
aVWe can empower our citizens to be better partners for government,
p246
aVand it's not that hard.
p247
aVAll we need are a few changes.
p248
aVIf you're FOILing data,
p249
aVif you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again,
p250
aVlet's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public.
p251
aVAnd if you're a government agency releasing a PDF,
p252
aVlet's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data,
p253
aVbecause that data is coming from somewhere.
p254
aVI don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere,
p255
aVand you can release it with the PDF.
p256
aVAnd let's adopt and share some open data standards.
p257
aVLet's start with our addresses here in New York City.
p258
aVLet's just start normalizing our addresses.
p259
aVBecause New York is a leader in open data.
p260
aVDespite all this, we are absolutely a leader in open data,
p261
aVand if we start normalizing things, and set an open data standard,
p262
aVothers will follow. The state will follow, and maybe the federal government,
p263
aVOther countries could follow,
p264
aVand we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program
p265
aVand map information from 100 countries.
p266
aVIt's not science fiction. We're actually quite close.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd by the way, who are we empowering with this?
p269
aVBecause it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong.
p270
aVThere are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now,
p271
aVactive meetups.
p272
aVThere are thousands of people attending these meetups.
p273
aVThese people are going after work and on weekends,
p274
aVand they're attending these meetups to look at open data
p275
aVand make our city a better place.
p276
aVGroups like BetaNYC, who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc
p277
aVthat allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints
p278
aVaround your own home, or around your office.
p279
aVYou put in your address, you get local complaints.
p280
aVAnd it's not just the tech community that are after these things.
p281
aVIt's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt.
p282
aVIt's policy advocates, it's everyone,
p283
aVit's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds.
p284
aVAnd with some small, incremental changes,
p285
aVwe can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens
p286
aVto harness open data and make our city even better,
p287
aVwhether it's one dataset, or one parking spot at a time.
p288
