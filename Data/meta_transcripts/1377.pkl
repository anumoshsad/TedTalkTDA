VWhen I was nine years old,
p4
aVI went off to summer camp for the first time.
p5
aVAnd my mother packed me a suitcase full of books,
p6
aVwhich to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.
p7
aVBecause in my family, reading was the primary group activity.
p8
aVAnd this might sound antisocial to you,
p9
aVbut for us it was really just a different way of being social.
p10
aVYou have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you,
p11
aVbut you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland
p12
aVinside your own mind.
p13
aVAnd I had this idea
p14
aVthat camp was going to be just like this, but better.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin
p19
aVcozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VCamp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.
p24
aVAnd on the very first day,
p25
aVour counselor gathered us all together
p26
aVand she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing
p27
aVevery day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
p28
aVAnd it went like this:
p29
aV"R-O-W-D-I-E,
p30
aVthat's the way we spell rowdie.
p31
aVRowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VYeah.
p36
aVSo I couldn't figure out for the life of me
p37
aVwhy we were supposed to be so rowdy,
p38
aVor why we had to spell this word incorrectly.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VBut I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.
p43
aVI did my best.
p44
aVAnd I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase,
p47
aVthe coolest girl in the bunk came up to me
p48
aVand she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" \u2014
p49
aVmellow, of course, being the exact opposite
p50
aVof R-O-W-D-I-E.
p51
aVAnd then the second time I tried it,
p52
aVthe counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face
p53
aVand she repeated the point about camp spirit
p54
aVand said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd so I put my books away,
p57
aVback in their suitcase,
p58
aVand I put them under my bed,
p59
aVand there they stayed for the rest of the summer.
p60
aVAnd I felt kind of guilty about this.
p61
aVI felt as if the books needed me somehow,
p62
aVand they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.
p63
aVBut I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again
p64
aVuntil I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, I tell you this story about summer camp.
p67
aVI could have told you 50 others just like it \u2014
p68
aVall the times that I got the message
p69
aVthat somehow my quiet and introverted style of being
p70
aVwas not necessarily the right way to go,
p71
aVthat I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.
p72
aVAnd I always sensed deep down that this was wrong
p73
aVand that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
p74
aVBut for years I denied this intuition,
p75
aVand so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things,
p76
aVinstead of the writer that I had always longed to be \u2014
p77
aVpartly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.
p78
aVAnd I was always going off to crowded bars
p79
aVwhen I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
p80
aVAnd I made these self-negating choices so reflexively,
p81
aVthat I wasn't even aware that I was making them.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow this is what many introverts do,
p84
aVand it's our loss for sure,
p85
aVbut it is also our colleagues' loss
p86
aVand our communities' loss.
p87
aVAnd at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.
p88
aVBecause when it comes to creativity and to leadership,
p89
aVwe need introverts doing what they do best.
p90
aVA third to a half of the population are introverts \u2014
p91
aVa third to a half.
p92
aVSo that's one out of every two or three people you know.
p93
aVSo even if you're an extrovert yourself,
p94
aVI'm talking about your coworkers
p95
aVand your spouses and your children
p96
aVand the person sitting next to you right now \u2014
p97
aVall of them subject to this bias
p98
aVthat is pretty deep and real in our society.
p99
aVWe all internalize it from a very early age
p100
aVwithout even having a language for what we're doing.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, to see the bias clearly,
p103
aVyou need to understand what introversion is.
p104
aVIt's different from being shy.
p105
aVShyness is about fear of social judgment.
p106
aVIntroversion is more about,
p107
aVhow do you respond to stimulation,
p108
aVincluding social stimulation.
p109
aVSo extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation,
p110
aVwhereas introverts feel at their most alive
p111
aVand their most switched-on and their most capable
p112
aVwhen they're in quieter, more low-key environments.
p113
aVNot all the time \u2014 these things aren't absolute \u2014
p114
aVbut a lot of the time.
p115
aVSo the key then to maximizing our talents
p116
aVis for us all to put ourselves
p117
aVin the zone of stimulation that is right for us.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut now here's where the bias comes in.
p120
aVOur most important institutions,
p121
aVour schools and our workplaces,
p122
aVthey are designed mostly for extroverts
p123
aVand for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.
p124
aVAnd also we have this belief system right now
p125
aVthat I call the new groupthink,
p126
aVwhich holds that all creativity and all productivity
p127
aVcomes from a very oddly gregarious place.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:
p130
aVWhen I was going to school, we sat in rows.
p131
aVWe sat in rows of desks like this,
p132
aVand we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
p133
aVBut nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks \u2014
p134
aVfour or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.
p135
aVAnd kids are working in countless group assignments.
p136
aVEven in subjects like math and creative writing,
p137
aVwhich you think would depend on solo flights of thought,
p138
aVkids are now expected to act as committee members.
p139
aVAnd for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone,
p140
aVthose kids are seen as outliers often
p141
aVor, worse, as problem cases.
p142
aVAnd the vast majority of teachers
p143
aVreports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert
p144
aVas opposed to an introvert,
p145
aVeven though introverts actually get better grades
p146
aVand are more knowledgeable,
p147
aVaccording to research.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VOkay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
p152
aVNow, most of us work in open plan offices,
p153
aVwithout walls,
p154
aVwhere we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.
p155
aVAnd when it comes to leadership,
p156
aVintroverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions,
p157
aVeven though introverts tend to be very careful,
p158
aVmuch less likely to take outsize risks \u2014
p159
aVwhich is something we might all favor nowadays.
p160
aVAnd interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School
p161
aVhas found that introverted leaders
p162
aVoften deliver better outcomes than extroverts do,
p163
aVbecause when they are managing proactive employees,
p164
aVthey're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas,
p165
aVwhereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly,
p166
aVget so excited about things
p167
aVthat they're putting their own stamp on things,
p168
aVand other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.
p171
aVI'll give you some examples.
p172
aVEleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi \u2014
p173
aVall these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
p174
aVAnd they all took the spotlight,
p175
aVeven though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.
p176
aVAnd this turns out to have a special power all its own,
p177
aVbecause people could feel that these leaders were at the helm
p178
aVnot because they enjoyed directing others
p179
aVand not out of the pleasure of being looked at;
p180
aVthey were there because they had no choice,
p181
aVbecause they were driven to do what they thought was right.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow I think at this point it's important for me to say
p184
aVthat I actually love extroverts.
p185
aVI always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts,
p186
aVincluding my beloved husband.
p187
aVAnd we all fall at different points, of course,
p188
aValong the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
p189
aVEven Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms,
p190
aVsaid that there's no such thing as a pure introvert
p191
aVor a pure extrovert.
p192
aVHe said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum,
p193
aVif he existed at all.
p194
aVAnd some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,
p195
aVand we call these people ambiverts.
p196
aVAnd I often think that they have the best of all worlds.
p197
aVBut many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance.
p200
aVWe need more of a yin and yang between these two types.
p201
aVThis is especially important
p202
aVwhen it comes to creativity and to productivity,
p203
aVbecause when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people,
p204
aVwhat they find
p205
aVare people who are very good at exchanging ideas
p206
aVand advancing ideas,
p207
aVbut who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd this is because solitude
p210
aVis a crucial ingredient often to creativity.
p211
aVSo Darwin,
p212
aVhe took long walks alone in the woods
p213
aVand emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations.
p214
aVTheodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,
p215
aVhe dreamed up many of his amazing creations
p216
aVin a lonely bell tower office that he had
p217
aVin the back of his house in La Jolla, California.
p218
aVAnd he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books
p219
aVfor fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure
p220
aVand would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.
p221
aVSteve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer
p222
aVsitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard
p223
aVwhere he was working at the time.
p224
aVAnd he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place
p225
aVhad he not been too introverted to leave the house
p226
aVwhen he was growing up.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, of course,
p229
aVthis does not mean that we should all stop collaborating \u2014
p230
aVand case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs
p231
aVto start Apple Computer \u2014
p232
aVbut it does mean that solitude matters
p233
aVand that for some people it is the air that they breathe.
p234
aVAnd in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.
p235
aVIt's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.
p236
aVIf you look at most of the world's major religions,
p237
aVyou will find seekers \u2014
p238
aVMoses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad \u2014
p239
aVseekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness,
p240
aVwhere they then have profound epiphanies and revelations
p241
aVthat they then bring back to the rest of the community.
p242
aVSo, no wilderness, no revelations.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis is no surprise, though,
p245
aVif you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.
p246
aVIt turns out that we can't even be in a group of people
p247
aVwithout instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.
p248
aVEven about seemingly personal and visceral things
p249
aVlike who you're attracted to,
p250
aVyou will start aping the beliefs of the people around you
p251
aVwithout even realizing that that's what you're doing.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd groups famously follow the opinions
p254
aVof the most dominant or charismatic person in the room,
p255
aVeven though there's zero correlation
p256
aVbetween being the best talker and having the best ideas \u2014
p257
aVI mean zero.
p258
aVSo \u2014
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VYou might be following the person with the best ideas,
p263
aVbut you might not.
p264
aVAnd do you really want to leave it up to chance?
p265
aVMuch better for everybody to go off by themselves,
p266
aVgenerate their own ideas
p267
aVfreed from the distortions of group dynamics,
p268
aVand then come together as a team
p269
aVto talk them through in a well-managed environment
p270
aVand take it from there.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow if all this is true,
p273
aVthen why are we getting it so wrong?
p274
aVWhy are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?
p275
aVAnd why are we making these introverts feel so guilty
p276
aVabout wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?
p277
aVOne answer lies deep in our cultural history.
p278
aVWestern societies,
p279
aVand in particular the U.S.,
p280
aVhave always favored the man of action over the "man" of contemplation.
p281
aVBut in America's early days,
p282
aVwe lived in what historians call a culture of character,
p283
aVwhere we still, at that point, valued people
p284
aVfor their inner selves and their moral rectitude.
p285
aVAnd if you look at the self-help books from this era,
p286
aVthey all had titles with things like
p287
aV"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."
p288
aVAnd they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln,
p289
aVwho was praised for being modest and unassuming.
p290
aVRalph Waldo Emerson called him
p291
aV"A man who does not offend by superiority."
p292
aa(lp293
VBut then we hit the 20th century,
p294
aVand we entered a new culture
p295
aVthat historians call the culture of personality.
p296
aVWhat happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy
p297
aVto a world of big business.
p298
aVAnd so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.
p299
aVAnd instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives,
p300
aVnow they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.
p301
aVSo, quite understandably,
p302
aVqualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.
p303
aVAnd sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs
p304
aVand they start to have names
p305
aVlike "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
p306
aVAnd they feature as their role models really great salesmen.
p307
aVSo that's the world we're living in today.
p308
aVThat's our cultural inheritance.
p309
aa(lp310
VNow none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant,
p311
aVand I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
p312
aVThe same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops
p313
aValso teach us love and trust.
p314
aVAnd the problems that we are facing today
p315
aVin fields like science and in economics
p316
aVare so vast and so complex
p317
aVthat we are going to need armies of people coming together
p318
aVto solve them working together.
p319
aVBut I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves,
p320
aVthe more likely that they are
p321
aVto come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
p324
aVGuess what?
p325
aVBooks.
p326
aVI have a suitcase full of books.
p327
aVHere's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."
p328
aVHere's a novel by Milan Kundera.
p329
aVAnd here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.
p330
aVBut these are not exactly my books.
p331
aVI brought these books with me
p332
aVbecause they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.
p333
aa(lp334
VMy grandfather was a rabbi
p335
aVand he was a widower
p336
aVwho lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn
p337
aVthat was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up,
p338
aVpartly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence
p339
aVand partly because it was filled with books.
p340
aVI mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment
p341
aVhad yielded its original function
p342
aVto now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.
p343
aVJust like the rest of my family,
p344
aVmy grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.
p345
aa(lp346
VBut he also loved his congregation,
p347
aVand you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave
p348
aVevery week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.
p349
aVHe would takes the fruits of each week's reading
p350
aVand he would weave
p351
aVthese intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.
p352
aVAnd people would come from all over to hear him speak.
p353
aa(lp354
VBut here's the thing about my grandfather.
p355
aVUnderneath this ceremonial role,
p356
aVhe was really modest and really introverted \u2014
p357
aVso much so that when he delivered these sermons,
p358
aVhe had trouble making eye contact
p359
aVwith the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
p360
aVAnd even away from the podium,
p361
aVwhen you called him to say hello,
p362
aVhe would often end the conversation prematurely
p363
aVfor fear that he was taking up too much of your time.
p364
aVBut when he died at the age of 94,
p365
aVthe police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood
p366
aVto accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.
p367
aVAnd so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example
p368
aVin my own way.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo I just published a book about introversion,
p371
aVand it took me about seven years to write.
p372
aVAnd for me, that seven years was like total bliss,
p373
aVbecause I was reading, I was writing,
p374
aVI was thinking, I was researching.
p375
aVIt was my version
p376
aVof my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.
p377
aVBut now all of a sudden my job is very different,
p378
aVand my job is to be out here talking about it,
p379
aVtalking about introversion.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd that's a lot harder for me,
p384
aVbecause as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now,
p385
aVthis is not my natural milieu.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo I prepared for moments like these as best I could.
p388
aVI spent the last year practicing public speaking
p389
aVevery chance I could get.
p390
aVAnd I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd that actually helped a lot.
p395
aVBut I'll tell you, what helps even more
p396
aVis my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes
p397
aVto introversion and to quiet and to solitude,
p398
aVwe truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.
p399
aVI mean, we are.
p400
aVAnd so I am going to leave you now
p401
aVwith three calls for action for those who share this vision.
p402
aa(lp403
VNumber one:
p404
aVStop the madness for constant group work.
p405
aVJust stop it.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VThank you.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Applause)
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd I want to be clear about what I'm saying,
p414
aVbecause I deeply believe our offices
p415
aVshould be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions \u2014
p416
aVyou know, the kind where people come together
p417
aVand serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.
p418
aVThat is great.
p419
aVIt's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.
p420
aVBut we need much more privacy and much more freedom
p421
aVand much more autonomy at work.
p422
aVSchool, same thing.
p423
aVWe need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure,
p424
aVbut we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.
p425
aVThis is especially important for extroverted children too.
p426
aVThey need to work on their own
p427
aVbecause that is where deep thought comes from in part.
p428
aa(lp429
VOkay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
p430
aVBe like Buddha, have your own revelations.
p431
aVI'm not saying
p432
aVthat we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods
p433
aVand never talk to each other again,
p434
aVbut I am saying that we could all stand to unplug
p435
aVand get inside our own heads a little more often.
p436
aa(lp437
VNumber three:
p438
aVTake a good look at what's inside your own suitcase
p439
aVand why you put it there.
p440
aVSo extroverts,
p441
aVmaybe your suitcases are also full of books.
p442
aVOr maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.
p443
aVWhatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get
p444
aVand grace us with your energy and your joy.
p445
aVBut introverts, you being you,
p446
aVyou probably have the impulse to guard very carefully
p447
aVwhat's inside your own suitcase.
p448
aVAnd that's okay.
p449
aVBut occasionally, just occasionally,
p450
aVI hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see,
p451
aVbecause the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.
