VSo I want to take you on a trip
p4
aVto an alien world.
p5
aVAnd it's not a trip
p6
aVthat requires light-years of travel,
p7
aVbut it's to a place
p8
aVwhere it's defined by light.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo it's a little-appreciated fact
p11
aVthat most of the animals in our ocean
p12
aVmake light.
p13
aVI've spent most of my career
p14
aVstudying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
p15
aVI study it because I think understanding it
p16
aVis critical to understanding life in the ocean
p17
aVwhere most bioluminescence occurs.
p18
aVI also use it as a tool
p19
aVfor visualizing and tracking pollution.
p20
aVBut mostly I'm entranced by it.
p21
aVSince my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,
p22
aVwhen I went down and turned out the lights
p23
aVand saw the fireworks displays,
p24
aVI've been a bioluminescence junky.
p25
aVBut I would come back from those dives
p26
aVand try to share the experience with words,
p27
aVand they were totally inadequate to the task.
p28
aVI needed some way to share the experience directly.
p29
aVAnd the first time I figured out that way
p30
aVwas in this little single-person submersible
p31
aVcalled Deep Rover.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis next video clip,
p34
aVyou're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.
p35
aVAnd the first thing you're going to see
p36
aVis a transect screen
p37
aVthat is about a meter across.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,
p40
aVa mess screen will come into contact
p41
aVwith the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.
p42
aVWith the sub's lights switched off,
p43
aVit is possible to see their bioluminescence \u2014
p44
aVthe light produced when they collide with the mesh.
p45
aVThis is the first time
p46
aVit has ever been recorded.
p47
aa(lp48
VEdith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera
p49
aVthat has about the sensitivity
p50
aVof the fully dark-adapted human eye.
p51
aVWhich means that really is what you would see
p52
aVif you took a dive in a submersible.
p53
aVBut just to try to prove that fact to you,
p54
aVI've brought along some bioluminescent plankton
p55
aVin what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt
p56
aVat a live demonstration.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo, if we could have the lights down
p61
aVand have it as dark in here as possible,
p62
aVI have a flask
p63
aVthat has bioluminescent plankton in it.
p64
aVAnd you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,
p65
aVeither because they're dead \u2014
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVor because I need to stir them up in some way
p68
aVfor you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Gasps)
p71
aa(lp72
VOops. Sorry.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VI spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.
p77
aVOkay.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo that light
p80
aVwas made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,
p81
aVa single-celled alga.
p82
aVSo why would a single-celled alga
p83
aVneed to be able to produce light?
p84
aVWell, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
p85
aVThe flash is like a scream for help.
p86
aVIt's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,
p87
aVand just like the alarm on your car or your house,
p88
aVit's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,
p89
aVthereby either leading to his capture
p90
aVor scaring him away.
p91
aa(lp92
VThere's a lot of animals that use this trick,
p93
aVfor example this black dragonfish.
p94
aVIt's got a light organ under its eye.
p95
aVIt's got a chin barbel.
p96
aVIt's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.
p97
aVSo we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,
p98
aVbecause the top speed of this fish is one knot,
p99
aVwhich was the top speed of the submersible.
p100
aVBut it was worth it,
p101
aVbecause we caught it in a special capture device,
p102
aVbrought it up into the lab on the ship,
p103
aVand then everything on this fish lights up.
p104
aVIt's unbelievable.
p105
aVThe light organs under the eyes are flashing.
p106
aVThat chin barbel is flashing.
p107
aVIt's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,
p108
aVfin lights.
p109
aVIt's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.
p110
aVIt's phenomenal.
p111
aVAnd you normally don't get to see this
p112
aVbecause we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.
p113
aa(lp114
VThere's other ways you can defend yourself with light.
p115
aVFor example, this shrimp
p116
aVreleases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water
p117
aVjust the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.
p118
aVThis blinds or distracts the predator.
p119
aVThis little squid is called the fire shooter
p120
aVbecause of its ability to do this.
p121
aVNow it may look like a tasty morsel,
p122
aVor a pig's head with wings \u2014
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVbut if it's attacked,
p125
aVit puts out a barrage of light \u2014
p126
aVin fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.
p127
aVI just barely got the lights out in time
p128
aVfor you to be able to see those gobs of light
p129
aVhitting the transect screen
p130
aVand then just glowing.
p131
aVIt's phenomenal.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo there's a lot of animals in the open ocean \u2014
p134
aVmost of them that make light.
p135
aVAnd we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
p136
aVThey use it for finding food, for attracting mates,
p137
aVfor defending against predators.
p138
aVBut when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,
p139
aVthat's where things get really strange.
p140
aVAnd some of these animals
p141
aVare probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,"
p142
aVbut you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.
p143
aVThey're things like this.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is a golden coral, a bush.
p146
aVIt grows very slowly.
p147
aVIn fact, it's thought that some of these
p148
aVare as much as 3,000 years old,
p149
aVwhich is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.
p150
aVThe other reason is this amazing bush glows.
p151
aVSo if you brush up against it,
p152
aVany place you brushed against it,
p153
aVyou get this twinkling blue-green light
p154
aVthat's just breathtaking.
p155
aVAnd you see things like this.
p156
aVThis looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book \u2014
p157
aVjust all manner of creatures all over this thing.
p158
aVAnd these are flytrap anemones.
p159
aVNow if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.
p160
aVBut if you keep poking it,
p161
aVit starts to produce light.
p162
aVAnd it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
p163
aVIt produces these strings of light,
p164
aVpresumably as some form of defense.
p165
aa(lp166
VThere are starfish that can make light.
p167
aVAnd there are brittle stars that produce bands of light
p168
aVthat dance along their arms.
p169
aVThis looks like a plant,
p170
aVbut it's actually an animal.
p171
aVAnd it anchors itself in the sand
p172
aVby blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.
p173
aVSo it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,
p174
aVas you see here.
p175
aVBut if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab
p176
aVand just squeeze it at the base of the stock,
p177
aVit produces this light
p178
aVthat propagates from stem to the plume,
p179
aVchanging color as it goes,
p180
aVfrom green to blue.
p181
aVColorization and sound effects
p182
aVadded for you viewing pleasure.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVBut we have no idea why it does that.
p185
aa(lp186
VHere's another one. This is also a sea pen.
p187
aVIt's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
p188
aVIt's a green saber of light.
p189
aVAnd like the one you just saw,
p190
aVit can produce these as bands of light.
p191
aVSo if I squeeze the base,
p192
aVthe bands go from base to tip.
p193
aVIf I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.
p194
aVSo what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?
p195
aV(Gasps)
p196
aVI'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VSo there's a language of light in the deep ocean,
p201
aVand we're just beginning to understand it,
p202
aVand one way we're going about that
p203
aVis we're imitating a lot of these displays.
p204
aVThis is an optical lure that I've used.
p205
aVWe call it the electronic jellyfish.
p206
aVIt's just 16 blue LEDs
p207
aVthat we can program to do different types of displays.
p208
aVAnd we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea
p209
aVthat uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,
p210
aVso it's unobtrusive.
p211
aVSo I just want to show you
p212
aVsome of the responses we've elicited
p213
aVfrom animals in the deep sea.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo the camera's black and white.
p216
aVIt's not high-resolution.
p217
aVAnd what you're seeing here is a bait box
p218
aVwith a bunch of \u2014 like the cockroaches of the ocean \u2014
p219
aVthere are isopods all over it.
p220
aVAnd right in the front
p221
aVis the electronic jellyfish.
p222
aVAnd when it starts flashing,
p223
aVit's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.
p224
aVBut as soon as it starts to flash \u2014
p225
aVand it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera \u2014
p226
aVI want you to look right here.
p227
aVThere's something small there that responds.
p228
aVWe're talking to something.
p229
aVIt looks like a little of string pearls basically \u2014
p230
aVin fact, three strings of pearls.
p231
aVAnd this was very consistent.
p232
aVThis was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.
p233
aVWe basically have a chat room going on here,
p234
aVbecause once it gets started, everybody's talking.
p235
aVAnd I think this is actually a shrimp
p236
aVthat's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.
p237
aVBut the cool thing is, we're talking to it.
p238
aVWe don't know what we're saying.
p239
aVPersonally, I think it's something sexy.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd then finally,
p244
aVI want to show you some responses that we recorded
p245
aVwith the world's first deep-sea webcam,
p246
aVwhich we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.
p247
aVWe've only just begun to analyze all of this data.
p248
aVThis is going to be a glowing source first,
p249
aVwhich is like bioluminescent bacteria.
p250
aVAnd it is an optical cue
p251
aVthat there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.
p252
aVSo this scavenger comes in,
p253
aVwhich is a giant sixgill shark.
p254
aVAnd I can't claim for sure
p255
aVthat the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
p256
aVBut if it had been following the odor plume,
p257
aVit would have come in from the other direction.
p258
aVAnd it does actually seem to be trying
p259
aVto eat the electronic jellyfish.
p260
aVThat's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.
p261
aa(lp262
VOkay, so this next one is from the webcam,
p263
aVand it's going to be this pinwheel display.
p264
aVAnd this is a burglar alarm.
p265
aVAnd that was a Humboldt squid,
p266
aVa juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.
p267
aVThis is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.
p268
aVBut if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.
p269
aVIt's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.
p270
aVBut we did see a bunch of responses like this.
p271
aVThis guy is a little more contemplative.
p272
aV"Hey, wait a minute.
p273
aVThere's supposed to be something else there."
p274
aVHe's thinking about it.
p275
aVBut he's persistent.
p276
aVHe keeps coming back.
p277
aVAnd then he goes away for a few seconds
p278
aVto think about it some more,
p279
aVand thinks,
p280
aV"Maybe if I come in from a different angle."
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVNope.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo we are starting to get a handle on this,
p285
aVbut only just the beginnings.
p286
aVWe need more eyes on the process.
p287
aVSo if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,
p288
aVby all means, climb in and take the plunge.
p289
aVThis is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,
p290
aVbecause we live on an ocean planet.
p291
aVMore than 90 percent, 99 percent,
p292
aVof the living space on our planet
p293
aVis ocean.
p294
aVIt's a magical place
p295
aVfilled with breathtaking light shows
p296
aVand bizarre and wondrous creatures,
p297
aValien life forms
p298
aVthat you don't have to travel to another planet to see.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut if you do take the plunge,
p301
aVplease remember to turn out the lights.
p302
aVBut I warn you,
p303
aVit's addictive.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.
