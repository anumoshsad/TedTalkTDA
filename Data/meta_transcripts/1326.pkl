VCholera was reported in Haiti
p4
aVfor the first time in over 50 years
p5
aVlast October.
p6
aVThere was no way to predict
p7
aVhow far it would spread through water supplies
p8
aVand how bad the situation would get.
p9
aVAnd not knowing where help was needed
p10
aValways ensured that help was in short supply
p11
aVin the areas that needed it most.
p12
aa(lp13
VWe've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms
p14
aVbefore they take innocent lives
p15
aVand cause irreversible damage,
p16
aVbut we still can't do that with water,
p17
aVand here's why.
p18
aVRight now, if you want to test water in the field,
p19
aVyou need a trained technician,
p20
aVexpensive equipment like this,
p21
aVand you have to wait about a day
p22
aVfor chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
p23
aVIt's too slow
p24
aVto get a picture of conditions on the ground
p25
aVbefore they change,
p26
aVtoo expensive to implement
p27
aVin all the places that require testing.
p28
aVAnd it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,
p29
aVpeople still need to drink water.
p30
aVMost of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak
p31
aVdidn't come from testing water;
p32
aVit came from forms like this,
p33
aVwhich documented all the people
p34
aVwe failed to help.
p35
aa(lp36
VCountless lives have been saved
p37
aVby canaries in coalmines \u2014
p38
aVa simple and invaluable way
p39
aVfor miners to know whether they're safe.
p40
aVI've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem
p41
aVwith some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.
p42
aVWe think there's a simpler solution to this problem \u2014
p43
aVone that can be used
p44
aVby people who face conditions like this everyday.
p45
aa(lp46
VIt's in its early stages,
p47
aVbut this is what it looks like right now.
p48
aVWe call it the Water Canary.
p49
aVIt's a fast, cheap device
p50
aVthat answers an important question:
p51
aVIs this water contaminated?
p52
aVIt doesn't require any special training.
p53
aVAnd instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,
p54
aVit uses light.
p55
aVThat means there's no waiting
p56
aVfor chemical reactions to take place,
p57
aVno need to use reagents that can run out
p58
aVand no need to be an expert
p59
aVto get actionable information.
p60
aa(lp61
VTo test water, you simply insert a sample
p62
aVand, within seconds,
p63
aVit either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,
p64
aVor a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
p65
aVThis will make it possible
p66
aVfor anyone to collect life-saving information
p67
aVand to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
p68
aa(lp69
VWe're also, on top of that,
p70
aVintegrating wireless networking
p71
aVinto an affordable device
p72
aVwith GPS and GSM.
p73
aVWhat that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers
p74
aVto be mapped in real time.
p75
aVWith enough users,
p76
aVmaps like this will make it possible
p77
aVto take preventive action,
p78
aVcontaining hazards before they turn into emergencies
p79
aVthat take years to recover from.
p80
aVAnd then, instead of taking days
p81
aVto disseminate this information to the people who need it most,
p82
aVit can happen automatically.
p83
aVWe've seen how distributed networks,
p84
aVbig data and information
p85
aVcan transform society.
p86
aVI think it's time for us to apply them to water.
p87
aa(lp88
VOur goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field
p89
aVand to open-source the hardware
p90
aVso that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,
p91
aVso we can tackle this problem together.
p92
aa(lp93
VThank you.
