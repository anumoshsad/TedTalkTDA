VTwo years ago here at TED
p4
aVI reported that we had discovered
p5
aVat Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,
p6
aVan anomalously warm and geologically active region
p7
aVat the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon
p8
aVEnceladus, seen here.
p9
aVThis region seen here for the first time
p10
aVin the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,
p11
aVwith the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.
p12
aVAnd seen just recently in late 2008,
p13
aVhere is that region again,
p14
aVnow half in darkness because the southern hemisphere
p15
aVis experiencing the onset of August
p16
aVand eventually winter.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery \u2014
p19
aVthis once-in-a-lifetime discovery
p20
aVof towering jets
p21
aVerupting from those fractures at the south pole,
p22
aVconsisting of tiny water ice crystals
p23
aVaccompanied by water vapor
p24
aVand simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.
p25
aVAnd at that time two years ago
p26
aVI mentioned that we were speculating
p27
aVthat these jets might in fact be geysers,
p28
aVand erupting from pockets
p29
aVor chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,
p30
aVbut we weren't really sure.
p31
aVHowever, the implications of those results \u2014
p32
aVof a possible environment within this moon
p33
aVthat could support prebiotic chemistry,
p34
aVand perhaps life itself \u2014
p35
aVwere so exciting that, in the intervening two years,
p36
aVwe have focused more on Enceladus.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe've flown the Cassini Spacecraft
p39
aVby this moon now several times,
p40
aVflying closer and deeper into these jets,
p41
aVinto the denser regions of these jets,
p42
aVso that now we have come away with some
p43
aVvery precise compositional measurements.
p44
aVAnd we have found
p45
aVthat the organic compounds coming from this moon
p46
aVare in fact more complex than we previously reported.
p47
aVWhile they're not amino acids,
p48
aVwe're now finding things like
p49
aVpropane and benzene,
p50
aVhydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.
p51
aVAnd the tiny water crystals here
p52
aVnow look for all the world
p53
aVlike they are frozen droplets of salty water,
p54
aVwhich is a discovery that suggests
p55
aVthat not only do the jets come from
p56
aVpockets of liquid water,
p57
aVbut that that liquid water is in contact with rock.
p58
aVAnd that is a circumstance
p59
aVthat could supply the chemical energy
p60
aVand the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo we are very encouraged by these results.
p63
aVAnd we are much more confident now than we were two years ago
p64
aVthat we might indeed
p65
aVhave on this moon, under the south pole,
p66
aVan environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
p67
aVWhether or not there are living organisms there, of course,
p68
aVis an entirely different matter.
p69
aVAnd that will have to await the arrival,
p70
aVback at Enceladus,
p71
aVof the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,
p72
aVspecifically equipped to address that particular question.
p73
aVBut in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day
p74
aVwhen we might journey to the Saturnine system,
p75
aVand visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,
p76
aVjust because we can.
p77
