VIn terms of invention,
p4
aVI'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.
p5
aVI think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on,
p6
aVbut I think it's also the simplest.
p7
aa(lp8
VIt's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.
p9
aVIt addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet,
p10
aVthe number one cause of death in children under five.
p11
aVWhich is ...?
p12
aVWater-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition?
p13
aVNo.
p14
aVIt's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires \u2014
p15
aVacute respiratory infections caused by this.
p16
aVCan you believe that?
p17
aa(lp18
VI find this shocking and somewhat appalling.
p19
aVCan't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels?
p20
aVCan't we make better stoves?
p21
aVHow is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?
p22
aVI know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,
p23
aVso I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,
p24
aVwhich is charcoal.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VSo this is a picture of rural Haiti.
p29
aVHaiti is now 98 percent deforested.
p30
aVYou'll see scenes like this all over the island.
p31
aVIt leads to all sorts of environmental problems
p32
aVand problems that affect people throughout the nation.
p33
aVA couple years ago there was severe flooding
p34
aVthat led to thousands of deaths \u2014
p35
aVthat's directly attributable to the fact
p36
aVthat there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.
p37
aVSo the rains come \u2014
p38
aVthey go down the rivers and the flooding happens.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this:
p41
aVpeople need to cook,
p42
aVand they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.
p43
aVIt's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.
p44
aVThey know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.
p45
aVFossil fuels are not available,
p46
aVand solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.
p47
aVAnd so this is what they do.
p48
aVYou'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree,
p49
aVcut it down and make charcoal out of it.
p50
aVSo not surprisingly,
p51
aVthere's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.
p52
aa(lp53
VAbout four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti
p54
aVand we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.
p55
aVThis is one such volunteer
p56
aVand this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.
p57
aVAnd the idea was that you could take waste paper;
p58
aVyou could compress it
p59
aVand make briquettes that could be used for fuel.
p60
aVBut this device was very slow.
p61
aVSo our engineering students went to work on it
p62
aVand with some very simple changes,
p63
aVthey were able to triple the throughput of this device.
p64
aVSo you could imagine they were very excited about it.
p65
aVAnd they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.
p66
aVAnd one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.
p67
aVSo it was a little discouraging to the students.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd in fact, if you look closely,
p72
aVright here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps."
p73
aVAs it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.
p74
aVAnd while it was a good use of government paperwork
p75
aVfor this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village,
p76
aVit was 800 kilometers away.
p77
aVAnd so we thought perhaps there might be a better way
p78
aVto come up with an alternative cooking fuel.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel
p81
aVthat used something that was readily available on the local level.
p82
aVYou see these all over Haiti as well.
p83
aVThey're small-scale sugar mills.
p84
aVAnd the waste product from them
p85
aVafter you extract the juice from the sugarcane
p86
aVis called "bagasse."
p87
aVIt has no other use.
p88
aVIt has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.
p89
aVIt just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
p90
aVWhat we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way
p91
aVto harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel
p92
aVthat would be something that people could easily cook with,
p93
aVsomething like charcoal.
p94
aVSo over the next couple of years,
p95
aVstudents and I worked to develop a process.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln
p98
aVthat you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
p99
aVAfter some time, after setting it on fire,
p100
aVyou seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln,
p101
aVand then you end up with this carbonized material here.
p102
aVHowever, you can't burn this.
p103
aVIt's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
p104
aVSo we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
p105
aVAnd conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana,
p106
aVand he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte,"
p107
aVwhich is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.
p108
aVAnd so what we did was we looked,
p109
aVand we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti,
p110
aVunder the name of "manioc."
p111
aVIn fact, it's grown all over the world \u2014
p112
aVyucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing \u2014
p113
aVa very starchy root vegetable.
p114
aVAnd you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it,
p115
aVwhich you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.
p116
aVSo we did this. We went down to Haiti.
p117
aVThese are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon,
p118
aVor Charcoal Institute.
p119
aVAnd these \u2014
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VThat's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.
p124
aVAnd these are the briquettes that we made.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow I'm going to take you to a different continent.
p127
aVThis is India
p128
aVand this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.
p129
aVIt's cow dung.
p130
aVAnd more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires,
p131
aVand this is where you see the health impacts
p132
aVof cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.
p133
aVKids and women are especially affected by it,
p134
aVbecause they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo we wanted to see
p137
aVif we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.
p138
aVWell, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane
p139
aVand they didn't have cassava,
p140
aVbut that didn't stop us.
p141
aVWhat we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.
p142
aVAnd there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.
p143
aVAnd what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure,
p144
aVwhich they used ordinarily for their fuel.
p145
aVAnd we did side-by-side tests,
p146
aVand here you can see the charcoal briquettes
p147
aVand here the cow dung.
p148
aVAnd you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.
p149
aVAnd in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.
p150
aVAnd so we were very happy, thus far.
p151
aVBut one of the things that we found
p152
aVwas when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal,
p153
aVit didn't burn as long.
p154
aVAnd the briquettes crumbled a little bit
p155
aVand we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.
p156
aVSo we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette
p157
aVso that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we went back to MIT,
p160
aVwe took out the Instron machine
p161
aVand we figured out what sort of forces you needed
p162
aVin order to compress a briquette to the level
p163
aVthat you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
p164
aVAnd at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this,
p165
aVwe also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process,
p166
aVto improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there.
p167
aVAnd after some time,
p168
aVwe developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal,
p169
aVwhich actually now burns not only \u2014
p170
aVactually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo now we're in a situation where we have a product,
p173
aVwhich is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,
p174
aVwhich is a very wonderful place to be.
p175
aVIn Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.
p176
aVThere's a possibility of this being implemented
p177
aVand saving a good portion of those.
p178
aVIn addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.
p179
aVThat's an awful lot for a country like Haiti \u2014
p180
aVwith a population of eight million
p181
aVand an average income of less than 400 dollars.
p182
aVSo this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd one of the things that I think is also interesting,
p185
aVis I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.
p186
aVAnd he's looked at the problem of the health impacts
p187
aVof burning wood versus charcoal.
p188
aVAnd he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths
p189
aVswitching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.
p190
aVThat's remarkable,
p191
aVbut up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.
p192
aVBut now we have a way
p193
aVthat's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.
p194
aa(lp195
VOne of the really exciting things, though,
p196
aVis something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month.
p197
aVAnd I think it's the coolest thing,
p198
aVand it's even lower tech than what you just saw,
p199
aVif you can imagine such a thing.
p200
aVHere it is.
p201
aVSo what is this?
p202
aVThis is corncobs turned into charcoal.
p203
aVAnd the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes \u2014
p204
aVit comes ready made.
p205
aVThis is my $100 laptop, right here.
p206
aVAnd actually, like Nick, I brought samples.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo we can pass these around.
p211
aVThey're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd I think one of the things
p216
aVwhich is also remarkable about this technology,
p217
aVis that the technology transfer is so easy.
p218
aVCompared to the sugarcane charcoal,
p219
aVwhere we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes
p220
aVand you have the extra step of cooking the binder,
p221
aVthis comes pre-briquetted.
p222
aVAnd this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now,
p223
aVwhich is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VBut once you see it, like you guys in the front row \u2014
p228
aVAll right, yeah, OK.
p229
aVSo anyway \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VHere it is.
p234
aVAnd this is, I think, a perfect example
p235
aVof what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things.
p236
aVSo not only do you have health benefits,
p237
aVyou have environmental benefits.
p238
aVBut this is one of the incredibly rare situations
p239
aVwhere you also have economic benefits.
p240
aVPeople can make their own cooking fuel from waste products.
p241
aVThey can generate income from this.
p242
aVThey can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal
p243
aVand they can produce excess and sell it in the market
p244
aVto people who aren't making their own.
p245
aVIt's really rare that you don't have trade-offs
p246
aVbetween health and economics, or environment and economics.
p247
aVSo this is a project that I just find extremely exciting
p248
aVand I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo when we talk about, now, the future we will create,
p251
aVone of the things that I think is necessary
p252
aVis to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.
p253
aVAnd now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.
p254
aVI mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday
p255
aVgrinding grain for their families to eat.
p256
aVI mean the world where advanced building materials
p257
aVmeans cement roofing tiles that are made by hand,
p258
aVand where, when you work 10 hours a day,
p259
aVyou're still only earning 60 dollars in a month.
p260
aVI mean the world
p261
aVwhere women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.
p262
aVThat's as if the entire workforce of the state of California
p263
aVworked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.
p264
aa(lp265
VIt's a place where, for example, if this were India,
p266
aVin this room, only three of us would have a car.
p267
aVIf this were Afghanistan,
p268
aVonly one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.
p269
aVIf this were Zambia \u2014
p270
aV300 of you would be farmers,
p271
aV100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.
p272
aVAnd more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
p273
aVThese are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.
p274
aVThese are the issues that we need to be training our engineers,
p275
aVour designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing.
p276
aVThese are the solutions that we need to find.
p277
aa(lp278
VI have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.
p279
aVOne of them is creating technologies
p280
aVto promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise,
p281
aVso that people who are living below the poverty line
p282
aVcan find a way to move out \u2014
p283
aVand that they're not doing it
p284
aVusing the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc.
p285
aVBut there are new technologies and new products
p286
aVthat they can make on a small scale.
p287
aa(lp288
VThe next thing I believe
p289
aVis that we need to create technologies for poor farmers
p290
aVto add value to their own crops.
p291
aVAnd we need to rethink our development strategies,
p292
aVso that we're not promoting educational campaigns
p293
aVto get them to stop being farmers,
p294
aVbut rather to stop being poor farmers.
p295
aVAnd we need to think about how we can do that effectively.
p296
aVWe need to work with the people in these communities
p297
aVand give them the resources and the tools that they need
p298
aVto solve their own problems.
p299
aVThat's the best way to do it.
p300
aVWe shouldn't be doing it from outside.
p301
aVSo we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VChris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.
p308
aVStay here.
p309
aVTell us \u2014 just while we see if someone has a question \u2014
p310
aVjust tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.
p311
aa(lp312
VAmy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on
p313
aVare ways to do low-cost water quality testing,
p314
aVso that communities can maintain their own water systems,
p315
aVknow when they're working, know when they treat them, etc.
p316
aVWe're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.
p317
aVOne of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection
p318
aVand improving the ability to be able to do that.
p319
aa(lp320
VCA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?
p321
aVDo you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists,
p322
aVor what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?
p323
aa(lp324
VAS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward.
p325
aVIt's a difficult thing \u2014
p326
aVit's a marketplace which is very fragmented
p327
aVand a consumer population with no income.
p328
aVSo you can't use the same models that you use in the United States
p329
aVfor making things move forward.
p330
aVAnd we're a pretty small staff,
p331
aVwhich is me.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, you know, I do what I can with the students.
p336
aVWe have 30 students a year go out into the field
p337
aVand try to implement this and move it forward.
p338
aVThe other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame,
p339
aVas, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years;
p340
aVyou have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.
p341
aVBut I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.
