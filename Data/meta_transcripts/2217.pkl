VYou're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.
p4
aVObviously, that's changed,
p5
aVbut only recently.
p6
aa(lp7
VIt was several months ago
p8
aVthat I gave my very first major public talk
p9
aVat the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:
p10
aV1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30.
p11
aVThat meant that in 1998,
p12
aVthe oldest among the group were only 14,
p13
aVand the youngest, just four.
p14
aVI joked with them that some might only have heard of me
p15
aVfrom rap songs.
p16
aVYes, I'm in rap songs.
p17
aVAlmost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VBut the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened.
p20
aVAt the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy.
p21
aVI know, right?
p22
aVHe was charming and I was flattered,
p23
aVand I declined.
p24
aVYou know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?
p25
aVHe could make me feel 22 again.
p26
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p27
aVI realized later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40
p28
aVwho does not want to be 22 again.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VAt the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss,
p33
aVand at the age of 24,
p34
aVI learned the devastating consequences.
p35
aa(lp36
VCan I see a show of hands of anyone here
p37
aVwho didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22?
p38
aVYep. That's what I thought.
p39
aVSo like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns
p40
aVand fallen in love with the wrong person,
p41
aVmaybe even your boss.
p42
aVUnlike me, though, your boss
p43
aVprobably wasn't the president of the United States of America.
p44
aVOf course, life is full of surprises.
p45
aa(lp46
VNot a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake,
p47
aVand I regret that mistake deeply.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance,
p50
aVI was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom
p51
aVlike we had never seen before.
p52
aVRemember, just a few years earlier,
p53
aVnews was consumed from just three places:
p54
aVreading a newspaper or magazine,
p55
aVlistening to the radio,
p56
aVor watching television.
p57
aVThat was it.
p58
aVBut that wasn't my fate.
p59
aVInstead, this scandal was brought to you
p60
aVby the digital revolution.
p61
aVThat meant we could access all the information we wanted,
p62
aVwhen we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,
p63
aVand when the story broke in January 1998,
p64
aVit broke online.
p65
aVIt was the first time the traditional news
p66
aVwas usurped by the Internet for a major news story,
p67
aVa click that reverberated around the world.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat that meant for me personally
p70
aVwas that overnight I went from being a completely private figure
p71
aVto a publicly humiliated one worldwide.
p72
aVI was patient zero of losing a personal reputation
p73
aVon a global scale almost instantaneously.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis rush to judgment, enabled by technology,
p76
aVled to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.
p77
aVGranted, it was before social media,
p78
aVbut people could still comment online,
p79
aVemail stories, and, of course, email cruel jokes.
p80
aVNews sources plastered photos of me all over
p81
aVto sell newspapers, banner ads online,
p82
aVand to keep people tuned to the TV.
p83
aVDo you recall a particular image of me,
p84
aVsay, wearing a beret?
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, I admit I made mistakes,
p87
aVespecially wearing that beret.
p88
aVBut the attention and judgment that I received, not the story,
p89
aVbut that I personally received, was unprecedented.
p90
aVI was branded as a tramp,
p91
aVtart, slut, whore, bimbo,
p92
aVand, of course, that woman.
p93
aVI was seen by many
p94
aVbut actually known by few.
p95
aVAnd I get it: it was easy to forget
p96
aVthat that woman was dimensional,
p97
aVhad a soul, and was once unbroken.
p98
aa(lp99
VWhen this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it.
p100
aVNow we call it cyberbullying and online harassment.
p101
aVToday, I want to share some of my experience with you,
p102
aVtalk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations,
p103
aVand how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results
p104
aVin less suffering for others.
p105
aa(lp106
VIn 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity.
p107
aVI lost almost everything,
p108
aVand I almost lost my life.
p109
aa(lp110
VLet me paint a picture for you.
p111
aVIt is September of 1998.
p112
aVI'm sitting in a windowless office room
p113
aVinside the Office of the Independent Counsel
p114
aVunderneath humming fluorescent lights.
p115
aVI'm listening to the sound of my voice,
p116
aVmy voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls
p117
aVthat a supposed friend had made the year before.
p118
aVI'm here because I've been legally required
p119
aVto personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation.
p120
aVFor the past eight months, the mysterious content of these tapes
p121
aVhas hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head.
p122
aVI mean, who can remember what they said a year ago?
p123
aVScared and mortified, I listen,
p124
aVlisten as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;
p125
aVlisten as I confess my love for the president,
p126
aVand, of course, my heartbreak;
p127
aVlisten to my sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self
p128
aVbeing cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;
p129
aVlisten, deeply, deeply ashamed,
p130
aVto the worst version of myself,
p131
aVa self I don't even recognize.
p132
aa(lp133
VA few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress,
p134
aVand all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.
p135
aVThat people can read the transcripts is horrific enough,
p136
aVbut a few weeks later,
p137
aVthe audio tapes are aired on TV,
p138
aVand significant portions made available online.
p139
aVThe public humiliation was excruciating.
p140
aVLife was almost unbearable.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998,
p143
aVand by this, I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions,
p144
aVconversations or photos,
p145
aVand then making them public \u2014
p146
aVpublic without consent,
p147
aVpublic without context,
p148
aVand public without compassion.
p149
aa(lp150
VFast forward 12 years to 2010,
p151
aVand now social media has been born.
p152
aVThe landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine,
p153
aVwhether or not someone actually make a mistake,
p154
aVand now it's for both public and private people.
p155
aVThe consequences for some have become dire, very dire.
p156
aa(lp157
VI was on the phone with my mom
p158
aVin September of 2010,
p159
aVand we were talking about the news
p160
aVof a young college freshman from Rutgers University
p161
aVnamed Tyler Clementi.
p162
aVSweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
p163
aVwas secretly webcammed by his roommate
p164
aVwhile being intimate with another man.
p165
aVWhen the online world learned of this incident,
p166
aVthe ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.
p167
aVA few days later,
p168
aVTyler jumped from  the George Washington Bridge
p169
aVto his death.
p170
aVHe was 18.
p171
aa(lp172
VMy mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family,
p173
aVand she was gutted with pain
p174
aVin a way that I just couldn't quite understand,
p175
aVand then eventually I realized
p176
aVshe was reliving 1998,
p177
aVreliving a time when she sat by my bed every night,
p178
aVreliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open,
p179
aVand reliving a time when both of my parents feared
p180
aVthat I would be humiliated to death,
p181
aVliterally.
p182
aa(lp183
VToday, too many parents
p184
aVhaven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones.
p185
aVToo many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation
p186
aVafter it was too late.
p187
aVTyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me.
p188
aVIt served to recontextualize my experiences,
p189
aVand I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me
p190
aVand see something different.
p191
aVIn 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology
p192
aVcalled the Internet would take us.
p193
aVSince then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways,
p194
aVjoining lost siblings,
p195
aVsaving lives, launching revolutions,
p196
aVbut the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced
p197
aVhad mushroomed.
p198
aVEvery day online, people, especially young people
p199
aVwho are not developmentally equipped to handle this,
p200
aVare so abused and humiliated
p201
aVthat they can't imagine living to the next day,
p202
aVand some, tragically, don't,
p203
aVand there's nothing virtual about that.
p204
aVChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues,
p205
aVreleased a staggering statistic late last year:
p206
aVFrom 2012 to 2013,
p207
aVthere was an 87 percent increase
p208
aVin calls and emails related to cyberbullying.
p209
aVA meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands
p210
aVshowed that for the first time,
p211
aVcyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations
p212
aVmore significantly than offline bullying.
p213
aVAnd you know what shocked me, although it shouldn't have,
p214
aVwas other research last year that determined humiliation
p215
aVwas a more intensely felt emotion
p216
aVthan either happiness or even anger.
p217
aa(lp218
VCruelty to others is nothing new,
p219
aVbut online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified,
p220
aVuncontained, and permanently accessible.
p221
aVThe echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village,
p222
aVschool or community,
p223
aVbut now it's the online community too.
p224
aVMillions of people, often anonymously,
p225
aVcan stab you with their words, and that's a lot of pain,
p226
aVand there are no perimeters around how many people
p227
aVcan publicly observe you
p228
aVand put you in a public stockade.
p229
aVThere is a very personal price
p230
aVto public humiliation,
p231
aVand the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price.
p232
aa(lp233
VFor nearly two decades now,
p234
aVwe have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation
p235
aVin our cultural soil, both on- and offline.
p236
aVGossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics,
p237
aVnews outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame.
p238
aVIt's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online
p239
aVwhich lends itself to trolling, invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.
p240
aVThis shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls
p241
aVa culture of humiliation.
p242
aVConsider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone.
p243
aVSnapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations
p244
aVand claims that its messages only have the lifespan
p245
aVof a few seconds.
p246
aVYou can imagine the range of content that that gets.
p247
aVA third-party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan
p248
aVof the messages was hacked,
p249
aVand 100,000 personal conversations, photos, and videos were leaked online
p250
aVto now have a lifespan of forever.
p251
aVJennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked,
p252
aVand private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the Internet
p253
aVwithout their permission.
p254
aVOne gossip website had over five million hits
p255
aVfor this one story.
p256
aVAnd what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?
p257
aVThe documents which received the most attention
p258
aVwere private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut in this culture of humiliation,
p261
aVthere is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming.
p262
aVThe price does not measure the cost to the victim,
p263
aVwhich Tyler and too many others,
p264
aVnotably women, minorities,
p265
aVand members of the LGBTQ community have paid,
p266
aVbut the price measures the profit of those who prey on them.
p267
aVThis invasion of others is a raw material,
p268
aVefficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit.
p269
aVA marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity
p270
aVand shame is an industry.
p271
aVHow is the money made?
p272
aVClicks.
p273
aVThe more shame, the more clicks.
p274
aVThe more clicks, the more advertising dollars.
p275
aVWe're in a dangerous cycle.
p276
aVThe more we click on this kind of gossip,
p277
aVthe more numb we get to the human lives behind it,
p278
aVand the more numb we get, the more we click.
p279
aVAll the while, someone is making money
p280
aVoff of the back  of someone else's suffering.
p281
aVWith every click, we make a choice.
p282
aVThe more we saturate our culture with public shaming,
p283
aVthe more accepted it is,
p284
aVthe more we will see behavior like cyberbullying,
p285
aVtrolling, some forms of hacking,
p286
aVand online harassment.
p287
aVWhy? Because they all have humiliation at their cores.
p288
aVThis behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created.
p289
aVJust think about it.
p290
aa(lp291
VChanging behavior begins with evolving beliefs.
p292
aVWe've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia,
p293
aVand plenty of other biases, today and in the past.
p294
aVAs we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage,
p295
aVmore people have been offered equal freedoms.
p296
aVWhen we began valuing sustainability,
p297
aVmore people began to recycle.
p298
aVSo as far as our culture of humiliation goes,
p299
aVwhat we need is a cultural revolution.
p300
aVPublic shaming as a blood sport has to stop,
p301
aVand it's time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture.
p302
aa(lp303
VThe shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy.
p304
aVWe need to return to a long-held value of compassion \u2014 compassion and empathy.
p305
aVOnline, we've got a compassion deficit,
p306
aVan empathy crisis.
p307
aa(lp308
VResearcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,
p309
aV"Shame can't survive empathy."
p310
aVShame cannot survive empathy.
p311
aVI've seen some very dark days in my life,
p312
aVand it was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals,
p313
aVand sometimes even strangers that saved me.
p314
aVEven empathy from one person can make a difference.
p315
aVThe theory of minority influence,
p316
aVproposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici,
p317
aVsays that even in small numbers,
p318
aVwhen there's consistency over time,
p319
aVchange can happen.
p320
aVIn the online world, we can foster minority influence
p321
aVby becoming upstanders.
p322
aVTo become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy,
p323
aVwe can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation.
p324
aVTrust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity.
p325
aVWe can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations
p326
aVthat deal with these kinds of issues,
p327
aVlike the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S.,
p328
aVIn the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,
p329
aVand in Australia, there's Project Rockit.
p330
aa(lp331
VWe talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression,
p332
aVbut we need to talk more about
p333
aVour responsibility to freedom of expression.
p334
aVWe all want to be heard,
p335
aVbut let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention
p336
aVand speaking up for attention.
p337
aVThe Internet is  the superhighway for the id,
p338
aVbut online, showing empathy to others
p339
aVbenefits us all and helps create a safer and better world.
p340
aVWe need to communicate online with compassion,
p341
aVconsume news with compassion,
p342
aVand click with compassion.
p343
aVJust imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.
p344
aVI'd like to end on a personal note.
p345
aVIn the past nine months,
p346
aVthe question I've been  asked the most is why.
p347
aVWhy now? Why was I  sticking my head above the parapet?
p348
aVYou can read between the lines in those questions,
p349
aVand the answer has nothing to do with politics.
p350
aVThe top note answer was and is because it's time:
p351
aVtime to stop tip-toeing around my past;
p352
aVtime to stop living a life of opprobrium;
p353
aVand time to take back my narrative.
p354
aa(lp355
VIt's also not just about saving myself.
p356
aVAnyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation
p357
aVneeds to know one thing:
p358
aVYou can survive it.
p359
aVI know it's hard.
p360
aVIt may not be painless, quick or easy,
p361
aVbut you can insist on a different ending to your story.
p362
aVHave compassion for yourself.
p363
aVWe all deserve compassion,
p364
aVand to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.
p365
