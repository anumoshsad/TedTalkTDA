VI live in Washington, D.C.,
p4
aVbut I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa, in India.
p5
aVMy father was a government worker.
p6
aVMy mother could not read or write, but she
p7
aVwould say to me, "A king is  worshipped only in his
p8
aVown kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."
p9
aVSo I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.
p10
aVBut I almost didn't go to college
p11
aVuntil an aunt offered financial help.
p12
aa(lp13
VI went to study in Sambalpur,
p14
aVthe largest town in the region,
p15
aVwhere, already in college, I saw a television for the first time.
p16
aVI had dreams of going to the United States
p17
aVfor higher studies.
p18
aVWhen the opportunity came,
p19
aVI crossed two oceans, with borrowed money
p20
aVfor airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.
p21
aVIn the U.S., I worked in a research center,
p22
aVpart-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.
p23
aVAnd with the little I earned, I would
p24
aVfinance myself and then I would send
p25
aVmoney home to my brother and my father.
p26
aa(lp27
VMy story is not unique.
p28
aVThere are millions of people who migrate each year.
p29
aVWith the help of the family, they cross oceans,
p30
aVthey cross deserts, they cross  rivers, they cross mountains.
p31
aVThey risk their lives to realize a dream,
p32
aVand that dream is as simple as having a
p33
aVdecent job somewhere so they can send money home
p34
aVand help the family,
p35
aVwhich has helped them before.
p36
aa(lp37
VThere are 232 million international  migrants in the world.
p38
aVThese are people who live in a country
p39
aVother than their country of birth.
p40
aVIf there was a country made up of
p41
aVonly international migrants,
p42
aVthat would be larger, in population,
p43
aVthan Brazil.
p44
aVThat would be larger, in its size
p45
aVof the economy, than France.
p46
aVSome 180 million of them, from poor countries,
p47
aVsend money home regularly.
p48
aa(lp49
VThose sums of money are called remittances.
p50
aVHere is a fact that might surprise you:
p51
aV413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars
p52
aVwas the amount of remittances sent last year
p53
aVby migrants to developing countries.
p54
aVMigrants from developing countries,
p55
aVmoney sent to developing countries \u2014
p56
aV413 billion dollars.
p57
aVThat's a remarkable number because
p58
aVthat is three times the size of
p59
aVthe total of development aid money.
p60
aVAnd yet, you and I,
p61
aVmy colleagues in Washington,
p62
aVwe endlessly debate and
p63
aVdiscuss about development aid,
p64
aVwhile we ignore remittances as small change.
p65
aa(lp66
VTrue, people send 200 dollars per month,
p67
aVon average. But, repeated month after month,
p68
aVby millions of people,
p69
aVthese sums of money add up to rivers  of foreign currency.
p70
aVSo India, last year, received 72  billion dollars, larger than
p71
aVits IT exports.
p72
aVIn Egypt remittances are three times
p73
aVthe size of revenues from the Suez Canal.
p74
aVIn Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.
p75
aVAnd in poorer countries, smaller  countries, fragile countries,
p76
aVconflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,
p77
aVas in Somalia or in Haiti.
p78
aa(lp79
VNo wonder these flows have huge
p80
aVimpacts on economies and on poor people.
p81
aVRemittances, unlike private investment money,
p82
aVthey don't flow back at the first
p83
aVsign of trouble in the country.
p84
aVThey actually act like an insurance.
p85
aVWhen the family is in trouble,
p86
aVfacing hardship, facing hard times,
p87
aVremittances increase, they act like an insurance.
p88
aVMigrants send more money then.
p89
aVUnlike development aid money,
p90
aVthat must go through official agencies,
p91
aVthrough governments, remittances
p92
aVdirectly reach the poor,
p93
aVreach the family,
p94
aVand often with business advice.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo in Nepal, the share of poor
p97
aVpeople was 42 percent in 1995,
p98
aVthe share of poor people in the population.
p99
aVBy 2005, a decade later, at a
p100
aVtime of political crisis, economic crisis,
p101
aVthe share of poor people went down to 31 percent.
p102
aVThat decline in poverty, most of it,
p103
aVabout half of it, is believed to be
p104
aVbecause of remittances from India,
p105
aVanother poor country.
p106
aVIn El Salvador, the school dropout
p107
aVrate among children is lower
p108
aVin families that receive remittances.
p109
aVIn Mexico and Sri Lanka,
p110
aVthe birth weight of children is higher
p111
aVamong families that receive remittances.
p112
aa(lp113
VRemittances are dollars wrapped with care.
p114
aVMigrants send money home for food,
p115
aVfor buying necessities, for building houses,
p116
aVfor funding education, for funding
p117
aVhealthcare for the elderly, for business
p118
aVinvestments for friends and family.
p119
aVMigrants send even more money home
p120
aVfor special occasions like a surgery
p121
aVor a wedding. And migrants also send
p122
aVmoney, perhaps far too many times,
p123
aVfor unexpected funerals that
p124
aVthey cannot attend.
p125
aa(lp126
VMuch as these flows do all that good,
p127
aVthere are barriers to these
p128
aVflows of remittances, these
p129
aV400 billion dollars of remittances.
p130
aVForemost among them is
p131
aVthe exorbitant cost of sending money home.
p132
aVMoney transfer companies structure
p133
aVtheir fees to milk the poor.
p134
aVThey will say, "Up to 500 dollars
p135
aVif you want to send, we will charge you
p136
aV30 dollars fixed."
p137
aVIf you are poor and if you have  only 200 dollars to send,
p138
aVyou have to pay that $30 fee.
p139
aVThe global average cost of sending
p140
aVmoney is eight percent.
p141
aVThat means you send 100 dollars,
p142
aVthe family on the other side receives only
p143
aV92 dollars.
p144
aVTo send money to Africa,
p145
aVthe cost is even higher:
p146
aV12 percent.
p147
aVTo send money within Africa,
p148
aVthe cost is even higher:
p149
aVover 20 percent.
p150
aVFor example, sending money from Benin  to Nigeria.
p151
aVAnd then there is the case of Venezuela, where,
p152
aVbecause of exchange controls,
p153
aVyou send 100 dollars and you
p154
aVare lucky if the family on the other side
p155
aVreceives even 10 dollars.
p156
aVOf course, nobody sends money to Venezuela
p157
aVthrough the official channel.
p158
aVIt all goes in suitcases.
p159
aVWhereever costs are high,
p160
aVmoney goes underground.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd what is worse,
p163
aVmany developing countries actually
p164
aVhave a blanket ban on sending money
p165
aVout of the country.
p166
aVMany rich nations also have a
p167
aVblanket ban on sending money  to specific countries.
p168
aVSo, is it that there are no options,
p169
aVno better options, cheaper options, to send money?
p170
aa(lp171
VThere are.
p172
aVM-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money
p173
aVand receive money at a fixed cost of only
p174
aV60 cents per transaction.
p175
aVU.S. Fed started a program with Mexico
p176
aVto enable money service businesses
p177
aVto send money to Mexico
p178
aVfor a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.
p179
aVAnd yet, these faster, cheaper, better options
p180
aVcan't be applied internationally
p181
aVbecause of the fear of money laundering,
p182
aVeven though there is little data
p183
aVto support any connection, any significant
p184
aVconnection between money laundering
p185
aVand these small remittance transactions.
p186
aVMany international banks now
p187
aVare wary of hosting bank accounts
p188
aVof money service businesses, especially
p189
aVthose serving Somalia.
p190
aa(lp191
VSomalia, a country where the
p192
aVper capita income is only 250 dollars per year.
p193
aVMonthly remittances, on average, to Somalia
p194
aVis larger than that amount.
p195
aVRemittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.
p196
aVAnd yet, this is an example of
p197
aVthe right hand giving a lot of aid,
p198
aVwhile the left hand is cutting the lifeblood
p199
aVto that economy, through regulations.
p200
aVThen there is the case of poor people from villages, like me.
p201
aVIn the villages, the only place where you can
p202
aVget money is through the post office.
p203
aVMost of the governments in the world
p204
aVhave allowed their post offices to have
p205
aVexclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.
p206
aVSo, if I have to send money to my
p207
aVfather in the village, I must send money
p208
aVthrough that particular money transfer company,
p209
aVeven if the cost is high.
p210
aVI cannot go to a cheaper option.
p211
aVThis has to go.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo, what can international organizations and
p214
aVsocial entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost
p215
aVof sending money home?
p216
aVFirst, relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars.
p217
aVGovernments should recognize that
p218
aVsmall remittances are not money laundering.
p219
aVSecond, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships
p220
aVbetween their post office and the money  transfer company.
p221
aVFor that matter, between the post office
p222
aVand any national banking system that
p223
aVhas a large network that serves the poor.
p224
aVIn fact, they should promote competition,
p225
aVopen up the partnership so that
p226
aVwe will bring down costs like we did,
p227
aVlike they did, in the telecommunications industry.
p228
aVYou have seen what has happened there.
p229
aVThird, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations
p230
aVshould create a remittance platform
p231
aVon a nonprofit basis.
p232
aVThey should create a nonprofit
p233
aVremittance platform to serve the money transfer
p234
aVcompanies so that they can send money at a low cost,
p235
aVwhile complying with all the complex
p236
aVregulations all over the world.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe development community should
p239
aVset a goal of reducing remittance costs
p240
aVto one percent from the current eight percent.
p241
aVIf we reduce costs to one percent,
p242
aVthat would release a saving of  30 billion dollars per year.
p243
aVThirty billion dollars, that's  larger than the entire
p244
aVbilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.
p245
aVThat is larger than, or almost similar to,
p246
aVthe total aid budget of the United States government,
p247
aVthe largest donor on the planet.
p248
aVActually, the savings would be larger
p249
aVthan that 30 billion because remittance channels
p250
aVare also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnother major impediment to the
p253
aVflow of remittances reaching the family
p254
aVis the large and exorbitant
p255
aVand illegal cost of recruitment,
p256
aVfees that migrants pay, migrant workers
p257
aVpay to laborers who found them the job.
p258
aa(lp259
VI was in Dubai a few years ago.
p260
aVI visited a camp for workers.
p261
aVIt was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.
p262
aVWorkers were coming back from
p263
aVtheir grueling day of work,
p264
aVand I struck a conversation
p265
aVwith a Bangladeshi construction worker.
p266
aVHe was preoccupied that he is sending
p267
aVmoney home, he has been
p268
aVsending money home for a few months now,
p269
aVand the money is mostly going
p270
aVto the recruitment agent, to the labor agent
p271
aVwho found him that job.
p272
aVAnd in my mind, I could picture
p273
aVthe wife waiting for
p274
aVthe monthly remittance.
p275
aVThe remittance arrives.
p276
aVShe takes the money and hands
p277
aVit over to the recruitment agent,
p278
aVwhile the children are looking on.
p279
aVThis has to stop.
p280
aa(lp281
VIt is not only construction  workers from Bangladesh,
p282
aVit is all the workers. There are millions of migrant
p283
aVworkers who suffer from this problem.
p284
aVA construction worker from Bangladesh,
p285
aVon an average, pays about 4,000  dollars in recruitment fees
p286
aVfor a job that gives him only 2,000  dollars per year in income.
p287
aVThat means that for the two years or three years
p288
aVof his life, he is basically sending money
p289
aVto pay for the recruitment fees.
p290
aVThe family doesn't get to see any of it.
p291
aa(lp292
VIt is not only Dubai, it is the dark
p293
aVunderbelly of every major city in the world.
p294
aVIt is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,
p295
aVit is workers from all over the world.
p296
aVIt is not only men.
p297
aVWomen are especially vulnerable to
p298
aVrecruitment malpractices.
p299
aa(lp300
VOne of the most exciting and newest
p301
aVthing happening in the area of remittances
p302
aVis how to mobilize, through innovation,
p303
aVdiaspora saving and diaspora giving.
p304
aVMigrants send money home,
p305
aVbut they also save a large amount of
p306
aVmoney where they live.
p307
aVAnnually, migrant savings are estimated
p308
aVto be 500 billion dollars.
p309
aVMost of that money is parked in
p310
aVbank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.
p311
aVIf a country were to come  and offer a three percent
p312
aVor four percent interest rate, and then say
p313
aVthat the money would be used for building schools,
p314
aVroads, airports, train systems
p315
aVin the country of origin, a lot
p316
aVof migrants would be interested in
p317
aVparting with their money because
p318
aVit's not only financial gains that
p319
aVgive them an opportunity
p320
aVto stay engaged with their country's development.
p321
aVRemittance channels can be used
p322
aVto sell these bonds to migrants
p323
aVbecause when they come
p324
aVon a monthly basis to send remittances,
p325
aVthat's when you can actually sell it to them.
p326
aVYou can also do the same
p327
aVfor mobilizing diaspora giving.
p328
aVI would love to invest in a
p329
aVbullet train system in India
p330
aVand I would love to contribute to efforts
p331
aVto fight malaria in my village.
p332
aVRemittances are a great way of
p333
aVsharing prosperity between places
p334
aVin a targeted way that benefits
p335
aVthose who need them most.
p336
aa(lp337
VRemittances empower people.
p338
aVWe must do all we can to make remittances
p339
aVand recruitment
p340
aVsafer and cheaper.
p341
aVAnd it can be done.
p342
aa(lp343
VAs for myself, I have been
p344
aVaway from India for two decades now.
p345
aVMy wife is a Venezuelan.
p346
aVMy children are Americans.
p347
aVIncreasingly, I feel like a global citizen.
p348
aVAnd yet, I am growing nostalgic
p349
aVabout my country of birth.
p350
aVI want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.
p351
aVMy parents are not there anymore.
p352
aVMy brothers and sisters have moved on.
p353
aVThere is no real urgency for me to send money home.
p354
aVAnd yet, from time to time,
p355
aVI send money home to friends,
p356
aVto relatives, to the village,
p357
aVto be there, to stay engaged \u2014
p358
aVthat's part of my identity.
p359
aVAnd, I'm still striving to be a poet
p360
aVfor the hardworking migrants
p361
aVand their struggle to break free
p362
aVof the cycle of poverty.
p363
aVThank you.
