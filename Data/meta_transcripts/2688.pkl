(lp3
VSo have you ever wondered what it would be like
p4
aVto live in a place with no rules?
p5
aVThat sounds pretty cool.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VYou wake up one morning, however,
p10
aVand you discover that the reason there are no rules
p11
aVis because there's no government, and there are no laws.
p12
aVIn fact, all social institutions have disappeared.
p13
aVSo there's no schools,
p14
aVthere's no hospitals,
p15
aVthere's no police,
p16
aVthere's no banks,
p17
aVthere's no athletic clubs,
p18
aVthere's no utilities.
p19
aa(lp20
VWell, I know a little bit about what this is like,
p21
aVbecause when I was a medical student in 1999,
p22
aVI worked in a refugee camp in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.
p23
aVWhen the war was over,
p24
aVI got permission \u2014 unbelievably \u2014 from my medical school
p25
aVto take some time off
p26
aVand follow some of the families that I had befriended in the camp
p27
aVback to their village in Kosovo,
p28
aVand understand how they navigated life in this postwar setting.
p29
aa(lp30
VPostwar Kosovo was a very interesting place
p31
aVbecause NATO troops were there,
p32
aVmostly to make sure the war didn't break out again.
p33
aVBut other than that, it was actually a lawless place,
p34
aVand almost every social institution, both public and private,
p35
aVhad been destroyed.
p36
aVSo I can tell you
p37
aVthat when you go into one of these situations and settings,
p38
aVit is absolutely thrilling ...
p39
aVfor about 30 minutes,
p40
aVbecause that's about how long it takes before you run into a situation
p41
aVwhere you realize how incredibly vulnerable you are.
p42
aa(lp43
VFor me, that moment came when I had to cross the first checkpoint,
p44
aVand I realized as I drove up
p45
aVthat I would be negotiating passage through this checkpoint
p46
aVwith a heavily armed individual
p47
aVwho, if he decided to shoot me right then and there,
p48
aVactually wouldn't be doing anything illegal.
p49
aVBut the sense of vulnerability that I had was absolutely nothing
p50
aVin comparison to the vulnerability of the families that I got to know
p51
aVover that year.
p52
aa(lp53
VYou see, life in a society where there are no social institutions
p54
aVis riddled with danger and uncertainty,
p55
aVand simple questions like, "What are we going to eat tonight?"
p56
aVare very complicated to answer.
p57
aVQuestions about security, when you don't have any security systems,
p58
aVare terrifying.
p59
aVIs that altercation I had with the neighbor down the block
p60
aVgoing to turn into a violent episode that will end my life
p61
aVor my family's life?
p62
aa(lp63
VHealth concerns when there is no health system
p64
aVare also terrifying.
p65
aVI listened as many families had to sort through questions like,
p66
aV"My infant has a fever. What am I going to do?"
p67
aV"My sister, who is pregnant, is bleeding. What should I do?
p68
aVWho should I turn to?"
p69
aV"Where are the doctors, where are the nurses?
p70
aVIf I could find one, are they trustworthy?
p71
aVHow will I pay them? In what currency will I pay them?"
p72
aV"If I need medications, where will I find them?
p73
aVIf I take those medications, are they actually counterfeits?"
p74
aVAnd on and on.
p75
aVSo for life in these settings,
p76
aVthe dominant theme, the dominant feature of life,
p77
aVis the incredible vulnerability that people have to manage
p78
aVday in and day out,
p79
aVbecause of the lack of social systems.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd it actually turns out
p82
aVthat this feature of life is incredibly difficult to explain
p83
aVand be understood by people who are living outside of it.
p84
aVI discovered this when I left Kosovo.
p85
aVI came back to Boston, I became a physician,
p86
aVI became a global public health policy researcher.
p87
aVI joined the Harvard Medical School
p88
aVand Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Global Health.
p89
aVAnd I, as a researcher,
p90
aVreally wanted to get started on this problem right away.
p91
aVI was like, "How do we reduce the crushing vulnerability
p92
aVof people living in these types of fragile settings?
p93
aVIs there any way we can start to think about
p94
aVhow to protect and quickly recover
p95
aVthe institutions that are critical to survival,
p96
aVlike the health system?"
p97
aVAnd I have to say, I had amazing colleagues.
p98
aVBut one interesting thing about it was,
p99
aVthis was sort of an unusual question for them.
p100
aVThey were kind of like, "Oh, if you work in war,
p101
aVdoesn't that mean you work on refugee camps,
p102
aVand you work on documenting mass atrocities?" \u2014
p103
aVwhich is, by the way, very, very, very important.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo it took me a while to explain why I was so passionate about this issue,
p106
aVuntil about six years ago.
p107
aVThat's when this landmark study
p108
aVthat looked at and described the public health consequences of war
p109
aVwas published.
p110
aVThey came to an incredible, provocative conclusion.
p111
aVThese researchers concluded
p112
aVthat the vast majority of death and disability from war
p113
aVhappens after the cessation of conflict.
p114
aVSo the most dangerous time to be a person living in a conflict-affected state
p115
aVis after the cessation of hostilities;
p116
aVit's after the peace deal has been signed.
p117
aVIt's when that political solution has been achieved.
p118
aVThat seems so puzzling, but of course it's not,
p119
aVbecause war kills people by robbing them of their clinics,
p120
aVof their hospitals,
p121
aVof their supply chains.
p122
aVTheir doctors are targeted, are killed; they're on the run.
p123
aVAnd more invisible and yet more deadly is the destruction
p124
aVof the health governance institutions and their finances.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo this is really not surprising at all to me.
p127
aVBut what is surprising and somewhat dismaying,
p128
aVis how little impact this insight has had,
p129
aVin terms of how we think about human suffering and war.
p130
aVLet me give you a couple examples.
p131
aa(lp132
VLast year, you may remember,
p133
aVEbola hit the West African country of Liberia.
p134
aVThere was a lot of reporting about this group, Doctors Without Borders,
p135
aVsounding the alarm and calling for aid and assistance.
p136
aVBut not a lot of that reporting answered the question:
p137
aVWhy is Doctors Without Borders even in Liberia?
p138
aVDoctors Without Borders is an amazing organization,
p139
aVdedicated and designed to provide emergency care in war zones.
p140
aVLiberia's civil war had ended in 2003 \u2014
p141
aVthat was 11 years before Ebola even struck.
p142
aVWhen Ebola struck Liberia,
p143
aVthere were less than 50 doctors in the entire country
p144
aVof 4.5 million people.
p145
aVDoctors Without Borders is in Liberia
p146
aVbecause Liberia still doesn't really have a functioning health system,
p147
aV11 years later.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhen the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,
p150
aVthe outpouring of international aid was phenomenal.
p151
aVBut did you know that only two percent of that funding
p152
aVwent to rebuild Haitian public institutions,
p153
aVincluding its health sector?
p154
aVFrom that perspective,
p155
aVHaitians continue to die from the earthquake even today.
p156
aa(lp157
VI recently met this gentleman.
p158
aVThis is Dr. Nezar Ismet.
p159
aVHe's the Minister of Health in the northern autonomous region of Iraq,
p160
aVin Kurdistan.
p161
aVHere he is announcing that in the last nine months,
p162
aVhis country, his region, has increased from four million people
p163
aVto five million people.
p164
aVThat's a 25 percent increase.
p165
aVThousands of these new arrivals have experienced incredible trauma.
p166
aVHis doctors are working 16-hour days without pay.
p167
aVHis budget has not increased by 25 percent;
p168
aVit has decreased by 20 percent,
p169
aVas funding has flowed to security concerns and to short-term relief efforts.
p170
aVWhen his health sector fails \u2014
p171
aVand if history is any guide, it will \u2014
p172
aVhow do you think that's going to influence
p173
aVthe decision making of the five million people in his region
p174
aVas they think about whether they should flee
p175
aVthat type of vulnerable living situation?
p176
aa(lp177
VSo as you can see, this is a frustrating topic for me,
p178
aVand I really try to understand:
p179
aVWhy the reluctance to protect and support
p180
aVindigenous health systems and security systems?
p181
aVI usually tier two concerns, two arguments.
p182
aVThe first concern is about corruption,
p183
aVand the concern that people in these settings are corrupt
p184
aVand they are untrustworthy.
p185
aVAnd I will admit that I have met unsavory characters
p186
aVworking in health sectors in these situations.
p187
aVBut I will tell you that the opposite is absolutely true
p188
aVin every case I have worked on,
p189
aVfrom Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo, to Haiti, to Liberia \u2014
p190
aVI have met inspiring people,
p191
aVwho, when the chips were down for their country,
p192
aVthey risked everything to save their health institutions.
p193
aVThe trick for the outsider who wants to help
p194
aVis identifying who those individuals are,
p195
aVand building a pathway for them to lead.
p196
aa(lp197
VThat is exactly what happened in Afghanistan.
p198
aVOne of the unsung and untold success stories
p199
aVof our nation-building effort in Afghanistan
p200
aVinvolved the World Bank in 2002 investing heavily
p201
aVin identifying, training and promoting Afghani health sector leaders.
p202
aVThese health sector leaders have pulled off an incredible feat
p203
aVin Afghanistan.
p204
aVThey have aggressively increased access to health care
p205
aVfor the majority of the population.
p206
aVThey are rapidly improving the health status
p207
aVof the Afghan population,
p208
aVwhich used to be the worst in the world.
p209
aVIn fact, the Afghan Ministry of Health does things
p210
aVthat I wish we would do in America.
p211
aVThey use things like data to make policy.
p212
aVIt's incredible.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VThe other concern I hear a lot about is:
p217
aV"We just can't afford it, we just don't have the money.
p218
aVIt's just unsustainable."
p219
aVI would submit to you that the current situation
p220
aVand the current system we have
p221
aVis the most expensive, inefficient system we could possibly conceive of.
p222
aVThe current situation is that when governments like the US \u2014
p223
aVor, let's say, the collection of governments
p224
aVthat make up the European Commission \u2014
p225
aVevery year, they spend 15 billion dollars
p226
aVon just humanitarian and emergency and disaster relief worldwide.
p227
aVThat's nothing about foreign aid, that's just disaster relief.
p228
aVNinety-five percent of it goes to international relief agencies,
p229
aVthat then have to import resources into these areas,
p230
aVand knit together some type of temporary health system, let's say,
p231
aVwhich they then dismantle and send away when they run out of money.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo our job, it turns out, is very clear.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe, as the global health community policy experts,
p236
aVour first job is to become experts in how to monitor
p237
aVthe strengths and vulnerabilities of health systems
p238
aVin threatened situations.
p239
aVAnd that's when we see doctors fleeing,
p240
aVwhen we see health resources drying up,
p241
aVwhen we see institutions crumbling \u2014
p242
aVthat's the emergency.
p243
aVThat's when we need to sound the alarm and wave our arms.
p244
aVOK?
p245
aVNot now.
p246
aVEveryone can see that's an emergency, they don't need us to tell them that.
p247
aa(lp248
VNumber two:
p249
aVplaces like where I work at Harvard need to take their cue
p250
aVfrom the World Bank experience in Afghanistan,
p251
aVand we need to \u2014 and we will \u2014
p252
aVbuild robust platforms to support health sector leaders like these.
p253
aVThese people risk their lives.
p254
aVI think we can match their courage with some support.
p255
aa(lp256
VNumber three:
p257
aVwe need to reach out and make new partnerships.
p258
aVAt our global health center,
p259
aVwe have launched a new initiative with NATO and other security policy makers
p260
aVto explore with them what they can do to protect health system institutions
p261
aVduring deployments.
p262
aVWe want them to see
p263
aVthat protecting health systems and other critical social institutions
p264
aVis an integral part of their mission.
p265
aVIt's not just about avoiding collateral damage;
p266
aVit's about winning the peace.
p267
aa(lp268
VBut the most important partner we need to engage is you,
p269
aVthe American public, and indeed, the world public.
p270
aVBecause unless you understand the value of social institutions,
p271
aVlike health systems in these fragile settings,
p272
aVyou won't support efforts to save them.
p273
aVYou won't click on that article
p274
aVthat talks about "Hey, all those doctors are on the run in country X.
p275
aVI wonder what that means.
p276
aVI wonder what that means
p277
aVfor that health system's ability to, let's say, detect influenza."
p278
aV"Hmm, it's probably not good." That's what I'd tell you.
p279
aa(lp280
VUp on the screen,
p281
aVI've put up my three favorite American institution defenders and builders.
p282
aVOver here is George C. Marshall,
p283
aVhe was the guy that proposed the Marshall Plan
p284
aVto save all of Europe's economic institutions after World War II.
p285
aVAnd this Eleanor Roosevelt.
p286
aVHer work on human rights really serves as the foundation
p287
aVfor all of our international human rights organizations.
p288
aVThen my big favorite is Ben Franklin,
p289
aVwho did many things in terms of creating institutions,
p290
aVbut was the midwife of our constitution.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd I would say to you
p293
aVthat these are folks who, when our country was threatened,
p294
aVor our world was threatened,
p295
aVthey didn't retreat.
p296
aVThey didn't talk about building walls.
p297
aVThey talked about building institutions to protect human security,
p298
aVfor their generation and also for ours.
p299
aVAnd I think our generation should do the same.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you.
