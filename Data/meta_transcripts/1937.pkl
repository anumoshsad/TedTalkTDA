VAlmost two years ago,
p4
aVI was driving in my car in Germany,
p5
aVand I turned on the radio.
p6
aVEurope at the time was in the middle
p7
aVof the Euro crisis,
p8
aVand all the headlines were about European countries
p9
aVgetting downgraded by rating agencies
p10
aVin the United States.
p11
aVI listened and thought to myself,
p12
aV"What are these rating agencies,
p13
aVand why is everybody so upset about their work?"
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, if you were sitting
p16
aVnext to me in the car that day
p17
aVand would have told me that I would devote
p18
aVthe next years to trying to reform them,
p19
aVobviously I would have called you crazy.
p20
aVBut guess what's really crazy:
p21
aVthe way these rating agencies are run.
p22
aVAnd I would like to explain to you
p23
aVnot only why it's time to change this,
p24
aVbut also how we can do it.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo let me tell you a little bit
p27
aVabout what rating agencies really do.
p28
aVAs you would read a car magazine
p29
aVbefore purchasing a new car
p30
aVor taking a look at a product review
p31
aVbefore deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,
p32
aVinvestors are reading ratings
p33
aVbefore they decide in which kind of product
p34
aVthey are investing their money.
p35
aVA rating can range from a so-called AAA,
p36
aVwhich means it's a top-performing product,
p37
aVand it can go down to the level
p38
aVof the so-called BBB-,
p39
aVwhich means it's a fairly risky investment.
p40
aVRating agencies are rating companies.
p41
aVThey are rating banks.
p42
aVThey are rating even financial products
p43
aVlike the infamous mortgage-backed securities.
p44
aVBut they can also rate countries,
p45
aVand these ratings are called sovereign ratings,
p46
aVand I would like to focus in particular
p47
aVon these sovereign ratings.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,
p50
aVyou're thinking,
p51
aVso why should I really care about this, right?
p52
aVBe honest.
p53
aVWell, ratings affect you.
p54
aVThey affect all of us.
p55
aVIf a rating agency rates a country,
p56
aVit basically assesses and evaluates
p57
aVa country's debt
p58
aVand the ability and willingness of a country
p59
aVto repay its debt.
p60
aVSo if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,
p61
aVthe country has to pay more
p62
aVin order to borrow money
p63
aVon the international markets.
p64
aVSo it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,
p65
aVbecause you and your fellow countrymen
p66
aVhave to pony up more in order to borrow.
p67
aVBut what if a country can't afford to pay more
p68
aVbecause it's maybe too expensive?
p69
aVWell, then the country has less available
p70
aVfor other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.
p71
aVAnd this is the reason why you should care,
p72
aVbecause sovereign ratings affect everyone.
p73
aVAnd that is the reason why I believe
p74
aVthey should be defined as public goods.
p75
aVThey should be transparent, accessible,
p76
aVand available to everyone at no cost.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut here's the situation:
p79
aVthe rating agency market is dominated
p80
aVby three players and three players only \u2014
p81
aVStandard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch \u2014
p82
aVand we know whenever there is a market concentration,
p83
aVthere is really no competition.
p84
aVThere is no incentive to improve
p85
aVthe quality of your product.
p86
aVAnd let's face it, the credit rating  agencies have contributed,
p87
aVputting the global economy on the brink,
p88
aVand yet they have to change the way they operate.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe second point,
p91
aVwould you really buy a car
p92
aVjust based on the advice of the dealer?
p93
aVObviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.
p94
aVBut that's actually what's going on
p95
aVin the rating agency sector every single day.
p96
aVThe customers of these rating agencies,
p97
aVlike countries or companies,
p98
aVthey are paying for their own ratings,
p99
aVand obviously this is creating
p100
aVa conflict of interest.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe third point is,
p103
aVthe rating agencies are not really telling us
p104
aVhow they are coming up with their ratings,
p105
aVbut in this day and age,
p106
aVyou can't even sell a candy bar
p107
aVwithout listing everything that's inside.
p108
aVBut for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,
p109
aVwe really do not know
p110
aVwhat all the different ingredients are.
p111
aVWe are allowing the rating agencies
p112
aVto be intransparent about their work,
p113
aVand we need to change this.
p114
aa(lp115
VI think there is no doubt that the sector
p116
aVneeds a complete overhaul,
p117
aVnot just a trimming at the margins.
p118
aVI think it's time for a bold move.
p119
aVI think it's time to upgrade the system.
p120
aVAnd this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation
p121
aVhave invested a lot of time and effort
p122
aVthinking about an alternative for the sector.
p123
aVAnd we have developed the first model
p124
aVfor a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,
p125
aVand we call it by its acronym, INCRA.
p126
aa(lp127
VINCRA would make a difference
p128
aVto the current system
p129
aVby adding another nonprofit player to the mix.
p130
aVIt would be based on a nonprofit model
p131
aVthat would be based on a sustainable endowment.
p132
aVThe endowment would create income
p133
aVthat would allow us to run the operation,
p134
aVto run the rating agency,
p135
aVand it would also allow us
p136
aVto make our ratings publicly available.
p137
aVBut this is not enough to make a difference, right?
p138
aVINCRA would also be based on
p139
aVa very, very clear governance structure
p140
aVthat would avoid any conflict of interest,
p141
aVand it would include many stakeholders from society.
p142
aVINCRA would not only be a European
p143
aVor an American rating agency,
p144
aVit would be a truly international one,
p145
aVin which, in particular, the emerging economies
p146
aVwould have an equal interest,  voice and representation.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe second big difference that INCRA would make is
p149
aVthat would it base its sovereign risk assessment
p150
aVon a broader set of indicators.
p151
aVThink about it that way.
p152
aVIf we conduct a sovereign rating,
p153
aVwe basically take a look at
p154
aVthe economic soil of a country,
p155
aVits macroeconomic fundamentals.
p156
aVBut we also have to ask the question,
p157
aVwho is cultivating the economic soil
p158
aVof a country, right?
p159
aVWell, a country has many gardeners,
p160
aVand one of them is the government,
p161
aVso we have to ask the question,
p162
aVhow is a country governed?
p163
aVHow is it managed?
p164
aVAnd this is the reason why we have developed
p165
aVwhat we call forward-looking indicators.
p166
aVThese are indicators that give you
p167
aVa much better read about
p168
aVthe socioeconomic development of a country.
p169
aVI hope you would agree it's important for you to know
p170
aVif your government is willing to invest  in renewable energy and education.
p171
aVIt's important for you to know
p172
aVif the government of your country
p173
aVis able to manage a crisis,
p174
aVif the government is finally able to implement
p175
aVthe reforms that it's promised.
p176
aVFor example, if INCRA would rate
p177
aVSouth Africa right now,
p178
aVof course we would take a very, very close look
p179
aVat the youth unemployment of the country,
p180
aVthe highest in the world.
p181
aVIf over 70 percent of a country's population
p182
aVunder the age of 35 is unemployed,
p183
aVof course this has a huge impact on the economy
p184
aVtoday and even more so in the future.
p185
aVWell, our friends at Moody's,
p186
aVStandard & Poor's, and Fitch will tell us
p187
aVwe would take this into account as well.
p188
aVBut guess what? We do not know
p189
aVexactly how they will take this into account.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd this leads me to the third big difference
p192
aVthat INCRA would make.
p193
aVINCRA would not only release its ratings
p194
aVbut it would also release its indicators
p195
aVand methodology.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo in contrast to the current system,
p198
aVINCRA would be fully transparent.
p199
aVSo in a nutshell,
p200
aVINCRA would offer an alternative
p201
aVto the current system of the big three rating agencies
p202
aVby adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix
p203
aVthat would increase the competition,
p204
aVit would increase the transparency of the sector,
p205
aVand it would also increase the quality.
p206
aa(lp207
VI can tell that sovereign ratings
p208
aVmay still look to you like this very small piece
p209
aVof this very complex global financial world,
p210
aVbut I tell you it's a very important one,
p211
aVand a very important one to fix,
p212
aVbecause sovereign ratings affect all of us,
p213
aVand they should be addressed and should be defined
p214
aVas public goods.
p215
aVAnd this is why we are testing our model right now,
p216
aVand why we are trying to find out if it can
p217
aVbring together a group of able and willing actors
p218
aVto bring INCRA to life.
p219
aVI truly believe building up INCRA
p220
aVis in everyone's interest,
p221
aVand that we have the unique opportunity right now
p222
aVto turn INCRA into a cornerstone
p223
aVof a new, more inclusive financial system.
p224
aVBecause for way too long,
p225
aVwe have left the big financial players on their own.
p226
aVIt's time to give them some company.
p227
