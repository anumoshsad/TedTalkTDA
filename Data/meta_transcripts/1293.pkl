V(Singing) I see the moon. The moon sees me.
p4
aVThe moon sees somebody that I don't see.
p5
aVGod bless the moon, and God bless me.
p6
aVAnd God bless the somebody that I don't see.
p7
aVIf I get to heaven, before you do,
p8
aVI'll make a hole and pull you through.
p9
aVAnd I'll write your name on every star,
p10
aVand that way the world
p11
aVwon't seem so far.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe astronaut will not be at work today.
p14
aVHe has called in sick.
p15
aVHe has turned off his cell phone, his laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.
p16
aVThere is a fat yellow cat asleep on his couch,
p17
aVraindrops against the window
p18
aVand not even the hint of coffee in the kitchen air.
p19
aVEverybody is in a tizzy.
p20
aVThe engineers on the 15th floor have stopped working on their particle machine.
p21
aVThe anti-gravity room is leaking,
p22
aVand even the freckled kid with glasses,
p23
aVwhose only job is to take out the trash, is nervous,
p24
aVfumbles the bag, spills a banana peel and a paper cup.
p25
aVNobody notices.
p26
aVThey are too busy recalculating what this all mean for lost time.
p27
aVHow many galaxies are we losing per second?
p28
aVHow long before next rocket can be launched?
p29

V(Applause)
p44
aa(lp45
VThank you.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhen I was little, I could not understand the concept
p48
aVthat you could only live one life.
p49
aVI don't mean this metaphorically.
p50
aVI mean, I literally thought that I was going to get to do
p51
aVeverything there was to do
p52
aVand be everything there was to be.
p53
aVIt was only a matter of time.
p54
aVAnd there was no limitation based on age or gender
p55
aVor race or even appropriate time period.
p56
aVI was sure that I was going to actually experience
p57
aVwhat it felt like to be a leader of the civil rights movement
p58
aVor a ten-year old boy living on a farm during the dust bowl
p59
aVor an emperor of the Tang dynasty in China.
p60
aVMy mom says that when people asked me
p61
aVwhat I wanted to be when I grew up, my typical response was:
p62
aVprincess-ballerina-astronaut.
p63
aVAnd what she doesn't understand is that I wasn't trying to invent
p64
aVsome combined super profession.
p65
aVI was listing things I thought I was gonna get to be:
p66
aVa princess and a ballerina and an astronaut.
p67
aVand I'm pretty sure the list probably went on from there.
p68
aVI usually just got cut off.
p69
aVIt was never a question of if I was gonna get to do something
p70
aVso much of a question of when.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd I was sure that if I was going to do everything,
p73
aVthat it probably meant I had to move pretty quickly,
p74
aVbecause there was a lot of stuff I needed to do.
p75
aVSo my life was constantly in a state of rushing.
p76
aVI was always scared that I was falling behind.
p77
aVAnd since I grew up in New York City, as far as I could tell,
p78
aVrushing was pretty normal.
p79
aVBut, as I grew up, I had this sinking realization,
p80
aVthat I wasn't gonna get to live any more than one life.
p81
aVI only knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl
p82
aVin New York City,
p83
aVnot a teenage boy in New Zealand,
p84
aVnot a prom queen in Kansas.
p85
aVI only got to see through my lens.
p86
aVAnd it was around this time that I became obsessed with stories,
p87
aVbecause it was through stories that I was able to see
p88
aVthrough someone else's lens, however briefly or imperfectly.
p89
aVAnd I started craving hearing other people's experiences
p90
aVbecause I was so jealous that there were entire lives
p91
aVthat I was never gonna get to live,
p92
aVand I wanted to hear about everything that I was missing.
p93
aVAnd by transitive property,
p94
aVI realized that some people were never gonna get to experience
p95
aVwhat it felt like to be a teenage girl in New York city.
p96
aVWhich meant that they weren't gonna know
p97
aVwhat the subway ride after your first kiss feels like,
p98
aVor how quiet it gets when its snows.
p99
aVAnd I wanted them to know, I wanted to tell them.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd this became the focus of my obsession.
p102
aVI busied myself telling stories and sharing stories and collecting them.
p103
aVAnd it's not until recently
p104
aVthat I realized that I can't always rush poetry.
p105
aVIn April for National Poetry Month, there's this challenge
p106
aVthat many poets in the poetry community participate in,
p107
aVand its called the 30/30 Challenge.
p108
aVThe idea is you write a new poem
p109
aVevery single day for the entire month of April.
p110
aVAnd last year, I tried it for the first time
p111
aVand was thrilled by the efficiency at which I was able to produce poetry.
p112
aVBut at the end of the month, I looked back at these 30 poems I had written
p113
aVand discovered that they were all trying to tell the same story,
p114
aVit had just taken me 30 tries to figure out the way that it wanted to be told.
p115
aVAnd I realized that this is probably true of other stories on an even larger scale.
p116
aVI have stories that I have tried to tell for years,
p117
aVrewriting and rewriting and constantly searching for the right words.
p118
aa(lp119
VThere's a French poet and essayist by the name of Paul Valéry
p120
aVwho said a poem is never finished, it is only abandoned.
p121
aVAnd this terrifies me
p122
aVbecause it implies that I could keep re-editing and rewriting forever
p123
aVand its up to me to decide when a poem is finished
p124
aVand when I can walk away from it.
p125
aVAnd this goes directly against my very obsessive nature
p126
aVto try to find the right answer and the perfect words and the right form.
p127
aVAnd I use poetry in my life,
p128
aVas a way to help me navigate and work through things.
p129
aVBut just because I end the poem, doesn't mean that I've solved
p130
aVwhat it was I was puzzling through.
p131
aVI like to revisit old poetry
p132
aVbecause it shows me exactly where I was at that moment
p133
aVand what it was I was trying to navigate
p134
aVand the words that I chose to help me.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, I have a story
p137
aVthat I've been stumbling over for years and years
p138
aVand I'm not sure if I've found the prefect form,
p139
aVor whether this is just one attempt
p140
aVand I will try to rewrite it later in search of a better way to tell it.
p141
aVBut I do know that later, when I look back
p142
aVI will be able to know that this is where I was at this moment
p143
aVand this is what I was trying to navigate,
p144
aVwith these words, here, in this room, with you.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo \u2014
p147
aVSmile.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt didn't always work this way.
p150
aVThere's a time you had to get your hands dirty.
p151
aVWhen you were in the dark, for most of it, fumbling was a given.
p152
aVIf you needed more contrast, more saturation,
p153
aVdarker darks and brighter brights,
p154
aVthey called it extended development.
p155
aVIt meant you spent longer inhaling chemicals, longer up to your wrist.
p156
aVIt wasn't always easy.
p157
aVGrandpa Stewart was a Navy photographer.
p158
aVYoung, red-faced with his sleeves rolled up,
p159
aVfists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,
p160
aVhe looked like Popeye the sailor man come to life.
p161
aVCrooked smile, tuft of chest hair,
p162
aVhe showed up to World War II, with a smirk and a hobby.
p163
aVWhen they asked him if he knew much about photography,
p164
aVhe lied, learned to read Europe like a map,
p165
aVupside down, from the height of a fighter plane,
p166
aVcamera snapping, eyelids flapping
p167
aVthe darkest darks and brightest brights.
p168
aVHe learned war like he could read his way home.
p169
aa(lp170
VWhen other men returned, they would put their weapons out to rest,
p171
aVbut he brought the lenses and the cameras home with him.
p172
aVOpened a shop, turned it into a family affair.
p173
aVMy father was born into this world of black and white.
p174
aVHis basketball hands learned the tiny clicks and slides
p175
aVof lens into frame, film into camera,
p176
aVchemical into plastic bin.
p177
aVHis father knew the equipment but not the art.
p178
aVHe knew the darks but not the brights.
p179
aVMy father learned the magic, spent his time following light.
p180
aVOnce he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire,
p181
aVhunted it with his camera for a week.
p182
aV"Follow the light," he said.
p183
aV"Follow the light."
p184
aa(lp185
VThere are parts of me I only recognize from photographs.
p186
aVThe loft on Wooster Street with the creaky hallways,
p187
aVthe twelve-foot ceilings, white walls and cold floors.
p188
aVThis was my mother's home, before she was mother.
p189
aVBefore she was wife, she was artist.
p190
aVAnd the only two rooms in the house,
p191
aVwith walls that reached all the way up to the ceiling,
p192
aVand doors that opened and closed,
p193
aVwere the bathroom and the darkroom.
p194
aVThe darkroom she built herself,
p195
aVwith custom-made stainless steel sinks, an 8x10 bed enlarger
p196
aVthat moved up and down by a giant hand crank,
p197
aVa bank of color-balanced lights,
p198
aVa white glass wall for viewing prints,
p199
aVa drying rack that moved in and out from the wall.
p200
aVMy mother built herself a darkroom.
p201
aVMade it her home.
p202
aVFell in love with a man with basketball hands,
p203
aVwith the way he looked at light.
p204
aa(lp205
VThey got married. Had a baby.
p206
aVMoved to a house near a park.
p207
aVBut they kept the loft on Wooster Street
p208
aVfor birthday parties and treasure hunts.
p209
aVThe baby tipped the grayscale,
p210
aVfilled her parents' photo albums with red balloons and yellow icing.
p211
aVThe baby grew into a girl without freckles,
p212
aVwith a crooked smile,
p213
aVwho didn\u2019t understand why her friends did not have darkrooms in their houses,
p214
aVwho never saw her parents kiss,
p215
aVwho never saw them hold hands.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut one day, another baby showed up.
p218
aVThis one with perfect straight hair and bubble gum cheeks.
p219
aVThey named him sweet potato.
p220
aVWhen he laughed, he laughed so loudly
p221
aVhe scared the pigeons on the fire escape
p222
aVAnd the four of them lived in that house near the park.
p223
aVThe girl with no freckles, the sweet potato boy,
p224
aVthe basketball father and darkroom mother
p225
aVand they lit their candles and said their prayers,
p226
aVand the corners of the photographs curled.
p227
aa(lp228
VOne day, some towers fell.
p229
aVAnd the house near the park became a house under ash, so they escaped
p230
aVin backpacks, on bicycles to darkrooms
p231
aVBut the loft of Wooster Street was built for an artist,
p232
aVnot a family of pigeons,
p233
aVand walls that do not reach the ceiling do not hold in the yelling
p234
aVand the man with basketball hands put his weapons out to rest.
p235
aVHe could not fight this war, and no maps pointed home.
p236
aVHis hands no longer fit his camera,
p237
aVno longer fit his wife's,
p238
aVno longer fit his body.
p239
aVThe sweet potato boy mashed his fists into his mouth
p240
aVuntil he had nothing more to say.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo, the girl without freckles went treasure hunting on her own.
p243
aVAnd on Wooster Street, in a building with the creaky hallways
p244
aVand the loft with the 12-foot ceilings
p245
aVand the darkroom with too many sinks
p246
aVunder the color-balanced lights, she found a note,
p247
aVtacked to the wall with a thumb-tack, left over from a time before towers,
p248
aVfrom the time before babies.
p249
aVAnd the note said: "A guy sure loves the girl who works in the darkroom."
p250
aVIt was a year before my father picked up a camera again.
p251
aVHis first time out, he followed the Christmas lights,
p252
aVdotting their way through New York City's trees,
p253
aVtiny dots of light, blinking out at him from out of the darkest darks.
p254
aa(lp255
VA year later he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire
p256
aVstayed for a week hunting it with his camera,
p257
aVit was ravaging the West Coast
p258
aVeating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.
p259
aVOn the other side of the country,
p260
aVI went to class and wrote a poem in the margins of my notebook.
p261
aVWe have both learned the art of capture.
p262
aVMaybe we are learning the art of embracing.
p263
aVMaybe we are learning the art of letting go.
