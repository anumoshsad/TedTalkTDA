aa(lp13
VThank you very much.
p14
aVThat was whistling.
p15
aVI'm trying to do this in English.
p16
aVWhat is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland \u2014
p17
aVwhy is he whistling?
p18
aVWell actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four.
p19
aVMy dad was always whistling around the house,
p20
aVand I just thought that's part of communication in my family.
p21
aVSo I whistled along with him.
p22
aVAnd actually, until I was 34,
p23
aVI always annoyed and irritated people with whistling,
p24
aVbecause, to be honest,
p25
aVmy whistling is a kind of deviant behavior.
p26
aVI whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom,
p27
aVI whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party
p30
aVwith my family-in-law.
p31
aVAnd they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music.
p32
aVAnd when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo when "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" \u2014 you know it?
p37
aa(lp38
V(Whistling)
p39
aa(lp40
VBut it can also sound like this.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Whistling)
p43
aa(lp44
VBut during a Christmas party \u2014
p45
aVat dinner, actually \u2014 it's very annoying.
p46
aVSo my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling."
p47
aVAnd I just couldn't.
p48
aVAnd at one point \u2014
p49
aVand I had some wine, I have to admit that \u2014
p50
aVat one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join."
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd two weeks later,
p53
aVI received a text message: "You're going to America."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, OK, I'm going to America.
p58
aVI would love to, but why?
p59
aVSo I immediately called her up, of course.
p60
aVShe googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship
p61
aVin America, of course.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VShe didn't expect me to go there.
p66
aVAnd I would have lost my face.
p67
aVI don't know if that's correct English.
p68
aVBut the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VI lost my face.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd she thought, "He will never go there."
p77
aVBut actually, I did.
p78
aVSo I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States,
p79
aVand I entered the world of whistling.
p80
aVAnd I also entered the World Championship,
p81
aVand I won there, in 2004.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VThat was great fun, of course.
p86
aVAnd to defend my title \u2014 like judokas do and sportsmen \u2014
p87
aVI thought, well let's go back in 2005 \u2014
p88
aVand I won again.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VThen I couldn't participate for a few years.
p93
aVAnd in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.
p94
aVSo what happened now
p95
aVis I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage,
p96
aVand I'm talking about whistling.
p97
aVAnd actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment.
p98
aVSo I quit my day job as a nurse.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I try to live my dream \u2014
p103
aVwell, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VOK, I'm not the only one whistling here.
p108
aVYou say, "Huh, what do you mean?"
p109
aVWell actually, you are going to whistle along.
p110
aVAnd then always the same thing happens:
p111
aVpeople are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God.
p112
aVWhy? Can I go away?"
p113
aVNo, you can't.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VActually, it's very simple.
p118
aVThe track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."
p119
aVIt's about 80 minutes long.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VNo, no, no. It's four minutes long.
p124
aVAnd I want to first rehearse with you your whistling.
p125
aVYes, so I whistle the tone.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Whistling)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VSorry, I forgot one thing \u2014
p132
aVyou whistle the same tone as me.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI heard a wide variety of tones.
p137
aa(lp138

aa(lp142
VThis is very promising.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is very promising.
p147
aVI'll ask the technicians to start the music.
p148
aVAnd if it's started, I just point where you whistle along,
p149
aVand we will see what happens.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VOh, I'm so sorry, technicians.
