(lp3
VIt's really, really great to be here.
p4
aVYou have the power to change the world.
p5
aVI\u2019m not saying that to be cliché,
p6
aVyou really have the power to change the world.
p7
aVDeep inside of you, every single one of you
p8
aVhas the most powerful device known to man.
p9
aVAnd that's an idea.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo a single idea, from the human mind,
p12
aVit could start a groundswell,
p13
aVit could be a flash point for a movement
p14
aVand it can actually rewrite our future.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut an idea is powerless
p17
aVif it stays inside of you.
p18
aVIf you never pull that idea out for others to contend with,
p19
aVit will die with you.
p20
aVNow, maybe some of you guys have tried to convey your idea
p21
aVand it wasn't adopted, it was rejected,
p22
aVand some other mediocre or average idea was adopted.
p23
aVAnd the only difference between those two is in the way it was communicated.
p24
aVBecause if you communicate an idea in a way that resonates,
p25
aVchange will happen, and you can change the world.
p26
aa(lp27
VIn my family, we collect these vintage European posters.
p28
aVEvery time we go to Maui, we go to the dealer there,
p29
aVand he turns these great big posters.
p30
aVI love them. They all have one idea
p31
aVand one really clear visual that conveys the idea.
p32
aVThey are about the size of a mattress. They're really big.
p33
aVThey're not as thick as a mattress, but they're big.
p34
aVAnd the guy will tell the story as he turns the pages.
p35
aVAnd this one time I was flanked by my two kids
p36
aVand he turns the page and this poster is underneath,
p37
aVand right when I lean forward and say,
p38
aV"Oh my God, I love this poster,"
p39
aVboth of my kids jumped back and they are like,
p40
aV"Oh my God, mom, it's you."
p41
aVAnd this is the poster.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSee, I'm like "Fire it up!"
p46
aa(lp47
VThe thing I loved about this poster was the irony.
p48
aVHere's this chick all fired up, headed into battle \u2014
p49
aVas the standard bearer \u2014
p50
aVand she's holding these little Suavitos baking spices,
p51
aVlike something so seemingly insignificant,
p52
aVthough she's willing to risk, you know, life and limb to promote this thing.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo if you are to swap out those little Suavitos baking spices
p55
aVwith a presentation \u2014
p56
aVYeah, it's me, pretty fired up.
p57
aVI was fired up about presentations
p58
aVback when it wasn't cool to be fired up about presentations.
p59
aVI really think they have the power to change the world
p60
aVwhen you communicate effectively through them.
p61
aVAnd changing the world is hard.
p62
aVIt won't happen with just one person with one single idea.
p63
aVThat idea has got to spread, or it won't be effective.
p64
aVSo it has to come out of you
p65
aVand out into the open for people to see.
p66
aVAnd the way that ideas are conveyed the most effectively is through story.
p67
aa(lp68
VYou know, for thousands of years,
p69
aVilliterate generations would pass on their values and their culture
p70
aVfrom generation to generation,
p71
aVand they would stay intact.
p72
aVSo there's something kind of magical about a story structure
p73
aVthat makes it so that when it's assembled,
p74
aVit can be ingested and then recalled
p75
aVby the person who's receiving it.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo basically a story, you get a physical reaction;
p78
aVyour heart can race, your eyes can dilate,
p79
aVyou could talk about, "Oh, I got a chill down my spine"
p80
aVor, "I could feel it in the pit of my stomach."
p81
aVWe actually physically react when someone is telling us a story.
p82
aVSo even though the stage is the same, a story can be told,
p83
aVbut once a presentation is told, it completely flatlines.
p84
aVAnd I wanted to figure out why.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhy is it that we physically sit with rapt attention during a story,
p87
aVbut it just dies for a presentation.
p88
aVSo I wanted to figure out, how do you incorporate story into presentations.
p89
aVSo we've had thousands of presentations back at the shop \u2014
p90
aVhundreds of thousands of presentations, actually,
p91
aVso I knew the context of a really bad presentation.
p92
aVI decided to study cinema and literature,
p93
aVand really dig in and figure out what was going on
p94
aVand why it was broken.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, I want to show you some of the findings
p97
aVthat led up to what I've uncovered as a presentation form.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo it was obvious to start with Aristotle,
p100
aVhe had a three-act structure, a beginning, a middle and an end.
p101
aVWe studied poetics and rhetoric,
p102
aVand a lot of presentations don't even have that in its most simple form.
p103
aVAnd then when I moved on to studying hero archetypes,
p104
aVI thought, "OK, the presenter is the hero,
p105
aVthey're up on the stage, they're the star of the show."
p106
aVIt's easy to feel, as the presenter, that you're the star of the show.
p107
aVI realized right away, that that's really broken.
p108
aVBecause I have an idea, I can put it out there,
p109
aVbut if you guys don't grab that idea and hold it as dear,
p110
aVthe idea goes nowhere and the world is never changed.
p111
aVSo in reality, the presenter isn't the hero,
p112
aVthe audience is the hero of our idea.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo if you look at Joseph Campbell's hero's journey,
p115
aVjust in the front part, there were some really interesting insights there.
p116
aVSo there is this likable hero in an ordinary world,
p117
aVand they get this call to adventure.
p118
aVSo the world is kind of brought out of balance.
p119
aVAnd at first they're resistant.
p120
aVThey're like, "I don't know if I want to jump into this,"
p121
aVand then a mentor comes along
p122
aVand helps them move from their ordinary world
p123
aVinto a special world.
p124
aVAnd that's the role of the presenter.
p125
aVIt's to be the mentor. You're not Luke Skywalker, you're Yoda.
p126
aVYou're the one that actually helps the audience
p127
aVmove from one thing and into your new special idea,
p128
aVand that's the power of a story.
p129
aVSo in its most simple structure, it's a three-part structure of a story.
p130
aVYou have a likable hero who has a desire,
p131
aVthey encounter a roadblock
p132
aVand ultimately they emerge, transform, and that's the basic structure.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut it wasn't until I came across a Gustav Freytag's pyramid \u2014
p135
aVhe drew this shape in 1863.
p136
aVNow, he was a German dramatist ...
p137
aVhe was a German dramatist
p138
aVand he believed there is a five-act structure,
p139
aVwhich has an exposition, a rising action,
p140
aVa climax, a falling action and a denouement,
p141
aVwhich is the unraveling or the resolution of the story.
p142
aVI love this shape. So we talk about shapes.
p143
aVA story has an arc \u2014 well, an arc is a shape.
p144
aVWe talk about classical music having a shapeliness to it.
p145
aVSo I thought, hey, if presentations had a shape,
p146
aVwhat would that shape be?
p147
aVAnd how did the greatest communicators use that shape,
p148
aVor do they use a shape?
p149
aa(lp150
VSo I'll never forget, it was a Saturday morning.
p151
aVAfter all this study \u2014 it was a couple of years of study \u2014
p152
aVI drew a shape.
p153
aVAnd I was like, "Oh my gosh, if this shape is real,
p154
aVI should be able to take two completely different presentations
p155
aVand overlay it, and it should be true."
p156
aa(lp157
VSo I took the obvious,
p158
aVI took Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech,
p159
aVand I took Steve Jobs' 2007 iPhone launch speech,
p160
aVI overlaid it over it, and it worked.
p161
aVI sat in my office, just astounded.
p162
aVI actually cried a little,
p163
aVbecause I was like, "I've been given this gift,"
p164
aVand here it is,
p165
aVthis is the shape of a great presentation.
p166
aVIsn't it amazing?
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI was crying.
p171
aVI want to walk you through it, it's pretty astounding.
p172
aVThere is a beginning, a middle and an end, and I want to walk you through it.
p173
aVBecause the greatest communicators \u2014 I went through speeches, everything \u2014
p174
aVI can overlay the shape.
p175
aVEven the Gettysburg Address follows the shape.
p176
aa(lp177
VAt the beginning of any presentation, you need to establish what is.
p178
aVYou know, here's the status quo, here's what's going on.
p179
aVAnd then you need to compare that to what could be.
p180
aVYou need to make that gap as big as possible,
p181
aVbecause there is this commonplace of the status quo,
p182
aVand you need to contrast that with the loftiness of your idea.
p183
aVSo it's like, you know, here's the past, here's the present,
p184
aVbut look at our future.
p185
aVHere's a problem, but look at that problem removed.
p186
aVHere's a roadblock, let's annihilate the roadblock.
p187
aVYou need to really amplify that gap.
p188
aVThis would be like the inciting incident in a movie.
p189
aVThat's when suddenly the audience has to contend
p190
aVwith what you just put out there:
p191
aV"Wow, do I want to agree with this and align with it or not?"
p192
aVAnd in the rest of your presentation should support that.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo the middle goes back and forth,
p195
aVit traverses between what is and what could be,
p196
aVwhat is and what could be.
p197
aVBecause what you are trying to do
p198
aVis make the status quo and the normal unappealing,
p199
aVand you're wanting to draw them
p200
aVtowards what could be in the future with your idea adopted.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, on your way to change the world, people are going to resist.
p203
aVThey're not going to be excited, they may love the world the way it is.
p204
aVSo you'll encounter resistance.
p205
aVThat's why you have to move back and forth.
p206
aVIt's similar to sailing.
p207
aVWhen you're sailing against the wind and there is wind resistance,
p208
aVyou have to move your boat back and forth, and back and forth.
p209
aVThat's so you can capture the wind.
p210
aVYou have to actually capture the resistance
p211
aVcoming against you when you're sailing.
p212
aVNow interesting, if you capture the wind just right
p213
aVand you set your sail just right,
p214
aVyour ship will actually sail faster than the wind itself.
p215
aVIt is a physics phenomenon.
p216
aVSo by planting in there
p217
aVthe way they're going to resist between what is and what can be,
p218
aVis actually going to draw them towards your idea
p219
aVquicker than should you not do that.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo after you've moved back and forth between what is and what could be,
p222
aVthe last turning point is a call to action,
p223
aVwhich every presentation should have, but at the very end.
p224
aVYou need to describe the world as a new bliss.
p225
aV"This is utopia with my idea adopted."
p226
aV"This is the way the world is going to look,
p227
aVwhen we join together and we solve this big problem."
p228
aVYou need to use that as your ending,
p229
aVin a very poetic and dramatic way.
p230
aVSo, interestingly, when I was done,
p231
aVI was like, "You know what? I could use this as an analysis tool."
p232
aa(lp233
VI actually transcribe speeches,
p234
aVand I would actually map out, how much they map to this tool.
p235
aVSo I want to show you some of that today,
p236
aVand I want to start with the very two people
p237
aVthat I used when I first did.
p238
aa(lp239
VHere's Mr. Jobs, has completely changed the world.
p240
aVChanged the world of personal computing, changed the music industry
p241
aVand now he's on his way to change the mobile device industry.
p242
aVSo he's definitely changed the world.
p243
aVAnd this is the shape of his iPhone launch 2007,
p244
aVwhen he launched his iPhone.
p245
aa(lp246
VIt's a 90-minute talk and you can see he starts with what is,
p247
aVtraverses back and forth and ends with what could be.
p248
aVSo I want to zoom in on this:
p249
aVthe white line is him speaking, he's talking.
p250
aVThe next color line you'll see popped up there,
p251
aVthat's when he cuts to video.
p252
aVSo he's adding some variety and he cuts to demo.
p253
aVSo it's not just him talking the whole time.
p254
aVAnd these lines are representative there.
p255
aVAnd then towards the end you'll see a blue line,
p256
aVwhich will be the guest speaker.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo this is where it gets kind of interesting:
p259
aVevery tick mark here is when he made them laugh.
p260
aVAnd every tick mark here is when he made them clap.
p261
aVThey are so involved physically,
p262
aVthey are physically reacting to what he is saying,
p263
aVwhich is actually fantastic,
p264
aVbecause then you know you have the audience in your hand.
p265
aVSo he kicks off what could be with,
p266
aV"This is a day I've been looking forward to for two and a half years."
p267
aVSo he is launching a product
p268
aVthat he's known about already for a couple of years.
p269
aVSo this is not a new product to him.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut look at this,
p272
aVhe does this other thing: he marvels.
p273
aVHe marvels at his own product.
p274
aVHe marvels himself more than the audience laughs or claps.
p275
aVSo he is like, "Isn't this awesome? Isn't this beautiful?"
p276
aVHe is modeling for the audience what he wants them to feel.
p277
aVSo he is actually doing a job of compelling them to feel a certain way.
p278
aVSo he kicks off with what could be with, "Every once in a while,
p279
aVa revolutionary product comes along that changes everything."
p280
aVSo he starts to kick in and talk about his new product.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, at the beginning of it, he actually keeps the phone off.
p283
aVYou'll see that the line is pretty white up until this point,
p284
aVso he goes off between,
p285
aV"Here's this new phone, and here's the sucky competitors.
p286
aVHere's this new phone, and here's the sucky competitors."
p287
aVAnd then, right about here, he has the star moment \u2014
p288
aVand that something we'll always remember.
p289
aVHe turns the phone on.
p290
aVThe audience sees scrolling for the first time,
p291
aVyou can hear the oxygen sucked out of the room.
p292
aVThey gasped. You can actually hear it.
p293
aVSo he creates a moment that they'll always remember.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo if we move along this model, you can see the blue,
p296
aVwhere the external speakers are going,
p297
aVand towards the bottom right, the line breaks.
p298
aVThat's because his clicker broke.
p299
aVHe wants to keep this heightened sense of excitement.
p300
aVHe tells a personal story,
p301
aVright there, where the technology didn't work.
p302
aVSo he's the master communicator,
p303
aVand he turns to story to keep the audience involved.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo the top right he ends with the new bliss.
p306
aVHe leaves them with the promise
p307
aVthat Apple will continue to build revolutionary new products.
p308
aVAnd he says,
p309
aV"There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love:
p310
aV'I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.'
p311
aVWe've always tried to do that at Apple since the very beginning
p312
aVand we always will."
p313
aVSo he ends with the new bliss.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo let's look at Mr. King.
p316
aVHe was an amazing visionary, a clergyman
p317
aVwho spent his life working hard for equality.
p318
aVAnd this is the shape of the "I Have a Dream" speech.
p319
aa(lp320
VYou can see he starts with what is,
p321
aVmoves back and forth between what is and what could be,
p322
aVand ends with a very poetic new bliss, which is the famous part we all know.
p323
aVSo I'm going to spread it out a little bit here,
p324
aVstretch it for you,
p325
aVand what I'm doing here is I put the actual transcript there
p326
aValong with the text.
p327
aVI know you can't read it.
p328
aVBut at the end of every line break, I broke the line,
p329
aVbecause he took a breath and he paused.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow he was a Southern Baptist preacher, most people hadn't heard that,
p332
aVso he had a real cadence and a rhythm that was really new for people there.
p333
aVSo I want to cover up these lines of text with a bar
p334
aVbecause I want to use this bar as an information device here.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo let's walk through how he actually spoke to the people.
p337
aVThe blue bars here are going to be when he used
p338
aVthe actual rhetorical device of repetition.
p339
aVSo he was repeating himself,
p340
aVhe was using the same words and phrases,
p341
aVso people could remember and recall them.
p342
aVBut then he also used a lot of metaphors and visual words.
p343
aVThis was a way to take really complicated ideas
p344
aVand make them memorable and knowledgeable, so people got it.
p345
aVHe actually created very \u2014
p346
aValmost like scenes with his words to make it
p347
aVso they could envision what he was saying.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd then there were also a lot of familiar songs and scriptures that he used.
p350
aVThis is just the front end of it that you're seeing.
p351
aVAnd then he also made a lot of political references
p352
aVof the promises that were made to the people.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo if we look at the very first end of what is,
p355
aVat the very end of what is was the very first time
p356
aVthat people actually clapped and roared really loud.
p357
aVSo the end of what is what he did is he said,
p358
aV"America has given the Negro people a bad check,
p359
aVa check which has come back marked insufficient funds."
p360
aVWell, everyone knows what it's like to not have money in your account.
p361
aVSo he used the metaphor people were very familiar with.
p362
aVBut when they really charged up,
p363
aVthe very first time they really screamed was:
p364
aV"So we have come to cash this check,
p365
aVa check that will give us upon demand
p366
aVthe riches of freedom and the security of justice."
p367
aVThat's when they really clapped.
p368
aVIt was when he compared what currently is to what could be.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo when we move along a little farther in the model,
p371
aVyou'll see it goes back and forth at a more frenzied pace.
p372
aVAnd this is when he goes back and forth, and back and forth.
p373
aVNow the audience was in a frenzy.
p374
aVThey were all excited, and so you can actually do this
p375
aVto keep them in a heightened sense of excitement.
p376
aVSo he says, "I have a dream
p377
aVthat one day this nation will rise up and live out the meaning of its creed.
p378
aV'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'"
p379
aVSo he uses the little orange text there to remind them of the promise
p380
aVthat the politicians had made to him or that this country had made.
p381
aVThen he moves back and forth between
p382
aV"I have a dream that one day, I have a dream that one day,
p383
aVI have a dream that one day,"
p384
aVand at the end, it gets really interesting.
p385
aVBecause he uses \u2014 you can look at the four shades of green,
p386
aVthere's a lot of blue there, which was a lot of repetition \u2014
p387
aVhe had a heightened sense of repetition.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd the green was a heightened sense of songs and scriptures.
p390
aVSo the first batch of green
p391
aVwas the actual scripture from the Book of Isaiah.
p392
aVThe second batch of green was "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."
p393
aVNow, that's a familiar song that was specifically very significant
p394
aVfor the black people at the time,
p395
aVbecause this song was the song they chose to change the words to as an outcry,
p396
aVsaying that promises had not been kept.
p397
aVSo the third batch of green was actually a stanza from "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."
p398
aVAnd then the fourth was a Negro spiritual.
p399
aV"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last!"
p400
aa(lp401
VSo what he did is he actually reached inside of the hearts of the audience.
p402
aVHe pulled from scriptures, which is important.
p403
aVHe pulled from songs that they'd sung together
p404
aVas an outcry against this outrage,
p405
aVand he used those as a device to connect and resonate with the audience.
p406
aVEnding \u2014 painting a picture of this new bliss,
p407
aVusing the very things inside of them that they already held as sacred.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo he was a great man. He had a big, big dream.
p410
aVThere's a lot of people here, you guys have really big dreams.
p411
aVYou have really big ideas inside of you
p412
aVthat you need to get out.
p413
aVBut you know what? We encounter hardships.
p414
aVIt's not easy to change the world;
p415
aVit's a big job.
p416
aVYou know he was \u2014
p417
aVhis house was bombed, he was stabbed with a letter opener,
p418
aVultimately, he lost his life,
p419
aVyou know, for what he cared about.
p420
aVBut a lot of us aren't going to be required to pay that kind of sacrifice.
p421
aVBut what happens is
p422
aVthat it basically is a little bit like that basic story structure.
p423
aVLife can be like that.
p424
aa(lp425
VYou know, you guys are all likable people,
p426
aVyou have a desire, you encounter roadblocks,
p427
aVand we stop there.
p428
aVWe're just like, you know, "I had this idea,
p429
aVbut I'm not going to put it out there.
p430
aVIt's been rejected."
p431
aVYou know, we self-sabotage our own ideas,
p432
aVwe just butt up against the roadblocks and butt up against the roadblocks
p433
aVinstead of choosing to let the struggle transform us
p434
aVand choosing to go ahead and have a dream and make it real.
p435
aVAnd you know, if anyone \u2014 if I can do this, anybody can do this.

VI was raised in an economically and emotionally starved environment.
p438
aVFirst time I got to go to a camp with my sister, I was abused.
p439
aVWasn't the first time I was abused, it was just the most aggressive.
p440
aVAnd my mom and dad \u2014 they married each other three times,
p441
aa(lp442
V(Audience murmurs)
p443
aa(lp444
VYeah, that was tumultuous, and when they weren't fighting
p445
aVthey were helping sober up some alcoholic that was living with us
p446
aVbecause they were both sober alcoholics.
p447
aVSo my mom abandoned us when I was sixteen years old.
p448
aVAnd I took on a role of caretaker of my home and of my siblings.
p449
aVAnd I married. I met a man.
p450
aVFell in love. I went to a year of college.
p451
aVI did what every single, bright, young girl should do \u2014
p452
aVI got married when I was eighteen years old.
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd you know what?
p455
aVI knew, I knew
p456
aVthat I was born for more than this.
p457
aVAnd right at the point in the story of my life I had a choice.
p458
aVI could let all these things push me down
p459
aVand I could let all my ideas die inside of me.
p460
aVI could just say, you know, life is too hard to change the world.
p461
aVIt's just too tough.
p462
aVBut I chose a different story for my life.
p463
aa(lp464
V(Laughter)
p465
aa(lp466
VDon't you know it?
p467
aVAnd so I feel like there's people in this room \u2014
p468
aVyou got those little Suavitos baking spices
p469
aVand you're just like, "You know, It's not that big a deal."
p470
aV"It's really not the whole world I can change."
p471
aVBut you know, you can change your world.
p472
aVYou can change your life.
p473
aVYou can change the world that you have control over,
p474
aVyou can change your sphere.
p475
aVI want to encourage you to do that.
p476
aVBecause you know what?
p477
aVThe future isn't a place that we're going to go.
p478
aVIt's a place that you get to create.
p479
aa(lp480
VI want to thank you. Bless you. God bless you.
