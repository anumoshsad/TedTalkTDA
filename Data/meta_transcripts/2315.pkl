VThis is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder.
p4
aVIt shows the famous Fountain of Youth.
p5
aVIf you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth.
p6
aVEvery culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth.
p7
aVThere are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De León, the explorer,
p8
aVwho spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth.
p9
aVThey didn't find it.
p10
aVBut what if there was something to it?
p11
aVWhat if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?
p12
aa(lp13
VI will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research
p14
aVthat could revolutionize the way we think about aging
p15
aVand how we may treat age-related diseases in the future.
p16
aVIt started with experiments that showed,
p17
aVin a recent number of studies about growing,
p18
aVthat animals \u2014 old mice \u2014 that share a blood supply with young mice
p19
aVcan get rejuvenated.
p20
aVThis is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins,
p21
aVand I know this sounds a bit creepy.
p22
aVBut what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007,
p23
aVwas that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated
p24
aVif it's exposed to young blood through common circulation.
p25
aVThis was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later,
p26
aVand others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed
p27
aVin the pancreas, the liver and the heart.
p28
aVBut what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well,
p29
aVis that this may even apply to the brain.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment
p32
aVin this model called parabiosis,
p33
aVshows a younger brain \u2014
p34
aVand a brain that functions better.
p35
aVAnd I repeat:
p36
aVan old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation
p37
aVlooks younger and functions younger in its brain.
p38
aVSo when we get older \u2014
p39
aVwe can look at different aspects of human cognition,
p40
aVand you can see on this slide here,
p41
aVwe can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth.
p42
aVAnd up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact,
p43
aVand as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut it's scary to see how all these curves go south.
p48
aVAnd as we get older,
p49
aVdiseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop.
p50
aVWe know that with age, the connections between neurons \u2014
p51
aVthe way neurons talk to each other, the synapses \u2014 they start to deteriorate;
p52
aVneurons die, the brain starts to shrink,
p53
aVand there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.
p54
aa(lp55
VOne big problem we have \u2014 to try to understand how this really works
p56
aVat a very molecular mechanistic level \u2014
p57
aVis that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people.
p58
aVWe can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging \u2014
p59
aVall kinds of sophisticated testing.
p60
aVBut we usually have to wait until the person dies
p61
aVto get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease.
p62
aVThis is what neuropathologists do, for example.
p63
aVSo, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism.
p64
aVCould we potentially understand more
p65
aVabout what happens in the brain at the molecular level
p66
aVif we see the brain as part of the entire body?
p67
aVSo if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain?
p68
aVAnd vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body?
p69
aVAnd what connects all the different tissues in the body
p70
aVis blood.
p71
aVBlood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example,
p72
aVthe red blood cells,
p73
aVor fights infectious diseases,
p74
aVbut it also carries messenger molecules,
p75
aVhormone-like factors that transport information
p76
aVfrom one cell to another, from one tissue to another,
p77
aVincluding the brain.
p78
aVSo if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age,
p79
aVcan we learn something about the brain?
p80
aVWe know that as we get older, the blood changes as well,
p81
aVso these hormone-like factors change as we get older.
p82
aVAnd by and large, factors that we know are required
p83
aVfor the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues \u2014
p84
aVthey start to decrease as we get older,
p85
aVwhile factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation \u2014
p86
aVthey increase as we get older.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will.
p89
aVAnd to illustrate what we can do potentially with that,
p90
aVI want to talk you through an experiment that we did.
p91
aVWe had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings
p92
aV20 to 89 years of age,
p93
aVand we measured over 100 of these communication factors,
p94
aVthese hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues.
p95
aVAnd what we noticed first
p96
aVis that between the youngest and the oldest group,
p97
aVabout half the factors changed significantly.
p98
aVSo our body lives in a very different environment as we get older,
p99
aVwhen it comes to these factors.
p100
aVAnd using statistical or bioinformatics programs,
p101
aVwe could try to discover those factors that best predict age \u2014
p102
aVin a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person.
p103
aVAnd the way this looks is shown in this graph.
p104
aVSo, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived,
p105
aVthe chronological age.
p106
aVSo, how many years they lived.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd then we take these top factors that I showed you,
p109
aVand we calculate their relative age, their biological age.
p110
aVAnd what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation,
p111
aVso we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person.
p112
aVBut what's really exciting are the outliers,
p113
aVas they so often are in life.
p114
aVYou can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot
p115
aVis about 70 years of age
p116
aVbut seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true,
p117
aVof only about 45.
p118
aVSo is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age?
p119
aVBut more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk
p120
aVto develop an age-related disease and will have a long life \u2014
p121
aVwill live to 100 or more?
p122
aVOn the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot,
p123
aVis not even 40, but has a biological age of 65.
p124
aVIs this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease?
p125
aVSo in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better,
p126
aVand many other groups are trying to understand,
p127
aVwhat are the true aging factors,
p128
aVand can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right?
p131
aVYou can just say, "Well, these factors change with age,"
p132
aVbut you don't really know if they do something about aging.
p133
aVSo what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable
p134
aVand it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue.
p135
aVAnd that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, parabiosis is done in mice
p138
aVby surgically connecting the two mice together,
p139
aVand that leads then to a shared blood system,
p140
aVwhere we can now ask, "How does the old brain get influenced
p141
aVby exposure to the young blood?"
p142
aVAnd for this purpose, we use young mice
p143
aVthat are an equivalency of 20-year-old people,
p144
aVand old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhat we found is quite remarkable.
p147
aVWe find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons
p148
aVin these old brains.
p149
aVThere's an increased activity of the synapses,
p150
aVthe connections between neurons.
p151
aVThere are more genes expressed that are known to be involved
p152
aVin the formation of new memories.
p153
aVAnd there's less of this bad inflammation.
p154
aVBut we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals.
p155
aVSo when we connect them,
p156
aVthere are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model.
p157
aVInstead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors,
p158
aVso we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma,
p159
aVand inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice,
p160
aVand we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects,
p161
aVbut what we could also do now
p162
aVis we could do memory tests with mice.
p163
aa(lp164
VAs mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems.
p165
aVIt's just harder to detect them,
p166
aVbut I'll show you in a minute how we do that.
p167
aVBut we wanted to take this one step further,
p168
aVone step closer to potentially being relevant to humans.
p169
aVWhat I'm showing you now are unpublished studies,
p170
aVwhere we used human plasma, young human plasma,
p171
aVand as a control, saline,
p172
aVand injected it into old mice,
p173
aVand asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice?
p174
aVCan we make them smarter?
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd to do this, we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze.
p177
aVThis is a big table that has lots of holes in it,
p178
aVand there are guide marks around it,
p179
aVand there's a bright light, as on this stage here.
p180
aVThe mice hate this and they try to escape,
p181
aVand find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow,
p182
aVwhere a tube is mounted underneath
p183
aVwhere they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole.
p184
aVSo we teach them, over several days,
p185
aVto find this space on these cues in the space,
p186
aVand you can compare this for humans,
p187
aVto finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VMany of us have probably had some problems with that.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, let's look at an old mouse here.
p194
aVThis is an old mouse that has memory problems,
p195
aVas you'll notice in a moment.
p196
aVIt just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map
p197
aVthat would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day.
p198
aVIn stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age,
p199
aVbut it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks,
p200
aVwith small injections every three days.
p201
aVAnd as you noticed, it almost looks around, "Where am I?" \u2014
p202
aVand then walks straight to that hole and escapes.
p203
aVSo, it could remember where that hole was.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated \u2014
p206
aVit functions more like a younger mouse.
p207
aVAnd it also suggests that there is something
p208
aVnot only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma
p209
aVthat has the capacity to help this old brain.
p210
aVSo to summarize,
p211
aVwe find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable.
p212
aVThey're not set in stone; we can actually change them.
p213
aVIt can be rejuvenated.
p214
aVYoung blood factors can reverse aging,
p215
aVand what I didn't show you \u2014
p216
aVin this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old.
p217
aVSo there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging.
p218
aVAnd most importantly, humans may have similar factors,
p219
aVbecause we can take young human blood and have a similar effect.
p220
aVOld human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect;
p221
aVit does not make the mice younger.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, is this magic transferable to humans?
p224
aVWe're running a small clinical study at Stanford,
p225
aVwhere we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease
p226
aVwith a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,
p227
aVand do this once a week for four weeks,
p228
aVand then we look at their brains with imaging.
p229
aVWe test them cognitively,
p230
aVand we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living.
p231
aVWhat we hope is that there are some signs of improvement
p232
aVfrom this treatment.
p233
aVAnd if that's the case, that could give us hope
p234
aVthat what I showed you works in mice
p235
aVmight also work in humans.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, I don't think we will live forever.
p238
aVBut maybe we discovered
p239
aVthat the Fountain of Youth is actually within us,
p240
aVand it has just dried out.
p241
aVAnd if we can turn it back on a little bit,
p242
aVmaybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects,
p243
aVwe can produce these factors synthetically
p244
aVand we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease
p245
aVor other dementias.
p246

VThank you very much.
