VWe see with the eyes,
p4
aVbut we see with the brain as well.
p5
aVAnd seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
p6
aVAnd we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination,
p7
aVour inscapes.  We've lived with them all our lives.
p8
aVBut there are also hallucinations as well,
p9
aVand hallucinations  are completely different.
p10
aVThey don't seem to be of our creation.
p11
aVThey don't seem to be under our control.
p12
aVThey seem to come from the outside,
p13
aVand to mimic perception.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I am going to be talking about hallucinations,
p16
aVand a particular sort of visual hallucination
p17
aVwhich I see among my patients.
p18
aVA few months ago, I got a phone call
p19
aVfrom a nursing home where I work.
p20
aVThey told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,
p21
aVwas seeing things,
p22
aVand they wondered if she'd gone bonkers
p23
aVor, because she was an old lady,
p24
aVwhether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie,
p27
aVthe old lady.
p28
aVI went in to see her.
p29
aVIt was evident straight away
p30
aVthat she was perfectly sane
p31
aVand lucid and  of good intelligence,
p32
aVbut she'd been very startled and very bewildered,
p33
aVbecause she'd been seeing things.
p34
aVAnd she told me \u2014
p35
aVthe nurses hadn't mentioned this \u2014
p36
aVthat she was blind,
p37
aVthat she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
p38
aVBut now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I said, "What sort of things?"
p41
aVAnd she said, "People in Eastern dress,
p42
aVin drapes, walking up and down stairs.
p43
aVA man who turns towards me and smiles.
p44
aVBut he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
p45
aVAnimals too.
p46
aVI see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.
p47
aVI see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.
p48
aVThen, one night, the scene changes.
p49
aVI see cats and dogs walking towards me.
p50
aVThey come to a certain point and then stop.
p51
aVThen it changes again.
p52
aVI see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.
p53
aVThey wear bright colors, rose and blue,
p54
aVlike Eastern dress."
p55
aa(lp56
VSometimes, she said, before the people come on,
p57
aVshe may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,
p58
aVwhich seem to go up to the ceiling.
p59
aVI said, "Is this like a dream?"
p60
aVAnd she said, "No, it's not like a dream. It's like a movie."
p61
aVShe said, "It's got color. It's got motion.
p62
aVBut it's completely silent, like a silent movie."
p63
aVAnd she said that it's a rather boring movie.
p64
aVShe said, "All these people with Eastern dress,
p65
aVwalking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd she has a sense of humor.
p69
aVShe knew it was a hallucination.
p70
aVBut she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years
p71
aVand she'd never had a hallucination before.
p72
aVShe said that the hallucinations were unrelated
p73
aVto anything she was thinking or feeling or doing,
p74
aVthat they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.
p75
aVShe had no control over them.
p76
aVShe said she didn't recognize
p77
aVany of the people or places
p78
aVin the hallucinations.
p79
aVAnd none of the people or the animals,
p80
aVwell, they all seemed oblivious of her.
p81
aVAnd she didn't know what was going on.
p82
aVShe wondered if she was going mad
p83
aVor losing her mind.
p84
aa(lp85
VWell, I examined her carefully.
p86
aVShe was a bright old lady,
p87
aVperfectly sane. She had no medical problems.
p88
aVShe wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
p89
aVBut she was blind.
p90
aVAnd I then said to her,
p91
aV"I think I know what you have."
p92
aVI said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination
p93
aVwhich may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.
p94
aVThis was originally described," I said,
p95
aV"right back in the 18th century,
p96
aVby a man called Charles Bonnet.
p97
aVAnd you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
p98
aVThere is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.
p99
aVYou have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd she was very relieved at this,
p102
aVthat there was nothing seriously the matter,
p103
aVand also rather curious.
p104
aVShe said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
p105
aVShe said, "Did he have them himself?"
p106
aVAnd she said, "Tell all the nurses
p107
aVthat I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aV"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
p110
aVWell, so I did tell the nurses.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow this, for me, is a common situation.
p113
aVI work in old-age homes, largely.
p114
aVI see a lot of elderly people
p115
aVwho are hearing impaired or visually impaired.
p116
aVAbout 10 percent of the hearing impaired people
p117
aVget musical hallucinations.
p118
aVAnd about 10 percent of the visually impaired people
p119
aVget visual hallucinations.
p120
aVYou don't have to be completely blind,
p121
aVonly sufficiently impaired.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow with the original description in the 18th century,
p124
aVCharles Bonnet did not have them.
p125
aVHis grandfather had these hallucinations.
p126
aVHis grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.
p127
aVHe'd had cataract surgery.
p128
aVHis vision was pretty poor.
p129
aVAnd in 1759, he described to his grandson
p130
aVvarious things he was seeing.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe first thing he said was he saw
p133
aVa handkerchief in midair.
p134
aVIt was a large blue handkerchief
p135
aVwith four orange circles.
p136
aVAnd he knew it was a hallucination.
p137
aVYou don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
p138
aVAnd then he saw a big wheel in midair.
p139
aVBut sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not,
p140
aVbecause the hallucinations would fit
p141
aVin the context of the visions.
p142
aVSo on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them,
p143
aVhe said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"
p144
aVAnd they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."
p145
aVAnd then the handsome young men disappeared.
p146
aVIt's typical of these hallucinations
p147
aVthat they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
p148
aVThey don't usually fade in and out.
p149
aVThey are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
p150
aa(lp151
VCharles Lullin, the grandfather,
p152
aVsaw hundreds of different figures,
p153
aVdifferent landscapes of all sorts.
p154
aVOn one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,
p155
aVand realized it was himself.
p156
aVThat was the only figure he recognized.
p157
aVOn one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris,
p158
aVhe saw \u2014 this was real \u2014 a scaffolding.
p159
aVBut when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding
p160
aVsix inches high, on his study table.
p161
aVThis repetition of perception
p162
aVis sometimes called palinopsia.
p163
aa(lp164
VWith him and with Rosalie,
p165
aVwhat seems to be going on \u2014
p166
aVand Rosalie said, "What's going on?" \u2014
p167
aVand I said that as you lose vision,
p168
aVas the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,
p169
aVthey become hyperactive and excitable,
p170
aVand they start to fire spontaneously.
p171
aVAnd you start to see things.
p172
aVThe things you see can be very complicated indeed.
p173
aa(lp174
VWith another patient of mine,
p175
aVwho, also had some vision,
p176
aVthe vision she had could be disturbing.
p177
aVOn one occasion, she said she saw
p178
aVa man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.
p179
aVAnd he turned around. And then
p180
aVhe divided into six figures in striped shirts,
p181
aVwho started walking towards her.
p182
aVAnd then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.
p183
aVOnce, when she was driving,
p184
aVor rather, her husband was driving,
p185
aVthe road divided into four
p186
aVand she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
p187
aa(lp188
VShe had very mobile hallucinations as well.
p189
aVA lot of them had to do with a car.
p190
aVSometimes she would see a teenage boy
p191
aVsitting on the hood of the car.
p192
aVHe was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully
p193
aVwhen the car turned.
p194
aVAnd then when they came to a stop,
p195
aVthe boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air,
p196
aVand then disappear.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnother patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.
p199
aVThis was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes,
p200
aVbut the visual parts of her brain,
p201
aVa little tumor in the occipital cortex.
p202
aVAnd, above all, she would see cartoons.
p203
aVThese cartoons would be transparent
p204
aVand would cover half the visual field, like a screen.
p205
aVAnd especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVNow, I don't watch Sesame Street,
p208
aVbut she made a point of saying,
p209
aV"Why Kermit?" she said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.
p210
aVYou know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.
p211
aVWhy Kermit?
p212
aVKermit the Frog means nothing to me."
p213
aa(lp214
VShe didn't mind the cartoons too much.
p215
aVBut what did disturb her was she got very persistent
p216
aVimages or hallucinations of faces
p217
aVand as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,
p218
aVwith very large teeth or very large eyes.
p219
aVAnd these frightened her.
p220
aVWell, what is going on with these people?
p221
aVAs a physician, I have to try and define what's going on,
p222
aVand to reassure people,
p223
aVespecially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
p224
aa(lp225
VSomething like 10 percent, as I said,
p226
aVof visually impaired people get these.
p227
aVBut no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,
p228
aVbecause they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.
p229
aVAnd if they do mention them to their own doctors
p230
aVthey may be misdiagnosed.
p231
aa(lp232
VIn particular, the notion is that if you see
p233
aVthings or hear things, you're going mad,
p234
aVbut the psychotic hallucinations  are quite different.
p235
aVPsychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,
p236
aVthey address you. They accuse you.
p237
aVThey seduce you. They humiliate you.
p238
aVThey jeer at you.
p239
aVYou interact with them.
p240
aVThere is none of this quality of being addressed
p241
aVwith these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
p242
aVThere is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you,
p243
aVor that's how people think about it.
p244
aa(lp245
VThere is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy,
p246
aVand sometimes, if one has this,
p247
aVone may feel oneself transported back
p248
aVto a time and place in the past.
p249
aVYou're at a particular road junction.
p250
aVYou smell chestnuts roasting.
p251
aVYou hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.
p252
aVAnd you're waiting for your girl.
p253
aVAnd it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.
p254
aVAnd the temporal lobe hallucinations
p255
aVare all-sense hallucinations,
p256
aVfull of feeling, full of familiarity,
p257
aVlocated in space and time,
p258
aVcoherent, dramatic.
p259
aVThe Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,
p262
aVyou have all sorts of levels,
p263
aVfrom the geometrical hallucinations \u2014
p264
aVthe pink and blue squares the woman had \u2014
p265
aVup to quite elaborate hallucinations
p266
aVwith figures and especially faces.
p267
aVFaces, and sometimes deformed faces,
p268
aVare the single commonest thing
p269
aVin these hallucinations.
p270
aVAnd one of the second commonest is cartoons.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, what is going on?
p273
aVFascinatingly, in the last few years,
p274
aVit's been possible to do functional brain imagery,
p275
aVto do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.
p276
aVAnd in fact, to find that different parts
p277
aVof the visual brain are activated
p278
aVas they are hallucinating.
p279
aVWhen people have these simple geometrical hallucinations,
p280
aVthe primary visual cortex is activated.
p281
aVThis is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.
p282
aVYou don't form images with your primary visual cortex.
p283
aa(lp284
VWhen images are formed,
p285
aVa higher part of the visual cortex
p286
aVis involved in the temporal lobe.
p287
aVAnd in particular, one area of the temporal lobe
p288
aVis called the fusiform gyrus.
p289
aVAnd it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus,
p290
aVthey maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.
p291
aVBut if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus,
p292
aVthey may hallucinate faces,
p293
aVand this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
p294
aVThere is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus
p295
aVwhere teeth and eyes are represented,
p296
aVand that part of the gyrus is activated
p297
aVwhen people get the deformed hallucinations.
p298
aa(lp299
VThere is another part of the brain
p300
aVwhich is especially activated
p301
aVwhen one sees cartoons.
p302
aVIt's activated when one recognizes cartoons,
p303
aVwhen one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
p304
aVIt's very interesting that that should be specific.
p305
aVThere are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved
p306
aVwith the recognition and hallucination
p307
aVof buildings and landscapes.
p308
aa(lp309
VAround 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,
p310
aVbut particular cells.
p311
aV"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.
p312
aVAnd now we know that there are hundreds of other
p313
aVsorts of cells,
p314
aVwhich can be very, very specific.
p315
aVSo you may not only have
p316
aV"car" cells,
p317
aVyou may have "Aston Martin" cells.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVI saw an Aston Martin this morning.
p320
aVI had to bring it in.
p321
aVAnd now it's in there somewhere.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VNow, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex,
p325
aVthere are only visual images,
p326
aVor figments or fragments.
p327
aVIt's only at higher levels
p328
aVthat the other senses join in
p329
aVand there are connections with memory and emotion.
p330
aVAnd in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,
p331
aVyou don't go to those higher levels.
p332
aVYou're in these levels of inferior visual cortex
p333
aVwhere you have thousands and tens of thousands
p334
aVand millions of images,
p335
aVor figments, or fragmentary figments,
p336
aVall neurally encoded
p337
aVin particular cells or small clusters of cells.
p338
aa(lp339
VNormally these are all part of
p340
aVthe integrated stream of perception, or imagination,
p341
aVand one is not conscious of them.
p342
aVIt is only if one is visually impaired or blind
p343
aVthat the process is interrupted.
p344
aVAnd instead of getting normal perception,
p345
aVyou're getting an anarchic,
p346
aVconvulsive stimulation, or release,
p347
aVof all of these visual cells
p348
aVin the inferotemporal cortex.
p349
aVSo, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.
p350
aVSuddenly this, and suddenly that.
p351
aVThe mind does its best to organize
p352
aVand to give some sort of coherence to this,
p353
aVbut not terribly successfully.
p354
aa(lp355
VWhen these were first described,
p356
aVit was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.
p357
aVBut in fact people say,
p358
aV"I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations."
p359
aV"Kermit means nothing to me."
p360
aVYou don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.
p361
aa(lp362
VWell, I've more or less said what I wanted.
p363
aVI think I just want to recapitulate
p364
aVand say this is common.
p365
aVThink of the number of blind people.
p366
aVThere must be hundreds of thousands of blind people
p367
aVwho have these hallucinations,
p368
aVbut are too scared to mention them.
p369
aVSo this sort of thing needs to be brought into
p370
aVnotice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.
p371
aVFinally, I think they are
p372
aVinfinitely interesting and valuable,
p373
aVfor giving one some insight as to how the brain works.
p374
aa(lp375
VCharles Bonnet said, 250 years ago \u2014
p376
aVhe wondered how, thinking these hallucinations,
p377
aVhow, as he put it, the theater of the mind
p378
aVcould be generated by the machinery of the brain.
p379
aVNow, 250 years later,
p380
aVI think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.
p381
aVThanks very much.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VChris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.
p386
aVYou speak about these things with so much insight
p387
aVand empathy for your patients.
p388
aVHave you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?
p389
aa(lp390
VOliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
p391
aV(Laughter)
p392
aVWell, yeah, a lot of them.
p393
aVAnd actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.
p394
aVI'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.
p395
aVAnd I see the geometrical hallucinations.
p396
aVBut they stop there.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: And they don't disturb you?
p399
aVBecause you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?
p400
aa(lp401
VOS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus,
p402
aVwhich I ignore.
p403
aVThey occasionally interest me,
p404
aVand I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.
p405
aVI've gone and had an fMRI myself,
p406
aVto see how my visual cortex is taking over.
p407
aVAnd when I see all these hexagons
p408
aVand complex things, which I also have,
p409
aVin visual migraine,
p410
aVI wonder whether everyone sees things like this,
p411
aVand whether things like cave art or ornamental art
p412
aVmay have been derived from them a bit.
p413
aa(lp414
VCA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.
p415
aVThank you so much for sharing.
