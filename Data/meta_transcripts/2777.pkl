VI'm going to tell you the story of a song.
p4
aVI was in Madrid one night in 2002
p5
aVwith my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,
p6
aVwhen he said he had something to give me.
p7
aVHe said,
p8
aV"Jorge, I have some lines that you need to put into a song.
p9
aVTake these down, take these down."
p10
aVI looked on the table but all I found was a circular coaster,
p11
aVon which I wrote the lines my teacher dictated.
p12
aVThey were four lines that went like this:
p13
aa(lp14
V"I am a Jewish Moor living among Christians
p15
aVI don't know who my God is, nor who my brothers are."
p16
aa(lp17
VThose lines really made an impression on me.
p18
aVI said, "What beautiful lyrics, Joaquín. Did you write them?"
p19
aVHe said no, they were by another composer named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,
p20
aVwho was less known than Joaquín, but also a great poet.
p21
aVThese lines came to me at a time
p22
aVwhere I had been wanting to express something for a while,
p23
aVbut didn't quite know how.
p24
aa(lp25
VI was getting up to leave and go home to write,
p26
aVwhen Joaquín stopped me and said, "Hang on, hang on,"
p27
aVand presented me with this challenge:
p28
aV"Write the stanzas for this song
p29
aVin Décimas."
p30
aVNow, at this point in my life,
p31
aVI still wasn't completely sure what Décimas were,
p32
aVbut I was too embarrassed to tell my teacher I didn't know.
p33
aVSo I put on my best "Yeah, I totally understand" face,
p34
aVand went home to look up what Décimas were.
p35
aVI learned that a Décima is a type of verse
p36
aVthat only exists in Spanish,
p37
aVand that it has 10 lines.
p38
aVIt's very, very complex \u2014
p39
aVperhaps the most complex style of stanza that we have in Spanish.
p40
aVIt also has a very concrete date of origin,
p41
aVwhich is very rare for a style of stanza.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,
p44
aVby a guy named Vicente Espinel, a musician and poet from Málaga.
p45
aVAnd listen to this coincidence: he was the same guy
p46
aVwho added the sixth string
p47
aVto what would later be called the Spanish guitar.
p48
aVThis string right here \u2014
p49
aVit's called the "bordona."
p50
aa(lp51
VFrom Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,
p52
aVcrosses over to America, just like the Spanish guitar,
p53
aVbut in contrast to the Décima,
p54
aVthe Spanish guitar continues to live today
p55
aVon both sides of the Atlantic.
p56
aVBut the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,
p57
aVdisappeared; it died out.
p58
aVIt died out about 200 years ago,
p59
aVand yet in Latin America, from Mexico to Chile,
p60
aVall our countries maintain some form of the Décima
p61
aVin our popular traditions.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn each place, they've given it a different name,
p64
aVand set it to different music.
p65
aVIt has a lot of different names \u2014 more than 20 in total on the continent.
p66
aVIn Mexico, for example, it's called the "Son Jarocho,"
p67
aV"Canto de mejorana" in Panama;
p68
aV"Galerón" in Venezuela;
p69
aV"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;
p70
aV"Repentismo" in Cuba.
p71
aVIn Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,
p72
aVbecause the Décima becomes so integrated into our traditions,
p73
aVthat if someone asks, people from each place are completely convinced
p74
aVthat the Décima was invented in their country.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VIt's also got a really surprising feature,
p79
aVwhich is that despite the fact that it developed independently
p80
aVin each of the different countries,
p81
aVit maintains even today, 400 years after its creation,
p82
aVexactly the same rhyme, syllable and line structure \u2014
p83
aVthe same structure Vicente Espinel gave it during the Spanish Baroque period.
p84
aVHere's the structure \u2014
p85
aVI'll give you the basic idea and then later you can look online
p86
aVand learn more about it.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe Décima is ten lines long; each line has eight syllables.
p89
aVThe first line rhymes with the fourth and the fifth;
p90
aVthe second line, with the third;
p91
aVthe sixth line, with the seventh and the tenth;
p92
aVand the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.
p93
aVIt's a bit complicated, to be honest.
p94
aVAnd me \u2014 imagine me, trying to write in Décimas.
p95
aVBut it's not as complicated as it seems.
p96
aVPlus, it's amazing that it's survived with the same structure
p97
aVfor more than four centuries.
p98
aVIt's not that complicated, because it has an impressive musicality to it,
p99
aVa type of musicality
p100
aVthat's very hard to describe technically.
p101
aVI prefer that you listen to it.
p102
aVSo I'm going to recite a Décima,
p103
aVone of the Décimas that I wrote for this song.
p104
aVI'm going to ask that you concentrate just on the musicality of the rhymes.
p105
aVFor those of you with headphones on \u2014
p106
aVI see that some of you are listening to the translation \u2014
p107
aVplease take them off for a minute.
p108
aa(lp109
V(English) Take your headphones off, it you have them.
p110
aa(lp111
V(English) Forget about the meaning of the words for a few seconds,
p112
aa(lp113
V(English) and then you'll put them back.
p114
aa(lp115
V(English) Forget about the structure.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Spanish) Forget about the structure.
p118
aa(lp119
V(English) And just ... it's all about the choreography of sound of the Décima.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Spanish) A choreography of sound.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Sings in Spanish) "There is not one death that does not cause me pain,
p124
aVthere are no winners,
p125
aVhere\u2019s nothing but suffering and another life blown away.
p126
aVWar is a terrible school no matter what the disguise,
p127
aVforgive me for not enlisting under any flag,
p128
aVany daydream is worth more than a sad piece of cloth."
p129
aa(lp130
VThat's a Décima.
p131
aa(lp132
V(English) You can put your headphones back on.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
V(English) Thank you.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VI also applaud Vicente Espinel, because here it is 426 years later,
p141
aVand the Décima lives on everywhere
p142
aVin its original state.
p143
aa(lp144
VI wrote three like that one; you just heard the second.
p145
aVI wrote the first one having only recently learned how,
p146
aVand it has some errors in terms of meter,
p147
aVso it's not presentable in its current state.
p148
aVBut the one I sang was good, more or less.
p149
aVSo: What was it about?
p150
aVWhat was the meaning behind those lines?
p151
aa(lp152
VI had just returned from doing a concert in Israel,
p153
aVand I was very emotional over a problem that hits really close to home,
p154
aVwhich is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
p155
aVI'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,
p156
aVand my mom's family are non-practicing Christians.
p157
aVI was raised in a home where the two traditions lived together
p158
aVmore or less in harmony.
p159
aVIt wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa dressed as Santa Claus, for example,
p160
aVor to see my non-Jewish grandpa at the synagogue wearing his kippah,
p161
aVat family celebrations, wearing the same expression that I probably had
p162
aVwhen Sabina told me \u2014
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
Vthat he had some Décima lines for me.
p167
aVFor someone raised in that kind of environment,
p168
aVit's especially painful to see the difficulty the opposing parties have
p169
aVin putting themselves in the other side's shoes even for a moment.
p170
aVSo that's what I wrote about.
p171
aa(lp172
VI already had the lyrics,
p173
aVI had the form \u2014 the Décima \u2014 and the content.
p174
aVI needed to write the music.
p175
aVI'll give you some context.
p176
aVI had only recently moved from Uruguay, where I'm from, to Spain.
p177
aVAnd I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,
p178
aVlike many of you here, who are away from home.
p179
aVAnd I wanted my song to be very, very Uruguayan,
p180
aVthe most Uruguayan type of song there is \u2014 the milonga.
p181
aVSo now, I had been studying the Décima, and after finding out
p182
aVthat everyone tried to claim the Décima as their own,
p183
aVthat it was invented in their country,
p184
aVit made me wonder:
p185
aVWhat does it mean when we say the milonga is Uruguayan?
p186
aa(lp187
VThe milonga has a rhythmic pattern that we musicians call 3-3-2.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd it has a characteristic emphasis.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Sings)
p194
aa(lp195
VBut this characteristic rhythm pattern
p196
aVcomes from Africa.
p197
aVIn the ninth century you could find it in the brothels of Persia,
p198
aVand in the thirteenth,
p199
aVin Spain, from where, five centuries later,
p200
aVit would cross over to America with the African slaves.
p201
aVMeanwhile, in the Balkans, it encounters the Roma scale \u2014
p202
aa(lp203
V(Sings)
p204
aa(lp205
Vwhich in part, gives birth to klezmer music,
p206
aVwhich Ukrainian Jewish immigrants bring to Brooklyn, New York.
p207
aVThey sing it in their banquet halls.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Sings "Hava Nagila")
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd their neighbor, an Argentine kid of Italian origin
p212
aVnamed Astor Piazzolla,
p213
aVhears it,
p214
aVassimilates it
p215
aVand transforms the tango of the second half of the 20th century
p216
aVwith his ...
p217
aa(lp218
V(Counts out the beats) One two three, one two three, one two.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Sings "Adios Nonino")
p221
aa(lp222
VHe also played it on his bandoneon, a 19th-century German instrument
p223
aVcreated for churches that couldn't afford to buy organs,
p224
aVand that ends up, incredibly, in Río de la Plata,
p225
aVforming the very essence of the tango and the milonga,
p226
aVin the very same way another instrument just as important as the bandoneon did:
p227
aVthe Spanish guitar.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VTo which, by the way, Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,
p232
aVadded a sixth string.
p233
aVIt's amazing how all these things are coming full circle.
p234
aa(lp235
VWhat have I learned in these 15 years since the song was born
p236
aVfrom going all over the world with four lines written on a coaster
p237
aVfrom a bar in Madrid?
p238
aVThat Décimas,
p239
aVthe milonga,
p240
aVsongs, people \u2014
p241
aVthe closer you get to them,
p242
aVthe more complex their identity becomes,
p243
aVand the more nuances and details appear.
p244
aVI learned that identity is infinitely dense,
p245
aVlike an infinite series of real numbers,
p246
aVand that even if you get very close
p247
aVand zoom in,
p248
aVit never ends.
p249
aa(lp250
VBefore I sing you a song and say goodbye,
p251
aVallow me to tell you one last story.
p252
aVNot long ago, we were in Mexico after a concert.
p253
aVAnd since the concert promoters know me,
p254
aVthey knew I was a Décima freak and that everywhere I go I ask about it,
p255
aVinsisting on hearing Décima artists.
p256
aVSo they organized a son jarocho show for me at their house.
p257
aVIf you recall, the son jarocho is one of the styles of music
p258
aVthat uses Décimas in its verses.
p259
aa(lp260
VWhen these amazing musicians finished playing
p261
aVwhat is for me, something amazing, which is the son jarocho,
p262
aVthey finished playing and were ...
p263
aVI went up to greet them, really excited,
p264
aVgetting ready to thank them for their gift of music,
p265
aVand this young kid says to me \u2014
p266
aVand he says it with the best of intentions \u2014 he says,
p267
aV"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping alive the purest origins
p268
aVof our Mexican identity."
p269
aVAnd to tell you the truth, I didn't really know what to say.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VI stood there looking at him. I gave him a hug and left, but ...
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VBut he was right, too, though. Right?
p278
aVIn reality, the Décima is its origin, but at the same time,
p279
aVjust like in the milonga and in the Décima,
p280
aVare the roots of many more cultures from all over the place, like he said.
p281
aa(lp282
VLater, when I got back to the hotel, I thought about it for a while.
p283
aVAnd I thought:
p284
aVthings only look pure
p285
aVif you look at them from far away.
p286
aVIt's very important to know about our roots,
p287
aVto know where we come from, to understand our history.
p288
aVBut at the same time, as important as knowing where we're from,
p289
aVis understanding that deep down,
p290
aVwe're all from nowhere
p291
aVand a little bit from everywhere.
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you very much.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Applause)
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is "The milonga of the Jewish Moor."

p306
aa(lp307

p308
aa(lp309
Vand every beloved stone has my deepest affection,
p310
aa(lp311
Vthere is not a stone in the world worth more than a human life.
