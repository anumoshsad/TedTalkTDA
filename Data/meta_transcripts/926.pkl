VFor a moment, what I need to do
p4
aVis project something on the screen of your imagination.
p5
aVWe're in 17th century Japan
p6
aVon the west coast,
p7
aVand a little, wizened monk
p8
aVis hurrying along, near midnight,
p9
aVto the crest of a small hill.
p10
aVHe arrives on the small hill,
p11
aVdripping with water.
p12
aVHe stands there,
p13
aVand he looks across at the island, Sado.
p14
aVAnd he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.
p15
aVThen he says to himself, very quietly,
p16
aV"[Turbulent the sea,]
p17
aV[Stretching across to Sado]
p18
aV[The Milky Way]."
p19
aVBasho was a brilliant man.
p20
aVHe said more with less
p21
aVthan any human
p22
aVthat I have ever read or talked to.
p23
aVBasho, in 17 syllables,
p24
aVjuxtaposed
p25
aVa turbulent ocean
p26
aVdriven by a storm now past,
p27
aVand captured the almost
p28
aVimpossible beauty
p29
aVof our home galaxy
p30
aVwith millions of stars,
p31
aVprobably hundreds and hundreds of \u2014 who knows how many \u2014 planets,
p32
aVmaybe even an ocean
p33
aVthat we will probably call Sylvia in time.
p34
aVAs he was nearing his death,
p35
aVhis disciples and followers
p36
aVkept asking him,
p37
aV"What's the secret?
p38
aVHow can you
p39
aVmake haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"
p40
aVAnd toward the end, he said,
p41
aV"If you would know the pine tree,
p42
aVgo to the pine tree."
p43
aVThat was it.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VSylvia has said we must use
p48
aVevery capacity we have
p49
aVin order to know the oceans.
p50
aVIf we would know the oceans,
p51
aVwe must go to the oceans.
p52
aVAnd what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,
p53
aVis really transforming
p54
aVthe relationship, or the interplay,
p55
aVbetween humans and oceans
p56
aVwith a new capability
p57
aVthat is not at all routine yet.
p58
aVI hope it will be.
p59
aVThere are a few key points.
p60
aVOne of them is the oceans are central
p61
aVto the quality of life on earth.
p62
aVAnother is that there are bold, new ways
p63
aVof studying oceans
p64
aVthat we have not used well yet.
p65
aVAnd the last is that these bold, new ways
p66
aVthat we are exploring
p67
aVas a community
p68
aVwill transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,
p69
aVand eventually how we manage
p70
aVprobably the entire planet, for what it's worth.
p71
aVSo what scientists do when they begin
p72
aVis to start with the system.
p73
aVThey define what the system is.
p74
aVThe system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
p75
aVIt's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
p76
aVIt's the whole planet,
p77
aVthe entire planet, continents and oceans together.
p78
aVThat's the system.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd basically, our challenge
p81
aVis to optimize the benefits
p82
aVand mitigate the risks
p83
aVof living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,
p84
aVtwo sources of energy,
p85
aVone of which is solar,
p86
aVthat drives the winds, the waves,
p87
aVthe clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.
p88
aVThe second one is internal energy.
p89
aVAnd these two war against one another
p90
aValmost continuously.
p91
aVMountain ranges, plate tectonics,
p92
aVmoves the continents around, forms ore deposits.
p93
aVVolcanoes erupt.
p94
aVThat's the planet that we live on.
p95
aVIt's immensely complex.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,
p98
aVbut what I want you to see is
p99
aVthis is about 10 percent
p100
aVof the processes that operate within
p101
aVthe oceans almost continuously,
p102
aVand have for the last 4 billion years.
p103
aVThis is a system that's been around a very long time.
p104
aVAnd these have all co-evolved.
p105
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p106
aVThey interact with one another constantly.
p107
aVAll of them interact with one another.
p108
aVSo the complexity of this system that we're looking at,
p109
aVthe one driven by the sun \u2014
p110
aVupper portion, mostly \u2014
p111
aVand the lower portion is partly driven
p112
aVby the input from heat below
p113
aVand by other processes.
p114
aVThis is very, very important
p115
aVbecause this is the system, this is the crucible,
p116
aVout of which life on the planet came,
p117
aVand it's now time for us to understand it.
p118
aVWe must understand it.
p119
aVThat's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:
p120
aVunderstand this ocean of ours,
p121
aVthis basic life support system,
p122
aVthe dominant life support system on the planet.
p123
aa(lp124
VLook at this complexity here.
p125
aVThis is only one variable.
p126
aVIf you can see the complexity,
p127
aVyou can see how
p128
aVtiny, little eddies
p129
aVand large eddies and the motion \u2014
p130
aVthis is just sea surface temperature,
p131
aVbut it's immensely complicated.
p132
aVNow a layer in,
p133
aVthe other two or three hundred processes
p134
aVthat are all interacting,
p135
aVpartly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,
p136
aVand you've got a really complicated system.
p137
aVThat's our challenge, is to understand,
p138
aVunderstand this system in new and phenomenal ways.
p139
aVAnd there's an urgency to this.
p140
aVPart of the urgency comes from the fact
p141
aVthat, of order, a billion people on the planet currently
p142
aVare undernourished or starving.
p143
aVAnd part of the issue
p144
aVis for Cody \u2014
p145
aVwho's here,
p146
aV16 years old \u2014
p147
aVand I have permission to relay this number.
p148
aVWhen he, 40 years from now,
p149
aVis the age of Nancy Brown,
p150
aVthere are going to be
p151
aVanother two and a half billion people on the planet.
p152
aVWe can't solve all the problems
p153
aVby looking only at the oceans,
p154
aVbut if we don't understand
p155
aVthe fundamental life support system of this planet
p156
aVmuch more thoroughly than we do now,
p157
aVthen the stresses that we will face,
p158
aVand that Cody will face,
p159
aVand even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,
p160
aVwill have really problems coping.
p161
aa(lp162
VAll right, let's talk about another perspective
p163
aVon the importance of the oceans.
p164
aVLook at this diagram, which is showing
p165
aVwarm waters in red,
p166
aVcool waters in blue,
p167
aVand on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,
p168
aVis the growth of vegetation,
p169
aVand in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.
p170
aVAnd in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away
p171
aVfrom 1982 to 1998
p172
aVand then cycling again.
p173
aVWhat you'll see is that the rhythms
p174
aVof growth, of vegetation \u2014
p175
aVa subset of which is food on the continents \u2014
p176
aVis directly tied to the rhythms
p177
aVof the sea surface temperatures.
p178
aVThe oceans control,
p179
aVor at least significantly influence,
p180
aVcorrelate with,
p181
aVthe growth patterns and the drought patterns
p182
aVand the rain patterns on the continents.
p183
aVSo people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,
p184
aVneed to understand that the oceans
p185
aVare central to them as well.
p186
aVAnother complexity: this is the age of the oceans.
p187
aVI'm going to layer in on top of this
p188
aVthe tectonic plates.
p189
aVThe age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,
p190
aVgives rise to a totally new phenomenon
p191
aVthat we have heard about
p192
aVin this conference.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd I share with you some very high-definition video
p195
aVthat we collected in real time.
p196
aVSeconds after this video was taken,
p197
aVpeople in Beijing,
p198
aVpeople in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,
p199
aVpeople in Washington D.C. were watching this.
p200
aVNow you've heard of hydrothermal vents,
p201
aVbut the other discovery
p202
aVis that deep below the sea floor,
p203
aVthere is vast reservoir of microbial activity,
p204
aVwhich we have only just discovered
p205
aVand we have almost no way to study.
p206
aVSome people have estimated
p207
aVthat the biomass
p208
aVtied up in these microbes
p209
aVliving in the pours and the cracks
p210
aVof the sea floor and below
p211
aVrival the total amount of living biomass
p212
aVat the surface of the planet.
p213
aVIt's an astonishing insight,
p214
aVand we have only found out about this recently.
p215
aVThis is very, very exciting.
p216
aVIt may be the next rainforest,
p217
aVin terms of pharmaceuticals.
p218
aVWe know little or nothing about it.
p219
aa(lp220
VWell, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying
p221
aVthat, "The real voyage of discovery
p222
aVconsists not so much in seeking new territory,
p223
aVbut possibly in having new sets of eyes,"
p224
aVnew ways of seeing things,
p225
aVa new mindset.
p226
aVAnd many of you remember
p227
aVthe early stages of oceanography,
p228
aVwhen we had to use what we had at our fingertips.
p229
aVAnd it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.
p230
aVSome of you remember this, I'm sure.
p231
aVAnd now, we have an entire suite of tools
p232
aVthat are really pretty powerful \u2014
p233
aVships, satellites, moorings.
p234
aVBut they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd the program that I wanted to talk to you about
p237
aVjust a little bit here,
p238
aVwas funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles
p239
aVlike the one running across the base of this image.
p240
aVModeling: on the right hand side,
p241
aVthere's a very complex computational model.
p242
aVOn the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,
p243
aVwhich I'll show you in just a second.
p244
aVAnd on the basis
p245
aVof several points,
p246
aVthe oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.
p247
aVThey are changing rapidly, but not predictably.
p248
aVAnd the models that we need to predict the future
p249
aVdo not have enough data to refine them.
p250
aVThe computational power
p251
aVis amazing.
p252
aVBut without data, those models
p253
aVwill never ever be predicted.
p254
aVAnd that's what we really need.
p255
aVFor a variety of reasons they're dangerous,
p256
aVbut we feel that OOI,
p257
aVthis Ocean Observatory Initiative,
p258
aVwhich the National Science Foundation
p259
aVhas begun to fund,
p260
aVhas the potential to really transform things.
p261
aVAnd the goal of the program is to
p262
aVlaunch an era of scientific discovery
p263
aVand understanding
p264
aVacross and within the ocean basins,
p265
aVutilizing widely accessible,
p266
aVinteractive telepresence.
p267
aVIt's a new world.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe will be present throughout
p270
aVthe volume of the ocean, at will,
p271
aVcommunicating in real time.
p272
aVAnd this is what the system involves,
p273
aVa number of sites in the southern hemisphere,
p274
aVshown in those circles.
p275
aVAnd in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.
p276
aVI won't talk a lot about most of them right here,
p277
aVbut the one on the west coast, that's in the box,
p278
aVis called the regional scale nodes.
p279
aVIt was once called Neptune.
p280
aVAnd let me show you what's behind it.
p281
aa(lp282
VFiber: next-generation way of communicating.
p283
aVYou can see the copper tips on these things.
p284
aVYou can transmit power,
p285
aVbut the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads
p286
aVsmaller than the hair on your head in diameter.
p287
aVAnd this particular set here
p288
aVcan transmit something of the order of
p289
aVthree to five terabits per second.
p290
aVThis is phenomenal bandwidth.
p291
aVAnd this is what the planet looks like.
p292
aVWe are already laced up
p293
aVas if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.
p294
aVThis is what it looks like.
p295
aVAnd the cables go really continent to continent.
p296
aVIt's a very powerful system,
p297
aVand most of our communications consist of it.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo this is the system that I'm talking about,
p300
aVoff the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,
p301
aVthe Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.
p302
aVAnd it's going to deliver abundant power
p303
aVand unprecedented bandwidth
p304
aVacross this entire volume \u2014
p305
aVin the overlying ocean,
p306
aVon the sea floor and below the sea floor.
p307
aVBandwidth and power
p308
aVand a wide variety of processes
p309
aVthat will be operating.
p310
aVThis is what one of those primary nodes looks like,
p311
aVand it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth
p312
aVthat can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.
p313
aVAnd the kind of science that can be done
p314
aVwill be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved
p315
aVand can bring the instrumentation to the table.
p316
aVThey will bring it and link it in.
p317
aVIt'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,
p318
aVexcept you'll have your own port.
p319
aVClimate change, ocean acidification,
p320
aVdissolved oxygen,
p321
aVcarbon cycle, coastal upwelling,
p322
aVfishing dynamics \u2014
p323
aVthe full spectrum of
p324
aVearth science and ocean science
p325
aVsimultaneously in the same volume.
p326
aVSo anyone coming along later
p327
aVsimply accesses the database
p328
aVand can draw down the information they need
p329
aVabout anything that has taken place.
p330
aVAnd this is just the first of these.
p331
aVIn conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow I want to take you into the caldera.
p334
aVOn the left hand side there
p335
aVis a large volcano called Axial Seamount.
p336
aVAnd we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount
p337
aVusing animation.
p338
aVHere's what this system is going to look like
p339
aVthat we are funded to build at this point.
p340
aVVery powerful.
p341
aVThat's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,
p342
aVbut it can be controlled by the folks on land
p343
aVwho are responsible for it.
p344
aVOr they can transfer control
p345
aVto someone in India or China
p346
aVwho can take over for a while,
p347
aVbecause it's all going to be directly connected
p348
aVthrough the Internet.
p349
aVThere will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,
p350
aVall available to anyone who has any interest in using it.
p351
aVThis is going to be much more powerful
p352
aVthan having a single ship
p353
aVin a single location,
p354
aVthen move to a new location.
p355
aa(lp356
VWe're flying across the caldera floor.
p357
aVThere is a number of robotic systems.
p358
aVThere's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,
p359
aVif those are your experiments.
p360
aVThe kinds of systems that will be down there,
p361
aVthe kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,
p362
aVconsist of \u2014 if you can read them there \u2014
p363
aVthere's cameras, there's pressure sensors,
p364
aVfluorometers, there's seismometers.
p365
aVIt's a full spectrum of tools.
p366
aVNow, that mound right there
p367
aVactually looks like this.
p368
aVThis is what it actually looks like.
p369
aVAnd this is the kind of activity
p370
aVthat we can see with high-definition video,
p371
aVbecause the bandwidth of these cables
p372
aVis so huge
p373
aVthat we could have five to 10
p374
aVstereo HD systems
p375
aVrunning continuously
p376
aVand, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.
p377
aVVery, very powerful.
p378
aVAnd these are the things that we're funded to do today.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo what can we actually do tomorrow?
p381
aVWe're about to ride the wave
p382
aVof technological opportunity.
p383
aVThere are emerging technologies throughout
p384
aVthe field around oceanography,
p385
aVwhich we will incorporate into oceanography,
p386
aVand through that convergence,
p387
aVwe will transform oceanography into something even more magical.
p388
aVRobotics systems are just incredible these days,
p389
aVabsolutely incredible.
p390
aVAnd we will be bringing robotics of all sorts
p391
aVinto the ocean.
p392
aVNanotechnology: this is a small generator.
p393
aVIt's smaller than a postage stamp,
p394
aVand it can generate power just by being
p395
aVattached to your shirt as you move.
p396
aVJust as you move, it generates power.
p397
aVThere are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.
p398
aVImaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,
p399
aVbut stereo imaging at four times the definition
p400
aVthat we have in HD
p401
aVwill be routine within five years.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd this is the magic one.
p404
aVAs a result of the human genome process,
p405
aVwe are in a situation where
p406
aVevents that take place in the ocean \u2014
p407
aVlike an erupting volcano, or something of that sort \u2014
p408
aVcan actually be sampled.
p409
aVWe pump the fluid through one of these systems,
p410
aVand we press the button,
p411
aVand it's analyzed for the genomic character.
p412
aVAnd that's transmitted back to land immediately.
p413
aVSo in the volume of the ocean,
p414
aVwe will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,
p415
aVbut the base of the food chain
p416
aVwill be transparent to us
p417
aVwith data on a continuous basis.
p418
aVGrid computing: the power of grid computers
p419
aVis going to be just amazing here.
p420
aVWe will soon be using grid computing
p421
aVto do pretty much everything, like adjust the data
p422
aVand everything
p423
aVthat goes with the data.
p424
aVThe power generation will come from the ocean itself.
p425
aVAnd the next generation fiber
p426
aVwill be simply magic.
p427
aVIt's far beyond what we currently have.
p428
aVSo the presence of the power
p429
aVand the bandwidth in the environment
p430
aVwill allow all of these new technologies
p431
aVto converge in a manner that is just unprecedented.
p432
aa(lp433
VSo within five to seven years,
p434
aVI see us having
p435
aVa capacity to be completely present
p436
aVthroughout the ocean
p437
aVand have all of that connected to the Internet,
p438
aVso we can reach many, many folks.
p439
aVDelivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean
p440
aVwill dramatically accelerate adaptation.
p441
aVHere's an example.
p442
aVWhen earthquakes take place, massive amounts
p443
aVof these new microbes we've never seen before
p444
aVcome out of the sea floor.
p445
aVWe have a way of addressing that,
p446
aVa new way of addressing that.
p447
aVWe've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here
p448
aVthat the top of that volcano is erupting,
p449
aVso we deploy the troops.
p450
aVWhat are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.
p451
aVAnd they fly into the erupting volcano.
p452
aVThey sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor
p453
aVduring an eruption,
p454
aVwhich have the microbes that have never been
p455
aVto the surface of the planet before.
p456
aVThey eject it to the surface where it floats,
p457
aVand it is picked up
p458
aVby an autonomous airplane,
p459
aVand it's brought back to the laboratory
p460
aVwithin 24 hours of the eruption.
p461
aVThis is doable. All the pieces are there.
p462
aa(lp463
VA laboratory: many of you heard what happened
p464
aVon 9/7.
p465
aVSome doctors in New York City removed
p466
aVthe gallbladder of a woman in France.
p467
aVWe could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,
p468
aVand it would be on live TV,
p469
aVif we have interesting things to show.
p470
aVSo we can bring an entirely new telepresence
p471
aVto the world, throughout the ocean.
p472
aVThis \u2014 I've shown you sea floor \u2014
p473
aVbut so the goal here is real time interaction
p474
aVwith the oceans from anywhere on earth.
p475
aVIt's going to be amazing.
p476
aa(lp477
VAnd as I go here,
p478
