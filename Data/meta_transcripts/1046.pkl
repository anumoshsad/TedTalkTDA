VSo I am a surgeon who studies creativity,
p4
aVand I have never had a patient tell me,
p5
aV"I really want you to be creative during surgery,"
p6
aVand so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it.
p7
aVI will say though that, after having done surgery a lot,
p8
aVit's similar to playing a musical instrument.
p9
aVAnd for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound
p10
aVis what led me to both be a surgeon
p11
aVand to study the science of sound, particularly music.
p12
aVI'm going to talk over the next few minutes
p13
aVabout my career
p14
aVin terms of how I'm able to study music
p15
aVand try to grapple with all these questions
p16
aVof how the brain is able to be creative.
p17
aVI've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University,
p18
aVand at the National Institute of Health where I was previously.
p19
aVI'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments.
p20
aa(lp21
VI will start off by playing a video for you.
p22
aVThis video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser
p23
aVand probably the most well-known, iconic example
p24
aVof someone who takes improvisation to a higher level.
p25
aVAnd he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head,
p26
aVand he'll never play it exactly the same way again,
p27
aVso as a form of intense creativity,
p28
aVI think this is a great example.
p29
aVAnd so why don't we go and click the video.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Music)
p32
aa(lp33
V(Music ends)
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's really a remarkable thing that happens there.
p36
aVI've always as a listener, as a fan,
p37
aVI listen to that, and I'm astounded.
p38
aVI think \u2014 how can this possibly be?
p39
aVHow can the brain generate that much information,
p40
aVthat much music, spontaneously?
p41
aVAnd so I set out with this concept, scientifically,
p42
aVthat artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic,
p43
aVmeaning that it's a product of the brain.
p44
aVThere's not too many brain-dead people creating art.
p45
aVWith this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product,
p46
aVI took this thesis that we could study it
p47
aVjust like we study any other complex neurologic process,
p48
aVand there are subquestions that I put there.
p49
aVIs it possible to study creativity scientifically?
p50
aVAnd I think that's a good question.
p51
aVAnd I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music,
p52
aVthey're very dense,
p53
aVand when you go through them,
p54
aVit's very hard to recognize the music in it.
p55
aVIn fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely
p56
aVand to miss the point of the music.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis brings the second question:
p59
aVWhy should scientists study creativity?
p60
aVMaybe we're not the right people to do it.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VWell it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective,
p65
aVwe talked a lot about innovation today,
p66
aVthe science of innovation,
p67
aVhow much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate
p68
aVis in its infancy,
p69
aVand truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative.
p70
aVI think that we're going to see,
p71
aVover the next 10, 20, 30 years,
p72
aVa real science of creativity that's burgeoning
p73
aVand is going to flourish,
p74
aVBecause we now have new methods that can enable us
p75
aVto take this process like complex jazz improvisation,
p76
aVand study it rigorously.
p77
aVSo it gets down to the brain.
p78
aVAll of us have this remarkable brain,
p79
aVwhich is poorly understood, to say the least.
p80
aVI think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers,
p81
aVand I'm not going to give you answers today,
p82
aVjust ask a lot of questions.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd that's what I do in my lab.
p85
aVI ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this.
p86
aVThis is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI.
p87
aVIf you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same,
p88
aVbut this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain,
p89
aVbut to also take pictures of active areas of the brain.
p90
aVThe way that's done is by the following:
p91
aVThere's something called BOLD imaging,
p92
aVwhich is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging.
p93
aVWhen you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet
p94
aVthat's aligning your molecules in certain areas.
p95
aVWhen an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active,
p96
aVit gets blood flow shunted to that area.
p97
aVThat blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area
p98
aVwith a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration.
p99
aVDeoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,
p100
aVwhereas oxyhemoglobin can't.
p101
aVSo through this method of inference \u2014
p102
aVand we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity \u2014
p103
aVwe say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood
p104
aVwas active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works.
p105
aVAnd it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.
p106
aa(lp107
VI'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.
p108
aVIt was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH.
p109
aVThis is a short video of how we did this project.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard
p112
aVthat we use for the jazz experiments.
p113
aVAnd it's a 35-key keyboard
p114
aVdesigned to fit both inside the scanner,
p115
aVbe magnetically safe,
p116
aVhave minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact,
p117
aVand have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs
p118
aVwhile they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back.
p119
aVIt works like this \u2014 this doesn't actually produce any sound.
p120
aVIt sends out what's called a MIDI signal \u2014
p121
aVor a Musical Instrument Digital Interface \u2014
p122
aVthrough these wires into the box and then the computer,
p123
aVwhich then trigger high-quality piano samples like this.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Music)
p126
aa(lp127
V(Music)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Music ends)
p130
aa(lp131
VOK, so it works.
p132
aVAnd so through this piano keyboard,
p133
aVwe have the means to take a musical process and study it.
p134
aVSo what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard?
p135
aVYou can't just say, "It's great we have a keyboard."
p136
aVWe have to come up with a scientific experiment.
p137
aVThe experiment really rests on the following:
p138
aVWhat happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned,
p139
aVand what happens in the brain during something
p140
aVthat is spontaneously generated, or improvised,
p141
aVin a way that's matched motorically
p142
aVand in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?
p143
aa(lp144
VI have here what we call the paradigms.
p145
aVThere's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized,
p146
aVthen there's improvising on a scale,
p147
aVquarter notes, metronome, right hand \u2014
p148
aVscientifically very safe,
p149
aVbut musically really boring.
p150
aVThen there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm.
p151
aVSo we brought professional jazz players to the NIH,
p152
aVand we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left,
p153
aVwhich is what you heard me playing \u2014
p154
aVand we had them improvise to the same chord changes.
p155
aVAnd if you can hit that lower-right sound icon,
p156
aVthat's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Music)
p159
aa(lp160
V(Music ends)
p161
aa(lp162
VIn the end, it's not the most natural environment,
p163
aVbut they're able to play real music.
p164
aVAnd I've listened to that solo 200 times,
p165
aVand I still like it.
p166
aVAnd the musicians were comfortable in the end.
p167
aVWe first measured the number of notes.
p168
aVWere they playing more notes when they were improvising?
p169
aVThat was not what was going on.
p170
aVAnd then we looked at the brain activity.
p171
aVI will try to condense this for you.
p172
aVThese are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes
p173
aVwhen you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized.
p174
aVIn red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex,
p175
aVthe frontal lobe of the brain,
p176
aVand in blue is this area that was deactivated.
p177
aVSo we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex
p178
aVthat went way up in activity.
p179
aVWe had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex
p180
aVthat went way down in activity,
p181
aVI'll summarize that for you.
p182
aa(lp183
VThese are multifunctional areas of the brain,
p184
aVthese are not the jazz areas of the brain.
p185
aVThey do a whole host of things
p186
aVthat have to do with self-reflection,
p187
aVintrospection, working memory etc.
p188
aVReally, consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe.
p189
aVBut we have this combination
p190
aVof an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off,
p191
aVand this area that's thought to be autobiographical,
p192
aVor self-expressive, turning on.
p193
aVWe think, at least in this preliminary \u2014
p194
aVit's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study \u2014
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
Vwe think that at least a reasonable hypothesis
p199
aVis that, to be creative,
p200
aVyou should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe.
p201
aVOne area turns on, and a big area shuts off,
p202
aVso that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes,
p203
aVso that you're not constantly shutting down
p204
aVall of these new generative impulses.
p205
aVNow a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity \u2014
p206
aVsometimes it's done communicatively.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe next question was:
p209
aVWhat happens when musicians are trading back and forth,
p210
aVsomething called "trading fours,"
p211
aVwhich is something they do normally in a jazz experiment.
p212
aVSo this is a 12-bar blues,
p213
aVand I've broken it down into four-bar groups,
p214
aVso you would know how you would trade.
p215
aVWe brought a musician into the scanner, same way,
p216
aVhad them memorize this melody
p217
aVthen had another musician out in the control room
p218
aVtrading back and forth interactively.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo this is a musician, Mike Pope,
p221
aVone of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Music)
p224
aa(lp225
VHe's now playing the piece that we just saw
p226
aVa little better than I wrote it.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.
p229
aa(lp230
VMike Pope: May the force be with you.
p231
aa(lp232
VNurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?
p233
aa(lp234
VMP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.
p235
aa(lp236
VCL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VIt's kind of fun, actually.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Music)
p243
aa(lp244
VNow we're playing back and forth.
p245
aVHe's in there. You can see his legs up there.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Music)
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Music)
p252
aa(lp253
V(Music ends)
p254
aa(lp255
V(Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation
p256
aVof what it's like.
p257
aVAnd it's good that it's not too quick.
p258
aVThe fact that we do it over and over again
p259
aVlets you acclimate to your surroundings.
p260
aVSo the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing,
p261
aVlooking at my hands through two mirrors,
p262
aVlaying on my back,
p263
aVand not able to move at all except for my hand.
p264
aVThat was challenging.
p265
aVBut again \u2014
p266
aVthere were moments, for sure \u2014
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
Vthere were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.
p271
aa(lp272
VCL: At this point, I'll take a few moments.
p273
aVSo what you're seeing here \u2014
p274
aVand I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,
p275
aVwhich is to show you preliminary data.
p276
aVThis is one subject's data.
p277
aVThis is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.
p278
aVSo what am I showing you here?
p279
aVWhen he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized,
p280
aVhis language areas lit up, his Broca's area,
p281
aVin the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.
p282
aVHe had it also homologous on the right.
p283
aVThis is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication.
p284
aVThis whole notion that music is a language \u2014
p285
aVmaybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all,
p286
aVand we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation.
p287
aVSo we've done this on eight subjects now,
p288
aVand we're getting all the data together,
p289
aVhopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next?
p292
aVRap, of course, rap \u2014 freestyle.
p293
aVI've always been fascinated by freestyle.
p294
aVAnd let's play this video.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be
p297
aVRockin' it when I be, in your vicinity
p298
aVWhole-style synergy, recognize symmetry
p299
aVGo and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically
p300
aVAin't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be
p301
aVStyled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three
p302
aVWhen I say when I be, girls say bend that key cut
p303
aa(lp304
VCL: So there's a lot of analogy
p305
aVbetween what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz.
p306
aVThere are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music,
p307
aVI think, in different time periods, in lot of ways,
p308
aVrap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve.
p309
aVSo how do you study rap scientifically?
p310
aVAnd my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable.
p311
aVThis is what you do:
p312
aVYou have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap
p313
aVthat you write for them,
p314
aVthat they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle.
p315
aVSo I told my lab members that I would rap for TED,
p316
aVand they said, "No, you won't."
p317
aVAnd then I thought \u2014
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VBut here's the thing.
p324
aVWith this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK?
p325
aVSo what we had them do
p326
aVwas memorize this lower-left sound icon, please.
p327
aVThis is the control condition. This is what they memorized.
p328
aa(lp329
VComputer: Memory, thump.
p330
aa(lp331

aVMy passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed

VCL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering
p346
aVInside the mind of those unconfined
p347
aVAll of these words keep pouring out like rain
p348
aVI need a mad scientist to check my brain
p349
aa(lp350
VComputer: Stop.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VI guarantee you that will never happen again.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VSo now, what's great about these free-stylers,
p359
aVthey will get cued different words.
p360
aVThey don't know what's coming,
p361
aVbut they'll hear something off the cuff.
p362
aVGo hit that right sound icon,
p363
aVthere will be cued three square words: like, not and head.

p413
aa(lp414
VCL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain?
p415
aVThis is four rappers' brains.
p416
aVAnd we do see language areas lighting up,
p417
aVbut then, eyes closed \u2014
p418
aVwhen you are freestyling vs. memorizing,
p419
aVyou've got major visual areas lighting up.
p420
aVYou've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination.
p421
aVYou have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task,
p422
aVwhen that one task is creative and the other task is memorized.
p423
aVIt's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool.
p424
aa(lp425
VTo conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask,
p426
aVand like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them.
p427
aVBut we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically,
p428
aVand I think, with these methods, we're getting close.
p429
aVAnd I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years,
p430
aVyou'll see real, meaningful studies
p431
aVthat say science has to catch up to art,
p432
aVand maybe we're starting now to get there.
