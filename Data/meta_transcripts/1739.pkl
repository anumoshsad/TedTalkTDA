VEveryone needs a coach.
p4
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,
p5
aVa tennis player, a gymnast
p6
aVor a bridge player.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VMy bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,
p10
aVsays there are more pictures of the back of her head
p11
aVthan anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)
p12
aVSorry, Sharon. Here you go.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe all need people who will give us feedback.
p15
aVThat's how we improve.
p16
aVUnfortunately, there's one group of people
p17
aVwho get almost no systematic feedback
p18
aVto help them do their jobs better,
p19
aVand these people
p20
aVhave one of the most important jobs in the world.
p21
aVI'm talking about teachers.
p22
aVWhen Melinda and I learned
p23
aVhow little useful feedback most teachers get,
p24
aVwe were blown away.
p25
aVUntil recently, over 98 percent of teachers
p26
aVjust got one word of feedback:
p27
aVSatisfactory.
p28
aVIf all my bridge coach ever told me
p29
aVwas that I was "satisfactory,"
p30
aVI would have no hope of ever getting better.
p31
aVHow would I know who was the best?
p32
aVHow would I know what I was doing differently?
p33
aVToday, districts are revamping
p34
aVthe way they evaluate teachers,
p35
aVbut we still give them almost no feedback
p36
aVthat actually helps them improve their practice.
p37
aVOur teachers deserve better.
p38
aVThe system we have today isn't fair to them.
p39
aVIt's not fair to students,
p40
aVand it's putting America's global leadership at risk.
p41
aVSo today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers
p42
aVget the tools for improvement they want and deserve.
p43
aa(lp44
VLet's start by asking who's doing well.
p45
aVWell, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables
p46
aVfor teacher feedback systems.
p47
aVSo I looked at the countries
p48
aVwhose students perform well academically,
p49
aVand looked at what they're doing
p50
aVto help their teachers improve.
p51
aVConsider the rankings for reading proficiency.
p52
aVThe U.S. isn't number one.
p53
aVWe're not even in the top 10.
p54
aVWe're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.
p55
aVNow, out of all the places
p56
aVthat do better than the U.S. in reading,
p57
aVhow many of them have a formal system
p58
aVfor helping teachers improve?
p59
aVEleven out of 14.
p60
aVThe U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,
p61
aVbut we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.
p62
aVSo there's really only one area where we're near the top,
p63
aVand that's in failing to give our teachers
p64
aVthe help they need to develop their skills.
p65
aa(lp66
VLet's look at the best academic performer:
p67
aVthe province of Shanghai, China.
p68
aVNow, they rank number one across the board,
p69
aVin reading, math and science,
p70
aVand one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success
p71
aVis the way they help teachers keep improving.
p72
aVThey made sure that younger teachers
p73
aVget a chance to watch master teachers at work.
p74
aVThey have weekly study groups,
p75
aVwhere teachers get together and talk about what's working.
p76
aVThey even require each teacher to observe
p77
aVand give feedback to their colleagues.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou might ask, why is a system like this so important?
p80
aVIt's because there's so much variation
p81
aVin the teaching profession.
p82
aVSome teachers are far more effective than others.
p83
aVIn fact, there are teachers throughout the country
p84
aVwho are helping their students make extraordinary gains.
p85
aVIf today's average teacher
p86
aVcould become as good as those teachers,
p87
aVour students would be blowing away the rest of the world.
p88
aVSo we need a system that helps all our teachers
p89
aVbe as good as the best.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat would that system look like?
p92
aVWell, to find out, our foundation
p93
aVhas been working with 3,000 teachers
p94
aVin districts across the country
p95
aVon a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.
p96
aVWe had observers watch videos
p97
aVof teachers in the classroom
p98
aVand rate how they did on a range of practices.
p99
aVFor example, did they ask their students
p100
aVchallenging questions?
p101
aVDid they find multiple ways to explain an idea?
p102
aVWe also had students fill out surveys with questions like,
p103
aV"Does your teacher know
p104
aVwhen the class understands a lesson?"
p105
aV"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd what we found is very exciting.
p108
aVFirst, the teachers who did well on these observations
p109
aVhad far better student outcomes.
p110
aVSo it tells us we're asking the right questions.
p111
aVAnd second, teachers in the program told us
p112
aVthat these videos and these surveys from the students
p113
aVwere very helpful diagnostic tools,
p114
aVbecause they pointed to specific places
p115
aVwhere they can improve.
p116
aVI want to show you what this video component of MET
p117
aVlooks like in action.
p118

V(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.
p122
aVLet's talk about what's going on today.
p123
aVTo get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?
p124
aVA peer review day, and our goal by the end of class
p125
aVis for you to be able to determine
p126
aVwhether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.
p127
aa(lp128
VMy name is Sarah Brown Wessling.
p129
aVI am a high school English teacher
p130
aVat Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.
p131
aa(lp132
VTurn to somebody next to you.
p133
aVTell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about \u2014
p134
aa(lp135
VI think that there is a difference for teachers
p136
aVbetween the abstract of how we see our practice
p137
aVand then the concrete reality of it.
p138
aa(lp139
VOkay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.
p140
aa(lp141
VI think what video offers for us
p142
aVis a certain degree of reality.
p143
aVYou can't really dispute what you see on the video,
p144
aVand there is a lot to be learned from that,
p145
aVand there are a lot of ways that we can grow
p146
aVas a profession when we actually get to see this.
p147
aVI just have a flip camera and a little tripod
p148
aVand invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.
p149
aVAt the beginning of class, I just perch it
p150
aVin the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.
p151
aVIt doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.
p152
aVBut I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.
p153
aVAnd I'm able to learn a lot from it.
p154
aVSo it really has been a simple
p155
aVbut powerful tool in my own reflection.
p156
aa(lp157
VAll right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?
p158
aa(lp159
VOnce I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,
p160
aVand then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.
p161
aVIf I don't write things down, I don't remember them.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo having the notes is a part of my thinking process,
p164
aVand I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.
p165
aVI really have used it for my own personal growth
p166
aVand my own personal reflection on teaching strategy
p167
aVand methodology and classroom management,
p168
aVand just all of those different facets of the classroom.
p169
aa(lp170
VI'm glad that we've actually done the process before
p171
aVso we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.
p172
aa(lp173
VI think that video exposes
p174
aVso much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers
p175
aVin ways that help us learn and help us understand,
p176
aVand then help our broader communities understand
p177
aVwhat this complex work is really all about.
p178
aVI think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate
p179
aVthings that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,
p180
aVthings you cannot convey in a standard,
p181
aVthings that you cannot even sometimes convey
p182
aVin a book of pedagogy.
p183
aa(lp184
VAlrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.
p185
aVI'll see you later.
p186
aa(lp187
V[Every classroom could look like that]
p188
aa(lp189
V(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VBill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America
p192
aVto look something like that.
p193
aVBut we still have more work to do.
p194
aVDiagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve
p195
aVis only half the battle.
p196
aVWe also have to give them the tools they need
p197
aVto act on the diagnosis.
p198
aVIf you learn that you need to improve
p199
aVthe way you teach fractions,
p200
aVyou should be able to watch a video
p201
aVof the best person in the world teaching fractions.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo building this complete teacher feedback
p204
aVand improvement system won't be easy.
p205
aVFor example, I know some teachers
p206
aVaren't immediately comfortable with the idea
p207
aVof a camera in the classroom.
p208
aVThat's understandable, but our experience with MET
p209
aVsuggests that if teachers manage the process,
p210
aVif they collect video in their own classrooms,
p211
aVand they pick the lessons they want to submit,
p212
aVa lot of them will be eager to participate.
p213
aa(lp214
VBuilding this system will also require
p215
aVa considerable investment.
p216
aVOur foundation estimates that it could cost
p217
aVup to five billion dollars.
p218
aVNow that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,
p219
aVit's less than two percent
p220
aVof what we spend every year on teacher salaries.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe impact for teachers would be phenomenal.
p223
aVWe would finally have a way to give them feedback,
p224
aVas well as the means to act on it.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut this system would have
p227
aVan even more important benefit for our country.
p228
aVIt would put us on a path to making sure
p229
aVall our students get a great education,
p230
aVfind a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,
p231
aVand have a chance to live out their dreams.
p232
aVThis wouldn't just make us a more successful country.
p233
aVIt would also make us a more fair and just one, too.
p234
aa(lp235
VI'm excited about the opportunity
p236
aVto give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.
p237
aVI hope you are too.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you.
