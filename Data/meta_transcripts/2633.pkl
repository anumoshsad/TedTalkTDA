VIt's easy to forget that last night,
p4
aVone billion people went to sleep without access to electricity.
p5
aVOne billion people.
p6
aVTwo and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels
p7
aVor clean heating fuels.
p8
aVThose are the problems in the developing world.
p9
aVAnd it's easy for us not to be empathetic
p10
aVwith those people who seem so distanced from us.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut even in our own world, the developed world,
p13
aVwe see the tension of stagnant economies
p14
aVimpacting the lives of people around us.
p15
aVWe see it in whole pieces of the economy,
p16
aVwhere the people involved have lost hope about the future
p17
aVand despair about the present.
p18
aVWe see that in the Brexit vote.
p19
aVWe see that in the Sanders/Trump campaigns in my own country.
p20
aVBut even in countries as recently turning the corner
p21
aVtowards being in the developed world,
p22
aVin China,
p23
aVwe see the difficulty that President Xi has
p24
aVas he begins to un-employ so many people in his coal and mining industries
p25
aVwho see no future for themselves.
p26
aVAs we as a society figure out how to manage
p27
aVthe problems of the developed world
p28
aVand the problems of the developing world,
p29
aVwe have to look at how we move forward
p30
aVand manage the environmental impact of those decisions.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe've been working on this problem for 25 years, since Rio,
p33
aVthe Kyoto Protocols.
p34
aVOur most recent move is the Paris treaty,
p35
aVand the resulting climate agreements
p36
aVthat are being ratified by nations around the world.
p37
aVI think we can be very hopeful
p38
aVthat those agreements, which are bottom-up agreements,
p39
aVwhere nations have said what they think they can do,
p40
aVare genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties.
p41
aVThe unfortunate thing
p42
aVis that now, as we look at the independent analyses
p43
aVof what those climate treaties are liable to yield,
p44
aVthe magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis is the United States Energy Information Agency's assessment
p47
aVof what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments
p48
aVthat they've made in Paris
p49
aVbetween now and 2040.
p50
aVIt shows basically CO2 emissions around the world
p51
aVover the next 30 years.
p52
aVThere are three things that you need to look at and appreciate.
p53
aa(lp54
VOne, CO2 emissions are expected to continue to grow
p55
aVfor the next 30 years.
p56
aVIn order to control climate,
p57
aVCO2 emissions have to literally go to zero
p58
aVbecause it's the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet.
p59
aVThis should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe second thing you should notice
p62
aVis that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries,
p63
aVfrom China, from India, from the rest of the world,
p64
aVwhich includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil,
p65
aVas most of these countries move their people
p66
aVinto the lower range of lifestyles
p67
aVthat we literally take for granted in the developed world.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe final thing that you should notice
p70
aVis that each year,
p71
aVabout 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet's atmosphere,
p72
aVand then diffusing into the ocean and into the land.
p73
aVThat's on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today.
p74
aVAt the end of 30 years,
p75
aVwe will have put 850 gigatons of carbon into the air,
p76
aVand that probably goes a long way
p77
aVtowards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean surface temperatures,
p78
aVlocking in ocean acidification
p79
aVand locking in sea level rise.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, this is a projection made by men
p82
aVby the actions of society,
p83
aVand it's ours to change, not to accept.
p84
aVBut the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate.
p85
aa(lp86
VDifferent nations make different energy choices.
p87
aVIt's a function of their natural resources.
p88
aVIt's a function of their climate.
p89
aVIt's a function of the development path that they've followed as a society.
p90
aVIt's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are.
p91
aVAre they where it's dark a lot of the time,
p92
aVor are they at the mid-latitudes?
p93
aVMany, many, many things go into the choices of countries,
p94
aVand they each make a different choice.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate
p97
aVis the choice that China has made.
p98
aVChina has made the choice,
p99
aVand will make the choice, to run on coal.
p100
aVThe United States has an alternative.
p101
aVIt can run on natural gas
p102
aVas a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas,
p103
aVwhich we have here.
p104
aVThey provide an alternative.
p105
aVThe OECD Europe has a choice.
p106
aVIt has renewables that it can afford to deploy in Germany
p107
aVbecause it's rich enough to afford to do it.
p108
aVThe French and the British show interest in nuclear power.
p109
aVEastern Europe, still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal,
p110
aVand with natural gas that comes from Russia,
p111
aVwith all of its entanglements.
p112
aVChina has many fewer choices
p113
aVand a much harder row to hoe.
p114
aa(lp115
VIf you look at China, and you ask yourself
p116
aVwhy has coal been important to it,
p117
aVyou have to remember what China's done.
p118
aVChina brought people to power, not power to people.
p119
aVIt didn't do rural electrification.
p120
aVIt urbanized.
p121
aVIt urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy,
p122
aVcreating export industries
p123
aVthat could fund a tremendous amount of growth.
p124
aa(lp125
VIf we look at China's path,
p126
aVall of us know that prosperity in China has dramatically increased.
p127
aVIn 1980, 80 percent of China's population
p128
aVlived below the extreme poverty level,
p129
aVbelow the level of having $1.90 per person per day.
p130
aVBy the year 2000, only 20 percent of China's population
p131
aVlived below the extreme poverty level \u2014
p132
aVa remarkable feat,
p133
aVadmittedly, with some costs in civil liberties
p134
aVthat would be tough to accept in the Western world.
p135
aVBut the impact of all that wealth
p136
aVallowed people to get massively better nutrition.
p137
aVIt allowed water pipes to be placed.
p138
aVIt allowed sewage pipes to be placed,
p139
aVdramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,
p140
aVat the cost of some outdoor air pollution.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut in 1980, and even today,
p143
aVthe number one killer in China is indoor air pollution,
p144
aVbecause people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels.
p145
aVIn fact, in 2040,
p146
aVit's still estimated that 200 million people in China
p147
aVwill not have access to clean cooking fuels.
p148
aVThey have a remarkable path to follow.
p149
aa(lp150
VIndia also needs to meet the needs of its own people,
p151
aVand it's going to do that by burning coal.
p152
aVWhen we look at the EIA's projections of coal burning in India,
p153
aVIndia will supply nearly four times as much of its energy from coal
p154
aVas it will from renewables.
p155
aVIt's not because they don't know the alternatives;
p156
aVit's because rich countries can do what they choose,
p157
aVpoor countries do what they must.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo what can we do to stop coal's emissions in time?
p160
aVWhat can we do that changes this forecast that's in front of us?
p161
aVBecause it's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it.
p162
aa(lp163
VFirst of all, we have to think about the magnitude of the problem.
p164
aVBetween now and 2040,
p165
aV800 to 1,600 new coal plants are going to be built around the world.
p166
aVThis week, between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants
p167
aVare being turned on around the world.
p168
aVThat's happening regardless of what we want,
p169
aVbecause the people that rule their countries,
p170
aVassessing the interests of their citizens,
p171
aVhave decided it's in the interest of their citizens to do that.
p172
aVAnd that's going to happen unless they have a better alternative.
p173
aVAnd every 100 of those plants will use up
p174
aVbetween one percent and three percent
p175
aVof the Earth's climate budget.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo every day that you go home thinking that you should do something
p178
aVabout global warming,
p179
aVat the end of that week, remember:
p180
aVsomebody fired up a coal plant that's going to run for 50 years
p181
aVand take away your ability to change it.
p182
aa(lp183
VWhat we've forgotten is something that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,
p184
aVa man of Indian ethnicity but an American venture capitalist.
p185
aVAnd he said, back in the early 2000s,
p186
aVthat if you needed to get China and India off of fossil fuels,
p187
aVyou had to create a technology that passed the "Chindia test,"
p188
aV"Chindia" being the appending of the two words.
p189
aVIt had to be first of all viable,
p190
aVmeaning that technically, they could implement it in their country,
p191
aVand that it would be accepted by the people in the country.
p192
aa(lp193
VTwo, it had to be a technology that was scalable,
p194
aVthat it could deliver the same benefits
p195
aVon the same timetable as fossil fuels,
p196
aVso that they can enjoy the kind of life, again, that we take for granted.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd third, it had to be cost-effective
p199
aVwithout subsidy or without mandate.
p200
aVIt had to stand on its own two feet;
p201
aVit could not be maintained for that many people
p202
aVif in fact, those countries had to go begging
p203
aVor had some foreign country say, "I won't trade with you,"
p204
aVin order to get the technology shift to occur.
p205
aa(lp206
VIf you look at the Chindia test,
p207
aVwe simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test.
p208
aVThat's what the EIA forecast tells us.
p209
aVChina's building 800 gigawatts of coal,
p210
aV400 gigawatts of hydro,
p211
aVabout 200 gigawatts of nuclear,
p212
aVand on an energy-equivalent basis, adjusting for intermittency,
p213
aVabout 100 gigawatts of renewables.
p214
aV800 gigawatts of coal.
p215
aVThey're doing that, knowing the costs better than any other country,
p216
aVknowing the need better than any other country.
p217
aVBut that's what they're aiming for in 2040
p218
aVunless we give them a better choice.
p219
aVTo give them a better choice,
p220
aVit's going to have to meet the Chindia test.
p221
aa(lp222
VIf you look at all the alternatives that are out there,
p223
aVthere are really two that come near to meeting it.
p224
aVFirst is this area of new nuclear that I'll talk about in just a second.
p225
aVIt's a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards
p226
aVaround the world,
p227
aVand the people who are developing these say
p228
aVwe can get them in position to demo by 2025
p229
aVand to scale by 2030, if you will just let us.
p230
aVThe second alternative that could be there in time
p231
aVis utility-scale solar backed up with natural gas,
p232
aVwhich we can use today,
p233
aVversus the batteries which are still under development.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo what's holding new nuclear back?
p236
aVOutdated regulations and yesterday's mindsets.
p237
aVWe have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health
p238
aVto think how we communicate with the public
p239
aVand govern the testing of new nuclear reactors.
p240
aVWe have new scientific knowledge that we need to use
p241
aVin order to improve the way we regulate nuclear industry.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe second thing is we've got a mindset
p244
aVthat it takes 25 years and 2 to 5 billion dollars
p245
aVto develop a nuclear power plant.
p246
aVThat comes from the historical, military mindset
p247
aVof the places nuclear power came from.
p248
aVThese new nuclear ventures are saying
p249
aVthat they can deliver power for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;
p250
aVthey can deliver it for 100 gigawatts a year;
p251
aVthey can demo it by 2025;
p252
aVand they can deliver it in scale by 2030,
p253
aVif only we give them a chance.
p254
aa(lp255
VRight now, we're basically waiting for a miracle.
p256
aVWhat we need is a choice.
p257
aVIf they can't make it safe, if they can't make it cheap,
p258
aVit should not be deployed.
p259
aVBut what I want you to do is not carry an idea forward,
p260
aVbut write your leaders,
p261
aVwrite the head of the NGOs you support,
p262
aVand tell them to give you the choice,
p263
aVnot the past.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you very much.
