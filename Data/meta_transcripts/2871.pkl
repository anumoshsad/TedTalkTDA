VToday I'm here, actually, to pose you a question.
p4
aVWhat is life?
p5
aVIt has been really puzzling me for more than 25 years,
p6
aVand will probably continue doing so for the next 25 years.
p7
aVThis is the thesis I did when I was still in undergraduate school.
p8
aVWhile my colleagues still treated computers as big calculators,
p9
aVI started to teach computers to learn.
p10
aVI built digital lady beetles
p11
aVand tried to learn from real lady beetles, just to do one thing:
p12
aVsearch for food.
p13
aVAnd after very simple neural network \u2014
p14
aVgenetic algorithms and so on \u2014
p15
aVlook at the pattern.
p16
aVThey're almost identical to real life.
p17
aVA very striking learning experience for a twenty-year-old.
p18
aa(lp19
VLife is a learning program.
p20
aVWhen you look at all of this wonderful world,
p21
aVevery species has its own learning program.
p22
aVThe learning program is genome,
p23
aVand the code of that program is DNA.
p24
aVThe different genomes of each species represent different survival strategies.
p25
aVThey represent hundreds of millions of years of evolution.
p26
aVThe interaction between every species' ancestor
p27
aVand the environment.
p28
aa(lp29
VI was really fascinated about the world,
p30
aVabout the DNA,
p31
aVabout, you know, the language of life,
p32
aVthe program of learning.
p33
aVSo I decided to co-found the institute to read them.
p34
aVI read many of them.
p35
aVWe probably read more than half of the prior animal genomes in the world.
p36
aVI mean, up to date.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe did learn a lot.
p39
aVWe did sequence, also, one species many, many times ...
p40
aVhuman genome.
p41
aVWe sequenced the first Asian.
p42
aVI sequenced it myself many, many times,
p43
aVjust to take advantage of that platform.
p44
aVLook at all those repeating base pairs:
p45
aVATCG.
p46
aVYou don't understand anything there.
p47
aVBut look at that one base pair.
p48
aVThose five letters, the AGGAA.
p49
aVThese five SNPs represent a very specific haplotype
p50
aVin the Tibetan population
p51
aVaround the gene called EPAS1.
p52
aVThat gene has been proved \u2014
p53
aVit's highly selective \u2014
p54
aVit's the most significant signature of positive selection of Tibetans
p55
aVfor the higher altitude adaptation.
p56
aVYou know what?
p57
aVThese five SNPs were the result of integration of Denisovans,
p58
aVor Denisovan-like individuals into humans.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is the reason why we need to read those genomes.
p61
aVTo understand history,
p62
aVto understand what kind of learning process
p63
aVthe genome has been through for the millions of years.
p64
aVBy reading a genome, it can give you a lot of information \u2014
p65
aVtells you the bugs in the genome \u2014
p66
aVI mean, birth defects, monogenetic disorders.
p67
aVReading a drop of blood
p68
aVcould tell you why you got a fever,
p69
aVor it tells you which medicine and dosage needs to be used
p70
aVwhen you're sick, especially for cancer.
p71
aa(lp72
VA lot of things could be studied, but look at that:
p73
aV30 years ago, we were still poor in China.
p74
aVOnly .67 percent of the Chinese adult population had diabetes.
p75
aVLook at now: 11 percent.
p76
aVGenetics cannot change over 30 years \u2014
p77
aVonly one generation.
p78
aVIt must be something different.
p79
aVDiet?
p80
aVThe environment?
p81
aVLifestyle?
p82
aVEven identical twins could develop totally differently.
p83
aVIt could be one becomes very obese, the other is not.
p84
aVOne develops a cancer and the other does not.
p85
aVNot mentioning living in a very stressed environment.
p86
aa(lp87
VI moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...
p88
aVfor some reason, people may know.
p89
aVIf the gene's under stress,
p90
aVit behaves totally differently.
p91
aVLife is a journey.
p92
aVA gene is just a starting point,
p93
aVnot the end.
p94
aVYou have this statistical risk of certain diseases when you are born.
p95
aVBut every day you make different choices,
p96
aVand those choices will increase or decrease the risk of certain diseases.
p97
aVBut do you know where you are on the curve?
p98
aVWhat's the past curve look like?
p99
aVWhat kind of decisions are you facing every day?
p100
aVAnd what kind of decision is the right one
p101
aVto make your own right curve over your life journey?
p102
aVWhat's that?
p103
aa(lp104
VThe only thing you cannot change,
p105
aVyou cannot reverse back,
p106
aVis time.
p107
aVProbably not yet; maybe in the future.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VWell, you cannot change the decision you've made,
p112
aVbut can we do something there?
p113
aVCan we actually try to run multiple options on me,
p114
aVand try to predict right on the consequence,
p115
aVand be able to make the right choice?
p116
aVAfter all,
p117
aVwe are our choices.
p118
aa(lp119
VThese lady beetles came to me afterwards.
p120
aV25 years ago, I made the digital lady beetles
p121
aVto try to simulate real lady beetles.
p122
aVCan I make a digital me ...
p123
aVto simulate me?
p124
aVI understand the neural network could become
p125
aVmuch more sophisticated and complicated there.
p126
aVCan I make that one,
p127
aVand try to run multiple options on that digital me \u2014
p128
aVto compute that?
p129
aVThen I could live in different universes,
p130
aVin parallel, at the same time.
p131
aVThen I would choose whatever is good for me.
p132
aa(lp133
VI probably have the most comprehensive digital me on the planet.
p134
aVI've spent a lot of dollars on me, on myself.
p135
aVAnd the digital me told me I have a genetic risk of gout
p136
aVby all of those things there.
p137
aVYou need different technology to do that.
p138
aVYou need the proteins, genes,
p139
aVyou need metabolized antibodies,
p140
aVyou need to screen all your body
p141
aVabout the bacterias and viruses covering you, or in you.
p142
aVYou need to have all the smart devices there \u2014
p143
aVsmart cars, smart house, smart tables,
p144
aVsmart watch, smart phone to track all of your activities there.
p145
aVThe environment is important \u2014
p146
aVeverything's important \u2014
p147
aVand don't forget the smart toilet.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VIt's such a waste, right?
p152
aVEvery day, so much invaluable information just has been flushed into the water.
p153
aVAnd you need them.
p154
aVYou need to measure all of them.
p155
aVYou need to be able to measure everything around you
p156
aVand compute them.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd the digital me told me I have a genetic defect.
p159
aVI have a very high risk of gout.
p160
aVI don't feel anything now,
p161
aVI'm still healthy.
p162
aVBut look at my uric acid level.
p163
aVIt's double the normal range.
p164
aVAnd the digital me searched all the medicine books,
p165
aVand it tells me, "OK, you could drink burdock tea" \u2014
p166
aVI cannot even pronounce it right \u2014
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VThat is from old Chinese wisdom.
p171
aVAnd I drank that tea for three months.
p172
aVMy uric acid has now gone back to normal.
p173
aVI mean, it worked for me.
p174
aa(lp175
VAll those thousands of years of wisdom worked for me.
p176
aVI was lucky.
p177
aVBut I'm probably not lucky for you.
p178
aVAll of this existing knowledge in the world
p179
aVcannot possibly be efficient enough or personalized enough for yourself.
p180
aVThe only way to make that digital me work ...
p181
aVis to learn from yourself.
p182
aVYou have to ask a lot of questions about yourself:
p183
aV"What if?" \u2014
p184
aa(lp185
VI'm being jet-lagged now here.
p186
aVYou don't probably see it, but I do.
p187
aVWhat if I eat less?
p188
aVWhen I took metformin, supposedly to live longer?
p189
aVWhat if I climb Mt. Everest?
p190
aVIt's not that easy.
p191
aVOr run a marathon?
p192
aVWhat if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,
p193
aVwhich is a Chinese liquor,
p194
aVand I get really drunk?
p195
aVI was doing a video rehearsal last time with the folks here,
p196
aVwhen I was drunk,
p197
aVand I totally delivered a different speech.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat if I work less, right?
p202
aVI have been less stressed, right?
p203
aVSo that probably never happened to me,
p204
aVI was really stressed every day,
p205
aVbut I hope I could be less stressed.
p206
aVThese early studies told us,
p207
aVeven with the same banana,
p208
aVwe have totally different glucose-level reactions
p209
aVover different individuals.
p210
aa(lp211
VHow about me?
p212
aVWhat is the right breakfast for me?
p213
aVI need to do two weeks of controlled experiments,
p214
aVof testing all kinds of different food ingredients on me,
p215
aVand check my body's reaction.
p216
aVAnd I don't know the precise nutrition for me,
p217
aVfor myself.
p218
aa(lp219
VThen I wanted to search all the Chinese old wisdom
p220
aVabout how I can live longer, and healthier.
p221
aVI did it.
p222
aVSome of them are really unachievable.
p223
aVI did this once last October,
p224
aVby not eating for seven days.
p225
aVI did a fast for seven days with six partners of mine.
p226
aVLook at those people.
p227
aVOne smile.
p228
aVYou know why he smiled?
p229
aVHe cheated.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VHe drank one cup of coffee at night,
p234
aVand we caught it from the data.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VWe measured everything from the data.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe were able to track them,
p241
aVand we could really see \u2014
p242
aVfor example, my immune system,
p243
aVjust to give you a little hint there.
p244
aVMy immune system changed dramatically over 24 hours there.
p245
aVAnd my antibody regulates my proteins
p246
aVfor that dramatic change.
p247
aVAnd everybody was doing that.
p248
aVEven if we're essentially totally different at the very beginning.
p249
aVAnd that probably will be an interesting treatment in the future
p250
aVfor cancer and things like that.
p251
aa(lp252
VIt becomes very, very interesting.
p253
aVBut something you probably don't want to try,
p254
aVlike drinking fecal water from a healthier individual,
p255
aVwhich will make you feel healthier.
p256
aVThis is from old Chinese wisdom.
p257
aVLook at that, right?
p258
aVLike 1,700 years ago,
p259
aVit's already there, in the book.
p260
aVBut I still hate the smell.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VI want to find out the true way to do it,
p265
aVmaybe find a combination of cocktails of bacterias and drink it,
p266
aVit probably will make me better.
p267
aVSo I'm trying to do that.
p268
aa(lp269
VEven though I'm trying this hard,
p270
aVit's so difficult to test out all possible conditions.
p271
aVIt's not possible to do all kinds of experiments at all ...
p272
aVbut we do have seven billion learning programs on this planet.
p273
aVSeven billion.
p274
aVAnd every program is running in different conditions
p275
aVand doing different experiments.
p276
aVCan we all measure them?
p277
aa(lp278
VSeven years ago, I wrote an essay in "Science"
p279
aVto celebrate the human genome's 10-year anniversary.
p280
aVI said, "Sequence yourself,
p281
aVfor one and for all."
p282
aVBut now I'm going to say,
p283
aV"Digitalize yourself for one and for all."
p284
aVWhen we make this digital me into a digital we,
p285
aVwhen we try to form an internet of life,
p286
aVwhen people can learn from each other,
p287
aVwhen people can learn from their experience,
p288
aVtheir data,
p289
aVwhen people can really form a digital me by themselves
p290
aVand we learn from it,
p291
aVthe digital we will be totally different with a digital me.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut it can only come from the digital me.
p294
aVAnd this is what I try to propose here.
p295
aVJoin me \u2014
p296
aVbecome we,
p297
aVand everybody should build up their own digital me,
p298
aVbecause only by that will you learn more about you,
p299
aVabout me,
p300
aVabout us ...
p301
aVabout the question I just posed at the very beginning:
p302
aV"What is life?"
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VChris Anderson: One quick question for you.
p309
aVI mean, the work is amazing.
p310
aVI suspect one question people have is,
p311
aVas we look forward to these amazing technical possibilities
p312
aVof personalized medicine,
p313
aVin the near-term it feels like they're only going to be affordable
p314
aVfor a few people, right?
p315
aVIt costs many dollars to do all the sequencing and so forth.
p316
aVIs this going to lead to a kind of,
p317
aVyou know, increasing inequality?
p318
aVOr do you have this vision that the knowledge that you get
p319
aVfrom the pioneers
p320
aVcan actually be pretty quickly disseminated
p321
aVto help a broader set of recipients?
p322
aa(lp323
VJun Wang: Well, good question.
p324
aVI'll tell you that seven years ago, when I co-founded BGI,
p325
aVand served as the CEO of the company there,
p326
aVthe only goal there for me to do
p327
aVwas to drive the sequencing cost down.
p328
aVIt started from 100 million dollars per human genome.
p329
aVNow, it's a couple hundred dollars for a human genome.
p330
aVThe only reason to do it is to get more people to benefit from it.
p331
aVSo for the digital me, it's the same thing.
p332
aVNow, you probably need,
p333
aVyou know, one million dollars to digitize a person.
p334
aVI think it has to be 100 dollars.
p335
aVIt has to be free for many of those people that urgently need that.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo this is our goal.
p338
aVAnd it seems that with all this merging of the technology,
p339
aVI'm thinking that in the very near future,
p340
aVlet's say three to five years,
p341
aVit will come to reality.
p342
aVAnd this is the whole idea of why I founded iCarbonX,
p343
aVmy second company.
p344
aVIt's really trying to get the cost down
p345
aVto a level where every individual could have the benefit.
p346
aa(lp347
VCA: All right, so the dream is not elite health services for few,
p348
aVit's to really try
p349
aVand actually make overall health care much more cost effective \u2014
p350
aa(lp351
VJW: But we started from some early adopters,
p352
aVpeople believing ideas and so on,
p353
aVbut eventually, it will become everybody's benefit.
p354
aa(lp355
VCA: Well, Jun, I think it's got to be true to say
p356
aVyou're one of the most amazing scientific minds on the planet,
p357
aVand it's an honor to have you.
p358
aa(lp359
VJW: Thank you.
