VEric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman doesn't need much of an introduction,
p4
aVbut TED's audience is global,
p5
aVit's diverse,
p6
aVso I've been tasked with starting with his bio,
p7
aVwhich could easily take up the entire 18 minutes.
p8
aVSo instead we're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VYou were born in New Hampshire.
p13
aa(lp14
VNorman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.
p15
aa(lp16
VEH: New Haven, Connecticut.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VNL: There goes seven more seconds.
p21
aa(lp22
VEH: Nailed it.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VYou were born in New Haven, Connecticut.
p27
aVYour father was a con man \u2014 I got that right.
p28
aVHe was taken away to prison when you were nine years old.
p29
aVYou flew 52 missions as a fighter pilot in World War II.
p30
aVYou came back to \u2014
p31
aa(lp32
VNL: Radio operator.
p33
aa(lp34
VEH: You came to LA to break into Hollywood,
p35
aVfirst in publicity, then in TV.
p36
aVYou had no training as a writer, formally,
p37
aVbut you hustled your way in.
p38
aVYour breakthrough, your debut,
p39
aVwas a little show called "All in the Family."
p40
aVYou followed that up with a string of hits
p41
aVthat to this day is unmatched in Hollywood:
p42
aV"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"
p43
aV"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"
p44
aV"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"
p45
aVto name literally a fraction of them.
p46
aVNot only are they all commercially \u2014
p47
aa(lp48
V(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VNot only are they all commercially successful,
p51
aVbut many of them push our culture forward
p52
aVby giving the underrepresented members of society
p53
aVtheir first prime-time voice.
p54
aVYou have seven shows in the top 10 at one time.
p55
aVAt one point,
p56
aVyou aggregate an audience of 120 million people per week
p57
aVwatching your content.
p58
aVThat's more than the audience for Super Bowl 50,
p59
aVwhich happens once a year.
p60
aa(lp61
VNL: Holy shit.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VEH: And we're not even to the holy shit part.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VYou land yourself on Richard Nixon's enemies list \u2014
p72
aVhe had one.
p73
aa(lp74
VThat's an applause line, too.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Applause)
p77
aa(lp78
VYou're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame on the first day that it exists.
p79
aVThen came the movies.
p80
aV"Fried Green Tomatoes,"
p81
aV"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"
p82
aV"This Is Spinal Tap."
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VAgain, just to name a fraction.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause)
p89
aa(lp90
VThen you wipe the slate clean,
p91
aVstart a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the First Amendment
p92
aVand the separation of church and state.
p93
aVYou start People For The American Way.
p94
aVYou buy the Declaration of Independence
p95
aVand give it back to the people.
p96
aVYou stay active in both entertainment and politics
p97
aVuntil the ripe old of age of 93,
p98
aVwhen you write a book
p99
aVand make a documentary about your life story.
p100
aVAnd after all that,
p101
aVthey finally think you're ready for a TED Talk.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VNL: I love being here.
p108
aVAnd I love you for agreeing to do this.
p109
aa(lp110
VEH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.
p111
aVSo here's my first question.
p112
aVWas your mother proud of you?
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VNL: My mother ...
p117
aVwhat a place to start.
p118
aVLet me put it this way \u2014
p119
aVwhen I came back from the war,
p120
aVshe showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas,
p121
aVand they were absolute love letters.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VThis really sums up my mother.
p126
aVThey were love letters,
p127
aVas if I had written them to \u2014
p128
aVthey were love letters.
p129
aVA year later I asked my mother if I could have them,
p130
aVbecause I'd like to keep them all the years of my life ...
p131
aVShe had thrown them away.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThat's my mother.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VThe best way I can sum it up in more recent times is \u2014
p140
aVthis is also more recent times \u2014
p141
aVa number of years ago,
p142
aVwhen they started the Hall of Fame to which you referred.
p143
aVIt was a Sunday morning,
p144
aVwhen I got a call from the fellow who ran the TV Academy of Arts & Sciences.
p145
aVHe was calling me to tell me they had met all day yesterday
p146
aVand he was confidentially telling me they were going to start a hall of fame
p147
aVand these were the inductees.
p148
aVI started to say "Richard Nixon,"
p149
aVbecause Richard Nixon \u2014
p150
aa(lp151
VEH: I don't think he was on their list.
p152
aa(lp153
VNL: William Paley, who started CBS,
p154
aVDavid Sarnoff, who started NBC,
p155
aVEdward R. Murrow,
p156
aVthe greatest of the foreign correspondents,
p157
aVPaddy Chayefsky \u2014
p158
aVI think the best writer that ever came out of television \u2014
p159
aVMilton Berle, Lucille Ball
p160
aVand me.
p161
aa(lp162
VEH: Not bad.
p163
aa(lp164
VNL: I call my mother immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.
p165
aV"Mom, this is what's happened,
p166
aVthey're starting a hall of fame."
p167
aa(lp168
VI tell her the list of names and me,
p169
aVand she says,
p170
aV"Listen, if that's what they want to do, who am I to say?"
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VThat's my Ma.
p177
aVI think it earns that kind of a laugh
p178
aVbecause everybody has a piece of that mother.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VEH: And the sitcom Jewish mother is born, right there.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo your father also played a large role in your life,
p185
aVmostly by his absence.
p186
aa(lp187
VNL: Yeah.
p188
aa(lp189
VEH: Tell us what happened when you were nine years old.
p190
aa(lp191
VNL: He was flying to Oklahoma
p192
aVwith three guys that my mother said,
p193
aV"I don't want you to have anything to do with them,
p194
aVI don't trust those men."
p195
aVThat's when I heard,
p196
aVmaybe not for the first time,
p197
aV"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."
p198
aVAnd he went.
p199
aVIt turns out he was picking up some fake bonds,
p200
aVwhich he was flying across the country to sell.
p201
aVBut the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane,
p202
aVand he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat,
p203
aVjust like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore.
p204
aVYou know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.
p205
aVI mean, it was exotic that my father was going there.
p206
aVBut when he came back,
p207
aVthey arrested him as he got off the plane.
p208
aa(lp209
VThat night newspapers were all over the house,
p210
aVmy father was with his hat in front of his face,
p211
aVmanacled to a detective.
p212
aVAnd my mother was selling the furniture, because we were leaving \u2014
p213
aVshe didn't want to stay in that state of shame,
p214
aVin Chelsea, Massachusetts.
p215
aVAnd selling the furniture \u2014
p216
aVthe house was loaded with people.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd in the middle of all of that,
p219
aVsome strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said,
p220
aV"Well, you're the man of the house now."
p221
aVI'm crying, and this asshole says, "You're the man of the house now."
p222
aVAnd I think that was the moment
p223
aVI began to understand the foolishness of the human condition.
p224
aVSo ...
p225
aVit took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a benefit.
p226
aVBut \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
VEH: It's interesting you call it a benefit.
p229
aa(lp230
VNL: Benefit in that it gave me that springboard.
p231
aVI mean that I could think
p232
aVhow foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy,
p233
aV"You're the man of the house now."
p234
aVAnd then I was crying, and then he said,
p235
aV"And men of the house don't cry."
p236
aVAnd I ...
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VSo ...
p241
aVI look back, and I think
p242
aVthat's when I learned the foolishness of the human condition,
p243
aVand it's been that gift that I've used.
p244
aa(lp245
VEH: So you have a father who's absent,
p246
aVyou have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough.
p247
aVDo you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard
p248
aVstarted you down a journey
p249
aVthat ended with you being an adult
p250
aVwith a weekly audience of 120 million people?
p251
aa(lp252
VNL: I love the way you put that question,
p253
aVbecause I guess I've spent my life wanting \u2014
p254
aVif anything, wanting to be heard.
p255
aVI think \u2014
p256
aVIt's a simple answer, yes,
p257
aVthat was what sparked \u2014
p258
aVwell, there were other things, too.
p259
aVWhen my father was away,
p260
aVI was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together,
p261
aVand I caught a signal that turned out to be Father Coughlin.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VYeah, somebody laughed.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VBut not funny,
p270
aVthis was a horse's \u2014
p271
aVanother horse's ass \u2014
p272
aVwho was very vocal about hating the New Deal
p273
aVand Roosevelt and Jews.
p274
aVThe first time I ran into an understanding
p275
aVthat there were people in this world that hated me
p276
aVbecause I was born to Jewish parents.
p277
aVAnd that had an enormous effect on my life.
p278
aa(lp279
VEH: So you had a childhood
p280
aVwith little in the way of strong male role models,
p281
aVexcept for your grandfather.
p282
aVTell us about him.
p283
aa(lp284
VNL: Oh, my grandfather.
p285
aVWell here's the way I always talked about that grandfather.
p286
aVThere were parades,
p287
aVlots of parades when I was a kid.
p288
aVThere were parades on Veteran's Day \u2014
p289
aVthere wasn't a President's Day.
p290
aVThere was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,
p291
aVGeorge Washington's birthday
p292
aVand Flag Day ...
p293
aVAnd lots of little parades.
p294
aVMy grandfather used to take me
p295
aVand we'd stand on the street corner,
p296
aVhe'd hold my hand,
p297
aVand I'd look up and I'd see a tear running down his eye.
p298
aVAnd he meant a great deal to me.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd he used to write presidents of the United States.
p301
aVEvery letter started,
p302
aV"My dearest, darling Mr. President,"
p303
aVand he'd tell him something wonderful about what he did.
p304
aVBut when he disagreed with the President, he also wrote,
p305
aV"My dearest, darling Mr. President,
p306
aVDidn't I tell you last week ...?"
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I would run down the stairs every now and then
p311
aVand pick up the mail.
p312
aVWe were three flights up,
p313
aV74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.
p314
aVAnd I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, "Shya C. called at this address."
p315
aVAnd that's the story I have told about my grandfather \u2014
p316
aa(lp317
VEH: They wrote him back on the envelopes \u2014
p318
aa(lp319
VNL: They wrote back.
p320
aVBut I have shown them myself,
p321
aVgoing way back to Phil Donahue and others before him,
p322
aVliterally dozens of interviews in which I told that story.
p323
aVThis will be the second time I have said the whole story was a lie.
p324
aVThe truth was my grandfather took me to parades,
p325
aVwe had lots of those.
p326
aVThe truth is a tear came down his eye.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe truth is he would write an occasional letter,
p329
aVand I did pick up those little envelopes.
p330
aVBut "My dearest darling Mr. President,"
p331
aVall the rest of it,
p332
aVis a story I borrowed from a good friend
p333
aVwhose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters.
p334
aVAnd, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather
p335
aVand made him my own.
p336
aVAlways.
p337
aa(lp338
VWhen I started to write my memoir \u2014
p339
aV"Even this \u2014"
p340
aVHow about that?
p341
aV"Even This I Get to Experience."
p342
aVWhen I started to write the memoir
p343
aVand I started to think about it,
p344
aVand then I \u2014
p345
aVI \u2014
p346
aVI did a reasonable amount of crying,
p347
aVand I realized how much I needed the father.
p348
aVSo much so that I appropriated Arthur Marshall's grandfather.
p349
aVSo much so, the word "father" \u2014
p350
aVI have six kids by the way.
p351
aVMy favorite role in life.
p352
aVIt and husband to my wife Lyn.
p353
aVBut I stole the man's identity because I needed the father.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow I've gone through a whole lot of shit
p356
aVand come out on the other side,
p357
aVand I forgive my father \u2014
p358
aVthe best thing I \u2014
p359
aVthe worst thing I \u2014
p360
aVThe word I'd like to use about him and think about him is \u2014
p361
aVhe was a rascal.
p362
aVThe fact that he lied and stole and cheated
p363
aVand went to prison ...
p364
aVI submerge that in the word "rascal."
p365
aa(lp366
VEH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal.
p367
aa(lp368
VNL: I'm a pro.
p369
aa(lp370
VEH: You're a pro.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd that quote is widely attributed to John Lennon,
p375
aVbut it turns out he stole it from T.S. Eliot.
p376
aVSo you're in good company.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VEH: I want to talk about your work.
p381
aVObviously the impact of your work has been written about
p382
aVand I'm sure you've heard about it all your life:
p383
aVwhat it meant to people,
p384
aVwhat it meant to our culture,
p385
aVyou heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows,
p386
aVyou raised half the people in the room through your work.
p387
aVBut have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work
p388
aVthat surprised you?
p389
aa(lp390
VNL: Oh, god \u2014
p391
aVsurprised me and delighted me from head to toe.
p392
aVThere was "An Evening with Norman Lear" within the last year
p393
aVthat a group of hip-hop impresarios,
p394
aVperformers and the Academy put together.
p395
aVThe subtext of "An Evening with ..."
p396
aVwas: What do a 92-year-old Jew \u2014
p397
aVthen 92 \u2014
p398
aVand the world of hip-hop have in common?
p399
aVRussell Simmons was among seven on the stage.
p400
aVAnd when he talked about the shows,
p401
aVhe wasn't talking about the Hollywood,
p402
aVGeorge Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,"
p403
aVor the show that was a number five show.
p404
aVHe was talking about a simple thing that made a big \u2014
p405
aa(lp406
VEH: Impact on him?
p407
aa(lp408
VNL: An impact on him \u2014
p409
aVI was hesitating over the word, "change."
p410
aVIt's hard for me to imagine,
p411
aVyou know, changing somebody's life,
p412
aVbut that's the way he put it.
p413
aVHe saw George Jefferson write a check on "The Jeffersons,"
p414
aVand he never knew that a black man could write a check.
p415
aVAnd he says it just impacted his life so \u2014
p416
aVit changed his life.
p417
aa(lp418
VAnd when I hear things like that \u2014
p419
aVlittle things \u2014
p420
aVbecause I know that there isn't anybody in this audience
p421
aVthat wasn't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody,
p422
aVwhether it's as little as a smile or an unexpected "Hello,"
p423
aVthat's how little this thing was.
p424
aVIt could have been the dresser of the set
p425
aVwho put the checkbook on the thing,
p426
aVand George had nothing to do while he was speaking, so he wrote it,
p427
aVI don't know.
p428
aVBut \u2014
p429
aa(lp430
VEH: So in addition to the long list I shared in the beginning,
p431
aVI should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop.
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VNL: Well ...
p436
aa(lp437
VEH: I want to talk about \u2014
p438
aa(lp439
VNL: Well, then do it.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VEH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,
p444
aVbut you've also built a life of meaning.
p445
aVAnd all of us strive to do both of those things \u2014
p446
aVnot all of us manage to.
p447
aVBut even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those,
p448
aVvery rarely do we figure out how to do them together.
p449
aVYou managed to push culture forward through your art
p450
aVwhile also achieving world-beating commercial success.
p451
aVHow did you do both?
p452
aa(lp453
VNL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished.
p454
aVThis planet is one of a billion,
p455
aVthey tell us,
p456
aVin a universe of which there are billions \u2014
p457
aVbillions of universes,
p458
aVbillions of planets ...
p459
aVwhich we're trying to save
p460
aVand it requires saving.
p461
aVBut ...
p462
aVanything I may have accomplished is \u2014
p463
aVmy sister once asked me what she does about something
p464
aVthat was going on in Newington, Connecticut.
p465
aVAnd I said, "Write your alderman or your mayor or something."
p466
aVShe said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."
p467
aVAnd that was the first time I said what I'm saying,
p468
aVI said, "Claire. With everything you think about what I may have done
p469
aVand everything you've done," \u2014
p470
aVshe never left Newington \u2014
p471
aV"can you get your fingers close enough
p472
aVwhen you consider the size of the planet and so forth,
p473
aVto measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?"
p474
aa(lp475
VSo ...
p476
aVI am convinced we're all responsible
p477
aVfor doing as much as I may have accomplished.
p478
aVAnd I understand what you're saying \u2014
p479
aa(lp480
VEH: It's an articulate deflection \u2014
p481
aa(lp482
VNL: But you have to really buy into the size and scope
p483
aVof the creator's enterprise, here.
p484
aa(lp485
VEH: But here on this planet you have really mattered.
p486
aa(lp487
VNL: I'm a son of a gun.
p488
aa(lp489
V(Laughter)
p490
aa(lp491
VEH: So I have one more question for you.
p492
aVHow old do you feel?
p493
aa(lp494
VNL: I am the peer of whoever I'm talking to.
p495
aa(lp496
VEH: Well, I feel 93.
p497
aa(lp498
V(Applause)
p499
aa(lp500
