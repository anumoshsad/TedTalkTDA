VMy grandfather was a cobbler.
p4
aVBack in the day, he made custom-made shoes.
p5
aVI never got to meet him.
p6
aVHe perished in the Holocaust.
p7
aVBut I did inherit his love for making,
p8
aVexcept that it doesn't exist that much anymore.
p9
aVYou see, while the Industrial Revolution
p10
aVdid a great deal to improve humanity,
p11
aVit eradicated the very skill
p12
aVthat my grandfather loved,
p13
aVand it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut all of that is about to change with 3D printing,
p16
aVand it all started with this,
p17
aVthe very first part
p18
aVthat was ever printed.
p19
aVIt's a little older than TED.
p20
aVIt was printed in 1983
p21
aVby Chuck Hull,
p22
aVwho invented 3D printing.
p23
aVBut the thing that I want to talk to you about today,
p24
aVthe big idea that I want to discuss with you,
p25
aVis not that 3D printing
p26
aVis going to catapult us into the future,
p27
aVbut rather that it's actually going
p28
aVto connect us with our heritage,
p29
aVand it's going to usher in a new era
p30
aVof localized, distributed manufacturing
p31
aVthat is actually based
p32
aVon digital fabrication.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo think about useful things.
p35
aVYou all know your shoe size.
p36
aVHow many of you know the size
p37
aVof the bridge of your nose
p38
aVor the distance between your temples?
p39
aVAnybody?
p40
aVWouldn't it be awesome if you could,
p41
aVfor the first time, get eyewear
p42
aVthat actually fits you perfectly
p43
aVand doesn't require any hinge assembly,
p44
aVso chances are, the hinges are not going to break?
p45
aVBut the implications of 3D printing
p46
aVgo well beyond the tips of our noses.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhen I met Amanda for the first time,
p49
aVshe could already stand up and walk a little bit
p50
aVeven though she was paralyzed from the waist down,
p51
aVbut she complained to me that her suit
p52
aVwas uncomfortable.
p53
aVIt was a beautiful robotic suit
p54
aVmade by Ekso Bionics,
p55
aVbut it wasn't inspired by her body.
p56
aVIt wasn't made to measure.
p57
aVSo she challenged me to make her something
p58
aVthat was a little bit more feminine,
p59
aVa little bit more elegant,
p60
aVand lightweight,
p61
aVand like good tailors,
p62
aVwe thought that we would measure her digitally.
p63
aVAnd we did. We built her an amazing suit.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe incredible part about what I learned
p66
aVfrom Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing
p67
aVand we say to ourselves,
p68
aVit's going to replace traditional methods.
p69
aVAmanda looked at it and she said,
p70
aVit's an opportunity for me
p71
aVto reclaim my symmetry
p72
aVand to embrace my authenticity.
p73
aVAnd you know what? She's not standing still.
p74
aVShe now wants to walk in high heels.
p75
aa(lp76
VIt doesn't stop there.
p77
aV3D printing is changing
p78
aVpersonalized medical devices as we know them,
p79
aVfrom new, beautiful, conformal,
p80
aVventilated scoliosis braces
p81
aVto millions of dental restorations
p82
aVand to beautiful bracings
p83
aVfor amputees,
p84
aVanother opportunity to emotionally reconnect
p85
aVwith your symmetry.
p86
aVAnd as we sit here today,
p87
aVyou can go wireless on your braces
p88
aVwith clear aligners,
p89
aVor your dental restorations.
p90
aVMillions of in-the-ear hearing aids
p91
aVare already 3D printed today.
p92
aVMillions of people are served today
p93
aVfrom these devices.
p94
aVWhat about full knee replacements,
p95
aVfrom your data, made to measure,
p96
aVwhere all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?
p97
aVG.E. is using 3D printing
p98
aVto make the next generation LEAP engine
p99
aVthat will save fuel to the tune
p100
aVof about 15 percent
p101
aVand cost for an airline
p102
aVof about 14 million dollars.
p103
aVGood for G.E., right?
p104
aVAnd their customers and the environment.
p105
aVBut, you know, the even better news
p106
aVis that this technology is no longer reserved
p107
aVfor deep-pocketed corporations.
p108
aVPlanetary Resources, a startup
p109
aVfor space explorations
p110
aVis going to put out its first  space probe later this year.
p111
aVIt was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,
p112
aVit costs a fraction of its cost,
p113
aVand it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,
p114
aVand it's going to be out in space later this year.
p115
aVGoogle is taking on this very audacious project
p116
aVof making the block phone, the Ara.
p117
aVIt's only possible because of the development
p118
aVof high-speed 3D printing that for the first time
p119
aVwill make functional, usable modules
p120
aVthat will go into it.
p121
aVA real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.
p122
aa(lp123
VHow about food?
p124
aVWhat if we could, for the first time,
p125
aVmake incredible delectables
p126
aVlike this beautiful TED Teddy here,
p127
aVthat are edible?
p128
aVWhat if we could completely change the experience,
p129
aVlike you see with that absinthe serving
p130
aVthat is completely 3D printed?
p131
aVAnd what if we could begin to put ingredients
p132
aVand colors and flavors in every taste,
p133
aVwhich means not only delicious foods
p134
aVbut the promise of personalized nutrition
p135
aVaround the corner?
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing.
p138
aVWith 3D printing, complexity is free.
p139
aVThe printer doesn't care
p140
aVif it makes the most rudimentary shape
p141
aVor the most complex shape,
p142
aVand that is completely turning design
p143
aVand manufacturing on its head as we know it.
p144
aVMany people think that 3D printing will be
p145
aVthe end of manufacturing as we know it.
p146
aVI think that it's the opportunity to put
p147
aVtomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters
p148
aVthat will create endless abundance
p149
aVof job opportunities,
p150
aVand with that,
p151
aVeverybody can become an expert maker
p152
aVand an expert manufacturer.
p153
aVThat will take new tools.
p154
aVNot everybody knows how to use CAD,
p155
aVso we're developing haptics,
p156
aVperceptual devices
p157
aVthat will allow you to touch
p158
aVand feel your designs
p159
aVas if you play with digital clay.
p160
aVWhen you do things like that,
p161
aVand we also developed things that take
p162
aVphysical photographs that are instantly printable,
p163
aVit will make it easier to create content,
p164
aVbut with all of the unimagined,
p165
aVwe will also have the unintended,
p166
aVlike democratized counterfeiting
p167
aVand ubiquitous illegal possession.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo many people ask me,
p170
aVwill we have a 3D printer in every home?
p171
aVI think it's the wrong question to ask.
p172
aVThe right question to ask is,
p173
aVhow will 3D printing change my life?
p174
aVOr, in other words, what room in my house
p175
aVwill 3D printing fit in?
p176
aa(lp177
VSo everything that you see here
p178
aVhas been 3D printed,
p179
aVincluding these shoes
p180
aVat the Amsterdam fashion show.
p181
aVNow, these are not my grandfather's shoes.
p182
aVThese are shoes that represent
p183
aVthe continuation of his passion
p184
aVfor hyper-local manufacturing.
p185
aVMy grandfather didn't get to see Nike
p186
aVprinting cleats for the recent Super Bowl,
p187
aVand my father didn't get to see me standing
p188
aVin my hybridized 3D printed shoes.
p189
aVHe passed away three years ago.
p190
aVBut Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,
p191
aVis right here in the house today,
p192
aVand thanks to him,
p193
aVI can say, thanks to his invention, I can say
p194
aVthat I am a cobbler too,
p195
aVand by standing in these shoes
p196
aVI am honoring my past
p197
aVwhile manufacturing the future.
p198
