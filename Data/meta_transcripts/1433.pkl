VWe conventionally divide space
p4
aVinto private and public realms,
p5
aVand we know these legal distinctions very well
p6
aVbecause we've become experts
p7
aVat protecting our private property and private space.
p8
aVBut we're less attuned
p9
aVto the nuances of the public.
p10
aVWhat translates generic public space into qualitative space?
p11
aVI mean, this is something
p12
aVthat our studio has been working on
p13
aVfor the past decade.
p14
aVAnd we're doing this through some case studies.
p15
aa(lp16
VA large chunk of our work
p17
aVhas been put into transforming
p18
aVthis neglected industrial ruin
p19
aVinto a viable post-industrial space
p20
aVthat looks forward and backward
p21
aVat the same time.
p22
aVAnd another huge chunk of our work
p23
aVhas gone into making relevant
p24
aVa site that's grown out of sync with its time.
p25
aVWe've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center
p26
aVfor a public that doesn't usually have $300
p27
aVto spend on an opera ticket.
p28
aVSo we've been eating, drinking,
p29
aVthinking, living public space
p30
aVfor quite a long time.
p31
aVAnd it's taught us really one thing,
p32
aVand that is to truly make good public space,
p33
aVyou have to erase the distinctions
p34
aVbetween architecture, urbanism,
p35
aVlandscape, media design
p36
aVand so on.
p37
aVIt really goes beyond distinction.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
p40
aVand we're working on another transformation,
p41
aVand that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum
p42
aVthat's sited
p43
aVon the most revered public space in America,
p44
aVthe National Mall.
p45
aVThe Mall is a symbol
p46
aVof American democracy.
p47
aVAnd what's fantastic is that this symbol
p48
aVis not a thing, it's not an image,
p49
aVit's not an artifact,
p50
aVactually it's a space,
p51
aVand it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings
p52
aVon either side.
p53
aa(lp54
VIt's a space where citizens can voice their discontent
p55
aVand show their power.
p56
aVIt's a place where pivotal moments in American history
p57
aVhave taken place.
p58
aVAnd they're inscribed in there forever \u2014
p59
aVlike the march on Washington for jobs and freedom
p60
aVand the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.
p61
aVThe Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died
p62
aVin the pandemic of AIDS,
p63
aVthe march for women's reproductive rights,
p64
aVright up until almost the present.
p65
aVThe Mall is the greatest civic stage
p66
aVin this country for dissent.
p67
aVAnd it's synonymous with free speech,
p68
aVeven if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.
p69
aVIt may just be a place for civic commiseration.
p70
aa(lp71
VThere is a huge disconnect, we believe,
p72
aVbetween the communicative and discursive space of the Mall
p73
aVand the museums that line it to either side.
p74
aVAnd that is that those museums are usually passive,
p75
aVthey have passive relationships between the museum
p76
aVas the presenter and the audience,
p77
aVas the receiver of information.
p78
aVAnd so you can see dinosaurs
p79
aVand insects and collections of locomotives
p80
aVand all of that,
p81
aVbut you're really not involved;
p82
aVyou're being talked to.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhen Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn
p85
aVin 2009,
p86
aVhe was determined to take advantage
p87
aVof the fact that this museum was sited
p88
aVat the most unique place:
p89
aVat the seat of power in the U.S.
p90
aVAnd while art and politics
p91
aVare inherently and implicitly together always and all the time,
p92
aVthere could be some very special relationship
p93
aVthat could be forged here in its uniqueness.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe question is, is it possible ultimately
p96
aVfor art to insert itself
p97
aVinto the dialogue of national and world affairs?
p98
aVAnd could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?
p99
aVThere are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
p100
aVThere are over 500 think tanks.
p101
aVThere should be a way
p102
aVof harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy
p103
aVinto, and somehow through, the museum.
p104
aVThere should be some kind of brain trust.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it,
p107
aVand as we evolved the mission,
p108
aVwith Richard and his team \u2014
p109
aVit's really his life blood.
p110
aVBut beyond exhibiting contemporary art,
p111
aVthe Hirshhorn will become a public forum,
p112
aVa place of discourse
p113
aVfor issues around arts,
p114
aVculture, politics and policy.
p115
aVIt would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
p116
aVIt would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
p117
aVIt would have the informality of the town square.
p118
aVAnd for this new initiative,
p119
aVthe Hirshhorn would have to expand
p120
aVor appropriate a site
p121
aVfor a contemporary, deployable structure.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is it. This is the Hirshhorn \u2014
p124
aVso a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut
p125
aVdesigned in the early '70s
p126
aVby Gordon Bunshaft.
p127
aVIt's hulking, it's silent,
p128
aVit's cloistered, it's arrogant,
p129
aVit's a design challenge.
p130
aVArchitects love to hate it.
p131
aVOne redeeming feature
p132
aVis it's lifted up off the ground
p133
aVand it's got this void,
p134
aVand it's got an empty core
p135
aVkind of in the spirit and that facade
p136
aVvery much corporate and federal style.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd around that space,
p139
aVthe ring is actually galleries.
p140
aVVery, very difficult to mount shows in there.
p141
aVWhen the Hirshhorn opened,
p142
aVAda Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic,
p143
aVhad some choice words:
p144
aV"Neo-penitentiary modern."
p145
aV"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall
p146
aVfor a maimed collection."
p147
aa(lp148
VAlmost four decades later,
p149
aVhow will this building expand
p150
aVfor a new progressive program?
p151
aVWhere would it go?
p152
aVIt can't go in the Mall.
p153
aVThere is no space there.
p154
aVIt can't go in the courtyard.
p155
aVIt's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.
p156
aVWell there's always the hole.
p157
aVBut how could it take the space of that hole
p158
aVand not be buried in it invisibly?
p159
aVHow could it become iconic?
p160
aVAnd what language would it take?
p161
aa(lp162
VThe Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions.
p163
aVMost are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,
p164
aVmade of stone or concrete.
p165
aVAnd the question is,
p166
aVif one inhabits that space,
p167
aVwhat is the material of the Mall?
p168
aVIt has to be different from the buildings there.
p169
aVIt has to be something entirely different.
p170
aVIt has to be air.
p171
aVIn our imagination, it has to be light.
p172
aVIt has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
p173
aVAnd it has to be free.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Video)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo this is the big idea.
p178
aVIt's a giant airbag.
p179
aVThe expansion takes the shape of its container
p180
aVand it oozes out wherever it can \u2014
p181
aVthe top and sides.
p182
aVBut more poetically,
p183
aVwe like to think of the structure
p184
aVas inhaling the democratic air of the Mall,
p185
aVbringing it into itself.
p186
aVThe before and the after.
p187
aa(lp188
VIt was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.
p189
aVThat was the lounge.
p190
aVIt's basically one big volume of air
p191
aVthat just oozes out in every direction.
p192
aVThe membrane is translucent.
p193
aVIt's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
p194
aVAnd it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis is the view from the inside.
p197
aVSo you might have been wondering
p198
aVhow in the world
p199
aVdid we get this approved by the federal government.
p200
aVIt had to be approved by actually two agencies.
p201
aVAnd one is there to preserve
p202
aVthe dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
p203
aVI blush whenever I show this.
p204
aVIt is yours to interpret.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut one thing I can say
p207
aVis that it's a combination
p208
aVof iconoclasm
p209
aVand adoration.
p210
aVThere was also some creative interpretation involved.
p211
aVThe Congressional Buildings Act of 1910
p212
aVlimits the height of buildings in D.C.
p213
aVto 130 feet,
p214
aVexcept for spires, towers, domes and minarets.
p215
aVThis pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.
p216
aVAnd the bubble is 153 ft.
p217
aVThat's the Pantheon next to it.
p218
aVIt's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
p219
aVAnd so we argued it
p220
aVon the merits of being a dome.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo there it is,
p223
aVvery stately,
p224
aVamong all the stately buildings in the Mall.
p225
aVAnd while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked,
p226
aVit's very, very historically sensitive.
p227
aVAnd so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
p228
aVWe couldn't leave any traces behind.
p229
aVSo we strained it from the edges,
p230
aVand we held it by cables.
p231
aVIt's a study of some bondage techniques,
p232
aVwhich are actually very important
p233
aVbecause it's hit by wind all the time.
p234
aVThere's one permanent steel ring at the top,
p235
aVbut it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.
p236
aa(lp237
VThere are also some restrictions
p238
aVabout how much it could be lit.
p239
aVIt glows from within, it's translucent.
p240
aVBut it can't be more lit than the Capitol
p241
aVor some of the monuments.
p242
aVSo it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo it comes to the site twice a year.
p245
aVIt's taken off the delivery truck.
p246
aVIt's hoisted.
p247
aVAnd then it's inflated
p248
aVwith this low-pressure air.
p249
aVAnd then it's restrained with the cables.
p250
aVAnd then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is a very strange moment
p253
aVwhere we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall
p254
aVhow much time would it take to install.
p255
aVAnd we said, well the first erection would take one week.
p256
aVAnd they really connected with that idea.
p257
aVAnd then it was really easy all the way through.
p258
aVSo we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say,
p259
aVwith the government and all the authorities.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut some of the toughest hurdles
p262
aVhave been the technical ones.
p263
aVThis is the warp and weft.
p264
aVThis is a point cloud.
p265
aVThere are extreme pressures.
p266
aVThis is a very, very unusual building
p267
aVin that there's no gravity load,
p268
aVbut there's load in every direction.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd I'm just going to zip through these slides.
p271
aVAnd this is the space in action.
p272
aVSo flexible interior for discussions,
p273
aVjust like this, but in the round \u2014
p274
aVluminous and reconfigurable.
p275
aVCould be used for anything,
p276
aVfor performances, films,
p277
aVfor installations.
p278
aVAnd the very first program
p279
aVwill be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy
p280
aVorganized in partnership
p281
aVwith the Council on Foreign Relations.
p282
aa(lp283
VForm and content are together here.
p284
aVThe bubble is an anti-monument.
p285
aVThe ideals of participatory democracy
p286
aVare represented through suppleness
p287
aVrather than rigidity.
p288
aa(lp289
VArt and politics
p290
aVoccupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls,
p291
aVbut inside of the museum's core,
p292
aVblending its air
p293
aVwith the democratic air of the Mall.
p294
aVAnd the bubble will inflate
p295
aVhopefully for the first time
p296
aVat the end of 2013.
p297
