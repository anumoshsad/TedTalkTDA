VI'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine
p4
aVthat I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard,
p5
aVand I'll try to make some connections myself,
p6
aVin case you missed them.
p7
aa(lp8
VBut I want to start with what I call the "official dogma."
p9
aVThe official dogma of what?
p10
aVThe official dogma of all Western industrial societies.
p11
aVAnd the official dogma runs like this:
p12
aVif we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens,
p13
aVthe way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.
p14
aVThe reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good,
p15
aVvaluable, worthwhile, essential to being human.
p16
aVAnd because if people have freedom,
p17
aVthen each of us can act on our own
p18
aVto do the things that will maximize our welfare,
p19
aVand no one has to decide on our behalf.
p20
aVThe way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe more choice people have, the more freedom they have,
p23
aVand the more freedom they have,
p24
aVthe more welfare they have.
p25
aVThis, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply
p26
aVthat it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.
p27
aVAnd it's also deeply embedded in our lives.
p28
aVI'll give you some examples
p29
aVof what modern progress has made possible for us.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is my supermarket.
p32
aVNot such a big one.
p33
aVI want to say just a word about salad dressing.
p34
aV175 salad dressings in my supermarket,
p35
aVif you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils
p36
aVand 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy
p37
aVto make a very large number of your own salad dressings,
p38
aVin the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.
p39
aVSo this is what the supermarket is like.
p40
aVAnd then you go to the consumer electronics store
p41
aVto set up a stereo system \u2014
p42
aVspeakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier \u2014
p43
aVand in this one single consumer electronics store,
p44
aVthere are that many stereo systems.
p45
aVWe can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems
p46
aVout of the components that are on offer in one store.
p47
aa(lp48
VYou've got to admit that's a lot of choice.
p49
aVIn other domains \u2014 the world of communications.
p50
aVThere was a time, when I was a boy,
p51
aVwhen you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,
p52
aVas long as it came from Ma Bell.
p53
aVYou rented your phone. You didn't buy it.
p54
aVOne consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.
p55
aVAnd those days are gone.
p56
aVWe now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,
p57
aVespecially in the world of cell phones.
p58
aVThese are cell phones of the future.
p59
aVMy favorite is the middle one \u2014
p60
aVthe MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet,
p65
aVyou can rest assured that one day soon, you will.
p66
aVAnd what this does
p67
aVis it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.
p68
aVAnd do you know what the answer to this question now is?
p69
aVThe answer is "no."
p70
aVIt is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things,
p73
aVthe same explosion of choice is true.
p74
aVHealth care.
p75
aVIt is no longer the case in the United States
p76
aVthat you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.
p77
aVInstead, you go to the doctor,
p78
aVand the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
p79
aVA has these benefits, and these risks.
p80
aVB has these benefits, and these risks.
p81
aVWhat do you want to do?"
p82
aVAnd you say, "Doc, what should I do?"
p83
aVAnd the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks,
p84
aVand B has these benefits and risks.
p85
aVWhat do you want to do?"
p86
aVAnd you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"
p87
aVAnd the doc says, "But I'm not you."
p88
aVAnd the result is \u2014 we call it "patient autonomy,"
p89
aVwhich makes it sound like a good thing,
p90
aVbut it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility
p91
aVfor decision-making from somebody who knows something \u2014
p92
aVnamely, the doctor \u2014
p93
aVto somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick
p94
aVand thus not in the best shape to be making decisions \u2014
p95
aVnamely, the patient.
p96
aVThere's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
p97
aVto people like you and me,
p98
aVwhich, if you think about it, makes no sense at all,
p99
aVsince we can't buy them.
p100
aVWhy do they market to us if we can't buy them?
p101
aVThe answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning
p102
aVand ask for our prescriptions to be changed.
p103
aa(lp104
VSomething as dramatic as our identity
p105
aVhas now become a matter of choice,
p106
aVas this slide is meant to indicate.
p107
aVWe don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.
p108
aVAnd we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.
p109
aVAnd that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning,
p110
aVyou have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
p111
aVWith respect to marriage and family,
p112
aVthere was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had
p113
aVis that you got married as soon as you could,
p114
aVand then you started having kids as soon as you could.
p115
aVThe only real choice was who,
p116
aVnot when, and not what you did after.
p117
aa(lp118
VNowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.
p119
aVI teach wonderfully intelligent students,
p120
aVand I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.
p121
aVAnd it's not because they're less smart,
p122
aVand it's not because they're less diligent.
p123
aVIt's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,
p124
aV"Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?
p125
aVShould I get married later?
p126
aVShould I have kids first, or a career first?"
p127
aVAll of these are consuming questions.
p128
aVAnd they're going to answer these questions,
p129
aVwhether or not it means not doing all the work I assign
p130
aVand not getting a good grade in my courses.
p131
aVAnd indeed they should.
p132
aVThese are important questions to answer.
p133
aa(lp134
VWork \u2014
p135
aVwe are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,
p136
aVwith the technology that enables us
p137
aVto work every minute of every day from any place on the planet \u2014
p138
aVexcept the Randolph Hotel.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VThere is one corner, by the way,
p145
aVthat I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.
p146
aVI'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
p147
aVSo what this means,
p148
aVthis incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work,
p149
aVis that we have to make a decision,
p150
aVagain and again and again,
p151
aVabout whether we should or shouldn't be working.
p152
aVWe can go to watch our kid play soccer,
p153
aVand we have our cell phone on one hip,
p154
aVand our Blackberry on our other hip,
p155
aVand our laptop, presumably, on our laps.
p156
aVAnd even if they're all shut off,
p157
aVevery minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game,
p158
aVwe are also asking ourselves,
p159
aV"Should I answer this cell phone call?
p160
aVShould I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?"
p161
aVAnd even if the answer to the question is "no,"
p162
aVit's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game
p163
aVvery different than it would've been.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo everywhere we look,
p166
aVbig things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,
p167
aVlife is a matter of choice.
p168
aVAnd the world we used to live in looked like this.
p169
aV[Well, actually, they are written in stone.]
p170
aVThat is to say, there were some choices,
p171
aVbut not everything was a matter of choice.
p172
aVAnd the world we now live in looks like this.
p173
aa(lp174
V[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd the question is, is this good news, or bad news?
p177
aVAnd the answer is, "yes."
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VWe all know what's good about it,
p182
aVso I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
p183
aVAll of this choice has two effects,
p184
aVtwo negative effects on people.
p185
aVOne effect, paradoxically,
p186
aVis that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.
p187
aVWith so many options to choose from,
p188
aVpeople find it very difficult to choose at all.
p189
aVI'll give you one very dramatic example of this:
p190
aVa study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.
p191
aVA colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,
p192
aVthe gigantic mutual-fund company
p193
aVof about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.
p194
aVAnd what she found
p195
aVis that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,
p196
aVrate of participation went down two percent.
p197
aVYou offer 50 funds \u2014 10 percent fewer employees participate
p198
aVthan if you only offer five.
p199
aVWhy?
p200
aVBecause with 50 funds to choose from,
p201
aVit's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,
p202
aVthat you'll just put it off until tomorrow.
p203
aVAnd then tomorrow,
p204
aVand tomorrow, and tomorrow,
p205
aVand of course tomorrow never comes.
p206
aVUnderstand that not only does this mean
p207
aVthat people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire
p208
aVbecause they don't have enough money put away,
p209
aVit also means that making the decision is so hard
p210
aVthat they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
p211
aVBy not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year
p212
aVfrom the employer,
p213
aVwho would happily match their contribution.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
p216
aVAnd I think it makes the world look like this.
p217
aa(lp218
V[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VYou really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?
p223
aVYou don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.
p224
aVSo that's one effect.
p225
aVThe second effect
p226
aVis that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice,
p227
aVwe end up less satisfied with the result of the choice
p228
aVthan we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.
p229
aVAnd there are several reasons for this.
p230
aVOne of them
p231
aVis that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,
p232
aVif you buy one, and it's not perfect \u2014 and what salad dressing is? \u2014
p233
aVit's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice
p234
aVthat would have been better.
p235
aVAnd what happens
p236
aVis this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,
p237
aVand this regret subtracts from the satisfaction
p238
aVyou get out of the decision you made,
p239
aVeven if it was a good decision.
p240
aVThe more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all
p241
aVthat is disappointing about the option that you chose.
p242
aa(lp243
VSecond, what economists call "opportunity costs."
p244
aVDan Gilbert made a big point this morning
p245
aVof talking about how much the way in which we value things
p246
aVdepends on what we compare them to.
p247
aVWell, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,
p248
aVit is easy to imagine the attractive features
p249
aVof alternatives that you reject
p250
aVthat make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.
p251
aVHere's an example.
p252
aa(lp253
V[I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street]
p254
aa(lp255
VSorry if you're not New Yorkers.
p256
aVHere's what you're supposed to be thinking.
p257
aVHere's this couple on the Hamptons.
p258
aVVery expensive real estate.
p259
aVGorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.
p260
aVWhat could be better?
p261
aV"Well, damn it," this guy is thinking,
p262
aV"It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.
p263
aVI could be parking right in front of my building."
p264
aVAnd he spends two weeks nagged by the idea
p265
aVthat he is missing the opportunity,
p266
aVday after day, to have a great parking space.
p267
aVOpportunity costs
p268
aVsubtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose,
p269
aVeven when what we choose is terrific.
p270
aVAnd the more options there are to consider,
p271
aVthe more attractive features of these options
p272
aVare going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.
p273
aa(lp274
VHere's another example.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VNow this cartoon makes a lot of points.
p279
aVIt makes points about living in the moment as well,
p280
aVand probably about doing things slowly.
p281
aVBut one point it makes
p282
aVis that whenever you're choosing one thing,
p283
aVyou're choosing not to do other things
p284
aVthat may have lots of attractive features,
p285
aVand it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.
p286
aa(lp287
VThird: escalation of expectations.
p288
aVThis hit me when I went to replace my jeans.
p289
aVI wear jeans almost all the time.
p290
aVThere was a time when jeans came in one flavor,
p291
aVand you bought them, and they fit like crap,
p292
aVthey were incredibly uncomfortable,
p293
aVif you wore them and washed them enough times,
p294
aVthey started to feel OK.
p295
aVI went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones,
p296
aVand I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size."
p297
aVAnd the shopkeeper said,
p298
aV"Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?
p299
aVYou want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?
p300
aVDo you want them distressed?
p301
aVYou want boot cut, tapered, blah blah." On and on he went.
p302
aVMy jaw dropped.
p303
aVAnd after I recovered, I said,
p304
aV"I want the kind that used to be the only kind."
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VHe had no idea what that was,
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
Vso I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans,
p313
aVand I walked out of the store \u2014 truth! \u2014
p314
aVwith the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.
p315
aVI did better.
p316
aa(lp317
VAll this choice made it possible for me to do better.
p318
aVBut \u2014
p319
aVI felt worse.
p320
aVWhy? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.
p321
aVThe reason \u2014
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VThe reason I felt worse is that,
p326
aVwith all of these options available,
p327
aVmy expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.
p328
aVI had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.
p329
aVWhen they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.
p330
aVAnd what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
p331
aVAnd so I compared what I got to what I expected,
p332
aVand what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.
p333
aVAdding options to people's lives
p334
aVcan't help but increase the expectations people have
p335
aVabout how good those options will be.
p336
aVAnd what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results,
p337
aVeven when they're good results.
p338
aVNobody in the world of marketing knows this.
p339
aa(lp340
V[It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.]
p341
aa(lp342
VBecause if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
p343
aVThe truth is more like this.
p344
aa(lp345
V[Everything was better back when everything was worse]
p346
aa(lp347
VThe reason that everything was better back when everything was worse
p348
aVis that when everything was worse,
p349
aVit was actually possible for people
p350
aVto have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
p351
aVNowadays, the world we live in \u2014 we affluent, industrialized citizens,
p352
aVwith perfection the expectation \u2014
p353
aVthe best you can ever hope for
p354
aVis that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
p355
aVYou will never be pleasantly surprised
p356
aVbecause your expectations, my expectations,
p357
aVhave gone through the roof.
p358
aVThe secret to happiness \u2014 this is what you all came for \u2014
p359
aVthe secret to happiness
p360
aVis low expectations.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
V[You'll do]
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
V(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VI want to say \u2014
p371
aVjust a little autobiographical moment \u2014
p372
aVthat I actually am married to a wife,
p373
aVand she's really quite wonderful.
p374
aVI couldn't have done better.
p375
aVI didn't settle.
p376
aVBut settling isn't always such a bad thing.
p377
aa(lp378
VFinally \u2014
p379
aVOne consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans
p380
aVwhen there is only one kind to buy
p381
aVis that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why,
p382
aVwho's responsible,
p383
aVthe answer is clear: the world is responsible.
p384
aVWhat could you do?
p385
aVWhen there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available,
p386
aVand you buy one that is disappointing,
p387
aVand you ask why, who's responsible?
p388
aVIt is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you."
p389
aVYou could have done better.
p390
aVWith a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,
p391
aVthere is no excuse for failure.
p392
aVAnd so when people make decisions,
p393
aVand even though the results of the decisions are good,
p394
aVthey feel disappointed about them;
p395
aVthey blame themselves.
p396
aa(lp397
VClinical depression has exploded
p398
aVin the industrial world in the last generation.
p399
aVI believe a significant \u2014 not the only, but a significant \u2014 contributor
p400
aVto this explosion of depression, and also suicide,
p401
aVis that people have experiences that are disappointing
p402
aVbecause their standards are so high,
p403
aVand then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,
p404
aVthey think they're at fault.
p405
aVAnd so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively,
p406
aVand we feel worse.
p407
aVSo let me remind you.
p408
aVThis is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,
p409
aVand it's all false.
p410
aVIt is not true.
p411
aVThere's no question that some choice is better than none,
p412
aVbut it doesn't follow from that
p413
aVthat more choice is better than some choice.
p414
aVThere's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.
p415
aVI'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point
p416
aVwhere options improve our welfare.
p417
aa(lp418
VNow, as a policy matter \u2014 I'm almost done \u2014
p419
aVas a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:
p420
aVwhat enables all of this choice
p421
aVin industrial societies is material affluence.
p422
aVThere are lots of places in the world,
p423
aVand we have heard about several of them,
p424
aVwhere their problem is not that they have too much choice.
p425
aVTheir problem is that they have too little.
p426
aVSo the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem
p427
aVof modern, affluent, Western societies.
p428
aVAnd what is so frustrating and infuriating is this:
p429
aVSteve Levitt talked to you yesterday
p430
aVabout how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats
p431
aVdon't help.
p432
aVIt's a waste of money.
p433
aVWhat I'm telling you
p434
aVis that these expensive, complicated choices \u2014
p435
aVit's not simply that they don't help.
p436
aVThey actually hurt.
p437
aVThey actually make us worse off.
p438
aa(lp439
VIf some of what enables people in our societies
p440
aVto make all of the choices we make
p441
aVwere shifted to societies in which people have too few options,
p442
aVnot only would those people's lives be improved,
p443
aVbut ours would be improved also,
p444
aVwhich is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."
p445
aVIncome redistribution will make everyone better off \u2014
p446
aVnot just poor people \u2014
p447
aVbecause of how all this excess choice plagues us.
p448
aVSo to conclude.
p449
aV[You can be anything you want to be \u2014 no limits]
p450
aVYou're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say,
