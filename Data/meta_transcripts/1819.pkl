VSo over the long course of human history,
p4
aVthe infectious disease that's killed more humans
p5
aVthan any other is malaria.
p6
aVIt's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,
p7
aVand it's probably our oldest scourge.
p8
aVWe may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.
p9
aVAnd to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.
p10
aVWe've got 300 million cases a year
p11
aVand over half a million deaths.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow this really makes no sense.
p14
aVWe've known how to cure malaria
p15
aVsince the 1600s.
p16
aVThat's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru
p17
aVdiscovered the bark of the cinchona tree,
p18
aVand inside that bark was quinine,
p19
aVstill an effective cure for malaria to this day.
p20
aVSo we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.
p21
aVWe've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.
p22
aVThat's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross
p23
aVdiscovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,
p24
aVnot bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.
p25
aVSo malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,
p26
aVand yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people
p27
aVare going to die from the bite of a mosquito.
p28
aVWhy is that?
p29
aa(lp30
VThis is a question that's
p31
aVpersonally intrigued me for a long time.
p32
aVI grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants
p33
aVvisiting my cousins in India every summer,
p34
aVand because I had no immunity to the local malarias,
p35
aVI was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night
p36
aVwhile my cousins, they were allowed to sleep
p37
aVout on the terrace and have
p38
aVthis nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.
p39
aVAnd I really hated the mosquitos for that.
p40
aVBut at the same time, I come from a Jain family,
p41
aVand Jainism is a religion that espouses
p42
aVa very extreme form of nonviolence.
p43
aVSo Jains are not supposed to eat meat.
p44
aVWe're not supposed to walk on grass,
p45
aVbecause you could, you know,
p46
aVinadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.
p47
aVWe're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.
p48
aVSo the fearsome power of this little insect
p49
aVwas apparent to me from a very young age,
p50
aVand it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist
p51
aVtrying to understand, why has malaria
p52
aVbeen such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?
p53
aVAnd I think there's three main reasons why.
p54
aVThose three reasons add up to the fourth reason,
p55
aVwhich is probably the biggest reason of all.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe first reason is certainly scientific.
p58
aVThis little parasite that causes malaria,
p59
aVit's probably one of the most complex
p60
aVand wily pathogens known to humankind.
p61
aVIt lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito
p62
aVand half its life inside the warm-blooded human.
p63
aVThese two environments are totally different,
p64
aVbut not only that, they're both utterly hostile.
p65
aVSo the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,
p66
aVand so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.
p67
aVThis little creature survives under siege like that,
p68
aVbut not only does it survive, it has thrived.
p69
aVIt has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.
p70
aVIt's a shape-shifter, for one thing.
p71
aVJust as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,
p72
aVthe malaria parasite transforms itself like that
p73
aVseven times in its life cycle.
p74
aVAnd each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,
p75
aVthey have totally different physiology.
p76
aVSo say you came up with some great drug
p77
aVthat worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.
p78
aVIt might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.
p79
aVIt can hide in our bodies, undetected,
p80
aVunbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,
p81
aVfor months, for years, in some cases even decades.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,
p84
aVbut so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.
p85
aVOnly about 12 species of mosquitos
p86
aVcarry most of the world's malaria,
p87
aVand we know quite a bit about the kinds of
p88
aVwatery habitats that they specialize in.
p89
aVSo you might think, then, well, why don't we just
p90
aVavoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?
p91
aVWe could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live
p92
aVand we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.
p93
aVBut say you live in the tropics
p94
aVand you walk outside your hut one day
p95
aVand you leave some footprints in the soft dirt
p96
aVaround your home.
p97
aVOr say your cow does, or say your pig does,
p98
aVand then, say, it rains,
p99
aVand that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.
p100
aVThat's it. You've created the perfect
p101
aVmalarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.
p102
aVSo it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.
p103
aVWe kind of create places that they love to live
p104
aVjust by living our own lives.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo there's a huge scientific challenge,
p107
aVbut there's a huge economic challenge too.
p108
aVMalaria occurs in some of the poorest
p109
aVand most remote places on Earth,
p110
aVand there's a reason for that.
p111
aVIf you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.
p112
aVIf you're poor, you're more likely to live
p113
aVin rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.
p114
aVThese are places where mosquitos breed.
p115
aVYou're less likely to have door screens or window screens.
p116
aVYou're less likely to have electricity
p117
aVand all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,
p118
aVso you're outside more.
p119
aVYou're getting bitten by mosquitos more.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo poverty causes malaria,
p122
aVbut what we also know now is that malaria itself
p123
aVcauses poverty.
p124
aVFor one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,
p125
aVso exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields
p126
aVcollecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.
p127
aVBut it also predisposes people to death
p128
aVfrom all other causes.
p129
aVSo this has happened historically.
p130
aVWe've been able to take malaria out of a society.
p131
aVEverything else stays the same,
p132
aVso we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,
p133
aVall the things that make people sick.
p134
aVBut just if you take malaria out,
p135
aVdeaths from everything else go down.
p136
aVAnd the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified
p137
aVwhat this means for a society.
p138
aVWhat it means is, if you have malaria in your society,
p139
aVyour economic growth is depressed
p140
aVby 1.3 percent every year,
p141
aVyear after year after year, just this one disease alone.
p142
aVSo this poses a huge economic challenge,
p143
aVbecause say you do come up with your great drug
p144
aVor your great vaccine \u2014 how do you deliver it
p145
aVin a place where there's no roads,
p146
aVthere's no infrastructure,
p147
aVthere's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,
p148
aVthere's no clinics, there's no clinicians
p149
aVto deliver these things where they're needed?
p150
aVSo there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,
p153
aVthere's also a cultural challenge,
p154
aVand this is probably the part about malaria
p155
aVthat people don't like to talk about.
p156
aVAnd it's the paradox that the people
p157
aVwho have the most malaria in the world
p158
aVtend to care about it the least.
p159
aVThis has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.
p160
aVThey ask people in malarious parts of the world,
p161
aV"What do you think about malaria?"
p162
aVAnd they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."
p163
aVThey say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life."
p164
aVAnd that was certainly my personal experience.
p165
aVWhen I told my relatives in India
p166
aVthat I was writing a book about malaria,
p167
aVthey kind of looked at me like
p168
aVI told them I was writing a book about warts or something.
p169
aVLike, why would you write about something so boring,
p170
aVso ordinary? You know?
p171
aVAnd it's simple risk perception, really.
p172
aVA child in Malawi, for example,
p173
aVshe might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,
p174
aVbut if she survives,
p175
aVshe'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,
p176
aVbut she's much less likely to die of it.
p177
aVAnd so in her lived experience,
p178
aVmalaria is something that comes and goes.
p179
aVAnd that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.
p180
aVMost of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.
p181
aVIt's just, there's so much malaria
p182
aVthat this tiny fraction of cases that end in death
p183
aVadd up to this big, huge number.
p184
aVSo I think people in malarious parts of the world
p185
aVmust think of malaria the way
p186
aVthose of us who live in the temperate world
p187
aVthink of cold and flu. Right?
p188
aVCold and flu have a huge burden on our societies
p189
aVand on our own lives,
p190
aVbut we don't really even take
p191
aVthe most rudimentary precautions against it because
p192
aVwe consider it normal to get cold and flu
p193
aVduring cold and flu season.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,
p196
aVbecause if people think it's normal to have malaria,
p197
aVthen how do you get them to run to the doctor
p198
aVto get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,
p199
aVto get it filled, to take the drugs,
p200
aVto put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?
p201
aVThis is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo take all that together.
p204
aVWe've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,
p205
aVit's economically challenging to deal with,
p206
aVand it's one for which the people who stand
p207
aVto benefit the most care about it the least.
p208
aVAnd that adds up to the biggest problem of all,
p209
aVwhich, of course, is the political problem.
p210
aVHow do you get a political leader to do anything
p211
aVabout a problem like this?
p212
aVAnd the answer is, historically, you don't.
p213
aVMost malarious societies throughout history
p214
aVhave simply lived with the disease.
p215
aVSo the main attacks on malaria have come
p216
aVfrom outside of malarious societies,
p217
aVfrom people who aren't constrained
p218
aVby these rather paralyzing politics.
p219
aVBut this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe first concerted attack against malaria
p222
aVstarted in the 1950s.
p223
aVIt was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.
p224
aVAnd this effort well understood the economic challenge.
p225
aVThey knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,
p226
aVand they focused on DDT.
p227
aVThey understood the cultural challenge.
p228
aVIn fact, their rather patronizing view was that
p229
aVpeople at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.
p230
aVEverything should be done to them and for them.
p231
aVBut they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.
p232
aVThey had so much faith in their tools
p233
aVthat they stopped doing malaria research.
p234
aVAnd so when those tools started to fail,
p235
aVand public opinion started to turn against those tools,
p236
aVthey had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.
p237
aVThe whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,
p238
aVbut now it was even worse than before
p239
aVbecause it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places
p240
aVin the most difficult-to-control forms.
p241
aVOne WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign
p242
aV"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."
p243
aa(lp244
VThe latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.
p245
aVIt's similarly directed and financed primarily
p246
aVfrom outside of malarious societies.
p247
aVNow this effort well understands the scientific challenge.
p248
aVThey are doing tons of malaria research.
p249
aVAnd they understand the economic challenge too.
p250
aVThey're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.
p251
aVBut now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.
p252
aVThe centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.
p253
aVIt's treated with insecticides.
p254
aVThis thing has been distributed across the malarious world
p255
aVby the millions.
p256
aVAnd when you think about the bed net,
p257
aVit's sort of a surgical intervention.
p258
aVYou know, it doesn't really have any value
p259
aVto a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.
p260
aVAnd yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.
p261
aVThey have to sleep under them every night.
p262
aVThat's the only way they are effective.
p263
aVAnd they have to do that
p264
aVeven if the net blocks the breeze,
p265
aVeven if they might have to get up in the middle of the night
p266
aVand relieve themselves,
p267
aVeven if they might have to move all their furnishings
p268
aVto put this thing up,
p269
aVeven if, you know, they might live in a round hut
p270
aVin which it's difficult to string up a square net.
p271
aVNow that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.
p272
aVI mean, these are minor inconveniences.
p273
aVBut that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.
p274
aVSo for them, the calculus must be quite different.
p275
aa(lp276
VImagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans
p277
aVcame up to those of us in the temperate world and said,
p278
aV"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.
p279
aVWe've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,
p280
aVwe're going to give it to you for free.
p281
aVIt's called a face mask,
p282
aVand all you need to do is
p283
aVwear it every day during cold and flu season
p284
aVwhen you go to school and when you go to work."
p285
aVWould we do that?
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd I wonder if that's how people
p288
aVin the malarious world thought of those nets
p289
aVwhen they first received them?
p290
aVIndeed, we know from studies
p291
aVthat only 20 percent of the bed nets
p292
aVthat were first distributed were actually used.
p293
aVAnd even that's probably an overestimate,
p294
aVbecause the same people who distributed the nets
p295
aVwent back and asked the recipients,
p296
aV"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"
p297
aVWhich is like your Aunt Jane asking you,
p298
aV"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"
p299
aVSo it's probably an overestimate.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut that's not an insurmountable problem.
p302
aVWe can do more education,
p303
aVwe can try to convince these people to use the nets.
p304
aVAnd that's what happening now.
p305
aVWe're throwing a lot more time and money
p306
aVinto workshops and trainings and musicals and plays
p307
aVand school meetings,
p308
aVall these things to convince people
p309
aVto use the nets we gave you.
p310
aVAnd that might work.
p311
aVBut it takes time. It takes money.
p312
aVIt takes resources. It takes infrastructure.
p313
aVIt takes all the things that that cheap,
p314
aVeasy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,
p317
aVbut it's equally tricky when we try to attack it
p318
aVfrom outside of those societies.
p319
aVWe end up imposing our own priorities
p320
aVon the people of the malarious world.
p321
aVThat's exactly what we did in the 1950s,
p322
aVand that effort backfired.
p323
aVI would argue today,
p324
aVwhen we are distributing tools that we've designed
p325
aVand that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,
p326
aVwe run the risk of making the same mistake again.
p327
aa(lp328
VThat's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,
p329
aVbecause I think it is,
p330
aVbut what if we attacked this disease
p331
aVaccording to the priorities of the people who lived with it?
p332
aVTake the example of England and the United States.
p333
aVWe had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,
p334
aVand we got rid of it completely,
p335
aVnot because we attacked malaria. We didn't.
p336
aVWe attacked bad roads and bad houses
p337
aVand bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.
p338
aVWe attacked the malarious way of life,
p339
aVand by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.
p340
aVNow attacking the malarious way of life,
p341
aVthis is something \u2014 these are things people care about today.
p342
aVAnd attacking the malarious way of life,
p343
aVit's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,
p344
aVbut I think it's the only lasting way forward.
p345
