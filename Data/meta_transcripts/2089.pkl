VGood afternoon.
p4
aVMy name is Uldus.
p5
aVI am a photo-based artist from Russia.
p6
aVI started my way around six years ago
p7
aVwith ironic self-portraits
p8
aVto lay open so many stereotypes
p9
aVabout nationalities, genders,
p10
aVand social issues \u2014
p11
aV["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"] ["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] (Laughter) \u2014
p12
aVusing photography as my tool to send a message. ["Marry me, I need a visa."]
p13
aa(lp14
VToday, I am still performing in front of the camera
p15
aVand trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.
p16
aVI focus on balancing meaningful message,
p17
aVaesthetic, beauty, composition,  some irony, and artifacts.
p18
aa(lp19
VToday, I'm going to tell you about my project,
p20
aVwhich is named Desperate Romantics.
p21
aVThey're my artifacts, or paintings
p22
aVfrom pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England
p23
aVmid-19th century.
p24
aVI took the painting
p25
aVand gifted new, contemporary meaning
p26
aVtalking about issues which are surrounding me
p27
aVin Russia,
p28
aVcapturing people who are non-models
p29
aVbut have an interesting story.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis boy is a professional dancer,
p32
aVonly 12 years old,
p33
aVbut at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes
p34
aVand is wearing the mask of brutality,
p35
aVtrying to be united with the rest of his classmates
p36
aVlike a storm trooper has no personality.
p37
aVBut this boy has goals and dreams
p38
aVbut hides it to be socially accepted,
p39
aVbecause being different isn't easy,
p40
aVespecially in Russia.
p41
aa(lp42
VNext portrait interpretation is metaphoric.
p43
aVAnd this is Nikita,
p44
aVa security guard from one of the bars
p45
aVin St. Petersburg.
p46
aVHe likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"
p47
aVquoting Hulk from the movie,
p48
aVbut I've never seen him angry.
p49
aVHe hides his sensitivities and romantic side,
p50
aVbecause in Russia, among guys,
p51
aVthat's not cool to be romantic,
p52
aVbut it's cool to be surrounded with women
p53
aVand look like an aggressive hulk.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSometimes, in my project,
p57
aVI would take the painting
p58
aVand give it new meaning
p59
aVand new temptation about it.
p60
aVSometimes, I would compare facial features
p61
aVand playing with words:
p62
aVirony, Iron Man, ironing man.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VThrough the artifacts,
p66
aVI bring social issues
p67
aVwhich surround me in Russia into the conversation.
p68
aVInteresting fact about marriage in Russia,
p69
aVthat most of the 18, 19-year-old girls
p70
aVare already ready, and dream to get married.
p71
aVWe're taught from childhood,
p72
aVsuccessful marriage means successful life,
p73
aVso most of the girls kind of fight
p74
aVto get a good husband.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd what about me?
p77
aVI'm 27 years old.
p78
aVFor Russian society, I'm an old maid
p79
aVand hopeless to ever get married.
p80
aVThat's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,
p81
aVin the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.
p82
aVBut remember, irony is the key,
p83
aVand this is actually to motivate girls
p84
aVto fight for goals, for dreams,
p85
aVand change stereotypes.
p86
aVBe brave. Be ironic \u2014 it helps.
