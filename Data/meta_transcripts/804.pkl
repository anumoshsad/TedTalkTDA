VI want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history
p4
aVin 18 minutes.
p5
aVThat's 300 million years per minute.
p6
aVLet's start with the first photograph NASA obtained
p7
aVof planet Mars.
p8
aVThis is fly-by, Mariner IV.
p9
aVIt was taken in 1965.
p10
aVWhen this picture appeared,
p11
aVthat well-known scientific journal,
p12
aVThe New York Times, wrote in its editorial,
p13
aV"Mars is uninteresting.
p14
aVIt's a dead world. NASA should not spend
p15
aVany time or effort studying Mars anymore."
p16
aVFortunately, our leaders in Washington
p17
aVat NASA headquarters knew better
p18
aVand we began a very extensive study
p19
aVof the red planet.
p20
aa(lp21
VOne of the key questions in all of science,
p22
aV"Is there life outside of Earth?"
p23
aVI believe that Mars is the most likely target
p24
aVfor life outside the Earth.
p25
aVI'm going to show you in a few minutes
p26
aVsome amazing measurements that suggest
p27
aVthere may be life on Mars.
p28
aVBut let me start with a Viking photograph.
p29
aVThis is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.
p30
aVViking was developed and managed at the
p31
aVNASA Langley Research Center.
p32
aVWe sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.
p33
aVWe had four spacecraft, two around Mars,
p34
aVtwo on the surface \u2014
p35
aVan amazing accomplishment.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis is the first photograph taken from
p38
aVthe surface of any planet.
p39
aVThis is a Viking Lander photograph
p40
aVof the surface of Mars.
p41
aVAnd yes, the red planet is red.
p42
aVMars is half the size of the Earth,
p43
aVbut because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,
p44
aVthe land area on Mars
p45
aVis comparable to the land area on Earth.
p46
aVSo, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.
p47
aVWe have obtained topographic measurements
p48
aVof the surface of Mars. We understand
p49
aVthe elevation differences.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe know a lot about Mars.
p52
aVMars has the largest volcano in the solar system,
p53
aVOlympus Mons.
p54
aVMars has the Grand Canyon
p55
aVof the solar system, Valles Marineris.
p56
aVVery, very interesting planet.
p57
aVMars has the largest
p58
aVimpact crater in the solar system,
p59
aVHellas Basin.
p60
aVThis is 2,000 miles across.
p61
aVIf you happened to be on Mars
p62
aVwhen this impactor hit,
p63
aVit was a really bad day on Mars.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVThis is Olympus Mons.
p66
aVThis is bigger than the state of Arizona.
p67
aa(lp68
VVolcanoes are important, because volcanoes
p69
aVproduce atmospheres and they produce oceans.
p70
aVWe're looking at Valles Marineris,
p71
aVthe largest canyon in the solar system,
p72
aVsuperimposed on a map of the United States,
p73
aV3,000 miles across.
p74
aVOne of the most intriguing features about Mars,
p75
aVthe National Academy of Science says
p76
aVone of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,
p77
aVis why certain areas of Mars
p78
aVare so highly magnetized.
p79
aVWe call this crustal magnetism.
p80
aVThere are regions on Mars, where, for some reason \u2014
p81
aVwe don't understand why at this point \u2014
p82
aVthe surface is very, very highly magnetized.
p83
aa(lp84
VIs there water on Mars?
p85
aVThe answer is no, there is no liquid water
p86
aVon the surface of Mars today.
p87
aVBut there is intriguing evidence
p88
aVthat suggests that the early history of Mars
p89
aVthere may have been rivers
p90
aVand fast flowing water.
p91
aVToday Mars is very very dry.
p92
aVWe believe there's some water in the polar caps,
p93
aVthere are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.
p94
aVHere are some recent images.
p95
aVThis is from Spirit and Opportunity.
p96
aVThese images that show at one time,
p97
aVthere was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.
p98
aVWhy is water important? Water is important
p99
aVbecause if you want life you have to have water.
p100
aVWater is the key ingredient
p101
aVin the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.
p102
aa(lp103
VHere is some picture of Antarctica
p104
aVand a picture of Olympus Mons,
p105
aVvery similar features, glaciers.
p106
aVSo, this is frozen water.
p107
aVThis is ice water on Mars.
p108
aVThis is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.
p109
aVIt has not been seen publicly.
p110
aVThis is European space agency
p111
aVMars Express, image of a crater on Mars
p112
aVand in the middle of the crater
p113
aVwe have liquid water, we have ice.
p114
aVVery intriguing photograph.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe now believe that in the early history of Mars,
p117
aVwhich is 4.6 billion years ago,
p118
aV4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.
p119
aVMars had rivers, Mars had lakes,
p120
aVbut more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.
p121
aVWe believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,
p122
aVand this area in blue,
p123
aVwhich shows a depression of about four miles,
p124
aVwas the ancient ocean area
p125
aVon the surface of Mars.
p126
aVWhere did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?
p127
aVWell, we have an idea.
p128
aVThis is a measurement we obtained a few years ago
p129
aVfrom a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.
p130
aVSub-surface water on Mars,
p131
aVfrozen in the form of ice.
p132
aVAnd this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,
p133
aVit means 16 percent by weight.
p134
aVSixteen percent, by weight, of the interior
p135
aVcontains frozen water, or ice.
p136
aVSo, there is a lot of water below the surface.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe most intriguing and puzzling measurement,
p139
aVin my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,
p140
aVwas released earlier this year
p141
aVin the magazine Science.
p142
aVAnd what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,
p143
aVCH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.
p144
aVAnd you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.
p145
aVWhy is methane important?
p146
aVBecause on Earth, almost all \u2014
p147
aV99.9 percent \u2014 of the methane
p148
aVis produced by living systems,
p149
aVnot little green men, but microscopic life
p150
aVbelow the surface or at the surface.
p151
aVWe now have evidence
p152
aVthat methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,
p153
aVa gas that, on Earth,
p154
aVis biogenic in origin,
p155
aVproduced by living systems.
p156
aVThese are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd this is the terrain it appears over,
p159
aVand we know from geological studies
p160
aVthat these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.
p161
aVIn fact, the Earth and Mars
p162
aVare both 4.6 billion years old.
p163
aVThe oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.
p164
aVThe reason there is a billion-year gap
p165
aVin our geological understanding
p166
aVis because of plate tectonics,
p167
aVThe crust of the Earth has been recycled.
p168
aVWe have no geological record prior
p169
aVfor the first billion years.
p170
aVThat record exists on Mars.
p171
aVAnd this terrain that we're looking at
p172
aVdates back to 4.6 billion years
p173
aVwhen Earth and Mars were formed.
p174
aVIt was a Tuesday.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VThis is a map that shows
p178
aVwhere we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.
p179
aVHere is Viking I, Viking II.
p180
aVThis is Opportunity. This is Spirit.
p181
aVThis is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,
p182
aVwe just put two years ago.
p183
aVNotice all of our rovers and all of our landers
p184
aVhave gone to the northern hemisphere.
p185
aVThat's because the northern hemisphere
p186
aVis the region of the ancient
p187
aVocean basin.
p188
aVThere aren't many craters.
p189
aVAnd that's because the water protected the basin
p190
aVfrom being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.
p191
aVBut look in the southern hemisphere.
p192
aVIn the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,
p193
aVthere are volcanic craters.
p194
aVHere's Hellas Basin,
p195
aVa very very different place, geologically.
p196
aVLook where the methane is, the methane is in a very
p197
aVrough terrain area.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhat is the best way to unravel
p200
aVthe mysteries on Mars that exist?
p201
aVWe asked this question 10 years ago.
p202
aVWe invited 10 of the top Mars scientists
p203
aVto the Langley Research Center for two days.
p204
aVWe addressed on the board
p205
aVthe major questions that have not been answered.
p206
aVAnd we spent two days deciding
p207
aVhow to best answer this question.
p208
aVAnd the result of our meeting
p209
aVwas a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.
p210
aVIt's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
p211
aVThere's a model of ARES here.
p212
aVThis is a 20-percent scale model.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.
p215
aVIf any place in the world
p216
aVcan build an airplane to fly on Mars,
p217
aVit's the Langley Research Center,
p218
aVfor almost 100 years
p219
aVa leading center of aeronautics in the world.
p220
aVWe fly about a mile above the surface.
p221
aVWe cover hundreds of miles,
p222
aVand we fly about 450 miles an hour.
p223
aVWe can do things that rovers can't do
p224
aVand landers can't do:
p225
aVWe can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;
p226
aVwe fly over valleys;
p227
aVwe can fly over surface magnetism,
p228
aVthe polar caps, subsurface water;
p229
aVand we can search for life on Mars.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut, of equal importance,
p232
aVas we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,
p233
aVwe transmit that journey,
p234
aVthe first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,
p235
aVwe transmit those images back to Earth.
p236
aVAnd our goal is to inspire the American public
p237
aVwho is paying for this mission through tax dollars.
p238
aVBut more important we will
p239
aVinspire the next generation of scientists,
p240
aVtechnologists, engineers and mathematicians.
p241
aVAnd that's a critical area of national security
p242
aVand economic vitality, to make sure
p243
aVwe produce the next generation
p244
aVof scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is what ARES looks like
p247
aVas it flies over Mars.
p248
aVWe preprogram it.
p249
aVWe will fly where the methane is.
p250
aVWe will have instruments aboard the plane
p251
aVthat will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.
p252
aVWe will look for methane
p253
aVas well as other gasses
p254
aVproduced by living systems.
p255
aVWe will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,
p256
aVbecause we can measure the gradient where it comes from,
p257
aVand there, we can direct the next mission
p258
aVto land right in that area.
p259
aa(lp260
VHow do we transport an airplane to Mars?
p261
aVIn two words, very carefully.
p262
aVThe problem is we don't fly it to Mars,
p263
aVwe put it in a spacecraft
p264
aVand we send it to Mars.
p265
aVThe problem is the spacecraft's
p266
aVlargest diameter is nine feet;
p267
aVARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
p268
aVHow do we get it to Mars?
p269
aVWe fold it,
p270
aVand we transport it in a spacecraft.
p271
aVAnd we have it in something called an aeroshell.
p272
aVThis is how we do it.
p273
aVAnd we have a little video that describes the sequence.
p274
aa(lp275
VVideo: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.
p276
aVMain engine start, and liftoff.
p277
aa(lp278
VJoel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
p279
aVThis is the spacecraft taking nine months
p280
aVto get to Mars.
p281
aVIt enters the atmosphere of Mars.
p282
aVA lot of heating,
p283
aVfrictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.
p284
aVA parachute opens up to slow it down.
p285
aVThe thermal tiles fall off.
p286
aVThe airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.
p287
aVIt unfolds.
p288
aVThe rocket engine begins.
p289
aa(lp290
VWe believe that in a one-hour flight
p291
aVwe can rewrite the textbook on Mars
p292
aVby making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,
p293
aVlooking for gases of biogenic origin,
p294
aVlooking for gases of volcanic origin,
p295
aVstudying the surface, studying the magnetism
p296
aVon the surface, which we don't understand,
p297
aVas well as about a dozen other areas.
p298
aa(lp299
VPractice makes perfect.
p300
aVHow do we know we can do it?
p301
aVBecause we have tested ARES model,
p302
aVseveral models in a half a dozen wind tunnels
p303
aVat the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,
p304
aVunder Mars conditions.
p305
aVAnd, of equal importance
p306
aVis, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,
p307
aVat 100,000 feet,
p308
aVwhich is comparable to the density and pressure
p309
aVof the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.
p310
aVNow, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,
p311
aVyou fly 37,000 feet.
p312
aVWe do our tests at 100,000 feet.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd I want to show you one of our tests.
p315
aVThis is a half-scale model.
p316
aVThis is a high-altitude helium balloon.
p317
aVThis is over Tilamook, Oregon.
p318
aVWe put the folded airplane on the balloon \u2014
p319
aVit took about three hours to get up there \u2014
p320
aVand then we released it on command
p321
aVat 103,000 feet,
p322
aVand we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.
p323
aVAnd we've done
p324
aVhigh-altitude and low-altitude tests,
p325
aVjust to perfect this technique.
p326
aa(lp327
VWe're ready to go.
p328
aVI have a scale model here.
p329
aVBut we have a full-scale model
p330
aVin storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.
p331
aVWe're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVto cover the costs.
p334
aVI'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk
p335
aVfor this mission.
p336
aVThere's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.
p337
aVThis is the ARES team;
p338
aVwe have about 150 scientists, engineers;
p339
aVwhere we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
p340
aVGoddard Space Flight Center,
p341
aVAmes Research Center and half a dozen major universities
p342
aVand corporations in developing this.
p343
aa(lp344
VIt's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.
p345
aVAnd let me conclude by saying
p346
aVnot too far from here,
p347
aVright down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,
p348
aVa little more than 100 years ago
p349
aVhistory was made
p350
aVwhen we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.
p351
aVWe are on the verge right now
p352
aVto make the first flight of an airplane
p353
aVoutside the Earth's atmosphere.
p354
aVWe are prepared to fly this on Mars,
p355
aVrewrite the textbook about Mars.
p356
aVIf you're interested in more information,
p357
aVwe have a website that describes this exciting
p358
aVand intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.
p359
aVThank you very much.
