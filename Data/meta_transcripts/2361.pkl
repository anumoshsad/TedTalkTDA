VA few years ago, I broke into my own house.
p4
aVI had just driven home,
p5
aVit was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,
p6
aVI had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,
p7
aVand the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees \u2014
p8
aVand don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
p9
aVminus 40 is where the two scales meet \u2014
p10
aVit was very cold.
p11
aVAnd as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,
p12
aVI found I didn't have my keys.
p13
aVIn fact, I could see them through the window,
p14
aVlying on the dining room table where I had left them.
p15
aVSo I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,
p16
aVand they were locked tight.
p17
aVI thought about calling a locksmith \u2014 at least I had my cellphone,
p18
aVbut at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,
p19
aVand it was cold.
p20
aVI couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night
p21
aVbecause I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,
p22
aVand I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, desperate and freezing cold,
p25
aVI found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,
p26
aVcleared out the shards of glass,
p27
aVI crawled through,
p28
aVI found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,
p29
aVfiguring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,
p30
aVI could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.
p31
aVThis was going to be expensive,
p32
aVbut probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
p33
aVso I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, I'm a neuroscientist by training
p36
aVand I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
p37
aVIt releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,
p38
aVit modulates adrenaline levels
p39
aVand it clouds your thinking.
p40
aVSo the next morning,
p41
aVwhen I woke up on too little sleep,
p42
aVworrying about the hole in the window,
p43
aVand a mental note that I had to call my contractor,
p44
aVand the freezing temperatures,
p45
aVand the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
p46
aVand, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,
p47
aVmy thinking was cloudy,
p48
aVbut I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,
p53
aVthat I realized I didn't have my passport.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,
p58
aVgot my passport, raced back to the airport,
p59
aVI made it just in time,
p60
aVbut they had given away my seat to someone else,
p61
aVso I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,
p62
aVin a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.
p63
aVWell, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd I started wondering, are there things that I can do,
p68
aVsystems that I can put into place,
p69
aVthat will prevent bad things from happening?
p70
aVOr at least if bad things happen,
p71
aVwill minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.
p72
aVSo I started thinking about that,
p73
aVbut my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.
p74
aVI was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
p75
aVand I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,
p76
aVand, you know, forgotten my passport,
p77
aVand Danny shared with me
p78
aVthat he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VIt's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,
p83
aVwho had written about it a few years before,
p84
aValso called the pre-mortem.
p85
aVNow, you all know what the postmortem is.
p86
aVWhenever there's a disaster,
p87
aVa team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
p88
aVWell, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
p89
aVyou look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,
p90
aVand then you try to figure out what you can do
p91
aVto prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo what I want to talk to you about today
p94
aVare some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.
p95
aVSome of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
p96
aVI'll start with the obvious ones.
p97
aa(lp98
VAround the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.
p99
aVNow, this sounds like common sense, and it is,
p100
aVbut there's a lot of science to back this up,
p101
aVbased on the way our spatial memory works.
p102
aVThere's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,
p103
aVthat evolved over tens of thousands of years,
p104
aVto keep track of the locations of important things \u2014
p105
aVwhere the well is, where fish can be found,
p106
aVthat stand of fruit trees,
p107
aVwhere the friendly and enemy tribes live.
p108
aVThe hippocampus is the part of the brain
p109
aVthat in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.
p110
aVIt's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
p111
aVAnd if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment
p112
aVwhere they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
p113
aVand they could still find their nuts.
p114
aVThey weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,
p115
aVthis exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
p116
aVBut it's really good for things that don't move around much,
p117
aVnot so good for things that move around.
p118
aVSo this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.
p119
aVSo in the home, designate a spot for your keys \u2014
p120
aVa hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.
p121
aVFor your passport, a particular drawer.
p122
aVFor your reading glasses, a particular table.
p123
aVIf you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,
p124
aVyour things will always be there when you look for them.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhat about travel?
p127
aVTake a cell phone picture of your credit cards,
p128
aVyour driver's license, your passport,
p129
aVmail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
p130
aVIf these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow these are some rather obvious things.
p133
aVRemember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
p134
aVCortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
p135
aVSo part of the practice of the pre-mortem
p136
aVis to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,
p137
aVand you should put systems in place.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd there's perhaps no more stressful a situation
p140
aVthan when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
p141
aVAnd at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,
p142
aVwhere we have to make a very important decision
p143
aVabout the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,
p144
aVto help them with a decision.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd so I want to talk about that.
p147
aVAnd I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
p148
aVBut this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,
p149
aVand indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making \u2014
p150
aVany kind of decision you have to make
p151
aVthat would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,
p154
aV"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
p155
aVNow, you all know that high cholesterol
p156
aVis associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
p157
aVheart attack, stroke.
p158
aVAnd so you're thinking
p159
aVhaving high cholesterol isn't the best thing,
p160
aVand so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug
p161
aVthat will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."
p162
aVAnd you've probably heard of statins,
p163
aVyou know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs
p164
aVin the world today,
p165
aVyou probably even know people who take them.
p166
aVAnd so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."
p167
aa(lp168
VBut there's a question you should ask at this point,
p169
aVa statistic you should ask for
p170
aVthat most doctors don't like talking about,
p171
aVand pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
p172
aVIt's for the number needed to treat.
p173
aVNow, what is this, the NNT?
p174
aVIt's the number of people that need to take a drug
p175
aVor undergo a surgery or any medical procedure
p176
aVbefore one person is helped.
p177
aVAnd you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?
p178
aVThe number should be one.
p179
aVMy doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me
p180
aVif it's not going to help.
p181
aVBut actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
p182
aVAnd it's not the doctor's fault,
p183
aVif it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.
p184
aVWe haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.
p185
aVBut GlaxoSmithKline estimates
p186
aVthat 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
p187
aVSo the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,
p188
aVwhat do you suppose it is?
p189
aVHow many people have to take it before one person is helped?
p190
aV300.
p191
aVThis is according to research
p192
aVby research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
p193
aVindependently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
p194
aVI ran through the numbers myself.
p195
aV300 people have to take the drug for a year
p196
aVbefore one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow you're probably thinking,
p199
aV"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.
p200
aVWhy not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."
p201
aVBut you should ask at this point for another statistic,
p202
aVand that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?
p203
aVSo for this particular drug,
p204
aVthe side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
p205
aVAnd they include terrible things \u2014
p206
aVdebilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress \u2014
p207
aVbut now you're thinking, "Five percent,
p208
aVnot very likely it's going to happen to me,
p209
aVI'll still take the drug."
p210
aVBut wait a minute.
p211
aVRemember under stress you're not thinking clearly.
p212
aVSo think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,
p213
aVso you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
p214
aV300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,
p215
aVfive percent of those 300 have side effects,
p216
aVthat's 15 people.
p217
aVYou're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug
p218
aVthan you are to be helped by the drug.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.
p221
aVI'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.
p222
aVMedical ethics requires it,
p223
aVit's part of the principle of informed consent.
p224
aVYou have the right to have access to this kind of information
p225
aVto begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow you might be thinking
p228
aVI've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,
p229
aVbut in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.
p230
aVFor the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,
p231
aVremoval of the prostate for cancer,
p232
aVthe number needed to treat is 49.
p233
aVThat's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.
p234
aVAnd the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
p235
aVThey include impotence, erectile dysfunction,
p236
aVurinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
p237
aVfecal incontinence.
p238
aVAnd if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,
p239
aVthey'll only last for a year or two.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time
p242
aVto the questions that you might be able to ask
p243
aVthat will push the conversation forward.
p244
aVYou don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.
p245
aVAnd you also want to think about things like quality of life.
p246
aVBecause you have a choice oftentimes,
p247
aVdo you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,
p248
aVor a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?
p249
aVThese are things to talk about and think about now,
p250
aVwith your family and your loved ones.
p251
aVYou might change your mind in the heat of the moment,
p252
aVbut at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
p253
aa(lp254
VRemember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,
p255
aVand one of the things that happens at that moment
p256
aVis a whole bunch on systems shut down.
p257
aVThere's an evolutionary reason for this.
p258
aVFace-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,
p259
aVor your libido, or your immune system,
p260
aVbecause if you're body is expending metabolism on those things
p261
aVand you don't react quickly,
p262
aVyou might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.
p263
aVUnfortunately,
p264
aVone of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress
p265
aVis rational, logical thinking,
p266
aVas Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.
p267
aVSo we need to train ourselves to think ahead
p268
aVto these kinds of situations.
p269
aa(lp270
VI think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
p271
aVWe all are going to fail now and then.
p272
aVThe idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,
p273
aVto put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,
p274
aVor to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.
p275
aa(lp276
VGetting back to that snowy night in Montreal,
p277
aVwhen I got back from my trip,
p278
aVI had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,
p279
aVwith a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.
p280
aVAnd I have to admit,
p281
aVI still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,
p282
aVand piles of emails that I haven't gone through.
p283
aVSo I'm not completely organized,
p284
aVbut I see organization as a gradual process,
p285
aVand I'm getting there.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you very much.
