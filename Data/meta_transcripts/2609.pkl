VSome people are obsessed by French wines.
p4
aVOthers love playing golf
p5
aVor devouring literature.
p6
aVOne of my greatest pleasures in life is, I have to admit,
p7
aVa bit special.
p8
aVI cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching cities from the sky,
p9
aVfrom an airplane window.
p10
aa(lp11
VSome cities are calmly industrious,
p12
aVlike Dusseldorf
p13
aVor Louisville.
p14
aVOthers project an energy that they can hardly contain,
p15
aVlike New York
p16
aVor Hong Kong.
p17
aVAnd then you have Paris
p18
aVor Istanbul,
p19
aVand their patina full of history.
p20
aa(lp21
VI see cities as living beings.
p22
aVAnd when I discover them from far above,
p23
aVI like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space.
p24
aVEspecially at night,
p25
aVwhen commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden:
p26
aVthe city's vascular system performing its vital function
p27
aVright before your eyes.
p28
aVBut when I'm sitting in my car
p29
aVafter an hour and a half of commute every day,
p30
aVthat reality looks very different.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VNothing \u2014
p35
aVnot public radio,
p36
aVno podcast \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aVNot even mindfulness meditation
p40
aVmakes this time worth living.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VIsn't it absurd
p45
aVthat we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour
p46
aVand we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages?
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VIn the US alone,
p51
aVwe spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014.
p52
aVWith that amount of time,
p53
aVancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VWe do that in one year.
p58
aVA monumental waste of time, energy and human potential.
p59
aa(lp60
VFor decades,
p61
aVour remedy for congestion was simple:
p62
aVbuild new roads or enlarge existing ones.
p63
aVAnd it worked.
p64
aVIt worked admirably for Paris,
p65
aVwhen the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings
p66
aVto create 85 miles
p67
aVof transportation-friendly boulevards.
p68
aVAnd it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities.
p69
aVBut in more established urban centers,
p70
aVsignificant network expansions are almost impossible:
p71
aVhabitat is just too dense,
p72
aVreal estate, too expensive
p73
aVand public finances, too fragile.
p74
aVOur city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick,
p75
aVand we should pay attention.
p76
aa(lp77
VOur current way of thinking is not working.
p78
aVFor our transportation to flow,
p79
aVwe need a new source of inspiration.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo after 16 years working in transportation,
p82
aVmy "aha moment" happened when speaking with a biotech customer.
p83
aVShe was telling me how her treatment
p84
aVwas leveraging specific properties of our vascular system.
p85
aV"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system \u2014
p86
aVall the veins and arteries in our body
p87
aVmaking miracles of logistics every day."
p88
aVThis is the moment I realized
p89
aVthat biology has been in the transportation business
p90
aVfor billions of years.
p91
aVIt has been testing countless solutions
p92
aVto move nutrients, gases and proteins.
p93
aVIt really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us?
p96
aVI wanted to know:
p97
aVWhy is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives,
p98
aVwhen our big cities get clogged on a daily basis?
p99
aVAnd the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks.
p100
aVI don't know if you realize,
p101
aVbut each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies \u2014
p102
aV60,000 miles.
p103
aVThat's two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference,
p104
aVinside you.
p105
aVWhat it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us,
p106
aVnot just under the surface of our skin.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut if you look at our cities,
p109
aVyes, we have some underground subway systems
p110
aVand some tunnels and bridges,
p111
aVand also some helicopters in the sky.
p112
aVBut the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground,
p113
aVon the surface.
p114
aVSo in other words,
p115
aVwhile our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us,
p116
aVour urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional.
p117
aVAnd so what we need is to embrace that verticality.
p118
aVIf our surface grid is saturated,
p119
aVwell, let's elevate our traffic.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis Chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams \u2014
p122
aVthat was an eye-opener on new ways to think about space and movement
p123
aVinside our cities.
p124
aVAnd we can go higher,
p125
aVand suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid.
p126
aVTel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing
p127
aVthese futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods.
p128
aVAnd we can keep climbing, and fly.
p129
aVThe fact that a company like Airbus
p130
aVis now seriously working on flying urban taxis
p131
aVis telling us something.
p132
aVFlying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu
p133
aVto attractive business-case territory.
p134
aVAnd that's an exciting moment.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo building this 3-D transportation network
p137
aVis one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams.
p138
aVBut it's not the only one.
p139
aVWe have to question
p140
aVother fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use.
p141
aVJust imagine a very familiar scene:
p142
aVYou've been driving for 42 minutes.
p143
aVThe two kids behind you are getting restless.
p144
aVAnd you're late.
p145
aVDo you see that slow car in front of you?
p146
aVAlways comes when you're late, right?
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VThat driver is looking for parking.
p151
aVThere is no parking spot available in the area,
p152
aVbut how would he know?
p153
aVIt is estimated that up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated
p154
aVby drivers looking for parking.
p155
aVDo you see the 100 cars around you?
p156
aVEighty-five of them only have one passenger.
p157
aVThose 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus.
p158
aVSo the question is:
p159
aVWhy are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most?
p160
aVWhy are we doing this to ourselves?
p161
aa(lp162
VBiology would never do this.
p163
aVSpace inside our arteries is fully utilized.
p164
aVAt every heartbeat,
p165
aVa higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells
p166
aVinto massive trains of oxygen
p167
aVthat quickly flow throughout our body.
p168
aVAnd the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either.
p169
aVIn healthy conditions,
p170
aVmore than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized.
p171
aVCan you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities
p172
aVwere 95 percent full,
p173
aVall the additional space you would have to walk, to bike
p174
aVand to enjoy our cities?
p175
aa(lp176
VThe reason blood is so incredibly efficient
p177
aVis that our red blood cells are not dedicated
p178
aVto specific organs or tissues;
p179
aVotherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins.
p180
aVNo, they're shared.
p181
aVThey're shared by all the cells of our body.
p182
aVAnd because our network is so extensive,
p183
aVeach one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen
p184
aVprecisely when it needs them.
p185
aa(lp186
VBlood is both a collective and individual form of transportation.
p187
aVBut for our cities,
p188
aVwe've been stuck.
p189
aVWe've been stuck in an endless debate
p190
aVbetween creating a car-centric society or extensive mass-transit systems.
p191
aVI think we should transcend this.
p192
aVI think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars
p193
aVand the efficiencies of trains and buses.
p194
aVJust imagine.
p195
aVYou're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train,
p196
aValong with 1,200 passengers.
p197
aVThe problem with urban trains
p198
aVis that sometimes you have to stop five, ten, fifteen times
p199
aVbefore your final destination.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat if in this train you didn't have to stop?
p202
aVIn this train,
p203
aVwagons can detach dynamically while you're moving
p204
aVand become express, driverless buses
p205
aVthat move on a secondary road network.
p206
aVAnd so without a single stop,
p207
aVnor a lengthy transfer,
p208
aVyou are now sitting in a bus that is headed toward your suburb.
p209
aVAnd when you get close,
p210
aVthe section you're sitting in detaches
p211
aVand self-drives you right to your doorstep.
p212
aVIt is collective and individual at the same time.
p213
aVThis could be one of the shared, modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow ...
p216
aVas if walking in a city buzzing with drones,
p217
aVflying taxis, modular buses and suspended magnetic pods
p218
aVwas not exotic enough,
p219
aVI think there is another force in action
p220
aVthat will make urban traffic mesmerizing.
p221
aVIf you think about it,
p222
aVthe current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way
p223
aVinto a traffic grid made by and for humans.
p224
aVThey're trying to learn traffic rules, which is relatively simple,
p225
aVand coping with human unpredictability,
p226
aVwhich is more challenging.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut what would happen when whole cities become driverless?
p229
aVWould we need traffic lights?
p230
aVWould we need lanes?
p231
aVHow about speed limits?
p232
aVRed blood cells are not flowing in lanes.
p233
aVThey never stop at red lights.
p234
aVIn the first driverless cities,
p235
aVyou would have no red lights and no lanes.
p236
aVAnd when all the cars are driverless and connected,
p237
aVeverything is predictable and reaction time, minimum.
p238
aVThey can drive much faster
p239
aVand can take any rational initiative that can speed them up
p240
aVor the cars around them.
p241
aVSo instead of rigid traffic rules,
p242
aVflow will be regulated
p243
aVby a mesh of dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms.
p244
aVThe result: a strange traffic
p245
aVthat mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns
p246
aVand the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VTraffic will be functionally exuberant.
p251
aVIt will be liquid like our blood.
p252
aVAnd by a strange paradox,
p253
aVthe more robotized our traffic grid will be,
p254
aVthe more organic and alive its movement will feel.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo yes,
p257
aVbiology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today.
p258
aVBut this process has taken billions of years,
p259
aVand went through all sorts of iterations and mutations.
p260
aVWe can't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system.
p261
aVWe now have the dreams,
p262
aVthe concepts
p263
aVand the technology
p264
aVto create 3-D transportation networks,
p265
aVinvent new vehicles
p266
aVand change the flow in our cities.
p267
aa(lp268
VLet's do it.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
