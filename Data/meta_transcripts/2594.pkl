VWhen Dorothy was a little girl,
p4
aVshe was fascinated by her goldfish.
p5
aVHer father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails
p6
aVto propel themselves through the water.
p7
aVWithout hesitation, little Dorothy responded,
p8
aV"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads."
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VIn her mind, it was a fact as true as any other.
p13
aVFish swim backwards by wagging their heads.
p14
aVShe believed it.
p15
aa(lp16
VOur lives are full of fish swimming backwards.
p17
aVWe make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic.
p18
aVWe harbor bias.
p19
aVWe know that we are right, and they are wrong.
p20
aVWe fear the worst.
p21
aVWe strive for unattainable perfection.
p22
aVWe tell ourselves what we can and cannot do.
p23
aVIn our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads
p24
aVand we don't even notice them.
p25
aa(lp26
VI'm going to tell you five facts about myself.
p27
aVOne fact is not true.
p28
aVOne: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics.
p29
aVTwo: I currently run a construction company in Orlando.
p30
aVThree: I starred on a television sitcom.
p31
aVFour: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease.
p32
aVFive: I served as a law clerk to two US Supreme Court justices.
p33
aVWhich fact is not true?
p34
aVActually, they're all true.
p35
aVYeah. They're all true.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Applause)
p38
aa(lp39
VAt this point, most people really only care about the television show.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VI know this from experience.
p44
aVOK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class."
p45
aVAnd I played Weasel Wyzell,
p46
aVwho was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show,
p47
aVwhich made it a very major acting challenge
p48
aVfor me as a 13-year-old boy.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, did you struggle with number four, my blindness?
p53
aVWhy is that?
p54
aVWe make assumptions about so-called disabilities.
p55
aVAs a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions
p56
aVabout my abilities every day.
p57
aVMy point today is not about my blindness, however.
p58
aVIt's about my vision.
p59
aVGoing blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open.
p60
aVIt taught me to spot those backwards-swimming fish
p61
aVthat our minds create.
p62
aVGoing blind cast them into focus.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat does it feel like to see?
p65
aVIt's immediate and passive.
p66
aVYou open your eyes and there's the world.
p67
aVSeeing is believing. Sight is truth.
p68
aVRight?
p69
aVWell, that's what I thought.
p70
aa(lp71
VThen, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated.
p72
aVMy sight became an increasingly bizarre
p73
aVcarnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions.
p74
aVThe salesperson I was relieved to spot in a store
p75
aVwas really a mannequin.
p76
aVReaching down to wash my hands,
p77
aVI suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink,
p78
aVwhen my fingers felt its true shape.
p79
aVA friend described the photograph in my hand,
p80
aVand only then I could see the image depicted.
p81
aVObjects appeared, morphed and disappeared in my reality.
p82
aVIt was difficult and exhausting to see.
p83
aVI pieced together fragmented, transitory images,
p84
aVconsciously analyzed the clues,
p85
aVsearched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope,
p86
aVuntil I saw nothing at all.
p87
aa(lp88
VI learned that what we see
p89
aVis not universal truth.
p90
aVIt is not objective reality.
p91
aVWhat we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality
p92
aVthat is masterfully constructed by our brain.
p93
aa(lp94
VLet me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience.
p95
aVYour visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain.
p96
aVThat's compared to approximately eight percent for touch
p97
aVand two to three percent for hearing.
p98
aVEvery second, your eyes can send your visual cortex
p99
aVas many as two billion pieces of information.
p100
aVThe rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.
p101
aVSo sight is one third of your brain by volume
p102
aVand can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources.
p103
aVIt's no surprise then
p104
aVthat the illusion of sight is so compelling.
p105
aVBut make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion.
p106
aa(lp107
VHere's where it gets interesting.
p108
aVTo create the experience of sight,
p109
aVyour brain references your conceptual understanding of the world,
p110
aVother knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention.
p111
aVAll of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight.
p112
aVThese linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously.
p113
aVSo for example,
p114
aVwhat you see impacts how you feel,
p115
aVand the way you feel can literally change what you see.
p116
aVNumerous studies demonstrate this.
p117
aVIf you are asked to estimate
p118
aVthe walking speed of a man in a video, for example,
p119
aVyour answer will be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles.
p120
aVA hill appears steeper if you've just exercised,
p121
aVand a landmark appears farther away
p122
aVif you're wearing a heavy backpack.
p123
aVWe have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.
p124
aVWhat you see is a complex mental construction of your own making,
p125
aVbut you experience it passively
p126
aVas a direct representation of the world around you.
p127
aVYou create your own reality, and you believe it.
p128
aVI believed mine until it broke apart.
p129
aVThe deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion.
p130
aa(lp131
VYou see, sight is just one way
p132
aVwe shape our reality.
p133
aVWe create our own realities in many other ways.
p134
aVLet's take fear as just one example.
p135
aVYour fears distort your reality.
p136
aVUnder the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain.
p137
aVFear fills the void at all costs,
p138
aVpassing off what you dread for what you know,
p139
aVoffering up the worst in place of the ambiguous,
p140
aVsubstituting assumption for reason.
p141
aVPsychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VRight?
p146
aVFear replaces the unknown with the awful.
p147
aVNow, fear is self-realizing.
p148
aVWhen you face the greatest need
p149
aVto look outside yourself and think critically,
p150
aVfear beats a retreat deep inside your mind,
p151
aVshrinking and distorting your view,
p152
aVdrowning your capacity for critical thought
p153
aVwith a flood of disruptive emotions.
p154
aVWhen you face a compelling opportunity to take action,
p155
aVfear lulls you into inaction,
p156
aVenticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhen I was diagnosed with my blinding disease,
p159
aVI knew blindness would ruin my life.
p160
aVBlindness was a death sentence for my independence.
p161
aVIt was the end of achievement for me.
p162
aVBlindness meant I would live an unremarkable life,
p163
aVsmall and sad,
p164
aVand likely alone.
p165
aVI knew it.
p166
aVThis was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed it.
p167
aVIt was a lie, but it was my reality,
p168
aVjust like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind.
p169
aVIf I had not confronted the reality of my fear,
p170
aVI would have lived it.
p171
aVI am certain of that.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo how do you live your life eyes wide open?
p174
aVIt is a learned discipline.
p175
aVIt can be taught. It can be practiced.
p176
aVI will summarize very briefly.
p177
aa(lp178
VHold yourself accountable
p179
aVfor every moment, every thought,
p180
aVevery detail.
p181
aVSee beyond your fears.
p182
aVRecognize your assumptions.
p183
aVHarness your internal strength.
p184
aVSilence your internal critic.
p185
aVCorrect your misconceptions about luck and about success.
p186
aVAccept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference.
p187
aVOpen your hearts
p188
aVto your bountiful blessings.
p189
aa(lp190
VYour fears, your critics,
p191
aVyour heroes, your villains \u2014
p192
aVthey are your excuses,
p193
aVrationalizations, shortcuts,
p194
aVjustifications, your surrender.
p195
aVThey are fictions you perceive as reality.
p196
aVChoose to see through them.
p197
aVChoose to let them go.
p198
aVYou are the creator of your reality.
p199
aVWith that empowerment comes complete responsibility.
p200
aa(lp201
VI chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined.
p202
aVI chose to build there a blessed life.
p203
aVFar from alone,
p204
aVI share my beautiful life with Dorothy,
p205
aVmy beautiful wife,
p206
aVwith our triplets, whom we call the Tripskys,
p207
aVand with the latest addition to the family,
p208
aVsweet baby Clementine.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat do you fear?
p211
aVWhat lies do you tell yourself?
p212
aVHow do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions?
p213
aVWhat reality are you creating for yourself?
p214
aa(lp215
VIn your career and personal life, in your relationships,
p216
aVand in your heart and soul,
p217
aVyour backwards-swimming fish do you great harm.
p218
aVThey exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential,
p219
aVand they engender insecurity and distrust
p220
aVwhere you seek fulfillment and connection.
p221
aVI urge you to search them out.
p222
aa(lp223
VHelen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind
p224
aVis having sight but no vision.
p225
aVFor me, going blind was a profound blessing,
p226
aVbecause blindness gave me vision.
p227
aVI hope you can see what I see.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)

VBruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question.
p234
aVThis is an audience of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators.
p235
aVYou are a CEO of a company down in Florida,
p236
aVand many are probably wondering,
p237
aVhow is it to be a blind CEO?
p238
aVWhat kind of specific challenges do you have, and how do you overcome them?
p239
aa(lp240
VIsaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became a blessing.
p241
aVI don't get visual feedback from people.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VBG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.
p246
aVSo, for example, in my leadership team meetings,
p247
aVI don't see facial expressions or gestures.
p248
aVI've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback.
p249
aVI basically force people to tell me what they think.
p250
aVAnd in this respect,
p251
aVit's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company,
p252
aVbecause we communicate at a far deeper level,
p253
aVwe avoid ambiguities,
p254
aVand most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters.
p255
aa(lp256
VBG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED. IL: Thank you, Bruno.
