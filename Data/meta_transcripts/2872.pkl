VBack home, my friends call me nicknames,
p4
aVsuch as "The Giant Clam Girl,"
p5
aV"Clam Queen,"
p6
aVor, "The Mother of Clams."
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is because every time I see them,
p11
aVI talk nonstop about giant clams all day,
p12
aVevery day.
p13
aVGiant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals,
p14
aVthe largest of its kind.
p15
aVJust look at this shell.
p16
aVThe biggest recorded individual was four-and-a-half-feet long
p17
aVand weighed about 550 pounds.
p18
aVThat is almost as heavy as three baby elephants.
p19
aa(lp20
VSouth Pacific legends once described giant clams as man-eaters
p21
aVthat would lie in wait on the seabed to trap unsuspecting divers.
p22
aVA story goes that a diver had lost his legs
p23
aVwhile trying to retrieve a pearl from a giant clam.
p24
aVI thought, "Really?"
p25
aVSo out of curiosity,
p26
aVI did an experiment using myself as bait.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VI carefully placed my hand into the clam's mouth and waited.
p31
aVHmm ...
p32
aVI still have my hand.
p33
aVIt seems that these gentle giants would rather retreat
p34
aVand protect their fleshy bodies
p35
aVthan feed on me.
p36
aVSo much for those killer clam myths!
p37
aa(lp38
VUnfortunately, the reality is,
p39
aVwe are the giant clams' biggest threat.
p40
aVConsidered a delicacy throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,
p41
aVgiant clams have been traditionally fished as seafood.
p42
aVFishermen are particularly interested in their adductor muscles,
p43
aVwhich are organs that hold the two shells together like a hinge.
p44
aVJust for their muscles,
p45
aVgiant clams were almost hunted to extinction
p46
aVbetween the 1960s and 1980s.
p47
aVClamshells are also popular in the ornamental trade
p48
aVas jewelry and for display.
p49
aVIn the South China Sea,
p50
aVfishermen went out of their way to collect fossilized clamshells
p51
aVby digging through large areas of coral reefs.
p52
aVThese were later carved and sold as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.
p53
aVGiant clams, dead or alive, are not safe from us.
p54
aVIt's a "clamity!"
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VWith the spotlight on more charismatic marine animals
p61
aVsuch as the whales and coral reefs,
p62
aVit is easy to forget that other marine life needs our help, too.
p63
aVMy fascination with giant clams got me started on conservation research
p64
aVto fill in the knowledge gaps on their ecology and behavior.
p65
aVOne of the discoveries that we made was that giant clams could walk
p66
aVacross the seafloor.
p67
aVYes, you heard me right:
p68
aVthey can walk.
p69
aa(lp70
VTo find out,
p71
aVwe placed numerous baby clams on a grid.
p72
aVNow watch what happens over 24 hours.
p73
aVWe think that walking is important for getting away from predators
p74
aVand finding mates for breeding.
p75
aVWhile it can hard to imagine any movement in these enormous animals,
p76
aVgiant clams up to 400 pounds can still walk,
p77
aVthey just move slower.
p78
aa(lp79
VDuring my PhD, I discovered more secrets about the giant clams.
p80
aVBut there was something missing in my work.
p81
aVI found myself asking,
p82
aV"Why should people care about conserving giant clams?" \u2014
p83
aVother than myself, of course.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VIt turns out that giant clams have a giant impact on coral reefs.
p88
aVThese multitasking clams are reef builders,
p89
aVfood factories,
p90
aVshelters for shrimps and crabs
p91
aVand water filters,
p92
aVall rolled into one.
p93
aVIn a nutshell,
p94
aVgiant clams play a major contributing role
p95
aVas residents of their own reef home,
p96
aVand just having them around keeps the reef healthy.
p97
aVAnd because they can live up to 100 years old,
p98
aVgiant clams make vital indicators of coral reef health.
p99
aVSo when giant clams start to disappear from coral reefs,
p100
aVtheir absence can serve as an alarm bell
p101
aVfor scientists to start paying attention,
p102
aVsimilar to the canary in a coal mine.
p103
aVBut giant clams are endangered.
p104
aVThe largest clam in the world is facing the threat of extinction,
p105
aVwith more than 50 percent of the wild population severely depleted.
p106
aVAnd the ecological benefits of having giant clams on coral reefs
p107
aVare likely to continue only if populations are healthy,
p108
aVmaking their conservation paramount.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I stand here today to give a voice to the giant clams,
p111
aVbecause I care a whole lot for these amazing animals,
p112
aVand they deserve to be cared for.
p113
aVIt is time for the giant clams to step out of their shells,
p114
aVand show the world that they, too, can be the heroes of the oceans.
p115
aa(lp116
VThank you very much.
