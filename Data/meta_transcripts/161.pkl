VNow, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
p4
aVYou know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.
p5
aVHow about this word?
p6
aVHere, I'll show it to you.
p7
aVLexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
p8
aVNotice \u2014 we're very specific \u2014 that word "compile."
p9
aVThe dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,
p10
aVout of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
p11
aVIt's little discrete \u2014
p12
aVthat's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E \u2014 bits.
p13
aVAnd those bits are words.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow one of the perks of being a lexicographer \u2014
p16
aVbesides getting to come to TED \u2014 is that you get to say really fun words,
p17
aVlike lexicographical.
p18
aVLexicographical has this great pattern:
p19
aVit's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,
p20
aVI've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)
p21
aVBut "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
p22
aVRight? It's a fun word to say,
p23
aVand I get to say it a lot.
p24
aVNow, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer
p25
aVis that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
p26
aVRight? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
p27
aVBut what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
p28
aVJust to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
p29
aVBut people think that my job is to let the good words
p30
aVmake that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,
p31
aVand keep the bad words out.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
p34
aVFor one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
p35
aVAnd for another, deciding what words are good
p36
aVand what words are bad is actually not very easy.
p37
aVAnd it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,
p38
aVyou kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
p39
aVSo if I had to think of some kind of occupation
p40
aVas a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
p41
aVI want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English
p42
aVand see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
p43
aVBut why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
p44
aVWell, I blame the Queen.
p45
aVWhy do I blame the Queen?
p46
aVWell, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
p47
aVBut secondly, I blame the Queen because
p48
aVdictionaries have really not changed.
p49
aa(lp50
VOur idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
p51
aVThe only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries
p52
aVis our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened
p53
aVin American dictionaries since 1965.
p54
aVSo, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
p55
aVJames Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
p56
aVI do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
p57
aVSo he's really responsible for a lot of
p58
aVwhat we consider modern in dictionaries today.
p59
aVWhen a guy who looks like that, in that hat,
p60
aVis the face of modernity, you have a problem.
p61
aVAnd so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
p62
aVThere'd be virtually no learning curve.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
p65
aVComputers! What about computers?
p66
aVThe thing about computers is, I love computers.
p67
aVI mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
p68
aVI would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
p69
aVBut computers don't do much else other than
p70
aVspeed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
p71
aVThey don't change the end result.
p72
aVBecause what a dictionary is,
p73
aVis it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
p74
aVIt's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
p75
aVYou know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
p76
aVThe design has not changed.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
p79
aVOnline dictionaries must be different.
p80
aVThis is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
p81
aVThis is my favorite word, by the way.
p82
aVErinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
p83
aVVery useful word. So, look at that.
p84
aVOnline dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
p85
aVThis is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
p86
aVRight? Those little buttons,
p87
aVI had them all expanded except for the date chart.
p88
aVSo there's not very much going on here.
p89
aVThere's not a lot of clickiness.
p90
aVAnd in fact, online dictionaries replicate
p91
aValmost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
p92
aVAnd when you improve searchability,
p93
aVyou actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
p94
aVSerendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,
p95
aVbecause finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 now, when you think about this,
p98
aVwhat we have here is a ham butt problem.
p99
aVDoes everyone know the ham butt problem?
p100
aVWoman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
p101
aVShe goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,
p102
aVand she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,
p103
aV"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
p104
aVShe thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
p105
aVSo she calls up mom, and she says,
p106
aV"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
p107
aVShe says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
p108
aVSo they call grandma, and grandma says,
p109
aV"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
p112
aVWe have a pan that's too small!
p113
aVYou know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
p114
aVThe bad words \u2014 see, when people think about a place
p115
aVand they don't find a place on the map,
p116
aVthey think, "This map sucks!"
p117
aVWhen they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,
p118
aVthey're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
p119
aVWhen they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,
p120
aV"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
p121
aVWhy are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
p122
aVSo, you can't get a smaller ham.
p123
aVThe English language is as big as it is.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo, if you have a ham butt problem,
p126
aVand you're thinking about the ham butt problem,
p127
aVthe conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:
p128
aVpaper is the enemy of words.
p129
aVHow can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
p130
aVSome of my best friends are books.
p131
aVBut the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
p132
aVNow they're going to think "Oh, boy.
p133
aVPeople are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
p134
aVNo. There will still be paper dictionaries.
p135
aVWhen we had cars \u2014 when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,
p136
aVwe didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
p137
aVYou know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,
p138
aVbut it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
p139
aVThe book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape
p140
aVdictionaries come in. And it's not going to be
p141
aVthe prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,
p144
aVartificial constraints lead to
p145
aVarbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
p146
aVWhat if biologists could only study animals
p147
aVthat made people go, "Aww." Right?
p148
aVWhat if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,
p149
aVand only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
p150
aVWe'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,
p151
aVand not very much about much else.
p152
aVAnd I think this is a problem.
p153
aVI think we should study all the words,
p154
aVbecause when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions
p155
aVfrom very humble parts.
p156
aVLexicography is really more about material science.
p157
aVWe are studying the tolerances of the materials
p158
aVthat you use to build the structure of your expression:
p159
aVyour speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,
p160
aV"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
p161
aVThey think, "OK, if we think words are the tools
p162
aVthat we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,
p163
aVhow can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
p164
aVHow can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
p165
aVThey're just the right tools for the job.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
p168
aVYou know, anybody who's read a children's book
p169
aVknows that love makes things real.
p170
aVIf you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
p171
aVBeing in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
p172
aVIt doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
p173
aVIf you love a word, it becomes real.
p174
aVSo if we're not worrying about directing traffic,
p175
aVif we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less
p176
aVabout control and more about description,
p177
aVthen we can think of the English language
p178
aVas being this beautiful mobile.
p179
aVAnd any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,
p180
aVis touched, any time you touch a word,
p181
aVyou use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,
p182
aVyou verb it, you make the mobile move.
p183
aVYou didn't break it. It's just in a new position,
p184
aVand that new position can be just as beautiful.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, if you're no longer a traffic cop \u2014
p187
aVthe problem with being a traffic cop is
p188
aVthere can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,
p189
aVor the cars get confused. Right?
p190
aVBut if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,
p191
aVbut maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
p192
aVYou can ask for help!
p193
aVIf you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
p194
aVLibrary of Congress: 17 million books,
p195
aVof which half are in English.
p196
aVIf only one out of every 10 of those books
p197
aVhad a word that's not in the dictionary in it,
p198
aVthat would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd I find an un-dictionaried word \u2014
p201
aVa word like "un-dictionaried," for example \u2014
p202
aVin almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
p203
aVNewspaper archive goes back to 1759,
p204
aV58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100
p205
aVof those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,
p206
aVit would be an entire other OED.
p207
aVThat's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
p208
aVAnd I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs \u2014
p209
aVand I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week
p210
aVthan I do Newsweek or Time.
p211
aVThere's a lot going on there.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd I'm not even talking about polysemy,
p214
aVwhich is the greedy habit some words have of taking
p215
aVmore than one meaning for themselves.
p216
aVSo if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,
p217
aVa set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,
p218
aVand there's one numbered definition in the OED.
p219
aVThe OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
p220
aVTiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
p221
aVOne of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
p222
aVDo you know what that says to me?
p223
aVThat says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)
p224
aVThat's a lexicographical cop out,
p225
aVto say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
p226
aa(lp227
VSo, we have all these words, and we really need help!
p228
aVAnd the thing is, we could ask for help \u2014
p229
aVasking for help's not that hard.
p230
aVI mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
p231
aVSee, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,
p232
aVand this is more of a visual explanation.
p233
aVIf we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,
p234
aVthese bright spots are what we know about,
p235
aVand the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
p236
aVIf that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
p237
aVAnd we don't even know the shape of the language.
p238
aVIf this was the dictionary \u2014 if this was the map of American English \u2014
p239
aVlook, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,
p240
aVbut there's no California!
p241
aVWe're missing California from American English.
p242
aVWe just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
p243
aVWe don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo again, lexicography is not rocket science.
p246
aVBut even if it were, rocket science is being done
p247
aVby dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
p248
aVIt can't be that hard to find some words!
p249
aVSo, enough scientists in other disciplines
p250
aVare really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
p251
aVFor instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers
p252
aVcan upload information about their bird sightings.
p253
aVAnd then, ornithologists can go
p254
aVand help track populations, migrations, etc.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
p257
aVHe's a director of an electroplating company.
p258
aVHe's found more than 140 comets.
p259
aVHe's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
p260
aVIt's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
p261
aVI don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
p262
aVBut he found 140 comets without a telescope.
p263
aVHe downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,
p264
aVand that's how he found them.
p265
aVIf we can find comets without a telescope,
p266
aVshouldn't we be able to find words?
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, y'all know where I'm going with this.
p269
aVBecause I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
p270
aVAnd the Internet is great for collecting words,
p271
aVbecause the Internet's full of collectors.
p272
aVAnd this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,
p273
aVbut the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
p274
aVAnd words and enthusiasm actually happen to be
p275
aVthe recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
p276
aVSo there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,
p277
aVbut the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
p278
aVThey show the word, but they don't show any context.
p279
aVWhere did it come from? Who said it?
p280
aVWhat newspaper was it in? What book?
p281
aa(lp282
VBecause a word is like an archaeological artifact.
p283
aVIf you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,
p284
aVit's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
p285
aVSo a word without its source is like a cut flower.
p286
aVYou know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
p287
aVIt dies too fast.
p288
aVSo, this whole time I've been saying,
p289
aV"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
p290
aVNot "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,
p291
aVwell, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
p292
aVThey use it synecdochically.
p293
aVAnd one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"
p294
aVis that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
p295
aVThis whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point
p296
aVwhere I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
p297
aVSo I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something \u2014
p298
aVlike the dictionary is a part of the language,
p299
aVor a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country \u2014
p300
aVthen you're using it synecdochically.
p301
aVBut the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
p302
aVIf we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
p303
aVWe can put in all the meanings.
p304
aVDoesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
p305
aVAnd we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language \u2014
p306
aVwe can make it be the whole language.
p307
aa(lp308
VYou see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,
p309
aVwho turns seven this month \u2014 I want him to barely remember
p310
aVthat this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
p311
aVThis is what dictionaries used to look like.
p312
aVI want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
p313
aVIt's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
p314
aVIt wasn't really what people needed.
p315
aVAnd the thing is, if we can put in all the words,
p316
aVno longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,
p317
aVwe can really describe the language like scientists.
p318
aVWe can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
p319
aVIf we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,
p320
aVand I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
p321
aVThank you very much for your kind attention.
