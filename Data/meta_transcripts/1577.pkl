aa(lp9
VA few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube
p10
aVof Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords
p11
aVat the early stages of her recovery
p12
aVfrom one of those awful bullets.
p13
aVThis one entered her left hemisphere, and
p14
aVknocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain.
p15
aVAnd in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist,
p16
aVand she's struggling to produce
p17
aVsome of the most basic words, and you can see her
p18
aVgrowing more and more devastated, until she ultimately
p19
aVbreaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing
p20
aVwordlessly into the arms of her therapist.
p21
aVAnd after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack,
p22
aVand they start singing together,
p23
aVand Gabby starts to sing through her tears,
p24
aVand you can hear her clearly able to enunciate
p25
aVthe words to a song that describe the way she feels,
p26
aVand she sings, in one descending scale, she sings,
p27
aV"Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."
p28
aVAnd it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how
p29
aVthe beauty of music has the ability to speak
p30
aVwhere words fail, in this case literally speak.
p31
aa(lp32
VSeeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me
p33
aVof the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug,
p34
aVone of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard,
p35
aVand Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called
p36
aVMelodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.
p37
aVSchlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic,
p38
aVcould not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences,
p39
aVbut they could still sing the lyrics to a song,
p40
aVwhether it was "Happy Birthday To You"
p41
aVor their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.
p42
aVAnd after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons,
p43
aVhe found that the music was able to literally rewire
p44
aVthe brains of his patients and create a homologous
p45
aVspeech center in their right hemisphere
p46
aVto compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhen I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon
p49
aVhe walked me through some of the leading research
p50
aVon music and the brain \u2014 how musicians had
p51
aVfundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians,
p52
aVhow music, and listening to music,
p53
aVcould just light up the entire brain, from
p54
aVour prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum,
p55
aVhow music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality
p56
aVto help children with autism, to help people struggling
p57
aVwith stress and anxiety and depression,
p58
aVhow deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor
p59
aVand their gait would steady when they listened to music,
p60
aVand how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia
p61
aVwas so far progressed that they could no longer recognize
p62
aVtheir family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin
p63
aVat the piano that they had learned when they were children.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug,
p66
aVand it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life,
p67
aVtrying to choose between music and medicine.
p68
aVI had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working
p69
aVas a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe,
p70
aVstudying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen
p71
aVin love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon.
p72
aVI wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes,
p73
aVthese kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia
p74
aVand work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant
p75
aVtuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.
p76
aVI wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor,
p77
aVthat doctor without borders.
p78
aVOn the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.
p79
aa(lp80
VMusic for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
p81
aVIt was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied
p82
aVat the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played
p83
aVmy debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv,
p84
aVand it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug
p85
aVhad studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory,
p86
aVbut had given up his love for music to pursue a career
p87
aVin medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,
p88
aV"How was it for you making that decision?"
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd he said that there were still times when he wished
p91
aVhe could go back and play the organ the way he used to,
p92
aVand that for me, medical school could wait,
p93
aVbut that the violin simply would not.
p94
aVAnd after two more years of studying music, I decided
p95
aVto shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT
p96
aVand applying to medical school like a good Indian son
p97
aVto become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter)
p98
aVAnd I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took
p99
aVan audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.
p100
aVIt was my first audition, and after three days of playing
p101
aVbehind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.
p102
aVAnd it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform
p103
aVin an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall
p104
aVin an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel,
p105
aVbut much more importantly to me to be surrounded
p106
aVby musicians and mentors that became my new family,
p107
aVmy new musical home.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut a year later, I met another musician who had also
p110
aVstudied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me
p111
aVfind my voice and shaped my identity as a musician.
p112
aVNathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but
p113
aVhe suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s,
p114
aVwas treated with thorazine at Bellevue,
p115
aVand ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row
p116
aVin downtown Los Angeles 30 years later.
p117
aVNathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness
p118
aVand mental health advocacy throughout the United States,
p119
aVas told through the book and the movie "The Soloist,"
p120
aVbut I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher,
p121
aVand I told him that wherever he had his violin,
p122
aVand wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row,
p125
aVI witnessed how music was able to bring him back
p126
aVfrom his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me
p127
aVin my untrained eye to be
p128
aVthe beginnings of a schizophrenic episode.
p129
aVPlaying for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning,
p130
aVbecause now it was about communication,
p131
aVa communication where words failed, a communication
p132
aVof a message that went deeper than words, that registered
p133
aVat a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche,
p134
aVyet came as a true musical offering from me.
p135
aVI found myself growing outraged that someone
p136
aVlike Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row
p137
aVbecause of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands
p138
aVof others there were out there on Skid Row alone
p139
aVwho had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie
p140
aVmade about them that got them off the streets?
p141
aVAnd at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow
p142
aVthe life of music had chosen me, where somehow,
p143
aVperhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row
p144
aVreally needed was somebody like Paul Farmer
p145
aVand not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me
p148
aVthat if I was truly passionate about change,
p149
aVif I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it,
p150
aVthat music was the bridge that connected my world and his.
p151
aa(lp152
VThere's a beautiful quote
p153
aVby the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann,
p154
aVwho said, "To send light into the darkness of men's hearts,
p155
aVsuch is the duty of the artist."
p156
aVAnd this is a particularly poignant quote
p157
aVbecause Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia
p158
aVand died in asylum.
p159
aVAnd inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel,
p160
aVI started an organization on Skid Row of musicians
p161
aVcalled Street Symphony, bringing the light of music
p162
aVinto the very darkest places, performing
p163
aVfor the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics
p164
aVon Skid Row, performing for combat veterans
p165
aVwith post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated
p166
aVand those labeled as criminally insane.
p167
aa(lp168
VAfter one of our events at the Patton State Hospital
p169
aVin San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us
p170
aVand she had tears streaming down her face,
p171
aVand she had a palsy, she was shaking,
p172
aVand she had this gorgeous smile, and she said
p173
aVthat she had never heard classical music before,
p174
aVshe didn't think she was going to like it, she had never
p175
aVheard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine,
p176
aVand that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years,
p177
aVwhen she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.
p178
aa(lp179
VSuddenly, what we're finding with these concerts,
p180
aVaway from the stage, away from the footlights, out
p181
aVof the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit
p182
aVfor delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits
p183
aVof music on the brain to an audience that would never
p184
aVhave access to this room,
p185
aVwould never have access to the kind of music that we make.
p186
aVJust as medicine serves to heal more
p187
aVthan the building blocks of the body alone,
p188
aVthe power and beauty of music transcends the "E"
p189
aVin the middle of our beloved acronym.
p190
aVMusic transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.
p191
aVThe synchrony of emotions that we experience when we
p192
aVhear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms,
p193
aVor chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember
p194
aVour shared, common humanity, the deeply communal
p195
aVconnected consciousness, the empathic consciousness
p196
aVthat neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired
p197
aVinto our brain's right hemisphere.
p198
aVAnd for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions
p199
aVof mental illness within homelessness
p200
aVand incarceration, the music and the beauty of music
p201
aVoffers a chance for them to transcend the world around them,
p202
aVto remember that they still have the capacity to experience
p203
aVsomething beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them.
p204
aVAnd the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity
p205
aVtransforms into hope,
p206
aVand we know, whether we choose the path of music
p207
aVor of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill
p208
aVwithin our communities, within our audiences,
p209
aVif we want to inspire healing from within.
p210
aa(lp211
VI'd like to end with a quote by John Keats,
p212
aVthe Romantic English poet,
p213
aVa very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.
p214
aVKeats himself had also given up a career in medicine
p215
aVto pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.
p216
aVAnd Keats said, "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty.
p217
aVThat is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."
