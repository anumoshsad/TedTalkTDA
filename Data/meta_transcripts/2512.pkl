VWhat do you see?
p4
aVMost of you see a barbershop,
p5
aVbut I see an opportunity:
p6
aVan opportunity for health,
p7
aVan opportunity for health equity.
p8
aa(lp9
VFor black men, the barbershop is not just a place
p10
aVwhere you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed.
p11
aVNo, it's much more than that.
p12
aVHistorically, the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men.
p13
aVIt's a place where we go for friendship,
p14
aVsolidarity and solace.
p15
aVIt's a place where we go to get away from the stress
p16
aVof the grind of work
p17
aVand sometimes home life.
p18
aVIt's a place where we don't have to worry
p19
aVabout how we're being perceived by the outside world.
p20
aVIt's a place where we don't feel threatened,
p21
aVor threatening.
p22
aVIt's a place of loyalty and trust.
p23
aVFor that reason,
p24
aVit's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves
p25
aVand just ... talk.
p26
aVThe talk, the shop talk, the conversation,
p27
aVthat is the essence of the black barbershop.
p28
aa(lp29
VI can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid.
p30
aVWe went to Mr. Mike's barbershop every other Saturday.
p31
aVAnd like clockwork, the same group of men would be there
p32
aVevery time we went,
p33
aVeither waiting on their favorite barber
p34
aVor just soaking up the atmosphere.
p35
aa(lp36
VI can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us
p37
aVevery time we went.
p38
aa(lp39
V"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.
p40
aVHe's a local pastor, and they treated him like a celebrity.
p41
aa(lp42
V"Hey young fella, how you doing?"
p43
aVthey would say to me,
p44
aVmaking me feel just as special.
p45
aa(lp46
VI remember the range of the conversations was immense.
p47
aVThe men would talk about politics and sports and music
p48
aVand world news, national news,
p49
aVneighborhood news.
p50
aVThere was some talk about women
p51
aVand what it was like to be a black man in America.
p52
aVBut many times they also talked about health.
p53
aVThe conversations about health were lengthy and deep.
p54
aVThe men often recounted their doctor's recommendations
p55
aVto cut salt in their diet
p56
aVor to eat less fried foods
p57
aVor to stop smoking
p58
aVor to reduce stress.
p59
aVThey talked about the different ways you could reduce stress,
p60
aVlike simplifying one's love life \u2014
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
Vall ways to treat high blood pressure.
p65
aa(lp66
VThere's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop.
p67
aVThat's because almost 40 percent of black men have it.
p68
aVThat means that almost every single black man
p69
aVeither has high blood pressure
p70
aVor knows a black man who has it.
p71
aa(lp72
VSometimes, those conversations in the barbershop
p73
aVwould be about what happens when high blood pressure
p74
aVis not adequately addressed.
p75
aa(lp76
V"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? He had a stroke."
p77
aa(lp78
V"Did you hear about Eddie? He died last week.
p79
aVMassive heart attack.
p80
aVHe was 50."
p81
aa(lp82
VMore black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else,
p83
aVeven though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated
p84
aVthat death from high blood pressure can be prevented
p85
aVwith timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men?
p88
aVBecause too often, high blood pressure is either untreated
p89
aVor under-treated in black men,
p90
aVin part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system.
p91
aVBlack men, in particular those with high blood pressure,
p92
aVare less likely to have a primary care doctor
p93
aVthan other groups.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut why?
p96
aVSome of our earliest research on black men's health
p97
aVrevealed that for many, the doctor's office is associated with fear,
p98
aVmistrust,
p99
aVdisrespect,
p100
aVand unnecessary unpleasantness.
p101
aVThe doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well.
p102
aVAnd when you do go, you might wait for hours
p103
aVonly to get the run-around
p104
aVand to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat
p105
aVwho only has 10 minutes to give you
p106
aVand who doesn't value the talk.
p107
aVSo it's no wonder that some men don't want to be bothered
p108
aVand skip going to the doctor altogether,
p109
aVespecially if they feel fine.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut herein lies the problem.
p112
aVYou can feel just fine
p113
aVwhile high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is Denny Moe,
p116
aVowner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.
p117
aVI've been lucky enough to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years.
p118
aa(lp119
VHe said to me once,
p120
aV"Hey Doc, you know,
p121
aVlots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors."
p122
aa(lp123
VThis was stunning to me,
p124
aVat first,
p125
aVbut not so much when you think about it.
p126
aVBlack men have been with their current barbers
p127
aVon average as long as I've been with Denny,
p128
aVabout eight years.
p129
aVAnd black men see their barbers about every two weeks.
p130
aVNot only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style,
p131
aVbut you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life.
p132
aVDenny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist,
p133
aVa businessman and confidant.
p134
aVHe's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community.
p135
aVThe very first time I walked into Denny Moe's shop,
p136
aVhe wasn't just cutting hair.
p137
aVHe was also orchestrating a voter registration drive
p138
aVto give a voice to his customers and his community.
p139
aa(lp140
VWith this kind of activism,
p141
aVand community investment that typifies the black barbershop,
p142
aVof course the barbershop is a perfect place
p143
aVto talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community.
p144
aa(lp145
VFirst, the barbershop is not a medical setting,
p146
aVand so it doesn't have all the negative psychological baggage
p147
aVthat comes along with that.
p148
aVWhen you're in a barbershop,
p149
aVyou're in your territory, and you're among friends
p150
aVwho share your history,
p151
aVyour struggle and your health risks.
p152
aa(lp153
VSecond, because the barbershop is a place of connection,
p154
aVloyalty and trust,
p155
aVit's a place where you're more open to have a conversation about health
p156
aVand especially about high blood pressure.
p157
aVAfter all,
p158
aVconversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk:
p159
aVstress and high blood pressure,
p160
aVfood and high blood pressure,
p161
aVrelationships and high blood pressure,
p162
aVand yes, what it's like to be a black man in America
p163
aVand high blood pressure.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure
p166
aVin the barbershop.
p167
aVYou can concretely take action.
p168
aVHere we have an opportunity to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world
p169
aVand empower communities to address the health inequities
p170
aVthat uniquely affect it.
p171
aVWhen high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals
p172
aVto communities in the 1960s and '70s,
p173
aVblack physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore
p174
aVand Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans
p175
aVwere at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs
p176
aVin urban black neighborhoods.
p177
aa(lp178
VThese pioneers paved the way for my professional journey
p179
aVwith barbershops and health,
p180
aVwhich began in Chicago in medical school.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe very first research project that I worked on as a medical student
p183
aVwas to help design healthcare interventions
p184
aVthat would appeal to black men.
p185
aVWe conducted about a dozen focus groups
p186
aVwith a broad cross-section of black men,
p187
aVand we learned that for them,
p188
aVbeing healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy
p189
aVas it was about feeling healthy,
p190
aVand that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good.
p191
aVThis work led to the development of Project Brotherhood,
p192
aVa community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker
p193
aVthat provided tailored healthcare to black men.
p194
aVPart of this tailored care
p195
aVinvolved having a barber on the premises
p196
aVto reward the men who came for needed healthcare
p197
aVwith a free haircut,
p198
aVto let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked
p199
aVas well as how they felt,
p200
aVand that what was important to them was also important to us.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut while there's only one Project Brotherhood,
p203
aVthere are thousands of black barbershops
p204
aVwhere the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated.
p205
aVThe next stop on my journey was Dallas, Texas,
p206
aVwhere we learned that barbers were not only willing
p207
aVbut fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate
p208
aVin delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers
p209
aVand their community.
p210
aVWe teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers
p211
aVand taught them how to measure blood pressure
p212
aVand how to counsel their customers
p213
aVand refer them to doctors
p214
aVto help manage high blood pressure.
p215
aVThe barbers were not only willing to do it
p216
aVbut they were damn good at it.
p217
aVOver a three-year period,
p218
aVthe barbers measured thousands of blood pressures
p219
aVresulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors
p220
aVfor medical care of their high blood pressure.
p221
aVThese barber-doctor partnerships
p222
aVresulted in a 20 percent increase in the number of men
p223
aVwho were able to achieve target blood pressure levels
p224
aVand a three-point drop, on average,
p225
aVin the blood pressure of each participant.
p226
aVIf we were to extrapolate that three point drop
p227
aVto every single black man with high blood pressure in America,
p228
aVwe would prevent 800 heart attacks, 500 strokes and 900 deaths
p229
aVfrom high blood pressure
p230
aVin just one year.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd our experience with barbershops has been no different in New York City,
p233
aVwhere my journey has currently led me.
p234
aVWith an incredible team of diverse research assistants,
p235
aVcommunity health workers and volunteers,
p236
aVwe've been able to partner with over 200 barbershops
p237
aVand other trusted community venues
p238
aVto reach over 7,000 older black men.
p239
aVAnd we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling
p240
aVto each and every one of them.
p241
aVThanks to Denny Moe
p242
aVand the myriad other barbers and community leaders
p243
aVwho shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment
p244
aVto make a difference in their communities,
p245
aVwe've been able to not only lower blood pressure
p246
aVin our participants,
p247
aVbut we've also been able to impact other health indicators.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo what do you see?
p250
aVWhat is your barbershop?
p251
aVWhere is that place for you
p252
aVwhere people who are affected by a unique problem
p253
aVcan meet a unique solution?
p254
aVWhen you find that place, see the opportunity.
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you.
