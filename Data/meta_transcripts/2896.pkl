VI recently read about what the young generation of workers want
p4
aVin Harvard Business Review.
p5
aVOne thing that stuck out to me was: don't just talk about impact,
p6
aVbut make an impact.
p7
aVI'm a little bit older than you,
p8
aVmaybe much older than you,
p9
aVbut this is exactly the same goal that I had when I was in college.
p10
aVI wanted to make my own impact for those who live under injustice;
p11
aVit's the reason that I became a documentary journalist,
p12
aVthe reason I became
p13
aVa prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.
p14
aa(lp15
VIt was March 17, 2009.
p16
aVIt is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,
p17
aVbut it was the day that turned my life upside down.
p18
aVMy team and I were making a documentary about North Korean refugees
p19
aVliving below human life in China.
p20
aVWe were at the border.
p21
aVIt was our last day of filming.
p22
aVThere was no wire fence
p23
aVor bars
p24
aVor sign to show that it is the border,
p25
aVbut this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use
p26
aVas an escape route.
p27
aVIt was still winter,
p28
aVand the river was frozen.
p29
aVWhen we were in the middle of the frozen river,
p30
aVwe were filming about the condition of the cold weather
p31
aVand the environment
p32
aVthat North Koreans had to deal with
p33
aVwhen they seek their freedom.
p34
aVAnd suddenly, one of my team members shouted,
p35
aV"Soldiers!"
p36
aVSo I looked back,
p37
aVand there were two small soldiers in green uniforms with rifles,
p38
aVchasing after us.
p39
aVWe all ran as fast as we could.
p40
aVI prayed that, please don't let them shoot my head.
p41
aVAnd I was thinking that,
p42
aVif my feet are on Chinese soil,
p43
aVI'll be safe.
p44
aVAnd I made it to Chinese soil.
p45
aVThen I saw my colleague Laura Ling fall on her knees.
p46
aVI didn't know what to do at that short moment,
p47
aVbut I knew that I could not leave her alone there
p48
aVwhen she said, "Euna, I can't feel my legs."
p49
aa(lp50
VIn a flash, we were surrounded by these two Korean soldiers.
p51
aVThey were not much bigger than us,
p52
aVbut they were determined to take us to their army base.
p53
aVI begged and yelled for any kind of help,
p54
aVhoping that someone would show up from China.
p55
aVHere I was, being stubborn
p56
aVtowards a trained soldier with a gun.
p57
aVI looked at his eyes.
p58
aVHe was just a boy.
p59
aVAt that moment, he raised his rifle to hit me,
p60
aVbut I saw that he was hesitating.
p61
aVHis eyes were shaking,
p62
aVand his rifle was still up in the air.
p63
aVSo I shouted at him,
p64
aV"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."
p65
aVAnd I got up.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen we arrived at their army base,
p68
aVmy head was spinning with these worst-case scenarios,
p69
aVand my colleague's statement wasn't helping.
p70
aVShe said, "We are the enemy."
p71
aVShe was right: we were the enemy.
p72
aVAnd I was supposed to be frightened, too.
p73
aVBut I kept having these odd experiences.
p74
aVThis time, an officer brought me his coat
p75
aVto keep me warm,
p76
aVbecause I lost my coat on the frozen river
p77
aVwhile battling with one of these soldiers.
p78
aa(lp79
VI will tell you what I mean by these odd experiences.
p80
aVI grew up in South Korea.
p81
aVTo us, North Korea was always the enemy,
p82
aVeven before I was born.
p83
aVSouth and North have been under armistice for 63 years,
p84
aVsince the end of the Korean War.
p85
aVAnd growing up in the South in the '80s and '90s,
p86
aVwe were taught propaganda about North Korea.
p87
aVAnd we heard so many graphic stories,
p88
aVsuch as, a little young boy being brutally killed
p89
aVby North Korean spies just because he said,
p90
aV"I don't like communists."
p91
aVOr, I watched this cartoon series
p92
aVabout a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig,
p93
aVwhich represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time.
p94
aVAnd the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over
p95
aVinstilled one word in a young mind:
p96
aV"enemy."
p97
aVAnd I think at some point, I dehumanized them,
p98
aVand the people of North Korea became equated
p99
aVwith the North Korean government.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, back to my detention.
p102
aVIt was the second day
p103
aVof being in a cell.
p104
aVI had not slept since I was out at the border.
p105
aVThis young guard came to my cell
p106
aVand offered me this small boiled egg
p107
aVand said, "This will give you strength to keep going."
p108
aVDo you know what it is like,
p109
aVreceiving a small kindness in the enemy's hand?
p110
aVWhenever they were kind to me, I thought the worst case
p111
aVwas waiting for me after the kindness.
p112
aVOne officer noticed my nervousness.
p113
aVHe said, "Did you think we were all these red pigs?"
p114
aVreferring to the cartoon that I just showed you.
p115
aVEvery day was like a psychological battle.
p116
aVThe interrogator had me sit at a table
p117
aVsix days a week
p118
aVand had me writing down about my journey, my work,
p119
aVover and over until I wrote down the confession that they wanted to hear.
p120
aa(lp121
VAfter about three months of detention,
p122
aVthe North Korean court sentenced me
p123
aVto 12 years in a labor camp.
p124
aVSo I was just sitting in my room to be transferred.
p125
aVAt that time, I really had nothing else to do,
p126
aVso I paid attention to these two female guards
p127
aVand listened to what they were talking about.
p128
aVGuard A was older,
p129
aVand she studied English.
p130
aVShe seemed like she came from an affluent family.
p131
aVShe often showed up with these colorful dresses,
p132
aVand then loved to show off.
p133
aVAnd Guard B was the younger one,
p134
aVand she was a really good singer.
p135
aVShe loved to sing Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" \u2014
p136
aVsometimes too much.
p137
aVShe knew just how to torture me without knowing.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd this girl spent a lot of time in the morning to put on makeup,
p142
aVlike you can see in any young girl's life.
p143
aVAnd they loved to watch this Chinese drama,
p144
aVa better quality production.
p145
aVI remember Guard B said,
p146
aV"I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this."
p147
aVShe got scolded
p148
aVfor degrading her own country's produced TV shows.
p149
aVGuard B had more of a free mind than Guard A,
p150
aVand she often got scolded by Guard A whenever she expressed herself.
p151
aa(lp152
VOne day, they invited all these female colleagues \u2014
p153
aVI don't know where they came from \u2014
p154
aVto where I was held,
p155
aVand they invited me
p156
aVto their guard room
p157
aVand asked
p158
aVif one-night stands really happen in the US.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VThis is the country where young couples are not even allowed
p163
aVto hold hands in public.
p164
aVI had no idea where they had gotten this information,
p165
aVbut they were shy and giggly even before I said anything.
p166
aVI think we all forgot that I was their prisoner,
p167
aVand it was like going back to my high school classroom again.
p168
aVAnd I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon,
p169
aVbut just propaganda towards South Korea and the US.
p170
aVI started to understand where these people's anger was coming from.
p171
aVIf these girls grew up learning that we are enemies,
p172
aVit was just natural that they would hate us
p173
aVjust as I feared them.
p174
aVBut at that moment, we were all just girls
p175
aVwho shared the same interests,
p176
aVbeyond our ideologies that separated us.
p177
aa(lp178
VI shared these stories with my boss at Current TV at the time
p179
aVafter I came home.
p180
aVHis first reaction was,
p181
aV"Euna, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?"
p182
aVYes, and I clearly remember
p183
aVthe feeling of fear
p184
aVand being threatened,
p185
aVand tension rising up between me and the interrogator
p186
aVwhen we talked about politics.
p187
aVThere definitely was a wall that we couldn't climb over.
p188
aVBut we were able to see each other as human beings
p189
aVwhen we talked about family,
p190
aVeveryday life,
p191
aVthe importance of the future for our children.
p192
aa(lp193
VIt was about a month before I came home.
p194
aVI got really sick.
p195
aVGuard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,
p196
aVbecause she was leaving the detention center.
p197
aVShe made sure that no one watched us,
p198
aVno one heard us,
p199
aVand quietly said,
p200
aV"I hope you get better
p201
aVand go back to your family soon."
p202
aVIt is these people \u2014
p203
aVthe officer who brought me his coat,
p204
aVthe guard who offered me a boiled egg,
p205
aVthese female guards who asked me about dating life in the US \u2014
p206
aVthey are the ones that I remember of North Korea:
p207
aVhumans just like us.
p208
aVNorth Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries,
p209
aVbut I believe that we were representing
p210
aVthe human race.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow I'm back home and back to my life.
p213
aVThe memory of these people has blurred as time has passed.
p214
aVAnd I'm in this place
p215
aVwhere I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US.
p216
aVI realized how easy it is
p217
aVto see them as an enemy again.
p218
aVBut I have to keep reminding myself that when I was over there,
p219
aVI was able to see humanity
p220
aVover hatred
p221
aVin my enemy's eyes.
p222
aa(lp223
VThank you.
