VNow, I've been making pictures for quite a long time,
p4
aVand normally speaking, a picture like this, for me,
p5
aVshould be straightforward.
p6
aVI'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach.
p7
aVThere's a big family, there's a very beautiful tree,
p8
aVand I make these pictures with this very large,
p9
aVextremely cumbersome, very awkward technical plate film camera.
p10
aVDoes anybody know 4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,
p11
aVand you're setting it up, putting it on the tripod.
p12
aVI've got the family, spent the better part of a day talking with them.
p13
aVThey sort of understand what I'm on about.
p14
aVThey think I'm a bit crazy, but that's another story.
p15
aVAnd what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic,
p16
aVand that's based on the light.
p17
aVSo the light's setting on my left-hand side,
p18
aVand there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach,
p19
aVthe family of 30, all ages.
p20
aVThere's babies and there's grandparents,
p21
aVI'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set,
p22
aVand it's going, going, and I've got one sheet of film left,
p23
aVand I think, I'm okay, I'm in control, I'm in control.
p24
aVI'm setting it up and I'm setting up, and the light's just about to go,
p25
aVand I want it to be golden, I want it to be beautiful.
p26
aVI want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people,
p27
aVin all the potential glory that they could be presented.
p28
aVAnd it's about to go  and it's about to go,
p29
aVand I put my sheet in the camera,
p30
aVit's all focused,
p31
aVand all of a sudden there's a massive "whack,"
p32
aVand I'm looking around, and in the top corner of the tree,
p33
aVone of the girls slaps the girl next to her,
p34
aVand the girl next to her pulls her hair, and all hell breaks loose,
p35
aVand I'm standing there going, "But the light, the light.
p36
aVWait, I need the light. Stay still! Stay still!"
p37
aVAnd they start screaming,
p38
aVand then one of the men turns around and starts screaming, shouting,
p39
aVand the whole tree collapses, not the tree, but the people in the tree.
p40
aVThey're all running around screaming, and they run back off into the village
p41
aVin this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm left there standing behind my tripod.
p42
aVI've got my sheet, and the light's gone, and I can't make the picture.
p43
aVWhere have they all gone? I had no idea.
p44
aa(lp45
VIt took me a week, it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today,
p46
aVand I'll tell you why. (Applause)
p47
aVIt's very, very, very simple \u2014 I spent a week going around the village,
p48
aVand I went to every single one: "Hello, can you meet at the tree?
p49
aVWhat's your story? Who are you?"
p50
aVAnd it all turned out to be about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.
p51
aVI mean, I have teenage kids. I should know.
p52
aVIt was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,
p53
aVand they'd started having a fight.
p54
aVAnd there was a very, very beautiful lesson for me in that:
p55
aVIf I was going to photograph these people
p56
aVin the dignified, respectful way that I had intended,
p57
aVand put them on a pedestal, I had to understand them.
p58
aVIt wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand.
p59
aVIt wasn't about just saying, "I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."
p60
aVI had to get to know every single one of them,
p61
aVright down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo in the end, a week later,
p64
aVand I was absolutely exhausted,
p65
aVI mean on my knees going, "Please get back up in that tree.
p66
aVIt's a picture I need to make."
p67
aVThey all came back. I put them all back up in the tree.
p68
aVI made sure the girls were in the right position,
p69
aVand the ones that slapped, one was over there.
p70
aVThey did look at each other. If you look at it later,
p71
aVthey're staring at each other very angrily,
p72
aVand I've got the tree and everything,
p73
aVand then at the last minute, I go, "The goat, the goat!
p74
aVI need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle."
p75
aVSo I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in.
p76
aVBut even then I got it wrong, because if you can see on the left-hand side,
p77
aVanother little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat.
p78
aVSo the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut anyway, the effort that goes into that picture
p81
aVand the story that I've just related to you,
p82
aVas you can imagine,
p83
aVthere are hundreds of other bizarre, eccentric stories
p84
aVof hundreds of other people around the world.
p85
aVAnd this was about four years ago, and I set off on a journey,
p86
aVto be honest, a very indulgent journey.
p87
aVI'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist, perhaps in some ways naive.
p88
aVBut I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful.
p89
aVIt's very, very simple. It's not rocket science.
p90
aVI wanted to put these people on a pedestal.
p91
aVI wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before.
p92
aVSo, I chose about 35 different groups,
p93
aVtribes, indigenous cultures.
p94
aVThey were chosen purely because of their aesthetic,
p95
aVand I'll talk more about that later.
p96
aVI'm not an anthropologist, I have no technical study with the subject,
p97
aVbut I do have a very, very, very deep passion,
p98
aVand I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet
p99
aVin the most beautiful environment that they lived in,
p100
aVand put the two together and present them to you.
p101
aa(lp102
VAbout a year ago,
p103
aVI published the first pictures,
p104
aVand something extraordinarily exciting happened.
p105
aVThe whole world came running,
p106
aVand it was a bizarre experience, because everybody, from everywhere:
p107
aV"Who are they? What are they? How many are they?
p108
aVWhere did you find them? Are they real? You faked it.
p109
aVTell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me." Millions of questions for which,
p110
aVto be honest, I don't have the answers.
p111
aVI really didn't have the answers,
p112
aVand I could sort of understand, okay, they're beautiful, that was my intention,
p113
aVbut the questions that I was being fired at,
p114
aVI could not answer them.
p115
aa(lp116
VUntil, it was quite amusing, about a year ago
p117
aVsomebody said, "You've been invited to do a TED Talk."
p118
aVAnd I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted? I haven't met Ted before."
p119
aVHe said, "No, a TED Talk." I said, "But who's Ted?
p120
aVDo I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage?"
p121
aVAnd, "No, no, the TED group. You must know about it."
p122
aVAnd I said, "I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years.
p123
aVHow do I know who Ted is? Introduce me to him."
p124
aVAnyway, to cut a long story short, he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."
p125
aVResearched. Oh, exciting. That's great!
p126
aVAnd then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal.
p127
aVEven more exciting.
p128
aVBut what you need to do, you need to teach the people lessons,
p129
aVlessons that you've learned on your travels around the world
p130
aVwith these tribes.
p131
aVI thought, lessons, okay, well, what did I learn? Good question.
p132
aVThree. You need three lessons, and they need to be terribly profound.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVAnd I thought, three lessons, well, I'm going to think about it.
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I thought long and hard, and I stood here two days ago,
p138
aVand I had my test run, and I had my cards
p139
aVand my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen,
p140
aVand I had my three lessons, and I started presenting them,
p141
aVand I had this very odd out-of-body experience.
p142
aVI sort of looked at myself standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,
p143
aVthis is complete loads of codswallop.
p144
aVAll these people sitting here, they've had more of these talks,
p145
aVthey've heard more lessons in their life.
p146
aVWho are you to tell them what you've learned?
p147
aVWho are you to guide them and who are you to show them
p148
aVwhat is right, what is wrong, what these people have to say?"
p149
aVAnd I had a little bit of a, it was very private,
p150
aVa little bit of a meltdown.
p151
aVI went back, and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats,
p152
aVvery disgruntled, going, that didn't work,
p153
aVIt wasn't what I wanted to communicate.
p154
aVAnd I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing
p155
aVI can communicate is very, very basic.
p156
aVYou have to turn it all the way around.
p157
aVThere's only one person I know here, and that's me.
p158
aVI'm still getting to know myself,
p159
aVand it's a lifelong journey, and I probably won't have all the answers,
p160
aVbut I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons.
p163
aVIt's a very, as I explained at the beginning, very indulgent, very personal,
p164
aVhow and why I made these pictures,
p165
aVand I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons
p166
aVhave meant to me, what they could perhaps mean to you.
p167
aa(lp168
VI traveled enormously as a child.
p169
aVI was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting.
p170
aVAll around the world,
p171
aVand I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed
p172
aVto become somebody, become that individual, Jimmy.
p173
aVGo off into the planet, and so I ran, and I ran,
p174
aVand my wife sometimes kids me, "Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"
p175
aVbut I'm, "No, it's all about something, trust me."
p176
aVSo I kept running and I kept running, and I sort of got somewhere
p177
aVand I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought, well,
p178
aVwhere do I belong? Where do I fit?
p179
aVWhat am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.
p180
aVSo I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience.
p181
aVPerhaps part of this journey
p182
aVis about me trying to find out where I belonged.
p183
aVSo whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't when I arrived with these tribes,
p184
aVI didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut what I did find were people that belonged themselves,
p187
aVand they inspired me, some extraordinary people,
p188
aVand I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine.
p189
aVThey're the Huli.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people
p192
aVon the planet.
p193
aVThey're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands.
p194
aVThere's not many of them left, and they're called the Huli wigmen.
p195
aVAnd images like this, I mean, this is what it's all about for me.
p196
aVAnd you've spent weeks and months there talking with them, getting there,
p197
aVand I want to put them on a pedestal, and I said, "You have something
p198
aVthat many people have not seen.
p199
aVYou sit in this stunning nature."
p200
aVAnd it really does look like this, and they really do look like this.
p201
aVThis is the real thing.
p202
aVAnd you know why they're proud? You know why they look like this,
p203
aVand why I broke my back literally
p204
aVto photograph them and present them to you?
p205
aVIt's because they have these extraordinary rituals.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd the Huli have this ritual: When they're teenagers,
p208
aVbecoming a man, they have to shave their heads,
p209
aVand they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day,
p210
aVand what they do with that hair,
p211
aVthey make it into a creation,
p212
aVa creation that's a very personal creation.
p213
aVIt's their creation. It's their Huli creation.
p214
aVSo they're called the Huli wigmen.
p215
aVThat's a wig on his head.
p216
aVIt's all made out of his human hair.
p217
aVAnd then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise,
p218
aVand don't worry, there are many birds there.
p219
aVThere's very few people living, so nothing to get too upset about,
p220
aVand they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats
p221
aVand getting further and further,
p222
aVand it's extraordinary, and there's another group,
p223
aVthey're called the Kalam, and they live in the next valley,
p224
aVbut they speak a completely different language,
p225
aVthey look completely different, and they wear a hat,
p226
aVand it's built out of scarabs,
p227
aVthese fantastic emerald green little scarabs,
p228
aVand sometimes there are 5,000 or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,
p229
aVand they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs
p230
aVto build these hats.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo the Huli inspired me in that they belong.
p233
aVPerhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me
p234
aVand going back into my past to see where I actually fit.
p235
aa(lp236
VAn extremely important part of this project
p237
aVwas about how I photograph these extraordinary people.
p238
aVAnd it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters.
p239
aVWe spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty:
p240
aVbeautiful places, beautiful things, and ultimately, beautiful people.
p241
aVIt's very, very, very significant.
p242
aVI've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like?
p243
aVAm I perceived as beautiful?
p244
aVDoes it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not,
p245
aVor is it purely based on my aesthetic?
p246
aVAnd then when I went off, I came to a very narrow conclusion.
p247
aVDo I have to go around the world photographing, excuse me,
p248
aVwomen between the age of 25 and 30? Is that what beauty is going to be?
p249
aVIs everything before and after that utterly irrelevant?
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd it was only until I went on a journey,
p252
aVa journey that was so extreme,
p253
aVI still get shivers when I think about it.
p254
aVI went to a part of the world, and I don't know whether any of you
p255
aVhave ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?
p256
aVChukotka probably is, technically, as far as one can go
p257
aVand still be on the living planet.
p258
aVIt's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.
p259
aVFirst you've got to get to Moscow, and then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.
p260
aVAnd that's if you get there.
p261
aVAs you can see, some people sort of miss the runway.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd then when you land there, in Chukotka are the Chukchis.
p264
aVNow, the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia,
p265
aVand they're people I'd heard about, I'd hardly seen any images of,
p266
aVbut I knew they were there,
p267
aVand I'd been in touch with this guide,
p268
aVand this guide said,
p269
aV"There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about 40 of them.
p270
aVYou'll be okay. We'll find them." So off we went on this journey.
p271
aVWhen we arrived there, after a month of traveling across the ice,
p272
aVand we'd got to them, but then I was not allowed to photograph them.
p273
aVThey said, "You cannot photograph us. You have to wait.
p274
aVYou have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us.
p275
aVYou have to wait until you see how we interact with one another."
p276
aVAnd only then, it was many, many weeks later, I saw a respect.
p277
aVThey had zero judgment.
p278
aVThey observed one another, from the youth, from the middle aged to the old.
p279
aVThey need each other.
p280
aVThe children need to chew the meat all day
p281
aVbecause the adults don't have any teeth,
p282
aVbut at the same time, the children take the old aged people out
p283
aVto the toilet because they're infirm,
p284
aVso there's this fantastic community of respect.
p285
aVAnd they adore and admire one another, and they truly taught me
p286
aVwhat beauty was.
p287
aV(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VNow I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction.
p290
aVThis is extremely important for the end of my talk.
p291
aVIf you could look at somebody left to the right of you,
p292
aVand I want you to observe them,
p293
aVand I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important.
p294
aVNow, it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura, I don't mind,
p295
aVbut please look at each other, give them a compliment.
p296
aVYou have to be quick, because I'm running out of time.
p297
aVAnd you have to remember it.
p298
aa(lp299
VOkay, thank you, thank you, thank you, you've given each other compliments.
p300
aVHold that compliment very, very tightly. Hold it for later.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd the last thing, it was extraordinarily profound,
p303
aVand it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.
p304
aVNow, the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola,
p305
aVand I'd been there a few times before,
p306
aVand I'd gone back to present this book I'd made,
p307
aVto show them the pictures, to get into a discussion with them,
p308
aVto say, "This is how I saw you. This is how I love you.
p309
aVThis is how I respect you. What do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"
p310
aVSo I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional,
p311
aVand one night we were sitting around the campfire,
p312
aVand I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink,
p313
aVand I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great,
p314
aVyou've seen my pictures, we love each other." (Laughter)
p315
aVAnd I'm a little bit slow,
p316
aVand I looked around me, and I said,
p317
aVI thought, maybe, the fence is missing.
p318
aVWasn't there a fence here last time I came?
p319
aVYou know, this big protective fence around the village,
p320
aVand they sort of looked at me and go, "Yeah, chief die."
p321
aVAnd I thought, okay, chief dying, right, you know,
p322
aVlook up at the stars again, look at the campfire.
p323
aVChief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence?
p324
aV"Chief die.
p325
aVFirst we destroy, yeah? Then we reflect.
p326
aVThen we rebuild. Then we respect."
p327
aVAnd I burst out in tears, because my father had only just died
p328
aVprior to this journey,
p329
aVand I didn't ever acknowledge him,
p330
aVI didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today
p331
aVbecause of him.
p332
aVThese people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents
p333
aVand our grandparents and our forefathers
p334
aVgoing on and on and on before that,
p335
aVand I, no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey,
p336
aVI did not know that until two weeks ago.
p337
aVI did not know that until two weeks ago.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo what's this all about?
p340
aVWell, there's an image I'd like to show you,
p341
aVquite a special image, and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose.
p342
aVI was sitting there the other day, and I have to finish on a strong image.
p343
aVAnd somebody said, "You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."
p344
aVI was like, yeah, but that's not my favorite picture.
p345
aVShe went, "No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture.
p346
aVYou're in his eyes."
p347
aVI said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes? It's a picture of the Nenets."
p348
aVShe said, "No, look, look closely, you're in his eyes."
p349
aVAnd when you look closely at this picture, there is a reflection of me in his eyes,
p350
aVso I think perhaps he has my soul, and I'm in his soul,
p351
aVand whilst these pictures look at you, I ask you to look at them.
p352
aVYou may not be reflected in his eyes,
p353
aVbut there is something extraordinarily important about these people.
p354
aVI don't ultimately have the answers, as I've just shared with you,
p355
aVbut you must do. There must be something there.
p356
aVSo if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing
p357
aVabout beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots,
p358
aVand I need you all to stand for me, please.
p359
aV(Laughter)
p360
aVNow you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime,
p361
aVand this is not a standing ovation, so don't worry,
p362
aVI'm not fishing for compliments.
p363
aVBut you were given a compliment a few minutes ago.
p364
aVNow I want you to stand tall.
p365
aVI want you to breathe in. This is what I say.
p366
aVI'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks.
p367
aVI'm not going to ask you to carry a goat,
p368
aVand I know you don't have any camels.
p369
aVPhotography's extraordinarily powerful.
p370
aVIt's this language which we now all understand.
p371
aVWe truly do all understand it,
p372
aVand we have this global digital fireplace, don't we,
p373
aVbut I want to share you with the world,
p374
aVbecause you are also a tribe.
p375
aVYou are the TED tribe, yeah? But you have to remember that compliment.
p376
aVYou have to stand tall, breathe in through your nose,
p377
aVand I'm going to photograph you. Okay?
p378
aVI need to do a panoramic shot, so it's going to take a minute,
p379
aVso you have to concentrate, okay?
p380
aVBreathe in, stand tall, no laughing. Shh, breathe through your nose.
p381
aVI'm going to photograph.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Clicks)
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you.
p386
