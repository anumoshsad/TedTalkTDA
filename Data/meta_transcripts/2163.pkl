VIt's said that to be a poet
p4
aVyou have to go to hell and back.
p5
aa(lp6
VThe first time I visited the prison,
p7
aVI was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks,
p8
aVor the closing doors, or the cell bars,
p9
aVor by any of the things I had imagined.
p10
aa(lp11
VMaybe because the prison is in a quite open space.
p12
aVYou can see the sky.
p13
aVSeagulls fly overhead, and you feel like you're next to the sea,
p14
aVthat you're really close to the beach.
p15
aVBut in fact, the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison.
p16
aa(lp17
VI went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors.
p18
aVThen it was as if I stepped back and thought
p19
aVthat I could have very well been one of them.
p20
aVIf I had another story, another context, different luck.
p21
aVBecause nobody - nobody - can choose where they're born.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn 2009, I was invited to join a project
p24
aVthat San Martín National University conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,
p25
aVto coordinate a writing workshop.
p26
aVThe prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison,
p27
aVwhich is where they constructed the University Center building.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe first time I met with the prisoners,
p30
aVI asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop
p31
aVand they told me they wanted  to put on paper
p32
aVall that they couldn't say and do.
p33
aa(lp34
VRight then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison.
p35
aVSo I said to them why don't we work with poetry,
p36
aVif they knew what poetry was.
p37
aVBut nobody had a clue what poetry really was.
p38
aVThey also suggested to me
p39
aVthat the workshop should be not just for the inmates
p40
aVtaking university classes,  but for all the inmates.
p41
aVAnd so I said that to start this workshop,
p42
aVI needed to find a tool that we all had in common.
p43
aVThat tool was language.
p44
aa(lp45
VWe had language, we had the workshop. We could have poetry.
p46
aVBut what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison, too.
p47
aVMany of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school.
p48
aVMany couldn't use cursive, could barely print.
p49
aVThey didn't write fluently, either.
p50
aVSo we started looking for short poems.
p51
aVVery short, but very powerful.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd we started to read, and we'd read one author, then another author,
p54
aVand by reading such short poems, they all began to realize
p55
aVthat what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic,
p56
aVand create another system.
p57
aVBreaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system
p58
aVunder which they've learned to respond.
p59
aVSo a new system appeared,
p60
aVnew rules that made them understand very quickly,
p61
aV- very quickly -
p62
aVthat with poetic language
p63
aVthey would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back.
p66
aVAnd they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell.
p67
aa(lp68
VOne of them once said: "In prison you never sleep.
p69
aVYou can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids."
p70
aVAnd so, like I\u2019m doing now, I gave them a moment of silence,
p71
aVthen said, \u201cThat's what poetry is, you guys.
p72
aVIt's in this prison universe that you have all around you.
p73
aVEverything you say about how you never sleep,
p74
aVit exudes fear.
p75
aVAll the things that go unwritten \u2014 all of that is poetry."
p76
aa(lp77
VSo we started appropriating that hell;
p78
aVwe plunged ourselves, headfirst, into the seventh circle.
p79
aVAnd in that seventh circle of hell, our very own, beloved circle,
p80
aVthey learned that they could make the walls invisible,
p81
aVthat they could make the windows yell,
p82
aVand that we could hide inside the shadows.
p83
aVWhen the first year of the workshop had ended,
p84
aVwe organized a little closing party,
p85
aVlike you do when a job is done with so much love,
p86
aVand you want to celebrate with a party.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe called family, friends,  the university authorities.
p89
aVThe only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem,
p90
aVand receive their diplomas and applause.
p91
aVThat was our simple party.
p92
aVThe only thing I want to leave you with
p93
aVis the moment in which those men,
p94
aVsome of them just huge when standing next to me,
p95
aVor the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride,
p96
aVheld their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated,
p97
aVand read their poems with their voices completely broken.
p98
aa(lp99
VThat moment made me think a lot
p100
aVthat for most of them, it was surely the very first time
p101
aVthat someone applauded them for something they had done.
p102
aVIn prison there are things that can't be done.
p103
aVIn prison, you can't dream. In prison, you can't cry.
p104
aVThere are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time,"
p105
aVthe word "future," the word "wish".
p106
aVBut we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.
p107
aVWe decided that they were going to write a book.
p108
aVNot only did they write a book, but they also bound it themselves.
p109
aVThat was at the end of 2010.
p110
aVThen, we doubled the bet and wrote another book.
p111
aVAnd we bound that one, too.
p112
aVThat was a short time ago, at the end of last year.
p113
aVWhat I see week after week,
p114
aVis how they're turning into different people;
p115
aVhow they're being transformed.
p116
aVHow words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known,
p117
aVthat they couldn't even imagine.
p118
aVThey had no idea such dignity could come from them.
p119
aa(lp120
VAt the workshop, in that beloved hell we share, we all give something.
p121
aVWe open our hands and hearts and give what we have, what we can.
p122
aVAll of us; all of us equally.
p123
aVAnd so you feel that at least in a small way
p124
aVyou're repairing that huge social fracture
p125
aVwhich makes it so that for many of them,
p126
aVprison is their only destination.
p127
aVI remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet,
p128
aVfrom our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado:
p129
aV"I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."
p130
aa(lp131
VPoetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.
p132
aVIt opens doors.  Poetry works as a mirror.
p133
aVIt creates a mirror, which is the poem.
p134
aVThey recognize themselves, they look at themselves in the poem
p135
aVand write from who they are, and are from what they write.
p136
aa(lp137
VIn order to write,
p138
aVthey need to appropriate the moment of writing
p139
aVwhich is a moment of extraordinary freedom.
p140
aVThey have to get into their heads, search for that bit of freedom
p141
aVthat can never be taken away when they write
p142
aVand that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible
p143
aVeven inside a prison,
p144
aVand that the only bars we have in our wonderful space
p145
aVis the word "bars,"
p146
aVand that all of us in our hell burn with happiness
p147
aVwhen we light the wick of the word.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VI told you a lot about the prison, a lot about what I experience
p152
aVevery week, and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates.
p153
aVBut you don't know how much I'd like it
p154
aVif you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds,
p155
aVwhat I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am.
p156
aV(Applause)
p157
aVMartín Bustamante:  The heart chews tears of time;
p158
aVblinded by that light,
p159
aVit hides the speed of existence
p160
aVwhere the images go rowing by.
p161
aVIt fights; it hangs on.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe heart cracks under sad gazes,
p164
aVrides on storms that spread fire,
p165
aVlifts chests lowered by shame,
p166
aVknows that it's not just reading and going on,
p167
aVit also wishes to see the infinite blue.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe heart sits down to think about things,
p170
aVfights to avoid being ordinary,
p171
aVtries to love without hurting,
p172
aVbreathes the sun, giving courage to itself,
p173
aVsurrenders, travels toward reason.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe heart fights among the swamps,
p176
aVskirts the edge of the underworld,
p177
aVfalls exhausted, but won't give in to what's easy,
p178
aVwhile irregular steps of intoxication
p179
aVwake up,
p180
aVwake the stillness.

VI'm Martín Bustamante,
p183
aVI'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,
p184
aVtoday is my day of temporary release.
p185
aVAnd for me, poetry and literature have changed my life.
p186
