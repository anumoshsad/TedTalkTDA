VI do two things:
p4
aVI design mobile computers and I study brains.
p5
aVToday's talk is about brains and \u2014 (Audience member cheers)
p6
aVYay! I have a brain fan out there.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aVIf I could have my first slide,
p10
aVyou'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations.
p11
aVSo what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory,
p12
aVwhy it is important that we should develop one
p13
aVand what we can do about it.
p14
aVI'll try to do all that in 20 minutes.
p15
aVI have two affiliations.
p16
aVMost of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days,
p17
aVbut I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute
p18
aVcalled the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park.
p19
aVWe study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works.
p20
aVI'm going to talk all about that.
p21
aa(lp22
VI have one slide on my other life, the computer life,
p23
aVand that's this slide here.
p24
aVThese are some of the products I've worked on over the last 20 years,
p25
aVstarting from the very original laptop
p26
aVto some of the first tablet computers
p27
aVand so on, ending up most recently with the Treo,
p28
aVand we're continuing to do this.
p29
aVI've done this because I believe mobile computing
p30
aVis the future of personal computing,
p31
aVand I'm trying to make the world a little bit better
p32
aVby working on these things.
p33
aVBut this was, I admit, all an accident.
p34
aVI really didn't want to do any of these products.
p35
aVVery early in my career
p36
aVI decided I was not going to be in the computer industry.
p37
aa(lp38
VBefore that, I just have to tell you
p39
aVabout this picture of Graffiti I picked off the web the other day.
p40
aVI was looking for a picture for Graffiti that'll text input language.
p41
aVI found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script-writing things
p42
aVacross the top of their blackboard,
p43
aVand they had added Graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what happened was,
p48
aVwhen I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '79,
p49
aVI went to work for Intel and was in the computer industry,
p50
aVand three months into that, I fell in love with something else.
p51
aVI said, "I made the wrong career choice here,"
p52
aVand I fell in love with brains.
p53
aVThis is not a real brain.
p54
aVThis is a picture of one, a line drawing.
p55
aVAnd I don't remember exactly how it happened,
p56
aVbut I have one recollection, which was pretty strong in my mind.
p57
aVIn September of 1979,
p58
aVScientific American came out with a single-topic issue about the brain.
p59
aVIt was one of their best issues ever.
p60
aVThey talked about the neuron, development, disease, vision
p61
aVand all the things you might want to know about brains.
p62
aVIt was really quite impressive.
p63
aa(lp64
VOne might've had the impression we knew a lot about brains.
p65
aVBut the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame.
p66
aVToday is, I think, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA.
p67
aVAnd he wrote a story basically saying, this is all well and good,
p68
aVbut you know, we don't know diddly squat about brains,
p69
aVand no one has a clue how they work,
p70
aVso don't believe what anyone tells you.
p71
aVThis is a quote from that article, he says:
p72
aV"What is conspicuously lacking" \u2014 he's a very proper British gentleman \u2014
p73
aV"What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas
p74
aVin which to interpret these different approaches."
p75
aVI thought the word "framework" was great.
p76
aVHe didn't say we didn't have a theory.
p77
aVHe says we don't even know how to begin to think about it.
p78
aVWe don't even have a framework.
p79
aVWe are in the pre-paradigm days, if you want to use Thomas Kuhn.
p80
aVSo I fell in love with this.
p81
aVI said, look: We have all this knowledge about brains \u2014 how hard can it be?
p82
aVIt's something we can work on in my lifetime; I could make a difference.
p83
aVSo I tried to get out of the computer business, into the brain business.
p84
aa(lp85
VFirst, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there.
p86
aVI said, I want to build intelligent machines too,
p87
aVbut I want to study how brains work first.
p88
aVAnd they said, "Oh, you don't need to do that.
p89
aVYou're just going to program computers, that's all.
p90
aVI said, you really ought to study brains.
p91
aVThey said, "No, you're wrong."
p92
aVI said, "No, you're wrong," and I didn't get in.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VI was a little disappointed \u2014 pretty young \u2014
p97
aVbut I went back again a few years later,
p98
aVthis time in California, and I went to Berkeley.
p99
aVAnd I said, I'll go in from the biological side.
p100
aVSo I got in the PhD program in biophysics.
p101
aVI was like, I'm studying brains now. Well, I want to study theory.
p102
aVThey said, "You can't study theory about brains.
p103
aVYou can't get funded for that.
p104
aVAnd as a graduate student, you can't do that."
p105
aVSo I said, oh my gosh.
p106
aVI was depressed; I said, but I can make a difference in this field.
p107
aVI went back in the computer industry
p108
aVand said, I'll have to work here for a while.
p109
aVThat's when I designed all those computer products.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VI said, I want to do this for four years, make some money,
p114
aVI was having a family, and I would mature a bit,
p115
aVand maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit.
p116
aVWell, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years.
p117
aVBut I'm doing it now, and I'm going to tell you about it.
p118
aVSo why should we have a good brain theory?
p119
aVWell, there's lots of reasons people do science.
p120
aVThe most basic one is, people like to know things.
p121
aVWe're curious, and we go out and get knowledge.
p122
aVWhy do we study ants? It's interesting.
p123
aVMaybe we'll learn something useful, but it's interesting and fascinating.
p124
aVBut sometimes a science has other attributes
p125
aVwhich makes it really interesting.
p126
aa(lp127
VSometimes a science will tell something about ourselves;
p128
aVit'll tell us who we are.
p129
aVEvolution did this and Copernicus did this,
p130
aVwhere we have a new understanding of who we are.
p131
aVAnd after all, we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain.
p132
aVOur bodies are hanging along for the ride,
p133
aVbut my brain is talking to your brain.
p134
aVAnd if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive,
p135
aVwe need to understand brains.
p136
aVAnother thing is sometimes science leads to big societal benefits, technologies,
p137
aVor businesses or whatever.
p138
aVThis is one, too, because when we understand how brains work,
p139
aVwe'll be able to build intelligent machines.
p140
aVThat's a good thing on the whole,
p141
aVwith tremendous benefits to society,
p142
aVjust like a fundamental technology.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo why don't we have a good theory of brains?
p145
aVPeople have been working on it for 100 years.
p146
aVLet's first take a look at what normal science looks like.
p147
aVThis is normal science.
p148
aVNormal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists.
p149
aVThe theorist guy says, "I think this is what's going on,"
p150
aVthe experimentalist says, "You're wrong."
p151
aVIt goes back and forth, this works in physics, this in geology.
p152
aVBut if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like?
p153
aVThis is what neuroscience looks like.
p154
aVWe have this mountain of data,
p155
aVwhich is anatomy, physiology and behavior.
p156
aVYou can't imagine how much detail we know about brains.
p157
aVThere were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year,
p158
aVand every one of them is doing research in brains.
p159
aVA lot of data, but no theory.
p160
aVThere's a little wimpy box on top there.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way
p163
aVin the neurosciences.
p164
aVAnd it's a real shame.
p165
aVNow, why has this come about?
p166
aVIf you ask neuroscientists why is this the state of affairs,
p167
aVfirst, they'll admit it.
p168
aVBut if you ask them, they say,
p169
aVthere's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory.
p170
aVSome say we still don't have enough data,
p171
aVwe need more information, there's all these things we don't know.
p172
aVWell, I just told you there's data coming out of your ears.
p173
aVWe have so much information, we don't even know how to organize it.
p174
aVWhat good is more going to do?
p175
aVMaybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don't think so.
p176
aVThis is a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory.
p177
aVWe don't need more data, we need a good theory.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnother one is sometimes people say,
p180
aV"Brains are so complex, it'll take another 50 years."
p181
aVI even think Chris said something like this yesterday, something like,
p182
aVit's one of the most complicated things in the universe.
p183
aVThat's not true \u2014 you're more complicated than your brain.
p184
aVYou've got a brain.
p185
aVAnd although the brain looks very complicated,
p186
aVthings look complicated until you understand them.
p187
aVThat's always been the case.
p188
aVSo we can say, my neocortex, the part of the brain I'm interested in,
p189
aVhas 30 billion cells.
p190
aVBut, you know what? It's very, very regular.
p191
aVIn fact, it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over again.
p192
aVIt's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue.
p193
aa(lp194
VSome people say, brains can't understand brains.
p195
aVVery Zen-like. Woo.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VYou know, it sounds good, but why? I mean, what's the point?
p200
aVIt's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver.
p201
aVIt's got a lot of cells in it too, right?
p202
aVSo, you know, I don't think there's anything to that.
p203
aVAnd finally, some people say,
p204
aV"I don't feel like a bunch of cells \u2014 I'm conscious.
p205
aVI've got this experience, I'm in the world.
p206
aVI can't be just a bunch of cells."
p207
aVWell, people used to believe there was a life force to be living,
p208
aVand we now know that's really not true at all.
p209
aVAnd there's really no evidence,
p210
aVother than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do.
p211
aVSo some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism,
p212
aVsome really smart people, too, but we can reject all that.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VNo, there's something else,
p217
aVsomething really fundamental, and it is:
p218
aVanother reason why we don't have a good brain theory
p219
aVis because we have an intuitive, strongly held but incorrect assumption
p220
aVthat has prevented us from seeing the answer.
p221
aVThere's something we believe that just, it's obvious, but it's wrong.
p222
aVNow, there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is,
p223
aVI'll tell you about the history of it in science.
p224
aVLook at other scientific revolutions \u2014
p225
aVthe solar system, that's Copernicus,
p226
aVDarwin's evolution, and tectonic plates, that's Wegener.
p227
aVThey all have a lot in common with brain science.
p228
aa(lp229
VFirst, they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it.
p230
aVBut it got more manageable once they had a theory.
p231
aVThe best minds were stumped \u2014 really smart people.
p232
aVWe're not smarter now than they were then;
p233
aVit just turns out it's really hard to think of things,
p234
aVbut once you've thought of them, it's easy to understand.
p235
aVMy daughters understood these three theories,
p236
aVin their basic framework, in kindergarten.
p237
aVIt's not that hard \u2014 here's the apple, here's the orange,
p238
aVthe Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnother thing is the answer was there all along,
p241
aVbut we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing.
p242
aVIt was an intuitive, strongly held belief that was wrong.
p243
aVIn the case of the solar system,
p244
aVthe idea that the Earth is spinning,
p245
aVthe surface is going a thousand miles an hour,
p246
aVand it's going through the solar system at a million miles an hour \u2014
p247
aVthis is lunacy; we all know the Earth isn't moving.
p248
aVDo you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour?
p249
aVIf you said Earth was spinning around in space and was huge \u2014
p250
aVthey would lock you up, that's what they did back then.
p251
aVSo it was intuitive and obvious. Now, what about evolution?
p252
aa(lp253
VEvolution, same thing.
p254
aVWe taught our kids the Bible says God created all these species,
p255
aVcats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people; plants are plants;
p256
aVthey don't change.
p257
aVNoah put them on the ark in that order, blah, blah.
p258
aVThe fact is, if you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor.
p259
aVWe all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby!
p260
aVThis is what evolution tells us. And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable.
p261
aVAnd the same thing about tectonic plates.
p262
aVAll the mountains and the continents
p263
aVare kind of floating around on top of the Earth.
p264
aVIt doesn't make any sense.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what is the intuitive, but incorrect assumption,
p267
aVthat's kept us from understanding brains?
p268
aVI'll tell you. It'll seem obvious that it's correct. That's the point.
p269
aVThen I'll make an argument why you're incorrect on the other assumption.
p270
aVThe intuitive but obvious thing is:
p271
aVsomehow, intelligence is defined by behavior;
p272
aVwe're intelligent because of how we do things
p273
aVand how we behave intelligently.
p274
aVAnd I'm going to tell you that's wrong.
p275
aVIntelligence is defined by prediction.
p276
aa(lp277
VI'm going to work you through this in a few slides,
p278
aVand give you an example of what this means.
p279
aVHere's a system.
p280
aVEngineers and scientists like to look at systems like this.
p281
aVThey say, we have a thing in a box. We have its inputs and outputs.
p282
aVThe AI people said, the thing in the box is a programmable computer,
p283
aVbecause it's equivalent to a brain.
p284
aVWe'll feed it some inputs and get it to do something, have some behavior.
p285
aVAlan Turing defined the Turing test, which essentially says,
p286
aVwe'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human \u2014
p287
aVa behavioral metric of what intelligence is
p288
aVthat has stuck in our minds for a long time.
p289
aa(lp290
VReality, though \u2014 I call it real intelligence.
p291
aVReal intelligence is built on something else.
p292
aVWe experience the world through a sequence of patterns,
p293
aVand we store them, and we recall them.
p294
aVWhen we recall them, we match them up against reality,
p295
aVand we're making predictions all the time.
p296
aVIt's an internal metric; there's an internal metric about us,
p297
aVsaying, do we understand the world, am I making predictions, and so on.
p298
aVYou're all being intelligent now, but you're not doing anything.
p299
aVMaybe you're scratching yourself, but you're not doing anything.
p300
aVBut you're being intelligent; you're understanding what I'm saying.
p301
aVBecause you're intelligent and you speak English,
p302
aVyou know the word at the end of this
p303
aVsentence.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe word came to you; you make these predictions all the time.
p306
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p307
aVthe internal prediction is the output in the neocortex,
p308
aVand somehow, prediction leads to intelligent behavior.
p309
aVHere's how that happens:
p310
aVLet's start with a non-intelligent brain.
p311
aVI'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we'll call it an old brain.
p312
aVAnd we'll say it's a non-mammal, like a reptile,
p313
aVsay, an alligator; we have an alligator.
p314
aVAnd the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
p315
aVIt's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on,
p316
aVa mouth and a nose.
p317
aVIt has very complex behavior.
p318
aVIt can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you.
p319
aVIt can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
p320
aVBut we don't consider the alligator very intelligent,
p321
aVnot in a human sort of way.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut it has all this complex behavior already.
p324
aVNow in evolution, what happened?
p325
aVFirst thing that happened in evolution with mammals
p326
aVis we started to develop a thing called the neocortex.
p327
aVI'm going to represent the neocortex by this box on top of the old brain.
p328
aVNeocortex means "new layer." It's a new layer on top of your brain.
p329
aVIt's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head
p330
aVthat got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VLiterally, it's about the size of a table napkin
p335
aVand doesn't fit, so it's wrinkly.
p336
aVNow, look at how I've drawn this.
p337
aVThe old brain is still there.
p338
aVYou still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain.
p339
aVIt's all those gut reactions you have.
p340
aVOn top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex.
p341
aVAnd the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain.
p342
aVSo as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain,
p343
aVit also goes up into the neocortex.
p344
aVAnd the neocortex is just memorizing.
p345
aVIt's sitting there saying, I'm going to memorize all the things going on:
p346
aVwhere I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on.
p347
aVAnd in the future, when it sees something similar to that again,
p348
aVin a similar environment, or the exact same environment,
p349
aVit'll start playing it back: "Oh, I've been here before,"
p350
aVand when you were here before, this happened next.
p351
aVIt allows you to predict the future.
p352
aVIt literally feeds back the signals into your brain;
p353
aVthey'll let you see what's going to happen next,
p354
aVwill let you hear the word "sentence" before I said it.
p355
aVAnd it's this feeding back into the old brain
p356
aVthat will allow you to make more intelligent decisions.
p357
aa(lp358
VThis is the most important slide of my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little.
p359
aVAnd all the time you say, "Oh, I can predict things,"
p360
aVso if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze,
p361
aVnext time you're in one, you have the same behavior.
p362
aVBut suddenly, you're smarter; you say, "I recognize this maze,
p363
aVI know which way to go; I've been here before; I can envision the future."
p364
aVThat's what it's doing.
p365
aVThis is true for all mammals \u2014
p366
aVin humans, it got a lot worse.
p367
aVHumans actually developed the front of the neocortex,
p368
aVcalled the anterior part of the neocortex.
p369
aVAnd nature did a little trick.
p370
aVIt copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory,
p371
aVand put it in the front.
p372
aVHumans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front,
p373
aVbut we use it for motor control.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo we're now able to do very sophisticated motor planning, things like that.
p376
aVI don't have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works,
p377
aVyou have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works,
p378
aVhow it is we store patterns and make predictions.
p379
aVLet me give you a few examples of predictions.
p380
aVI already said the word "sentence."
p381
aVIn music, if you've heard a song before,
p382
aVwhen you hear it, the next note pops into your head already \u2014
p383
aVyou anticipate it.
p384
aVWith an album, at the end of a song, the next song pops into your head.
p385
aVIt happens all the time, you make predictions.
p386
aa(lp387
VI have this thing called the "altered door" thought experiment.
p388
aVIt says, you have a door at home;
p389
aVwhen you're here, I'm changing it \u2014
p390
aVI've got a guy back at your house right now, moving the door around,
p391
aVmoving your doorknob over two inches.
p392
aVWhen you go home tonight, you'll put your hand out, reach for the doorknob,
p393
aVnotice it's in the wrong spot
p394
aVand go, "Whoa, something happened."
p395
aVIt may take a second, but something happened.
p396
aVI can change your doorknob in other ways \u2014
p397
aVmake it larger, smaller, change its brass to silver, make it a lever,
p398
aVI can change the door; put colors on, put windows in.
p399
aVI can change a thousand things about your door
p400
aVand in the two seconds you take to open it,
p401
aVyou'll notice something has changed.
p402
aa(lp403
VNow, the engineering approach, the AI approach to this,
p404
aVis to build a door database with all the door attributes.
p405
aVAnd as you go up to the door, we check them off one at time:
p406
aVdoor, door, color ...
p407
aVWe don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that.
p408
aVYour brain is making constant predictions all the time
p409
aVabout what will happen in your environment.
p410
aVAs I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.
p411
aVWhen I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch,
p412
aVI'll know something has changed.
p413
aVYou're constantly making predictions about your environment.
p414
aVI'll talk about vision, briefly.
p415
aVThis is a picture of a woman.
p416
aVWhen we look at people, our eyes saccade over two to three times a second.
p417
aVWe're not aware of it, but our eyes are always moving.
p418
aVWhen we look at a face, we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth.
p419
aVWhen your eye moves from eye to eye,
p420
aVif there was something else there like a nose,
p421
aVyou'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go, "Oh, shit!"
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
V"There's something wrong about this person."
p426
aVThat's because you're making a prediction.
p427
aVIt's not like you just look over and say, "What am I seeing? A nose? OK."
p428
aVNo, you have an expectation of what you're going to see.
p429
aa(lp430
VEvery single moment.
p431
aVAnd finally, let's think about how we test intelligence.
p432
aVWe test it by prediction: What is the next word in this ...?
p433
aVThis is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence?
p434
aVHere's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one?
p435
aVThat's how we test it. It's all about prediction.
p436
aa(lp437
VSo what is the recipe for brain theory?
p438
aVFirst of all, we have to have the right framework.
p439
aVAnd the framework is a memory framework,
p440
aVnot a computational or behavior framework,
p441
aVit's a memory framework.
p442
aVHow do you store and recall these sequences of patterns?
p443
aVIt's spatiotemporal patterns.
p444
aa(lp445
VThen, if in that framework, you take a bunch of theoreticians \u2014
p446
aVbiologists generally are not good theoreticians.
p447
aVNot always, but generally, there's not a good history of theory in biology.
p448
aVI've found the best people to work with are physicists,
p449
aVengineers and mathematicians,
p450
aVwho tend to think algorithmically.
p451
aVThen they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology.
p452
aVYou have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms.
p453
aVAnyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works
p454
aVand doesn't tell you exactly how it's working
p455
aVand how the wiring works \u2014
p456
aVit's not a theory.
p457
aa(lp458
VAnd that's what we do at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute.
p459
aVI'd love to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing,
p460
aVand I expect to be back on this stage sometime in the not too distant future,
p461
aVto tell you about it.
p462
aVI'm really excited; this is not going to take 50 years.
p463
aa(lp464
VWhat will brain theory look like?
p465
aVFirst of all, it's going to be about memory.
p466
aVNot like computer memory \u2014 not at all like computer memory.
p467
aVIt's very different.
p468
aVIt's a memory of very high-dimensional patterns,
p469
aVlike the things that come from your eyes.
p470
aVIt's also memory of sequences:
p471
aVyou cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence.
p472
aVA song must be heard in sequence over time,
p473
aVand you must play it back in sequence over time.
p474
aVAnd these sequences are auto-associatively recalled,
p475
aVso if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it,
p476
aVand it plays back automatically.
p477
aVIt's an automatic playback.
p478
aVAnd prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
p479
aVAnd as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate,
p480
aVit must be testable and you must be able to build it.
p481
aVIf you don't build it, you don't understand it.
p482
aa(lp483
VOne more slide.
p484
aVWhat is this going to result in?
p485
aVAre we going to really build intelligent machines?
p486
aVAbsolutely. And it's going to be different than people think.
p487
aVNo doubt that it's going to happen, in my mind.
p488
aVFirst of all, we're going to build this stuff out of silicon.
p489
aVThe same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories,
p490
aVwe can use here.
p491
aVBut they're very different types of memories.
p492
aVAnd we'll attach these memories to sensors,
p493
aVand the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data,
p494
aVand learn about their environment.
p495
aa(lp496
VNow, it's very unlikely the first things you'll see are like robots.
p497
aVNot that robots aren't useful; people can build robots.
p498
aVBut the robotics part is the hardest part. That's old brain. That's really hard.
p499
aVThe new brain is easier than the old brain.
p500
aVSo first we'll do things that don't require a lot of robotics.
p501
aVSo you're not going to see C-3PO.
p502
aVYou're going to see things more like intelligent cars
p503
aVthat really understand what traffic is, what driving is
p504
aVand have learned that cars with the blinkers on for half a minute
p505
aVprobably aren't going to turn.
p506
aa(lp507
V(Laughter)
p508
aa(lp509
VWe can also do intelligent security systems.
p510
aVAnytime we're basically using our brain but not doing a lot of mechanics \u2014
p511
aVthose are the things that will happen first.
p512
aVBut ultimately, the world's the limit.
p513
aVI don't know how this will turn out.
p514
aVI know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor.
p515
aVAnd if you talk to them,
p516
aVthey knew what they were doing was really significant,
p517
aVbut they didn't really know what was going to happen.
p518
aVThey couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet
p519
aVand all this kind of stuff.
p520
aVThey just knew like, "We're going to build calculators
p521
aVand traffic-light controllers.
p522
aVBut it's going to be big!"
p523
aVIn the same way, brain science and these memories
p524
aVare going to be a very fundamental technology,
p525
aVand it will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years.
p526
aVAnd I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science.
p527
aVSo I think that's all my time \u2014 I'm over,
p528
aVand I'm going to end my talk right there.
