VLoneliness.
p4
aVAll of us in this room will experience loneliness
p5
aVat some point in our lives.
p6
aVLoneliness is not a function of being alone,
p7
aVbut rather, a function of how socially connected you are
p8
aVto those around you.
p9
aVThere could be somebody in this room right now
p10
aVsurrounded by a thousand people
p11
aVexperiencing loneliness.
p12
aVAnd while loneliness can be attributed to many things,
p13
aVas an architect,
p14
aVI'm going to tell you today how loneliness can be the result
p15
aVof our built environments \u2014
p16
aVthe very homes we choose to live in.
p17
aa(lp18
VLet's take a look at this house.
p19
aVIt's a nice house.
p20
aVThere's a big yard, picket fence,
p21
aVtwo-car garage.
p22
aVAnd the home might be in a neighborhood like this.
p23
aVAnd for many people around the globe,
p24
aVthis home, this neighborhood \u2014
p25
aVit's a dream.
p26
aVAnd yet the danger of achieving this dream
p27
aVis a false sense of connection
p28
aVand an increase in social isolation.
p29
aa(lp30
VI know, I can hear you now,
p31
aVthere's somebody in the room screaming at me inside their head,
p32
aV"That's my house, and that's my neighborhood,
p33
aVand I know everyone on my block!"
p34
aVTo which I would answer, "Terrific!"
p35
aVAnd I wish there were more people like you,
p36
aVbecause I'd wager to guess there's more people in the room
p37
aVliving in a similar situation
p38
aVthat might not know their neighbors.
p39
aVThey might recognize them and say hello,
p40
aVbut under their breath,
p41
aVthey're asking their spouse,
p42
aV"What was their name again?"
p43
aVso they can ask a question by name to signify they know them.
p44
aa(lp45
VSocial media also contributes to this false sense of connection.
p46
aVThis image is probably all too familiar.
p47
aVYou're standing in the elevator,
p48
aVsitting in a cafe,
p49
aVand you look around,
p50
aVand everyone's on their phone.
p51
aVYou're not texting or checking Facebook,
p52
aVbut everyone else is,
p53
aVand maybe, like me, you've been in a situation
p54
aVwhere you've made eye contact,
p55
aVsmiled and said hello,
p56
aVand have that person yank out their earbuds
p57
aVand say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?"
p58
aVI find this incredibly isolating.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe concept I'd like to share with you today
p61
aVis an antidote to isolation.
p62
aVIt's not a new concept.
p63
aVIn fact, it's an age-old way of living,
p64
aVand it still exists in many non-European cultures
p65
aVaround the world.
p66
aVAnd about 50 years ago,
p67
aVthe Danes decided to make up a new name,
p68
aVand since then,
p69
aVtens of thousands of Danish people have been living in this connected way.
p70
aVAnd it's being pursued more widely around the globe
p71
aVas people are seeking community.
p72
aVThis concept
p73
aVis cohousing.
p74
aa(lp75
VCohousing is an intentional neighborhood where people know each other
p76
aVand look after one another.
p77
aVIn cohousing, you have your own home,
p78
aVbut you also share significant spaces, both indoors and out.
p79
aVBefore I show you some pictures of cohousing,
p80
aVI'd like to first introduce you to my friends Sheila and Spencer.
p81
aVWhen I first met Sheila and Spencer, they were just entering their 60s,
p82
aVand Spencer was looking ahead at the end of a long career
p83
aVin elementary education.
p84
aVAnd he really disliked the idea
p85
aVthat he might not have children in his life
p86
aVupon retirement.
p87
aVThey're now my neighbors.
p88
aVWe live in a cohousing community that I not only designed,
p89
aVbut developed
p90
aVand have my architecture practice in.
p91
aVThis community is very intentional about our social interactions.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo let me take you on a tour.
p94
aVFrom the outside, we look like any other small apartment building.
p95
aVIn fact, we look identical to the one next door,
p96
aVexcept that we're bright yellow.
p97
aVInside, the homes are fairly conventional.
p98
aVWe all have living rooms and kitchens,
p99
aVbedrooms and baths,
p100
aVand there are nine of these homes around a central courtyard.
p101
aVThis one's mine,
p102
aVand this one is Spencer and Sheila's.
p103
aVThe thing that makes this building uniquely cohousing
p104
aVare not the homes,
p105
aVbut rather, what happens here \u2014
p106
aVthe social interactions that happen in and around that central courtyard.
p107
aVWhen I look across the courtyard,
p108
aVI look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.
p109
aVIn fact, every morning, this is what I see,
p110
aVSpencer waving at me furiously as we're making our breakfasts.
p111
aa(lp112
VFrom our homes, we look down into the courtyard,
p113
aVand depending on the time of year,
p114
aVwe see this:
p115
aVkids and grownups in various combinations
p116
aVplaying and hanging out with each other.
p117
aVThere's a lot of giggling and chatter.
p118
aVThere's a lot of hula-hooping.
p119
aVAnd every now and then, "Hey, quit hitting me!"
p120
aVor a cry from one of the kids.
p121
aVThese are the sounds of our daily lives,
p122
aVand the sounds of social connectedness.
p123
aVAt the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors,
p124
aVand those lead into the common house.
p125
aa(lp126
VI consider the common house the secret sauce of cohousing.
p127
aVIt's the secret sauce
p128
aVbecause it's the place where the social interactions
p129
aVand community life begin,
p130
aVand from there, it radiates out through the rest of the community.
p131
aVInside our common house, we have a large dining room
p132
aVto seat all 28 of us and our guests,
p133
aVand we dine together three times a week.
p134
aVIn support of those meals, we have a large kitchen
p135
aVso that we can take turns cooking for each other
p136
aVin teams of three.
p137
aVSo that means, with 17 adults,
p138
aVI lead cook once every six weeks.
p139
aVTwo other times, I show up and help my team
p140
aVwith the preparation and cleanup.
p141
aVAnd all those other nights,
p142
aVI just show up.
p143
aVI have dinner, talk with my neighbors,
p144
aVand I go home, having been fed a delicious meal
p145
aVby someone who cares about my vegetarian preferences.
p146
aa(lp147
VOur nine families have intentionally chosen
p148
aVan alternative way of living.
p149
aVInstead of pursuing the American dream,
p150
aVwhere we might have been isolated in our single-family homes,
p151
aVwe instead chose cohousing,
p152
aVso that we can increase our social connections.
p153
aVAnd that's how cohousing starts:
p154
aVwith a shared intention
p155
aVto live collaboratively.
p156
aVAnd intention is the single most important characteristic
p157
aVthat differentiates cohousing from any other housing model.
p158
aVAnd while intention is difficult to see
p159
aVor even show,
p160
aVI'm an architect, and I can't help but show you more pictures.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo here are a few examples to illustrate
p163
aVhow intention has been expressed
p164
aVin some of the communities I've visited.
p165
aVThrough the careful selection of furniture,
p166
aVlighting and acoustic materials to support eating together;
p167
aVin the careful visual location and visual access
p168
aVto kids' play areas around and inside the common house;
p169
aVin the consideration of scale
p170
aVand distribution of social gathering nodes
p171
aVin and around the community to support our daily lives,
p172
aVall of these spaces help contribute to and elevate
p173
aVthe sense of communitas
p174
aVin each community.
p175
aa(lp176
VWhat was that word? "Communitas."
p177
aVCommunitas is a fancy social science way of saying "spirit of community."
p178
aVAnd in visiting over 80 different communities,
p179
aVmy measure of communitas became:
p180
aVHow frequently did residents eat together?
p181
aVWhile it's completely up to each group
p182
aVhow frequently they have common meals,
p183
aVI know some that have eaten together every single night
p184
aVfor the past 40 years.
p185
aVI know others
p186
aVthat have an occasional potluck once or twice a month.
p187
aVAnd from my observations, I can tell you,
p188
aVthose that eat together more frequently,
p189
aVexhibit higher levels of communitas.
p190
aVIt turns out, when you eat together,
p191
aVyou start planning more activities together.
p192
aVWhen you eat together, you share more things.
p193
aVYou start to watch each other's kids.
p194
aVYou lend our your power tools. You borrow each other's cars.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd despite all this,
p197
aVas my daughter loves to say,
p198
aVeverything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing,
p199
aVand I'm not best friends with every single person in my community.
p200
aVWe even have differences and conflicts.
p201
aVBut living in cohousing, we're intentional about our relationships.
p202
aVWe're motivated to resolve our differences.
p203
aVWe follow up, we check in,
p204
aVwe speak our personal truths
p205
aVand, when appropriate,
p206
aVwe apologize.
p207
aa(lp208
VSkeptics will say that cohousing is only interesting or attractive
p209
aVto a very small group of people.
p210
aVAnd I'll agree with that.
p211
aVIf you look at Western cultures around the globe,
p212
aVthose living in cohousing are just a fractional percent.
p213
aVBut that needs to change,
p214
aVbecause our very lives depend upon it.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn 2015, Brigham Young University completed a study
p217
aVthat showed a significant increase risk of premature death
p218
aVin those who were living in isolation.
p219
aVThe US Surgeon General has declared isolation
p220
aVto be a public health epidemic.
p221
aVAnd this epidemic is not restricted to the US alone.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo when I said earlier
p224
aVthat cohousing is an antidote to isolation,
p225
aVwhat I should have said
p226
aVis that cohousing can save your life.
p227
aVIf I was a doctor, I would tell you to take two aspirin,
p228
aVand call me in the morning.
p229
aVBut as an architect,
p230
aVI'm going to suggest that you take a walk with your neighbor,
p231
aVshare a meal together,
p232
aVand call me in 20 years.
p233
aa(lp234
VThank you.
