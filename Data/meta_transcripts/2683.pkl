VWorldwide, over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict.
p4
aVIn response, people are forced to flee their country,
p5
aVleaving over 15 million refugees.
p6
aVChildren, without a doubt,
p7
aVare the most innocent and vulnerable victims ...
p8
aVbut not just from the obvious physical dangers,
p9
aVbut from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families.
p10
aVThe experiences of war leave children at a real high risk
p11
aVfor the development of emotional and behavioral problems.
p12
aVChildren, as we can only imagine,
p13
aVwill feel worried, threatened and at risk.
p14
aVBut there is good news.
p15
aVThe quality of care that children receive in their families
p16
aVcan have a more significant effect on their well-being
p17
aVthan from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to.
p18
aVSo actually, children can be protected
p19
aVby warm, secure parenting during and after conflict.
p20
aa(lp21
VIn 2011, I was a first-year PhD student
p22
aVin the University of Manchester School of Psychological Sciences.
p23
aVLike many of you here,
p24
aVI watched the crisis in Syria unfold in front of me on the TV.
p25
aVMy family is originally from Syria,
p26
aVand very early on,
p27
aVI lost several family members in really horrifying ways.
p28
aVI'd sit and I'd gather with my family and watch the TV.
p29
aVWe've all seen those scenes:
p30
aVbombs destroying buildings,
p31
aVchaos, destruction
p32
aVand people screaming and running.
p33
aVIt was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most,
p34
aVespecially those terrified-looking children.
p35
aVI was a mother to two young, typically inquisitive children.
p36
aVThey were five and six then,
p37
aVat an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions,
p38
aVand expected real, convincing answers.
p39
aVSo, I began to wonder what it might be like
p40
aVto parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp.
p41
aVWould my children change?
p42
aVWould my daughter's bright, happy eyes lose their shine?
p43
aVWould my son's really relaxed and carefree nature become fearful and withdrawn?
p44
aVHow would I cope?
p45
aVWould I change?
p46
aa(lp47
VAs psychologists and parent trainers,
p48
aVwe know that arming parents with skills in caring for their children
p49
aVcan have a huge effect on their well-being,
p50
aVand we call this parent training.
p51
aVThe question I had was,
p52
aVcould parent training programs be useful for families
p53
aVwhile they were still in war zones or refugee camps?
p54
aVCould we reach them with advice or training
p55
aVthat would help them through these struggles?
p56
aVSo I approached my PhD supervisor,
p57
aVProfessor Rachel Calam,
p58
aVwith the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world.
p59
aVI wasn't quite sure what exactly I wanted to do.
p60
aVShe listened carefully and patiently,
p61
aVand then to my joy she said,
p62
aV"If that's what you want to do, and it means so much to you,
p63
aVthen let's do it.
p64
aVLet's find ways to see if parent programs
p65
aVcan be useful for families in these contexts."
p66
aa(lp67
VSo for the past five years, myself and my colleagues \u2014
p68
aVProf. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright \u2014
p69
aVhave been working on ways to support families
p70
aVthat have experienced war and displacement.
p71
aVNow, to know how to help families that have been through conflict
p72
aVsupport their children,
p73
aVthe first step must obviously be to ask them what they're struggling with,
p74
aVright?
p75
aVI mean, it seems obvious.
p76
aVBut it's often those that are the most vulnerable,
p77
aVthat we're trying to support,
p78
aVthat we actually don't ask.
p79
aVHow many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing
p80
aVthat's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first?
p81
aa(lp82
VSo I travelled to refugee camps in Syria and in Turkey,
p83
aVand I sat with families, and I listened.
p84
aVI listened to their parenting challenges,
p85
aVI listened to their parenting struggles
p86
aVand I listened to their call for help.
p87
aVAnd sometimes that was just paused,
p88
aVas all I could do was hold hands with them
p89
aVand just join them in silent crying and prayer.
p90
aVThey told me about their struggles,
p91
aVthey told me about the rough, harsh refugee camp conditions
p92
aVthat made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores
p93
aVlike collecting clean water.
p94
aVThey told me how they watched their children withdraw;
p95
aVthe sadness, depression, anger,
p96
aVbed-wetting, thumb-sucking, fear of loud noises,
p97
aVfear of nightmares \u2014
p98
aVterrifying, terrifying nightmares.
p99
aVThese families had been through what we had been watching on the TV.
p100
aVThe mothers \u2014
p101
aValmost half of them were now widows of war,
p102
aVor didn't even know if their husbands were dead or alive \u2014
p103
aVdescribed how they felt they were coping so badly.
p104
aVThey watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them.
p105
aVThey didn't know how to answer their children's questions.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhat I found incredibly astonishing and so motivational
p108
aVwas that these families were so motivated to support their children.
p109
aVDespite all these challenges they faced,
p110
aVthey were trying to help their children.
p111
aVThey were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers,
p112
aVfrom refugee camp teachers,
p113
aVprofessional medics,
p114
aVother parents.
p115
aVOne mother I met had only been in a camp for four days,
p116
aVand had already made two attempts
p117
aVat seeking support for her eight-year-old daughter
p118
aVwho was having terrifying nightmares.
p119
aVBut sadly, these attempts are almost always useless.
p120
aVRefugee camp doctors, when available,
p121
aVare almost always too busy,
p122
aVor don't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports.
p123
aVRefugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them \u2014
p124
aVpart of a new refugee community who's struggling with new needs.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo then we began to think.
p127
aVHow could we help these families?
p128
aVThe families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with.
p129
aVThe Syrian crisis made it clear
p130
aVhow incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level.
p131
aVHow else could we help them?
p132
aVHow would we reach families at a population level
p133
aVand low costs
p134
aVin these terrifying, terrifying times?
p135
aa(lp136
VAfter hours of speaking to NGO workers,
p137
aVone suggested a fantastic innovative idea
p138
aVof distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers \u2014
p139
aVbread wrappers that were being delivered to families in a conflict zone in Syria
p140
aVby humanitarian workers.
p141
aVSo that's what we did.
p142
aVThe bread wrappers haven't changed at all in their appearance,
p143
aVexcept for the addition of two pieces of paper.
p144
aVOne was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information
p145
aVthat normalized to the parent what they might be experiencing,
p146
aVand what their child might be experiencing.
p147
aVAnd information on how they could support themselves and their children,
p148
aVsuch as information like spending time talking to your child,
p149
aVshowing them more affection,
p150
aVbeing more patient with your child,
p151
aVtalking to your children.
p152
aVThe other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire,
p153
aVand of course, there was a pen.
p154
aVSo is this simply leaflet distribution,
p155
aVor is this actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid
p156
aVthat provides warm, secure, loving parenting?
p157
aa(lp158
VWe managed to distribute 3,000 of these in just one week.
p159
aVWhat was incredible was we had a 60 percent response rate.
p160
aV60 percent of the 3,000 families responded.
p161
aVI don't know how many researchers we have here today,
p162
aVbut that kind of response rate is fantastic.
p163
aVTo have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement,
p164
aVlet alone in a conflict zone in Syria \u2014
p165
aVreally highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families.
p166
aVI remember how excited and eager we were for the return of the questionnaires.
p167
aVThe families had left hundreds of messages \u2014
p168
aVmost incredibly positive and encouraging.
p169
aVBut my favorite has got to be,
p170
aV"Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children."
p171
aVThis really illustrates the potential means
p172
aVof the delivery of psychological first aid to families,
p173
aVand the return of feedback, too.
p174
aVJust imagine replicating this using other means
p175
aVsuch as baby milk distribution, or female hygiene kits,
p176
aVor even food baskets.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut let's bring this closer to home,
p179
aVbecause the refugee crisis
p180
aVis one that is having an effect on every single one of us.
p181
aVWe're bombarded with images daily of statistics and of photos,
p182
aVand that's not surprising,
p183
aVbecause by last month,
p184
aVover one million refugees had reached Europe.
p185
aVOne million.
p186
aVRefugees are joining our communities,
p187
aVthey're becoming our neighbors,
p188
aVtheir children are attending our children's schools.
p189
aVSo we've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of European refugees,
p190
aVand we have them online, open-access,
p191
aVin areas with a really high refugee influx.
p192
aVFor example, the Swedish healthcare uploaded it onto their website,
p193
aVand within the first 45 minutes,
p194
aVit was downloaded 343 times \u2014
p195
aVreally highlighting how important it is
p196
aVfor volunteers, practitioners and other parents
p197
aVto have open-access, psychological first-aid messages.
p198
aa(lp199
VIn 2013, I was sitting on the cold, hard floor of a refugee camp tent
p200
aVwith mothers sitting around me as I was conducting a focus group.
p201
aVAcross from me stood an elderly lady
p202
aVwith what seemed to be a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,
p203
aVwith her head on the elderly lady's knees.
p204
aVThe girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group,
p205
aVnot talking at all,
p206
aVwith her knees curled up against her chest.
p207
aVTowards the end of the focus group,
p208
aVand as I was thanking the mothers for their time,
p209
aVthe elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl,
p210
aVand said to me, "Can you help us with...?"
p211
aVNot quite sure what she expected me to do,
p212
aVI looked at the young girl and smiled,
p213
aVand in Arabic I said,
p214
aV"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"
p215
aV"What's your name?"
p216
aVShe looked at me really confused and unengaged,
p217
aVbut then said, "Halul."
p218
aVHalul is the pet's name for the Arabic female name, Hala,
p219
aVand is only really used to refer to really young girls.
p220
aVAt that point I realized that actually Hala was probably much older than 13.
p221
aVIt turns out Hala was a 25-year-old mother to three young children.
p222
aVHala had been a confident, bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother
p223
aVto her children,
p224
aVbut the war had changed all of that.
p225
aVShe had lived through bombs being dropped in her town;
p226
aVshe had lived through explosions.
p227
aVWhen fighter jets were flying around their building,
p228
aVdropping bombs,
p229
aVher children would be screaming, terrified from the noise.
p230
aVHala would frantically grab pillows and cover her children's ears
p231
aVto block out the noise,
p232
aVall the while screaming herself.
p233
aVWhen they reached the refugee camp
p234
aVand she knew they were finally in some kind of safety,
p235
aVshe completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self.
p236
aVShe completely rejected her family \u2014
p237
aVher children, her husband.
p238
aVHala simply could no longer cope.
p239
aa(lp240
VThis is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending,
p241
aVbut sadly, it's not uncommon.
p242
aVThose who experience armed conflict and displacement
p243
aVwill face serious emotional struggles.
p244
aVAnd that's something we can all relate to.
p245
aVIf you have been through a devastating time in your life,
p246
aVif you have lost someone or something you really care about,
p247
aVhow would you continue to cope?
p248
aVCould you still be able to care for yourself and for your family?
p249
aa(lp250
VGiven that the first years of a child's life are crucial
p251
aVfor healthy physical and emotional development,
p252
aVand that 1.5 billion people are experiencing armed conflict \u2014
p253
aVmany of whom are now joining our communities \u2014
p254
aVwe cannot afford to turn a blind eye
p255
aVto the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement.
p256
aVWe must prioritize these families' needs \u2014
p257
aVboth those who are internally displaced, and those who are refugees worldwide.
p258
aVThese needs must be prioritized by NGO workers, policy makers,
p259
aVthe WHO, the UNHCR and every single one of us
p260
aVin whatever capacity it is that we function in our society.
p261
aa(lp262
VWhen we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict,
p263
aVwhen we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces,
p264
aVwe begin to see them as humans, too.
p265
aVWe begin to see the needs of these families,
p266
aVand these are the real human needs.
p267
aVWhen these family needs are prioritized,
p268
aVinterventions for children in humanitarian settings
p269
aVwill prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children.
p270
aVFamily mental health will be shouting loud and clear
p271
aVin global, international agenda.
p272
aVAnd children will be less likely to enter social service systems
p273
aVin resettlement countries
p274
aVbecause their families would have had support earlier on.
p275
aVAnd we will be more open-minded,
p276
aVmore welcoming, more caring
p277
aVand more trusting to those who are joining our communities.
p278
aa(lp279
VWe need to stop wars.
p280
aVWe need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts,
p281
aVand not bombs.
p282
aVUntil we stop armed conflicts raging throughout the world,
p283
aVfamilies will continue to be displaced,
p284
aVleaving children vulnerable.
p285
aVBut by improving parenting and caregiver support,
p286
aVit may be possible to weaken the links between war and psychological difficulties
p287
aVin children and their families.
