VSo historically there has
p4
aVbeen a huge divide between what people
p5
aVconsider to be non-living systems on one
p6
aVside, and living systems on the other side.
p7
aVSo we go from, say, this beautiful and
p8
aVcomplex crystal as non-life, and this rather
p9
aVbeautiful and complex cat on the other side.
p10
aVOver the last hundred and fifty years or so,
p11
aVscience has kind of blurred this distinction
p12
aVbetween non-living and living systems, and
p13
aVnow we consider that there may be a kind
p14
aVof continuum that exists between the two.
p15
aVWe'll just take one example here:
p16
aVa virus is a natural system, right?
p17
aVBut it's very simple. It's very simplistic.
p18
aVIt doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,
p19
aVit doesn't have all the characteristics
p20
aVof living systems and is in fact a parasite
p21
aVon other living systems in order to, say,
p22
aVreproduce and evolve.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut what we're going to be talking about here
p25
aVtonight are experiments done on this sort of
p26
aVnon-living end of this spectrum \u2014 so actually
p27
aVdoing chemical experiments in the laboratory,
p28
aVmixing together nonliving ingredients
p29
aVto make new structures, and that these
p30
aVnew structures might have some of the
p31
aVcharacteristics of living systems.
p32
aVReally what I'm talking about here is
p33
aVtrying to create a kind of artificial life.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo what are these characteristics that I'm
p36
aVtalking about? These are them.
p37
aVWe consider first that life has a body.
p38
aVNow this is necessary to distinguish the self
p39
aVfrom the environment.
p40
aVLife also has a metabolism. Now this is a
p41
aVprocess by which life can convert resources
p42
aVfrom the environment into building blocks
p43
aVso it can maintain and build itself.
p44
aVLife also has a kind of inheritable information.
p45
aVNow we, as humans, we store our information
p46
aVas DNA in our genomes and we pass this
p47
aVinformation on to our offspring.
p48
aVIf we couple the first two \u2014 the body and the metabolism \u2014
p49
aVwe can come up with a system that could
p50
aVperhaps move and replicate, and if we
p51
aVcoupled these now to inheritable information,
p52
aVwe can come up with a system that would be
p53
aVmore lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.
p54
aVAnd so these are the things we will try to do
p55
aVin the lab, make some experiments that have
p56
aVone or more of these characteristics of life.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo how do we do this? Well, we use
p59
aVa model system that we term a protocell.
p60
aVYou might think of this as kind of like a
p61
aVprimitive cell. It is a simple chemical
p62
aVmodel of a living cell, and if you consider
p63
aVfor example a cell in your body may have
p64
aVon the order of millions of different types
p65
aVof molecules that need to come together,
p66
aVplay together in a complex network
p67
aVto produce something that we call alive.
p68
aVIn the laboratory what we want to do
p69
aVis much the same, but with on the order of
p70
aVtens of different types of molecules \u2014
p71
aVso a drastic reduction in complexity, but still
p72
aVtrying to produce something that looks lifelike.
p73
aVAnd so what we do is, we start simple
p74
aVand we work our way up to living systems.
p75
aVConsider for a moment this quote by
p76
aVLeduc, a hundred years ago, considering a
p77
aVkind of synthetic biology:
p78
aV"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,
p79
aVwill not be the sensational discovery which we
p80
aVusually associate with the idea."
p81
aVThat's his first statement. So if we actually
p82
aVcreate life in the laboratories, it's
p83
aVprobably not going to impact our lives at all.
p84
aa(lp85
V"If we accept the theory of evolution, then
p86
aVthe first dawn of synthesis of life must consist
p87
aVin the production of forms intermediate
p88
aVbetween the inorganic and the organic
p89
aVworld, or between the non-living
p90
aVand living world, forms which possess
p91
aVonly some of the rudimentary attributes of life"
p92
aV\u2014 so, the ones I just discussed \u2014
p93
aV"to which other attributes will be slowly added
p94
aVin the course of development by the
p95
aVevolutionary actions of the environment."
p96
aVSo we start simple, we make some structures
p97
aVthat may have some of these characteristics
p98
aVof life, and then we try to develop that
p99
aVto become more lifelike.
p100
aVThis is how we can start to make a protocell.
p101
aVWe use this idea called self-assembly.
p102
aVWhat that means is, I can mix some
p103
aVchemicals together in a test tube in my lab,
p104
aVand these chemicals will start to self-associate
p105
aVto form larger and larger structures.
p106
aVSo say on the order of tens of thousands,
p107
aVhundreds of thousands of molecules will
p108
aVcome together to form a large structure
p109
aVthat didn't exist before.
p110
aVAnd in this particular example,
p111
aVwhat I took is some membrane molecules,
p112
aVmixed those together in the right environment,
p113
aVand within seconds it forms these rather
p114
aVcomplex and beautiful structures here.
p115
aVThese membranes are also quite similar,
p116
aVmorphologically and functionally,
p117
aVto the membranes in your body,
p118
aVand we can use these, as they say,
p119
aVto form the body of our protocell.
p120
aa(lp121
VLikewise,
p122
aVwe can work with oil and water systems.
p123
aVAs you know, when you put oil and water together,
p124
aVthey don't mix, but through self-assembly
p125
aVwe can get a nice oil droplet to form,
p126
aVand we can actually use this as a body for
p127
aVour artificial organism or for our protocell,
p128
aVas you will see later.
p129
aVSo that's just forming some body stuff, right?
p130
aVSome architectures.
p131
aVWhat about the other aspects of living systems?
p132
aVSo we came up with this protocell model here
p133
aVthat I'm showing.
p134
aVWe started with a natural occurring clay
p135
aVcalled montmorillonite.
p136
aVThis is natural from the environment, this clay.
p137
aVIt forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.
p138
aVIt could run a metabolism on it.
p139
aVCertain kind of molecules like to associate
p140
aVwith the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red
p141
aV\u2014 this is a relative of DNA,
p142
aVit's an informational molecule \u2014
p143
aVit can come along and it starts to associate
p144
aVwith the surface of this clay.
p145
aVThis structure, then, can organize the
p146
aVformation of a membrane boundary around
p147
aVitself, so it can make a body of
p148
aVliquid molecules around itself, and that's
p149
aVshown in green here on this micrograph.
p150
aVSo just through self-assembly, mixing things
p151
aVtogether in the lab, we can come up with, say,
p152
aVa metabolic surface with some
p153
aVinformational molecules attached
p154
aVinside of this membrane body, right?
p155
aa(lp156
VSo we're on a road towards living systems.
p157
aVBut if you saw this protocell, you would not
p158
aVconfuse this with something that was actually alive.
p159
aVIt's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,
p160
aVit doesn't really do anything.
p161
aVSo, something is missing.
p162
aVSome things are missing.
p163
aVSo some things that are missing is,
p164
aVfor example, if you had a flow of energy
p165
aVthrough a system, what we'd want
p166
aVis a protocell that can harvest
p167
aVsome of that energy in order to maintain itself,
p168
aVmuch like living systems do.
p169
aVSo we came up with a different protocell
p170
aVmodel, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.
p171
aVIn this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,
p172
aVbut a chemical metabolism inside
p173
aVthat allows this protocell to use energy
p174
aVto do something, to actually become dynamic,
p175
aVas we'll see here.
p176
aVYou add the droplet to the system.
p177
aVIt's a pool of water, and the protocell
p178
aVstarts moving itself around in the system.
p179
aVOkay? Oil droplet forms
p180
aVthrough self-assembly, has a chemical
p181
aVmetabolism inside so it can use energy,
p182
aVand it uses that energy to move itself
p183
aVaround in its environment.
p184
aa(lp185
VAs we heard earlier, movement is very
p186
aVimportant in these kinds of living systems.
p187
aVIt is moving around, exploring its environment,
p188
aVand remodeling its environment, as you see,
p189
aVby these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
p190
aVSo it's acting, in a sense, like a living system
p191
aVtrying to preserve itself.
p192
aVWe take this same moving protocell here,
p193
aVand we put it in another experiment,
p194
aVget it moving. Then I'm going
p195
aVto add some food to the system,
p196
aVand you'll see that in blue here, right?
p197
aVSo I add some food source to the system.
p198
aVThe protocell moves. It encounters the food.
p199
aVIt reconfigures itself and actually then
p200
aVis able to climb to the highest concentration
p201
aVof food in that system and stop there.
p202
aVAlright? So not only do we have this system
p203
aVthat has a body, it has a metabolism,
p204
aVit can use energy, it moves around.
p205
aVIt can sense its local environment
p206
aVand actually find resources
p207
aVin the environment to sustain itself.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have
p210
aVa neural system. This is just a sack of
p211
aVchemicals that is able to have this interesting
p212
aVand complex lifelike behavior.
p213
aVIf we count the number of chemicals
p214
aVin that system, actually, including the water
p215
aVthat's in the dish, we have five chemicals
p216
aVthat can do this.
p217
aVSo then we put these protocells together in a
p218
aVsingle experiment to see what they would do,
p219
aVand depending on the conditions, we have
p220
aVsome protocells on the left that are
p221
aVmoving around and it likes to touch the other
p222
aVstructures in its environment.
p223
aVOn the other hand we have two moving
p224
aVprotocells that like to circle each other,
p225
aVand they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.
p226
aVRight? So not only do individual protocells
p227
aVhave behavior, what we've interpreted as
p228
aVbehavior in this system, but we also have
p229
aVbasically population-level behavior
p230
aVsimilar to what organisms have.
p231
aVSo now that you're all experts on protocells,
p232
aVwe're going to play a game with these protocells.
p233
aVWe're going to make two different kinds.
p234
aVProtocell A has a certain kind of chemistry
p235
aVinside that, when activated, the protocell
p236
aVstarts to vibrate around, just dancing.
p237
aVSo remember, these are primitive things,
p238
aVso dancing protocells, that's very
p239
aVinteresting to us. (Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VThe second protocell has a different
p242
aVchemistry inside, and when activated,
p243
aVthe protocells all come together and they fuse
p244
aVinto one big one. Right?
p245
aVAnd we just put these two together
p246
aVin the same system.
p247
aVSo there's population A,
p248
aVthere's population B, and then
p249
aVwe activate the system,
p250
aVand protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,
p251
aVthey all come together. They fuse together
p252
aVto form one big blob, and the other protocell
p253
aVjust dances around. And this just happens
p254
aVuntil all of the energy in the system is
p255
aVbasically used up, and then, game over.
p256
aVSo then I repeated this experiment
p257
aVa bunch of times, and one time
p258
aVsomething very interesting happened.
p259
aVSo, I added these protocells together
p260
aVto the system, and protocell A and protocell B
p261
aVfused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.
p262
aVThat didn't happen before. There it goes.
p263
aVThere's a protocell AB now in this system.
p264
aVProtocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,
p265
aVwhile protocell B does the fusing, okay?
p266
aa(lp267
VBut then something even more interesting happens.
p268
aVWatch when these two large protocells,
p269
aVthe hybrid ones, fuse together.
p270
aVNow we have a dancing protocell
p271
aVand a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)
p272
aVJust with blobs of chemicals, again.
p273
aVSo the way this works is, you have
p274
aVa simple system of five chemicals here,
p275
aVa simple system here. When they hybridize,
p276
aVyou then form something that's different than
p277
aVbefore, it's more complex than before,
p278
aVand you get the emergence of another kind of
p279
aVlifelike behavior which
p280
aVin this case is replication.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo since we can make some interesting
p283
aVprotocells that we like, interesting colors and
p284
aVinteresting behaviors, and they're very easy
p285
aVto make, and they have interesting lifelike
p286
aVproperties, perhaps these protocells have
p287
aVsomething to tell us about the origin of life
p288
aVon the Earth. Perhaps these represent an
p289
aVeasily accessible step, one of the first steps
p290
aVby which life got started on the early Earth.
p291
aVCertainly, there were molecules present on
p292
aVthe early Earth, but they wouldn't have been
p293
aVthese pure compounds that we worked with
p294
aVin the lab and I showed in these experiments.
p295
aVRather, they'd be a real complex mixture of
p296
aVall kinds of stuff, because
p297
aVuncontrolled chemical reactions produce
p298
aVa diverse mixture of organic compounds.
p299
aVThink of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
p300
aVAnd it's a pool that's too difficult to fully
p301
aVcharacterize, even by modern methods, and
p302
aVthe product looks brown, like this tar here
p303
aVon the left. A pure compound
p304
aVis shown on the right, for contrast.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo this is similar to what happens when you
p307
aVtake pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,
p308
aVyou put them in a pan, and you apply energy.
p309
aVYou turn up the heat, you start making
p310
aVor breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,
p311
aVforming a brownish caramel, right?
p312
aVIf you let that go unregulated, you'll
p313
aVcontinue to make and break chemical bonds,
p314
aVforming an even more diverse mixture of
p315
aVmolecules that then forms this kind of black
p316
aVtarry stuff in your pan, right, that's
p317
aVdifficult to wash out. So that's what
p318
aVthe origin of life would have looked like.
p319
aVYou needed to get life out of this junk that
p320
aVis present on the early Earth,
p321
aVfour, 4.5 billion years ago.
p322
aVSo the challenge then is,
p323
aVthrow away all your pure chemicals in the lab,
p324
aVand try to make some protocells with lifelike
p325
aVproperties from this kind of primordial ooze.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo we're able to then see the self-assembly
p328
aVof these oil droplet bodies again
p329
aVthat we've seen previously,
p330
aVand the black spots inside of there
p331
aVrepresent this kind of black tar \u2014 this diverse,
p332
aVvery complex, organic black tar.
p333
aVAnd we put them into one of these
p334
aVexperiments, as you've seen earlier, and then
p335
aVwe watch lively movement that comes out.
p336
aVThey look really good, very nice movement,
p337
aVand also they appear to have some kind of
p338
aVbehavior where they kind of circle
p339
aVaround each other and follow each other,
p340
aVsimilar to what we've seen before \u2014 but again,
p341
aVworking with just primordial conditions,
p342
aVno pure chemicals.
p343
aVThese are also, these tar-fueled protocells,
p344
aVare also able to locate resources
p345
aVin their environment.
p346
aVI'm going to add some resource from the left,
p347
aVhere, that defuses into the system,
p348
aVand you can see, they really like that.
p349
aVThey become very energetic, and able
p350
aVto find the resource in the environment,
p351
aVsimilar to what we saw before.
p352
aVBut again, these are done in these primordial
p353
aVconditions, really messy conditions,
p354
aVnot sort of sterile laboratory conditions.
p355
aVThese are very dirty little protocells,
p356
aVas a matter of fact. (Laughter)
p357
aVBut they have lifelike properties, is the point.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo, doing these artificial life experiments
p360
aVhelps us define a potential path between
p361
aVnon-living and living systems.
p362
aVAnd not only that, but it helps us
p363
aVbroaden our view of what life is
p364
aVand what possible life there could be
p365
aVout there \u2014 life that could be very different
p366
aVfrom life that we find here on Earth.
p367
aVAnd that leads me to the next
p368
aVterm, which is "weird life."
p369
aVThis is a term by Steve Benner.
p370
aVThis is used in reference to a report
p371
aVin 2007 by the National Research Council
p372
aVin the United States, wherein
p373
aVthey tried to understand how we can
p374
aVlook for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,
p375
aVespecially if that life is very different from life
p376
aVon Earth. If we went to another planet and
p377
aVwe thought there might be life there,
p378
aVhow could we even recognize it as life?
p379
aa(lp380
VWell, they came up with three very general
p381
aVcriteria. First is \u2014 and they're listed here.
p382
aVThe first is, the system has to be in
p383
aVnon-equilibrium. That means the system
p384
aVcannot be dead, in a matter of fact.
p385
aVBasically what that means is, you have
p386
aVan input of energy into the system that life
p387
aVcan use and exploit to maintain itself.
p388
aVThis is similar to having the Sun shining
p389
aVon the Earth, driving photosynthesis,
p390
aVdriving the ecosystem.
p391
aVWithout the Sun, there's likely to be
p392
aVno life on this planet.
p393
aVSecondly, life needs to be in liquid form,
p394
aVso that means even if we had some
p395
aVinteresting structures, interesting molecules
p396
aVtogether but they were frozen solid,
p397
aVthen this is not a good place for life.
p398
aVAnd thirdly, we need to be able to make
p399
aVand break chemical bonds. And again
p400
aVthis is important because life transforms
p401
aVresources from the environment into
p402
aVbuilding blocks so it can maintain itself.
p403
aa(lp404
VNow today, I told you about very strange
p405
aVand weird protocells \u2014 some that contain clay,
p406
aVsome that have primordial ooze in them,
p407
aVsome that have basically oil
p408
aVinstead of water inside of them.
p409
aVMost of these don't contain DNA,
p410
aVbut yet they have lifelike properties.
p411
aVBut these protocells satisfy
p412
aVthese general requirements of living systems.
p413
aVSo by making these chemical, artificial
p414
aVlife experiments, we hope not only
p415
aVto understand something fundamental
p416
aVabout the origin of life and the existence
p417
aVof life on this planet, but also
p418
aVwhat possible life there could be
p419
aVout there in the universe. Thank you.
