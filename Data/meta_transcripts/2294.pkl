VMy colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots.
p4
aVSo what are these dots?
p5
aVWell, it's all of us.
p6
aVAnd we're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and travel
p7
aVthroughout our cities and around the world.
p8
aVAnd wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement?
p9
aVIf we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it.
p10
aVAnd luckily for us, we live in a time
p11
aVwhere we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves.
p12
aVSo whether it's through sensors or videos, or apps,
p13
aVwe can track our movement with incredibly fine detail.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement
p16
aVis sports.
p17
aVSo whether it's basketball or baseball, or football or the other football,
p18
aVwe're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements
p19
aVevery fraction of a second.
p20
aVSo what we're doing is turning our athletes into \u2014
p21
aVyou probably guessed it \u2014
p22
aVmoving dots.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data,
p25
aVit's hard to deal with and not that interesting.
p26
aVBut there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know.
p27
aVAnd the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second
p28
aVof every game, remember it and process it.
p29
aVAnd a person can't do that,
p30
aVbut a machine can.
p31
aVThe problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach.
p32
aVAt least they couldn't until now.
p33
aVSo what have we taught the machine to see?
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, we started simply.
p36
aVWe taught it things like passes, shots and rebounds.
p37
aVThings that most casual fans would know.
p38
aVAnd then we moved on to things slightly more complicated.
p39
aVEvents like post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.
p40
aVAnd if you don't know them, that's okay. Most casual players probably do.
p41
aVNow, we've gotten to a point where today, the machine understands complex events
p42
aVlike down screens and wide pins.
p43
aVBasically things only professionals know.
p44
aVSo we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo how have we been able to do this?
p47
aVIf I asked a coach to describe something like a pick-and-roll,
p48
aVthey would give me a description,
p49
aVand if I encoded that as an algorithm, it would be terrible.
p50
aVThe pick-and-roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players,
p51
aVtwo on offense and two on defense.
p52
aVAnd here's kind of how it goes.
p53
aVSo there's the guy on offense without the ball
p54
aVthe ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball,
p55
aVand he kind of stays there
p56
aVand they both move and stuff happens, and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo that is also an example of a terrible algorithm.
p61
aVSo, if the player who's the interferer \u2014 he's called the screener \u2014
p62
aVgoes close by, but he doesn't stop,
p63
aVit's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p64
aVOr if he does stop, but he doesn't stop close enough,
p65
aVit's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p66
aVOr, if he does go close by and he does stop
p67
aVbut they do it under the basket, it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
p68
aVOr I could be wrong, they could all be pick-and-rolls.
p69
aVIt really depends on the exact timing, the distances, the locations,
p70
aVand that's what makes it hard.
p71
aVSo, luckily, with machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability
p72
aVto describe the things we know.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo how does this work? Well, it's by example.
p75
aVSo we go to the machine and say, "Good morning, machine.
p76
aVHere are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not.
p77
aVPlease find a way to tell the difference."
p78
aVAnd the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate.
p79
aVSo if I was going to teach it the difference
p80
aVbetween an apple and orange,
p81
aVI might say, "Why don't you use color or shape?"
p82
aVAnd the problem that we're solving is, what are those things?
p83
aVWhat are the key features
p84
aVthat let a computer navigate the world of moving dots?
p85
aVSo figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location,
p86
aVdistance, timing, velocities \u2014
p87
aVthat's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it,
p88
aVspatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular.
p89
aVBecause the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard \u2014
p90
aVbecause it is.
p91
aa(lp92
VThe key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know
p93
aVwhether a pick-and-roll happened or not.
p94
aVIt's that they want to know how it happened.
p95
aVAnd why is it so important to them? So here's a little insight.
p96
aVIt turns out in modern basketball,
p97
aVthis pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play.
p98
aVAnd knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it,
p99
aVis basically a key to winning and losing most games.
p100
aVSo it turns out that this dance has a great many variations
p101
aVand identifying the variations is really the thing that matters,
p102
aVand that's why we need this to be really, really good.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, here's an example.
p105
aVThere are two offensive and two defensive players,
p106
aVgetting ready to do the pick-and-roll dance.
p107
aVSo the guy with ball can either take, or he can reject.
p108
aVHis teammate can either roll or pop.
p109
aVThe guy guarding the ball can either go over or under.
p110
aVHis teammate can either show or play up to touch, or play soft
p111
aVand together they can either switch or blitz
p112
aVand I didn't know most of these things when I started
p113
aVand it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows.
p114
aVIt would make our lives a lot easier, but it turns out movement is very messy.
p115
aVPeople wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified
p116
aVwith very high accuracy,
p117
aVboth in precision and recall, is tough
p118
aVbecause that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you.
p119
aVAnd despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features
p120
aVwe have been able to do that.
p121
aa(lp122
VCoaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations.
p123
aVWe're at the point where almost every single contender
p124
aVfor an NBA championship this year
p125
aVis using our software, which is built on a machine that understands
p126
aVthe moving dots of basketball.
p127
aVSo not only that, we have given advice that has changed strategies
p128
aVthat have helped teams win very important games,
p129
aVand it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league
p130
aVfor 30 years that are willing to take advice from a machine.
p131
aVAnd it's very exciting, it's much more than the pick-and-roll.
p132
aVOur computer started out with simple things
p133
aVand learned more and more complex things
p134
aVand now it knows so many things.
p135
aVFrankly, I don't understand much of what it does,
p136
aVand while it's not that special to be smarter than me,
p137
aVwe were wondering, can a machine know more than a coach?
p138
aVCan it know more than person could know?
p139
aVAnd it turns out the answer is yes.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe coaches want players to take good shots.
p142
aVSo if I'm standing near the basket
p143
aVand there's nobody near me, it's a good shot.
p144
aVIf I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.
p145
aVBut we never knew how good "good" was, or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.
p146
aVUntil now.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo what we can do, again, using spatiotemporal features,
p149
aVwe looked at every shot.
p150
aVWe can see: Where is the shot? What's the angle to the basket?
p151
aVWhere are the defenders standing? What are their distances?
p152
aVWhat are their angles?
p153
aVFor multiple defenders, we can look at how the player's moving
p154
aVand predict the shot type.
p155
aVWe can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts
p156
aVwhat is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances?
p157
aVSo why is this important?
p158
aVWe can take something that was shooting,
p159
aVwhich was one thing before, and turn it into two things:
p160
aVthe quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter.
p161
aVSo here's a bubble chart, because what's TED without a bubble chart?
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VThose are NBA players.
p166
aVThe size is the size of the player and the color is the position.
p167
aVOn the x-axis, we have the shot probability.
p168
aVPeople on the left take difficult shots,
p169
aVon the right, they take easy shots.
p170
aVOn the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.
p171
aVPeople who are good are at the top, bad at the bottom.
p172
aVSo for example, if there was a player
p173
aVwho generally made 47 percent of their shots,
p174
aVthat's all you knew before.
p175
aVBut today, I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player
p176
aVwould make 49 percent of the time,
p177
aVand they are two percent worse.
p178
aVAnd the reason that's important is that there are lots of 47s out there.
p179
aVAnd so it's really important to know
p180
aVif the 47 that you're considering giving 100 million dollars to
p181
aVis a good shooter who takes bad shots
p182
aVor a bad shooter who takes good shots.
p183
aVMachine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players,
p184
aVit changes how we look at the game.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.
p187
aVMiami was down by three, there was 20 seconds left.
p188
aVThey were about to lose the championship.
p189
aVA gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie.
p190
aVHe missed.
p191
aVHis teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,
p192
aVpassed it to another teammate named Ray Allen.
p193
aVHe sank a three. It went into overtime.
p194
aVThey won the game. They won the championship.
p195
aVIt was one of the most exciting games in basketball.
p196
aVAnd our ability to know the shot probability for every player
p197
aVat every second,
p198
aVand the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second
p199
aVcan illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before.
p200
aVNow unfortunately, I can't show you that video.
p201
aVBut for you, we recreated that moment
p202
aVat our weekly basketball game about 3 weeks ago.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd we recreated the tracking that led to the insights.
p207
aVSo, here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,
p208
aVa park we play at every week,
p209
aVand that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment
p210
aVand all the tracking that's associated with it.
p211
aVSo, here's the shot.
p212
aVI'm going to show you that moment
p213
aVand all the insights of that moment.
p214
aVThe only difference is, instead of the professional players, it's us,
p215
aVand instead of a professional announcer, it's me.
p216
aVSo, bear with me.
p217
aa(lp218
VMiami.
p219
aVDown three.
p220
aVTwenty seconds left.
p221
aVJeff brings up the ball.
p222
aVJosh catches, puts up a three!

aVTie game with five seconds left.
p241
aVThe crowd goes wild.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VThat's roughly how it happened.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VRoughly.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause)
p252
aVThat moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA
p253
aVand we know that and a great many other things.
p254
aVI'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VOkay, I will! It was four.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VWay to go, Daria.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut the important thing about that video
p265
aVand the insights we have for every second of every NBA game \u2014 it's not that.
p266
aVIt's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement.
p267
aVYou do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement.
p268
aa(lp269
VIn fact, it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere.
p270
aVWe're moving in our homes,
p271
aVin our offices,
p272
aVas we shop and we travel
p273
aVthroughout our cities
p274
aVand around our world.
p275
aVWhat will we know? What will we learn?
p276
aVPerhaps, instead of identifying pick-and-rolls,
p277
aVa machine can identify the moment and let me know
p278
aVwhen my daughter takes her first steps.
p279
aVWhich could literally be happening any second now.
p280
aa(lp281
VPerhaps we can learn to better use our buildings, better plan our cities.
p282
aVI believe that with the development of the science of moving dots,
p283
aVwe will move better, we will move smarter, we will move forward.
p284
