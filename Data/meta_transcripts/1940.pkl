VThe 2011 Arab Spring
p4
aVcaptured the attention of the world.
p5
aVIt also captured the attention
p6
aVof authoritarian governments in other countries,
p7
aVwho were worried that revolution would spread.
p8
aVTo respond, they ramped up surveillance
p9
aVof activists, journalists and dissidents
p10
aVwho they feared would inspire revolution
p11
aVin their own countries.
p12
aVOne prominent Bahraini activist,
p13
aVwho was arrested and tortured by his government,
p14
aVhas said that the interrogators showed him
p15
aVtranscripts of his telephone calls
p16
aVand text messages.
p17
aa(lp18
VOf course, it's no secret
p19
aVthat governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages.
p20
aVIt's for that reason that many activists
p21
aVspecifically avoid using the telephone.
p22
aVInstead, they use tools like Skype,
p23
aVwhich they think are immune to interception.
p24
aVThey're wrong.
p25
aVThere have now been over the last few years
p26
aVan industry of companies
p27
aVwho provide surveillance technology to governments,
p28
aVspecifically technology that allows those governments
p29
aVto hack into the computers
p30
aVof surveillance targets.
p31
aVRather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire,
p32
aVinstead they now hack into your computer,
p33
aVenable your webcam, enable your microphone,
p34
aVand steal documents from your computer.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen the government of Egypt fell in 2011,
p37
aVactivists raided the office of the secret police,
p38
aVand among the many documents they found
p39
aVwas this document by the Gamma Corporation,
p40
aVby Gamma International.
p41
aVGamma is a German company
p42
aVthat manufactures surveillance software
p43
aVand sells it only to governments.
p44
aVIt's important to note that most governments
p45
aVdon't really have the in-house capabilities
p46
aVto develop this software.
p47
aVSmaller ones don't have the resources
p48
aVor the expertise,
p49
aVand so there's this market of Western companies
p50
aVwho are happy to supply them with the tools
p51
aVand techniques for a price.
p52
aVGamma is just one of these companies.
p53
aVI should note also that Gamma never actually sold
p54
aVtheir software to the Egyptian government.
p55
aVThey'd sent them an invoice for a sale,
p56
aVbut the Egyptians never bought it.
p57
aVInstead, apparently, the Egyptian government
p58
aVused a free demo version of Gamma's software.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo this screenshot is from a sales video
p62
aVthat Gamma produced.
p63
aVReally, they're just emphasizing
p64
aVin a relatively slick presentation
p65
aVthe fact that the police can sort of sit
p66
aVin an air-conditioned office
p67
aVand remotely monitor someone
p68
aVwithout them having any idea that it's going on.
p69
aVYou know, your webcam light won't turn on.
p70
aVThere's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is the managing director of Gamma International.
p73
aVHis name is Martin Muench.
p74
aVThere are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.
p75
aVThis is perhaps my favorite.
p76
aVI'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.
p77
aVYou can see there's a little sticker
p78
aVthat's placed over his camera.
p79
aVHe knows what kind of surveillance is possible,
p80
aVand so clearly he doesn't want it to be used
p81
aVagainst him.
p82
aVMuench has said that he intends
p83
aVfor his software to be used
p84
aVto capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.
p85
aVOf course, he's also acknowledged that once
p86
aVthe software has been sold to governments,
p87
aVhe has no way of knowing how it can be used.
p88
aVGamma's software has been located on servers
p89
aVin countries around the world,
p90
aVmany with really atrocious track records
p91
aVand human rights violations.
p92
aVThey really are selling their software around the world.
p93
aa(lp94
VGamma is not the only company in the business.
p95
aVAs I said, it's a $5 billion industry.
p96
aVOne of the other big guys in the industry
p97
aVis an Italian company called Hacking Team.
p98
aVNow, Hacking Team has what is probably
p99
aVthe slickest presentation.
p100
aVThe video they've produced is very sexy,
p101
aVand so I'm going to play you a clip
p102
aVjust so you can get a feel
p103
aVboth for the capabilities of the software
p104
aVbut also how it's marketed
p105
aVto their government clients.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Video) Narrator: You want to look  through your target's eyes.
p108
aV(Music)
p109
aVYou have to hack your target.
p110
aV["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"]
p111
aVYou have to hit many different platforms.
p112
aV["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux"]
p113
aVYou have to overcome encryption
p114
aVand capture relevant data.
p115
aV[Skype & encrypted calls, target location,  messaging, relationships,
p116
aVweb browsing, audio & video"]
p117
aVBeing stealth and untraceable.
p118
aV["Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure"]
p119
aVDeployed all over your country.
p120
aV["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot"]
p121
aVExactly what we do.
p122
aa(lp123
VChristopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true,
p124
aVbut, in fact, Hacking Team's software
p125
aVis being sold to governments around the world.
p126
aVLast year we learned, for example,
p127
aVthat it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government.
p128
aVMany, many countries it's been found in.
p129
aVSo, Hacking Team has also been actively courting
p130
aVthe U.S. law enforcement market.
p131
aVIn the last year or so, the company
p132
aVhas opened a sales office in Maryland.
p133
aVThe company has also hired a spokesperson.
p134
aVThey've been attending
p135
aVsurveillance industry conferences
p136
aVwhere law enforcement officials show up.
p137
aVThey've spoken at the conferences.
p138
aVWhat I thought was most fascinating was
p139
aVthey've actually paid for the coffee break
p140
aVat one of the law enforcement conferences
p141
aVearlier this year.
p142
aVI can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team
p143
aVhas sold their technology in the United States,
p144
aVbut what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,
p145
aVit isn't because they haven't been trying hard.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo as I said before,
p148
aVgovernments that don't really have the resources
p149
aVto build their own tools will buy
p150
aVoff-the-shelf surveillance software,
p151
aVand so for that reason,
p152
aVyou see that the government of, say, Tunisia,
p153
aVmight use the same software as the government of Germany.
p154
aVThey're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.
p155
aVThe Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States
p156
aVdoes have the budget to build their own surveillance technology,
p157
aVand so for several years, I've been trying
p158
aVto figure out if and how the FBI
p159
aVis hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.
p160
aa(lp161
VMy friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2014
p162
aVthey're a civil society group \u2014
p163
aVobtained hundreds of documents from the FBI
p164
aVdetailing their next generation of surveillance technologies.
p165
aVMost of these documents were heavily redacted,
p166
aVbut what you can see from the slides,
p167
aVif I zoom in, is this term:
p168
aVRemote Operations Unit.
p169
aVNow, when I first looked into this,
p170
aVI'd never heard of this unit before.
p171
aVI've been studying surveillance for more than six years.
p172
aVI'd never heard of it.
p173
aVAnd so I went online and I did some research,
p174
aVand ultimately I hit the mother lode
p175
aVwhen I went to LinkedIn,
p176
aVthe social networking site for job seekers.
p177
aVThere were lots of former U.S. government contractors
p178
aVwho had at one point worked
p179
aVfor the Remote Operating Unit,
p180
aVand were describing in surprising detail on their CVs
p181
aVwhat they had done in their former job.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVSo I took this information
p184
aVand I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal,
p185
aVand she was able to contact several other
p186
aVformer law enforcement officials
p187
aVwho spoke on background and confirmed
p188
aVthat yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team
p189
aVthat does nothing but hack into the computers
p190
aVof surveillance targets.
p191
aVLike Gamma and Hacking Team,
p192
aVthe FBI also has the capability
p193
aVto remotely activate webcams, microphones,
p194
aVsteal documents, get web browsing information,
p195
aVthe works.
p196
aa(lp197
VThere's sort of a big problem
p198
aVwith governments going into hacking,
p199
aVand that's that terrorists, pedophiles,
p200
aVdrug dealers, journalists and human rights activists
p201
aVall use the same kinds of computers.
p202
aVThere's no drug dealer phone
p203
aVand there's no journalist laptop.
p204
aVWe all use the same technology,
p205
aVand what that means then is that for governments
p206
aVto have the capability to hack into the computers
p207
aVof the real bad guys,
p208
aVthey also have to have the capability
p209
aVto hack into our devices too.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo governments around the world
p212
aVhave been embracing this technology.
p213
aVThey've been embracing hacking
p214
aVas a law enforcement technique,
p215
aVbut without any real debate.
p216
aVIn the United States, where I live,
p217
aVthere have been no congressional hearings.
p218
aVThere's no law that's been passed
p219
aVspecifically authorizing this technique,
p220
aVand because of its power and potential for abuse,
p221
aVit's vital that we have an informed public debate.
p222
aa(lp223
