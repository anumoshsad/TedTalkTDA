VI suspect that
p4
aVevery aid worker in Africa
p5
aVcomes to a time in her career
p6
aVwhen she wants to take all  the money for her project \u2014
p7
aVmaybe it's a school or a training program \u2014
p8
aVpack it in a suitcase,
p9
aVget on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country,
p10
aVand start throwing that money out the window.
p11
aVBecause to a veteran aid worker,
p12
aVthe idea of putting cold, hard cash
p13
aVinto the hands of the poorest people on Earth
p14
aVdoesn't sound crazy,
p15
aVit sounds really satisfying.
p16
aa(lp17
VI had that moment right about the 10-year mark,
p18
aVand luckily, that's also when I learned
p19
aVthat this idea actually exists,
p20
aVand it might be just what the aid system needs.
p21
aVEconomists call it an unconditional cash transfer,
p22
aVand it's exactly that: It's cash given
p23
aVwith no strings attached.
p24
aVGovernments in developing countries
p25
aVhave been doing this for decades,
p26
aVand it's only now, with more evidence
p27
aVand new technology that it's possible
p28
aVto make this a model for delivering aid.
p29
aVIt's a pretty simple idea, right?
p30
aa(lp31
VWell, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff
p32
aVfor the poor?
p33
aVHonestly, I believed that I could do more good
p34
aVwith money for the poor
p35
aVthan the poor could do for themselves.
p36
aVI held two assumptions:
p37
aVOne, that poor people are poor in part
p38
aVbecause they're uneducated and
p39
aVdon't make good choices;
p40
aVtwo is that we then need people like me
p41
aVto figure out what they need and get it to them.
p42
aVIt turns out, the evidence says otherwise.
p43
aVIn recent years, researchers have been studying
p44
aVwhat happens when we give poor people cash.
p45
aVDozens of studies show across the board
p46
aVthat people use cash transfers
p47
aVto improve their own lives.
p48
aVPregnant women in Uruguay buy better food
p49
aVand give birth to healthier babies.
p50
aVSri Lankan men invest in their businesses.
p51
aVResearchers who studied our work in Kenya
p52
aVfound that people invested in a range of assets,
p53
aVfrom livestock to equipment  to home improvements,
p54
aVand they saw increases in income
p55
aVfrom business and farming
p56
aVone year after the cash was sent.
p57
aVNone of these studies found that people
p58
aVspend more on drinking or smoking
p59
aVor that people work less.
p60
aVIn fact, they work more.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, these are all material needs.
p63
aVIn Vietnam, elderly recipients used
p64
aVtheir cash transfers to pay for coffins.
p65
aVAs someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,
p66
aVI find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs
p67
aVdeeply humbling.
p68
aVI don't know if I would have chosen to give food
p69
aVor equipment or coffins,
p70
aVwhich begs the question:
p71
aVHow good are we at allocating resources
p72
aVon behalf of the poor?
p73
aVAre we worth the cost?
p74
aVAgain, we can look at empirical evidence
p75
aVon what happens when we give people stuff
p76
aVof our choosing.
p77
aVOne very telling study looked at a program in India
p78
aVthat gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,
p79
aVand they found that 30 percent of recipients
p80
aVhad turned around and sold the livestock they had been given
p81
aVfor cash.
p82
aVThe real irony is,
p83
aVfor every 100 dollars worth of assets
p84
aVthis program gave someone,
p85
aVthey spent another 99 dollars to do it.
p86
aVWhat if, instead, we use technology to put cash,
p87
aVwhether from aid agencies or from any one of us
p88
aVdirectly into a poor person's hands.
p89
aVToday, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,
p90
aVwhich is basically a bank account that can run
p91
aVon any cell phone.
p92
aVA sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee
p93
aVand with the click of a button
p94
aVsend money directly to a recipient's account
p95
aVwith no intermediaries.
p96
aVLike the technologies that are disrupting industries
p97
aVin our own lives,
p98
aVpayments technology in poor countries
p99
aVcould disrupt aid.
p100
aVIt's spreading so quickly that it's possible
p101
aVto imagine reaching billions
p102
aVof the world's poor this way.
p103
aa(lp104
VThat's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.
p105
aVWe're the first organization
p106
aVdedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.
p107
aVWe've sent cash to 35,000  people across rural Kenya
p108
aVand Uganda
p109
aVin one-time payments of 1,000 dollars
p110
aVper family.
p111
aVSo far, we've looked for the poorest people
p112
aVin the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,
p113
aVthey're the ones living in homes
p114
aVmade of mud and thatch,
p115
aVnot cement and iron.
p116
aVSo let's say that's your family.
p117
aVWe show up at your door with an Android phone.
p118
aVWe'll get your name, take your photo
p119
aVand a photo of your hut
p120
aVand grab the GPS coordinates.
p121
aVThat night, we send all the data to the cloud,
p122
aVand each piece gets checked
p123
aVby an independent team
p124
aVusing, for one example, satellite images.
p125
aVThen, we'll come back,
p126
aVwe'll sell you a basic cell phone
p127
aVif you don't have one already,
p128
aVand a few weeks later,
p129
aVwe send money to it.
p130
aVSomething that five years ago
p131
aVwould have seemed impossible
p132
aVwe can now do efficiently
p133
aVand free of corruption.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe more cash we give to the poor,
p136
aVand the more evidence we have that it works,
p137
aVthe more we have to reconsider
p138
aVeverything else we give.
p139
aVToday, the logic behind aid is too often,
p140
aVwell, we do at least some good.
p141
aVWhen we're complacent
p142
aVwith that as our bar,
p143
aVwhen we tell ourselves that giving aid
p144
aVis better than no aid at all,
p145
aVwe tend to invest inefficiently,
p146
aVin our own ideas that strike us as innovative,
p147
aVon writing reports,
p148
aVon plane tickets and SUVs.
p149
aVWhat if the logic was,
p150
aVwill we do better than cash given directly?
p151
aVOrganizations would have to prove
p152
aVthat they're doing more good for the poor
p153
aVthan the poor can do for themselves.
p154
aVOf course, giving cash won't create public goods
p155
aVlike eradicating disease or  building strong institutions,
p156
aVbut it could set a higher bar
p157
aVfor how we help individual families
p158
aVimprove their lives.
p159
aa(lp160
VI believe in aid.
p161
aVI believe most aid is better than just
p162
aVthrowing money out of a plane.
p163
aVI am also absolutely certain
p164
aVthat a lot of aid today
p165
aVisn't better than giving directly to the poor.
p166
aVI hope that one day, it will be.
