VWe've got a real problem with math education right now.
p4
aVBasically, no one's very happy.
p5
aVThose learning it
p6
aVthink it's disconnected,
p7
aVuninteresting and hard.
p8
aVThose trying to employ them
p9
aVthink they don't know enough.
p10
aVGovernments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,
p11
aVbut don't know how to fix it.
p12
aVAnd teachers are also frustrated.
p13
aVYet math is more important to the world
p14
aVthan at any point in human history.
p15
aVSo at one end we've got falling interest
p16
aVin education in math,
p17
aVand at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,
p18
aVa more quantitative world than we ever have had.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,
p21
aVand what can we do to fix it?
p22
aVWell actually, I think the answer
p23
aVis staring us right in the face:
p24
aVUse computers.
p25
aVI believe
p26
aVthat correctly using computers
p27
aVis the silver bullet
p28
aVfor making math education work.
p29
aVSo to explain that,
p30
aVlet me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world
p31
aVand what it looks like in education.
p32
aVSee, in the real world
p33
aVmath isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
p34
aVIt's done by geologists,
p35
aVengineers, biologists,
p36
aVall sorts of different people \u2014
p37
aVmodeling and simulation.
p38
aVIt's actually very popular.
p39
aVBut in education it looks very different \u2014
p40
aVdumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,
p41
aVmostly by hand.
p42
aVLots of things that seem simple
p43
aVand not difficult like in the real world,
p44
aVexcept if you're learning it.
p45
aVAnd another thing about math:
p46
aVmath sometimes looks like math \u2014
p47
aVlike in this example here \u2014
p48
aVand sometimes it doesn't \u2014
p49
aVlike "Am I drunk?"
p50
aVAnd then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.
p51
aVYou wouldn't have expected that a few years back.
p52
aVBut now you can find out all about \u2014
p53
aVunfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but \u2014
p54
aVall about what happens.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo let's zoom out a bit and ask,
p57
aVwhy are we teaching people math?
p58
aVWhat's the point of teaching people math?
p59
aVAnd in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
p60
aVWhy is it such an important part of education
p61
aVas a sort of compulsory subject?
p62
aVWell, I think there are about three reasons:
p63
aVtechnical jobs
p64
aVso critical to the development of our economies,
p65
aVwhat I call "everyday living" \u2014
p66
aVto function in the world today,
p67
aVyou've got to be pretty quantitative,
p68
aVmuch more so than a few years ago:
p69
aVfigure out your mortgages,
p70
aVbeing skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things \u2014
p71
aVand thirdly, what I would call something like
p72
aVlogical mind training, logical thinking.
p73
aVOver the years
p74
aVwe've put so much in society
p75
aVinto being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.
p76
aVIt's very important to learn that
p77
aVmath is a great way to do that.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo let's ask another question.
p80
aVWhat is math?
p81
aVWhat do we mean when we say we're doing math,
p82
aVor educating people to do math?
p83
aVWell, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,
p84
aVstarting with posing the right question.
p85
aVWhat is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?
p86
aVAnd this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,
p87
aVbeyond virtually any other part of doing math.
p88
aVPeople ask the wrong question,
p89
aVand surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,
p90
aVfor that reason, if not for others.
p91
aVSo the next thing is take that problem
p92
aVand turn it from a real world problem
p93
aVinto a math problem.
p94
aVThat's stage two.
p95
aVOnce you've done that, then there's the computation step.
p96
aVTurn it from that into some answer
p97
aVin a mathematical form.
p98
aVAnd of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
p99
aVAnd then finally, turn it back to the real world.
p100
aVDid it answer the question?
p101
aVAnd also verify it \u2014 crucial step.
p102
aVNow here's the crazy thing right now.
p103
aVIn math education,
p104
aVwe're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time
p105
aVteaching people to do step three by hand.
p106
aVYet, that's the one step computers can do
p107
aVbetter than any human after years of practice.
p108
aVInstead, we ought to be using computers
p109
aVto do step three
p110
aVand using the students to spend much more effort
p111
aVon learning how to do steps one, two and four \u2014
p112
aVconceptualizing problems, applying them,
p113
aVgetting the teacher to run them through how to do that.
p114
aa(lp115
VSee, crucial point here:
p116
aVmath is not equal to calculating.
p117
aVMath is a much broader subject than calculating.
p118
aVNow it's understandable that this has all got intertwined
p119
aVover hundreds of years.
p120
aVThere was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
p121
aVBut in the last few decades
p122
aVthat has totally changed.
p123
aVWe've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject
p124
aVthat I could ever imagine with computers.
p125
aVCalculating was typically the limiting step,
p126
aVand now often it isn't.
p127
aVSo I think in terms of the fact that math
p128
aVhas been liberated from calculating.
p129
aVBut that math liberation didn't get into education yet.
p130
aVSee, I think of calculating, in a sense,
p131
aVas the machinery of math.
p132
aVIt's the chore.
p133
aVIt's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
p134
aVIt's a means to an end, not an end in itself,
p135
aVand automation allows us
p136
aVto have that machinery.
p137
aVComputers allow us to do that \u2014
p138
aVand this is not a small problem by any means.
p139
aVI estimated that, just today, across the world,
p140
aVwe spent about 106 average world lifetimes
p141
aVteaching people how to calculate by hand.
p142
aVThat's an amazing amount of human endeavor.
p143
aVSo we better be damn sure \u2014
p144
aVand by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them \u2014
p145
aVso we better be damn sure
p146
aVthat we know why we're doing that
p147
aVand it has a real purpose.
p148
aa(lp149
VI think we should be assuming computers
p150
aVfor doing the calculating
p151
aVand only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.
p152
aVAnd I think there are some cases.
p153
aVFor example: mental arithmetic.
p154
aVI still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.
p155
aVPeople say, "Is such and such true?"
p156
aVAnd I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.
p157
aVIt's still quicker to do that and more practical.
p158
aVSo I think practicality is one case
p159
aVwhere it's worth teaching people by hand.
p160
aVAnd then there are certain conceptual things
p161
aVthat can also benefit from hand calculating,
p162
aVbut I think they're relatively small in number.
p163
aVOne thing I often ask about
p164
aVis ancient Greek and how this relates.
p165
aVSee, the thing we're doing right now
p166
aVis we're forcing people to learn mathematics.
p167
aVIt's a major subject.
p168
aVI'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating
p169
aVor in following their own interests
p170
aVin any subject however bizarre \u2014
p171
aVthey should do that.
p172
aVThat's absolutely the right thing,
p173
aVfor people to follow their self-interest.
p174
aVI was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,
p175
aVbut I don't think that we should force the entire population
p176
aVto learn a subject like ancient Greek.
p177
aVI don't think it's warranted.
p178
aVSo I have this distinction between what we're making people do
p179
aVand the subject that's sort of mainstream
p180
aVand the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest
p181
aVand perhaps even be spiked into doing that.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo what are the issues people bring up with this?
p184
aVWell one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.
p185
aVYou shouldn't use the machine
p186
aVuntil you get the basics of the subject.
p187
aVSo my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"
p188
aVBasics of what?
p189
aVAre the basics of driving a car
p190
aVlearning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
p191
aVAre the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?
p192
aVI don't think so.
p193
aVI think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do
p194
aVfrom how it gets done
p195
aVand the machinery of how it gets done
p196
aVand automation allows you to make that separation.
p197
aVA hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car
p198
aVyou kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car
p199
aVand how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.
p200
aVBut automation in cars
p201
aVallowed that to separate,
p202
aVso driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,
p203
aVfrom engineering of the car
p204
aVor learning how to service it.
p205
aVSo automation allows this separation
p206
aVand also allows \u2014 in the case of driving,
p207
aVand I believe also in the future case of maths \u2014
p208
aVa democratized way of doing that.
p209
aVIt can be spread across a much larger number of people
p210
aVwho can really work with that.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo there's another thing that comes up with basics.
p213
aVPeople confuse, in my view,
p214
aVthe order of the invention of the tools
p215
aVwith the order in which they should use them for teaching.
p216
aVSo just because paper was invented before computers,
p217
aVit doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject
p218
aVby using paper instead of a computer
p219
aVto teach mathematics.
p220
aVMy daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.
p221
aVShe enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVSo I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,
p224
aVI didn't make these.
p225
aVWhy do you think that was?"
p226
aVAnd after a second or two, carefully reflecting,
p227
aVshe said, "No paper?"
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVIf you were born after computers and paper,
p230
aVit doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,
p231
aVyou just want to have the best tool.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."
p234
aVThat somehow, if you use a computer,
p235
aVit's all mindless button-pushing,
p236
aVbut if you do it by hand,
p237
aVit's all intellectual.
p238
aVThis one kind of annoys me, I must say.
p239
aVDo we really believe
p240
aVthat the math that most people are doing in school
p241
aVpractically today
p242
aVis more than applying procedures
p243
aVto problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?
p244
aVI don't think so.
p245
aVAnd what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.
p246
aVMight have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
p247
aVWhen they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
p248
aVJust to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,
p249
aVactually make it more conceptual.
p250
aVNow, of course, like any great tool,
p251
aVthey can be used completely mindlessly,
p252
aVlike turning everything into a multimedia show,
p253
aVlike the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,
p254
aVwhere the computer was the teacher \u2014
p255
aVshow the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.
p256
aVThis is just nuts.
p257
aVWhy are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand
p258
aVthat the computer should be doing anyway?
p259
aVAll backwards.
p260
aa(lp261
VLet me show you
p262
aVthat you can also make problems harder to calculate.
p263
aVSee, normally in school,
p264
aVyou do things like solve quadratic equations.
p265
aVBut you see, when you're using a computer,
p266
aVyou can just substitute.
p267
aVYou can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.
p268
aVSame principles applied \u2014
p269
aVcalculations, harder.
p270
aVAnd problems in the real world
p271
aVlook nutty and horrible like this.
p272
aVThey've got hair all over them.
p273
aVThey're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.
p274
aVAnd think of the outside world.
p275
aVDo we really believe that engineering and biology
p276
aVand all of these other things
p277
aVthat have so benefited from computers and maths
p278
aVhave somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?
p279
aVI don't think so \u2014 quite the opposite.
p280
aVSo the problem we've really got in math education
p281
aVis not that computers might dumb it down,
p282
aVbut that we have dumbed-down problems right now.
p283
aVWell, another issue people bring up
p284
aVis somehow that hand calculating procedures
p285
aVteach understanding.
p286
aVSo if you go through lots of examples,
p287
aVyou can get the answer,
p288
aVyou can understand how the basics of the system work better.
p289
aVI think there is one thing that I think very valid here,
p290
aVwhich is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
p291
aVBut there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
p292
aVIt's called programming.
p293
aa(lp294
VProgramming is how most procedures and processes
p295
aVget written down these days,
p296
aVand it's also a great way
p297
aVto engage students much more
p298
aVand to check they really understand.
p299
aVIf you really want to check you understand math
p300
aVthen write a program to do it.
p301
aVSo programming is the way I think we should be doing that.
p302
aVSo to be clear, what I really am suggesting here
p303
aVis we have a unique opportunity
p304
aVto make maths both more practical
p305
aVand more conceptual, simultaneously.
p306
aVI can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.
p307
aVIt's usually some kind of choice
p308
aVbetween the vocational and the intellectual.
p309
aVBut I think we can do both at the same time here.
p310
aVAnd we open up so many more possibilities.
p311
aVYou can do so many more problems.
p312
aVWhat I really think we gain from this
p313
aVis students getting intuition and experience
p314
aVin far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
p315
aVAnd experience of harder problems \u2014
p316
aVbeing able to play with the math, interact with it,
p317
aVfeel it.
p318
aVWe want people who can feel the math instinctively.
p319
aVThat's what computers allow us to do.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnother thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
p322
aVTraditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,
p323
aVbut now we can reorder it
p324
aVby how difficult it is to understand the concepts,
p325
aVhowever hard the calculating.
p326
aVSo calculus has traditionally been taught very late.
p327
aVWhy is this?
p328
aVWell, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.
p329
aVBut actually many of the concepts
p330
aVare amenable to a much younger age group.
p331
aVThis was an example I built for my daughter.
p332
aVAnd very, very simple.
p333
aVWe were talking about what happens
p334
aVwhen you increase the number of sides of a polygon
p335
aVto a very large number.
p336
aVAnd of course, it turns into a circle.
p337
aVAnd by the way, she was also very insistent
p338
aVon being able to change the color,
p339
aVan important feature for this demonstration.
p340
aVYou can see that this is a very early step
p341
aVinto limits and differential calculus
p342
aVand what happens when you take things to an extreme \u2014
p343
aVand very small sides and a very large number of sides.
p344
aVVery simple example.
p345
aVThat's a view of the world
p346
aVthat we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.
p347
aVAnd yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
p348
aVSo one of the roadblocks we have
p349
aVin moving this agenda forward
p350
aVis exams.
p351
aVIn the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,
p352
aVit's kind of hard to get the curricula changed
p353
aVto a point where they can use computers
p354
aVduring the semesters.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd one of the reasons it's so important \u2014
p357
aVso it's very important to get computers in exams.
p358
aVAnd then we can ask questions, real questions,
p359
aVquestions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? \u2014
p360
aVreal questions that people have in their everyday lives.
p361
aVAnd you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.
p362
aVThis is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.
p363
aVHow many years of protection do I need?
p364
aVWhat does that do to the payments
p365
aVand to the interest rates and so forth?
p366
aVNow I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question
p367
aVthat should be asked in exams,
p368
aVbut I think it's a very important type
p369
aVthat right now just gets completely ignored
p370
aVand is critical for people's real understanding.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo I believe [there is] critical reform
p373
aVwe have to do in computer-based math.
p374
aVWe have got to make sure
p375
aVthat we can move our economies forward,
p376
aVand also our societies,
p377
aVbased on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.
p378
aVThis isn't some optional extra.
p379
aVAnd the country that does this first
p380
aVwill, in my view, leapfrog others
p381
aVin achieving a new economy even,
p382
aVan improved economy,
p383
aVan improved outlook.
p384
aVIn fact, I even talk about us moving
p385
aVfrom what we often call now the "knowledge economy"
p386
aVto what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"
p387
aVwhere high-level math is integral to what everyone does
p388
aVin the way that knowledge currently is.
p389
aVWe can engage so many more students with this,
p390
aVand they can have a better time doing it.
p391
aVAnd let's understand:
p392
aVthis is not an incremental sort of change.
p393
aVWe're trying to cross the chasm here
p394
aVbetween school math and the real-world math.
p395
aVAnd you know if you walk across a chasm,
p396
aVyou end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all \u2014
p397
aVbigger disaster.
p398
aVNo, what I'm suggesting
p399
aVis that we should leap off,
p400
aVwe should increase our velocity
p401
aVso it's high,
p402
aVand we should leap off one side and go the other \u2014
p403
aVof course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VSo I want to see
p408
aVa completely renewed, changed math curriculum
p409
aVbuilt from the ground up,
p410
aVbased on computers being there,
p411
aVcomputers that are now ubiquitous almost.
p412
aVCalculating machines are everywhere
p413
aVand will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
p414
aVNow I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,
p415
aVbut what I am sure is
p416
aVit's the mainstream subject of the future.
p417
aVLet's go for it,
p418
aVand while we're about it,
p419
aVlet's have a bit of fun,
p420
aVfor us, for the students and for TED here.
