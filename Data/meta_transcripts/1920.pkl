VThe urban explosion
p4
aVof the last years of economic boom
p5
aValso produced dramatic marginalization,
p6
aVresulting in the explosion of slums
p7
aVin many parts of the world.
p8
aVThis polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth
p9
aVsurrounded by sectors of poverty
p10
aVand the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered
p11
aVis really at the center of today's urban crisis.
p12
aVBut I want to begin tonight
p13
aVby suggesting that this urban crisis
p14
aVis not only economic or environmental.
p15
aVIt's particularly a cultural crisis,
p16
aVa crisis of the institutions
p17
aVunable to reimagine the stupid ways
p18
aVwhich we have been growing,
p19
aVunable to challenge the oil-hungry,
p20
aVselfish urbanization that have perpetuated
p21
aVcities based on consumption,
p22
aVfrom southern California to New York to Dubai.
p23
aVSo I just really want to share with you a reflection
p24
aVthat the future of cities today
p25
aVdepends less on buildings
p26
aVand, in fact, depends more
p27
aVon the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations,
p28
aVthat the best ideas in the shaping
p29
aVof the city in the future
p30
aVwill not come from enclaves of economic power
p31
aVand abundance,
p32
aVbut in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity
p33
aVfrom which an urgent imagination
p34
aVcan really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd let me illustrate what I mean
p37
aVby understanding or engaging sites of conflict
p38
aVas harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you
p39
aVto the Tijuana-San Diego border region,
p40
aVwhich has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is the wall, the border wall,
p43
aVthat separates San Diego and Tijuana,
p44
aVLatin America and the United States,
p45
aVa physical emblem
p46
aVof exclusionary planning policies
p47
aVthat have perpetuated the division
p48
aVof communities, jurisdictions
p49
aVand resources across the world.
p50
aVIn this border region, we find
p51
aVsome of the wealthiest real estate,
p52
aVas I once found in the edges of San Diego,
p53
aVbarely 20 minutes away
p54
aVfrom some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America.
p55
aVAnd while these two cities have the same population,
p56
aVSan Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana
p57
aVin the last decades,
p58
aVimmediately thrusting us to confront
p59
aVthe tensions and conflicts
p60
aVbetween sprawl and density,
p61
aVwhich are at the center of today's discussion
p62
aVabout environmental sustainability.
p63
aVSo I've been arguing in the last years
p64
aVthat, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot
p65
aVto the sprawls of San Diego
p66
aVwhen it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,
p67
aVthat we should pay attention and learn
p68
aVfrom the many migrant communities
p69
aVon both sides of this border wall
p70
aVso that we can translate their informal processes
p71
aVof urbanization.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhat do I mean by the informal in this case?
p74
aVI'm really just talking about
p75
aVthe compendium of social practices of adaptation
p76
aVthat enable many of these migrant communities
p77
aVto transgress imposed political and economic recipes
p78
aVof urbanization.
p79
aVI'm talking simply about the creative intelligence
p80
aVof the bottom-up,
p81
aVwhether manifested in the slums of Tijuana
p82
aVthat build themselves, in fact, with the waste of San Diego,
p83
aVor the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California
p84
aVthat have begun to be retrofitted with difference
p85
aVin the last decades.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo I've been interested as an artist
p88
aVin the measuring, the observation,
p89
aVof many of the trans-border informal flows
p90
aVacross this border:
p91
aVin one direction, from south to north,
p92
aVthe flow of immigrants into the United States,
p93
aVand from north to south the flow of waste
p94
aVfrom southern California into Tijuana.
p95
aVI'm referring to the recycling
p96
aVof these old post-war bungalows
p97
aVthat Mexican contractors bring to the border
p98
aVas American developers are disposing of them
p99
aVin the process of building a more inflated version
p100
aVof suburbia in the last decades.
p101
aVSo these are houses waiting to cross the border.
p102
aVNot only people cross the border here,
p103
aVbut entire chunks of one city move to the next,
p104
aVand when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames,
p105
aVthey leave the first floor to become the second
p106
aVto be in-filled with more house,
p107
aVwith a small business.
p108
aVThis layering of spaces and economies
p109
aVis very interesting to notice.
p110
aVBut not only houses, also small debris
p111
aVfrom one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.
p112
aVProbably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires
p113
aVthat are used in the slums to build retaining walls.
p114
aVBut look at what people have done here in conditions
p115
aVof socioeconomic emergency.
p116
aVThey have figured out how to peel off the tire,
p117
aVhow to thread it and interlock it
p118
aVto construct a more efficient retaining wall.
p119
aVOr the garage doors that are brought
p120
aVfrom San Diego in trucks
p121
aVto become the new skin of emergency housing
p122
aVin many of these slums
p123
aVsurrounding the edges of Tijuana.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo while, as an architect,
p126
aVthis is a very compelling thing to witness,
p127
aVthis creative intelligence,
p128
aVI also want to keep myself in check.
p129
aVI don't want to romanticize poverty.
p130
aVI just want to suggest
p131
aVthat this informal urbanization
p132
aVis not just the image of precariousness,
p133
aVthat informality here, the informal,
p134
aVis really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures
p135
aVthat we could translate as artists,
p136
aVthat this is about a bottom-up urbanization
p137
aVthat performs.
p138
aVSee here, buildings are not important
p139
aVjust for their looks,
p140
aVbut, in fact, they are important for what they can do.
p141
aVThey truly perform as they transform through time
p142
aVand as communities negotiate
p143
aVthe spaces and boundaries and resources.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo while waste flows southbound,
p146
aVpeople go north in search of dollars,
p147
aVand most of my research has had to do
p148
aVwith the impact of immigration
p149
aVin the alteration of the homogeneity
p150
aVof many neighborhoods in the United States,
p151
aVparticularly in San Diego.
p152
aVAnd I'm talking about how this begins to suggest
p153
aVthat the future of Southern California
p154
aVdepends on the retrofitting
p155
aVof the large urbanization \u2014 I mean, on steroids \u2014
p156
aVwith the small programs,
p157
aVsocial and economic.
p158
aVI'm referring to how immigrants,
p159
aVwhen they come to these neighborhoods,
p160
aVthey begin to alter the one-dimensionality
p161
aVof parcels and properties
p162
aVinto more socially and economically complex systems,
p163
aVas they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage,
p164
aVor as they build an illegal granny flat
p165
aVto support an extended family.
p166
aVThis socioeconomic entrepreneurship
p167
aVon the ground within these neighborhoods
p168
aVreally begins to suggest ways of translating that
p169
aVinto new, inclusive and more equitable
p170
aVland use policies.
p171
aVSo many stories emerge from these dynamics
p172
aVof alteration of space,
p173
aVsuch as "the informal Buddha,"
p174
aVwhich tells the story of a small house
p175
aVthat saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,
p176
aVbut it was retrofitted in the end
p177
aVinto a Buddhist temple,
p178
aVand in so doing,
p179
aVthis small house transforms or mutates
p180
aVfrom a singular dwelling
p181
aVinto a small, or a micro, socioeconomic
p182
aVand cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo these action neighborhoods, as I call them,
p185
aVreally become the inspiration
p186
aVto imagine other interpretations of citizenship
p187
aVthat have less to do, in fact,
p188
aVwith belonging to the nation-state,
p189
aVand more with upholding the notion of citizenship
p190
aVas a creative act
p191
aVthat reorganizes institutional protocols
p192
aVin the spaces of the city.
p193
aa(lp194
VAs an artist, I've been interested, in fact,
p195
aVin the visualization of citizenship,
p196
aVthe gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,
p197
aVin order to narrativize the relationship
p198
aVbetween social processes and spaces.
p199
aVThis is a story of a group of teenagers
p200
aVthat one night, a few months ago,
p201
aVdecided to invade this space under the freeway
p202
aVto begin constructing their own skateboard park.
p203
aVWith shovels in hand, they started to dig.
p204
aVTwo weeks later, the police stopped them.
p205
aVThey barricaded the place,
p206
aVand the teenagers were evicted,
p207
aVand the teenagers decided to fight back,
p208
aVnot with bank cards or slogans
p209
aVbut with constructing a critical process.
p210
aVThe first thing they did was to recognize
p211
aVthe specificity of political jurisdiction
p212
aVinscribed in that empty space.
p213
aVThey found out that they had been lucky
p214
aVbecause they had not begun to dig
p215
aVunder Caltrans territoy.
p216
aVCaltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,
p217
aVso it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them.
p218
aVThey were lucky, they said, because they began
p219
aVto dig under an arm of the freeway
p220
aVthat belongs to the local municipality.
p221
aVThey were also lucky, they said,
p222
aVbecause they began to dig in a sort of
p223
aVBermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,
p224
aVbetween port authority, airport authority,
p225
aVtwo city districts, and a review board.
p226
aVAll these red lines are the invisible
p227
aVpolitical institutions that were inscribed
p228
aVin that leftover empty space.
p229
aVWith this knowledge, these teenagers
p230
aVas skaters confronted the city.
p231
aVThey came to the city attorney's office.
p232
aVThe city attorney told them
p233
aVthat in order to continue the negotiation
p234
aVthey had to become an NGO,
p235
aVand of course they didn't know what an NGO was.
p236
aVThey had to talk to their friends in Seattle
p237
aVwho had gone through the same experience.
p238
aVAnd they began to realize the necessity
p239
aVto organize themselves even deeper
p240
aVand began to fundraise, to organize budgets,
p241
aVto really be aware of all the knowledge
p242
aVembedded in the urban code in San Diego
p243
aVso that they could begin to redefine
p244
aVthe very meaning of public space in the city,
p245
aVexpanding it to other categories.
p246
aVAt the end, the teenagers won the case
p247
aVwith that evidence, and they were able
p248
aVto construct their skateboard park
p249
aVunder that freeway.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow for many of you, this story
p252
aVmight seem trivial or naive.
p253
aVFor me as an architect, it has become
p254
aVa fundamental narrative,
p255
aVbecause it begins to teach me
p256
aVthat this micro-community
p257
aVnot only designed another category of public space
p258
aVbut they also designed the socioeconomic protocols
p259
aVthat were necessary to be inscribed in that space
p260
aVfor its long-term sustainability.
p261
aVThey also taught me
p262
aVthat similar to the migrant communities
p263
aVon both sides of the border,
p264
aVthey engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,
p265
aVbecause they had to produce a process
p266
aVthat enabled them to reorganize resources
p267
aVand the politics of the city.
p268
aVIn that act, that informal,
p269
aVbottom-up act of transgression,
p270
aVreally began to trickle up
p271
aVto transform top-down policy.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow this journey from the bottom-up
p274
aVto the transformation of the top-down
p275
aVis where I find hope today.
p276
aVAnd I'm thinking of how these modest alterations
p277
aVwith space and with policy
p278
aVin many cities in the world,
p279
aVin primarily the urgency
p280
aVof a collective imagination
p281
aVas these communities
p282
aVreimagine their own forms of governance,
p283
aVsocial organization, and infrastructure,
p284
aVreally is at the center
p285
aVof the new formation
p286
aVof democratic politics of the urban.
p287
aVIt is, in fact, this that could become the framework
p288
aVfor producing new social
p289
aVand economic justice in the city.
p290
aVI want to say this and emphasize it,
p291
aVbecause this is the only way I see
p292
aVthat can enable us to move
p293
aVfrom urbanizations of consumption
p294
aVto neighborhoods of production today.
