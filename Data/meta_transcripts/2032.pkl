VEvery day we face issues like climate change
p4
aVor the safety of vaccines
p5
aVwhere we have to answer questions whose answers
p6
aVrely heavily on scientific information.
p7
aVScientists tell us that the world is warming.
p8
aVScientists tell us that vaccines are safe.
p9
aVBut how do we know if they are right?
p10
aVWhy should be believe the science?
p11
aVThe fact is, many of us actually don't believe the science.
p12
aVPublic opinion polls consistently show
p13
aVthat significant proportions of the American people
p14
aVdon't believe the climate is warming due to human activities,
p15
aVdon't think that there is evolution by natural selection,
p16
aVand aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo why should we believe the science?
p19
aVWell, scientists don't like talking about  science as a matter of belief.
p20
aVIn fact, they would contrast science with faith,
p21
aVand they would say belief is the domain of faith.
p22
aVAnd faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science.
p23
aVIndeed they would say religion is based on faith
p24
aVor maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.
p25
aVBlaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician
p26
aVwho tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of
p27
aVwhether or not he should believe in God,
p28
aVand his wager went like this:
p29
aVWell, if God doesn't exist
p30
aVbut I decide to believe in him
p31
aVnothing much is really lost.
p32
aVMaybe a few hours on Sunday.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVBut if he does exist and I don't believe in him,
p35
aVthen I'm in deep trouble.
p36
aVAnd so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.
p37
aVOr as one of my college professors said,
p38
aV"He clutched for the handrail of faith."
p39
aVHe made that leap of faith
p40
aVleaving science and rationalism behind.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow the fact is though, for most of us,
p43
aVmost scientific claims are a leap of faith.
p44
aVWe can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases.
p45
aVAnd indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well
p46
aVoutside of their own specialties.
p47
aVSo if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you
p48
aVwhether a vaccine is safe.
p49
aVMost chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.
p50
aVA physicist cannot tell you,
p51
aVdespite the claims of some of them,
p52
aVwhether or not tobacco causes cancer.
p53
aVSo, if even scientists themselves
p54
aVhave to make a leap of faith
p55
aVoutside their own fields,
p56
aVthen why do they accept the claims of other scientists?
p57
aVWhy do they believe each other's claims?
p58
aVAnd should we believe those claims?
p59
aa(lp60
VSo what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,
p61
aVbut not for the reason that most of us think.
p62
aVMost of us were taught in school that the reason we should
p63
aVbelieve in science is because of the scientific method.
p64
aVWe were taught that scientists follow a method
p65
aVand that this method guarantees
p66
aVthe truth of their claims.
p67
aVThe method that most of us were taught in school,
p68
aVwe can call it the textbook method,
p69
aVis the hypothetical deductive method.
p70
aVAccording to the standard model, the textbook model,
p71
aVscientists develop hypotheses, they deduce
p72
aVthe consequences of those hypotheses,
p73
aVand then they go out into the world and they say,
p74
aV"Okay, well are those consequences true?"
p75
aVCan we observe them taking place in the natural world?
p76
aVAnd if they are true, then the scientists say,
p77
aV"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct."
p78
aa(lp79
VSo there are many famous examples in the history
p80
aVof science of scientists doing exactly this.
p81
aVOne of the most famous examples
p82
aVcomes from the work of Albert Einstein.
p83
aVWhen Einstein developed the theory of general relativity,
p84
aVone of the consequences of his theory
p85
aVwas that space-time wasn't just an empty void
p86
aVbut that it actually had a fabric.
p87
aVAnd that that fabric was bent
p88
aVin the presence of massive objects like the sun.
p89
aVSo if this theory were true then it meant that light
p90
aVas it passed the sun
p91
aVshould actually be bent around it.
p92
aVThat was a pretty startling prediction
p93
aVand it took a few years before scientists
p94
aVwere able to test it
p95
aVbut they did test it in 1919,
p96
aVand lo and behold it turned out to be true.
p97
aVStarlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun.
p98
aVThis was a huge confirmation of the theory.
p99
aVIt was considered proof of the truth
p100
aVof this radical new idea,
p101
aVand it was written up in many newspapers
p102
aVaround the globe.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, sometimes this theory or this model
p105
aVis referred to as the deductive-nomological model,
p106
aVmainly because academics like  to make things complicated.
p107
aVBut also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.
p108
aVSo nomological means having to do with laws.
p109
aVAnd in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:
p110
aVideally, it is a law of nature.
p111
aVWhy does it matter that it is a law of nature?
p112
aVBecause if it is a law, it can't be broken.
p113
aVIf it's a law then it will always be true
p114
aVin all times and all places
p115
aVno matter what the circumstances are.
p116
aVAnd all of you know of at least one example of a famous law:
p117
aVEinstein's famous equation, E=MC2,
p118
aVwhich tells us what the relationship is
p119
aVbetween energy and mass.
p120
aVAnd that relationship is true no matter what.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, it turns out, though, that there  are several problems with this model.
p123
aVThe main problem is that it's wrong.
p124
aVIt's just not true. (Laughter)
p125
aVAnd I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong.
p126
aVSo the first reason is a logical reason.
p127
aVIt's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
p128
aVSo that's another fancy, academic way of saying
p129
aVthat false theories can make true predictions.
p130
aVSo just because the prediction comes true
p131
aVdoesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct.
p132
aVAnd I have a good example of that too,  again from the history of science.
p133
aVThis is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe
p134
aVwith the Earth at the center of the universe
p135
aVand the sun and the planets going around it.
p136
aVThe Ptolemaic model was believed
p137
aVby many very smart people for many centuries.
p138
aVWell, why?
p139
aVWell the answer is because it made  lots of predictions that came true.
p140
aVThe Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers
p141
aVto make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet,
p142
aVin fact more accurate predictions at first
p143
aVthan the Copernican theory which we now would say is true.
p144
aVSo that's one problem with the textbook model.
p145
aVA second problem is a practical problem,
p146
aVand it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.
p147
aVAuxiliary hypotheses are assumptions
p148
aVthat scientists are making
p149
aVthat they may or may not even be aware that they're making.
p150
aVSo an important example of this
p151
aVcomes from the Copernican model,
p152
aVwhich ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.
p153
aVSo when Nicolaus Copernicus said,
p154
aVactually the Earth is not the center of the universe,
p155
aVthe sun is the center of the solar system,
p156
aVthe Earth moves around the sun.
p157
aVScientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true
p158
aVwe ought to be able to detect the motion
p159
aVof the Earth around the sun.
p160
aVAnd so this slide here illustrates a concept
p161
aVknown as stellar parallax.
p162
aVAnd astronomers said, if the Earth is moving
p163
aVand we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius \u2014
p164
aVwell I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars,
p165
aVbut imagine you're out in the country,  imagine you chose that rural life \u2014
p166
aVand we look at a star in December, we see that star
p167
aVagainst the backdrop of distant stars.
p168
aVIf we now make the same observation six months later
p169
aVwhen the Earth has moved to this position in June,
p170
aVwe look at that same star and we  see it against a different backdrop.
p171
aVThat difference, that angular difference, is the stellar parallax.
p172
aVSo this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.
p173
aVAstronomers looked for the stellar parallax
p174
aVand they found nothing, nothing at all.
p175
aVAnd many people argued that this proved  that the Copernican model was false.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo what happened?
p178
aVWell, in hindsight we can say  that astronomers were making
p179
aVtwo auxiliary hypotheses, both of which
p180
aVwe would now say were incorrect.
p181
aVThe first was an assumption  about the size of the Earth's orbit.
p182
aVAstronomers were assuming  that the Earth's orbit was large
p183
aVrelative to the distance to the stars.
p184
aVToday we would draw the picture more like this,
p185
aVthis comes from NASA,
p186
aVand you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.
p187
aVIn fact, it's actually much smaller even than shown here.
p188
aVThe stellar parallax therefore,
p189
aVis very small and actually very hard to detect.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd that leads to the second reason
p192
aVwhy the prediction didn't work,
p193
aVbecause scientists were also assuming
p194
aVthat the telescopes they had were sensitive enough
p195
aVto detect the parallax.
p196
aVAnd that turned out not to be true.
p197
aVIt wasn't until the 19th century
p198
aVthat scientists were able to detect
p199
aVthe stellar parallax.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo, there's a third problem as well.
p202
aVThe third problem is simply a factual problem,
p203
aVthat a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.
p204
aVA lot of science isn't deductive at all,
p205
aVit's actually inductive.
p206
aVAnd by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily
p207
aVstart with theories and hypotheses,
p208
aVoften they just start with observations
p209
aVof stuff going on in the world.
p210
aVAnd the most famous example of that is one of the most
p211
aVfamous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.
p212
aVWhen Darwin went out as a young  man on the voyage of the Beagle,
p213
aVhe didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.
p214
aVHe just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist
p215
aVand he started to collect data.
p216
aVMainly he knew that he hated medicine
p217
aVbecause the sight of blood made him sick so
p218
aVhe had to have an alternative career path.
p219
aVSo he started collecting data.
p220
aVAnd he collected many things,  including his famous finches.
p221
aVWhen he collected these finches, he threw them in a bag
p222
aVand he had no idea what they meant.
p223
aVMany years later back in London,
p224
aVDarwin looked at his data again and began
p225
aVto develop an explanation,
p226
aVand that explanation was the theory of natural selection.
p227
aa(lp228
VBesides inductive science,
p229
aVscientists also often participate in modeling.
p230
aVOne of the things scientists want to do in life
p231
aVis to explain the causes of things.
p232
aVAnd how do we do that?
p233
aVWell, one way you can do it is to build a model
p234
aVthat tests an idea.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo this is a picture of Henry Cadell,
p237
aVwho was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.
p238
aVYou can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing
p239
aVa deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVAnd Cadell wanted to answer the question,
p242
aVhow are mountains formed?
p243
aVAnd one of the things he had observed
p244
aVis that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians,
p245
aVyou often find that the rocks in them
p246
aVare folded,
p247
aVand they're folded in a particular way,
p248
aVwhich suggested to him
p249
aVthat they were actually being compressed from the side.
p250
aVAnd this idea would later play a major role
p251
aVin discussions of continental drift.
p252
aVSo he built this model, this crazy contraption
p253
aVwith levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,
p254
aVbuckets, a big sledgehammer.
p255
aVI don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.
p256
aVMaybe it's going to rain.
p257
aVAnd he created this physical model in order
p258
aVto demonstrate that you could, in fact, create
p259
aVpatterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,
p260
aVthat looked a lot like mountains
p261
aVif you compressed them from the side.
p262
aVSo it was an argument about the cause of mountains.
p263
aa(lp264
VNowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,
p265
aVso they don't build physical models so much
p266
aVas to make computer simulations.
p267
aVBut a computer simulation is a kind of a model.
p268
aVIt's a model that's made with mathematics,
p269
aVand like the physical models of the 19th century,
p270
aVit's very important for thinking about causes.
p271
aVSo one of the big questions to do with climate change,
p272
aVwe have tremendous amounts of evidence
p273
aVthat the Earth is warming up.
p274
aVThis slide here, the black line shows
p275
aVthe measurements that scientists have taken
p276
aVfor the last 150 years
p277
aVshowing that the Earth's temperature
p278
aVhas steadily increased,
p279
aVand you can see in particular that in the last 50 years
p280
aVthere's been this dramatic increase
p281
aVof nearly one degree centigrade,
p282
aVor almost two degrees Fahrenheit.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo what, though, is driving that change?
p285
aVHow can we know what's causing
p286
aVthe observed warming?
p287
aVWell, scientists can model it
p288
aVusing a computer simulation.
p289
aVSo this diagram illustrates a computer simulation
p290
aVthat has looked at all the different factors
p291
aVthat we know can influence the Earth's climate,
p292
aVso sulfate particles from air pollution,
p293
aVvolcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,
p294
aVchanges in solar radiation,
p295
aVand, of course, greenhouse gases.
p296
aVAnd they asked the question,
p297
aVwhat set of variables put into a model
p298
aVwill reproduce what we actually see in real life?
p299
aVSo here is the real life in black.
p300
aVHere's the model in this light gray,
p301
aVand the answer is
p302
aVa model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,
p303
aVall of the above.
p304
aVThe only way you can reproduce
p305
aVthe observed temperature measurements
p306
aVis with all of these things put together,
p307
aVincluding greenhouse gases,
p308
aVand in particular you can see that the increase
p309
aVin greenhouse gases tracks
p310
aVthis very dramatic increase in temperature
p311
aVover the last 50 years.
p312
aVAnd so this is why climate scientists say
p313
aVit's not just that we know that climate change is happening,
p314
aVwe know that greenhouse gases are a major part
p315
aVof the reason why.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo now because there all these different things
p318
aVthat scientists do,
p319
aVthe philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,
p320
aV"The only principle in science
p321
aVthat doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes."
p322
aVNow this quotation has often been taken out of context,
p323
aVbecause Feyerabend was not actually saying
p324
aVthat in science anything goes.
p325
aVWhat he was saying was,
p326
aVactually the full quotation is,
p327
aV"If you press me to say
p328
aVwhat is the method of science,
p329
aVI would have to say: anything goes."
p330
aVWhat he was trying to say
p331
aVis that scientists do a lot of different things.
p332
aVScientists are creative.
p333
aa(lp334
VBut then this pushes the question back:
p335
aVIf scientists don't use a single method,
p336
aVthen how do they decide
p337
aVwhat's right and what's wrong?
p338
aVAnd who judges?
p339
aVAnd the answer is, scientists judge,
p340
aVand they judge by judging evidence.
p341
aVScientists collect evidence in many different ways,
p342
aVbut however they collect it,
p343
aVthey have to subject it to scrutiny.
p344
aVAnd this led the sociologist Robert Merton
p345
aVto focus on this question of how scientists
p346
aVscrutinize data and evidence,
p347
aVand he said they do it in a way he called
p348
aV"organized skepticism."
p349
aVAnd by that he meant it's organized
p350
aVbecause they do it collectively,
p351
aVthey do it as a group,
p352
aVand skepticism, because they do it from a position
p353
aVof distrust.
p354
aVThat is to say, the burden of proof
p355
aVis on the person with a novel claim.
p356
aVAnd in this sense, science is intrinsically conservative.
p357
aVIt's quite hard to persuade the scientific community
p358
aVto say, "Yes, we know something, this is true."
p359
aVSo despite the popularity of the concept
p360
aVof paradigm shifts,
p361
aVwhat we find is that actually,
p362
aVreally major changes in scientific thinking
p363
aVare relatively rare in the history of science.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo finally that brings us to one more idea:
p366
aVIf scientists judge evidence collectively,
p367
aVthis has led historians to focus on the question
p368
aVof consensus,
p369
aVand to say that at the end of the day,
p370
aVwhat science is,
p371
aVwhat scientific knowledge is,
p372
aVis the consensus of the scientific experts
p373
aVwho through this process of organized scrutiny,
p374
aVcollective scrutiny,
p375
aVhave judged the evidence
p376
aVand come to a conclusion about it,
p377
aVeither yea or nay.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo we can think of scientific knowledge
p380
aVas a consensus of experts.
p381
aVWe can also think of science as being
p382
aVa kind of a jury,
p383
aVexcept it's a very special kind of jury.
p384
aVIt's not a jury of your peers,
p385
aVit's a jury of geeks.
p386
aVIt's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,
p387
aVand unlike a conventional jury,
p388
aVwhich has only two choices,
p389
aVguilty or not guilty,
p390
aVthe scientific jury actually has a number of choices.
p391
aVScientists can say yes, something's true.
p392
aVScientists can say no, it's false.
p393
aVOr, they can say, well it might be true
p394
aVbut we need to work more and collect more evidence.
p395
aVOr, they can say it might be true,
p396
aVbut we don't know how to answer the question
p397
aVand we're going to put it aside
p398
aVand maybe we'll come back to it later.
p399
aVThat's what scientists call "intractable."
p400
aa(lp401
VBut this leads us to one final problem:
p402
aVIf science is what scientists say it is,
p403
aVthen isn't that just an appeal to authority?
p404
aVAnd weren't we all taught in school
p405
aVthat the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?
p406
aVWell, here's the paradox of modern science,
p407
aVthe paradox of the conclusion I think historians
p408
aVand philosophers and sociologists have come to,
p409
aVthat actually science is the appeal to authority,
p410
aVbut it's not the authority of the individual,
p411
aVno matter how smart that individual is,
p412
aVlike Plato or Socrates or Einstein.
p413
aVIt's the authority of the collective community.
p414
aVYou can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,
p415
aVbut a very special kind of crowd.
p416
aVScience does appeal to authority,
p417
aVbut it's not based on any individual,
p418
aVno matter how smart that individual may be.
p419
aVIt's based on the collective wisdom,
p420
aVthe collective knowledge, the collective work,
p421
aVof all of the scientists who have worked
p422
aVon a particular problem.
p423
aVScientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,
p424
aVthis "show me" culture,
p425
aVillustrated by this nice woman here
p426
aVshowing her colleagues her evidence.
p427
aVOf course, these people don't really look like scientists,
p428
aVbecause they're much too happy.
p429
aV(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VOkay, so that brings me to my final point.
p432
aVMost of us get up in the morning.
p433
aVMost of us trust our cars.
p434
aVWell, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,
p435
aVthis is a bad analogy,
p436
aVbut most Americans who don't live in Manhattan
p437
aVget up in the morning and get in their cars
p438
aVand turn on that ignition, and their cars work,
p439
aVand they work incredibly well.
p440
aVThe modern automobile hardly ever breaks down.
p441
aa(lp442
VSo why is that? Why do cars work so well?
p443
aVIt's not because of the genius of Henry Ford
p444
aVor Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.
p445
aVIt's because the modern automobile
p446
aVis the product of more than 100 years of work
p447
aVby hundreds and thousands
p448
aVand tens of thousands of people.
p449
aVThe modern automobile is the product
p450
aVof the collected work and wisdom and experience
p451
aVof every man and woman who has ever worked
p452
aVon a car,
p453
aVand the reliability of the technology is the result
p454
aVof that accumulated effort.
p455
aVWe benefit not just from the genius of Benz
p456
aVand Ford and Musk
p457
aVbut from the collective intelligence and hard work
p458
