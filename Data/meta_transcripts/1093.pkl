VThis is a river.
p4
aVThis is a stream.
p5
aVThis is a river.
p6
aVThis is happening all over the country.
p7
aVThere are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.
p8
aVOn this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.
p9
aVSimilar problems are emerging in the East as well.
p10
aVThe reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
p11
aVThere are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
p12
aVThey would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
p13
aVThey're the veins of the ecosystem,
p14
aVand they're often empty veins.
p15
aa(lp16
VI want to tell you the story of just one of these streams,
p17
aVbecause it's an archetype for the larger story.
p18
aVThis is Prickly Pear Creek.
p19
aVIt runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
p20
aVIt supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.
p21
aVNearly every year for more than a hundred years ...
p22
aVit looked like this in the summer.
p23
aVHow did we get here?
p24
aVWell, it started back in the late 1800s
p25
aVwhen people started settling in places like Montana.
p26
aVIn short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
p27
aVBut as more people showed up wanting water,
p28
aVthe folks who were there first got a little concerned,
p29
aVand in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
p30
aVIt basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
p31
aVOddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream,
p32
aVand the folks who were there first
p33
aVgot concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
p34
aVThere were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872,
p35
aVboth involving Prickly Pear Creek.
p36
aVAnd in 1921,
p37
aVthe Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear
p38
aVthat the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."
p39
aVThese senior water rights are key.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe problem is that all over the West now it looks like this.
p42
aVSome of these creeks have claims
p43
aVfor 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.
p44
aVAnd the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right,
p45
aVthey risk losing their water right \u2014
p46
aValong with the economic value that goes with it.
p47
aVSo they have no incentive to conserve.
p48
aVSo it's not just about the number of people;
p49
aVthe system itself creates a disincentive to conserve
p50
aVbecause you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
p51
aVSo after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience,
p52
aVwe still have this.
p53
aVIt's a broken system.
p54
aVThere's a disincentive to conserve,
p55
aVbecause if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right.
p56
aVAnd I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts
p57
aVbetween the agricultural and environmental communities.
p58
aa(lp59
VOK, now I'm going to change gears here.
p60
aVMost of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ...
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
Vand some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VThere's another thing happening around the country,
p69
aVwhich is that companies are starting to get concerned
p70
aVabout their water footprint.
p71
aVThey're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water,
p72
aVthey're trying to be really efficient with their water use,
p73
aVand they're concerned about how their water use
p74
aVaffects the image of their brand.
p75
aVWell, it's a national problem,
p76
aVbut I'm going to tell you another story from Montana ...
p77
aVand it involves beer.
p78
aVI bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water
p79
aVto make a pint of beer.
p80
aVIf you include all the drain,
p81
aVit takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow the brewers in Montana
p84
aVhave already done a lot to reduce their water consumption,
p85
aVbut they still use millions of gallons of water.
p86
aVI mean, there's water in beer.
p87
aVSo what can they do about this remaining water footprint
p88
aVthat can have serious effects on the ecosystem?
p89
aVThese ecosystems are really important
p90
aVto the Montana brewers and their customers.
p91
aVAfter all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing,
p92
aVand for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VSo the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned
p97
aVand they're looking for some way to address the problem.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo how can they address this remaining water footprint?
p100
aVRemember Prickly Pear.
p101
aVUp until now, business water stewardship
p102
aVhas been limited to measuring and reducing,
p103
aVand we're suggesting that the next step is to restore.
p104
aVRemember Prickly Pear.
p105
aVIt's a broken system.
p106
aVYou've got a disincentive to conserve,
p107
aVbecause if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
p108
aVWell, we decided to connect these two worlds \u2014
p109
aVthe world of the companies with their water footprints
p110
aVand the world of the farmers
p111
aVwith their senior water rights on these creeks.
p112
aVIn some states,
p113
aVsenior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream
p114
aVwhile legally protecting it from others,
p115
aVand maintaining their water right.
p116
aVAfter all, it is their water right,
p117
aVand if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream,
p118
aVit's their right to do so.
p119
aVBut they have no incentive to do so.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.
p122
aVWe pay them to leave their water in stream.
p123
aVThat's what's happening here.
p124
aVThis individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion,
p125
aVleaving the water in the stream.
p126
aVHe doesn't lose the water right,
p127
aVhe just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it,
p128
aVto the stream, instead of to the land.
p129
aVBecause he's the senior water-rights holder,
p130
aVhe can protect the water from other users in the stream.
p131
aVOK?
p132
aVHe gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream.
p135
aVWe then take the measured water,
p136
aVwe divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
p137
aVEach increment gets a serial number and a certificate,
p138
aVand then the brewers and others buy those certificates
p139
aVas a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.
p140
aVThe brewers pay to restore water to the stream.
p141
aVIt provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way
p142
aVto return water to these degraded ecosystems,
p143
aVwhile giving farmers an economic choice
p144
aVand giving businesses concerned about their water footprints
p145
aVan easy way to deal with them.
p146
aa(lp147
VAfter 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams,
p148
aVa circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved,
p149
aVwe put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution \u2014
p150
aVa solution that does not require litigation.
p151
aVIt's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints
p152
aVa real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed,
p153
aVinto these degraded ecosystems,
p154
aVwhile at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice
p155
aVabout how their water is used.
p156
aa(lp157
VThese transactions create allies, not enemies.
p158
aVThey connect people rather than dividing them.
p159
aVAnd they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
p160
aVAnd most importantly, it's working.
p161
aVWe've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
p162
aVWe've connected senior water-rights holders
p163
aVwith brewers in Montana,
p164
aVwith hotels and tea companies in Oregon,
p165
aVand with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
p166
aVAnd when we make these connections,
p167
aVwe can and we do turn this ...
p168
aVinto this.
