VSo, basically we have public leaders,
p4
aVpublic officials who are out of control;
p5
aVthey are writing bills that are unintelligible,
p6
aVand out of these bills are going to come
p7
aVmaybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,
p8
aVwhich has a dramatically negative impact on our life.
p9
aVIf you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam
p10
aVyou face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;
p11
aVif you're trying to get a small business loan,
p12
aVyou face a blizzard of paperwork.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat are we going to do about it? I define simplicity
p15
aVas a means to achieving clarity,
p16
aVtransparency and empathy,
p17
aVbuilding humanity into communications.
p18
aVI've been simplifying things for 30 years.
p19
aVI come out of the advertising and design business.
p20
aVMy focus is understanding you people,
p21
aVand how you interact with the government
p22
aVto get your benefits,
p23
aVhow you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,
p24
aVand how you view brands.

VSo, very quickly, when President Obama said,
p27
aV"I don't see why we can't
p28
aVhave a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."
p29
aVSo, I locked myself in a room,
p30
aVfigured out the content,
p31
aVorganized the document, and wrote it in plain English.
p32
aVI've had this checked by the two top
p33
aVconsumer credit lawyers in the country.
p34
aVThis is a real thing.
p35
aVNow, I went one step further and said,
p36
aV"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers
p37
aVand just have a paper document? Let's go online."
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd many people
p40
aVmight need help in computation.
p41
aVWorking with the Harvard Business School,
p42
aVyou'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:
p43
aVIf you spent 62 dollars for a meal,
p44
aVthe longer you take to pay out that loan,
p45
aVyou see, over a period of time using the minimum payment
p46
aVit's 99 dollars and 17 cents.
p47
aVHow about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?
p48
aVBut it's going to work. It's more effective
p49
aVthan just computational aids.
p50
aVAnd what about terms like
p51
aV"over the limit"?
p52
aVPerhaps a stealth thing.
p53
aVDefine it in context. Tell people what it means.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhen you put it in plain English,
p56
aVyou almost force the institution
p57
aVto give the people a way, a default out of that,
p58
aVand not put themselves at risk.
p59
aVPlain English is about
p60
aVchanging the content.
p61
aVAnd one of the things I'm most proud of
p62
aVis this agreement for IBM.
p63
aVIt's a grid, it's a calendar.
p64
aVAt such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,
p65
aVyou have responsibilities.
p66
aVReceived very favorably by business.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd there is some good news to report today.
p69
aVEach year, one in 10 taxpayers
p70
aVreceives a notice from the IRS.
p71
aVThere are 200 million letters that go out.
p72
aVRunning through this typical letter that they had,
p73
aVI ran it through my simplicity lab,
p74
aVit's pretty unintelligible.
p75
aVAll the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
p76
aVWe looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover
p77
aV70 percent of their transactions in plain English.
p78
aVThey have been tested in the laboratory.
p79
aVWhen I run it through my lab,
p80
aVthis heat-mapping shows everything
p81
aVis intelligible.
p82
aVAnd the IRS has introduced the program.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VThere are a couple of things going on right now
p87
aVthat I want to bring to your attention.
p88
aVThere is a lot of discussion now
p89
aVabout a consumer financial protection agency,
p90
aVhow to mandate simplicity.
p91
aVWe see all this complexity.
p92
aVIt's incumbent upon us,
p93
aVand this organization, I believe,
p94
aVto make clarity, transparency
p95
aVand empathy a national priority.
p96
aVThere is no way that we should allow government
p97
aVto communicate the way they communicate.
p98
aVThere is no way we should do business
p99
aVwith companies that have agreements
p100
aVwith stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo, how are we going to change the world?
p103
aVMake clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.
p104
aVI thank you.
