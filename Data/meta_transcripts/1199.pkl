VWell after many years working in trade and economics,
p4
aVfour years ago,
p5
aVI found myself working on the front lines
p6
aVof human vulnerability.
p7
aVAnd I found myself in the places
p8
aVwhere people are fighting every day to survive
p9
aVand can't even obtain a meal.
p10
aVThis red cup comes from Rwanda
p11
aVfrom a child named Fabian.
p12
aVAnd I carry this around
p13
aVas a symbol, really, of the challenge
p14
aVand also the hope.
p15
aVBecause one cup of food a day
p16
aVchanges Fabian's life completely.
p17
aVBut what I'd like to talk about today
p18
aVis the fact that this morning,
p19
aVabout a billion people on Earth \u2014
p20
aVor one out of every seven \u2014
p21
aVwoke up and didn't even know
p22
aVhow to fill this cup.
p23
aVOne out of every seven people.
p24
aa(lp25
VFirst, I'll ask you: Why should you care?
p26
aVWhy should we care?
p27
aVFor most people,
p28
aVif they think about hunger,
p29
aVthey don't have to go far back on their own family history \u2014
p30
aVmaybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,
p31
aVor their grandparents' lives \u2014
p32
aVto remember an experience of hunger.
p33
aVI rarely find an audience
p34
aVwhere people can go back very far without that experience.
p35
aVSome are driven by compassion,
p36
aVfeel it's perhaps
p37
aVone of the fundamental acts of humanity.
p38
aVAs Gandhi said,
p39
aV"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."
p40
aVOthers worry about peace and security,
p41
aVstability in the world.
p42
aVWe saw the food riots in 2008,
p43
aVafter what I call the silent tsunami of hunger
p44
aVswept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.
p45
aVThe destabilizing effects of hunger
p46
aVare known throughout human history.
p47
aVOne of the most fundamental acts of civilization
p48
aVis to ensure people can get enough food.
p49
aa(lp50
VOthers think about Malthusian nightmares.
p51
aVWill we be able to feed a population
p52
aVthat will be nine billion in just a few decades?
p53
aVThis is not a negotiable thing, hunger.
p54
aVPeople have to eat.
p55
aVThere's going to be a lot of people.
p56
aVThis is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.
p57
aVBut I actually came to this issue
p58
aVin a different way.
p59
aVThis is a picture of me and my three children.
p60
aVIn 1987, I was a new mother
p61
aVwith my first child
p62
aVand was holding her and feeding her
p63
aVwhen an image very similar to this
p64
aVcame on the television.
p65
aVAnd this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.
p66
aVOne two years earlier
p67
aVhad killed more than a million people.
p68
aVBut it never struck me as it did that moment,
p69
aVbecause on that image
p70
aVwas a woman trying to nurse her baby,
p71
aVand she had no milk to nurse.
p72
aVAnd the baby's cry really penetrated me,
p73
aVas a mother.
p74
aVAnd I thought, there's nothing more haunting
p75
aVthan the cry of a child
p76
aVthat cannot be returned with food \u2014
p77
aVthe most fundamental expectation of every human being.
p78
aVAnd it was at that moment
p79
aVthat I just was filled
p80
aVwith the challenge and the outrage
p81
aVthat actually we know how to fix this problem.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis isn't one of those rare diseases
p84
aVthat we don't have the solution for.
p85
aVWe know how to fix hunger.
p86
aVA hundred years ago, we didn't.
p87
aVWe actually have the technology and systems.
p88
aVAnd I was just struck
p89
aVthat this is out of place.
p90
aVAt our time in history, these images are out of place.
p91
aVWell guess what?
p92
aVThis is last week in northern Kenya.
p93
aVYet again,
p94
aVthe face of starvation
p95
aVat large scale
p96
aVwith more than nine million people
p97
aVwondering if they can make it to the next day.
p98
aVIn fact,
p99
aVwhat we know now
p100
aVis that every 10 seconds
p101
aVwe lose a child to hunger.
p102
aVThis is more
p103
aVthan HIV/AIDS,
p104
aVmalaria and tuberculosis combined.
p105
aVAnd we know that the issue
p106
aVis not just production of food.
p107
aa(lp108
VOne of my mentors in life
p109
aVwas Norman Borlaug, my hero.
p110
aVBut today I'm going to talk about access to food,
p111
aVbecause actually this year and last year
p112
aVand during the 2008 food crisis,
p113
aVthere was enough food on Earth
p114
aVfor everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.
p115
aVSo why is it
p116
aVthat we have a billion people
p117
aVwho can't find food?
p118
aVAnd I also want to talk about
p119
aVwhat I call our new burden of knowledge.
p120
aVIn 2008,
p121
aVLancet compiled all the research
p122
aVand put forward the compelling evidence
p123
aVthat if a child in its first thousand days \u2014
p124
aVfrom conception to two years old \u2014
p125
aVdoes not have adequate nutrition,
p126
aVthe damage is irreversible.
p127
aVTheir brains and bodies will be stunted.
p128
aVAnd here you see a brain scan of two children \u2014
p129
aVone who had adequate nutrition,
p130
aVanother, neglected
p131
aVand who was deeply malnourished.
p132
aVAnd we can see brain volumes
p133
aVup to 40 percent less
p134
aVin these children.
p135
aVAnd in this slide
p136
aVyou see the neurons and the synapses of the brain
p137
aVdon't form.
p138
aVAnd what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,
p139
aVwhich I'll talk about later.
p140
aVBut also the earning potential of these children
p141
aVis cut in half in their lifetime
p142
aVdue to the stunting
p143
aVthat happens in early years.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo this burden of knowledge drives me.
p146
aVBecause actually we know how to fix it
p147
aVvery simply.
p148
aVAnd yet, in many places,
p149
aVa third of the children,
p150
aVby the time they're three
p151
aValready are facing a life of hardship
p152
aVdue to this.
p153
aVI'd like to talk about
p154
aVsome of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,
p155
aVsome of the things I've learned
p156
aVin bringing my economic and trade knowledge
p157
aVand my experience in the private sector.
p158
aVI'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.
p159
aa(lp160
VWell first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,
p161
aVbreastfeeding.
p162
aVYou may be surprised to know
p163
aVthat a child could be saved every 22 seconds
p164
aVif there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.
p165
aVBut in Niger, for example,
p166
aVless than seven percent of the children
p167
aVare breastfed
p168
aVfor the first six months of life, exclusively.
p169
aVIn Mauritania, less than three percent.
p170
aVThis is something that can be transformed with knowledge.
p171
aVThis message, this word, can come out
p172
aVthat this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;
p173
aVit's a brilliant way
p174
aVof saving your child's life.
p175
aVAnd so today we focus on not just passing out food,
p176
aVbut making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,
p177
aVand teaching them about breastfeeding.
p178
aa(lp179
VThe second thing I'd like to talk about:
p180
aVIf you were living in a remote village somewhere,
p181
aVyour child was limp,
p182
aVand you were in a drought, or you were in floods,
p183
aVor you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,
p184
aVwhat would you do?
p185
aVDo you think you could go to the store
p186
aVand get a choice of power bars, like we can,
p187
aVand pick the right one to match?
p188
aVWell I find parents out on the front lines
p189
aVvery aware their children are going down for the count.
p190
aVAnd I go to those shops, if there are any,
p191
aVor out to the fields to see what they can get,
p192
aVand they cannot obtain the nutrition.
p193
aVEven if they know what they need to do, it's not available.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd I'm very excited about this,
p196
aVbecause one thing we're working on
p197
aVis transforming the technologies
p198
aVthat are very available
p199
aVin the food industry
p200
aVto be available for traditional crops.
p201
aVAnd this is made with chickpeas, dried milk
p202
aVand a host of vitamins,
p203
aVmatched to exactly what the brain needs.
p204
aVIt costs 17 cents for us to produce this
p205
aVas, what I call, food for humanity.
p206
aVWe did this with food technologists
p207
aVin India and Pakistan \u2014
p208
aVreally about three of them.
p209
aVBut this is transforming
p210
aV99 percent of the kids who get this.
p211
aVOne package, 17 cents a day \u2014
p212
aVtheir malnutrition is overcome.
p213
aVSo I am convinced
p214
aVthat if we can unlock the technologies
p215
aVthat are commonplace in the richer world
p216
aVto be able to transform foods.
p217
aVAnd this is climate-proof.
p218
aVIt doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,
p219
aVwhich is often lacking.
p220
aVAnd these types of technologies,
p221
aVI see, have the potential
p222
aVto transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition
p223
aVout on the front lines.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.
p226
aVEighty percent of the people in the world
p227
aVhave no food safety net.
p228
aVWhen disaster strikes \u2014
p229
aVthe economy gets blown, people lose a job,
p230
aVfloods, war, conflict,
p231
aVbad governance, all of those things \u2014
p232
aVthere is nothing to fall back on.
p233
aVAnd usually the institutions \u2014
p234
aVchurches, temples, other things \u2014
p235
aVdo not have the resources
p236
aVto provide a safety net.
p237
aVWhat we have found working with the World Bank
p238
aVis that the poor man's safety net,
p239
aVthe best investment, is school feeding.
p240
aVAnd if you fill the cup
p241
aVwith local agriculture from small farmers,
p242
aVyou have a transformative effect.
p243
aVMany kids in the world can't go to school
p244
aVbecause they have to go beg and find a meal.
p245
aVBut when that food is there,
p246
aVit's transformative.
p247
aVIt costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut what is most amazing is the effect on girls.
p250
aVIn countries where girls don't go to school
p251
aVand you offer a meal to girls in school,
p252
aVwe see enrollment rates
p253
aVabout 50 percent girls and boys.
p254
aVWe see a transformation in attendance by girls.
p255
aVAnd there was no argument,
p256
aVbecause it's incentive.
p257
aVFamilies need the help.
p258
aVAnd we find that if we keep girls in school later,
p259
aVthey'll stay in school until they're 16,
p260
aVand won't get married if there's food in school.
p261
aVOr if they get an extra ration of food
p262
aVat the end of the week \u2014
p263
aVit costs about 50 cents \u2014
p264
aVwill keep a girl in school,
p265
aVand they'll give birth to a healthier child,
p266
aVbecause the malnutrition is sent
p267
aVgeneration to generation.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.
p270
aVWe know this.
p271
aVRight now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.
p272
aVSo is this a hopeless cause?
p273
aVAbsolutely not.
p274
aVI'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
p275
aVCameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger
p276
aVevery year for decades.
p277
aVFood aid coming in every year
p278
aVwhen people are starving during the lean seasons.
p279
aVWell two years ago,
p280
aVwe decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,
p281
aVand instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.
p282
aVAnd we said, listen,
p283
aVduring the lean season, take the food out.
p284
aVYou manage, the village manages these warehouses.
p285
aVAnd during harvest, put it back with interest,
p286
aVfood interest.
p287
aVSo add in five percent, 10 percent more food.
p288
aVFor the past two years,
p289
aV500 of these villages where these are
p290
aVhave not needed any food aid \u2014 they're self-sufficient.
p291
aVAnd the food banks are growing.
p292
aVAnd they're starting school feeding programs for their children
p293
aVby the people in the village.
p294
aVBut they've never had the ability
p295
aVto build even the basic infrastructure
p296
aVor the resources.
p297
aVI love this idea that came from the village level:
p298
aVthree keys to unlock that warehouse.
p299
aVFood is gold there.
p300
aVAnd simple ideas can transform the face,
p301
aVnot of small areas,
p302
aVof big areas of the world.
p303
aa(lp304
VI'd like to talk about what I call digital food.
p305
aVTechnology is transforming
p306
aVthe face of food vulnerability
p307
aVin places where you see classic famine.
p308
aVAmartya Sen won his Nobel Prize
p309
aVfor saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food
p310
aVbecause people have no ability to buy it."
p311
aVWe certainly saw that in 2008.
p312
aVWe're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa
p313
aVwhere food prices are up 240 percent in some areas
p314
aVover last year.
p315
aVFood can be there and people can't buy it.
p316
aa(lp317
VWell this picture \u2014 I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,
p318
aVwhere instead of bringing in food,
p319
aVwe provide digital food, a card.
p320
aVIt says "bon appetit" in Arabic.
p321
aVAnd the women can go in and swipe
p322
aVand get nine food items.
p323
aVThey have to be nutritious,
p324
aVand they have to be locally produced.
p325
aVAnd what's happened in the past year alone
p326
aVis the dairy industry \u2014
p327
aVwhere this card's used for milk and yogurt
p328
aVand eggs and hummus \u2014
p329
aVthe dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.
p330
aVThe shopkeepers are hiring more people.
p331
aVIt is a win-win-win situation
p332
aVthat starts the food economy moving.
p333
aVWe now deliver food in over 30 countries
p334
aVover cell phones,
p335
aVtransforming even the presence of refugees in countries,
p336
aVand other ways.
p337
aa(lp338
VPerhaps most exciting to me
p339
aVis an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others
p340
aVhave supported boldly,
p341
aVwhich is to ask the question:
p342
aVWhat if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims \u2014
p343
aVand most of them are small farmers
p344
aVwho cannot raise enough food or sell food
p345
aVto even support their own families \u2014
p346
aVwhat if we view them as the solution,
p347
aVas the value chain to fight hunger?
p348
aVWhat if from the women in Africa
p349
aVwho cannot sell any food \u2014
p350
aVthere's no roads, there's no warehouses,
p351
aVthere's not even a tarp to pick the food up with \u2014
p352
aVwhat if we give the enabling environment
p353
aVfor them to provide the food
p354
aVto feed the hungry children elsewhere?
p355
aVAnd Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.
p356
aVAnd guess what?
p357
aVIn virtually every case,
p358
aVwhen poor farmers are given a guaranteed market \u2014
p359
aVif you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.
p360
aVWe'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." \u2014
p361
aVtheir yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold
p362
aVand they figure it out,
p363
aVbecause it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.
p364
aVAnd we're seeing people transform their lives.
p365
aVToday, food aid, our food aid \u2014
p366
aVhuge engine \u2014
p367
aV80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
p368
aVTotal transformation
p369
aVthat can actually transform the very lives that need the food.
p370
aa(lp371
VNow you'd ask, can this be done at scale?
p372
aVThese are great ideas, village-level ideas.
p373
aVWell I'd like to talk about Brazil,
p374
aVbecause I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,
p375
aVwhen I read that Brazil was defeating hunger
p376
aVfaster than any nation on Earth right now.
p377
aVAnd what I've found is,
p378
aVrather than investing their money in food subsidies
p379
aVand other things,
p380
aVthey invested in a school feeding program.
p381
aVAnd they require that a third of that food
p382
aVcome from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
p383
aVAnd they're doing this at huge scale
p384
aVafter President Lula declared his goal
p385
aVof ensuring everyone had three meals a day.
p386
aVAnd this zero hunger program
p387
aVcosts .5 percent of GDP
p388
aVand has lifted many millions of people
p389
aVout of hunger and poverty.
p390
aVIt is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,
p391
aVand it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
p392
aVI've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers
p393
aVwho have built their livelihoods
p394
aVon the opportunity and platform
p395
aVprovided by this.
p396
aa(lp397
VNow if we look at the economic imperative here,
p398
aVthis isn't just about compassion.
p399
aVThe fact is studies show
p400
aVthat the cost of malnutrition and hunger \u2014
p401
aVthe cost to society,
p402
aVthe burden it has to bear \u2014
p403
aVis on average six percent,
p404
aVand in some countries up to 11 percent,
p405
aVof GDP a year.
p406
aVAnd if you look at the 36 countries
p407
aVwith the highest burden of malnutrition,
p408
aVthat's 260 billion lost from a productive economy
p409
aVevery year.
p410
aVWell, the World Bank estimates
p411
aVit would take about 10 billion dollars \u2014
p412
aV10.3 \u2014
p413
aVto address malnutrition in those countries.
p414
aVYou look at the cost-benefit analysis,
p415
aVand my dream is to take this issue,
p416
aVnot just from the compassion argument,
p417
aVbut to the finance ministers of the world,
p418
aVand say we cannot afford
p419
aVto not invest
p420
aVin the access to adequate, affordable nutrition
p421
aVfor all of humanity.
p422
aa(lp423
VThe amazing thing I've found
p424
aVis nothing can change on a big scale
p425
aVwithout the determination of a leader.
p426
aVWhen a leader says, "Not under my watch,"
p427
aVeverything begins to change.
p428
aVAnd the world can come in
p429
aVwith enabling environments and opportunities to do this.
p430
aVAnd the fact that France
p431
aVhas put food at the center of the G20
p432
aVis really important.
p433
aVBecause food is one issue
p434
aVthat cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.
p435
aVWe have to stand together.
p436
aVAnd we're seeing nations in Africa.
p437
aVWFP's been able to leave 30 nations
p438
aVbecause they have transformed
p439
aVthe face of hunger in their nations.
p440
aa(lp441
VWhat I would like to offer here is a challenge.
p442
aVI believe we're living at a time in human history
p443
aVwhere it's just simply unacceptable
p444
aVthat children wake up
p445
aVand don't know where to find a cup of food.
p446
aVNot only that,
p447
aVtransforming hunger
p448
aVis an opportunity,
p449
aVbut I think we have to change our mindsets.
p450
aVI am so honored to be here
p451
aVwith some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
p452
aVAnd I would like you to join with all of humanity
p453
aVto draw a line in the sand
p454
aVand say, "No more.
p455
aVNo more are we going to accept this."
p456
aVAnd we want to tell our grandchildren
p457
aVthat there was a terrible time in history
p458
aVwhere up to a third of the children
p459
aVhad brains and bodies that were stunted,
p460
aVbut that exists no more.
