VPhyllis Rodriguez: We are here today
p4
aVbecause of the fact
p5
aVthat we have what most people consider
p6
aVan unusual friendship.
p7
aVAnd it is.
p8
aVAnd yet, it feels natural to us now.
p9
aa(lp10
VI first learned
p11
aVthat my son had been in the World Trade Center
p12
aVon the morning of September 11th, 2001.
p13
aVWe didn't know
p14
aVif he had perished yet
p15
aVuntil 36 hours later.
p16
aVAt the time,
p17
aVwe knew that it was political.
p18
aVWe were afraid of what our country was going to do
p19
aVin the name of our son \u2014
p20
aVmy husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
p21
aVAnd when I saw it \u2014
p22
aVand yet, through the shock,
p23
aVthe terrible shock,
p24
aVand the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,
p25
aVwe were not vengeful.
p26
aVAnd a couple of weeks later
p27
aVwhen Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted
p28
aVon six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,
p29
aVand the U.S. government called for a death penalty
p30
aVfor him, if convicted,
p31
aVmy husband and I spoke out
p32
aVin opposition to that, publicly.
p33
aVThrough that
p34
aVand through human rights groups,
p35
aVwe were brought together
p36
aVwith several other victims' families.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhen I saw Aicha in the media,
p39
aVcoming over when her son was indicted,
p40
aVand I thought, "What a brave woman.
p41
aVSomeday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
p42
aVI was still in deep grief;
p43
aVI knew I didn't have the strength.
p44
aVI knew I would find her someday,
p45
aVor we would find each other.
p46
aVBecause, when people heard that my son was a victim,
p47
aVI got immediate sympathy.
p48
aVBut when people learned
p49
aVwhat her son was accused of,
p50
aVshe didn't get that sympathy.
p51
aVBut her suffering is equal to mine.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we met in November 2002,
p54
aVand Aicha will now tell you
p55
aVhow that came about.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
p58
aVI am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
p59
aVAnd I asked
p60
aVthe Organization of Human Rights
p61
aVto put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
p62
aVSo they introduced me
p63
aVto five families.
p64
aVAnd I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
p65
aVShe was the only mother in the group.
p66
aVThe others were brothers, sisters.
p67
aVAnd I saw in her eyes
p68
aVthat she was a mother, just like me.
p69
aVI suffered a lot as a mother.
p70
aVI was married when I was 14.
p71
aVI lost a child when I was 15,
p72
aVa second child when I was 16.
p73
aVSo the story with Zacarias was too much really.
p74
aVAnd I still suffer,
p75
aVbecause my son
p76
aVis like he's buried alive.
p77
aVI know she really cried for her son.
p78
aVBut she knows where he is.
p79
aVMy son, I don't know where he is.
p80
aVI don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
p81
aVI don't know what happened to him.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo that's why I decided to tell my story,
p84
aVso that my suffering is something positive for other women.
p85
aVFor all the women, all the mothers that give life,
p86
aVyou can give back,
p87
aVyou can change.
p88
aVIt's up to us women,
p89
aVbecause we are women,
p90
aVbecause we love our children.
p91
aVWe must be hand-in-hand
p92
aVand do something together.
p93
aVIt's not against women,
p94
aVit's for us, for us women,
p95
aVfor our children.
p96
aVI talk against violence, against terrorism.
p97
aVI go to schools
p98
aVto talk to young, Muslim girls
p99
aVso they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
p100
aVSo if I can save one of the young girls,
p101
aVand avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,
p102
aVwell this is something good.
p103
aVThis is why I'm here in front of you.
p104
aa(lp105
VPR: I would like to say
p106
aVthat I have learned so much from Aicha,
p107
aVstarting with that day we had our very first meeting
p108
aVwith other family members \u2014
p109
aVwhich was a very private meeting with security,
p110
aVbecause it was November 2002,
p111
aVand, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country \u2014
p112
aVthose of us family members.
p113
aVBut we were all so nervous.
p114
aV"Why does she want to meet us?"
p115
aVAnd then she was nervous.
p116
aV"Why did we want to meet her?"
p117
aVWhat did we want from each other?
p118
aVBefore we knew each others' names, or anything,
p119
aVwe had embraced and wept.
p120
aVThen we sat in a circle
p121
aVwith support, with help,
p122
aVfrom people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
p123
aVAnd Aicha started,
p124
aVand she said,
p125
aV"I don't know if my son
p126
aVis guilty or innocent,
p127
aVbut I want to tell you how sorry I am
p128
aVfor what happened to your families.
p129
aVI know what it is to suffer,
p130
aVand I feel that if there is a crime,
p131
aVa person should be tried fairly and punished."
p132
aVBut she reached out to us in that way,
p133
aVand it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
p134
aVAnd what happened then is we all told our stories,
p135
aVand we all connected as human beings.
p136
aVBy the end of the afternoon \u2014
p137
aVit was about three hours after lunch \u2014
p138
aVwe'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow what I learned from her,
p141
aVis a woman, not only who could be so generous
p142
aVunder these present circumstances
p143
aVand what it was then,
p144
aVand what was being done to her son,
p145
aVbut the life she's had.
p146
aVI never had met
p147
aVsomeone with such a hard life,
p148
aVfrom such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
p149
aVAnd I feel
p150
aVthat we have
p151
aVa special connection,
p152
aVwhich I value very much.
p153
aVAnd I think it's all about
p154
aVbeing afraid of the other,
p155
aVbut making that step
p156
aVand then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
p157
aVWho else can I meet that I don't know,
p158
aVor that I'm so different from?"
p159
aa(lp160
VSo, Aicha,
p161
aVdo you have a couple of words
p162
aVfor conclusion?
p163
aVBecause our time is up.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
V(Translator) AW: I wanted to say
p168
aVthat we have to try to know other people, the other.
p169
aVYou have to be generous,
p170
aVand your hearts must be generous,
p171
aVyour mind must be generous.
p172
aVYou must be tolerant.
p173
aVYou have to fight against violence.
p174
aVAnd I hope that someday we'll all live together
p175
aVin peace and respecting each other.
p176
aVThis is what I wanted to say.
