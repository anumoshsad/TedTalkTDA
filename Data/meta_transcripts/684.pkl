VI'd like to ask you,
p4
aVwhat do these three people have in common?
p5
aVWell, you probably recognize the first person.
p6
aVI'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.
p7
aVBut you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,
p8
aVwho is a contestant, indeed a finalist,
p9
aVin the Poet of the Millions competition,
p10
aVwhich is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,
p11
aVand seen throughout the Arab world.
p12
aVIn this contest
p13
aVpeople have to write and recite
p14
aVoriginal poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,
p15
aVwhich is the traditional Bedouin form.
p16
aVAnd Lima Sahar was a finalist
p17
aVin the Afghan Star singing competition.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, before I go any further,
p20
aVyes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."
p21
aVBut my point in discussing this
p22
aVis to show you \u2014 I hope I'll be able to show you
p23
aVhow these merit-based competitions,
p24
aVwith equal access to everyone,
p25
aVwith the winner selected via voting by SMS,
p26
aVare changing tribal societies.
p27
aVAnd I'm going to focus on Afghanistan
p28
aVand the Arab world with the UAE,
p29
aVhow they're changing tribal societies,
p30
aVnot by introducing Western ideas,
p31
aVbut by being integrated into the language in those places.
p32
aa(lp33
VIt all begins with enjoyment.
p34
aVVideo: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."
p35
aVWe are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.
p36
aVWe are running late.
p37
aVWe must go to watch "Afghan Star."
p38
aVCynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.
p39
aVIn Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths
p40
aVto be able to watch this program.
p41
aVAnd you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.
p42
aVPeople watch it all over the country
p43
aValso in public places.
p44
aVBut it goes beyond watching,
p45
aVbecause also, part of this
p46
aVis campaigning.
p47
aVPeople become so engaged
p48
aVthat they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,
p49
aVwho fan out over the countryside,
p50
aVcampaigning for their candidate.
p51
aVContestants also put themselves forward.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.
p54
aVBecause each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.
p55
aVThis has opened up the door,
p56
aVparticularly for women.
p57
aVAnd in the last season there were two women in the finalists.
p58
aVOne of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,
p59
aVa very conservative part of the country.
p60
aVAnd here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"
p61
aVhow her friends urged her not to do this
p62
aVand told her that she was leaving them for democracy.
p63
aVBut she also confides that
p64
aVshe knows that members of the Taliban
p65
aVare actually SMS-ing votes in for her.
p66
aa(lp67
VAydah Al Jahnani also took risks
p68
aVand put herself out, to compete
p69
aVin the Poet of the Millions competition.
p70
aVI have to say, her husband backed her from the start.
p71
aVBut her tribe and family urged her not to compete
p72
aVand were very much against it.
p73
aVBut, once she started to win,
p74
aVthen they got behind her again.
p75
aVIt turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.
p76
aVAnd she's out there.
p77
aVHer poetry is about women,
p78
aVand the life of women in society.
p79
aVSo just by presenting herself
p80
aVand being in competition with men \u2014
p81
aVthis shows the voting on the program \u2014
p82
aVit sets a very important example for young women \u2014
p83
aVthese are young women in the audience of the program \u2014
p84
aVin Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow you'd think that "American Idol"
p87
aVwould introduce a measure of Americanization.
p88
aVBut actually, just the opposite is happening.
p89
aVBy using this engaging popular format
p90
aVfor traditional, local culture,
p91
aVit actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival
p92
aVof interest in Nabati poetry,
p93
aValso in traditional dress and dance and music.
p94
aVAnd for Afghanistan,
p95
aVwhere the Taliban banned music for many years,
p96
aVit is reintroducing their traditional music.
p97
aVThey don't sing pop songs,
p98
aVthey sing Afghan music.
p99
aVAnd they also have learned how to lose gracefully,
p100
aVwithout avenging the winner.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVNo small thing.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd the final, sort of, formulation
p105
aVof this "American Idol" format,
p106
aVwhich has just appeared in Afghanistan,
p107
aVis a new program called "The Candidate."
p108
aVAnd in this program, people present
p109
aVpolicy platforms that are then voted on.
p110
aVMany of them are too young to run for president,
p111
aVbut by putting the issues out there,
p112
aVthey are influencing the presidential race.
p113
aVSo for me, the substance of things unseen
p114
aVis how reality TV is driving reality.
p115
aVThank you.
