VSome of the greatest innovations
p4
aVand developments in the world
p5
aVoften happen at the intersection of two fields.
p6
aVSo tonight I'd like to tell you
p7
aVabout the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,
p8
aVwhich is entertainment and robotics.
p9
aVSo if we're trying to make robots
p10
aVthat can be more expressive
p11
aVand that can connect better with us in society,
p12
aVmaybe we should look to some of the human professionals
p13
aVof artificial emotion and personality
p14
aVthat occur in the dramatic arts.
p15
aVI'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts
p16
aVand to attract people
p17
aVto science and technology.
p18
aVSome people in the last decade or two
p19
aVhave started creating artwork with technology.
p20
aVWith my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,
p21
aVI would like to use art to create tech.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we're based in New York City.
p26
aVAnd if you're a performer that wants to collaborate
p27
aVwith an adorable robot,
p28
aVor if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,
p29
aVplease contact me, the Bot-Agent.
p30
aVThe bot, our rising celebrity,
p31
aValso has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.
p32
aVI'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.
p33
aVHe's named after the Star Trek character.
p34
aVI think he's going to be super popular.
p35
aVWe've got the robot \u2014
p36
aVin his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
p37
aVNow each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
p38
aVSo it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
p39
aVIt knows how much it's moving.
p40
aVAnd so it's going to try to watch your response.
p41
aVI actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VIt can also learn from you
p46
aVabout the quality of its jokes
p47
aVand cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,
p48
aVover longer-term
p49
aVto different communities or audiences,
p50
aVchildren versus adults, different cultures.
p51
aVYou can learn something from the robot
p52
aVabout the community that you're in.
p53
aVAnd also I can use each one of you as the acting coach
p54
aVto our future robot companions.
p55
aVSome of you in this middle section \u2014
p56
aVyou have red/green paddles.
p57
aVIf you like what's going on,
p58
aVshow the green.
p59
aVIf you don't like the subject or the performance,
p60
aVyou can hold the red.
p61
aVNow don't be shy.
p62
aVIt's just a robot.
p63
aVIt doesn't have feelings ... yet.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVAnd the rest of you,
p66
aVyou still count, you still matter.
p67
aVThere's also a microphone
p68
aVthat's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause
p69
aVand booing \u2014 I hope not \u2014
p70
aVto help make some of its next decisions.
p71
aVRight, so,
p72
aVlet the robot stand-up comedy begin.
p73
aa(lp74
VData: Hello TEDWomen.
p75
aVIt's an honor to be here.

p87
aVRight, so,
p88
aVa doctor says to his patient,
p89
aV"I have bad news and worse news.
p90
aVThe bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."
p91
aV"That's terrible," said the patient.
p92
aV"How can the news possibly be worse?"
p93
aV"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."
p94

p104

p115
aVThe other guy whips out his cell phone
p116
aVand calls 911.
p117
aVHe gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.
p118
aVWhat can I do?"
p119
aVThe operator says, "Just take it easy.
p120

p121
aVFirst, let's make sure he's dead."
p122
aVThere is a silence,
p123
aVand the operator hears a shot.
p124
aVThe guy's voice comes back on the line,
p125
aV"Okay, now what?"

VQuestion: Why is television called a medium?
p132
aVAnyone?
p133
aVBecause it's neither rare nor well done.
p134
aVBut to be completely honest with you,
p135
aVI kind of love television.
p136
aVAny of you like television? Audience: Yes.
p137
aVData: I find it incredibly educational.
p138
aVActually, as soon as someone turns it on,
p139
aVI go into the other room and read.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141

p155
aVSo thank you all for being a part of it.
p156
aVThere's a lot more to come.
