VI'm going to talk about hackers.
p4
aVAnd the image that comes to your mind
p5
aVwhen I say that word is probably not
p6
aVof Benjamin Franklin,
p7
aVbut I'm going to explain to you why it should be.
p8
aa(lp9
VThe image that comes to your mind
p10
aVis probably more likely of a pasty kid
p11
aVsitting in a basement doing something mischievous,
p12
aVor of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity,
p13
aVor of an international rogue
p14
aVwith a political agenda.
p15
aVAnd mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea
p16
aVthat hackers are people that we should be afraid of.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut like most things in technology
p19
aVand the technology world,
p20
aVhacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.
p21
aVFor every hacker that's trying to steal your identity
p22
aVthere's one that's building a tool
p23
aVthat will help you find your loved ones after a disaster
p24
aVor to monitor environmental quality
p25
aVafter an oil spill.
p26
aVHacking is really just any amateur innovation
p27
aVon an existing system,
p28
aVand it is a deeply democratic activity.
p29
aVIt's about critical thinking.
p30
aVIt's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
p31
aVIt's the idea that if you see a  problem, you work to fix it,
p32
aVand not just complain about it.
p33
aVAnd in many ways, hacking is what built America.
p34
aVBetsy Ross was a hacker.
p35
aVThe Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.
p36
aVAnd from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,
p37
aVhacking has always been at the foundation
p38
aVof American democracy.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today,
p41
aVit's that the next time you think about who a hacker is,
p42
aVyou think not of this guy
p43
aVbut of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,
p44
aVwho was one of the greatest hackers of all time.
p45
aVHe was one of America's most prolific inventors,
p46
aVthough he famously never filed a patent,
p47
aVbecause he thought that all human knowledge
p48
aVshould be freely available.
p49
aVHe brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,
p50
aVand of course there was his collaboration
p51
aVon the invention of American democracy.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd in Code For America, we really try to embody
p54
aVthe spirit of Ben Franklin.
p55
aVHe was a tinkerer and a statesman
p56
aVwhose conception of citizenship
p57
aVwas always predicated on action.
p58
aVHe believed that government could be built
p59
aVby the people,
p60
aVand we call those people civic hackers.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo it's no wonder that the values
p63
aVthat underly a healthy democracy,
p64
aVlike collaboration and empowerment
p65
aVand participation and enterprise,
p66
aVare the same values that underly the Internet.
p67
aVAnd so it's no surprise that many hackers
p68
aVare turning their attention to the problem of government.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut before I give you a few examples
p71
aVof what civic hacking looks like,
p72
aVI want to make clear that you don't have
p73
aVto be a programmer to be a civic hacker.
p74
aVYou just have to believe that you can bring
p75
aVa 21st-century tool set to bear
p76
aVon the problems that government faces.
p77
aVAnd we hear all the time from our community
p78
aVof civic hackers at Code for America
p79
aVthat they didn't understand how much nontechnical work
p80
aVactually went into civic hacking projects.
p81
aVSo keep that in mind.
p82
aVAll of you are potential civic hackers.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo what does civic hacking look like?
p85
aVOur team last year in Honolulu,
p86
aVwhich in this case was three full-time fellows
p87
aVwho were doing a year of public service,
p88
aVwere asked by the city to rebuild the website.
p89
aVAnd it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages
p90
aVwhich just wasn't going to be possible
p91
aVin the few months that they had.
p92
aVSo instead, they decided to build a parallel site
p93
aVthat better conformed to how citizens actually
p94
aVwant to interact with information on a city website.
p95
aVThey're looking for answers to questions,
p96
aVand they want to take action when they're done,
p97
aVwhich is really hard to do from a site
p98
aVthat looks like this.
p99
aVSo our team built Honolulu Answers,
p100
aVwhich is a super-simple search interface
p101
aVwhere you enter a search term or a question
p102
aVand get back plain language answers
p103
aVthat drive a user towards action.
p104
aVNow the site itself was easy enough to build,
p105
aVbut the team was faced with the challenge
p106
aVof how they populate all of the content.
p107
aVIt would have taken the three of them
p108
aVa very long time,
p109
aVespecially given that none of  them are actually from Honolulu.
p110
aVAnd so they did something that's really radical,
p111
aVwhen you think about how government
p112
aVis used to working.
p113
aVThey asked citizens to write the content.
p114
aVSo you've heard of a hack-a-thon.
p115
aVThey held a write-a-thon,
p116
aVwhere on one Saturday afternoon \u2014
p117
aV("What do I do about wild pigs  being a nuisance?") (Laughter) \u2014
p118
aVWild pigs are a huge problem  in Honolulu, apparently.
p119
aVIn one Saturday afternoon,
p120
aVthey were able to populate most of the content
p121
aVfor most of the frequently asked questions,
p122
aVbut more importantly than that,
p123
aVthey created a new way for citizens  to participate in their government.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,
p126
aVbut it gets more awesome.
p127
aVOn the National Day of Civic Hacking
p128
aVthis past June in Oakland, where I live,
p129
aVthe Code For America team in Oakland
p130
aVtook the open source code base of Honolulu Answers
p131
aVand turned it into Oakland Answers,
p132
aVand again we held a write-a-thon
p133
aVwhere we took the most frequently asked questions
p134
aVand had citizens write the answers to them,
p135
aVand I got into the act.
p136
aVI authored this answer, and a few others.
p137
aVAnd I'm trying to this day to articulate
p138
aVthe sense of empowerment and responsibility
p139
aVthat I feel for the place that I live
p140
aVbased simply on this small act of participation.
p141
aVAnd by stitching together my small act
p142
aVwith the thousands of other small acts of participation
p143
aVthat we're enabling through civic hacking,
p144
aVwe think we can reenergize citizenship
p145
aVand restore trust in government.
p146
aa(lp147
VAt this point, you may be wondering
p148
aVwhat city officials think of all this.
p149
aVThey actually love it.
p150
aVAs most of you guys know, cities are being asked
p151
aVevery day to do more with less,
p152
aVand they're always looking for innovative solutions
p153
aVto entrenched problems.
p154
aVSo when you give citizens a way to participate
p155
aVbeyond attending a town hall meeting,
p156
aVcities can actually capture
p157
aVthe capacity in their communities
p158
aVto do the business of government.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow I don't want to leave the impression
p161
aVthat civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.
p162
aVIt's happening across the globe,
p163
aVand one of my favorite examples
p164
aVis from Mexico City, where earlier this year,
p165
aVthe Mexico House of Representatives
p166
aVentered into a contract with a software development firm
p167
aVto build an app that legislators would use
p168
aVto track bills.
p169
aVSo this was just for the handful of legislators
p170
aVin the House.
p171
aVAnd the contract was a two-year contract
p172
aVfor 9.3 million dollars.
p173
aVNow a lot of people were really angry about this,
p174
aVespecially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars
p175
aVwas an absolutely outrageous amount of money
p176
aVfor what was a very simple app.
p177
aVBut instead of taking to the streets,
p178
aVthey issued a challenge.
p179
aVThey asked programmers in Mexico
p180
aVto build something better and cheaper,
p181
aVand they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars \u2014
p182
aV10,000 times cheaper
p183
aVthan the government contract,
p184
aVand they gave the entrants 10 days.
p185
aVAnd in those 10 days,
p186
aVthey submitted 173 apps,
p187
aVfive of which were presented to Congress
p188
aVand are still in the app store today.
p189
aVAnd because of this action,
p190
aVthat contract was vacated,
p191
aVand now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City
p192
aVwhich is home to one of our partners,
p193
aVCode for Mexico City.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd so what you see in all three of these places,
p196
aVin Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,
p197
aVare the elements that are at the core of civic hacking.
p198
aVIt's citizens who saw things that could be working better
p199
aVand they decided to fix them,
p200
aVand through that work, they're creating
p201
aVa 21st-century ecosystem of participation.
p202
aVThey're creating a whole new set of ways
p203
aVfor citizens to be involved,
p204
aVbesides voting or signing a petition or protesting.
p205
aVThey can actually build government.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo back to our friend Ben Franklin,
p208
aVwho, one of his lesser-known accomplishments
p209
aVwas that in 1736 he founded
p210
aVthe first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia,
p211
aVcalled a brigade.
p212
aVAnd it's because he and his friends noticed
p213
aVthat the city was having trouble keeping up
p214
aVwith all the fires that were happening in the city,
p215
aVso in true civic hacker fashion,
p216
aVthey built a solution.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd we have our own brigades at Code for America
p219
aVworking on the projects that I've just described,
p220
aVand we want to ask you
p221
aVto follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps
p222
aVand come join us.
p223
aVWe have 31 brigades in the U.S.
p224
aVWe are pleased to announce today
p225
aVthat we're opening up the  brigade to international cities
p226
aVfor the first time,
p227
aVstarting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.
p228
aVYou can find out if there's a brigade where you live
p229
aVat brigade.codeforamerica.org,
p230
aVand if there's not a brigade where you live, we will help you.
p231
aVWe've created a tool kit which also lives
p232
aVat brigade.codeforamerica.org,
p233
aVand we will support you along the way.
p234
aVOur goal is to create a global network of civic hackers
p235
aVwho are innovating on the existing system
p236
aVin order to build tools that will solve
p237
aVentrenched problems,
p238
aVthat will support local government,
p239
aVand that will empower citizens.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo please come hack with us.
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you.
