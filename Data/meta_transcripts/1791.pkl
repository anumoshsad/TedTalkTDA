VSo here's the most important economic fact of our time.
p4
aVWe are living in an age of surging income inequality,
p5
aVparticularly between those at the very top
p6
aVand everyone else.
p7
aVThis shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,
p8
aVbut it's a global phenomenon.
p9
aVIt's happening in communist China,
p10
aVin formerly communist Russia,
p11
aVit's happening in India, in my own native Canada.
p12
aVWe're even seeing it in cozy social democracies
p13
aVlike Sweden, Finland and Germany.
p14
aa(lp15
VLet me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.
p16
aVIn the 1970s, the One Percent
p17
aVaccounted for about 10 percent of the national income
p18
aVin the United States.
p19
aVToday, their share has more than doubled
p20
aVto above 20 percent.
p21
aVBut what's even more striking
p22
aVis what's happening at the very tippy top
p23
aVof the income distribution.
p24
aVThe 0.1 percent in the U.S.
p25
aVtoday account for more than eight percent
p26
aVof the national income.
p27
aVThey are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.
p28
aVLet me give you another number to put that in perspective,
p29
aVand this is a figure that was calculated in 2005
p30
aVby Robert Reich,
p31
aVthe Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.
p32
aVReich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,
p33
aVBill Gates and Warren Buffett,
p34
aVand he found that it was equivalent to the wealth
p35
aVof the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,
p36
aV120 million people.
p37
aVNow, as it happens,
p38
aVWarren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,
p39
aVhe is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,
p40
aVand he has his own favorite number.
p41
aVBuffett likes to point out that in 1992,
p42
aVthe combined wealth of the people
p43
aVon the Forbes 400 list \u2014
p44
aVand this is the list of the 400 richest Americans \u2014
p45
aVwas 300 billion dollars.
p46
aVJust think about it.
p47
aVYou didn't even need to be a billionaire
p48
aVto get on that list in 1992.
p49
aVWell, today, that figure has more than quintupled
p50
aVto 1.7 trillion,
p51
aVand I probably don't need to tell you
p52
aVthat we haven't seen anything similar happen
p53
aVto the middle class,
p54
aVwhose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,
p57
aVbut we've been slow to notice it.
p58
aVOne of the reasons, I think,
p59
aVis a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.
p60
aVChanges which are slow and gradual
p61
aVcan be hard to notice
p62
aVeven if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.
p63
aVThink about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.
p64
aVBut I think there's something else going on.
p65
aVTalking about income inequality,
p66
aVeven if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,
p67
aVcan make us feel uncomfortable.
p68
aVIt feels less positive, less optimistic,
p69
aVto talk about how the pie is sliced
p70
aVthan to think about how to make the pie bigger.
p71
aVAnd if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,
p72
aVtalking about income distribution,
p73
aVand inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,
p74
aVcan be downright threatening.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo we're living in the age of surging income inequality,
p77
aVespecially at the top.
p78
aVWhat's driving it, and what can we do about it?
p79
aa(lp80
VOne set of causes is political:
p81
aVlower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,
p82
aVprivatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,
p83
aVall of these have contributed
p84
aVto more and more income going to the very, very top.
p85
aa(lp86
VA lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped
p87
aVunder the category of "crony capitalism,"
p88
aVpolitical changes that benefit a group
p89
aVof well-connected insiders
p90
aVbut don't actually do much good for the rest of us.
p91
aVIn practice, getting rid of crony capitalism
p92
aVis incredibly difficult.
p93
aVThink of all the years reformers of various stripes
p94
aVhave tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,
p95
aVor how hard it is to re-regulate the banks
p96
aVeven after the most profound financial crisis
p97
aVsince the Great Depression,
p98
aVor even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,
p99
aVincluding those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"
p100
aVto pay taxes at a rate even approaching that
p101
aVpaid by the middle class.
p102
aVBut while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice
p103
aVis really, really hard,
p104
aVat least intellectually, it's an easy problem.
p105
aVAfter all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.
p106
aVIndeed, this is one of those rare issues
p107
aVthat unites the left and the right.
p108
aVA critique of crony capitalism is as central
p109
aVto the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,
p112
aVthe easy part of the problem,
p113
aVthings get trickier when you look at the economic drivers
p114
aVof surging income inequality.
p115
aVIn and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.
p116
aVGlobalization and the technology revolution,
p117
aVthe twin economic transformations
p118
aVwhich are changing our lives
p119
aVand transforming the global economy,
p120
aVare also powering the rise of the super-rich.
p121
aVJust think about it.
p122
aVFor the first time in history,
p123
aVif you are an energetic entrepreneur
p124
aVwith a brilliant new idea
p125
aVor a fantastic new product,
p126
aVyou have almost instant, almost frictionless access
p127
aVto a global market of more than a billion people.
p128
aVAs a result, if you are very, very smart
p129
aVand very, very lucky,
p130
aVyou can get very, very rich
p131
aVvery, very quickly.
p132
aVThe latest poster boy for this phenomenon
p133
aVis David Karp.
p134
aVThe 26-year-old founder of Tumblr
p135
aVrecently sold his company to Yahoo
p136
aVfor 1.1 billion dollars.
p137
aVThink about that for a minute:
p138
aV1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.
p139
aVIt's easiest to see how the technology revolution
p140
aVand globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect
p141
aVin highly visible fields,
p142
aVlike sports and entertainment.
p143
aVWe can all watch how a fantastic athlete
p144
aVor a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills
p145
aVacross the global economy as never before.
p146
aVBut today, that superstar effect
p147
aVis happening across the entire economy.
p148
aVWe have superstar technologists.
p149
aVWe have superstar bankers.
p150
aVWe have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.
p151
aVThere are superstar cooks
p152
aVand superstar farmers.
p153
aVThere are even, and this is my personal favorite example,
p154
aVsuperstar dentists,
p155
aVthe most dazzling exemplar of whom
p156
aVis Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers
p157
aVto the smiles of fellow superstars
p158
aVlike Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich
p159
aVor European-born American fashion designer
p160
aVDiane von Furstenberg.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut while it's pretty easy to see how globalization
p163
aVand the technology revolution
p164
aVare creating this global plutocracy,
p165
aVwhat's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.
p166
aVAnd that's because,
p167
aVin contrast with crony capitalism,
p168
aVso much of what globalization and the technology revolution
p169
aVhave done is highly positive.
p170
aVLet's start with technology.
p171
aVI love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.
p172
aVI love the fact that they mean that
p173
aVwhoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk
p174
aVfar beyond this auditorium.
p175
aVI'm even more of a fan of globalization.
p176
aVThis is the transformation
p177
aVwhich has lifted hundreds of millions
p178
aVof the world's poorest people out of poverty
p179
aVand into the middle class,
p180
aVand if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,
p181
aVit's made many new products affordable \u2014
p182
aVwho do you think built your iPhone? \u2014
p183
aVand things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.
p184
aVThink of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo what's not to like?
p187
aVWell, a few things.
p188
aVOne of the things that worries me
p189
aVis how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy
p190
aVcan become crony plutocracy.
p191
aVImagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur
p192
aVwho has successfully sold that idea or that product
p193
aVto the global billions
p194
aVand become a billionaire in the process.
p195
aVIt gets tempting at that point
p196
aVto use your economic nous
p197
aVto manipulate the rules of the global political economy
p198
aVin your own favor.
p199
aVAnd that's no mere hypothetical example.
p200
aVThink about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.
p201
aVThese are among the world's most admired,
p202
aVmost beloved, most innovative companies.
p203
aVThey also happen to be particularly adept
p204
aVat working the international tax system
p205
aVso as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
p206
aVAnd why stop at just playing the global political
p207
aVand economic system as it exists
p208
aVto your own maximum advantage?
p209
aVOnce you have the tremendous economic power
p210
aVthat we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution
p211
aVand the political power that inevitably entails,
p212
aVit becomes tempting as well
p213
aVto start trying to change the rules of the game
p214
aVin your own favor.
p215
aVAgain, this is no mere hypothetical.
p216
aVIt's what the Russian oligarchs did
p217
aVin creating the sale-of-the-century privatization
p218
aVof Russia's natural resources.
p219
aVIt's one way of describing what happened
p220
aVwith deregulation of the financial services
p221
aVin the U.S. and the U.K.
p222
aa(lp223
VA second thing that worries me
p224
aVis how easily meritocratic plutocracy
p225
aVcan become aristocracy.
p226
aVOne way of describing the plutocrats
p227
aVis as alpha geeks,
p228
aVand they are people who are acutely aware
p229
aVof how important highly sophisticated
p230
aVanalytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.
p231
aVThat's why they are spending
p232
aVunprecedented time and resources
p233
aVeducating their own children.
p234
aVThe middle class is spending more on schooling too,
p235
aVbut in the global educational arms race
p236
aVthat starts at nursery school
p237
aVand ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,
p238
aVthe 99 percent is increasingly outgunned
p239
aVby the One Percent.
p240
aVThe result is something that economists Alan Krueger
p241
aVand Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.
p242
aVAs income inequality increases,
p243
aVsocial mobility decreases.
p244
aVThe plutocracy may be a meritocracy,
p245
aVbut increasingly you have to be born
p246
aVon the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe third thing, and this is what worries me the most,
p249
aVis the extent to which those same largely positive forces
p250
aVwhich are driving the rise of the global plutocracy
p251
aValso happen to be hollowing out the middle class
p252
aVin Western industrialized economies.
p253
aVLet's start with technology.
p254
aVThose same forces that are creating billionaires
p255
aVare also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.
p256
aVWhen's the last time you used a travel agent?
p257
aVAnd in contrast with the industrial revolution,
p258
aVthe titans of our new economy
p259
aVaren't creating that many new jobs.
p260
aVAt its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,
p261
aVFacebook fewer than 10,000.
p262
aVThe same is true of globalization.
p263
aVFor all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people
p264
aVout of poverty in the emerging markets,
p265
aVit's also outsourcing a lot of jobs
p266
aVfrom the developed Western economies.
p267
aVThe terrifying reality is
p268
aVthat there is no economic rule
p269
aVwhich automatically translates
p270
aVincreased economic growth
p271
aVinto widely shared prosperity.
p272
aVThat's shown in what I consider to be
p273
aVthe most scary economic statistic of our time.
p274
aVSince the late 1990s, increases in productivity
p275
aVhave been decoupled from increases
p276
aVin wages and employment.
p277
aVThat means that our countries are getting richer,
p278
aVour companies are getting more efficient,
p279
aVbut we're not creating more jobs
p280
aVand we're not paying people, as a whole, more.
p281
aa(lp282
VOne scary conclusion you could draw from all of this
p283
aVis to worry about structural unemployment.
p284
aVWhat worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.
p285
aVAfter all, in a totally free labor market,
p286
aVwe could find jobs for pretty much everyone.
p287
aVThe dystopia that worries me
p288
aVis a universe in which a few geniuses
p289
aVinvent Google and its ilk
p290
aVand the rest of us are employed giving them massages.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo when I get really depressed about all of this,
p293
aVI comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.
p294
aVAfter all, for all its grim, satanic mills,
p295
aVit worked out pretty well, didn't it?
p296
aVAfter all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller \u2014
p297
aVwell, there are a few exceptions \u2014
p298
aVand live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.
p299
aVBut it's important to remember
p300
aVthat before we learned how to share the fruits
p301
aVof the Industrial Revolution
p302
aVwith the broad swathes of society,
p303
aVwe had to go through two depressions,
p304
aVthe Great Depression of the 1930s,
p305
aVthe Long Depression of the 1870s,
p306
aVtwo world wars, communist revolutions
p307
aVin Russia and in China,
p308
aVand an era of tremendous social
p309
aVand political upheaval in the West.
p310
aVWe also, not coincidentally,
p311
aVwent through an era of tremendous
p312
aVsocial and political inventions.
p313
aVWe created the modern welfare state.
p314
aVWe created public education.
p315
aVWe created public health care.
p316
aVWe created public pensions.
p317
aVWe created unions.
p318
aa(lp319
VToday, we are living through an era
p320
aVof economic transformation
p321
aVcomparable in its scale and its scope
p322
aVto the Industrial Revolution.
p323
aVTo be sure that this new economy benefits us all
p324
aVand not just the plutocrats,
p325
aVwe need to embark on an era
p326
aVof comparably ambitious social and political change.
p327
aVWe need a new New Deal.
