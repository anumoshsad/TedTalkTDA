VThis man is wearing what we call
p4
aVa bee beard. (Laughter)
p5
aVA beard full of bees.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, this is what many of you might picture
p8
aVwhen you think about honeybees, maybe insects,
p9
aVor maybe anything that has more legs than two.
p10
aVAnd let me start by telling you, I gotcha.
p11
aVI understand that. But, there are many things to know,
p12
aVand I want you to open your minds here,
p13
aVkeep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.
p14
aa(lp15
VNotice that this man is not getting stung.
p16
aVHe probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,
p17
aVand the other bees are attracted to it.
p18
aVSo this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,
p19
aVand that goes deep back for thousands of years.
p20
aVWe're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees
p21
aVfor pollination and, even more recently,
p22
aVas an economic commodity.
p23
aa(lp24
VMany of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing,
p25
aVnot just dying, but they're gone.
p26
aVWe don't even find dead bodies.
p27
aVThis is called colony collapse disorder,
p28
aVand it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe
p29
aVstill do not know what's causing it,
p30
aVbut what we do know is that, with the declining numbers
p31
aVof bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops
p32
aVthat we rely on for food is going up in price.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo honeybees are important for their role in the economy
p35
aVas well as in agriculture.
p36
aVHere you can see some pictures of what are called
p37
aVgreen roofs, or urban agriculture.
p38
aVWe're familiar with the image on the left that shows
p39
aVa local neighborhood garden in the South End.
p40
aVThat's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.
p41
aVAnd perhaps a green roof in the future,
p42
aVwhen we're further utilizing urban areas,
p43
aVwhere there are stacks of garden spaces.
p44
aa(lp45
VCheck out this image above the orange line in Boston.
p46
aVTry to spot the beehive. It's there.
p47
aVIt's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,
p48
aVand it's been there for a couple of years now.
p49
aVThe way that urban beekeeping currently operates
p50
aVis that the beehives are quite hidden,
p51
aVand it's not because they need to be.
p52
aVIt's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,
p53
aVand that's why I want you today to try to think about this,
p54
aVthink about the benefits of bees in cities
p55
aVand why they really are a terrific thing.
p56
aa(lp57
VLet me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.
p58
aVSo we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,
p59
aVeven some alfalfa in hay that the livestock
p60
aVfor the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,
p61
aVbut you've got male and female parts to a plant here,
p62
aVand basically pollinators are attracted to plants
p63
aVfor their nectar, and in the process,
p64
aVa bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,
p65
aVor that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,
p66
aVand then travel to different flowers, and eventually
p67
aVan apple, in this case, will be produced.
p68
aVYou can see the orientation. The stem is down.
p69
aVThe blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,
p70
aVbut that's a basic overview of how pollination works.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd let's think about urban living, not today,
p73
aVand not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?
p74
aVWhat's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges
p75
aVthese days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,
p76
aVbillions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,
p77
aVand how little space there will be to fit all of them,
p78
aVso we need to change the way that we see cities, and
p79
aVlooking at this picture on the left of New York City today,
p80
aVyou can see how gray and brown it is.
p81
aVWe have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back
p82
aVinto the atmosphere,
p83
aVcontributing to global climate change, no doubt.
p84
aVWhat about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops
p85
aVeverywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops
p86
aVright in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,
p87
aVwe save on a healthier diet, and we also educate
p88
aVand create new jobs locally.
p89
aVWe need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.
p90
aa(lp91
VHere's some data that we collected through our company
p92
aVwith Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage
p93
aVhoneybee hives for anybody who wants them,
p94
aVin the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,
p95
aVand the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop
p96
aVor fire escape, for even that matter,
p97
aVand seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.
p98
aa(lp99
VThere's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed
p100
aVin these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,
p101
aVoverwintering survival.
p102
aVNow this has been a huge problem for many years,
p103
aVbasically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came
p104
aVand brought many different viruses, bacteria
p105
aVand fungal diseases with it.
p106
aVOverwintering success is hard,
p107
aVand that's when most of the colonies are lost,
p108
aVand we found that in the cities, bees are surviving
p109
aVbetter than they are in the country.
p110
aVA bit counterintuitive, right?
p111
aVWe think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,
p112
aVbut that's not what the bees are showing.
p113
aVThe bees like it in the city. (Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VFurthermore, they also produce more honey.
p116
aVThe urban honey is delicious.
p117
aVThe bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,
p118
aVwhere we have hundreds of thousands of bees
p119
aVflying overheard right now
p120
aVthat I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,
p121
aVare going to all of the local community gardens
p122
aVand making delicious, healthy honey
p123
aVthat just tastes like the flowers in our city.
p124
aVSo the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,
p125
aVis higher as well as the overwintering survival,
p126
aVcompared to rural areas.
p127
aVAgain, a bit counterintuitive.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd looking back historically at the timeline
p130
aVof honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see
p131
aVthat there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.
p132
aVSo the problems of bees today isn't necessarily
p133
aVsomething new. It has been happening
p134
aVsince over a thousand years ago,
p135
aVbut what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo one thing I want to encourage you to think about
p138
aVis the idea of what an urban island is.
p139
aVYou think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.
p140
aVWhy are bees doing better in the city?
p141
aVThis is a big question now to help us understand
p142
aVwhy they should be in the city.
p143
aVPerhaps there's more pollen in the city.
p144
aVWith the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can
p145
aVcarry pollen with them, very light pollen,
p146
aVand it's just a big supermarket in the city.
p147
aVA lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks.
p148
aVPerhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities
p149
aVthan there are in [rural] areas.
p150
aVPerhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet,
p151
aVbut that's one idea to think about, urban islands.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd colony collapse disorder is not the only thing
p154
aVaffecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying,
p155
aVand it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time.
p156
aVWhat you can see up here is a map of the world,
p157
aVand we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, the varroa mite is what changed the game
p160
aVin beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right,
p161
aVthe years are changing, we're coming up to modern times,
p162
aVand you can see the spread of the varroa mite
p163
aVfrom the early 1900s through now.
p164
aVIt's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia.
p165
aV1971, we saw it spread to Europe and South America,
p166
aVand then, when we get to the 1980s,
p167
aVand specifically to 1987, the varroa mite finally came
p168
aVto North America and to the United States,
p169
aVand that is when the game changed
p170
aVfor honeybees in the United States.
p171
aa(lp172
VMany of us will remember our childhood growing up,
p173
aVmaybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.
p174
aVThink of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different.
p175
aVThey don't experience this.
p176
aVThe bees just aren't around anymore.
p177
aVSo we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhat can we do here?
p180
aVSo, what I do is honeybee research.
p181
aVI got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health.
p182
aVI started in 2005 studying honeybees.
p183
aVIn 2006, honeybees started disappearing,
p184
aVso suddenly, like, this little nerd kid
p185
aVgoing to school working with bugs \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p186
aVbecame very relevant in the world.
p187
aVAnd it worked out that way.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier.
p190
aVI don't research what's killing the bees, per se.
p191
aVI'm not one of the many researchers around the world
p192
aVwho's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases
p193
aVor habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees.
p194
aVWe're looking at ways to make bees healthier
p195
aVthrough vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics,
p196
aVand other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees,
p197
aVand this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it.
p198
aVYou just mix up some pollen, sugar and water,
p199
aVand whatever active ingredient you want to put in,
p200
aVand you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved,
p201
aVjust immune boosters.
p202
aa(lp203
VHumans think about our own health in a prospective way.
p204
aVWe exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins.
p205
aVWhy don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way?
p206
aVBring them to areas where they're thriving
p207
aVand try to make them healthier before they get sick.
p208
aa(lp209
VI spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines
p210
aVwith needles. (Laughter) Like, years,
p211
aVyears at the bench, "Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m.
p212
aVand I'm still pricking bees." (Laughter)
p213
aVAnd then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?"
p214
aVIt's like, "Ugh," so that's what we do. (Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VI'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives,
p217
aVbecause they can be anything.
p218
aVI mean, really open your mind with this.
p219
aVYou can paint a hive to match your home.
p220
aVYou can hide a hive inside your home.
p221
aVThese are three hives on the rooftop
p222
aVof the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,
p223
aVand they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched
p224
aVthe new color of the inside of their rooms to do
p225
aVsome type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets,
p226
aVand these bees are terrific, and they also will use
p227
aVherbs that are growing in the garden.
p228
aVThat's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking,
p229
aVand the honey \u2014 they do live events \u2014
p230
aVthey'll use that honey at their bars.
p231
aVHoney is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar
p232
aVbecause there are different types of sugars in there.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe also have a classroom hives project,
p235
aVwhere \u2014 this is a nonprofit venture \u2014
p236
aVwe're spreading the word around the world for how
p237
aVhoneybee hives can be taken into the classroom
p238
aVor into the museum setting, behind glass,
p239
aVand used as an educational tool.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis hive that you see here has been
p242
aVin Fenway High School for many years now.
p243
aVThe bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.
p244
aVNobody notices it. If you're not a flower,
p245
aVthese bees do not care about you. (Laughter)
p246
aVThey don't. They don't. They'll say,
p247
aV"S'cuse me, flying around." (Laughter)
p248
aVSome other images here in telling a part of the story
p249
aVthat really made urban beekeeping terrific is
p250
aVin New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010.
p251
aVThat's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate
p252
aVall of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands?
p253
aVI mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company
p254
aVcalled Green City Growers, and they are going
p255
aVand pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips,
p256
aVand if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit.
p257
aVTheir clients aren't happy, and people go hungry.
p258
aVSo this is important.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe have also some images of honey from Brooklyn.
p261
aVNow, this was a mystery in the New York Times
p262
aVwhere the honey was very red, and the
p263
aVNew York State forensics department came in
p264
aVand they actually did some science to match
p265
aVthe red dye with that found
p266
aVin a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter)
p267
aVSo you can tailor your honey to taste however you want
p268
aVby planting bee-friendly flowers.
p269
aa(lp270
VParis has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping.
p271
aVThey've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house
p272
aVfor many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking,
p273
aV"Wow, we can do this, and we should do this."
p274
aVAlso in London, and in Europe across the board,
p275
aVthey're very advanced in their use of green rooftops
p276
aVand integrating beehives,
p277
aVand I'll show you an ending note here.
p278
aa(lp279
VI would like to encourage you to open your mind.
p280
aVWhat can you do to save the bees or to help them
p281
aVor to think of sustainable cities in the future?
p282
aVWell, really, just change your perspective.
p283
aVTry to understand that bees are very important.
p284
aVA bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.
p285
aVThe bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting,
p286
aVso they don't want to do it either. (Laughter)
p287
aVIt's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city.
p288
aVYou could even get your own hive if you want.
p289
aVThere are great resources available,
p290
aVand there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you
p291
aVand it's important for our educational system in the world
p292
aVfor students to learn about agriculture worldwide
p293
aVsuch as this little girl, who, again, is not even getting stung.
p294
aVThank you. (Applause)
