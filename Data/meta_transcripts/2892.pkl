V"Robam kbach boran,"
p4
aVor the art of Khmer classical dance,
p5
aVis more than 1,000 years old.
p6
aVIt was developed as a prayer in movement
p7
aVfor rain and fertility,
p8
aVand a prosperity that this meant for an agricultural society.
p9
aVDancers who were both men and women
p10
aVwere offered to temples
p11
aVwhere they served as living bridges between heaven and earth.
p12
aVTheir dancing bodies carried the prayers of the people up to the gods,
p13
aVand the will of the deities was delivered back through them
p14
aVto the people and the land.
p15
aa(lp16
VThere are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.
p17
aVOur backs are arched,
p18
aVour knees are bent,
p19
aVour toes are curled,
p20
aVour elbows are hyperflexed
p21
aVand our fingers are curved backwards.
p22
aVAll of these curves create a serpentine impression,
p23
aVand this is important because before the introduction of major religions,
p24
aVKhmers, and people all over the world practiced animism.
p25
aVSerpents were especially important in this belief system
p26
aVbecause in their fluid, curvilinear movement,
p27
aVthey mimicked the flow of water.
p28
aVSo to invoke the serpent in your dancing body then
p29
aVwas to conjure the image of rivers cutting across the earth:
p30
aVinspire the flow of life-giving waters.
p31
aa(lp32
VAs you can see then,
p33
aVKhmer classical dance is a transformation of nature,
p34
aVof both the physical world around us and of our own internal universe.
p35
aVWe have four primary hand gestures that we use.
p36
aVCan we do them together?
p37
aVYeah? OK.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is a tree.
p40
aVThat tree will grow,
p41
aVand then it will have leaves.
p42
aVAfter it has leaves,
p43
aVit'll have flowers,
p44
aVand after it has flowers,
p45
aVit'll have fruit.
p46
aVThat fruit will drop
p47
aVand a new tree will grow.
p48
aVAnd in those four gestures
p49
aVis the cycle of life.
p50
aa(lp51
VThese four gestures are then used
p52
aVto create a whole entire language with which dancers express themselves.
p53
aVSo for example,
p54
aVI can say,
p55
aV"I."
p56
aV"I."
p57
aVIn dance that would be ...
p58
aV"I."
p59
aVOr I can say ...
p60
aV"Hey you, come here, come here."
p61
aVIn dance ...
p62
aV"Come here,"
p63
aVor, "Go, go."
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
V"Go."
p68
aVAnd everything from ...
p69
aVlove ...
p70
aVto sadness,
p71
aVto \u2014
p72
aa(lp73
V(Stomping)
p74
aa(lp75
Vanger
p76
aVcan be expressed through the dance as well.
p77
aa(lp78
VThere's a certain magic
p79
aVin the way that things are filtered, transformed and put together
p80
aVto create limitless possibilities in art.
p81
aVThe Khmer word for art,
p82
aVsilapak,
p83
aVin fact, at its root, means "magic."
p84
aVThe artist \u2014
p85
aVthe silapakar,
p86
aVor the silapakarani, then,
p87
aVis nothing short of a magician.
p88
aVI am very proud to say
p89
aVthat I belong to a long line of magicians,
p90
aVfrom my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,
p91
aVto her teachers who were stars in the royal palace,
p92
aVto the ancient dancers of Angkor
p93
aVand to the primal villagers
p94
aVfrom which the art form originally took life.
p95
aa(lp96
VThat said,
p97
aVour cherished heritage was once almost completely destroyed.
p98
aVIf you are wearing glasses,
p99
aVplease stand up.
p100
aVIf you speak more than one language,
p101
aVplease stand up.
p102
aVIf you have light skin,
p103
aVplease stand up.
p104
aVYour glasses meant that you could afford health care.
p105
aVThat second or third language you spoke indicated your elite education.
p106
aVYour light skin meant you didn't have to work beneath the sun.
p107
aVUnder the Khmer Rouge,
p108
aVwho took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,
p109
aVwe would all be dead now,
p110
aVtargeted because of our assumed privilege.
p111
aVYou see,
p112
aVthe Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,
p113
aVand they saw centuries of rigid inequality.
p114
aVThe king and the few elites around him
p115
aVhad all the pleasures and comforts of the world
p116
aVwhile the mass majority suffered from backbreaking labor
p117
aVand harsh poverty.
p118
aVYou don't need a history book to see that this is true.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe Khmer word for "I,"
p121
aVfor "me,"
p122
aVis khnhom.
p123
aVThis very same word can also mean "slave"
p124
aVand dancers were in fact known as knhom preah robam,
p125
aVor "slaves of the sacred dance."
p126
aVThe Khmer Rouge sought to end slavery in Cambodia,
p127
aVyet somehow they turned everyone into slaves to do it.
p128
aVThey became the oppression that they sought to end.
p129
aVThey evacuated the capital
p130
aVand forced people into labor camps.
p131
aVThey tore families apart
p132
aVand brainwashed children against their own parents.
p133
aVEverywhere, people were dying and being killed,
p134
aVlosing their lives from disease,
p135
aVoverwork,
p136
aVexecution and starvation.
p137
aVThe result of this is that an entire third of Cambodia's population was lost
p138
aVin less than four years,
p139
aVand in that number were 90 percent of Khmer dance artists.
p140
aVIn other words,
p141
aVnine out of 10 visions for the tradition and future were lost.
p142
aa(lp143
VThankfully, however,
p144
aVit was my teacher's teachers,
p145
aVChea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,
p146
aVwho would lead the revival of the art form
p147
aVfrom the ashes of war and genocide:
p148
aVone student,
p149
aVone gesture,
p150
aVone dance at a time.
p151
aVThey wrote the love,
p152
aVmagic,
p153
aVbeauty,
p154
aVhistory and philosophy of our lineage
p155
aVinto the bodies of the next generation.
p156
aa(lp157
VNearly 40 years later,
p158
aVKhmer classical dance has been revived to new heights.
p159
aVYet somehow it still exists in a vulnerable environment.
p160
aVThe disastrous effects of war still haunt Khmer people today.
p161
aVIt is written in our bodies,
p162
aVmanifested in a genetic passage of PTSD
p163
aVand in families facing cyclical poverty
p164
aVand immense cultural rifts and language barriers.
p165
aa(lp166
VYet beauty is a most resilient thing.
p167
aVBeauty has this ability to grow anywhere and everywhere
p168
aVat any time.
p169
aVBeauty is what connects people through time and place.
p170
aVBeauty is a liberation from suffering.
p171
aVAs Khmer artists work to revive our culture and country,
p172
aVwe find that there are many paths in which to move forward into the future.
p173
aVAnd in a tradition where we often don't know the dancer's names,
p174
aVwho they were,
p175
aVwhat their lives were like,
p176
aVwhat they felt,
p177
aVlet me propose that we move forward honestly and openly from "khnhom."
p178
aVKhnhom not as in slave,
p179
aVbut as in conscious service.
p180
aVKhnhom:
p181
aV"I,"
p182
aV"me,"
p183
aV"flowering."
p184
aa(lp185
VMy name is Prumsodun Ok.
p186
aVI am Khmer,
p187
aVand I am American.
p188
aVI am the child of refugees,
p189
aVa creator, a healer,
p190
aVand a builder of bridges.
p191
aVI am my teacher's first male student
p192
aVin a tradition understood by many as female,
p193
aVand I founded Cambodia's first gay dance company.
p194
aVI am the incarnation of the beauty, dreams and power
p195
aVof those who came before me.
p196
aVThe convergence of past, present and future,
p197
aVand of individual and collective.
p198
aa(lp199
VLet me then play that ancient and ageless role
p200
aVof the artist as messenger,
p201
aVby sharing the words of Chheng Phon
p202
aV"A garden with only one type of flower,
p203
aVor flowers of only one color,
p204
aVis no good."
p205
aVThis is a reminder that our strength,
p206
aVgrowth,
p207
aVsurvival
p208
aVand very existence,
p209
aVlies in diversity.
p210
aVIt is, however,
p211
aVa message of courage as well.
p212
aVFor a flower does not ask for anyone's permission to bloom.
p213
aVIt was born to offer itself to the world.
p214
aVFearless love is its nature.
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.
