VRight now
p4
aVthere is an aspiring teacher
p5
aVwho is working on a 60-page paper
p6
aVbased on some age-old education theory
p7
aVdeveloped by some dead education professor
p8
aVwondering to herself what this task
p9
aVthat she's engaging in
p10
aVhas to do with what she wants to do with her life,
p11
aVwhich is be an educator,
p12
aVchange lives, and spark magic.
p13
aVRight now there is an aspiring teacher
p14
aVin a graduate school of education
p15
aVwho is watching a professor babble on and on
p16
aVabout engagement
p17
aVin the most disengaging way possible.
p18
aVRight now
p19
aVthere's a first-year teacher at home
p20
aVwho is pouring through lesson plans
p21
aVtrying to make sense of standards,
p22
aVwho is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately,
p23
aVwhile at the same time saying to herself
p24
aVover and over again,
p25
aV"Don't smile till November,"
p26
aVbecause that's what she was taught
p27
aVin her teacher education program.
p28
aVRight now there's a student
p29
aVwho is coming up with a way
p30
aVto convince his mom or dad
p31
aVthat he's very, very sick
p32
aVand can't make it to school tomorrow.
p33
aVOn the other hand, right now
p34
aVthere are amazing educators
p35
aVthat are sharing information,
p36
aVinformation that is shared in such a beautiful way
p37
aVthat the students are sitting at the edge of their seats
p38
aVjust waiting for a bead of sweat
p39
aVto drop off the face of this person
p40
aVso they can soak up all that knowledge.
p41
aVRight now there is also a person
p42
aVwho has an entire audience rapt with attention,
p43
aVa person that is weaving a powerful narrative
p44
aVabout a world
p45
aVthat the people who are listening
p46
aVhave never imagined or seen before,
p47
aVbut if they close their eyes tightly enough,
p48
aVthey can envision that world
p49
aVbecause the storytelling is so compelling.
p50
aVRight now there's a person who can tell an audience
p51
aVto put their hands up in the air
p52
aVand they will stay there till he says,
p53
aV"Put them down."
p54
aVRight now.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo people will then say,
p57
aV"Well, Chris, you describe the guy
p58
aVwho is going through some awful training
p59
aVbut you're also describing these powerful educators.
p60
aVIf you're thinking about the world of education
p61
aVor urban education in particular,
p62
aVthese guys will probably cancel each other out,
p63
aVand then we'll be okay."
p64
aa(lp65
VThe reality is, the folks I described
p66
aVas the master teachers,
p67
aVthe master narrative builders,
p68
aVthe master storytellers
p69
aVare far removed from classrooms.
p70
aVThe folks who know the skills about how to teach
p71
aVand engage an audience
p72
aVdon't even know what teacher certification means.
p73
aVThey may not even have the degrees
p74
aVto be able to have anything
p75
aVto call an education.
p76
aVAnd that to me is sad.
p77
aVIt's sad because the people who I described,
p78
aVthey were very disinterested in the learning process,
p79
aVwant to be effective teachers,
p80
aVbut they have no models.
p81
aVI'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.
p82
aVMark Twain says that proper preparation,
p83
aVor teaching,
p84
aVis so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,
p85
aVit can turn awful practices into powerful ones,
p86
aVit can change men and transform them
p87
aVinto angels.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe folks who I described earlier
p90
aVgot proper preparation in teaching,
p91
aVnot in any college or university,
p92
aVbut by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage.
p93
aVGuess where those places are?
p94
aVBarber shops,
p95
aVrap concerts, and most importantly,
p96
aVin the black church.
p97
aVAnd I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy.
p98
aVWho here has been to a black church?
p99
aVWe got a couple of hands.
p100
aVYou go to a black church,
p101
aVtheir preacher starts off
p102
aVand he realizes that he has to engage the audience,
p103
aVso he starts off with this sort of wordplay
p104
aVin the beginning oftentimes,
p105
aVand then he takes a pause,
p106
aVand he says, "Oh my gosh, they're not quite paying attention."
p107
aVSo he says, "Can I get an amen?"
p108
aa(lp109
VAudience: Amen.
p110
aa(lp111
VChris Emdin: So I can I get an amen? Audience: Amen.
p112
aa(lp113
VCE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.
p114
aVThat preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.
p115
aVHe drops his voice at a very, very low volume
p116
aVwhen he wants people to key into him,
p117
aVand those things are the skills that we need
p118
aVfor the most engaging teachers.
p119
aVSo why does teacher education
p120
aVonly give you theory and theory
p121
aVand tell you about standards and tell you about
p122
aVall of these things that have nothing to do
p123
aVwith the basic skills, that magic that you need
p124
aVto engage an audience, to engage a student?
p125
aVSo I make the argument that we reframe teacher education,
p126
aVthat we could focus on content, and that's fine,
p127
aVand we could focus on theories, and that's fine,
p128
aVbut content and theories
p129
aVwith the absence of the magic
p130
aVof teaching and learning means nothing.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow people oftentimes say, "Well, magic is just magic."
p133
aVThere are teachers who,
p134
aVdespite all their challenges, who have those skills,
p135
aVget into those schools and are  able to engage an audience,
p136
aVand the administrator walks by and says,
p137
aV"Wow, he's so good, I wish all my teachers could be that good."
p138
aVAnd when they try to describe what that is,
p139
aVthey just say, "He has that magic."
p140
aa(lp141
VBut I'm here to tell you
p142
aVthat magic can be taught.
p143
aVMagic can be taught.
p144
aVMagic can be taught.
p145
aVNow, how do you teach it?
p146
aVYou teach it by allowing people
p147
aVto go into those spaces
p148
aVwhere the magic is happening.
p149
aVIf you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education,
p150
aVyou've got to leave the confines of that university
p151
aVand go into the hood.
p152
aVYou've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop,
p153
aVyou've got to attend that black church,
p154
aVand you've got to view those folks
p155
aVthat have the power to engage
p156
aVand just take notes on what they do.
p157
aVAt our teacher education classes at my university,
p158
aVI've started a project where every single student
p159
aVthat comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.
p160
aVThey watch the way that the rappers move
p161
aVand talk with their hands.
p162
aVThey study the way that he walks proudly across that stage.
p163
aVThey listen to his metaphors and analogies,
p164
aVand they start learning these little things
p165
aVthat if they practice enough
p166
aVbecomes the key to magic.
p167
aVThey learn that if you just stare at a student
p168
aVand raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,
p169
aVyou don't have to say a word
p170
aVbecause they know that that means that you want more.
p171
aVAnd if we could transform teacher education
p172
aVto focus on teaching teachers
p173
aVhow to create that magic
p174
aVthen poof! we could make dead classes come alive,
p175
aVwe could reignite imaginations,
p176
aVand we can change education.
