VI'm really glad to be here.
p4
aVI'm glad you're here,
p5
aVbecause that would be a little weird.
p6
aVI'm glad we're all here.
p7
aVAnd by "here," I don't mean here.
p8
aVOr here.
p9
aVBut here.
p10
aVI mean Earth.
p11
aVAnd by "we," I don't mean those of us in this auditorium,
p12
aVbut life,
p13
aVall life on Earth \u2014
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
Vfrom complex to single-celled,
p18
aVfrom mold to mushrooms
p19
aVto flying bears.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VThe interesting thing is,
p24
aVEarth is the only place we know of that has life \u2014
p25
aV8.7 million species.
p26
aVWe've looked other places,
p27
aVmaybe not as hard as we should or we could,
p28
aVbut we've looked and haven't found any;
p29
aVEarth is the only place we know of with life.
p30
aVIs Earth special?
p31
aVThis is a question I've wanted to know the answer to
p32
aVsince I was a small child,
p33
aVand I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium
p34
aVhas thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer.
p35
aVTo understand whether there are any planets \u2014
p36
aVout there in our solar system or beyond \u2014
p37
aVthat can support life,
p38
aVthe first step is to understand what life here requires.
p39
aa(lp40
VIt turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species,
p41
aVlife only needs three things.
p42
aVOn one side, all life on Earth needs energy.
p43
aVComplex life like us derives our energy from the sun,
p44
aVbut life deep underground can get its energy
p45
aVfrom things like chemical reactions.
p46
aVThere are a number of different energy sources
p47
aVavailable on all planets.
p48
aVOn the other side,
p49
aVall life needs food or nourishment.
p50
aVAnd this seems like a tall order, especially if you want a succulent tomato.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VHowever, all life on Earth derives its nourishment
p55
aVfrom only six chemical elements,
p56
aVand these elements can be found on any planetary body
p57
aVin our solar system.
p58
aVSo that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole,
p59
aVthe thing that's hardest to achieve.
p60
aVNot moose, but water.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAlthough moose would be pretty cool.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd not frozen water, and not water in a gaseous state, but liquid water.
p69
aVThis is what life needs to survive, all life.
p70
aVAnd many solar system bodies don't have liquid water,
p71
aVand so we don't look there.
p72
aVOther solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water,
p73
aVeven more than Earth,
p74
aVbut it's trapped beneath an icy shell,
p75
aVand so it's hard to access, it's hard to get to,
p76
aVit's hard to even find out if there's any life there.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo that leaves a few bodies that we should think about.
p79
aVSo let's make the problem simpler for ourselves.
p80
aVLet's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet.
p81
aVThere are only three bodies to think about in our solar system,
p82
aVwith regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet,
p83
aVand in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.
p84
aVYou want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid.
p85
aVYou have to be very careful with that atmosphere.
p86
aVYou can't have too much atmosphere, too thick or too warm an atmosphere,
p87
aVbecause then you end up too hot like Venus,
p88
aVand you can't have liquid water.
p89
aVBut if you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold,
p90
aVyou end up like Mars, too cold.
p91
aVSo Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,
p92
aVand Earth is just right.
p93
aVYou can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically
p94
aVwhere life can survive in our solar system.
p95
aVIt's a Goldilocks-type problem,
p96
aVand it's so simple that a child could understand it.
p97
aa(lp98
VHowever,
p99
aVI'd like to remind you of two things
p100
aVfrom the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often
p101
aVbut that I think are really relevant here.
p102
aVNumber one:
p103
aVif Mama Bear's bowl is too cold
p104
aVwhen Goldilocks walks into the room,
p105
aVdoes that mean it's always been too cold?
p106
aVOr could it have been just right at some other time?
p107
aVWhen Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer
p108
aVthat we get in the story.
p109
aVAnd the same is true with planets.
p110
aVThey're not static things. They change.
p111
aVThey vary. They evolve.
p112
aVAnd atmospheres do the same.
p113
aVSo let me give you an example.
p114
aa(lp115
VHere's one of my favorite pictures of Mars.
p116
aVIt's not the highest resolution image, it's not the sexiest image,
p117
aVit's not the most recent image,
p118
aVbut it's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet;
p119
aVriverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;
p120
aVriverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form.
p121
aVThis can't happen on Mars today.
p122
aVThe atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold
p123
aVfor water to be stable as a liquid.
p124
aVThis one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed,
p125
aVand it changed in big ways.
p126
aVAnd it changed from a state that we would define as habitable,
p127
aVbecause the three requirements for life were present long ago.
p128
aVWhere did that atmosphere go
p129
aVthat allowed water to be liquid at the surface?
p130
aa(lp131
VWell, one idea is it escaped away to space.
p132
aVAtmospheric particles got enough energy to break free
p133
aVfrom the gravity of the planet,
p134
aVescaping away to space, never to return.
p135
aVAnd this happens with all bodies with atmospheres.
p136
aVComets have tails
p137
aVthat are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape.
p138
aVBut Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time,
p139
aVand Mars and Earth as well.
p140
aVIt's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale.
p141
aVSo we'd like to figure out how much escaped over time
p142
aVso we can explain this transition.
p143
aa(lp144
VHow do atmospheres get their energy for escape?
p145
aVHow do particles get enough energy to escape?
p146
aVThere are two ways, if we're going to reduce things a little bit.
p147
aVNumber one, sunlight.
p148
aVLight emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles
p149
aVand warm the particles.
p150
aVYes, I'm dancing, but they \u2014
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VOh my God, not even at my wedding.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VThey get enough energy to escape and break free
p159
aVfrom the gravity of the planet just by warming.
p160
aVA second way they can get energy is from the solar wind.
p161
aVThese are particles, mass, material, spit out from the surface of the sun,
p162
aVand they go screaming through the solar system
p163
aVat 400 kilometers per second,
p164
aVsometimes faster during solar storms,
p165
aVand they go hurtling through interplanetary space
p166
aVtowards planets and their atmospheres,
p167
aVand they may provide energy
p168
aVfor atmospheric particles to escape as well.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is something that I'm interested in,
p171
aVbecause it relates to habitability.
p172
aVI mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story
p173
aVthat I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about,
p174
aVand the second one is a little bit more subtle.
p175
aVIf Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,
p176
aVand Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,
p177
aVshouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder
p178
aVif we're following the trend?
p179
aVThis thing that you've accepted your entire life,
p180
aVwhen you think about it a little bit more, may not be so simple.
p181
aVAnd of course, distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature.
p182
aVThis has to play into habitability.
p183
aVBut maybe there are other things we should be thinking about.
p184
aVMaybe it's the bowls themselves
p185
aVthat are also helping to determine the outcome in the story,
p186
aVwhat is just right.
p187
aa(lp188
VI could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics
p189
aVof these three planets
p190
aVthat may influence habitability,
p191
aVbut for selfish reasons related to my own research
p192
aVand the fact that I'm standing up here holding the clicker and you're not \u2014
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VI would like to talk for just a minute or two
p197
aVabout magnetic fields.
p198
aVEarth has one; Venus and Mars do not.
p199
aVMagnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet
p200
aVby electrically conducting churning fluid material
p201
aVthat creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
p202
aVIf you have a compass, you know which way north is.
p203
aVVenus and Mars don't have that.
p204
aVIf you have a compass on Venus and Mars,
p205
aVcongratulations, you're lost.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VDoes this influence habitability?
p210
aVWell, how might it?
p211
aVMany scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet
p212
aVserves as a shield for the atmosphere,
p213
aVdeflecting solar wind particles around the planet
p214
aVin a bit of a force field-type effect
p215
aVhaving to do with electric charge of those particles.
p216
aVI like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd yes, my colleagues who watch this later will realize
p221
aVthis is the first time in the history of our community
p222
aVthat the solar wind has been equated with mucus.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VOK, so the effect, then, is that Earth may have been protected
p227
aVfor billions of years,
p228
aVbecause we've had a magnetic field.
p229
aVAtmosphere hasn't been able to escape.
p230
aVMars, on the other hand, has been unprotected
p231
aVbecause of its lack of magnetic field,
p232
aVand over billions of years,
p233
aVmaybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away
p234
aVto account for a transition from a habitable planet
p235
aVto the planet that we see today.
p236
aa(lp237
VOther scientists think that magnetic fields
p238
aVmay act more like the sails on a ship,
p239
aVenabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind
p240
aVthan the planet would have been able to interact with by itself.
p241
aVThe sails may gather energy from the solar wind.
p242
aVThe magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind
p243
aVthat allows even more atmospheric escape to happen.
p244
aVIt's an idea that has to be tested,
p245
aVbut the effect and how it works
p246
aVseems apparent.
p247
aVThat's because we know
p248
aVenergy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere
p249
aVhere on Earth.
p250
aVThat energy is conducted along magnetic field lines
p251
aVdown into the polar regions,
p252
aVresulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.
p253
aVIf you've ever experienced them, it's magnificent.
p254
aVWe know the energy is getting in.
p255
aVWe're trying to measure how many particles are getting out
p256
aVand if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo I've posed a problem for you here,
p259
aVbut I don't have a solution yet.
p260
aVWe don't have a solution.
p261
aVBut we're working on it. How are we working on it?
p262
aVWell, we've sent spacecraft to all three planets.
p263
aVSome of them are orbiting now,
p264
aVincluding the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars,
p265
aVwhich I'm involved with and which is led here,
p266
aVout of the University of Colorado.
p267
aVIt's designed to measure atmospheric escape.
p268
aVWe have similar measurements from Venus and Earth.
p269
aVOnce we have all our measurements,
p270
aVwe can combine all these together, and we can understand
p271
aVhow all three planets interact with their space environment,
p272
aVwith the surroundings.
p273
aVAnd we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability
p274
aVor not.
p275
aa(lp276
VOnce we have that answer, why should you care?
p277
aVI mean, I care deeply ...
p278
aVAnd financially as well, but deeply.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VFirst of all, an answer to this question
p283
aVwill teach us more about these three planets,
p284
aVVenus, Earth and Mars,
p285
aVnot only about how they interact with their environment today,
p286
aVbut how they were billions of years ago,
p287
aVwhether they were habitable long ago or not.
p288
aVIt will teach us about atmospheres
p289
aVthat surround us and that are close.
p290
aVBut moreover, what we learn from these planets
p291
aVcan be applied to atmospheres everywhere,
p292
aVincluding planets that we're now observing around other stars.
p293
aVFor example, the Kepler spacecraft,
p294
aVwhich is built and controlled here in Boulder,
p295
aVhas been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky
p296
aVfor a couple years now,
p297
aVand it's found thousands of planets \u2014
p298
aVin one postage stamp-sized region of the sky
p299
aVthat we don't think is any different from any other part of the sky.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe've gone, in 20 years,
p302
aVfrom knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system,
p303
aVto now having so many,
p304
aVthat we don't know which ones to investigate first.
p305
aVAny lever will help.
p306
aVIn fact, based on observations that Kepler's taken
p307
aVand other similar observations,
p308
aVwe now believe that,
p309
aVof the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone,
p310
aVon average, every star has at least one planet.
p311
aVIn addition to that,
p312
aVestimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion
p313
aVof those planets that we would define as habitable
p314
aVin just our galaxy.
p315
aa(lp316
VWe have the observations of those planets,
p317
aVbut we just don't know which ones are habitable yet.
p318
aVIt's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot \u2014
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
Von a stage
p323
aVand knowing that there are other worlds out there
p324
aVand desperately wanting to know more about them,
p325
aVwanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them
p326
aVare a little bit like you.
p327
aVYou can't do that. You can't go there, not yet.
p328
aVAnd so you have to use the tools that you've developed around you
p329
aVfor Venus, Earth and Mars,
p330
aVand you have to apply them to these other situations,
p331
aVand hope that you're making reasonable inferences from the data,
p332
aVand that you're going to be able to determine the best candidates
p333
aVfor habitable planets, and those that are not.
p334
aa(lp335
VIn the end, and for now, at least,
p336
aVthis is our red spot, right here.
p337
aVThis is the only planet that we know of that's habitable,
p338
aValthough very soon we may come to know of more.
p339
aVBut for now, this is the only habitable planet,
p340
aVand this is our red spot.
p341
aVI'm really glad we're here.
p342
aa(lp343
VThanks.
