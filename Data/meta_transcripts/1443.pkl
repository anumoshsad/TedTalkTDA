VI'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
p4
aa(lp5
VImagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
p6
aVI'd like you to notice the color of the door,
p7
aVthe material that it's made out of.
p8
aVNow visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VThey are competing in a naked bicycle race,
p13
aVand they are headed straight for your front door.
p14
aVI need you to actually see this.
p15
aVThey are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,
p16
aVthey're bouncing around a lot.
p17
aVAnd they crash straight into the front door of your home.
p18
aVBicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,
p19
aVspokes end up in awkward places.
p20
aVStep over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,
p21
aVwhatever's on the other side,
p22
aVand appreciate the quality of the light.
p23
aVThe light is shining down on Cookie Monster.
p24
aVCookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.
p25
aVIt's a talking horse.
p26
aVYou can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
p27
aVYou can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
p28
aVWalk past him.
p29
aVWalk past him into your living room.
p30
aVIn your living room, in full imaginative broadband,
p31
aVpicture Britney Spears.
p32
aVShe is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,
p33
aVand she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."
p34
aVAnd then, follow me into your kitchen.
p35
aVIn your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,
p36
aVand out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,
p37
aVthe Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"
p38
aVhand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.
p39
aa(lp40
VOkay. Open your eyes.
p41
aa(lp42
VI want to tell you about a very bizarre contest
p43
aVthat is held every spring in New York City.
p44
aVIt's called the United States Memory Championship.
p45
aVAnd I had gone to cover this contest a few years back
p46
aVas a science journalist,
p47
aVexpecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.
p48
aVThis was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,
p49
aVwidely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VThey were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,
p54
aVlooking at them just once.
p55
aVThey were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.
p56
aVThey were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.
p57
aVThey were competing to see who could memorize
p58
aVthe order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.
p59
aVI was like, this is unbelievable.
p60
aVThese people must be freaks of nature.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd I started talking to a few of the competitors.
p63
aVThis is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,
p64
aVwhere he had one of the best-trained memories.
p65
aVAnd I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize
p66
aVthat you were a savant?"
p67
aVAnd Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.
p68
aVIn fact, I have just an average memory.
p69
aVEverybody who competes in this contest will tell you
p70
aVthat they have just an average memory.
p71
aVWe've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory
p72
aVusing a set of ancient techniques,
p73
aVtechniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,
p74
aVthe same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,
p75
aVthat medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."
p76
aVAnd I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd we were standing outside the competition hall,
p79
aVand Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,
p80
aVsays to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
p81
aVDo you know Britney Spears?"
p82
aVI'm like, "What? No. Why?"
p83
aV"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears
p84
aVhow to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards
p85
aVon U.S. national television.
p86
aVIt will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VI was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,
p91
aVbut maybe you could teach me.
p92
aVI mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
p93
aVAnd that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
p94
aa(lp95
VI ended up spending the better part of the next year
p96
aVnot only training my memory,
p97
aVbut also investigating it,
p98
aVtrying to understand how it works,
p99
aVwhy it sometimes doesn't work,
p100
aVand what its potential might be.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I met a host of really interesting people.
p103
aVThis is a guy called E.P.
p104
aVHe's an amnesic who had, very possibly,
p105
aVthe worst memory in the world.
p106
aVHis memory was so bad,
p107
aVthat he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,
p108
aVwhich is amazing.
p109
aVAnd he was this incredibly tragic figure,
p110
aVbut he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
p111
aa(lp112
VAt the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
p113
aVThis is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character
p114
aVin the movie "Rain Man."
p115
aVWe spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library
p116
aVmemorizing phone books,
p117
aVwhich was scintillating.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,
p122
aVtreatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,
p123
aVin antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.
p124
aVAnd I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
p125
aVOne of the really interesting things that I learned
p126
aVis that once upon a time,
p127
aVthis idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory
p128
aVwas not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
p129
aVOnce upon a time, people invested in their memories,
p130
aVin laboriously furnishing their minds.
p131
aa(lp132
VOver the last few millenia,
p133
aVwe've invented a series of technologies \u2014
p134
aVfrom the alphabet, to the scroll,
p135
aVto the codex, the printing press, photography,
p136
aVthe computer, the smartphone \u2014
p137
aVthat have made it progressively easier and easier
p138
aVfor us to externalize our memories,
p139
aVfor us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.
p140
aVThese technologies have made our modern world possible,
p141
aVbut they've also changed us.
p142
aVThey've changed us culturally,
p143
aVand I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.
p144
aVHaving little need to remember anymore,
p145
aVit sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
p146
aa(lp147
VOne of the last places on Earth where you still find
p148
aVpeople passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,
p149
aVis at this totally singular memory contest.
p150
aVIt's actually not that singular,
p151
aVthere are contests held all over the world.
p152
aVAnd I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
p153
aa(lp154
VA few years back a group of researchers at University College London
p155
aVbrought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.
p156
aVThey wanted to know:
p157
aVDo these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,
p158
aVanatomically different from the rest of ours?
p159
aVThe answer was no.
p160
aVAre they smarter than the rest of us?
p161
aVThey gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.
p162
aa(lp163
VThere was, however, one really interesting and telling difference
p164
aVbetween the brains of the memory champions
p165
aVand the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
p166
aVWhen they put these guys in an fMRI machine,
p167
aVscanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers
p168
aVand people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,
p169
aVthey found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain
p170
aVthan everyone else.
p171
aVOf note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,
p172
aVa part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.
p173
aVWhy?
p174
aVAnd is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?
p175
aa(lp176
VThe sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,
p177
aVevery year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,
p178
aVand then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis is my friend Ben Pridmore,
p181
aVthree-time world memory champion.
p182
aVOn his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards
p183
aVthat he is about to try to memorize in one hour,
p184
aVusing a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.
p185
aVHe used a similar technique
p186
aVto memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits
p187
aVin half an hour.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VYeah.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd while there are a whole host of ways
p194
aVof remembering stuff in these competitions,
p195
aVeverything, all of the techniques that are being used,
p196
aVultimately come down to a concept
p197
aVthat psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox
p200
aVknown as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:
p201
aVIf I tell two people to remember the same word,
p202
aVif I say to you,
p203
aV"Remember that there is a guy named Baker."
p204
aVThat's his name.
p205
aVAnd I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."
p206
aVOkay?
p207
aVAnd I come back to you at some point later on,
p208
aVand I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?
p209
aVDo you remember what it was?"
p210
aVThe person who was told his name is Baker
p211
aVis less likely to remember the same word
p212
aVthan the person was told his job is a baker.
p213
aVSame word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
p214
aVWhat's going on here?
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
p217
aVIt is entirely untethered from all of the other memories
p218
aVfloating around in your skull.
p219
aVBut the common noun "baker" \u2014 we know bakers.
p220
aVBakers wear funny white hats.
p221
aVBakers have flour on their hands.
p222
aVBakers smell good when they come home from work.
p223
aVMaybe we even know a baker.
p224
aVAnd when we first hear that word,
p225
aVwe start putting these associational hooks into it,
p226
aVthat make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
p227
aVThe entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,
p228
aVand the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,
p229
aVis figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers
p230
aVinto lower-case B bakers \u2014
p231
aVto take information that is lacking in context,
p232
aVin significance, in meaning,
p233
aVand transform it in some way,
p234
aVso that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things
p235
aVthat you have in your mind.
p236
aa(lp237
VOne of the more elaborate techniques for doing this
p238
aVdates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
p239
aVIt came to be known as the memory palace.
p240
aVThe story behind its creation goes like this:
p241
aa(lp242
VThere was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.
p243
aVHe was actually the hired entertainment,
p244
aVbecause back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,
p245
aVyou didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
p246
aVAnd he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,
p247
aVand at the moment he does,
p248
aVthe banquet hall collapses.
p249
aVKills everybody inside.
p250
aVIt doesn't just kill everybody,
p251
aVit mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.
p252
aVNobody can say who was inside,
p253
aVnobody can say where they were sitting.
p254
aVThe bodies can't be properly buried.
p255
aVIt's one tragedy compounding another.
p256
aVSimonides, standing outside,
p257
aVthe sole survivor amid the wreckage,
p258
aVcloses his eyes and has this realization,
p259
aVwhich is that in his mind's eye,
p260
aVhe can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.
p261
aVAnd he takes the relatives by the hand,
p262
aVand guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat Simonides figured out at that moment,
p265
aVis something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,
p266
aVwhich is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,
p267
aVand word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,
p268
aVwe have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
p269
aVIf I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story
p270
aVthat I just told you about Simonides,
p271
aVchances are you would have a tough time with it.
p272
aVBut, I would wager that if I asked you to recall
p273
aVwho is sitting on top of a talking tan horse
p274
aVin your foyer right now,
p275
aVyou would be able to see that.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe idea behind the memory palace
p278
aVis to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,
p279
aVand populate it with images of the things that you want to remember \u2014
p280
aVthe crazier, weirder, more bizarre,
p281
aVfunnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,
p282
aVthe more unforgettable it's likely to be.
p283
aVThis is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years
p284
aVto the earliest Latin memory treatises.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo how does this work?
p287
aVLet's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,
p288
aVand you want to do it from memory,
p289
aVand you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,
p290
aVif he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VWhat you might do
p295
aVis picture yourself at the front door of your house.
p296
aVAnd you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,
p297
aVto remind you that the first thing you want to talk about
p298
aVis this totally bizarre contest.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd then you'd go inside your house,
p303
aVand you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
p304
aVAnd that would remind you
p305
aVthat you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.
p306
aVAnd then you'd see an image of Britney Spears
p307
aVto remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.
p308
aVAnd you'd go into your kitchen,
p309
aVand the fourth topic you were going to talk about
p310
aVwas this strange journey that you went on for a year,
p311
aVand you'd have some friends to help you remember that.
p312
aa(lp313
VThis is how Roman orators memorized their speeches \u2014
p314
aVnot word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,
p315
aVbut topic-for-topic.
p316
aVIn fact, the phrase "topic sentence" \u2014
p317
aVthat comes from the Greek word "topos,"
p318
aVwhich means "place."
p319
aVThat's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric
p320
aVin these sorts of spatial terms.
p321
aVThe phrase "in the first place,"
p322
aVthat's like "in the first place of your memory palace."
p323
aa(lp324
VI thought this was just fascinating,
p325
aVand I got really into it.
p326
aVAnd I went to a few more of these memory contests,
p327
aVand I had this notion that I might write something longer
p328
aVabout this subculture of competitive memorizers.
p329
aVBut there was a problem.
p330
aVThe problem was that a memory contest
p331
aVis a pathologically boring event.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VTruly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs \u2014
p336
aVI mean, the most dramatic it gets
p337
aVis when somebody starts massaging their temples.
p338
aVAnd I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
p339
aVI know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,
p340
aVbut I don't have access to it.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd I realized, if I was going to tell this story,
p343
aVI needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
p344
aVAnd so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes
p345
aVevery morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,
p346
aVjust trying to remember something.
p347
aVMaybe it was a poem,
p348
aVmaybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
p349
aVAnd I found that this was shockingly fun.
p350
aVI never would have expected that.
p351
aVIt was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
p352
aVWhat you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better
p353
aVat creating, at dreaming up,
p354
aVthese utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,
p355
aVand hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.
p356
aVAnd I got pretty into it.
p357
aa(lp358
VThis is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VIt's a pair of earmuffs
p363
aVand a set of safety goggles that have been masked over
p364
aVexcept for two small pinholes,
p365
aVbecause distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.
p366
aa(lp367
VI ended up coming back to that same contest
p368
aVthat I had covered a year earlier,
p369
aVand I had this notion that I might enter it,
p370
aVsort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
p371
aVIt'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.
p372
aVProblem was, the experiment went haywire.
p373
aVI won the contest \u2014
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
Vwhich really wasn't supposed to happen.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VNow, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches
p382
aVand phone numbers and shopping lists,
p383
aVbut it's actually kind of beside the point.
p384
aVThese are just tricks.
p385
aVThey work because they're based on some pretty basic principles
p386
aVabout how our brains work.
p387
aVAnd you don't have to be building memory palaces
p388
aVor memorizing packs of playing cards
p389
aVto benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
p390
aa(lp391
VWe often talk about people with great memories
p392
aVas though it were some sort of an innate gift,
p393
aVbut that is not the case.
p394
aVGreat memories are learned.
p395
aVAt the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
p396
aVWe remember when we are deeply engaged.
p397
aVWe remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,
p398
aVand figure out why it is meaningful to us,
p399
aVwhy it is significant, why it's colorful,
p400
aVwhen we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense
p401
aVin the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,
p402
aVwhen we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.
p403
aa(lp404
VThe memory palace, these memory techniques \u2014
p405
aVthey're just shortcuts.
p406
aVIn fact, they're not even really shortcuts.
p407
aVThey work because they make you work.
p408
aVThey force a kind of depth of processing,
p409
aVa kind of mindfulness,
p410
aVthat most of us don't normally walk around exercising.
p411
aVBut there actually are no shortcuts.
p412
aVThis is how stuff is made memorable.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,
p415
aVit's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,
p416
aVleft me with,
p417
aVwhich is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
p418
aVHow much are we willing to lose
p419
aVfrom our already short lives,
p420
aVby losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,
p421
aVby not paying attention to the human being across from us
p422
aVwho is talking with us,
p423
aVby being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?
p424
aa(lp425
VI learned firsthand
p426
aVthat there are incredible memory capacities
p427
aVlatent in all of us.
p428
aVBut if you want to live a memorable life,
p429
aVyou have to be the kind of person
p430
aVwho remembers to remember.
p431
