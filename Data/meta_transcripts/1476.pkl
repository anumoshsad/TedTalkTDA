VEvidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures
p4
aVcreate their identity in some kind of narrative form.
p5
aVFrom mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,
p6
aVteacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
p7
aVWhether in cave paintings
p8
aVor the latest uses of the Internet,
p9
aVhuman beings have always told their histories and truths
p10
aVthrough parable and fable.
p11
aVWe are inveterate storytellers.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,
p14
aVdo we offer communality of experience,
p15
aVunmediated by our own furious consumerism?
p16
aVAnd what narrative, what history,
p17
aVwhat identity, what moral code
p18
aVare we imparting to our young?
p19
aa(lp20
VCinema is arguably
p21
aVthe 20th century's most influential art form.
p22
aVIts artists told stories
p23
aVacross national boundaries,
p24
aVin as many languages, genres and philosophies
p25
aVas one can imagine.
p26
aVIndeed, it is hard to find a subject
p27
aVthat film has yet to tackle.
p28
aVDuring the last decade
p29
aVwe've seen a vast integration of global media,
p30
aVnow dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
p31
aVWe are increasingly offered a diet
p32
aVin which sensation, not story, is king.
p33
aVWhat was common to us all 40 years ago \u2014
p34
aVthe telling of stories between generations \u2014
p35
aVis now rarified.
p36
aVAs a filmmaker, it worried me.
p37
aVAs a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
p38
aVWhat future could the young build
p39
aVwith so little grasp
p40
aVof where they've come from
p41
aVand so few narratives of what's possible?
p42
aVThe irony is palpable;
p43
aVtechnical access has never been greater,
p44
aVcultural access never weaker.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,
p47
aVan organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools
p48
aVfollowed by discussions.
p49
aVIf we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,
p50
aVmaybe we could build a narrative
p51
aVthat would deliver meaning
p52
aVto the fragmented and restless world of the young.
p53
aVGiven the access to technology,
p54
aVeven a school in a tiny rural hamlet
p55
aVcould project a DVD onto a white board.
p56
aa(lp57
VIn the first nine months
p58
aVwe ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,
p59
aVwith kids in age groups between five and 18
p60
aVwatching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
p61
aVThe films were curated and contextualized.
p62
aVBut the choice was theirs,
p63
aVand our audience quickly grew
p64
aVto choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
p65
aVThe outcome, immediate.
p66
aVIt was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
p67
aVIn groups as large as 150 and as small as three,
p68
aVthese young people discovered new places,
p69
aVnew thoughts, new perspectives.
p70
aVBy the time the pilot had finished,
p71
aVwe had the names of a thousand schools
p72
aVthat wished to join.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe film that changed my life
p75
aVis a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
p76
aVIt's a remarkable comment
p77
aVon slums, poverty and aspiration.
p78
aVI had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
p79
aVTechnology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,
p80
aVfind and pay for the print and the projectionist.
p81
aVBut for my father,
p82
aVthe emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great
p83
aVthat he chose to celebrate his half-century
p84
aVwith his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,
p85
aV"In order," he said,
p86
aV"to pass the baton of concern and hope
p87
aVon to the next generation."
p88
aa(lp89
VIn the last shot of "Miracle in Milan,"
p90
aVslum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
p91
aVSixty years after the film was made
p92
aVand 30 years after I first saw it,
p93
aVI see young faces tilt up in awe,
p94
aVtheir incredulity matching mine.
p95
aVAnd the speed with which they associate it
p96
aVwith "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio
p97
aVspeaks to the enduring nature.
p98
aa(lp99
VIn a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,
p100
aVwe screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
p101
aVMade in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
p102
aVFrank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
p103
aVIt shows how to do right,
p104
aVhow to be heroically awkward.
p105
aVIt is also an expression of faith
p106
aVin the political machine as a force of honor.
p107
aa(lp108
VShortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,
p109
aVthere was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
p110
aVAnd it was with great delight
p111
aVthat we found young people up and down the country
p112
aVexplaining with authority
p113
aVwhat filibustering was
p114
aVand why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
p115
aVAfter all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
p116
aa(lp117
VIn choosing "Hotel Rwanda,"
p118
aVthey explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
p119
aVIt provoked tears as well as incisive questions
p120
aVabout unarmed peace-keeping forces
p121
aVand the double-dealing of a Western society
p122
aVthat picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
p123
aVAnd when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget,
p124
aVone child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,
p125
aV"We already forgot,
p126
aVotherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"
p127
aa(lp128
VAs they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
p129
aV"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
p130
aV"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.
p131
aVThey celebrated a change in attitude
p132
aVtowards non-white Britons,
p133
aVbut railed against our restless school system
p134
aVthat does not value collective identity,
p135
aVunlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
p136
aa(lp137
VBy now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people
p138
aVthought nothing of tackling films of all forms \u2014
p139
aVblack and white, subtitled,
p140
aVdocumentary, non-narrative, fantasy \u2014
p141
aVand thought nothing of writing detailed reviews
p142
aVthat competed to favor one film over another
p143
aVin passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
p144
aVSix thousand reviews each school week
p145
aVvying for the honor of being review of the week.
p146
aa(lp147
VFrom 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,
p148
aVuntil we were nearly a quarter of a million kids
p149
aVin 7,000 clubs right across the country.
p150
aVAnd although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,
p151
aVwhat became more extraordinary
p152
aVwas how the experience of critical and curious questioning
p153
aVtranslated into life.
p154
aVSome of our kids started talking with their parents,
p155
aVothers with their teachers,
p156
aVor with their friends.
p157
aVAnd those without friends
p158
aVstarted making them.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe films provided communality across all manner of divide.
p161
aVAnd the stories they held provided a shared experience.
p162
aV"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,
p163
aVand "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy
p164
aVwas able to articulate the fear he'd experienced
p165
aVin flight from violence
p166
aVthat killed first his father then his mother,
p167
aVthe latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
p168
aa(lp169
VWho was right, who wrong?
p170
aVWhat would they do under the same conditions?
p171
aVWas the tale told well?
p172
aVWas there a hidden message?
p173
aVHow has the world changed? How could it be different?
p174
aVA tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children
p175
aVwho the world didn't think were interested.
p176
aVAnd they themselves had not known they cared.
p177
aVAnd as they wrote and debated,
p178
aVrather than seeing the films as artifacts,
p179
aVthey began to see themselves.
p180
aa(lp181
VI have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
p182
aVIn a moment she can invoke images
p183
aVof running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
p184
aVQuite recently she told me
p185
aVthat in 1948, two of her sisters and my father
p186
aVtraveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
p187
aVWhen the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,
p188
aVit was these teenagers that fed the crew.
p189
aVI was past 40 when my father died.
p190
aVHe never mentioned that journey.
p191
aa(lp192
VMy mother's mother left Europe in a hurry
p193
aVwithout her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter
p194
aVand diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
p195
aVAfter two years in hiding,
p196
aVmy grandfather appeared in London.
p197
aVHe was never right again.
p198
aVAnd his story was hushed as he assimilated.
p199
aa(lp200
VMy story started in England
p201
aVwith a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
p202
aVI had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape,"
p203
aV"Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."
p204
aVIt was Leni Riefenstahl
p205
aVin her elegant Nazi propaganda
p206
aVwho gave context to what the family had to endure.
p207
aVThese films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,
p208
aVand they became more useful to me
p209
aVthan the whispers of survivors
p210
aVand the occasional glimpse of a tattoo
p211
aVon a maiden aunt's wrist.
p212
aa(lp213
VPurists may feel that fiction dissipates
p214
aVthe quest of real human understanding,
p215
aVthat film is too crude
p216
aVto tell a complex and detailed history,
p217
aVor that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
p218
aVBut within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
p219
aVAs one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz,"
p220
aV"Every person should watch this,
p221
aVbecause unless you do
p222
aVyou may not know that you too have a heart."
p223
aa(lp224
VWe honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
p225
aVConsider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.
p226
aVAgree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson,
p227
aVoffers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding
p228
aVthat work together.
p229
aVEach a piece of memorable art,
p230
aVeach a brick in the wall of who we are.
p231
aVAnd it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks
p232
aVbetter than astronaut Jim Lovell
p233
aVor have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
p234
aVAnd though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce
p235
aVare an opportunity to discover
p236
aVwhat it is to be human,
p237
aVand no less helpful to understanding our life and times
p238
aVas Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe guessed that film,
p241
aVwhose stories are a meeting place
p242
aVof drama, music, literature and human experience,
p243
aVwould engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
p244
aVWhat we could not have foreseen
p245
aVwas the measurable improvements
p246
aVin behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
p247
aVOnce-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,
p248
aVfight, not on the playground,
p249
aVbut to choose next week's film \u2014
p250
aVyoung people who have found self-definition, ambition
p251
aVand an appetite for education and social engagement
p252
aVfrom the stories they have witnessed.
p253
aa(lp254
VOur members defy the binary description
p255
aVof how we so often describe our young.
p256
aVThey are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
p257
aVThey are, like other young people,
p258
aVnegotiating a world with infinite choice,
p259
aVbut little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
p260
aVWe appeared surprised at the behaviors
p261
aVof those who define themselves
p262
aVby the size of the tick on their shoes,
p263
aVyet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
p264
aa(lp265
VIf we want different values
p266
aVwe have to tell a different story,
p267
aVa story that understands that an individual narrative
p268
aVis an essential component of a person's identity,
p269
aVthat a collective narrative
p270
aVis an essential component of a cultural identity,
p271
aVand without it it is impossible to imagine yourself
p272
aVas part of a group.
p273
aVBecause when these people get home
p274
aVafter a screening of "Rear Window"
p275
aVand raise their gaze to the building next door,
p276
aVthey have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,
p277
aVis out there
p278
aVand what is their story.
