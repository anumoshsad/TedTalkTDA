VDo I look real to you?
p4
aVHope so.
p5
aVI have no idea if you're seeing this,
p6
aVbut I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there.
p7
aVI've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me
p8
aVso I don't walk past it and look like I'm floating in midair.
p9
aa(lp10
VRight now I'm standing
p11
aVin the open air,
p12
aVon a beach under a palm tree,
p13
aVin the exact spot where your stage used to be.
p14
aVI have 12 minutes with you.
p15
aVI set a limit.
p16
aVMy wife Navid once said
p17
aVthat infinite possibility is a creator's worst enemy.
p18
aVFor example, this dress: I'd asked her to design something
p19
aVthat a priest might have worn in 23rd-century Cairo.
p20
aVBut we only had three days to make it,
p21
aVand the only fabric we had
p22
aVwas an old duvet cover that another resident left behind.
p23
aVBut she did it, and it's perfect.
p24
aVAnd she looked at it and said,
p25
aV"Proof of concept \u2014 creation needs constraint."
p26
aVSo with these 12 minutes,
p27
aVI'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery.
p28
aa(lp29
VFor my whole life, my obsession has been eternal life,
p30
aVas I know it is so many of yours.
p31
aVYou may be happy to know that your research will pay off.
p32
aVI am 318 years old.
p33
aVThe average human lifespan is now 432 years,
p34
aVand my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely.
p35
aVAnd I've never questioned that someday,
p36
aVwe'll reach a point where we'll be content.
p37
aVBut the opposite keeps happening:
p38
aVthe longer we live, the longer we want to live,
p39
aVthe less we want to die.
p40
aa(lp41
VWho can blame us?
p42
aVThe universe is so big.
p43
aVThere won't ever not be more to see.
p44
aVJust yesterday,
p45
aVI was reading about how you can take out a boat on Europa
p46
aVand sail from island to island all over the planet,
p47
aVand some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit
p48
aVand sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.
p49
aVAnd then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter
p50
aVwho sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.
p51
aVAnd then there are others where there's no one
p52
aVand there never has been,
p53
aVand so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand
p54
aVthat no foot has ever touched before.
p55
aVYou could spend 400 years doing just that.
p56
aa(lp57
VRight now the Moon is rising in the Northeast.
p58
aVI can see the cities on it with my naked eye.
p59
aVThey're connected like nerve clusters:
p60
aVMariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator.
p61
aVAnd New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.
p62
aa(lp63
VThat's where Navid and I met.
p64
aVWe were both artists downtown.
p65
aVThe day we met, we were passing each other in Azadi Square,
p66
aVand we bumped shoulders.
p67
aVAnd I turned to apologize
p68
aVand she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything,
p69
aVsaid, "Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?"
p70
aVAnd first of all, I thought, "Who the hell are you?"
p71
aVBut second, the question annoyed me,
p72
aVbecause the answer is so simple.
p73
aVI said, "We didn't pass through each other
p74
aVbecause elementary particles have mass
p75
aVand because the space between elementary particles
p76
aVis filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of mass,
p77
aVand we've known that for 800 years."
p78
aVShe must have been in one of those moods
p79
aVwhere she likes to mess with strangers.
p80
aVOr maybe she was just flirting with me,
p81
aVbecause she looked at me and said, "I thought you'd say that.
p82
aVThink deeper."
p83
aVAnd then she took off her belt,
p84
aVthis belt that I'm wearing now,
p85
aVand she said,
p86
aV"Our universe is built so that particles have mass.
p87
aVWithout that basic constraint,
p88
aVwe'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light
p89
aVand never even known."
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd that's how our romance began.
p92
aVNavid and I
p93
aVnever ran out of things to talk about.
p94
aVNever.
p95
aVIt was incredible.
p96
aVIt was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together
p97
aVand we kept arriving at new vistas,
p98
aVand these new, perfect constellations of words
p99
aVwould come out of us to describe them.
p100
aVAnd we'd forget them as soon as we made them,
p101
aVand throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next thing, on and up.
p102
aVOr one time, Navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread,
p103
aVand that we were always adding in a little more flour
p104
aVand a little more water,
p105
aVand folding it in and turning it over
p106
aVand never getting around to baking it.
p107
aa(lp108
VIf my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch.
p109
aVShe had a genius for it.
p110
aVAll of her work revolved around it.
p111
aVMy body was like a canvas for her,
p112
aVand she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly
p113
aVthat I couldn't feel it moving.
p114
aVAnd she was obsessed with the exact moment
p115
aVwhen I would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine.
p116
aVOr she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine
p117
aVand say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?"
p118
aVI'd say, "I don't know!"
p119
aVAnd she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question,
p120
aVbut the answer I remember today is,
p121
aV"It feels good
p122
aVbecause the universe chose its constraints,
p123
aVand we are its art."
p124
aa(lp125
VIt's always funny what you think the future is going to be like
p126
aVversus what it turns out to be.
p127
aVIn your time, scientists thought humans could freeze themselves
p128
aVand wake up in the future.
p129
aVAnd they did \u2014 but then they died.
p130
aVIn your time, scientists thought humans could replace organs
p131
aVand extend life for hundreds of years.
p132
aVAnd they did,
p133
aVbut eventually, they died anyway.
p134
aVIn your time, Earth is the only place people live.
p135
aVIn my time, Earth is the place people come to die.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo when Navid started to show the signs,
p138
aVour friends assumed I would do what everyone does,
p139
aVwhich is say goodbye and send her to Earth,
p140
aVso that none of us would have to look at her
p141
aVor be around her or think about her and her ...
p142
aVfailure to keep living.
p143
aVMore than anything,
p144
aVthey didn't want to be around her actual physical body.
p145
aVThey kept referring to it as "declining,"
p146
aVeven though she herself was fascinated by it,
p147
aVthe changes it was going through,
p148
aVfollowing the rules of its nature day by day, independent of her will.
p149
aVI did send Navid to Earth.
p150
aVBut I came with her.
p151
aVI remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said,
p152
aV"I just think it's arrogant,
p153
aVlike the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special."
p154
aVBut I did.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, even here on Earth,
p157
aVI kept working on how to extend life.
p158
aVIt didn't occur to me
p159
aVthat there could be any other response.
p160
aVI kept going back to that thing that Navid said to me
p161
aVthat day in Azadi Square,
p162
aVthat without that basic constraint \u2014
p163
aVa universe that granted mass to matter \u2014
p164
aVwe would not exist.
p165
aVThat's one rule.
p166
aVAnother rule is that all mass is subject to entropy.
p167
aVAnd there is no way to be in this universe without mass.
p168
aVI know. I tried everything.
p169
aVI tried creating a photon box where the Higgs field was altered.
p170
aVI tried recording all subatomic movements in my body
p171
aVand replaying them on closed loop.
p172
aVNothing worked.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut my final innovation was to create a coil dimension
p175
aVwith the boundaries of a body in which time moved infinitely slower,
p176
aVbut whose projection would appear to move in normal time.
p177
aVThat body would then appear in our universe as a hologram \u2014
p178
aVhere but not here.
p179
aVWhen I realized I'd done it,
p180
aVI ran to her room,
p181
aVso happy to tell her I'd done it,
p182
aVmoving through space almost normally to all eyes,
p183
aVeven to my own,
p184
aVand went to lie down next to her,
p185
aVand forgot, and fell right through her.
p186
aVI'd found a way to eternal life,
p187
aVat the expense of the one thing Navid loved most,
p188
aVwhich was to touch and be touched.
p189
aVAnd she threw me out.
p190
aVI still got to watch, though.
p191
aa(lp192
VHumans live 400 years now,
p193
aVand we still die.
p194
aVAnd when death comes,
p195
aVthe dying still pick at their bedsheets,
p196
aVand their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides,
p197
aVand their breaths get further and further apart,
p198
aVlike they're falling asleep.
p199
aa(lp200
VI've always thought that
p201
aVwhat gives a life meaning is adventure.
p202
aVAnd death is just a problem
p203
aVwe haven't discovered the solution to yet.
p204
aVBut maybe a life has meaning only because it ends.
p205
aVMaybe that's the paradox:
p206
aVconstraints don't constrain, they allow perfect freedom.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Sighs)
p209
aa(lp210
VThere was a thunderstorm here this morning.
p211
aVThere is another forecast for tonight,
p212
aVbut for now the sky is clear.
p213
aVI can't feel the wind here,
p214
aVbut I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like,
p215
aVand she said it felt warm, like melted butter.
p216
aVAn answer worthy of my wife.
p217
aVI have to find my way back to the flesh.
p218
aVUntil then, I take up no space but the space you give me.
