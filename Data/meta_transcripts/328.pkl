VDogs have interests.
p4
aVThey have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.
p5
aVAnd if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
p6
aVIt's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought
p7
aVthat if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,
p8
aVand the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"
p9
aVand the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.
p10
aVI'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."
p11
aVIt's a difficult choice, right?
p12
aVRear end, owner. Rear end wins.
p13
aVI mean, you lose.
p14
aVYou cannot compete with the environment,
p15
aVif you have an adolescent dog's brain.
p16
aVSo, when we train, we're always trying to take into account
p17
aVthe dog's point of view.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, I'm here largely because
p20
aVthere's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment
p21
aVthat \u2014 on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,
p22
aVnumber one, by making up rules, human rules.
p23
aVWe don't take the dog's point of view into account.
p24
aVSo the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.
p25
aVWe're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."
p26
aVThen, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.
p27
aVAnd then number three, now we can punish the dog
p28
aVfor breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
p29
aVSo you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.
p30
aVWhen he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg \u2014
p31
aVyou know, isn't that nice?
p32
aVAnd you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
p33
aVYou bend down, you pat him \u2014 you reward him for jumping up.
p34
aVHis one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,
p35
aVhe weighs, you know, 80 pounds.
p36
aVEvery time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.
p37
aVI mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, this whole dominance issue \u2014 number one,
p40
aVwhat we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation
p41
aVof a very complicated social system.
p42
aVAnd they take this stuff seriously.
p43
aVMale dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,
p44
aVbecause it prevents physical fights.
p45
aVOf course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,
p46
aVhave several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.
p47
aVThe number one is, "I have it, you don't."
p48
aVAnd what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch
p49
aVwill quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.
p50
aVSo, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,
p51
aVor of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.
p52
aa(lp53
VDogs get so abused.
p54
aVDogs, horses and humans \u2014
p55
aVthese are the three species which are so abused in life.
p56
aVAnd the reason is built into their behavior \u2014
p57
aVis to always come back and apologize.
p58
aVLike, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."
p59
aVThey are just so beatable,
p60
aVand that's why they get beaten.
p61
aVThe poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?
p62
aV"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,
p63
aVstamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,
p64
aVhit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,
p65
aVknee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."
p66
aVBecause he grew?
p67
aVAnd because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?
p68
aVThis is insanity.
p69
aVI ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"
p70
aVAnd people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."
p71
aVI said, "Let's teach him to sit."
p72
aVAnd then we give him a reason for sitting.
p73
aVBecause the first stage
p74
aVis basically teaching a dog ESL.
p75
aVI could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
p76
aVGo on, something should happen now.
p77
aVWhy aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.
p78
aVWell, I've got news for you.
p79
aVThe dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,
p82
aVEnglish as a second language.
p83
aVAnd that's how we use the food lure in the hand,
p84
aVand we use food because we're dealing with owners.
p85
aVMy wife doesn't need food \u2014 she's a great trainer,
p86
aVmuch better than I am.
p87
aVI don't need food, but the average owner says,
p88
aV"Puppy, sit."
p89
aVOr they go, "Sit, sit, sit."
p90
aVThey're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,
p91
aVlike the dog has a third eye there \u2014 it's insane.
p92
aVYou know, "Sit, sit."
p93
aVNo, we go, "Puppy, sit" \u2014 boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.
p94
aa(lp95
VThen we phase out the food as a lure,
p96
aVand now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,
p97
aVand you can actually communicate to a dog
p98
aVin a perfectly constructed English sentence.
p99
aV"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."
p100
aVAnd I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"
p101
aVand the name of my son, "Jamie."
p102
aVAnd the dog can take a note,
p103
aVand I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
p104
aVHe'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,
p105
aVwherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,
p106
aVand take him a little message that says,
p107
aV"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
p108
aa(lp109
VSo, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
p110
aVWill it do it?
p111
aVNot necessarily, no.
p112
aVAs I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,
p113
aVwhy come to the owner?
p114
aVThe dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.
p115
aVThe dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.
p116
aVAt the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing
p117
aVwith smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do
p120
aVwhat we want him to do, and this is very easy.
p121
aVWe use the Premack principle.
p122
aVBasically, we follow a low-frequency behavior \u2014
p123
aVone the dog doesn't want to do \u2014
p124
aVby a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,
p125
aVor a dog hobby \u2014 something the dog does like to do.
p126
aVThat will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.
p127
aVSo we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"
p128
aVlook, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.
p129
aVYes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.
p130
aV"Sit," sniff butt.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo now all of these distractions that worked against training
p133
aVnow become rewards that work for training.
p134
aVAnd what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like \u2014
p135
aVwe're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.
p136
aVAnd I can imagine this dog, you know,
p137
aVspeaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,
p138
aVsaying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.
p139
aVThey're like Golden Retrievers.
p140
aVAll I have to do is sit, and they do everything.
p141
aVThey open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,
p142
aVthey will throw tennis balls,
p143
aVthey will cook for me and serve the food.
p144
aVIt's like, if I just sit, that's my command.
p145
aVThen I have my own personal doorman,
p146
aVchauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
p147
aVAnd now the dog's really happy.
p148
aVAnd this, to me, is always what training is.
p149
aVSo we really motivate the dog to want to do it,
p150
aVsuch that the need for punishment seldom comes up.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow we move to phase three, when now \u2014
p153
aVthere's times, you know, when daddy knows best.
p154
aVAnd I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,
p155
aV"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
p156
aVSorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."
p157
aVAnd there's times, for example,
p158
aVif my son's friends leave the door open,
p159
aVthe dogs have to know you don't step across this line.
p160
aVThis is a life-or-death thing.
p161
aVYou leave this, the sanctity of your house,
p162
aVand you could be hit on the street.
p163
aVSo some things we have to let the dog know,
p164
aV"You mustn't do this."
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd so we have to enforce, but without force.
p167
aVPeople here get very confused about what a punishment is.
p168
aVThey think a punishment is something nasty.
p169
aVI bet a lot of you do, right?
p170
aVYou think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
p171
aVIt doesn't have to be.
p172
aVThere's several definitions of what a punishment is,
p173
aVbut one definition, the most popular, is:
p174
aVa punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,
p175
aVsuch that it's less likely to occur in the future.
p176
aVIt does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
p177
aVAnd I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.
p178
aa(lp179
VI was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
p180
aVAnd this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,
p181
aVplus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
p182
aVAnd I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,
p183
aVand they never took it outside.
p184
aVThe dog is actually euthanized now,
p185
aVbut this was a dog I worked with for a while.
p186
aVA lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,
p187
aVso while I was there \u2014 this was on the fourth visit \u2014
p188
aVwe did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.
p189
aVAnd he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.
p190
aVWhen the dog would try to leave the mat,
p191
aVshe would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."
p192
aVThe dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,
p193
aVbecause we had a lot of aggression related towards food.
p194
aVThe breaks got fewer and fewer.
p195
aVYou see, the punishment was working.
p196
aVThe behavior problem was going away.
p197
aVShe never raised her voice.
p198
aVIf she did, she would have got bitten.
p199
aVIt's not a good dog you shout at.
p200
aVAnd a lot of my friends train really neat animals,
p201
aVgrizzly bears \u2014 if you've ever seen a grizzly bear
p202
aVon the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it \u2014
p203
aVkiller whales. I love it because it wires you up.
p204
aVHow are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?
p205
aV"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!
p206
aVYour head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?
p207
aVThis is crazy.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, where do we go from here?
p210
aVWe want a better way.
p211
aVDogs deserve better.
p212
aVBut for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
p213
aVIt has to do with watching people train puppies,
p214
aVand realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,
p215
aVhorrendous relationship skills.
p216
aVNot just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.
p217
aVI mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.
p218
aVYou see someone in the park \u2014 and I'll cover my mic when I say this,
p219
aVbecause I don't want to wake you up \u2014 and there's the owner in the park,
p220
aVand their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.
p221
aVRover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."
p222
aVThe dog says, "I don't think so."
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVI mean, who in their right mind
p225
aVwould think that a dog would want to approach them
p226
aVwhen they're screaming like that?
p227
aVInstead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.
p228
aVPreviously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."
p229
aVI was walking onto a plane \u2014
p230
aVthis, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,
p231
aVand it really cemented what I wanted to do
p232
aVwith this whole puppy-training thing,
p233
aVthe notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way
p234
aVto want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.
p235
aVYou know, I puppy-train my child.
p236
aVAnd the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,
p237
aVand in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,
p238
aVkicking the back of the chair.
p239
aV"Johnny, don't do that."
p240
aVKick, kick, kick.
p241
aV"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.
p242
aVI'm standing right here with my bag.
p243
aVThe father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.
p244
aVAnd ugly face is this \u2014
p245
aVwhen you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,
p246
aVyou say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"
p247
aVAnd I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"
p248
aVThat child has lost everything \u2014
p249
aVthat one of the two people he can trust in this world
p250
aVhas absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.
p251
aVAnd I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"
p252
aVI thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."
p253
aVI walked to the back of the plane,
p254
aVI sat down, and a thought came to me.
p255
aVIf that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVIf he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.
p258
aVHe kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd this is what it's all about.
p261
aVThese relationship skills are so easy.
p262
aVI mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate
p263
aVbased on the three Cs \u2014 coat color, conformation, cuteness.
p264
aVYou know, kind of like a little robot.
p265
aVThis is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.
p266
aVAnd then, a little behavior problem comes up.
p267
aVNo different from the dog barking.
p268
aVThe husband won't clear up his clothes,
p269
aVor the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
p270
aVAnd it then starts, and we get into this thing,
p271
aVand our personal feedback \u2014 there's two things about it.
p272
aVWhen you watch people interacting with animals or other people,
p273
aVthere is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
p274
aVAnd when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
p275
aVYou see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,
p276
aVespecially with children, especially with parents.
p277
aVYou see it especially in the workplace,
p278
aVespecially from boss to employee.
p279
aVIt's as if there's some schadenfreude there,
p280
aVthat we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,
p281
aVso that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.
p284
aVIt really is.
p285
aVWe take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.
p286
aVAnd I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.
p287
aVYou know, calculus is wonderful.
p288
aVWhen I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.
p289
aVI don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
p290
aVGeometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics \u2014
p291
aVthese are cool things.
p292
aVBut they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd my look to the future is,
p295
aVand what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people
p296
aVthat you know, your husband's just as easy to train.
p297
aVProbably easier \u2014 if you got a Rottie \u2014 much easier to train.
p298
aVYour kids are easy to train.
p299
aVAll you've got to do is to watch them,
p300
aVto time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,
p301
aVyou ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
p302
aVIf it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
p303
aVThat is such a powerful training technique.
p304
aVThis should be taught in schools.
p305
aVRelationships \u2014 how do you negotiate?
p306
aVHow you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?
p307
aVYou know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?
p308
aVHow on earth about raising children?
p309
aVWe think how we do it \u2014 one night in bed, we're pregnant,
p310
aVand then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.
p311
aVNo, this is what should be taught \u2014 the good living, the good habits,
p312
aVwhich are just as hard to break as bad habits.
p313
aVSo, that would be my wish to the future.
p314
aVAh, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,
p315
aVbut I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two \u2014
p316
aVso thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.
