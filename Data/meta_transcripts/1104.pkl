VI want you now to imagine
p4
aVa wearable robot
p5
aVthat gives you superhuman abilities,
p6
aVor another one that takes wheelchair users
p7
aVup standing and walking again.
p8
aVWe at Berkeley Bionics
p9
aVcall these robots exoskeletons.
p10
aVThese are nothing else
p11
aVthan something that you put on in the morning,
p12
aVand it will give you extra strength,
p13
aVand it will further enhance your speed,
p14
aVand it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
p15
aVIt is actually the true integration
p16
aVof the man and the machine.
p17
aVBut not only that \u2014
p18
aVit will integrate and network you
p19
aVto the universe
p20
aVand other devices out there.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is just not some blue sky thinking.
p23
aVTo show you now what we are working on
p24
aVby starting out talking about
p25
aVthe American soldier,
p26
aVthat on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,
p27
aVand they are being asked to carry more equipment.
p28
aVObviously, this is resulting
p29
aVin some major complications \u2014
p30
aVback injuries, 30 percent of them \u2014
p31
aVchronic back injuries.
p32
aVSo we thought we would look at this challenge
p33
aVand create an exoskeleton
p34
aVthat would help deal with this issue.
p35
aVSo let me now introduce to you HULC \u2014
p36
aVor the Human Universal
p37
aVLoad Carrier.
p38
aa(lp39
VSoldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,
p40
aVI can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain
p41
aVfor many hours.
p42
aVIts flexible design allows for deep squats,
p43
aVcrawls and high-agility movements.
p44
aVIt senses what I want to do, where I want to go,
p45
aVand then augments my strength and endurance.
p46
aa(lp47
VEythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner
p48
aVto introduce this device,
p49
aVthis new exoskeleton this year.
p50
aVSo this is for real.
p51
aVNow let's turn our heads
p52
aVtowards the wheelchair users,
p53
aVsomething that I'm particularly passionate about.
p54
aVThere are 68 million people
p55
aVestimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.
p56
aVThis is about one percent of the total population.
p57
aVAnd that's actually a conservative estimate.
p58
aVWe are talking here about, oftentimes,
p59
aVvery young individuals with spinal cord injuries,
p60
aVthat in the prime of their life \u2014 20s, 30s, 40s \u2014
p61
aVhit a wall
p62
aVand the wheelchair's the only option.
p63
aVBut it is also the aging population
p64
aVthat is multiplying in numbers.
p65
aVAnd the only option, pretty much \u2014
p66
aVwhen it's stroke or other complications \u2014
p67
aVis the wheelchair.
p68
aVAnd that is actually for the last 500 years,
p69
aVsince its very successful introduction, I must say.
p70
aVSo we thought we would start
p71
aVwriting a brand new chapter
p72
aVof mobility.
p73
aVLet me now introduce you to eLEGS
p74
aVthat is worn by Amanda Boxtel
p75
aVthat 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,
p76
aVand as a result of that
p77
aVshe has not been able to walk
p78
aVfor 19 years until now.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VAmanda Boxtel: Thank you.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VEB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
p87
aVIt has sensors.
p88
aVIt's completely non-invasive,
p89
aVsensors in the crutches
p90
aVthat send signals back to our onboard computer
p91
aVthat is sitting here at her back.
p92
aVThere are battery packs here as well
p93
aVthat power motors that are sitting at her hips,
p94
aVas well as her knee joints,
p95
aVthat move her forward
p96
aVin this kind of smooth and very natural gait.
p97
aa(lp98
VAB: I was 24 years old
p99
aVand at the top of my game
p100
aVwhen a freak summersault while downhill skiing
p101
aVparalyzed me.
p102
aVIn a split second,
p103
aVI lost all sensation and movement
p104
aVbelow my pelvis.
p105
aVNot long afterwards,
p106
aVa doctor strode into my hospital room,
p107
aVand he said, "Amanda,
p108
aVyou'll never walk again."
p109
aVAnd that was 19 yeas ago.
p110
aVHe robbed
p111
aVevery ounce of hope
p112
aVfrom my being.
p113
aVAdaptive technology
p114
aVhas since enabled me
p115
aVto learn how to downhill ski again,
p116
aVto rock climb and even handcycle.
p117
aVBut nothing has been invented
p118
aVthat enables me to walk,
p119
aVuntil now.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VEB: As you can see,
p128
aVwe have the technology,
p129
aVwe have the platforms
p130
aVto sit down and have discussions with you.
p131
aVIt's in our hands,
p132
aVand we have all the potential here
p133
aVto change the lives
p134
aVof future generations \u2014
p135
aVnot only for the soldiers,
p136
aVor for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,
p137
aVbut for everyone.
p138
aa(lp139
VAB: Thanks.
