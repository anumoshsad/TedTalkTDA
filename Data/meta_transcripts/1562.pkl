VSo, embryonic stem cells
p4
aVare really incredible cells.
p5
aVThey are our body's own repair kits,
p6
aVand they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into
p7
aVall of the cells in our bodies.
p8
aVSoon, we actually will be able to use stem cells
p9
aVto replace cells that are damaged or diseased.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut that's not what I want to talk to you about,
p12
aVbecause right now there are some really
p13
aVextraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
p14
aVthat are completely changing
p15
aVthe way we look and model disease,
p16
aVour ability to understand why we get sick,
p17
aVand even develop drugs.
p18
aVI truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow
p19
aVour children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes
p20
aVand other major diseases the way we view polio today,
p21
aVwhich is as a preventable disease.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo here we have this incredible field, which has
p24
aVenormous hope for humanity,
p25
aVbut much like IVF over 35 years ago,
p26
aVuntil the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,
p27
aVthis field has been under siege politically and financially.
p28
aVCritical research is being challenged instead of supported,
p29
aVand we saw that it was really essential to have
p30
aVprivate safe haven laboratories where this work
p31
aVcould be advanced without interference.
p32
aVAnd so, in 2005,
p33
aVwe started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory
p34
aVso that we would have a small organization that could
p35
aVdo this work and support it.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhat we saw very quickly is the world of both medical
p38
aVresearch, but also developing drugs and treatments,
p39
aVis dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,
p40
aVbut in a new field, sometimes large organizations
p41
aVreally have trouble getting out of their own way,
p42
aVand sometimes they can't ask the right questions,
p43
aVand there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger
p44
aVbetween academic research on the one hand
p45
aVand pharmaceutical companies and biotechs
p46
aVthat are responsible for delivering all of our drugs
p47
aVand many of our treatments, and so we knew that
p48
aVto really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going
p49
aVto have to address this with two things:
p50
aVnew technologies and also a new research model.
p51
aVBecause if you don't close that gap, you really are
p52
aVexactly where we are today.
p53
aVAnd that's what I want to focus on.
p54
aVWe've spent the last couple of years pondering this,
p55
aVmaking a list of the different things that we had to do,
p56
aVand so we developed a new technology,
p57
aVIt's software and hardware,
p58
aVthat actually can generate thousands and thousands of
p59
aVgenetically diverse stem cell lines to create
p60
aVa global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.
p61
aVAnd we did this because we think that it's actually going
p62
aVto allow us to realize the potential, the promise,
p63
aVof all of the sequencing of the human genome,
p64
aVbut it's going to allow us, in doing that,
p65
aVto actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,
p66
aVnot animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments
p67
aVthat are much more effective, much safer,
p68
aVmuch faster, and at a much lower cost.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo let me put that in perspective for you
p71
aVand give you some context.
p72
aVThis is an extremely new field.
p73
aVIn 1998, human embryonic stem cells
p74
aVwere first identified, and just nine years later,
p75
aVa group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells
p76
aVand reprogram them with very powerful viruses
p77
aVto create a kind of pluripotent stem cell
p78
aVcalled an induced pluripotent stem cell,
p79
aVor what we refer to as an IPS cell.
p80
aVThis was really an extraordinary advance, because
p81
aValthough these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,
p82
aVwhich still remain the gold standard,
p83
aVthey are terrific to use for modeling disease
p84
aVand potentially for drug discovery.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists
p87
aVbuilt on that research. He took skin biopsies,
p88
aVthis time from people who had a disease,
p89
aVALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.
p90
aVHe turned them into the IPS cells
p91
aVthat I've just told you about, and then he turned those
p92
aVIPS cells into the motor neurons that actually
p93
aVwere dying in the disease.
p94
aVSo basically what he did was to take a healthy cell
p95
aVand turn it into a sick cell,
p96
aVand he recapitulated the disease over and over again
p97
aVin the dish, and this was extraordinary,
p98
aVbecause it was the first time that we had a model
p99
aVof a disease from a living patient in living human cells.
p100
aVAnd as he watched the disease unfold, he was able
p101
aVto discover that actually the motor neurons were dying
p102
aVin the disease in a different way than the field
p103
aVhad previously thought. There was another kind of cell
p104
aVthat actually was sending out a toxin
p105
aVand contributing to the death of these motor neurons,
p106
aVand you simply couldn't see it
p107
aVuntil you had the human model.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo you could really say that
p110
aVresearchers trying to understand the cause of disease
p111
aVwithout being able to have human stem cell models
p112
aVwere much like investigators trying to figure out
p113
aVwhat had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash
p114
aVwithout having a black box, or a flight recorder.
p115
aVThey could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,
p116
aVbut they really had no way of knowing what led
p117
aVto the terrible events.
p118
aVAnd stem cells really have given us the black box
p119
aVfor diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.
p120
aVIt really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate
p121
aVmany, many diseases in a dish, you can see
p122
aVwhat begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation
p123
aVwell before you would ever see
p124
aVsymptoms appear in a patient.
p125
aVAnd this opens up the ability,
p126
aVwhich hopefully will become something that
p127
aVis routine in the near term,
p128
aVof using human cells to test for drugs.
p129
aa(lp130
VRight now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.
p131
aVTo bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,
p132
aV13 years \u2014 that's one drug \u2014
p133
aVwith a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,
p134
aVand only one percent of the drugs that start down that road
p135
aVare actually going to get there.
p136
aVYou can't imagine other businesses
p137
aVthat you would think of going into
p138
aVthat have these kind of numbers.
p139
aVIt's a terrible business model.
p140
aVBut it is really a worse social model because of
p141
aVwhat's involved and the cost to all of us.
p142
aVSo the way we develop drugs now
p143
aVis by testing promising compounds on \u2014
p144
aVWe didn't have disease modeling with human cells,
p145
aVso we'd been testing them on cells of mice
p146
aVor other creatures or cells that we engineer,
p147
aVbut they don't have the characteristics of the diseases
p148
aVthat we're actually trying to cure.
p149
aVYou know, we're not mice, and you can't go into
p150
aVa living person with an illness
p151
aVand just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells
p152
aVand then start fooling around in a lab to test
p153
aVfor, you know, a promising drug.
p154
aVBut what you can do with human stem cells, now,
p155
aVis actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,
p156
aVwhether it's the live motor neurons
p157
aVor the beating cardiac cells or liver cells
p158
aVor other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,
p159
aVpromising compounds, on the actual cells
p160
aVthat you're trying to affect, and this is now,
p161
aVand it's absolutely extraordinary,
p162
aVand you're going to know at the beginning,
p163
aVthe very early stages of doing your assay development
p164
aVand your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years
p165
aVuntil you've brought a drug to market, only to find out
p166
aVthat actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut it isn't really enough just to look at
p169
aVthe cells from a few people or a small group of people,
p170
aVbecause we have to step back.
p171
aVWe've got to look at the big picture.
p172
aVLook around this room. We are all different,
p173
aVand a disease that I might have,
p174
aVif I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,
p175
aVit probably would affect me differently than if
p176
aVone of you had that disease,
p177
aVand if we both had Parkinson's disease,
p178
aVand we took the same medication,
p179
aVbut we had different genetic makeup,
p180
aVwe probably would have a different result,
p181
aVand it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully
p182
aVfor me was actually ineffective for you,
p183
aVand similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you
p184
aVis safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,
p185
aVbut unfortunately it is not the way
p186
aVthat the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs
p187
aVbecause, until now, it hasn't had the tools.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd so we need to move away
p190
aVfrom this one-size-fits-all model.
p191
aVThe way we've been developing drugs is essentially
p192
aVlike going into a shoe store,
p193
aVno one asks you what size you are, or
p194
aVif you're going dancing or hiking.
p195
aVThey just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."
p196
aVIt doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are
p197
aVmany times more complicated than just our feet.
p198
aVSo we really have to change this.
p199
aa(lp200
VThere was a very sad example of this in the last decade.
p201
aVThere's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,
p202
aVbut the particular drug was Vioxx, and
p203
aVfor people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,
p204
aVthe drug was an absolute lifesaver,
p205
aVbut unfortunately, for another subset of those people,
p206
aVthey suffered pretty severe heart side effects,
p207
aVand for a subset of those people, the side effects were
p208
aVso severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.
p209
aVBut imagine a different scenario,
p210
aVwhere we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,
p211
aVof cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested
p212
aVthat drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,
p213
aVwell, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have
p214
aVcardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups
p215
aVor genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,
p216
aVare not going to have any problems.
p217
aVThe people for whom it was a lifesaver
p218
aVcould have still taken their medicine.
p219
aVThe people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,
p220
aVwould never have been given it, and
p221
aVyou can imagine a very different outcome for the company,
p222
aVwho had to withdraw the drug.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo that is terrific,
p225
aVand we thought, all right,
p226
aVas we're trying to solve this problem,
p227
aVclearly we have to think about genetics,
p228
aVwe have to think about human testing,
p229
aVbut there's a fundamental problem,
p230
aVbecause right now, stem cell lines,
p231
aVas extraordinary as they are,
p232
aVand lines are just groups of cells,
p233
aVthey are made by hand, one at a time,
p234
aVand it takes a couple of months.
p235
aVThis is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,
p236
aVeven in the best laboratories,
p237
aVyou have variations in techniques,
p238
aVand you need to know, if you're making a drug,
p239
aVthat the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle
p240
aVon Monday is the same as the Aspirin
p241
aVthat's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.
p242
aVSo we looked at this, and we thought, okay,
p243
aVartisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing
p244
aVand your bread and crafts, but
p245
aVartisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,
p246
aVso we have to deal with this.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut even with that, there still was another big hurdle,
p249
aVand that actually brings us back to
p250
aVthe mapping of the human genome, because
p251
aVwe're all different.
p252
aVWe know from the sequencing of the human genome
p253
aVthat it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's
p254
aVthat make up our genetic code,
p255
aVbut that code, by itself, our DNA,
p256
aVis like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code
p257
aVwithout having a computer that can read it.
p258
aVIt's like having an app without having a smartphone.
p259
aVWe needed to have a way of bringing the biology
p260
aVto that incredible data,
p261
aVand the way to do that was to find
p262
aVa stand-in, a biological stand-in,
p263
aVthat could contain all of the genetic information,
p264
aVbut have it be arrayed in such a way
p265
aVas it could be read together
p266
aVand actually create this incredible avatar.
p267
aVWe need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types
p268
aVthat represent who we are.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo this is what we've built.
p271
aVIt's an automated robotic technology.
p272
aVIt has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands
p273
aVof stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.
p274
aVIt has massively parallel processing capability,
p275
aVand it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,
p276
aVwe hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen
p277
aVis that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,
p278
aVon arrays like this, that already exist,
p279
aVall of the drugs that currently exist,
p280
aVand in the future, you're going to be taking drugs
p281
aVand treatments that have been tested for side effects
p282
aVon all of the relevant cells,
p283
aVon brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
p284
aa(lp285
VIt really has brought us to the threshold
p286
aVof personalized medicine.
p287
aVIt's here now, and in our family,
p288
aVmy son has type 1 diabetes,
p289
aVwhich is still an incurable disease,
p290
aVand I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,
p291
aVbut I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,
p292
aVbecause probably a version of it is your story.
p293
aVAt some point in our lives, all of us,
p294
aVor people we care about, become patients,
p295
aVand that's why I think that stem cell research
p296
aVis incredibly important for all of us.
