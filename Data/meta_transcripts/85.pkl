VI thought in getting up to my TED wish
p4
aVI would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do
p5
aVand how it fits with what they try to do.
p6
aVWe live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,
p7
aVbut insufficient in three major ways.
p8
aVIt is, first of all, profoundly unequal:
p9
aVhalf the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;
p10
aVa billion people with no access to clean water;
p11
aVtwo and a half billion no access to sanitation;
p12
aVa billion going to bed hungry every night;
p13
aVone in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria
p14
aVand the variety of infections associated with dirty water \u2014
p15
aV80 percent of them under five years of age.
p16
aa(lp17
VEven in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.
p18
aVIn the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,
p19
aVfive years of productivity growth in the workplace,
p20
aVbut median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families
p21
aVdropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.
p22
aVThe percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
p23
aVSo this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us \u2014
p24
aVwhich is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do
p25
aVfor a living, enjoying this evening \u2014 is profoundly unequal.
p26
aVIt is also unstable.
p27
aVUnstable because of the threats of terror,
p28
aVweapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease
p29
aVand a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.
p30
aVAnd perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable
p31
aVbecause of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.
p32
aa(lp33
VWhen I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter
p34
aVand the grandchildren I hope to have,
p35
aVit is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable
p36
aVinterdependence to integrated communities \u2014 locally, nationally and globally \u2014
p37
aVthat share the characteristics of all successful communities:
p38
aVa broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,
p39
aVa shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise
p40
aVand a genuine sense of belonging.
p41
aVAll easier said than done.
p42
aVWhen the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,
p43
aVI think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,
p44
aVI think the thing that troubled the British most
p45
aVwas that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens
p46
aVwhose religious and political identities were more important to them
p47
aVthan the people they grew up with, went to school with,
p48
aVworked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.
p49
aVIn other words, they thought their differences
p50
aVwere more important than their common humanity.
p51
aVIt is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.
p52
aa(lp53
VInto this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,
p54
aVhave more power to do good than at any time in history,
p55
aVbecause more than half the world's people
p56
aVlive under governments they voted in and can vote out.
p57
aVAnd even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.
p58
aVBecause primarily of the power of the Internet,
p59
aVpeople of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money
p60
aVthat can change the world for some public good if they all agree.
p61
aVWhen the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.
p62
aV30 percent of our households gave.
p63
aVHalf of them gave over the Internet.
p64
aVThe median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.
p65
aVAnd thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.
p66
aVThey, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power
p67
aVto affect the lives of our fellow human beings.
p68
aVWhen I became president in 1993,
p69
aVthere were none of these organizations in Russia.
p70
aVThere are now a couple of hundred thousand.
p71
aVNone in India. There are now at least a half a million active.
p72
aVNone in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,
p73
aVprobably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is
p76
aVand the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,
p77
aVand I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life
p78
aVthat I could still have an impact on.
p79
aVI wanted to focus on activities
p80
aVthat would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,
p81
aVbridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,
p82
aVbut to do it in a way that would either use
p83
aVwhatever particular skills we could put together in our group
p84
aVto change the way some public good function was performed
p85
aVso that it would sweep across the world more.
p86
aa(lp87
VYou saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.
p88
aVAnd I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,
p89
aVand the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,
p90
aVIra Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.
p91
aVHe's over there.
p92
aV(Applause)
p93
aVWhen I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,
p94
aVto try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,
p95
aVgeneric drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.
p96
aVIf you bought them in vast bulks,
p97
aVyou could get them at a little under 400 dollars.
p98
aVThe first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,
p99
aVwas paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.
p100
aVThe market was so terribly disorganized
p101
aVthat they were buying this medicine through two agents
p102
aVwho were gigging them sevenfold.
p103
aVSo the very first week we were working,
p104
aVwe got the price down to 500 dollars.
p105
aVAnd all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives
p106
aVfor the same amount of money.
p107
aa(lp108
VThen we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,
p109
aVone of whom was cited in the film,
p110
aVand negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,
p111
aVbecause even at 500 dollars, these drugs
p112
aVwere being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.
p113
aVSo we worked on improving the productivity of the operations
p114
aVand the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,
p115
aVabsolutely certain-payment business.
p116
aVI joked that the main contribution we made
p117
aVto the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers
p118
aVto change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.
p119
aVBut the price went to 140 dollars from 500.
p120
aVAnd pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.
p121
aVNow we can get it for about 100 dollars.
p122
aVChildren's medicine was 600 dollars,
p123
aVbecause nobody could afford to buy any of it.
p124
aVWe negotiated it down to 190.
p125
aVThen, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax
p126
aVto create a something called UNITAID,
p127
aVgot a bunch of other countries to help.
p128
aVThat children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives
p131
aVof everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive
p132
aVare the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care
p133
aVfor people and deliver this medicine.
p134
aVWe started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.
p135
aVWe tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals
p136
aVwith the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric
p137
aVand other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.
p138
aVWe just reorganized the markets.
p139
aVAnd it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,
p140
aVsomebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.
p141
aVAnd that is now what we're trying to do,
p142
aVand working with this large cities group to fight climate change,
p143
aVto negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities
p144
aVwhich generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,
p145
aVto drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
p146
aVin a way that is good economics.
p147
aVAnd this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,
p148
aVis a mystery to me.
p149
aVI think it's a bird's nest on the ground.
p150
aa(lp151
VWhen Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar
p152
aVfor the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,
p153
aVbut I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.
p154
aVFor those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"
p155
aVthe most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,
p156
aVwhich shows here's where greenhouse gases are going
p157
aVif we don't do anything, here's where they could go.
p158
aVAnd then there are six different categories
p159
aVof things we can do to change the trajectory.
p160
aVWe need a movie on those six categories.
p161
aVAnd all of you need to have it embedded in your brains
p162
aVand to organize yourselves around it.
p163
aVSo we're trying to do that.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.
p166
aVNow we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.
p167
aVIt has been my experience in working in developing countries
p168
aVthat while the headlines may all be \u2014 the pessimistic headlines may say,
p169
aVwell, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption \u2014
p170
aVI think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,
p171
aVand feeds corruption.
p172
aVWe now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute
p173
aVAIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.
p174
aVToday these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,
p175
aVand in a total of 62 countries,
p176
aVand about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.
p177
aVBut the money is there to reach others.
p178
aVThe systems are not there to reach the people.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what we have been trying to do,
p181
aVworking first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places \u2014
p182
aVbut I want to talk about Rwanda tonight \u2014
p183
aVis to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area
p184
aVthat can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,
p185
aVmaternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues
p186
aVpoor people are grappling with in the developing world,
p187
aVthat can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,
p188
aVand then will be a model that could literally
p189
aVbe implemented in any other poor country in the world.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd the test is: one, will it do the job?
p192
aVWill it provide high quality care?
p193
aVAnd two, will it do it at a price
p194
aVthat will enable the country to sustain a health care system
p195
aVwithout foreign donors after five to 10 years?
p196
aVBecause the longer I deal with these problems,
p197
aVthe more convinced I am that we have to \u2014
p198
aVwhether it's economics, health, education, whatever \u2014
p199
aVwe have to build systems.
p200
aVAnd the absence of systems that function
p201
aVbreak the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.
p202
aVYou think about whatever your life has been,
p203
aVhowever many obstacles you have faced in your life,
p204
aVat critical junctures you always knew
p205
aVthere was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted
p206
aVand the result you achieved.
p207
aVIn a world with no systems, with chaos,
p208
aVeverything becomes a guerilla struggle,
p209
aVand this predictability is not there.
p210
aVAnd it becomes almost impossible to save lives,
p211
aVeducate kids, develop economies, whatever.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe person, in my view,
p214
aVwho has done the best job of this in the health care area,
p215
aVof building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,
p216
aVwho, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,
p217
aVPartners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,
p218
aVbut they've also worked in Russia, in Peru
p219
aVand other places around the world.
p220
aVAs poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active \u2014
p221
aVand they serve a catchment area far greater
p222
aVthan the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve \u2014
p223
aVsince 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.
p224
aVAnd they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.
p225
aVSo when we decided to work in Rwanda
p226
aVon trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,
p227
aVwe wanted to build a healthcare network,
p228
aVbecause it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,
p229
aVand the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.
p230
aVSo I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.
p231
aVBecause it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti
p232
aVand a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,
p233
aVnumber one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country
p234
aVthat has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,
p235
aVand number two, we would have something that could then be adapted
p236
aVto any other poor country anywhere in the world.
p237
aVAnd so we have set about doing that.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, we started working together 18 months ago.
p240
aVAnd we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,
p241
aVwhich is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,
p242
aVwith a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.
p243
aVWe're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:
p244
aVhe develops and trains paid community health workers
p245
aVwho are able to identify health problems,
p246
aVensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed
p247
aVand take their medicine regularly,
p248
aVwho work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,
p249
aVproviding nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care
p250
aVif they have problems of the severity that require it.
p251
aVThe procedures that make this work have been perfected,
p252
aVas I said, by Paul Farmer and his team
p253
aVin their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.
p254
aVRecently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.
p255
aVAnd the results were so good that the Rwandan government
p256
aVhas now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,
p257
aVand has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.
p258
aa(lp259
VI'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.
p260
aVWe have about 500 people around the world
p261
aVworking in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing \u2014
p262
aVjust for transportation, room and board.
p263
aVAnd then we have others working in these other related programs.
p264
aVOur business plan in Rwanda
p265
aVwas put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,
p266
aVwho is an unusually gifted woman,
p267
aVbut not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.
p268
aVShe was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.
p269
aVShe was CEO of a successful e-venture \u2014
p270
aVshe started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures \u2014
p271
aVand at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.
p272
aVSo she now works full-time on this for very little pay.
p273
aVShe and her team of former business people have created a business plan
p274
aVthat will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.
p275
aVAnd it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work
p276
aVshe used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.
p277
aa(lp278
VWhen we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five
p279
aVhad stunted growth due to malnutrition.
p280
aV23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.
p281
aVMortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.
p282
aVOver 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred
p283
aVbecause of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation \u2014
p284
aVall entirely preventable and treatable.
p285
aVOver 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses \u2014
p286
aVagain, all preventable and treatable.
p287
aVAnd not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.
p288
aa(lp289
VWithin the first 18 months, the following things happened:
p290
aVwe went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.
p291
aVThat's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.
p292
aVListen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated
p293
aVstopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.
p294
aVThat's lower than the figure in the United States.
p295
aVLess than three-tenths of one percent
p296
aVhad to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.
p297
aV400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling
p298
aVand will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.
p299
aVThat's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.
p300
aVAbout 40 percent of all the people \u2014 I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.
p301
aVAbout 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it \u2014
p302
aVin just 18 months, up from zero when we started.
p303
aV43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program
p304
aVto prevent malnutrition and early death
p305
aVare now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.
p306
aa(lp307
VWe've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.
p308
aVPatients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide
p309
aVthat we have renovated along with four other clinics,
p310
aVcomplete with solar power generators, good lab technology.
p311
aVWe now are treating 325 people a month,
p312
aVdespite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.
p313
aVAnd the most important thing is
p314
aVbecause we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,
p315
aVwe estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda
p316
aVfor between five and six percent of GDP,
p317
aVand that the government could sustain that
p318
aVwithout depending on foreign aid after five or six years.
p319
aVAnd for those of you who understand healthcare economics
p320
aVyou know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP
p321
aVon health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 \u2014
p322
aVbut that's a story for another day.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VWe're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda
p326
aVand our Foundation folks to scale this system up.
p327
aVWe're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.
p328
aVAnd we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,
p329
aVKenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:
p330
aVto save as many lives as quickly as we can,
p331
aVbut to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide
p332
aVand then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.
p333
aVWe need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,
p334
aVhealth administration and community health workers throughout the country,
p335
aVto set up the information technology, the solar energy,
p336
aVthe water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.
p337
aVBut over a five- to 10-year period,
p338
aVwe will take down the need for outside assistance
p339
aVand eventually it will be phased out.
p340
aa(lp341
VMy wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build
p342
aVa high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,
p343
aVthat can be a model for Africa,
p344
aVand indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.
p345
aVMy belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world
p346
aVwith more partners and fewer terrorists,
p347
aVwith more productive citizens and fewer haters,
p348
aVa place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.
p349
aVIt has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda
p350
aVwhere we also have a major economic development project
p351
aVin partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,
p352
aVwhere last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,
p353
aVcut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent
p354
aVand achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases
p355
aVin crop yields with the farmers.
p356
aa(lp357
VThese people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,
p358
aVhelped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.
p359
aVWe're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.
p360
aVWe're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.
p361
aVI'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid
p362
aVto the 35 percent of the people that have no access,
p363
aVbut to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,
p364
aVthe Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,
p365
aVin preserving their topsoil.
p366
aVThere's a couple of guys from southern farming families \u2014
p367
aVthe first thing I did when I went out to this place
p368
aVwas to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt
p369
aVand see what they'd done with it.
p370
aa(lp371
VWe have a chance here to prove that a country
p372
aVthat almost slaughtered itself out of existence
p373
aVcan practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow
p374
aVand provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
p375
aVI am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.
p376
aVWe could use some more help to do this,
p377
aVbut think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system
p378
aVin Rwanda \u2014 in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,
p379
aVone that could save hundreds of millions of lives
p380
aVover the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.
p381
aVIt's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.
