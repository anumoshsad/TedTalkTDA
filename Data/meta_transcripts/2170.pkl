VMy students and I work on very tiny robots.
p4
aVNow, you can think of these as robotic versions
p5
aVof something that you're all very familiar with: an ant.
p6
aVWe all know that ants and other insects at this size scale
p7
aVcan do some pretty incredible things.
p8
aVWe've all seen a group of ants, or some version of that,
p9
aVcarting off your potato chip at a picnic, for example.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut what are the real challenges of engineering these ants?
p12
aVWell, first of all, how do we get the capabilities of an ant
p13
aVin a robot at the same size scale?
p14
aVWell, first we need to figure out how to make them move
p15
aVwhen they're so small.
p16
aVWe need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors
p17
aVin order to support that locomotion,
p18
aVand we need the sensors, power and control
p19
aVin order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot.
p20
aVAnd finally, to make these things really functional,
p21
aVwe want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I'll start with mobility.
p24
aVInsects move around amazingly well.
p25
aVThis video is from UC Berkeley.
p26
aVIt shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain
p27
aVwithout tipping over,
p28
aVand it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials,
p29
aVwhich is what we traditionally use to make robots,
p30
aVand soft materials.
p31
aVJumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small.
p32
aVSo these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly
p33
aVto get the high power they need to jump out of water, for example.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo one of the big contributions from my lab
p36
aVhas been to combine rigid and soft materials
p37
aVin very, very small mechanisms.
p38
aVSo this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side,
p39
aVso really tiny.
p40
aVThe hard material here is silicon, and the soft material is silicone rubber.
p41
aVAnd the basic idea is that we're going to compress this,
p42
aVstore energy in the springs, and then release it to jump.
p43
aVSo there's no motors on board this right now, no power.
p44
aVThis is actuated with a method that we call in my lab
p45
aV"graduate student with tweezers." (Laughter)
p46
aVSo what you'll see in the next video
p47
aVis this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps.
p48
aVSo this is Aaron, the graduate student in question, with the tweezers,
p49
aVand what you see is this  four-millimeter-sized mechanism
p50
aVjumping almost 40 centimeters high.
p51
aVThat's almost 100 times its own length.
p52
aVAnd it survives, bounces on the table,
p53
aVit's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it
p54
aVbecause it's very tiny.
p55
aa(lp56
VUltimately, though, we want to add motors to this too,
p57
aVand we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors
p58
aVto eventually integrate onto small, autonomous robots.
p59
aVBut in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start,
p60
aVwe're cheating and using magnets.
p61
aVSo this shows what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg,
p62
aVand you can see the silicone rubber joints
p63
aVand there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around
p64
aVby an external magnetic field.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier.
p67
aVThe really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out
p68
aVis how insects move at this scale.
p69
aVWe have a really good model for how everything
p70
aVfrom a cockroach up to an elephant moves.
p71
aVWe all move in this  kind of bouncy way when we run.
p72
aVBut when I'm really small,  the forces between my feet and the ground
p73
aVare going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass,
p74
aVwhich is what causes that bouncy motion.
p75
aVSo this guy doesn't work quite yet,
p76
aVbut we do have slightly larger versions that do run around.
p77
aVSo this is about a centimeter cubed, a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,
p78
aVand we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second,
p79
aVso 10 centimeters per second.
p80
aVIt's pretty quick for a little, small guy,
p81
aVand that's really only limited  by our test setup.
p82
aVBut this gives you some idea of how it works right now.
p83
aVWe can also make 3D-printed versions  of this that can climb over obstacles,
p84
aVa lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot.
p87
aVWe want sensing, power, control, actuation all together,
p88
aVand not everything needs to be bio-inspired.
p89
aVSo this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac.
p90
aVAnd in this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around,
p91
aVwe use rockets.
p92
aVSo this is a micro-fabricated energetic material,
p93
aVand we can create tiny pixels of this,
p94
aVand we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot,
p95
aVand this robot, then, is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo the next video is one of my favorites.
p98
aVSo you have this 300-milligram robot
p99
aVjumping about eight centimeters in the air.
p100
aVIt's only four by four by seven millimeters in size.
p101
aVAnd you'll see a big flash at the beginning
p102
aVwhen the energetic is set off,
p103
aVand the robot tumbling through the air.
p104
aVSo there was that big flash,
p105
aVand you can see the robot jumping up through the air.
p106
aVSo there's no tethers on this, no wires connecting to this.
p107
aVEverything is onboard, and it jumped in response
p108
aVto the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do
p111
aVwith robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale.
p112
aVImagine the rubble that you get after  a natural disaster like an earthquake.
p113
aVImagine these small robots running through that rubble
p114
aVto look for survivors.
p115
aVOr imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge
p116
aVin order to inspect it and make sure it's safe
p117
aVso you don't get collapses like this,
p118
aVwhich happened outside of  Minneapolis in 2007.
p119
aVOr just imagine what you could do
p120
aVif you had robots that could swim through your blood.
p121
aVRight? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.
p122
aVOr they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place.
p123
aVOr we could radically change the way we build things
p124
aVif we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do,
p125
aVand they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds,
p126
aVeffectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites
p127
aVin Africa and Australia.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo I think I've given you some of the possibilities
p130
aVof what we can do with these small robots.
p131
aVAnd we've made some advances so far, but there's still a long way to go,
p132
aVand hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination.
p133
