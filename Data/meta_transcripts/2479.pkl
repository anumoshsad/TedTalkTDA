VI have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible.
p4
aVI'm a copy editor.
p5
aVI work at The New Yorker,
p6
aVand copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop
p7
aVfor a Major League Baseball team:
p8
aVevery little movement gets picked over by the critics \u2014
p9
aVGod forbid you should commit an error.
p10
aa(lp11
VJust to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine.
p12
aVWe work at the level of the sentence,
p13
aVmaybe the paragraph,
p14
aVthe words, the punctuation.
p15
aVOur business is in the details.
p16
aVWe put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the "i" in "naïve."
p17
aVWe impose house style.
p18
aVEvery publication has a house style.
p19
aVThe New Yorker's is particularly distinctive.
p20
aVWe sometimes get teased for our style.
p21
aVImagine \u2014 we still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen,
p22
aVas if that word had just been coined.
p23
aVBut you see that hyphen in "teen-age"
p24
aVand that diaeresis over "coöperate,"
p25
aVand you know you're reading The New Yorker.
p26
aa(lp27
VCopyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.
p28
aVThere is a related role called query proofreading,
p29
aVor page-OK'ing.
p30
aVWhereas copyediting is mechanical,
p31
aVquery proofreading is interpretive.
p32
aVWe make suggestions to the author through the editor
p33
aVto improve the emphasis of a sentence
p34
aVor point out unintentional repetitions
p35
aVand supply compelling alternatives.
p36
aVOur purpose is to make the author look good.
p37
aa(lp38
VNote that we give our proofs not directly to the author,
p39
aVbut to the editor.
p40
aVThis often creates a good cop/bad cop dynamic
p41
aVin which the copy editor \u2014 I'll use that as an umbrella term \u2014
p42
aVis invariably the bad cop.
p43
aVIf we do our job well, we're invisible,
p44
aVbut as soon as we make a mistake,
p45
aVwe copy editors become glaringly visible.
p46
aVHere is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.
p47
aa(lp48
V[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment
p49
aVof populist no-nothingism in the Republican Party,
p50
aVendorsed Trump.]
p51
aa(lp52
V"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?" a reader wrote.
p53
aV"Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?"
p54
aa(lp55
VOuch.
p56
aVThere's no excuse for this mistake.
p57
aVBut I like it: "no-nothingism."
p58
aVIt might be American vernacular for "nihilism."
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VHere, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:
p63
aa(lp64
V[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing;
p65
aVonly her unsteady gait belied her age.]
p66
aa(lp67
VHe added:
p68
aV"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,'
p69
aVand that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence.
p70
aVCome on! Get it together."
p71
aa(lp72
VBelie: to give a false impression.
p73
aVIt should have been "betrayed."
p74
aa(lp75
VE.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker:
p76
aV"They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd it's true \u2014 we get a lot of complaints about commas.
p81
aV"Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"
p82
aVThere may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr."
p83
aVOne wag wrote:
p84
aa(lp85
V["Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain,
p86
aVthe comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"]
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VAh, well.
p91
aVIn this case, those commas are well-placed,
p92
aVexcept that there should not be one
p93
aVbetween "maniac" and "on."
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAlso, if we must have commas around "at least,"
p98
aVwe might change it up by using dashes around that phrase:
p99
aV"... \u2014 or, at least, restrain \u2014"
p100
aVPerfect.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VThen there's this:
p105
aV"Love you, love your magazine,
p106
aVbut can you please stop writing massive numbers as text?"
p107
aa(lp108
V[two and a half million ...]
p109
aa(lp110
VNo.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VOne last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:
p115
aa(lp116
V["Those long stringy things are vocal cords, not chords."]
p117
aa(lp118
VThe outraged reader added,
p119
aV"I'm sure I'm not the first to write
p120
aVregarding this egregious proofreading error,
p121
aVbut I'm equally sure I won't be the last.
p122
aVFie!"
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VI used to like getting mail.
p127
aa(lp128
VThere is a pact between writers and editors.
p129
aVThe editor never sells out the writer,
p130
aVnever goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut
p131
aVor stories that went on too long.
p132
aVA great editor saves a writer from her excesses.
p133
aVCopy editors, too, have a code;
p134
aVwe don't advertise our oversights.
p135
aVI feel disloyal divulging them here,
p136
aVso let's have look at what we do right.
p137
aa(lp138
VSomehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness.
p139
aVBut I work with writers who know how to have their way with me.
p140
aVI've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy," since the early 80s.
p141
aVAnd he's one of my favorites,
p142
aVeven though he sometimes writes a sentence
p143
aVthat gives a copy editor pause.
p144
aVHere is one from a story about Staten Island
p145
aVafter Hurricane Sandy:
p146
aa(lp147
V[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half
p148
aVsloped down toward the water,
p149
aVits support pipes and wires leaning forward
p150
aVlike when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.]
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VThis would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore.
p155
aVBut what could I do?
p156
aVTechnically, the "like" should be an "as,"
p157
aVbut it sounds ridiculous,
p158
aVas if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile \u2014
p159
aV"as when you open a box of linguine."
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VI decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy
p164
aVand let the sentence stand.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VGenerally, if I think something is wrong,
p169
aVI query it three times.
p170
aVI told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,
p171
aa(lp172
V"Only three?"
p173
aa(lp174
VSo, he has learned to hold out.
p175
aa(lp176
VRecently, he wrote a story for "Talk of the Town,"
p177
aVthat's the section at the front of the magazine
p178
aVwith short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit
p179
aVat the Metropolitan Museum
p180
aVto the introduction of doggie bags in France.
p181
aVSandy's story was about the return to the Bronx
p182
aVof Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
p183
aVThere were three things in it that I had to challenge.
p184
aa(lp185
VFirst, a grammar query.
p186
aVThe justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote,
p187
aa(lp188
V[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, unlike with the hurricane,
p191
aVwith this "like," the author didn't have the excuse
p192
aVof describing hurricane damage.
p193
aV"Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object,
p194
aVwhich is a noun.
p195
aVThis "like" had to be an "as."
p196
aV"As in an old, mostly dark painting."
p197
aa(lp198
VSecond, a spelling issue.
p199
aVThe author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:
p200
aa(lp201
V["It will be just a minute.
p202
aVWe are getting the justice mic'ed,"]
p203
aa(lp204
VMic'ed?
p205
aVThe music industry spells it "mic"
p206
aVbecause that's how it's spelled on the equipment.
p207
aVI'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling,
p208
aVand I was distraught to think that "mic'ed"
p209
aVwould get into the magazine on my watch.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VNew Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."
p214
aa(lp215
VFinally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue
p216
aVin which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number
p217
aVas its antecedent.
p218
aa(lp219
V[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]
p220
aa(lp221
V"Their" is plural and "everyone," its antecedent, is singular.
p222
aVYou would never say, "Everyone were there."
p223
aVEveryone was there. Everyone is here.
p224
aVBut people say things like, "Everyone held their breath" all the time.
p225
aVTo give it legitimacy,
p226
aVcopy editors call it "the singular 'their,'"
p227
aVas if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VIt is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it.
p232
aVI couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath,"
p233
aVor "Everyone held his breath,"
p234
aVor "Everyone held his or her breath."
p235
aVWhatever I suggested had to blend in.
p236
aVI asked, through the editor,
p237
aVif the author would consider changing it
p238
aVto "All in the vicinity held their breath,"
p239
aVbecause "all" is plural.
p240
aVNope.
p241
aa(lp242
VI tried again: "All those present held their breath?"
p243
aVI thought this sounded vaguely judicial.
p244
aVBut the editor pointed out
p245
aVthat we could not have "present" and "presence"
p246
aVin the same sentence.
p247
aVWhen the final proof came back,
p248
aVthe author had accepted "as" for "like,"
p249
aVand "miked" for "mic'ed."
p250
aVBut on "Everyone held their breath," he stood his ground.
p251
aVTwo out of three isn't bad.
p252
aa(lp253
VIn the same issue,
p254
aVin that piece on doggie bags in France,
p255
aVthere was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman.
p256
aVI wonder, when the mail comes in,
p257
aVwhich will have offended the readers more.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
