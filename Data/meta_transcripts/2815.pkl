VSo, a few years ago I heard an interesting rumor.
p4
aVApparently, the head of a large pet food company
p5
aVwould go into the annual shareholder's meeting
p6
aVwith can of dog food.
p7
aVAnd he would eat the can of dog food.
p8
aVAnd this was his way of convincing them that if it was good enough for him,
p9
aVit was good enough for their pets.
p10
aVThis strategy is now known as "dogfooding,"
p11
aVand it's a common strategy in the business world.
p12
aVIt doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food,
p13
aVbut businesspeople will use their own products
p14
aVto demonstrate that they feel \u2014
p15
aVthat they're confident in them.
p16
aVNow, this is a widespread practice,
p17
aVbut I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions
p18
aVto this rule,
p19
aVwhen you find cases of businesses or people in businesses
p20
aVwho don't use their own products.
p21
aVTurns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way,
p22
aVin a pretty regular way,
p23
aVand that is the screen-based tech industry.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, in 2010, Steve Jobs, when he was releasing the iPad,
p26
aVdescribed the iPad as a device that was "extraordinary."
p27
aV"The best browsing experience you've ever had;
p28
aVway better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone.
p29
aVIt's an incredible experience."
p30
aVA couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist
p31
aVfrom the New York Times,
p32
aVand they had a long phone call.
p33
aVAt the end of the call,
p34
aVthe journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball.
p35
aVHe said to him, "Your kids must love the iPad."
p36
aVThere's an obvious answer to this,
p37
aVbut what Jobs said really staggered the journalist.
p38
aVHe was very surprised,
p39
aVbecause he said, "They haven't used it.
p40
aVWe limit how much technology our kids use at home."
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is a very common thing in the tech world.
p43
aVIn fact, there's a school quite near Silicon Valley
p44
aVcalled the Waldorf School of the Peninsula,
p45
aVand they don't introduce screens until the eighth grade.
p46
aVWhat's really interesting about the school
p47
aVis that 75 percent of the kids who go there
p48
aVhave parents who are high-level Silicon Valley tech execs.
p49
aVSo when I heard about this, I thought it was interesting and surprising,
p50
aVand it pushed me to consider what screens were doing to me
p51
aVand to my family and the people I loved,
p52
aVand to people at large.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo for the last five years,
p55
aVas a professor of business and psychology,
p56
aVI've been studying the effect of screens on our lives.
p57
aVAnd I want to start by just focusing on how much time they take from us,
p58
aVand then we can talk about what that time looks like.
p59
aVWhat I'm showing you here is the average 24-hour workday
p60
aVat three different points in history:
p61
aV2007 \u2014 10 years ago \u2014
p62
aV2015
p63
aVand then data that I collected, actually, only last week.
p64
aVAnd a lot of things haven't changed
p65
aVall that much.
p66
aVWe sleep roughly seven-and-a-half to eight hours a day;
p67
aVsome people say that's declined slightly, but it hasn't changed much.
p68
aVWe work eight-and-a-half to nine hours a day.
p69
aVWe engage in survival activities \u2014
p70
aVthese are things like eating and bathing and looking after kids \u2014
p71
aVabout three hours a day.
p72
aa(lp73
VThat leaves this white space.
p74
aVThat's our personal time.
p75
aVThat space is incredibly important to us.
p76
aVThat's the space where we do things that make us individuals.
p77
aVThat's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships,
p78
aVwhere we really think about our lives, where we get creative,
p79
aVwhere we zoom back and try to work out
p80
aVwhether our lives have been meaningful.
p81
aVWe get some of that from work as well,
p82
aVbut when people look back on their lives
p83
aVand wonder what their lives have been like
p84
aVat the end of their lives,
p85
aVyou look at the last things they say \u2014
p86
aVthey are talking about those moments that happen in that white personal space.
p87
aVSo it's sacred; it's important to us.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, what I'm going to do is show you
p90
aVhow much of that space is taken up by screens across time.
p91
aVIn 2007,
p92
aVthis much.
p93
aVThat was the year that Apple introduced the first iPhone.
p94
aVEight years later,
p95
aVthis much.
p96
aVNow, this much.
p97
aVThat's how much time we spend of that free time in front of our screens.
p98
aVThis yellow area, this thin sliver, is where the magic happens.
p99
aVThat's where your humanity lives.
p100
aVAnd right now, it's in a very small box.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo what do we do about this?
p103
aVWell, the first question is:
p104
aVWhat does that red space look like?
p105
aVNow, of course, screens are miraculous
p106
aVin a lot of ways.
p107
aVI live in New York,
p108
aVa lot of my family lives in Australia,
p109
aVand I have a one-year-old son.
p110
aVThe way I've been able to introduce them to him is with screens.
p111
aVI couldn't have done that 15 or 20 years ago
p112
aVin quite the same way.
p113
aVSo there's a lot of good that comes from them.
p114
aa(lp115
VOne thing you can do is ask yourself:
p116
aVWhat goes on during that time?
p117
aVHow enriching are the apps that we're using?
p118
aVAnd some are enriching.
p119
aVIf you stop people while they're using them and say,
p120
aV"Tell us how you feel right now,"
p121
aVthey say they feel pretty good about these apps \u2014
p122
aVthose that focus on relaxation, exercise, weather, reading,
p123
aVeducation and health.
p124
aVThey spend an average of nine minutes a day on each of these.
p125
aVThese apps make them much less happy.
p126
aVAbout half the people, when you interrupt them and say, "How do you feel?"
p127
aVsay they don't feel good about using them.
p128
aVWhat's interesting about these \u2014
p129
aVdating, social networking, gaming,
p130
aVentertainment, news, web browsing \u2014
p131
aVpeople spend 27 minutes a day on each of these.
p132
aVWe're spending three times longer on the apps that don't make us happy.
p133
aVThat doesn't seem very wise.
p134
aa(lp135
VOne of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps
p136
aVthat make us unhappy
p137
aVis they rob us of stopping cues.
p138
aVStopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century.
p139
aVThey were baked into everything we did.
p140
aVA stopping cue is basically a signal that it's time to move on,
p141
aVto do something new, to do something different.
p142
aVAnd \u2014 think about newspapers; eventually you get to the end,
p143
aVyou fold the newspaper away, you put it aside.
p144
aVThe same with magazines, books \u2014 you get to the end of a chapter,
p145
aVprompts you to consider whether you want to continue.
p146
aVYou watched a show on TV, eventually the show would end,
p147
aVand then you'd have a week until the next one came.
p148
aVThere were stopping cues everywhere.
p149
aVBut the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues.
p150
aVThe news feed just rolls on,
p151
aVand everything's bottomless: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
p152
aVemail, text messaging, the news.
p153
aVAnd when you do check all sorts of other sources,
p154
aVyou can just keep going on and on and on.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, we can get a cue about what to do from Western Europe,
p157
aVwhere they seem to have a number of pretty good ideas in the workplace.
p158
aVHere's one example. This is a Dutch design firm.
p159
aVAnd what they've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling.
p160
aVAnd at 6pm every day,
p161
aVit doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing,
p162
aVthe desks rise to the ceiling.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VFour days a week, the space turns into a yoga studio,
p169
aVone day a week, into a dance club.
p170
aVIt's really up to you which ones you stick around for.
p171
aVBut this is a great stopping rule,
p172
aVbecause it means at the end of the day,
p173
aVeverything stops, there's no way to work.
p174
aVAt Daimler, the German car company, they've got another great strategy.
p175
aVWhen you go on vacation,
p176
aVinstead of saying, "This person's on vacation,
p177
aVthey'll get back to you eventually,"
p178
aVthey say, "This person's on vacation, so we've deleted your email.
p179
aVThis person will never see the email you just sent."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
V"You can email back in a couple of weeks,
p184
aVor you can email someone else."
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd so \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VYou can imagine what that's like.
p193
aVYou go on vacation, and you're actually on vacation.
p194
aVThe people who work at this company feel
p195
aVthat they actually get a break from work.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut of course, that doesn't tell us much
p198
aVabout what we should do at home in our own lives,
p199
aVso I want to make some suggestions.
p200
aVIt's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone.
p201
aVThe problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days.
p202
aVI think a far better strategy is to say,
p203
aVI do certain things every day,
p204
aVthere are certain occasions that happen every day,
p205
aVlike eating dinner.
p206
aVSometimes I'll be alone,
p207
aVsometimes with other people,
p208
aVsometimes in a restaurant,
p209
aVsometimes at home,
p210
aVbut the rule that I've adopted is: I will never use my phone at the table.
p211
aVIt's far away,
p212
aVas far away as possible.
p213
aVBecause we're really bad at resisting temptation.
p214
aVBut when you have a stopping cue that, every time dinner begins,
p215
aVmy phone goes far away,
p216
aVyou avoid temptation all together.
p217
aa(lp218
VAt first, it hurts.
p219
aVI had massive FOMO.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VI struggled.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut what happens is, you get used to it.
p226
aVYou overcome the withdrawal the same way you would from a drug,
p227
aVand what happens is, life becomes more colorful, richer,
p228
aVmore interesting \u2014
p229
aVyou have better conversations.
p230
aVYou really connect with the people who are there with you.
p231
aVI think it's a fantastic strategy,
p232
aVand we know it works, because when people do this \u2014
p233
aVand I've tracked a lot of people who have tried this \u2014
p234
aVit expands.
p235
aVThey feel so good about it,
p236
aVthey start doing it for the first hour of the day in the morning.
p237
aVThey start putting their phones on airplane mode on the weekend.
p238
aVThat way, your phone remains a camera, but it's no longer a phone.
p239
aVIt's a really powerful idea,
p240
aVand we know people feel much better about their lives when they do this.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo what's the take home here?
p243
aVScreens are miraculous; I've already said that,
p244
aVand I feel that it's true.
p245
aVBut the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road,
p246
aVand you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor,
p247
aVit's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal.
p248
aVYou've got a choice.
p249
aVYou can either glide by, past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes
p250
aVand take snaps out the window \u2014 that's the easy thing to do \u2014
p251
aVor you can go out of your way to move the car to the side of the road,
p252
aVto push that brake pedal,
p253
aVto get out,
p254
aVtake off your shoes and socks,
p255
aVtake a couple of steps onto the sand,
p256
aVfeel what the sand feels like under your feet,
p257
aVwalk to the ocean,
p258
aVand let the ocean lap at your ankles.
p259
aVYour life will be richer and more meaningful
p260
aVbecause you breathe in that experience,
p261
aVand because you've left your phone in the car.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you.
p264
