VSome 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.
p4
aVMy doctors told me that my lung capacity
p5
aVhad gone down to 70 percent,
p6
aVand it was killing me.
p7
aVWith the help of IIT,
p8
aVTERI, and learnings from NASA,
p9
aVwe discovered that there are three
p10
aVbasic green plants,
p11
aVcommon green plants, with which
p12
aVwe can grow all the fresh air
p13
aVwe need indoors to keep us healthy.
p14
aVWe've also found that you can
p15
aVreduce the fresh air requirements
p16
aVinto the building, while maintaining
p17
aVindustry indoor air-quality standards.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe three plants are Areca palm,
p20
aVMother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.
p21
aVThe botanical names are in front of you.
p22
aVAreca palm is a plant which
p23
aVremoves CO2 and converts it into oxygen.
p24
aVWe need four shoulder-high plants per person,
p25
aVand in terms of plant care,
p26
aVwe need to wipe the leaves
p27
aVevery day in Delhi, and perhaps
p28
aVonce a week in cleaner-air cities.
p29
aVWe had to grow them in vermi manure,
p30
aVwhich is sterile, or hydroponics,
p31
aVand take them outdoors every three to four months.
p32
aVThe second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,
p33
aVwhich is again a very common plant,
p34
aVand we call it a bedroom plant,
p35
aVbecause it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.
p36
aVAnd we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.
p37
aVThe third plant is money plant,
p38
aVand this is again a very common plant;
p39
aVpreferably grows in hydroponics.
p40
aVAnd this particular plant removes formaldehydes
p41
aVand other volatile chemicals.
p42
aa(lp43
VWith these three plants,
p44
aVyou can grow all the fresh air you need.
p45
aVIn fact, you could be in a bottle
p46
aVwith a cap on top, and you would not die at all,
p47
aVand you would not need any fresh air.
p48
aVWe have tried these plants at our
p49
aVown building in Delhi, which is a
p50
aV50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.
p51
aVAnd it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.
p52
aVOur studies have found that there is
p53
aVa 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen
p54
aVgoing up by one percent if one stays indoors
p55
aVin this building for 10 hours.
p56
aVThe government of India has discovered
p57
aVor published a study to show
p58
aVthat this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.
p59
aVAnd the study showed that,
p60
aVcompared to other buildings,
p61
aVthere is a reduced incidence of
p62
aVeye irritation by 52 percent,
p63
aVrespiratory systems by 34 percent,
p64
aVheadaches by 24 percent,
p65
aVlung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.
p66
aVAnd this study has been published on September 8, 2008,
p67
aVand it's available on the government of India website.
p68
aa(lp69
VOur experience points to an
p70
aVamazing increase in human productivity
p71
aVby over 20 percent by using these plants.
p72
aVAnd also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings
p73
aVby an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.
p74
aVWe are now replicating this in a
p75
aV1.75-million-square-feet building,
p76
aVwhich will have 60,000 indoor plants.
p77
aa(lp78
VWhy is this important?
p79
aVIt is also important for the environment,
p80
aVbecause the world's energy
p81
aVrequirements are expected to grow
p82
aVby 30 percent in the next decade.
p83
aV40 percent of the world's energy is taken
p84
aVup by buildings currently,
p85
aVand 60 percent of the world's population
p86
aVwill be living in buildings in cities
p87
aVwith a population of over one million in the next 15 years.
p88
aVAnd there is a growing preference for living
p89
aVand working in air-conditioned places.
p90
aV"Be the change you want to see in the world,"
p91
aVsaid Mahatma Gandhi.
p92
aVAnd thank you for listening.
