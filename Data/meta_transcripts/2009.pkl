VAs a little girl, I always imagined
p4
aVI would one day run away.
p5
aVFrom the age of six on,
p6
aVI kept a packed bag with some clothes
p7
aVand cans of food tucked away
p8
aVin the back of a closet.
p9
aVThere was a deep restlessness in me,
p10
aVa primal fear that I would fall prey
p11
aVto a life of routine and boredom.
p12
aVAnd so, many of my early memories involved
p13
aVintricate daydreams where I would walk across borders,
p14
aVforage for berries,
p15
aVand meet all kinds of strange people
p16
aVliving unconventional lives on the road.
p17
aa(lp18
VYears have passed, but many of the adventures
p19
aVI fantasized about as a child \u2014
p20
aVtraveling and weaving my way
p21
aVbetween worlds other than my own \u2014
p22
aVhave become realities through my work
p23
aVas a documentary photographer.
p24
aVBut no other experience has felt as true
p25
aVto my childhood dreams
p26
aVas living amongst and documenting the lives
p27
aVof fellow wanderers across the United States.
p28
aVThis is the nomadic dream,
p29
aVa different kind of American dream
p30
aVlived by young hobos, travelers,
p31
aVhitchhikers, vagrants and tramps.
p32
aa(lp33
VIn most of our minds,
p34
aVthe vagabond is a creature from the past.
p35
aVThe word "hobo" conjures up an old
p36
aVblack and white image
p37
aVof a weathered old man covered in coal,
p38
aVlegs dangling out of a boxcar,
p39
aVbut these photographs are in color,
p40
aVand they portray a community
p41
aVswirling across the country,
p42
aVfiercely alive and creatively free,
p43
aVseeing sides of America that no one else
p44
aVgets to see.
p45
aa(lp46
VLike their predecessors, today's nomads
p47
aVtravel the steel and asphalt arteries
p48
aVof the United States.
p49
aVBy day, they hop freight trains, stick out their thumbs,
p50
aVand ride the highways with anyone
p51
aVfrom truckers to soccer moms.
p52
aVBy night, they sleep beneath the stars,
p53
aVhuddled together with their packs of dogs,
p54
aVcats and pet rats between their bodies.
p55
aa(lp56
VSome travelers take to the road by choice,
p57
aVrenouncing materialism, traditional jobs
p58
aVand university degrees in exchange  for a glimmer of adventure.
p59
aVOthers come from the underbelly of society,
p60
aVnever given a chance to mobilize upwards:
p61
aVfoster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping
p62
aVabuse and unforgiving homes.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhere others see stories of privation
p65
aVand economic failure,
p66
aVtravelers view their own existence
p67
aVthrough the prism of liberation and freedom.
p68
aVThey'd rather live off of the excess
p69
aVof what they view as a wasteful consumer society
p70
aVthan slave away at an unrealistic chance
p71
aVat the traditional American dream.
p72
aVThey take advantage of the fact
p73
aVthat in the United States,
p74
aVup to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage
p75
aVby scavenging for perfectly good produce
p76
aVin dumpsters and trash cans.
p77
aVThey sacrifice material comforts in exchange
p78
aVfor the space and the time to explore
p79
aVa creative interior,
p80
aVto dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut there are many aspects to this life
p83
aVthat are far from idyllic.
p84
aVNo one loses their inner demons
p85
aVby taking to the road.
p86
aVAddiction is real, the elements are real,
p87
aVfreight trains maim and kill,
p88
aVand anyone who has lived on the streets can attest
p89
aVto the exhaustive list of laws
p90
aVthat criminalize homeless existence.
p91
aVWho here knows that in many cities
p92
aVacross the United States it is now illegal
p93
aVto sit on the sidewalk,
p94
aVto wrap oneself in a blanket,
p95
aVto sleep in your own car,
p96
aVto offer food to a stranger?
p97
aVI know about these laws because I've watched
p98
aVas friends and other travelers
p99
aVwere hauled off to jail or received citations
p100
aVfor committing these so-called crimes.
p101
aa(lp102
VMany of you might be wondering why anyone
p103
aVwould choose a life like this,
p104
aVunder the thumb of discriminatory laws,
p105
aVeating out of trash cans,
p106
aVsleeping under bridges,
p107
aVpicking up seasonal jobs here and there.
p108
aVThe answer to such a question is as varied
p109
aVas the people that take to the road,
p110
aVbut travelers often respond with a single word:
p111
aVfreedom.
p112
aVUntil we live in a society where every human
p113
aVis assured dignity in their labor
p114
aVso that they can work to live well,
p115
aVnot only work to survive,
p116
aVthere will always be an element of those
p117
aVwho seek the open road as a means of escape,
p118
aVof liberation and, of course, of rebellion.
p119
aa(lp120
VThank you.
