VHaving spent 18 years as a child of the state
p4
aVin children's homes and foster care,
p5
aVyou could say that I'm an expert on the subject,
p6
aVand in being an expert, I want to let you know that
p7
aVbeing an expert does in no way make you right
p8
aVin light of the truth.
p9
aa(lp10
VIf you're in care, legally the government is your
p11
aVparent, loco parentis.
p12
aVMargaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)
p13
aVLet's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VHarry Potter was a foster child.
p16
aVPip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;
p17
aVSuperman was a foster child;
p18
aVCinderella was a foster child;
p19
aVLisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,
p20
aVwas fostered and institutionalized;
p21
aVBatman was orphaned;
p22
aVLyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"
p23
aVwas fostered;
p24
aVJane Eyre, adopted;
p25
aVRoald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"
p26
aVMatilda; Moses \u2014 Moses! (Laughter)
p27
aVMoses! (Laughter) \u2014
p28
aVthe boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"
p29
aVAlem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"
p30
aVLuke Skywalker \u2014
p31
aVLuke Skywalker! (Laughter) \u2014
p32
aVOliver Twist;
p33
aVCassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;
p34
aVCelie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."
p35
aVAll of these great fictional characters, all of them
p36
aVwho were hurt by their condition,
p37
aVall of them who spawned thousands of other books
p38
aVand other films, all of them
p39
aVwere fostered, adopted or orphaned.
p40
aVIt seems that writers know that the child
p41
aVoutside of family reflects on what family truly is
p42
aVmore than what it promotes itself to be.
p43
aVThat is, they also use extraordinary skills
p44
aVto deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.
p45
aa(lp46
VHow have we not made the connection?
p47
aVAnd why have we not made the connection, between
p48
aV\u2014 How has that happened? \u2014
p49
aVbetween these incredible characters of popular culture
p50
aVand religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child
p51
aVin our midst? It's not our pity that they need.
p52
aVIt's our respect.
p53
aVI know famous musicians,
p54
aVI know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists
p55
aVand top lawyers and television executives
p56
aVand magazine editors and national journalists
p57
aVand dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were
p58
aVlooked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,
p59
aVand many of them grow into their adult lives
p60
aVin fear of speaking of their background, as if it may
p61
aVsomehow weaken their standing in the foreground,
p62
aVas if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb
p63
aVstrapped on the inside. Children in care,
p64
aVwho've had a life in care, deserve the right
p65
aVto own and live the memory of their own childhood.
p66
aVIt is that simple.
p67
aa(lp68
VMy own mother \u2014 and I should say this here \u2014
p69
aVshe same to this country in the late '60s,
p70
aVand she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,
p71
aVas women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?
p72
aVThey found themselves pregnant.
p73
aVAnd she sort of, she had no idea of the context
p74
aVin which she'd landed.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn the 1960s \u2014 I should give you some context \u2014 in the 1960s,
p77
aVif you were pregnant and you were single,
p78
aVyou were seen as a threat to the community.
p79
aVYou were separated from your family by the state.
p80
aVYou were separated from your family and placed into
p81
aVmother and baby homes.
p82
aVYou were appointed a social worker.
p83
aVThe adoptive parents were lined up.
p84
aVIt was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,
p85
aVto get the woman at her most vulnerable time
p86
aVin her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.
p87
aVSo the adoption papers were signed.
p88
aVThe mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.
p89
aVThe adoption papers were signed,
p90
aVthe child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother
p91
aVshipped back to her community
p92
aVto say that she'd been on a little break.
p93
aVA little break.
p94
aVA little break.
p95
aVThe first secret of shame for a woman
p96
aVfor being a woman, "a little break."
p97
aVThe adoption process took, like, a matter of months,
p98
aVso it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,
p99
aVan industrious, utilitarian solution:
p100
aVthe government, the farmer,
p101
aVthe adopting parents, the consumer,
p102
aVthe mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.
p103
aa(lp104
VIt's kind of easy to patronize the past,
p105
aVto forego our responsibilities in the present.
p106
aVWhat happened then is a direct reflection
p107
aVof what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves
p108
aVto be doing the right thing by God and by the state
p109
aVfor the big society, fast-tracking adoption.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,
p112
aVand she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating
p113
aVits own jubilee at the time
p114
aVunder the Emperor Haile Selassie,
p115
aVand she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,
p116
aVthe "Rivers of Blood" speech.
p117
aVShe lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"
p118
aVmonths before Martin Luther King was killed.
p119
aVIt was a summer of love if you were white.
p120
aVIf you were black, it was a summer of hate.
p121
aVSo she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England
p122
aVto a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.
p123
aVIt's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses \u2014
p124
aVIt's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time
p125
aVwhile she studies. But the social worker,
p126
aVhe had a different agenda.
p127
aVHe found the foster parents, and he said to them,
p128
aV"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.
p129
aVHis name is Norman." (Laughter)
p130
aVNorman! (Laughter)
p131
aVNorman!
p132
aa(lp133
VSo they took me. I was a message, they said.
p134
aVI was a sign from God, they said.
p135
aVI was Norman Mark Greenwood.
p136
aVNow, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,
p137
aVthis birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out
p138
aVfor not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman
p139
aVtoo selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years
p140
aVkneeling and praying.
p141
aVI tried praying. I swear I tried praying.
p142
aV"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"
p143
aVBut I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVAnd then I was supposed to determine whether that
p146
aVwas the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.
p147
aVAnd it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.
p148
aVWho knew? (Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VSo anyway, two years sort of passed,
p151
aVand they had a child of their own,
p152
aVand then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,
p153
aVand then another time passed
p154
aVand they had another child that they called an accident,
p155
aVwhich I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)
p156
aVAnd I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,
p157
aVso I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.
p158
aVI was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.
p159
aVNow, in their religiosity, in their naivete,
p160
aVmy mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,
p161
aVas they said they were, my mom and dad
p162
aVconceived that I had the Devil inside of me.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd what \u2014 I should say this here, because this is how
p165
aVthey engineered my leaving.
p166
aVThey sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,
p167
aV"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.
p168
aVThey've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.
p171
aa(lp172
VMy foster mother asked me to go away to think about love
p173
aVand what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow
p174
aVand give my most honest and truthful answer.
p175
aVSo this was an opportunity. If they were asking me
p176
aVwhether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,
p177
aVwhich led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.
p178
aV"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine
p179
aVthrough me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.
p180
aVThe theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,
p181
aVand the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
p182
aa(lp183
V"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."
p184
aa(lp185
V"Because you don't love us, Norman,
p186
aVclearly you've chosen your path."
p187
aa(lp188
VTwenty-four hours later, my social worker,
p189
aVthis strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,
p190
aVhe's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.
p191
aVI didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,
p192
aVmy sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,
p193
aVmy cousins, my grandparents, nobody.
p194
aVOn the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,
p195
aV"What's happened to me?"
p196
aVIt's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me
p197
aVas much as the entire floor had been taken away.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhen I got to the \u2014
p200
aVFor the next four, five years,
p201
aVI was held in four different children's homes.
p202
aVOn the third children's home, at 15,
p203
aVI started to rebel, and what I did was,
p204
aVI got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,
p205
aVand I was \u2014 it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home \u2014
p206
aVand I was in a little turret at the top of it,
p207
aVand I poured them, red, yellow and green,
p208
aVthe colors of Africa, down the tiles.
p209
aVYou couldn't see it from the street, because the home
p210
aVwas surrounded by beech trees.
p211
aa(lp212
VFor doing this, I was incarcerated for a year
p213
aVin an assessment center which was actually
p214
aVa remand center. It was a virtual prison
p215
aVfor young people.
p216
aa(lp217
VBy the way, years later, my social worker said
p218
aVthat I should never have been put in there.
p219
aVI wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.
p220
aVBut because I had no family to inquire about me,
p221
aVthey could do anything to me.
p222
aa(lp223
VI'm 17 years old, and
p224
aVthey had a padded cell.
p225
aVThey would march me down corridors in last-size order.
p226
aVThey \u2014 I was put in a dormitory
p227
aVwith a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.
p228
aVAll of the staff were ex-police \u2014 interesting \u2014
p229
aVand ex-probation officers.
p230
aVThe man who ran it was an ex-army officer.
p231
aVEvery time I had a visit by a person who I did not know
p232
aVwho would feed me grapes, once every three months,
p233
aVI was strip-searched.
p234
aVThat home was full of young boys who were on remand
p235
aVfor things like murder.
p236
aVAnd this was the preparation that I was being given
p237
aVafter 17 years as a child of the state.
p238
aa(lp239
VI have to tell this story.
p240
aVI have to tell it, because there was no one
p241
aVto put two and two together.
p242
aa(lp243
VI slowly became aware that I knew nobody
p244
aVthat knew me for longer than a year.
p245
aVSee, that's what family does.
p246
aVIt gives you reference points.
p247
aVI'm not defining a good family from a bad family.
p248
aVI'm just saying that you know when your birthday is
p249
aVby virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,
p250
aVa mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,
p251
aVa cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,
p252
aVand therefore it matters to you. Understand,
p253
aVI was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,
p254
aVand I wasn't touched either, physically touched.
p255
aa(lp256
VI'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that
p257
aVwhen I left the children's home I had two things
p258
aVthat I wanted to do. One was to find my family,
p259
aVand the other was to write poetry.
p260
aVIn creativity I saw light.
p261
aVIn the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,
p262
aVthe endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,
p263
aVthe place where anger was an expression
p264
aVin the search for love, a place where dysfunction
p265
aVis a true reaction to untruth.
p266
aa(lp267
VI've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family
p268
aVin my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,
p269
aVand I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply
p272
aVthat you can define how strong a democracy is
p273
aVby how its government treats its child.
p274
aVI don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.
p275
aVThanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)
