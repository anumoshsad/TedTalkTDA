VYou all know the truth of what I'm going to say.
p4
aVI think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive
p5
aVhas been around since before the French Revolution.
p6
aVWhat's changed
p7
aVis we now can look at the evidence,
p8
aVwe can compare societies, more and less equal societies,
p9
aVand see what inequality does.
p10
aVI'm going to take you through that data
p11
aVand then explain why
p12
aVthe links I'm going to be showing you exist.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut first, see what a miserable lot we are.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVI want to start though
p17
aVwith a paradox.
p18
aVThis shows you life expectancy
p19
aVagainst gross national income \u2014
p20
aVhow rich countries are on average.
p21
aVAnd you see the countries on the right,
p22
aVlike Norway and the USA,
p23
aVare twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.
p24
aVAnd it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.
p25
aVThere's no suggestion of a relationship there.
p26
aVBut if we look within our societies,
p27
aVthere are extraordinary social gradients in health
p28
aVrunning right across society.
p29
aVThis, again, is life expectancy.
p30
aa(lp31
VThese are small areas of England and Wales \u2014
p32
aVthe poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
p33
aVA lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.
p34
aVEven the people just below the top
p35
aVhave less good health
p36
aVthan the people at the top.
p37
aVSo income means something very important
p38
aVwithin our societies,
p39
aVand nothing between them.
p40
aVThe explanation of that paradox
p41
aVis that, within our societies,
p42
aVwe're looking at relative income
p43
aVor social position, social status \u2014
p44
aVwhere we are in relation to each other
p45
aVand the size of the gaps between us.
p46
aVAnd as soon as you've got that idea,
p47
aVyou should immediately wonder:
p48
aVwhat happens if we widen the differences,
p49
aVor compress them,
p50
aVmake the income differences bigger or smaller?
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd that's what I'm going to show you.
p53
aVI'm not using any hypothetical data.
p54
aVI'm taking data from the U.N. \u2014
p55
aVit's the same as the World Bank has \u2014
p56
aVon the scale of income differences
p57
aVin these rich developed market democracies.
p58
aVThe measure we've used,
p59
aVbecause it's easy to understand and you can download it,
p60
aVis how much richer the top 20 percent
p61
aVthan the bottom 20 percent in each country.
p62
aVAnd you see in the more equal countries on the left \u2014
p63
aVJapan, Finland, Norway, Sweden \u2014
p64
aVthe top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich
p65
aVas the bottom 20 percent.
p66
aVBut on the more unequal end \u2014
p67
aVU.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore \u2014
p68
aVthe differences are twice as big.
p69
aVOn that measure, we are twice as unequal
p70
aVas some of the other successful market democracies.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.
p73
aVWe collected data on problems with social gradients,
p74
aVthe kind of problems that are more common
p75
aVat the bottom of the social ladder.
p76
aVInternationally comparable data on life expectancy,
p77
aVon kids' maths and literacy scores,
p78
aVon infant mortality rates, homicide rates,
p79
aVproportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,
p80
aVlevels of trust,
p81
aVobesity, mental illness \u2014
p82
aVwhich in standard diagnostic classification
p83
aVincludes drug and alcohol addiction \u2014
p84
aVand social mobility.
p85
aVWe put them all in one index.
p86
aVThey're all weighted equally.
p87
aVWhere a country is is a sort of average score on these things.
p88
aVAnd there, you see it
p89
aVin relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,
p90
aVwhich I shall use over and over again in the data.
p91
aVThe more unequal countries
p92
aVare doing worse
p93
aVon all these kinds of social problems.
p94
aVIt's an extraordinarily close correlation.
p95
aVBut if you look at that same index
p96
aVof health and social problems
p97
aVin relation to GNP per capita,
p98
aVgross national income,
p99
aVthere's nothing there,
p100
aVno correlation anymore.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe were a little bit worried
p103
aVthat people might think
p104
aVwe'd been choosing problems to suit our argument
p105
aVand just manufactured this evidence,
p106
aVso we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal
p107
aVon the UNICEF index of child well-being.
p108
aVIt has 40 different components
p109
aVput together by other people.
p110
aVIt contains whether kids can talk to their parents,
p111
aVwhether they have books at home,
p112
aVwhat immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.
p113
aVEverything goes into it.
p114
aVHere it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.
p115
aVKids do worse in the more unequal societies.
p116
aVHighly significant relationship.
p117
aVBut once again,
p118
aVif you look at that measure of child well-being,
p119
aVin relation to national income per person,
p120
aVthere's no relationship,
p121
aVno suggestion of a relationship.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat all the data I've shown you so far says
p124
aVis the same thing.
p125
aVThe average well-being of our societies
p126
aVis not dependent any longer
p127
aVon national income and economic growth.
p128
aVThat's very important in poorer countries,
p129
aVbut not in the rich developed world.
p130
aVBut the differences between us
p131
aVand where we are in relation to each other
p132
aVnow matter very much.
p133
aVI'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.
p134
aVHere, for instance, is trust.
p135
aVIt's simply the proportion of the population
p136
aVwho agree most people can be trusted.
p137
aVIt comes from the World Values Survey.
p138
aVYou see, at the more unequal end,
p139
aVit's about 15 percent of the population
p140
aVwho feel they can trust others.
p141
aVBut in the more equal societies,
p142
aVit rises to 60 or 65 percent.
p143
aVAnd if you look at measures of involvement in community life
p144
aVor social capital,
p145
aVvery similar relationships
p146
aVclosely related to inequality.
p147
aa(lp148
VI may say, we did all this work twice.
p149
aVWe did it first on these rich, developed countries,
p150
aVand then as a separate test bed,
p151
aVwe repeated it all on the 50 American states \u2014
p152
aVasking just the same question:
p153
aVdo the more unequal states
p154
aVdo worse on all these kinds of measures?
p155
aVSo here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government
p156
aVrelated to inequality.
p157
aVVery similar scatter
p158
aVover a similar range of levels of trust.
p159
aVSame thing is going on.
p160
aVBasically we found
p161
aVthat almost anything that's related to trust internationally
p162
aVis related to trust amongst the 50 states
p163
aVin that separate test bed.
p164
aVWe're not just talking about a fluke.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis is mental illness.
p167
aVWHO put together figures
p168
aVusing the same diagnostic interviews
p169
aVon random samples of the population
p170
aVto allow us to compare rates of mental illness
p171
aVin each society.
p172
aVThis is the percent of the population
p173
aVwith any mental illness in the preceding year.
p174
aVAnd it goes from about eight percent
p175
aVup to three times that \u2014
p176
aVwhole societies
p177
aVwith three times the level of mental illness of others.
p178
aVAnd again, closely related to inequality.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis is violence.
p181
aVThese red dots are American states,
p182
aVand the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
p183
aVBut look at the scale of the differences.
p184
aVIt goes from 15 homicides per million
p185
aVup to 150.
p186
aVThis is the proportion of the population in prison.
p187
aVThere's a about a tenfold difference there,
p188
aVlog scale up the side.
p189
aVBut it goes from about 40 to 400
p190
aVpeople in prison.
p191
aVThat relationship
p192
aVis not mainly driven by more crime.
p193
aVIn some places, that's part of it.
p194
aVBut most of it is about more punitive sentencing,
p195
aVharsher sentencing.
p196
aVAnd the more unequal societies
p197
aVare more likely also to retain the death penalty.
p198
aVHere we have children dropping out of high school.
p199
aVAgain, quite big differences.
p200
aVExtraordinarily damaging,
p201
aVif you're talking about using the talents of the population.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is social mobility.
p204
aVIt's actually a measure of mobility
p205
aVbased on income.
p206
aVBasically, it's asking:
p207
aVdo rich fathers have rich sons
p208
aVand poor fathers have poor sons,
p209
aVor is there no relationship between the two?
p210
aVAnd at the more unequal end,
p211
aVfathers' income is much more important \u2014
p212
aVin the U.K., USA.
p213
aVAnd in Scandinavian countries,
p214
aVfathers' income is much less important.
p215
aVThere's more social mobility.
p216
aVAnd as we like to say \u2014
p217
aVand I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here \u2014
p218
aVif Americans want to live the American dream,
p219
aVthey should go to Denmark.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VI've shown you just a few things in italics here.
p226
aVI could have shown a number of other problems.
p227
aVThey're all problems that tend to be more common
p228
aVat the bottom of the social gradient.
p229
aVBut there are endless problems with social gradients
p230
aVthat are worse in more unequal countries \u2014
p231
aVnot just a little bit worse,
p232
aVbut anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.
p233
aVThink of the expense,
p234
aVthe human cost of that.
p235
aa(lp236
VI want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier
p237
aVwhere we put it all together
p238
aVto make two points.
p239
aVOne is that, in graph after graph,
p240
aVwe find the countries that do worse,
p241
aVwhatever the outcome,
p242
aVseem to be the more unequal ones,
p243
aVand the ones that do well
p244
aVseem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.
p245
aVSo what we're looking at
p246
aVis general social disfunction related to inequality.
p247
aVIt's not just one or two things that go wrong,
p248
aVit's most things.
p249
aa(lp250
VThe other really important point I want to make on this graph
p251
aVis that, if you look at the bottom,
p252
aVSweden and Japan,
p253
aVthey're very different countries in all sorts of ways.
p254
aVThe position of women,
p255
aVhow closely they keep to the nuclear family,
p256
aVare on opposite ends of the poles
p257
aVin terms of the rich developed world.
p258
aVBut another really important difference
p259
aVis how they get their greater equality.
p260
aVSweden has huge differences in earnings,
p261
aVand it narrows the gap through taxation,
p262
aVgeneral welfare state,
p263
aVgenerous benefits and so on.
p264
aVJapan is rather different though.
p265
aVIt starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.
p266
aVIt has lower taxes.
p267
aVIt has a smaller welfare state.
p268
aVAnd in our analysis of the American states,
p269
aVwe find rather the same contrast.
p270
aVThere are some states that do well through redistribution,
p271
aVsome states that do well
p272
aVbecause they have smaller income differences before tax.
p273
aVSo we conclude
p274
aVthat it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,
p275
aVas long as you get there somehow.
p276
aa(lp277
VI am not talking about perfect equality,
p278
aVI'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.
p279
aVAnother really surprising part of this picture
p280
aVis that it's not just the poor
p281
aVwho are affected by inequality.
p282
aVThere seems to be some truth in John Donne's
p283
aV"No man is an island."
p284
aVAnd in a number of studies, it's possible to compare
p285
aVhow people do in more and less equal countries
p286
aVat each level in the social hierarchy.
p287
aVThis is just one example.
p288
aVIt's infant mortality.
p289
aVSome Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths
p290
aVaccording to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.
p291
aVAnd so it's anachronistically
p292
aVa classification by fathers' occupations,
p293
aVso single parents go on their own.
p294
aVBut then where it says "low social class,"
p295
aVthat's unskilled manual occupations.
p296
aVIt goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,
p297
aVthen the junior non-manual,
p298
aVgoing up high to the professional occupations \u2014
p299
aVdoctors, lawyers,
p300
aVdirectors of larger companies.
p301
aa(lp302
VYou see there that Sweden does better than Britain
p303
aVall the way across the social hierarchy.
p304
aVThe biggest differences are at the bottom of society.
p305
aVBut even at the top,
p306
aVthere seems to be a small benefit
p307
aVto being in a more equal society.
p308
aVWe show that on about five different sets of data
p309
aVcovering educational outcomes
p310
aVand health in the United States and internationally.
p311
aVAnd that seems to be the general picture \u2014
p312
aVthat greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,
p313
aVbut has some benefits even at the top.
p314
aa(lp315
VBut I should say a few words about what's going on.
p316
aVI think I'm looking and talking
p317
aVabout the psychosocial effects of inequality.
p318
aVMore to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,
p319
aVof being valued and devalued,
p320
aVrespected and disrespected.
p321
aVAnd of course, those feelings
p322
aVof the status competition that comes out of that
p323
aVdrives the consumerism in our society.
p324
aVIt also leads to status insecurity.
p325
aVWe worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,
p326
aVwhether we're regarded as attractive, clever,
p327
aVall that kind of thing.
p328
aVThe social-evaluative judgments increase,
p329
aVthe fear of those social-evaluative judgments.
p330
aa(lp331
VInterestingly,
p332
aVsome parallel work going on in social psychology:
p333
aVsome people reviewed 208 different studies
p334
aVin which volunteers had been invited
p335
aVinto a psychological laboratory
p336
aVand had their stress hormones,
p337
aVtheir responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.
p338
aVAnd in the review,
p339
aVwhat they were interested in seeing
p340
aVis what kind of stresses
p341
aVmost reliably raise levels of cortisol,
p342
aVthe central stress hormone.
p343
aVAnd the conclusion was
p344
aVit was tasks that included social-evaluative threat \u2014
p345
aVthreats to self-esteem or social status
p346
aVin which others can negatively judge your performance.
p347
aVThose kind of stresses
p348
aVhave a very particular effect
p349
aVon the physiology of stress.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow we have been criticized.
p352
aVOf course, there are people who dislike this stuff
p353
aVand people who find it very surprising.
p354
aVI should tell you though
p355
aVthat when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,
p356
aVwe never pick and choose data.
p357
aVWe have an absolute rule
p358
aVthat if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,
p359
aVit goes into the analysis.
p360
aVOur data source decides
p361
aVwhether it's reliable data,
p362
aVwe don't.
p363
aVOtherwise that would introduce bias.
p364
aa(lp365
VWhat about other countries?
p366
aVThere are 200 studies
p367
aVof health in relation to income and equality
p368
aVin the academic peer-reviewed journals.
p369
aVThis isn't confined to these countries here,
p370
aVhiding a very simple demonstration.
p371
aVThe same countries,
p372
aVthe same measure of inequality,
p373
aVone problem after another.
p374
aVWhy don't we control for other factors?
p375
aVWell we've shown you that GNP per capita
p376
aVdoesn't make any difference.
p377
aVAnd of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature
p378
aVhave controlled for poverty and education
p379
aVand so on.
p380
aa(lp381
VWhat about causality?
p382
aVCorrelation in itself doesn't prove causality.
p383
aVWe spend a good bit of time.
p384
aVAnd indeed, people know the causal links quite well
p385
aVin some of these outcomes.
p386
aVThe big change in our understanding
p387
aVof drivers of chronic health
p388
aVin the rich developed world
p389
aVis how important chronic stress from social sources
p390
aVis affecting the immune system,
p391
aVthe cardiovascular system.
p392
aVOr for instance, the reason why violence
p393
aVbecomes more common in more unequal societies
p394
aVis because people are sensitive to being looked down on.
p395
aa(lp396
VI should say that to deal with this,
p397
aVwe've got to deal with the post-tax things
p398
aVand the pre-tax things.
p399
aVWe've got to constrain income,
p400
aVthe bonus culture incomes at the top.
p401
aVI think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees
p402
aVin any way we can.
p403
aVI think the take-home message though
p404
aVis that we can improve the real quality of human life
p405
aVby reducing the differences in incomes between us.
p406
aVSuddenly we have a handle
p407
aVon the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,
p408
aVand that's exciting.
