VI'm a painter.
p4
aVI make large-scale figurative paintings,
p5
aVwhich means I paint people
p6
aVlike this.
p7
aVBut I'm here tonight to tell you about something personal
p8
aVthat changed my work and my perspective.
p9
aVIt's something we all go through,
p10
aVand my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody.
p11
aa(lp12
VTo give you some background on me, I grew up the youngest of eight.
p13
aVYes, eight kids in my family.
p14
aVI have six older brothers and a sister.
p15
aVTo give you a sense of what that's like,
p16
aVwhen my family went on vacation,
p17
aVwe had a bus.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VMy supermom would drive us all over town
p22
aVto our various after-school activities \u2014
p23
aVnot in the bus.
p24
aVWe had a regular car, too.
p25
aVShe would take me to art classes,
p26
aVand not just one or two.
p27
aVShe took me to every available art class from when I was eight to 16,
p28
aVbecause that's all I wanted to do.
p29
aVShe even took a class with me in New York City.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, being the youngest of eight, I learned a few survival skills.
p32
aVRule number one:
p33
aVdon't let your big brother see you do anything stupid.
p34
aVSo I learned to be quiet and neat
p35
aVand careful to follow the rules and stay in line.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut painting was where I made the rules.
p38
aVThat was my private world.
p39
aVBy 14, I knew I really wanted to be an artist.
p40
aVMy big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting.
p41
aVSo I continued honing my skills.
p42
aVI went to graduate school and I got an MFA,
p43
aVand at my first solo show, my brother asked me,
p44
aV"What do all these red dots mean next to the paintings?"
p45
aVNobody was more surprised than me.
p46
aVThe red dots meant that the paintings were sold
p47
aVand that I'd be able to pay my rent
p48
aVwith painting.
p49
aVNow, my apartment had four electrical outlets,
p50
aVand I couldn't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time,
p51
aVbut still, I could pay my rent.
p52
aVSo I was very happy.
p53
aa(lp54
VHere's a painting from back around that time.
p55
aVI needed it to be as realistic as possible.
p56
aVIt had to be specific and believable.
p57
aVThis was the place where I was isolated and in total control.
p58
aa(lp59
VSince then, I've made a career of painting people in water.
p60
aVBathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment.
p61
aVIt was intimate and private,
p62
aVand water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade.
p63
aVI made about 200 of these paintings,
p64
aVsome of them six to eight feet,
p65
aVlike this one.
p66
aVFor this painting, I mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy
p67
aVand I floated cooking oil on the surface
p68
aVand stuck a girl in it,
p69
aVand when I lit it up,
p70
aVit was so beautiful I couldn't wait to paint it.
p71
aVI was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity,
p72
aValways looking for something new to add:
p73
aVvinyl, steam, glass.
p74
aVI once put all this Vaseline in my head and hair
p75
aVjust to see what that would look like.
p76
aVDon't do that.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VSo it was going well.
p81
aVI was finding my way.
p82
aVI was eager and motivated
p83
aVand surrounded by artists,
p84
aValways going to openings and events.
p85
aVI was having some success and recognition
p86
aVand I moved into an apartment with more than four outlets.
p87
aVMy mom and I would stay up very late
p88
aVtalking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other.
p89
aVShe made beautiful pottery.
p90
aa(lp91
VI have a friend named Bo who made this painting
p92
aVof his wife and I dancing by the ocean,
p93
aVand he called it "The Light Years."
p94
aVI asked him what that meant, and he said,
p95
aV"Well, that's when you've stepped into adulthood, you're no longer a child,
p96
aVbut you're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life."
p97
aVThat was it. It was the light years.
p98
aa(lp99
VOn October 8, 2011,
p100
aVthe light years came to an end.
p101
aVMy mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
p102
aVIt had spread to her bones, and it was in her brain.
p103
aVWhen she told me this, I fell to my knees.
p104
aVI totally lost it.
p105
aVAnd when I got myself together and I looked at her,
p106
aVI realized, this isn't about me.
p107
aVThis is about figuring out how to help her.
p108
aVMy father is a doctor,
p109
aVand so we had a great advantage having him in charge,
p110
aVand he did a beautiful job taking care of her.
p111
aVBut I, too, wanted to do everything I could to help,
p112
aVso I wanted to try everything.
p113
aVWe all did.
p114
aVI researched alternative medicines,
p115
aVdiets, juicing, acupuncture.
p116
aVFinally, I asked her,
p117
aV"Is this what you want me to do?"
p118
aVAnd she said, "No."
p119
aVShe said, "Pace yourself. I'm going to need you later."
p120
aa(lp121
VShe knew what was happening,
p122
aVand she knew what the doctors
p123
aVand the experts and the internet didn't know:
p124
aVhow she wanted to go through this.
p125
aVI just needed to ask her.
p126
aVI realized that if I tried to fix it,
p127
aVI would miss it.
p128
aVSo I just started to be with her,
p129
aVwhatever that meant and whatever situation came up,
p130
aVjust really listen to her.
p131
aVIf before I was resisting, then now I was surrendering,
p132
aVgiving up trying to control the uncontrollable
p133
aVand just being there in it with her.
p134
aVTime slowed down,
p135
aVand the date was irrelevant.
p136
aa(lp137
VWe developed a routine.
p138
aVEarly each morning I would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her.
p139
aVMy brother would come for breakfast
p140
aVand we'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway.
p141
aVSo I'd help her up and take both her hands
p142
aVand help her walk to the kitchen.
p143
aVShe had this huge mug she made
p144
aVshe loved to drink her coffee out of,
p145
aVand she loved Irish soda bread for breakfast.
p146
aVAfterwards was the shower,
p147
aVand she loved this part.
p148
aVShe loved the warm water,
p149
aVso I made this as indulgent as I could,
p150
aVlike a spa.
p151
aVMy sister would help sometimes.
p152
aVWe had warm towels
p153
aVand slippers ready immediately
p154
aVso she never got cold for a second.
p155
aVI'd blow-dry her hair.
p156
aVMy brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids,
p157
aVand that was the highlight of her day.
p158
aa(lp159
VOver time, we started to use a wheelchair,
p160
aVand she didn't want to eat so much,
p161
aVand she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee.
p162
aVI couldn't support her myself anymore,
p163
aVso we hired an aide to help me with the showers.
p164
aa(lp165
VThese simple daily activities
p166
aVbecame our sacred ritual,
p167
aVand we repeated them day after day
p168
aVas the cancer grew.
p169
aVIt was humbling and painful
p170
aVand exactly where I wanted to be.
p171
aVWe called this time "the beautiful awful."
p172
aa(lp173
VShe died on October 26, 2012.
p174
aVIt was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis.
p175
aVShe was gone.
p176
aVMy brothers, sister, and father and I
p177
aVall came together in this supportive and attentive way.
p178
aVIt was as though our whole family dynamic
p179
aVand all our established roles vanished
p180
aVand we were just all together in this unknown,
p181
aVfeeling the same thing
p182
aVand taking care of each other.
p183
aVI'm so grateful for them.
p184
aa(lp185
VAs someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working,
p186
aVI had no idea that this kind of connection
p187
aVcould be so important, so healing.
p188
aVThis was the most important thing.
p189
aVIt was what I always wanted.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo after the funeral, it was time for me to go back to my studio.
p192
aVSo I packed up my car and I drove back to Brooklyn,
p193
aVand painting is what I've always done, so that's what I did.
p194
aVAnd here's what happened.
p195
aVIt's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me.
p196
aVThat safe, very, very carefully rendered safe place
p197
aVthat I created in all my other paintings,
p198
aVit was a myth.
p199
aVIt didn't work.
p200
aVAnd I was afraid, because I didn't want to paint anymore.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo I went into the woods.
p203
aVI thought, I'll try that, going outside.
p204
aVI got my paints, and I wasn't a landscape painter,
p205
aVbut I wasn't really much of any kind of painter at all,
p206
aVso I had no attachment, no expectation,
p207
aVwhich allowed me to be reckless and free.
p208
aVI actually left one of these wet paintings
p209
aVoutside overnight
p210
aVnext to a light in the woods.
p211
aVBy the morning it was lacquered with bugs.
p212
aVBut I didn't care. It didn't matter. It didn't matter.
p213
aVI took all these paintings back to my studio,
p214
aVand scraped them, and carved into them,
p215
aVand poured paint thinner on them,
p216
aVput more paint on top, drew on them.
p217
aVI had no plan,
p218
aVbut I was watching what was happening.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis is the one with all the bugs in it.
p221
aVI wasn't trying to represent a real space.
p222
aVIt was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating me,
p223
aVand something started to happen.
p224
aVI got curious again.
p225
aVThis is another one from the woods.
p226
aa(lp227
VThere was a caveat now, though.
p228
aVI couldn't be controlling the paint like I used to.
p229
aVIt had to be about implying and suggesting,
p230
aVnot explaining or describing.
p231
aVAnd that imperfect, chaotic, turbulent surface
p232
aVis what told the story.
p233
aVI started to be as curious as I was when I was a student.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo the next thing was I wanted to put figures in these paintings, people,
p236
aVand I loved this new environment,
p237
aVso I wanted to have both people and this atmosphere.
p238
aVWhen the idea hit me of how to do this,
p239
aVI got kind of nauseous and dizzy,
p240
aVwhich is really just adrenaline, probably,
p241
aVbut for me it's a really good sign.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd so now I want to show you what I've been working on.
p244
aVIt's something I haven't shown yet, and it's like a preview, I guess,
p245
aVof my upcoming show,
p246
aVwhat I have so far.
p247
aVExpansive space
p248
aVinstead of the isolated bathtub.
p249
aVI'm going outside instead of inside.
p250
aVLoosening control,
p251
aVsavoring the imperfections,
p252
aVallowing the \u2014
p253
aVallowing the imperfections.
p254
aVAnd in that imperfection,
p255
aVyou can find a vulnerability.
p256
aVI could feel my deepest intention, what matters most to me,
p257
aVthat human connection
p258
aVthat can happen in a space where there's no resisting or controlling.
p259
aVI want to make paintings about that.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo here's what I learned.
p262
aVWe're all going to have big losses in our lives,
p263
aVmaybe a job or a career,
p264
aVrelationships, love, our youth.
p265
aVWe're going to lose our health,
p266
aVpeople we love.
p267
aVThese kinds of losses are out of our control.
p268
aVThey're unpredictable,
p269
aVand they bring us to our knees.
p270
aVAnd so I say, let them.
p271
aVFall to your knees. Be humbled.
p272
aVLet go of trying to change it
p273
aVor even wanting it to be different.
p274
aVIt just is.
p275
aVAnd then there's space,
p276
aVand in that space feel your vulnerability,
p277
aVwhat matters most to you,
p278
aVyour deepest intention.
p279
aVAnd be curious to connect
p280
aVto what and who is really here,
p281
aVawake and alive.
p282
aVIt's what we all want.
p283
aa(lp284
VLet's take the opportunity to find something beautiful
p285
aVin the unknown, in the unpredictable,
p286
aVand even in the awful.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
