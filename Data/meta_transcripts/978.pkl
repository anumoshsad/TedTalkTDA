VI learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.
p4
aVMy wife sent me a message,
p5
aV"Whoa, earthquake,"
p6
aVand then disappeared for 25 minutes.
p7
aVIt was 25 minutes of absolute terror
p8
aVthat thousands of people across the U.S. felt.
p9
aVI was afraid of a tsunami;
p10
aVwhat I didn't realize
p11
aVwas there was a greater terror in Haiti,
p12
aVand that was building collapse.
p13
aVWe've all seen the photos
p14
aVof the collapsed buildings in Haiti.
p15
aVThese are shots my wife took
p16
aVa couple days after the quake,
p17
aVwhile I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.
p18
aVThis is the national palace \u2014
p19
aVthe equivalent of the White House.
p20
aVThis is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean
p21
aVat peak shopping time.
p22
aVThis is a nurses' college \u2014
p23
aVthere are 300 nurses studying.
p24
aVThe general hospital right next door
p25
aVemerged largely unscathed.
p26
aVThis is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
p27
aa(lp28
VWe have all heard
p29
aVabout the tremendous human loss
p30
aVin the earthquake in Haiti,
p31
aVbut we haven't heard enough
p32
aVabout why all those lives were lost.
p33
aVWe haven't heard about
p34
aVwhy the buildings failed.
p35
aVAfter all, it was the buildings,
p36
aVnot the earthquake,
p37
aVthat killed 220,000 people,
p38
aVthat injured 330,000,
p39
aVthat displaced 1.3 million people,
p40
aVthat cut off food
p41
aVand water and supplies
p42
aVfor an entire nation.
p43
aVThis is the largest metropolitan-area disaster
p44
aVin decades,
p45
aVand it was not a natural disaster \u2014
p46
aVit was a disaster of engineering.
p47
aa(lp48
VAIDG has worked in Haiti
p49
aVsince 2007,
p50
aVproviding engineering and business support
p51
aVto small businesses.
p52
aVAnd after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers
p53
aVto figure out why the buildings collapsed,
p54
aVto examine what was safe and what wasn't.
p55
aVWorking with MINUSTAH,
p56
aVwhich is the U.N. mission in Haiti,
p57
aVwith the Ministry of Public Works,
p58
aVwith different NGOs,
p59
aVwe inspected over 1,500 buildings.
p60
aVWe inspected schools
p61
aVand private residencies.
p62
aVWe inspected medical centers
p63
aVand food warehouses.
p64
aVWe inspected government buildings.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis is the Ministry of Justice.
p67
aVBehind that door
p68
aVis the National Judicial Archives.
p69
aVThe fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault \u2014
p70
aVwho's the director
p71
aVof the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research
p72
aVat the University of Buffalo \u2014
p73
aVwas examining it to see if it was safe
p74
aVto recover the archives.
p75
aVAndre told me,
p76
aVafter seeing these buildings fail
p77
aVagain and again in the same way,
p78
aVthat there is no new research here.
p79
aVThere is nothing here that we don't know.
p80
aVThe failure points were the same:
p81
aVwalls and slabs not tied properly into columns \u2014
p82
aVthat's a roof slab hanging off the building \u2014
p83
aVcantilevered structures,
p84
aVor structures that were asymmetric,
p85
aVthat shook violently and came down,
p86
aVpoor building materials,
p87
aVnot enough concrete,
p88
aVnot enough compression in the blocks,
p89
aVrebar that was smooth,
p90
aVrebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow there's a solution
p93
aVto all these problems.
p94
aVAnd we know how to build properly.
p95
aVThe proof of this came in Chile,
p96
aValmost a month later,
p97
aVwhen 8.8 magnitude earthquake
p98
aVhit Chile.
p99
aVThat is 500 times
p100
aVthe power of the 7.0
p101
aVthat hit Port-au-Prince \u2014
p102
aV500 times the power,
p103
aVyet only under a thousand casualties.
p104
aVAdjusted for population density,
p105
aVthat is less than one percent
p106
aVof the impact of the Haitian quake.
p107
aVWhat was the difference
p108
aVbetween Chile and Haiti?
p109
aVSeismic standards
p110
aVand confined masonry,
p111
aVwhere the building acts as a whole \u2014
p112
aVwalls and columns
p113
aVand roofs and slabs
p114
aVtied together to support each other \u2014
p115
aVinstead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
p116
aVIf you look at this building in Chile,
p117
aVit's ripped in half,
p118
aVbut it's not a pile of rubble.
p119
aVChileans have been building with confined masonry
p120
aVfor decades.
p121
aa(lp122
VRight now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,
p123
aVArchitecture for Humanity,
p124
aVto bring more confined masonry training
p125
aVinto Haiti.
p126
aVThis is Xantus Daniel;
p127
aVhe's a mason,
p128
aVjust a general construction worker, not a foreman,
p129
aVwho took one of our trainings.
p130
aVOn his last job he was working with his boss,
p131
aVand they started pouring the columns wrong.
p132
aVHe took his boss aside,
p133
aVand he showed him the materials on confined masonry.
p134
aVHe showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.
p135
aVIt won't cost us any more
p136
aVto do it the right way."
p137
aVAnd they redid that building.
p138
aVThey tied the rebar right,
p139
aVthey poured the columns right,
p140
aVand that building will be safe.
p141
aVAnd every building
p142
aVthat they build going forward
p143
aVwill be safe.
p144
aa(lp145
VTo make sure these buildings are safe,
p146
aVit's not going to take policy \u2014
p147
aVit's going to take reaching out
p148
aVto the masons on the ground
p149
aVand helping them learn the proper techniques.
p150
aVNow there are many groups doing this.
p151
aVAnd the fellow in the vest there,
p152
aVCraig Toten,
p153
aVhe has pushed forward
p154
aVto get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.
p155
aVThrough Haiti Rewired,
p156
aVthrough Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,
p157
aVAIDG,
p158
aVthere is the possibility
p159
aVto reach out
p160
aVto 30,000 \u2014 40,000 masons
p161
aVacross the country
p162
aVand create a movement of proper building.
p163
aVIf you reach out to the people on the ground
p164
aVin this collaborative way
p165
aVit's extremely affordable.
p166
aVFor the billions spent on reconstruction,
p167
aVyou can train masons
p168
aVfor dollars on every house
p169
aVthat they end up building over their lifetime.
p170
aa(lp171
VUltimately, there are two ways
p172
aVthat you can rebuild Haiti;
p173
aVthe way at the top
p174
aVis the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
p175
aVThe way at the top
p176
aVis a poorly constructed building
p177
aVthat will fail.
p178
aVThe way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,
p179
aVwhere the walls are tied together,
p180
aVthe building is symmetric,
p181
aVand it will stand up to an earthquake.
p182
aVFor all the disaster,
p183
aVthere is an opportunity here
p184
aVto build better houses
p185
aVfor the next generation,
p186
aVso that when the next earthquake hits,
p187
aVit is a disaster \u2014
p188
aVbut not a tragedy.
