VI haven't told many people this,
p4
aVbut in my head, I've got
p5
aVthousands of secret worlds all going on
p6
aVall at the same time.
p7
aVI am also autistic.
p8
aa(lp9
VPeople tend to diagnose autism
p10
aVwith really specific  check-box descriptions,
p11
aVbut in reality, it's a whole variation as to what we're like.
p12
aVFor instance, my little brother,
p13
aVhe's very severely autistic.
p14
aVHe's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.
p15
aVBut I love to talk.
p16
aVPeople often associate autism
p17
aVwith liking maths and  science and nothing else,
p18
aVbut I know so many autistic people
p19
aVwho love being creative.
p20
aVBut that is a stereotype,
p21
aVand the stereotypes of things
p22
aVare often, if not always, wrong.
p23
aVFor instance, a lot of people
p24
aVthink autism and think  "Rain Man" immediately.
p25
aVThat's the common belief,
p26
aVthat every single autistic  person is Dustin Hoffman,
p27
aVand that's not true.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut that's not just with  autistic people, either.
p30
aVI've seen it with LGBTQ people,
p31
aVwith women, with POC people.
p32
aVPeople are so afraid of variety
p33
aVthat they try to fit everything  into a tiny little box
p34
aVwith really specific labels.
p35
aVThis is something that actually
p36
aVhappened to me in real life:
p37
aVI googled "autistic people are ..."
p38
aVand it comes up with suggestions
p39
aVas to what you're going to type.
p40
aVI googled "autistic people are ..."
p41
aVand the top result was "demons."
p42
aVThat is the first thing that people think
p43
aVwhen they think autism.
p44
aVThey know.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VOne of the things I can do  because I'm autistic \u2014
p48
aVit's an ability rather than a disability \u2014
p49
aVis I've got a very, very vivid imagination.
p50
aVLet me explain it to you a bit.
p51
aVIt's like I'm walking in two  worlds most of the time.
p52
aVThere's the real world,  the world that we all share,
p53
aVand there's the world in my mind,
p54
aVand the world in my mind  is often so much more real
p55
aVthan the real world.
p56
aVLike, it's very easy for  me to let my mind loose
p57
aVbecause I don't try and fit  myself into a tiny little box.
p58
aVThat's one of the best  things about being autistic.
p59
aVYou don't have the urge to do that.
p60
aVYou find what you want to do,
p61
aVyou find a way to do it,  and you get on with it.
p62
aVIf I was trying to fit myself into a box,
p63
aVI wouldn't be here, I  wouldn't have achieved
p64
aVhalf the things that I have now.
p65
aVThere are problems, though.
p66
aVThere are problems with being autistic,
p67
aVand there are problems with having too much imagination.
p68
aVSchool can be a problem in general,
p69
aVbut having also to explain to a teacher
p70
aVon a daily basis
p71
aVthat their lesson is inexplicably dull
p72
aVand you are secretly taking refuge
p73
aVin a world inside your head in  which you are not in that lesson,
p74
aVthat adds to your list of problems.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVAlso, when my imagination takes hold,
p77
aVmy body takes on a life of its own.
p78
aVWhen something very exciting happens in my inner world,
p79
aVI've just got to run.
p80
aVI've got to rock backwards and forwards,
p81
aVor sometimes scream.
p82
aVThis gives me so much energy,
p83
aVand I've got to have an  outlet for all that energy.
p84
aVBut I've done that ever  since I was a child,
p85
aVever since I was a tiny little girl.
p86
aVAnd my parents thought it was  cute, so they didn't bring it up,
p87
aVbut when I got into school,
p88
aVthey didn't really agree that it was cute.
p89
aVIt can be that people  don't want to be friends
p90
aVwith the girl that starts  screaming in an algebra lesson.
p91
aVAnd this doesn't normally  happen in this day and age,
p92
aVbut it can be that people don't want  to be friends with the autistic girl.
p93
aVIt can be that people  don't want to associate
p94
aVwith anyone who won't  or can't fit themselves
p95
aVinto a box that's labeled normal.
p96
aVBut that's fine with me,
p97
aVbecause it sorts the wheat from the chaff,
p98
aVand I can find which people  are genuine and true
p99
aVand I can pick these people as my friends.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut if you think about it, what is normal?
p102
aVWhat does it mean?
p103
aVImagine if that was the best  compliment you ever received.
p104
aV"Wow, you are really normal."
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVBut compliments are,
p107
aV"you are extraordinary"
p108
aVor "you step outside the box."
p109
aVIt's "you're amazing."
p110
aVSo if people want to be these things,
p111
aVwhy are so many people  striving to be normal?
p112
aVWhy are people pouring their  brilliant individual light into a mold?
p113
aVPeople are so afraid of variety  that they try and force everyone,
p114
aVeven people who don't want  to or can't, to become normal.
p115
aVThere are camps for LGBTQ people
p116
aVor autistic people to try and  make them this "normal,"
p117
aVand that's terrifying that people  would do that in this day and age.
p118
aa(lp119
VAll in all, I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world.
p120
aVBecause I am autistic,
p121
aVI've presented documentaries to the BBC,
p122
aVI'm in the midst of writing a book,
p123
aVI'm doing this \u2014 this is fantastic \u2014
p124
aVand one of the best  things that I've achieved,
p125
aVthat I consider to have achieved,
p126
aVis I've found ways of communicating
p127
aVwith my little brother and sister,
p128
aVwho as I've said are nonverbal.  They can't speak.
p129
aVAnd people would often write off someone who's nonverbal,
p130
aVbut that's silly, because  my little brother and sister
p131
aVare the best siblings that  you could ever hope for.
p132
aVThey're just the best,  and I love them so much
p133
aVand I care about them  more than anything else.
p134
aVI'm going to leave you with one question:
p135
aVIf we can't get inside the person's minds,
p136
aVno matter if they're autistic or not,
p137
aVinstead of punishing anything that strays from normal,
p138
aVwhy not celebrate uniqueness
p139
aVand cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination?
p140
aa(lp141
