VPhotography has been my passion
p4
aVever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,
p5
aVbut today I want to share with you
p6
aVthe 15 most treasured photos of mine,
p7
aVand I didn't take any of them.
p8
aVThere were no art directors, no stylists,
p9
aVno chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.
p10
aVIn fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.
p11
aa(lp12
VMy story begins
p13
aVwhen I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,
p14
aVand my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter
p15
aVon her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.
p16
aVWe happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,
p17
aVso we decided to take the same picture.
p18
aa(lp19
VWell you can see where this is going.
p20
aVApproaching my daughter's third birthday,
p21
aVmy wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York
p22
aVand make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"
p23
aVThis is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.
p24
aa(lp25
VYou know, it's remarkable how universal
p26
aVthe gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.
p27
aVNo one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.
p28
aa(lp29
VBack then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.
p30
aVIt's really become sacred to us.
p31
aVThis one was taken just weeks after 9/11,
p32
aVand I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day
p33
aVin ways a five-year-old could understand.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo these photos are far more than proxies
p36
aVfor a single moment, or even a specific trip.
p37
aVThey're also ways for us to freeze time
p38
aVfor one week in October
p39
aVand reflect on our times
p40
aVand how we change from year to year,
p41
aVand not just physically, but in every way.
p42
aVBecause while we take the same photo,
p43
aVour perspectives change,
p44
aVand she reaches new milestones,
p45
aVand I get to see life through her eyes,
p46
aVand how she interacts with and sees everything.
p47
aVThis very focused time we get to spend together
p48
aVis something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.
p49
aa(lp50
VRecently, on one trip, we were walking,
p51
aVand she stops dead in her tracks,
p52
aVand she points to a red awning of the doll store
p53
aVthat she loved when she was little
p54
aVon our earlier trips.
p55
aVAnd she describes to me the feeling she felt
p56
aVas a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.
p57
aVShe said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest
p58
aVwhen she saw that place for the very first time
p59
aVnine years earlier.
p60
aVAnd now what she's looking at in New York
p61
aVare colleges,
p62
aVbecause she's determined to go to school in New York.
p63
aVAnd it hit me: One of the most important things
p64
aVwe all make are memories.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I want to share the idea of taking an active role
p67
aVin consciously creating memories.
p68
aVI don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,
p69
aVI'm not in many of the family photos.
p70
aVI'm always the one taking the picture.
p71
aVSo I want to encourage everyone today
p72
aVto get in the shot,
p73
aVand don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,
p74
aV"Will you take our picture?"
p75
aVThank you. (Applause)
