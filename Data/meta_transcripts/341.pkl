VSuppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.
p4
aVThey go to see Michelangelo's "David,"
p5
aVand when they finally come face to face with the statue,
p6
aVthey both freeze dead in their tracks.
p7
aVThe first guy \u2014 we'll call him Adam \u2014
p8
aVis transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.
p9
aVThe second guy \u2014 we'll call him Bill \u2014
p10
aVis transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.
p11
aVSo here's my question for you:
p12
aVwhich one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,
p13
aVwhich for Al Gore?
p14
aa(lp15
VI don't need a show of hands
p16
aVbecause we all have the same political stereotypes.
p17
aVWe all know that it's Bill.
p18
aVAnd in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.
p19
aVIt really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives
p20
aVon a major personality trait called openness to experience.
p21
aVPeople who are high in openness to experience
p22
aVjust crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.
p23
aVPeople low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.
p24
aa(lp25
VIf you know about this trait,
p26
aVyou can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.
p27
aVYou can understand why artists are so different from accountants.
p28
aVYou can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read,
p29
aVwhat kinds of places they like to travel to,
p30
aVand what kinds of food they like to eat.
p31
aVOnce you understand this trait, you can understand
p32
aVwhy anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVThis trait also tells us a lot about politics.
p35
aVThe main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that,
p36
aV"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views" \u2014
p37
aVthey like a society which is open and changing \u2014
p38
aV"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views."
p39
aa(lp40
VThis trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.
p41
aVSo here's the description of a group I found on the Web.
p42
aVWhat kinds of people would join a global community
p43
aVwelcoming people from every discipline and culture,
p44
aVwho seek a deeper understanding of the world,
p45
aVand who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?
p46
aVThis is from some guy named Ted.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVWell, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal,
p49
aVand openness predicts who becomes a TEDster,
p50
aVthen might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal?
p51
aVLet's find out.
p52
aVI'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center \u2014
p53
aVon social issues, we're talking about, primarily \u2014
p54
aVor conservative, and I'll give a third option,
p55
aVbecause I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience.
p56
aVSo, right now, please raise your hand \u2014
p57
aVdown in the simulcast rooms, too,
p58
aVlet's let everybody see who's here \u2014
p59
aVplease raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center.
p60
aVPlease raise your hand high right now. OK.
p61
aVPlease raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.
p62
aVOK, about a \u2014 two dozen.
p63
aVAnd please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.
p64
aVOne, two, three, four, five \u2014 about eight or 10.
p65
aa(lp66
VOK. This is a bit of a problem.
p67
aVBecause if our goal is to understand the world,
p68
aVto seek a deeper understanding of the world,
p69
aVour general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
p70
aVBecause when people all share values, when people all share morals,
p71
aVthey become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,
p72
aVit shuts down open-minded thinking.
p73
aVWhen the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,
p74
aVand as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVWe try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.
p77
aVWe think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aV(Applause)
p80
aVSo, if you think that half of America votes Republican
p81
aVbecause they are blinded in this way,
p82
aVthen my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,
p83
aVin a particular moral matrix.
p84
aVAnd by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."
p85
aa(lp86
VBut I'm here today to give you a choice.
p87
aVYou can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,
p88
aVor you can take the red pill,
p89
aVlearn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.
p90
aVNow, because I know \u2014
p91
aV(Applause) \u2014
p92
aVOK, I assume that answers my question.
p93
aVI was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.
p94
aVYou're all high in openness to experience, and besides,
p95
aVit looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.
p96
aVSo anyway, let's go with the red pill.
p97
aVLet's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.
p98
aa(lp99
VLet's start at the beginning.
p100
aVWhat is morality and where does it come from?
p101
aVThe worst idea in all of psychology
p102
aVis the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.
p103
aVDevelopmental psychology has shown
p104
aVthat kids come into the world already knowing so much
p105
aVabout the physical and social worlds,
p106
aVand programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things
p107
aVand hard to learn others.
p108
aVThe best definition of innateness I've ever seen \u2014
p109
aVthis just clarifies so many things for me \u2014
p110
aVis from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.
p111
aVHe says, "The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.
p112
aVNature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.
p113
aVBuilt-in doesn't mean unmalleable;
p114
aVit means organized in advance of experience."
p115
aVOK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?
p116
aVTo find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I
p117
aVread through the literature on anthropology,
p118
aVon culture variation in morality
p119
aVand also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.
p120
aVWhat are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?
p121
aVThat you find across cultures and even across species?
p122
aVWe found five \u2014 five best matches,
p123
aVwhich we call the five foundations of morality.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe first one is harm/care.
p126
aVWe're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming
p127
aVthat makes us really bond with others, care for others,
p128
aVfeel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.
p129
aVIt gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.
p130
aVThis moral foundation underlies about 70 percent
p131
aVof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.
p134
aVThere's actually ambiguous evidence
p135
aVas to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,
p136
aVbut the evidence for people could not be clearer.
p137
aVThis Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule,"
p138
aVand we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,
p139
aVas the foundation of so many religions.
p140
aVThat second foundation underlies the other 30 percent
p141
aVof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe third foundation is in-group/loyalty.
p144
aVYou do find groups in the animal kingdom \u2014
p145
aVyou do find cooperative groups \u2014
p146
aVbut these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.
p147
aVIt's only among humans that you find very large groups of people
p148
aVwho are able to cooperate, join together into groups,
p149
aVbut in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.
p150
aVThis probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.
p151
aVAnd this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable
p152
aVthat even when we don't have tribes,
p153
aVwe go ahead and make them, because it's fun.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVSports is to war as pornography is to sex.
p156
aVWe get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe fourth foundation is authority/respect.
p159
aVHere you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.
p160
aVBut authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,
p161
aVas it is in other primates.
p162
aVIt's based on more voluntary deference,
p163
aVand even elements of love, at times.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.
p166
aVThis painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,"
p167
aVbut purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.
p168
aVIt's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea
p169
aVthat tells you that you can attain virtue
p170
aVby controlling what you do with your body,
p171
aVby controlling what you put into your body.
p172
aVAnd while the political right may moralize sex much more,
p173
aVthe political left is really doing a lot of it with food.
p174
aVFood is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,
p175
aVand a lot of it is ideas about purity,
p176
aVabout what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.
p177
aa(lp178
VI believe these are the five best candidates
p179
aVfor what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.
p180
aVI think this is what we come with, at least
p181
aVa preparedness to learn all of these things.
p182
aVBut as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,
p183
aVhow is this first draft going to get revised?
p184
aVAnd how will it end up being different
p185
aVfrom a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?
p186
aVTo think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.
p187
aVIf there really are five systems at work in the mind \u2014
p188
aVfive sources of intuitions and emotions \u2014
p189
aVthen we can think of the moral mind
p190
aVas being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,
p191
aVwhere you can set it to a different setting on every channel.
p192
aVAnd my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,
p193
aVmade a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.
p194
aVAnd so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.
p195
aVHere are the results.
p196
aVHere are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.
p197
aVOn the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;
p198
aVon the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.
p199
aVThe blue line shows you people's responses
p200
aVon the average of all the harm questions.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.
p203
aVThey give high endorsement of these sorts of statements
p204
aVall across the board, but as you also see,
p205
aVliberals care about it a little more than conservatives \u2014 the line slopes down.
p206
aVSame story for fairness.
p207
aVBut look at the other three lines.
p208
aVFor liberals, the scores are very low.
p209
aVLiberals are basically saying, "No, this is not morality.
p210
aVIn-group, authority, purity \u2014 this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it."
p211
aVBut as people get more conservative, the values rise.
p212
aVWe can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,
p213
aVor two-foundation morality.
p214
aVConservatives have more of a five-foundation,
p215
aVor five-channel morality.
p216
aa(lp217
VWe find this in every country we look at.
p218
aVHere's the data for 1,100 Canadians.
p219
aVI'll just flip through a few other slides.
p220
aVThe U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,
p221
aVLatin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.
p222
aVNotice also that on all of these graphs,
p223
aVthe slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.
p224
aVWhich shows that within any country,
p225
aVthe disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.
p226
aVEverybody \u2014 I mean, we debate over what's fair \u2014
p227
aVbut everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.
p228
aVMoral arguments within cultures
p229
aVare especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.
p232
aVIn one recent study,
p233
aVwe asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.
p234
aVYou picked a particular breed,
p235
aVyou learned some new information about the breed.
p236
aVSuppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,
p237
aVand relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?
p238
aVWell, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!"
p239
aVBecause liberals like to say, "Fetch, please."
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVBut if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.
p242
aVIf you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal
p243
aVto its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,
p244
aVfor conservatives, well, loyalty is good \u2014 dogs ought to be loyal.
p245
aVBut to a liberal, it sounds like this dog
p246
aVis running for the Republican nomination.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, you might say, OK,
p250
aVthere are these differences between liberals and conservatives,
p251
aVbut what makes those three other foundations moral?
p252
aVAren't those just the foundations of xenophobia
p253
aVand authoritarianism and Puritanism?
p254
aVWhat makes them moral?
p255
aVThe answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,
p256
aV"The Garden of Earthly Delights."
p257
aVIn the first panel, we see the moment of creation.
p258
aVAll is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals
p259
aVare doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.
p260
aVBut then, given the way of the world, things change.
p261
aVWe get every person doing whatever he wants,
p262
aVwith every aperture of every other person and every other animal.
p263
aVSome of you might recognize this as the '60s.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVBut the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,
p266
aVwhere the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.
p267
aVOf course, Bosch called this hell.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo this triptych, these three panels
p270
aVportray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.
p271
aVThe truth of social entropy.
p272
aVBut lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination
p273
aVwhere Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,
p274
aVhere's the same story, the same progression,
p275
aVtold in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,
p276
aVin which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.
p277
aVA game in which you give people money,
p278
aVand then, on each round of the game,
p279
aVthey can put money into a common pot,
p280
aVand then the experimenter doubles what's in there,
p281
aVand then it's all divided among the players.
p282
aVSo it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,
p283
aVwhere we're asking people to make a sacrifice
p284
aVand they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.
p285
aVBut you really want everybody else to sacrifice,
p286
aVbut everybody has a temptation to a free ride.
p287
aVAnd what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative \u2014
p288
aVand this is all played anonymously.
p289
aVOn the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.
p290
aVBut they quickly see, "You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.
p291
aVI don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate."
p292
aVAnd so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut then \u2014 and here's the trick \u2014
p295
aVFehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,
p296
aV"You know what? New rule.
p297
aVIf you want to give some of your own money
p298
aVto punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that."
p299
aVAnd as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,
p300
aVcooperation shoots up.
p301
aVIt shoots up and it keeps going up.
p302
aVThere's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.
p303
aVIt's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.
p304
aVIt really helps to have some sort of punishment.
p305
aVEven if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,
p306
aVyou need some sort of punishment to bring people,
p307
aVwhen they're in large groups, to cooperate.
p308
aVThere's even some recent research suggesting that religion \u2014
p309
aVpriming God, making people think about God \u2014
p310
aVoften, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.
p311
aa(lp312
VSome people think that religion is an adaptation
p313
aVevolved both by cultural and biological evolution
p314
aVto make groups to cohere,
p315
aVin part for the purpose of trusting each other,
p316
aVand then being more effective at competing with other groups.
p317
aVI think that's probably right,
p318
aValthough this is a controversial issue.
p319
aVBut I'm particularly interested in religion,
p320
aVand the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.
p321
aVBecause I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.
p322
aVThe Grand Canyon is really simple.
p323
aVIt's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,
p324
aVand you get the Grand Canyon.
p325
aVIt's not that complicated.
p326
aVThis is what's really complicated,
p327
aVthat there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,
p328
aVcooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,
p329
aVor on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages
p330
aVgrew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.
p331
aVHow did this happen?
p332
aVThis is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.
p333
aa(lp334
VThe answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.
p335
aVIt took all of our moral psychology
p336
aVto create these cooperative groups.
p337
aVYes, you do need to be concerned about harm,
p338
aVyou do need a psychology of justice.
p339
aVBut it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,
p340
aVand if those sub-groups have some internal structure,
p341
aVand if you have some ideology that tells people
p342
aVto suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.
p343
aVAnd now we get to the crux of the disagreement
p344
aVbetween liberals and conservatives.
p345
aVBecause liberals reject three of these foundations.
p346
aVThey say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership."
p347
aVThey say, "Let's question authority."
p348
aVAnd they say, "Keep your laws off my body."
p349
aa(lp350
VLiberals have very noble motives for doing this.
p351
aVTraditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,
p352
aVand restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.
p353
aVSo liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
p354
aVThey want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.
p355
aVThis guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."
p356
aVIf you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,
p357
aVit's change, it's fun.
p358
aVConservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.
p359
aVThey want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.
p360
aVThe great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.
p361
aVIt's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.
p362
aVSo as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,
p363
aVas well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."
p364
aVThis was after the chaos of the French Revolution.
p365
aVSo once you see this \u2014 once you see
p366
aVthat liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,
p367
aVthat they form a balance on change versus stability \u2014
p368
aVthen I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.
p369
aa(lp370
VThis is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.
p371
aVThink about yin and yang.
p372
aVYin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.
p373
aVYin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,
p374
aVfor the functioning of the world.
p375
aVYou find the same thing in Hinduism.
p376
aVThere are many high gods in Hinduism.
p377
aVTwo of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.
p378
aVThis image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.
p379
aVYou have the markings of Vishnu on the left,
p380
aVso we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.
p381
aVYou have the markings of Shiva on the right,
p382
aVShiva's the liberal god. And they work together.
p383
aVYou find the same thing in Buddhism.
p384
aVThese two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights
p385
aVthat have ever been attained into moral psychology.
p386
aVFrom the Zen master Seng-ts'an:
p387
aV"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.
p388
aVThe struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease."
p389
aVNow unfortunately, it's a disease
p390
aVthat has been caught by many of the world's leaders.
p391
aVBut before you feel superior to George Bush,
p392
aVbefore you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?
p393
aVDo you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?
p394
aVCan you be not for or against anything?
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, what's the point? What should you do?
p397
aVWell, if you take the greatest insights
p398
aVfrom ancient Asian philosophies and religions,
p399
aVand you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,
p400
aVI think you come to these conclusions:
p401
aVthat our righteous minds were designed by evolution
p402
aVto unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams
p403
aVand then to blind us to the truth.
p404
aVSo what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?
p405
aVAm I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,
p406
aVstop with this struggle of for and against?
p407
aVNo, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.
p408
aVThis is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,
p409
aVusing so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,
p410
aVto make the world a better place, to fight \u2014
p411
aVto fight wrongs, to solve problems.
p412
aa(lp413
VBut as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story
p414
aVabout Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,
p415
aVsaying, "You're wrong, and I'm right."
p416
aVBecause, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.
p417
aVA lot of the problems we have to solve
p418
aVare problems that require us to change other people.
p419
aVAnd if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it
p420
aVis to first understand who we are \u2014 understand our moral psychology,
p421
aVunderstand that we all think we're right \u2014 and then step out,
p422
aVeven if it's just for a moment, step out \u2014 check in with Seng-ts'an.
p423
aVStep out of the moral matrix,
p424
aVjust try to see it as a struggle playing out,
p425
aVin which everybody does think they're right,
p426
aVand everybody, at least, has some reasons \u2014 even if you disagree with them \u2014
p427
aVeverybody has some reasons for what they're doing.
p428
aVStep out.
p429
aVAnd if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,
p430
aVto get yourself out of this self-righteousness,
p431
aVwhich is the normal human condition.
p432
aVThink about the Dalai Lama.
p433
aVThink about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama \u2014
p434
aVand it comes from his moral humility.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo I think the point \u2014 the point of my talk,
p437
aVand I think the point of TED \u2014
p438
aVis that this is a group that is passionately engaged
p439
aVin the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
p440
aVPeople here are passionately engaged
p441
aVin trying to make the world a better place.
p442
aVBut there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.
p443
aVAnd so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment
p444
aVto the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.
p445
aVThank you.
