VMy search is always to find ways to chronicle,
p4
aVto share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.
p5
aVStories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,
p6
aVbut that are never sentimental,
p7
aVthat never look away from the darkest things about us.
p8
aVBecause I really believe that we're never more beautiful
p9
aVthan when we're most ugly.
p10
aVBecause that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.
p11
aVAs Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria
p12
aVwith a whole generation \u2014 in the '80s \u2014
p13
aVof students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.
p14
aVSo it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut what I've come to learn
p17
aVis that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,
p18
aVbut in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,
p19
aVeveryday acts of compassion.
p20
aVIn South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.
p21
aVUbuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,
p22
aVthe only way for me to be human is for you to reflect
p23
aVmy humanity back at me.
p24
aVBut if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
p25
aVI don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it
p26
aVuntil there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
p27
aVThen suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.
p28
aVIt's usually when I'm cussing in traffic
p29
aVat someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee
p30
aVand send emails and make notes.
p31
aVSo what Ubuntu really says
p32
aVis that there is no way for us to be human without other people.
p33
aVIt's really very simple, but really very complicated.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, I thought I should start with some stories.
p36
aVI should tell you some stories about remarkable people,
p37
aVso I thought I'd start with my mother.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVAnd she was dark, too.
p40
aVMy mother was English.
p41
aVMy parents met in Oxford in the '50s,
p42
aVand my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.
p43
aVShe was five foot two, very feisty and very English.
p44
aVThis is how English my mother is \u2014 or was, she just passed.
p45
aVShe came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,
p46
aVand we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVAnd then we went to a fish restaurant,
p49
aVand we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,
p50
aVand he came up and my mother said,
p51
aV"Do you have any specials, young man?"
p52
aVAnd Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,
p53
aVthat's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.
p54
aVIt's totally rad."
p55
aVAnd my mother turned to me and said,
p56
aV"What language is he speaking?"
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVI said, "English, mum."
p59
aVAnd she shook her head and said,
p60
aV"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,
p61
aVwhy don't they use it?"
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, this woman, who converted from the Church of England
p65
aVto Catholicism when she married my father \u2014
p66
aVand there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert \u2014
p67
aVdecided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,
p68
aVparticularly among Igbo women,
p69
aVthe Billings ovulation method,
p70
aVwhich was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.
p71
aVBut her Igbo wasn't too good.
p72
aVSo she took me along to translate.
p73
aVI was seven.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVSo, here are these women,
p76
aVwho never discuss their period with their husbands,
p77
aVand here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVAnd, "Do you notice any discharges?"
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVAnd, "How swollen is your vulva?"
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVShe never would have thought of herself as a feminist,
p84
aVmy mother, but she always used to say,
p85
aV"Anything a man can do, I can fix."
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aVAnd when my father complained about this situation,
p88
aVwhere she's taking a seven-year-old boy
p89
aVto teach this birth control, you know,
p90
aVhe used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into \u2014
p91
aVyou're teaching him how to be a woman."
p92
aVMy mother said, "Someone has to."
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VThis woman \u2014 during the Biafran war,
p96
aVwe were caught in the war.
p97
aVIt was my mother with five little children.
p98
aVIt takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,
p99
aVto make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.
p100
aVAt every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers
p101
aVwho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,
p102
aVand make him a boy soldier.
p103
aVCan you imagine this five-foot-two woman,
p104
aVstanding up to men with guns who want to kill us?
p105
aVAll through that one year,
p106
aVmy mother never cried one time, not once.
p107
aVBut when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,
p108
aVabout to fly to England,
p109
aVthis woman saw my mother wearing this dress,
p110
aVwhich had been washed so many times it was basically see through,
p111
aVwith five really hungry-looking kids,
p112
aVcame over and asked her what had happened.
p113
aVAnd she told this woman.
p114
aVAnd so this woman emptied out her suitcase
p115
aVand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,
p116
aVand the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but \u2014
p117
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p118
aVthat was the only time she cried.
p119
aVAnd I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,
p120
aVand I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"
p121
aVAnd she said, "You know, you can steel your heart
p122
aVagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.
p123
aVBut the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger
p124
aVwill unstitch you."
p125
aa(lp126
VThe old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,
p127
aVmemorized the names of every dead person,
p128
aVand they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.
p129
aVDirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.
p130
aVAnd they would sing them only when they planted the rice,
p131
aVas though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
p132
aVinto the rice.
p133
aVBut when it came for harvest time,
p134
aVthey would sing these joyful songs,
p135
aVthat were made up of the names of every child
p136
aVwho had been born that year.
p137
aVAnd then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,
p138
aVthey would remove as many names of the dead
p139
aVthat equaled as many people that were born.
p140
aVAnd in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,
p141
aVbeautiful transformation.
p142
aa(lp143
VDid you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,
p144
aVthe word for rape and the word for marriage
p145
aVwas the same one?
p146
aVBut today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.
p147
aVDid you also know that after apartheid,
p148
aVwhen the new government went into the parliament houses,
p149
aVthere were no female toilets in the building?
p150
aVWhich would seem to suggest that apartheid
p151
aVwas entirely the business of men.
p152
aVAll of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,
p153
aVwomen are never really counted.
p154
aVTheir humanity never seems to matter very much to us.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhen I was growing up in Nigeria \u2014
p157
aVand I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,
p158
aVbut in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from \u2014
p159
aVthere were always rites of passage for young men.
p160
aVMen were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,
p161
aVthat's essentially what it is.
p162
aVAnd a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,
p163
aVprogressing along, so when I turned 13 \u2014
p164
aVand, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,
p165
aVsomebody had to kill the animals,
p166
aVthere was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at \u2014
p167
aVso when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.
p168
aVAnd I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,
p169
aVbut I had to do it.
p170
aVAnd I was supposed to do this alone.
p171
aVBut a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,
p172
aVwho was significantly older than me,
p173
aVwho'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,
p174
aVdecided to come with me.
p175
aVWhich sort of made me feel good,
p176
aVbecause he'd seen a lot of things.
p177
aVNow, when I was growing up, he used to tell me
p178
aVstories about how he used to bayonet people,
p179
aVand their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.
p180
aVSo, this guy comes with me.
p181
aVAnd I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one \u2014
p182
aVthey sound like human beings,
p183
aVthat's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."
p184
aVMy friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human
p185
aVuntil we started keeping goats.
p186
aVAnyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.
p187
aVSo when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,
p188
aVEmmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,
p189
aVcovers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,
p190
aVwhile I kill the goat.
p191
aVIt didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,
p192
aVand to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed
p193
aVsuch a quotidian experience,
p194
aVstill found it in himself to try to protect me.
p195
aVI was a wimp.
p196
aVI cried for a very long time.
p197
aVAnd afterwards, he didn't say a word.
p198
aVHe just sat there watching me cry for an hour.
p199
aVAnd then afterwards he said to me,
p200
aV"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,
p201
aVyou will die of heartbreak.
p202
aVJust know that it is enough sometimes
p203
aVto know that it is difficult."
p204
aVOf course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,
p205
aVand not in good ways.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VSo, I was born two days after Christmas.
p209
aVSo growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,
p210
aVbut I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.
p211
aVSo, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,
p212
aVand we had the Catholic priest over,
p213
aVmy mother was entertaining him with tea.
p214
aVAnd my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"
p215
aVAnd my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."
p216
aVBut he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,
p217
aVso he summoned me up, and he said,
p218
aV"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.
p219
aVTake anything you want out of the suitcase.
p220
aVIt's your birthday present."
p221
aVI'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,
p222
aVbut I found an inflatable sheep.
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVSo, I blew it up and ran into the living room,
p225
aVmy finger where it shouldn't have been,
p226
aVI was waving this buzzing sheep around,
p227
aVand my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVAnd Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,
p230
aVjust stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,
p231
aV"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aV(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VMy last days in prison, the last 18 months,
p236
aVmy cellmate \u2014 for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months \u2014
p237
aVmy cellmate was 14 years old.
p238
aVThe name was John James,
p239
aVand in those days, if a family member committed a crime,
p240
aVthe military would hold you as ransom
p241
aVtill your family turned themselves in.
p242
aVSo, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.
p243
aVAnd not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.
p244
aVThere were some really bad people there.
p245
aVAnd he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books \u2014
p246
aV"Spiderman" and "X-Men."
p247
aVHe was obsessed.
p248
aVAnd when he got tired of reading them,
p249
aVhe started to teach the men in death row how to read,
p250
aVwith these comic books.
p251
aVAnd so, I remember night after night,
p252
aVyou'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,
p253
aVhuddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aVIt's incredible.
p256
aVI was really worried.
p257
aVHe didn't know what death row meant.
p258
aVI'd been there twice,
p259
aVand I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.
p260
aVAnd he would always laugh, and say,
p261
aV"Come on, man, we'll make it out."
p262
aVThen I'd say, "How do you know?"
p263
aVAnd he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."
p264
aVThey killed him.
p265
aVThey handcuffed him to a chair,
p266
aVand they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,
p267
aVthen left him there to bleed to death.
p268
aVThat's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.
p269
aVAll around us, everywhere, there are people like this.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.
p272
aVThey would come together as a community,
p273
aVand they would express a wish.
p274
aVAnd their wish would then be brought to a priest,
p275
aVwho would find a ritual object,
p276
aVand the appropriate sacrifices would be made,
p277
aVand the shrine would be built for the god.
p278
aVBut if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,
p279
aVthe Igbos would destroy the god.
p280
aVThey would knock down the shrine,
p281
aVand they would stop saying the god's name.
p282
aVThis is how they came to reclaim their humanity.
p283
aVEvery day, all of us here,
p284
aVwe're building gods that have gone rampant,
p285
aVand it's time we started knocking them down
p286
aVand forgetting their names.
p287
aVIt doesn't require a tremendous thing.
p288
aVAll it requires is to recognize among us, every day \u2014
p289
aVthe few of us that can see \u2014 are surrounded by people
p290
aVlike the ones I've told you.
p291
aa(lp292
VThere are some of you in this room, amazing people,
p293
aVwho offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.
p294
aVI want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.
p295
aVThe poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi
p296
aVwho is in the audience here somewhere.
p297
aV"Libation,
p298
aVNorth Carolina, 1999.
p299
aVI offer to this ground, this gin.
p300
aVI imagine an old man crying here,
p301
aVout of the sight of the overseer.
p302
aVHe pushes his tongue through a hole
p303
aVwhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.
p304
aVIt aches in that space where his tooth would be,
p305
aVwhere his land would be,
p306
aVhis house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.
p307
aVHe wipes sorrow from his face,
p308
aVand puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,
p309
aVand tastes the salt.
p310
aVI call a name that could be his.
p311
aVThis is for you, old man.
p312
aVThis gin, this salty earth."
