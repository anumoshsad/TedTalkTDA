VSo, we used to solve big problems.
p4
aVOn July 21st, 1969,
p5
aVBuzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module
p6
aVand descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
p7
aVArmstrong and Aldrin were alone,
p8
aVbut their presence on the moon's gray surface
p9
aVwas the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe Apollo program was the greatest
p12
aVpeacetime mobilization
p13
aVin the history of the United States.
p14
aVTo get to the moon, NASA spent
p15
aVaround 180 billion dollars in today's money,
p16
aVor four percent of the federal budget.
p17
aVApollo employed around 400,000 people
p18
aVand demanded the collaboration of 20,000
p19
aVcompanies, universities and government agencies.
p20
aVPeople died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
p21
aVBut before the Apollo program ended,
p22
aV24 men flew to the moon.
p23
aVTwelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,
p24
aVfollowing the death of Armstrong last year,
p25
aVis now the most senior.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo why did they go?
p28
aVThey didn't bring much back:
p29
aV841 pounds of old rocks,
p30
aVand something all 24 later emphasized \u2014
p31
aVa new sense of the smallness
p32
aVand the fragility of our common home.
p33
aVWhy did they go? The cynical answer is they went
p34
aVbecause President Kennedy wanted to show
p35
aVthe Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
p36
aVBut Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962
p37
aVprovide a better clue.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?
p40
aVWhy choose this as our goal?
p41
aVAnd they may well ask,
p42
aVwhy climb the highest mountain?
p43
aVWhy, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
p44
aVWhy does Rice play Texas?
p45
aVWe choose to go to the moon.
p46
aVWe choose to go to the moon.
p47
aV(Applause)
p48
aVWe choose to go to the moon in this decade,
p49
aVand do the other things,
p50
aVnot because they are easy, but because they are hard.
p51
aa(lp52
VJason Pontin: To contemporaries,
p53
aVApollo wasn't only a victory of West over East
p54
aVin the Cold War.
p55
aVAt the time, the strongest emotion
p56
aVwas of wonder
p57
aVat the transcendent powers of technology.
p58
aVThey went because it was a big thing to do.
p59
aVLanding on the moon occurred in the context
p60
aVof a long series of technological triumphs.
p61
aVThe first half of the 20th century produced
p62
aVthe assembly line and the airplane,
p63
aVpenicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
p64
aVIn the middle years of the century,
p65
aVpolio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
p66
aVTechnology itself seemed to possess
p67
aVwhat Alvin Toffler in 1970
p68
aVcalled "accelerative thrust."
p69
aVFor most of human history,
p70
aVwe could go no faster than a horse
p71
aVor a boat with a sail,
p72
aVbut in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10
p73
aVflew at 25,000 miles an hour.
p74
aa(lp75
VSince 1970, no human beings
p76
aVhave been back to the moon.
p77
aVNo one has traveled faster than the crew
p78
aVof Apollo 10,
p79
aVand blithe optimism about technology's powers
p80
aVhas evaporated
p81
aVas big problems we had imagined technology would solve,
p82
aVsuch as going to Mars,
p83
aVcreating clean energy, curing cancer,
p84
aVor feeding the world have come to seem
p85
aVintractably hard.
p86
aa(lp87
VI remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
p88
aVI was five years old,
p89
aVand my mother told me not to stare
p90
aVat the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
p91
aVI vaguely knew this was to be the last
p92
aVof the moon missions,
p93
aVbut I was absolutely certain there would be
p94
aVMars colonies in my lifetime.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo "Something happened
p97
aVto our capacity to solve big problems with technology"
p98
aVhas become a commonplace.
p99
aVYou hear it all the time.
p100
aVWe've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
p101
aVIt feels as if technologists have diverted us
p102
aVand enriched themselves with trivial toys,
p103
aVwith things like iPhones and apps and social media,
p104
aVor algorithms that speed automated trading.
p105
aVThere's nothing wrong with most of these things.
p106
aVThey've expanded and enriched our lives.
p107
aVBut they don't solve humanity's big problems.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat happened?
p110
aVSo there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,
p111
aVwhich admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies
p112
aVthan it did in the years when it financed
p113
aVIntel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
p114
aVSilicon Valley says the markets are to blame,
p115
aVin particular the incentives that venture capitalists
p116
aVoffer to entrepreneurs.
p117
aVSilicon Valley says that venture investing
p118
aVshifted away from funding transformational ideas
p119
aVand towards funding incremental problems
p120
aVor even fake problems.
p121
aVBut I don't think that explanation is good enough.
p122
aVIt mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
p123
aVEven when venture capitalists were at their most
p124
aVrisk-happy, they preferred small investments,
p125
aVtiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
p126
aVV.C.s have always struggled
p127
aVto invest profitably in technologies such as energy
p128
aVwhose capital requirements are huge
p129
aVand whose development is long and lengthy,
p130
aVand V.C.s have never, never funded the development
p131
aVof technologies meant to solve big problems
p132
aVthat possess no immediate commercial value.
p133
aVNo, the reasons we can't solve big problems
p134
aVare more complicated and more profound.
p135
aa(lp136
VSometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
p137
aVWe could go to Mars if we want.
p138
aVNASA even has the outline of a plan.
p139
aVBut going to Mars would follow a political decision
p140
aVwith popular appeal, and that will never happen.
p141
aVWe won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks
p142
aVthere are more important things
p143
aVto do here on Earth.
p144
aa(lp145
VSometimes, we can't solve big problems
p146
aVbecause our political systems fail.
p147
aVToday, less than two percent
p148
aVof the world's energy consumption
p149
aVderives from advanced, renewable sources
p150
aVsuch as solar, wind and biofuels,
p151
aVless than two percent,
p152
aVand the reason is purely economic.
p153
aVCoal and natural gas are cheaper
p154
aVthan solar and wind,
p155
aVand petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
p156
aVWe want alternative energy sources
p157
aVthat can compete on price. None exist.
p158
aVNow, technologists, business leaders
p159
aVand economists all basically agree
p160
aVon what national policies and international treaties
p161
aVwould spur the development of alternative energy:
p162
aVmostly, a significant increase in energy
p163
aVresearch and development,
p164
aVand some kind of price on carbon.
p165
aVBut there's no hope in the present political climate
p166
aVthat we will see U.S. energy policy
p167
aVor international treaties that reflect that consensus.
p168
aa(lp169
VSometimes, big problems that had seemed technological
p170
aVturn out not to be so.
p171
aVFamines were long understood to be caused
p172
aVby failures in food supply.
p173
aVBut 30 years of research have taught us
p174
aVthat famines are political crises
p175
aVthat catastrophically affect food distribution.
p176
aVTechnology can improve things like crop yields
p177
aVor systems for storing and transporting food,
p178
aVbut there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
p179
aa(lp180
VFinally, big problems sometimes elude solution
p181
aVbecause we don't really understand the problem.
p182
aVPresident Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,
p183
aVbut we soon discovered
p184
aVthere are many kinds of cancer,
p185
aVmost of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,
p186
aVand it is only in the last 10 years
p187
aVthat effective, viable therapies
p188
aVhave come to seem real.
p189
aVHard problems are hard.
p190
aa(lp191
VIt's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
p192
aVWe can, we must, but these four elements
p193
aVmust all be present:
p194
aVPolitical leaders and the public
p195
aVmust care to solve a problem;
p196
aVinstitutions must support its solution;
p197
aVIt must really be a technological problem;
p198
aVand we must understand it.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe Apollo mission,
p201
aVwhich has become a kind of metaphor
p202
aVfor technology's capacity to solve big problems,
p203
aVmet these criteria.
p204
aVBut it is an irreproducible model for the future.
p205
aVIt is not 1961.
p206
aVThere is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,
p207
aVno politician like John Kennedy
p208
aVwho can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,
p209
aVand no popular science fictional mythology
p210
aVsuch as exploring the solar system.
p211
aVMost of all, going to the moon
p212
aVturned out to be easy.
p213
aVIt was just three days away.
p214
aVAnd arguably it wasn't even solving
p215
aVmuch of a problem.
p216
aa(lp217
VWe are left alone with our day,
p218
aVand the solutions of the future will be harder won.
p219
aVGod knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you very much.
