VIn 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,
p4
aVboarded a flight from Minneapolis
p5
aVto the Horn of Africa.
p6
aVAnd while Burhan was the youngest recruit,
p7
aVhe was not alone.
p8
aVAl-Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men
p9
aVin their late teens and early 20s
p10
aVwith a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook.
p11
aVWith the Internet and other technologies,
p12
aVthey've changed our everyday lives,
p13
aVbut they've also changed recruitment, radicalization
p14
aVand the front lines of conflict today.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat about the links connecting Twitter,
p17
aVGoogle and protesters fighting for democracy?
p18
aVThese numbers represent Google's public DNS servers,
p19
aVeffectively the only digital border crossing
p20
aVprotesters had and could use
p21
aVto communicate with each other, to reach the outside world
p22
aVand to spread viral awareness
p23
aVof what was happening in their own country.
p24
aa(lp25
VToday, conflict is essentially borderless.
p26
aVIf there are bounds to conflict today,
p27
aVthey're bound by digital, not physical geography.
p28
aVAnd under all this is a vacuum of power
p29
aVwhere non-state actors, individuals and private organizations
p30
aVhave the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies.
p31
aVAnd this is because, in the digital age of conflict,
p32
aVthere exists a feedback loop
p33
aVwhere new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned,
p34
aVand more disruptive ones,
p35
aVcan be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations
p36
aVfaster than governments can react.
p37
aa(lp38
VTo understand the pace of our own government thinking on this,
p39
aVI like to turn to something aptly named
p40
aVthe Worldwide Threat Assessment,
p41
aVwhere every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US
p42
aVlooks at the global threat landscape,
p43
aVand he says, "These are the threats, these are the details,
p44
aVand this is how we rank them."
p45
aVIn 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security.
p46
aVIt took until 2011, when it came at the end,
p47
aVwhere other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence.
p48
aVIn 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation.
p49
aVIn 2013, it became the top threat,
p50
aVin 2014 and for the foreseeable future.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat things like that show us
p53
aVis that there is a fundamental inability today
p54
aVon the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict,
p55
aVwhere conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable.
p56
aVAnd conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization,
p57
aVbut it goes the other way as well.
p58
aa(lp59
VWe all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year
p60
aVwith the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.
p61
aVWhat an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did
p62
aVwas enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.
p63
aV#JeSuisCharlie.
p64
aVOn Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,
p65
aVall sorts of places where millions of people, myself included,
p66
aVwere talking about the events
p67
aVand saw images like this,
p68
aVthe emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.
p69
aVAnd this turned into a weapon.
p70
aVWhat the hackers did was weaponize this image,
p71
aVwhere unsuspecting victims,
p72
aVlike all of us in those conversations,
p73
aVsaw this image, downloaded it
p74
aVbut it was embedded with malware.
p75
aVAnd so when you downloaded this image,
p76
aVit hacked your system.
p77
aVIt took six days to deploy a global malware campaign.
p78
aVThe divide between physical and digital domains today
p79
aVceases to exist,
p80
aVwhere we have offline attacks like those in Paris
p81
aVappropriated for online hacks.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd it goes the other way as well, with recruitment.
p84
aVWe see online radicalization of teens,
p85
aVwho can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks.
p86
aa(lp87
VWith all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing,
p88
aVand governments don't necessarily take a part.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo in another case, Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.
p91
aVIn early September 2011 in Mexico,
p92
aVLos Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels,
p93
aVhung two bloggers with a sign that said,
p94
aV"This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies."
p95
aVA week later, they beheaded a young girl.
p96
aVThey severed her head, put it on top of her computer
p97
aVwith a similar note.
p98
aVAnd taking the digital counteroffensive
p99
aVbecause governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act,
p100
aVAnonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world,
p101
aVtook action,
p102
aVnot in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free.
p103
aVOn social media, they said,
p104
aV"We will release information
p105
aVthat ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."
p106
aVAnd escalating that conflict,
p107
aVLos Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release."
p108
aVAnd so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue.
p109
aVBut what was powerful about this
p110
aVwas that anonymous individuals,
p111
aVnot federal policia, not military, not politicians,
p112
aVcould strike fear deep into the heart
p113
aVof one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world.
p114
aVAnd so we live in an era
p115
aVthat lacks the clarity of the past in conflict,
p116
aVin who we're fighting, in the motivations behind attacks,
p117
aVin the tools and techniques used,
p118
aVand how quickly they evolve.
p119
aVAnd the question still remains:
p120
aVwhat can individuals, organizations and governments do?
p121
aa(lp122
VFor answers to these questions, it starts with individuals,
p123
aVand I think peer-to-peer security is the answer.
p124
aVThose people in relationships that bought over teens online,
p125
aVwe can do that with peer-to-peer security.
p126
aVIndividuals have more power than ever before
p127
aVto affect national and international security.
p128
aVAnd we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships
p129
aVon and offline,
p130
aVwe can support and educate the next generation of hackers, like myself,
p131
aVinstead of saying, "You can either be a criminal or join the NSA."
p132
aVThat matters today.
p133
aVAnd it's not just individuals \u2014 it's organizations, corporations even.
p134
aVThey have an advantage to act across more borders,
p135
aVmore effectively and more rapidly than governments can,
p136
aVand there's a set of real incentives there.
p137
aVIt's profitable and valuable
p138
aVto be seen as trustworthy in the digital age,
p139
aVand will only be more so in future generations to come.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut we still can't ignore government,
p142
aVbecause that's who we turn to for collective action
p143
aVto keep us safe and secure.
p144
aVBut we see where that's gotten us so far,
p145
aVwhere there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict,
p146
aVwhere at the highest levels of leadership,
p147
aVthe Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense,
p148
aVthey say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen." "Cyber 9/11 is imminent."
p149
aVBut this only makes us more fearful, not more secure.
p150
aVBy banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking,
p151
aVsure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.
p152
aVBut that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can.
p153
aVCapabilities are cheap, even free.
p154
aVTechnical ability is rising around the world,
p155
aVand individuals and small groups have the advantage.
p156
aVSo today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ,
p157
aVbut who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor?
p158
aVOr in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so I would say that it's not what governments can do,
p161
aVit's that they can't.
p162
aVGovernments today need to give up power and control
p163
aVin order to help make us more secure.
p164
aVGiving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors
p165
aVmeans that, yeah, they can't spy on us,
p166
aVbut neither can the Chinese
p167
aVor that hacker in Estonia a generation from now.
p168
aVAnd government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin
p169
aVmean giving up control,
p170
aVbut it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection,
p171
aVin countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products,
p172
aVin the global marketplace,
p173
aVbut more importantly sell their ideas,
p174
aVshow us what's happening in their own countries.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd so it should be not fearful,
p177
aVit should be inspiring to the same governments
p178
aVthat fought for civil rights, free speech and democracy
p179
aVin the great wars of the last century,
p180
aVthat today, for the first time in human history,
p181
aVwe have a technical opportunity
p182
aVto make billions of people safer around the world
p183
aVthat we've never had before in human history.
p184
aVIt should be inspiring.
