VFifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,
p4
aVa team of engineers was secretly moving a large object
p5
aVthrough a desolate countryside.
p6
aVWith it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere
p7
aVby being the first to conquer outer space.
p8
aVThe rocket was huge.
p9
aVAnd packed in its nose was a silver ball
p10
aVwith two radios inside.
p11
aa(lp12
VOn October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
p13
aVOne of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:
p14
aV"We are about to create a new planet
p15
aVthat we will call Sputnik.
p16
aVIn the olden days, explorers
p17
aVlike Vasco da Gama and Columbus
p18
aVhad the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
p19
aVNow we have the good fortune to open up space.
p20
aVAnd it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."
p21
aa(lp22
VYou're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,
p23
aVwhich is just about completed.
p24
aVIt tells the story of Sputnik,
p25
aVand the story of what happened to America as a result.
p26
aVFor days after the launch,
p27
aVSputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
p28
aVA man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,
p29
aVit inspired awe and pride
p30
aVthat humans had finally launched an object into space.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,
p33
aVthe media and the politicians told us,
p34
aVand we believed, that Sputnik was proof
p35
aVthat our enemy had beaten us
p36
aVin science and technology,
p37
aVand that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,
p38
aVusing their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
p39
aa(lp40
VAll hell broke loose.
p41
aVSputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America \u2014
p42
aVhistorians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.
p43
aVIt provoked the missile gap.
p44
aVIt exploded an arms race.
p45
aVIt began the space race.
p46
aVWithin a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,
p47
aVand we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons
p48
aVto 20,000.
p49
aVAnd the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
p50
aa(lp51
VFor example, some here will remember
p52
aVthis day, June 1958,
p53
aVthe National Civil Defense Drill,
p54
aVwhere tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
p55
aVOr the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans
p56
aVbelieved that a nuclear war would happen,
p57
aVand that at least 50 percent of our population
p58
aVwas going to be killed.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
p61
aVFor example, some in this room went to school on scholarship
p62
aVbecause of Sputnik.
p63
aVSupport for engineering, math and science \u2014
p64
aVeducation in general \u2014 boomed.
p65
aVAnd Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik
p66
aVled directly to ARPA, and the Internet,
p67
aVand, of course, NASA.
p68
aa(lp69
VMy feature documentary shows how a free society
p70
aVcan be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
p71
aVBut it also shows how we can turn
p72
aVwhat appears at first to be a bad situation,
p73
aVinto something that was overall very good for America.
p74
aV"Sputnik" will soon be released.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn closing, I would like to take a moment to thank
p77
aVone of my investors:
p78
aVlongtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
p79
aVAnd I'd like to thank you all.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause).
p82
aa(lp83
VThank you, Chris.
