VI'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.
p4
aVNow, usually when I mention suspended animation,
p5
aVpeople will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.
p6
aVBut now, I'm not talking about gorking people out
p7
aVto fly to Mars or even Pandora,
p8
aVas much fun as that may be.
p9
aVI'm talking about
p10
aVthe concept of using suspended animation
p11
aVto help people out in trauma.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo what do I mean
p14
aVwhen I say "suspended animation"?
p15
aVIt is the process by which
p16
aVanimals de-animate,
p17
aVappear dead
p18
aVand then can wake up again without being harmed.
p19
aVOK, so here is the sort of big idea:
p20
aVIf you look out at nature,
p21
aVyou find that
p22
aVas you tend to see suspended animation,
p23
aVyou tend to see immortality.
p24
aVAnd so, what I'm going to tell you about
p25
aVis a way to tell a person who's in trauma \u2014
p26
aVfind a way to de-animate them a bit
p27
aVso they're a little more immortal
p28
aVwhen they have that heart attack.
p29
aa(lp30
VAn example of an organism or two
p31
aVthat happens to be quite immortal
p32
aVwould be plant seeds
p33
aVor bacterial spores.
p34
aVThese creatures are
p35
aVsome of the most immortal life forms on our planet,
p36
aVand they tend to spend most of their time
p37
aVin suspended animation.
p38
aVBacterial spores are thought now by scientists
p39
aVto exist as individual cells
p40
aVthat are alive, but in suspended animation
p41
aVfor as long as 250 million years.
p42
aVTo suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,
p43
aVI want to bring it close to home.
p44
aVIn the immortal germ line
p45
aVof human beings \u2014
p46
aVthat is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries \u2014
p47
aVthey actually sit there in a state of suspended animation
p48
aVfor up to 50 years in the life of each woman.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo then there's also my favorite example
p51
aVof suspended animation.
p52
aVThis is Sea-Monkeys.
p53
aVThose of you with children,
p54
aVyou know about them.
p55
aVYou go to the pet store or the toy store,
p56
aVand you can buy these things.
p57
aVYou just open the bag, and you just dump them
p58
aVinto the plastic aquarium,
p59
aVand in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.
p60
aVWell, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.
p61
aVI was interested in what was going on in the bag,
p62
aVthe bag on the toy store shelf
p63
aVwhere those shrimp sat
p64
aVin suspended animation indefinitely.
p65
aVSo these ideas of suspended animation
p66
aVare not just about cells and weird, little organisms.
p67
aa(lp68
VOccasionally, human beings
p69
aVare briefly de-animated,
p70
aVand the stories of people who are briefly de-animated
p71
aVthat interest me the most
p72
aVare those having to do with the cold.
p73
aVTen years ago, there was a skier in Norway
p74
aVthat was trapped in an icy waterfall,
p75
aVand she was there for two hours before they extracted her.
p76
aVShe was extremely cold,
p77
aVand she had no heartbeat \u2014
p78
aVfor all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.
p79
aVSeven hours later,
p80
aVstill without a heartbeat,
p81
aVthey brought her back to life, and she went on to be
p82
aVthe head radiologist
p83
aVin the hospital that treated her.
p84
aa(lp85
VA couple of years later \u2014
p86
aVso I get really excited about these things \u2014
p87
aVabout a couple of years later,
p88
aVthere was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.
p89
aVHer father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,
p90
aVand she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.
p91
aVAnd they found her hours later,
p92
aVfrozen, lifeless,
p93
aVand they brought her back to life.
p94
aa(lp95
VThere was a 65-year-old woman
p96
aVin Duluth, Minnesota last year
p97
aVthat was found frozen and without a pulse
p98
aVin her front yard one morning in the winter,
p99
aVand they brought her back to life.
p100
aVThe next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.
p101
aVShe got cranky and just went home.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, these are miracles, right?
p105
aVThese are truly miraculous things that happen.
p106
aVDoctors have a saying
p107
aVthat, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."
p108
aVAnd it's true. It's true.
p109
aVIn the New England Journal of Medicine,
p110
aVthere was a study published that showed
p111
aVthat with appropriate rewarming,
p112
aVpeople who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours
p113
aVcould be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.
p114
aVThat's over 50 percent.
p115
aVSo what I was trying to do is think of a way
p116
aVthat we could study
p117
aVsuspended animation
p118
aVto think about a way
p119
aVto reproduce, maybe,
p120
aVwhat happened to the skier.
p121
aa(lp122
VWell, I have to tell you something very odd,
p123
aVand that is that being exposed to low oxygen
p124
aVdoes not always kill.
p125
aVSo, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,
p126
aVand if we reduce the oxygen concentration,
p127
aVwe will all be dead.
p128
aVAnd, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab \u2014
p129
aVthese little garden worms, nematodes \u2014
p130
aVthey were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.
p131
aVAnd here's the thing that should freak you out.
p132
aVAnd that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further
p133
aVby 100 times, to 10 parts per million,
p134
aVthey were not dead,
p135
aVthey were in suspended animation,
p136
aVand we could bring them back to life without any harm.
p137
aVAnd this precise oxygen concentration,
p138
aV10 parts per million,
p139
aVthat caused suspended animation,
p140
aVis conserved.
p141
aVWe can see it in a variety of different organisms.
p142
aVOne of the creatures we see it in
p143
aVis a fish.
p144
aVAnd we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out
p145
aVof suspended animation like you would a light switch.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo this was pretty shocking to me,
p148
aVthat we could do this.
p149
aVAnd so I was wondering, when we were trying
p150
aVto reproduce the work with the skier,
p151
aVthat we noticed that, of course,
p152
aVshe had no oxygen consumption,
p153
aVand so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.
p154
aVBut, of course, she was also extremely cold.
p155
aVSo we wondered what would happen
p156
aVif we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.
p157
aVAnd so, what we found out
p158
aVwas that, if you take animals
p159
aVthat are animated like you and I,
p160
aVand you make them cold \u2014 that is, these were the garden worms \u2014
p161
aVnow they're dead.
p162
aVBut if you have them in suspended animation,
p163
aVand move them into the cold, they're all alive.
p164
aVAnd there's the very important thing there:
p165
aVIf you want to survive the cold,
p166
aVyou ought to be suspended. Right?
p167
aVIt's a really good thing.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd so, we were thinking about that,
p170
aVabout this relationship between these things,
p171
aVand thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.
p172
aVAnd so we wondered: Might there be some agent
p173
aVthat is in us, something that we make ourselves,
p174
aVthat we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility
p175
aVin such a way as to be able to survive
p176
aVwhen we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?
p177
aVI thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.
p178
aVYou know?
p179
aa(lp180
VI should mention briefly here
p181
aVthat physiology textbooks that you can read about
p182
aVwill tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.
p183
aVWe have, from the time we are slapped on the butt
p184
aVuntil we take our last dying breath \u2014
p185
aVthat's when we're newborn to when we're dead \u2014
p186
aVwe cannot reduce our metabolic rate
p187
aVbelow what's called a standard,
p188
aVor basal metabolic rate.
p189
aVBut I knew that there were examples
p190
aVof creatures, also mammals,
p191
aVthat do reduce their metabolic rate
p192
aVsuch as ground squirrels and bears,
p193
aVthey reduce their metabolic rate
p194
aVin the wintertime when they hibernate.
p195
aVSo I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger
p196
aVthat might induce such a state in us?
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd so, we went looking for such things.
p199
aVAnd this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.
p200
aVKen Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.
p201
aVWell, we had a lot of them.
p202
aVWe tried many different chemicals and agents,
p203
aVand we failed over and over again.
p204
aVSo, one time, I was at home
p205
aVwatching television on the couch
p206
aVwhile my wife was putting our child to bed,
p207
aVand I was watching a television show.
p208
aVIt was a television show \u2014
p209
aVit was a NOVA show on PBS \u2014
p210
aVabout caves in New Mexico.
p211
aVAnd this particular cave was Lechuguilla,
p212
aVand this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
p213
aVThe researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
p214
aVIt's filled with this toxic gas,
p215
aVhydrogen sulfide.
p216
aVNow, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.
p217
aVWe make it ourselves.
p218
aVThe highest concentration is in our brains.
p219
aVYet, it was used
p220
aVas a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
p221
aVIt's an extraordinarily toxic thing.
p222
aVIn fact, in chemical accidents,
p223
aVhydrogen sulfide is known to \u2014
p224
aVif you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,
p225
aVyou appear dead,
p226
aVbut if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,
p227
aVif they do that quickly.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVNow, it's post-9/11 America,
p232
aVand when you go into the research institute,
p233
aVand you say, "Hi.
p234
aVI'd like to buy some concentrated,
p235
aVcompressed gas cylinders
p236
aVof a lethal gas
p237
aVbecause I have these ideas, see,
p238
aVabout wanting to suspend people.
p239
aVIt's really going to be OK."
p240
aVSo that's kind of a tough day,
p241
aVbut I said, "There really is
p242
aVsome basis for thinking why you might want to do this."
p243
aVAs I said, this agent is in us,
p244
aVand, in fact, here's a curious thing,
p245
aVit binds to the very place inside of your cells
p246
aVwhere oxygen binds, and where you burn it,
p247
aVand that you do this burning to live.
p248
aVAnd so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,
p249
aVmight we be able to give a person
p250
aVsome hydrogen sulfide,
p251
aVand might it be able to occupy that place
p252
aVlike in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?
p253
aVAnd because you can't bind the oxygen,
p254
aVmaybe you wouldn't consume it,
p255
aVand then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.
p256
aVI mean, who knows?
p257
aa(lp258
VSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p259
aVSo, there's the bit about the dopamine
p260
aVand being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,
p261
aVand you might suggest that was it.
p262
aVAnd so, we wanted to find out
p263
aVmight we be able to use
p264
aVhydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,
p265
aVand we wanted to see whether we could
p266
aVreproduce this skier in a mammal.
p267
aVNow, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,
p268
aVand when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?
p269
aVWe try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees
p270
aVby actually burning more oxygen.
p271
aVSo, it was interesting for us
p272
aVwhen we applied hydrogen sulfide
p273
aVto a mouse when it was also cold
p274
aVbecause what happened is the core temperature
p275
aVof the mouse got cold.
p276
aVIt stopped moving.
p277
aVIt appeared dead.
p278
aVIts oxygen consumption rate
p279
aVfell by tenfold.
p280
aVAnd here's the really important point.
p281
aVI told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
p282
aVIt's rapidly metabolized,
p283
aVand all you have to do after six hours of being
p284
aVin this state of de-animation
p285
aVis simply put the thing out in room air,
p286
aVand it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, this was cosmic.
p289
aVReally. Because we had found a way
p290
aVto de-animate a mammal,
p291
aVand it didn't hurt it.
p292
aVNow, we'd found a way to reduce
p293
aVits oxygen consumption
p294
aVto rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.
p295
aVNow, in this state of de-animation,
p296
aVit could not go out dancing,
p297
aVbut it was not dead,
p298
aVand it was not harmed.
p299
aVSo we started to think: Is this the agent
p300
aVthat might have been present in the skier,
p301
aVand might have she had more of it than someone else,
p302
aVand might that have been able to reduce
p303
aVher demand for oxygen
p304
aVbefore she got so cold that
p305
aVshe otherwise would have died,
p306
aVas we found out with our worm experiments?
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, we wondered:
p309
aVCan we do anything useful
p310
aVwith this capacity to
p311
aVcontrol metabolic flexibility?
p312
aVAnd one of the things we wondered \u2014
p313
aVI'm sure some of you out there are economists,
p314
aVand you know all about supply and demand.
p315
aVAnd when supply is equal to demand,
p316
aVeverything's fine,
p317
aVbut when supply falls,
p318
aVin this case of oxygen,
p319
aVand demand stays high, you're dead.
p320
aVSo, what I just told you
p321
aVis we can now reduce demand.
p322
aVWe ought to be able to lower supply
p323
aVto unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.
p324
aVAnd with money we got from DARPA,
p325
aVwe could show just that.
p326
aVIf you give mice hydrogen sulfide,
p327
aVyou can lower their demand for oxygen,
p328
aVand you can put them into oxygen concentrations
p329
aVthat are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,
p330
aVand they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.
p331
aVWell this was really cool.
p332
aVWe also found out that we could subject animals
p333
aVto otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them
p334
aVif we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo these proof of concept experiments
p337
aVled me to say "I should found a company,
p338
aVand we should take this out to a wider playing field."
p339
aVI founded a company called Ikaria
p340
aVwith others' help.
p341
aVAnd this company, the first thing it did
p342
aVwas make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide
p343
aVan injectable form that we could put in
p344
aVand send it out to physician scientists all over the world
p345
aVwho work on models of critical care medicine,
p346
aVand the results are incredibly positive.
p347
aa(lp348
VIn one model of heart attack,
p349
aVanimals given hydrogen sulfide
p350
aVshowed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage
p351
aVcompared to those who got the standard of care that
p352
aVyou and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.
p353
aVSame is true for organ failure,
p354
aVwhen you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,
p355
aVacute respiratory distress syndrome
p356
aVand damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.
p357
aVSo, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine
p358
aVall over the world saying this is true,
p359
aVso it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide
p360
aVdecreases damage that you receive
p361
aVfrom being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide
p364
aVrequired to get this benefit
p365
aVare low, incredibly low.
p366
aVIn fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim
p367
aVthe metabolism of people much at all
p368
aVto see the benefit I just mentioned,
p369
aVwhich is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.
p370
aVYou don't want to be gorking people out
p371
aVjust to save them, it's really confusing.
p372
aV(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, I want to say that we're in human trials.
p375
aVNow, and so \u2014
p376
aV(Applause)
p377
aVThank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,
p378
aVand we're doing fine, we're now moved on.
p379
aVWe have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.
p380
aVThis has all moved very quickly,
p381
aVand the mouse experiments
p382
aVof hibernating mice happened in 2005;
p383
aVthe first human studies were done in 2008,
p384
aVand we should know in a couple of years
p385
aVwhether it works or not.
p386
aVAnd this all happened really quickly
p387
aVbecause of a lot of help from a lot of people.
p388
aa(lp389
VI want to mention that, first of all,
p390
aVmy wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,
p391
aVso thank you very much.
p392
aVAlso, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab
p393
aVand also others on staff,
p394
aVthe Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington \u2014
p395
aVwonderful place to work.
p396
aVAnd also the wonderful scientists
p397
aVand businesspeople at Ikaria.
p398
aVOne thing those people did out there
p399
aVwas take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,
p400
aVwhich is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,
p401
aVand they fused it with another company
p402
aVthat sells another toxic gas
p403
aVthat's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,
p404
aVand they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die
p405
aVfrom a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.
p406
aVAnd this gas that is delivered in over
p407
aVa thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,
p408
aVnow is approved, on label,
p409
aVand saves thousands of babies a year
p410
aVfrom certain death.
p411
aV(Applause)
p412
aa(lp413
VSo it's really incredible
p414
aVfor me to be a part of this.
p415
aVAnd I want to say that I think we're on the path
p416
aVof understanding metabolic flexibility
p417
aVin a fundamental way,
p418
aVand that in the not too distant future,
p419
aVan EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,
p420
aVor some related compound,
p421
aVto a person suffering severe injuries,
p422
aVand that person might de-animate a bit,
p423
aVthey might become a little more immortal.
p424
aVTheir metabolism will fall
p425
aVas though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.
p426
aVAnd then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,
p427
aVto be transported to the hospital
p428
aVto get the care they need.
p429
aVAnd then, after they get that care \u2014
p430
aVlike the mouse, like the skier,
p431
aVlike the 65-year-old woman \u2014
p432
aVthey'll wake up.
p433
aVA miracle?
p434
aVWe hope not, or maybe we just hope
p435
aVto make miracles a little more common.
p436
aa(lp437
VThank you very much.
