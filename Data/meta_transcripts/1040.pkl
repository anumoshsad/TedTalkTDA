VSo for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky.
p4
aVWe don't live in the world our mothers lived in,
p5
aVour grandmothers lived in,
p6
aVwhere career choices for women were so limited.
p7
aVAnd if you're in this room today,
p8
aVmost of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights,
p9
aVand amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.
p10
aVBut all that aside, we still have a problem,
p11
aVand it's a real problem.
p12
aVAnd the problem is this:
p13
aVWomen are not making it to the top of any profession
p14
aVanywhere in the world.
p15
aVThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.
p16
aV190 heads of state \u2014 nine are women.
p17
aVOf all the people in parliament in the world,
p18
aV13 percent are women.
p19
aVIn the corporate sector, women at the top,
p20
aVC-level jobs, board seats \u2014
p21
aVtops out at 15, 16 percent.
p22
aVThe numbers have not moved since 2002
p23
aVand are going in the wrong direction.
p24
aVAnd even in the non-profit world,
p25
aVa world we sometimes think of as being led by more women,
p26
aVwomen at the top: 20 percent.
p27
aa(lp28
VWe also have another problem,
p29
aVwhich is that women face harder choices
p30
aVbetween professional success and personal fulfillment.
p31
aVA recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers,
p32
aVtwo-thirds of the married men had children
p33
aVand only one-third of the married women had children.
p34
aVA couple of years ago, I was in New York,
p35
aVand I was pitching a deal,
p36
aVand I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices
p37
aVyou can picture.
p38
aVAnd I'm in the meeting \u2014 it's about a three-hour meeting \u2014
p39
aVand two hours in, there needs to be that bio break,
p40
aVand everyone stands up,
p41
aVand the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed.
p42
aVAnd I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office.
p43
aVSo I start looking around for moving boxes,
p44
aVfiguring they just moved in, but I don't see any.
p45
aVAnd so I said, "Did you just move into this office?"
p46
aVAnd he said, "No, we've been here about a year."
p47
aVAnd I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman
p48
aVto have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"
p49
aVAnd he looked at me, and he said,
p50
aV"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo the question is, how are we going to fix this?
p55
aVHow do we change these numbers at the top?
p56
aVHow do we make this different?
p57
aVI want to start out by saying, I talk about this \u2014
p58
aVabout keeping women in the workforce \u2014
p59
aVbecause I really think that's the answer.
p60
aVIn the high-income part of our workforce,
p61
aVin the people who end up at the top \u2014
p62
aVFortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries \u2014
p63
aVthe problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out.
p64
aVNow people talk about this a lot,
p65
aVand they talk about things like flextime and mentoring
p66
aVand programs companies should have to train women.
p67
aVI want to talk about none of that today,
p68
aVeven though that's all really important.
p69
aVToday I want to focus on what we can do as individuals.
p70
aVWhat are the messages we need to tell ourselves?
p71
aVWhat are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us?
p72
aVWhat are the messages we tell our daughters?
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, at the outset, I want to be very clear
p75
aVthat this speech comes with no judgments.
p76
aVI don't have the right answer.
p77
aVI don't even have it for myself.
p78
aVI left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday,
p79
aVand I was getting on the plane for this conference.
p80
aVAnd my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool,
p81
aVdid that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.
p82
aVThis is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.
p83
aVI know no women,
p84
aVwhether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce,
p85
aVwho don't feel that sometimes.
p86
aVSo I'm not saying that staying in the workforce
p87
aVis the right thing for everyone.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy talk today is about what the messages are
p90
aVif you do want to stay in the workforce,
p91
aVand I think there are three.
p92
aVOne, sit at the table.
p93
aVTwo, make your partner a real partner.
p94
aVAnd three, don't leave before you leave.
p95
aVNumber one: sit at the table.
p96
aVJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,
p97
aVwe hosted a very senior government official,
p98
aVand he came in to meet with senior execs
p99
aVfrom around Silicon Valley.
p100
aVAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.
p101
aVHe had these two women who were traveling with him
p102
aVpretty senior in his department,
p103
aVand I kind of said to them,
p104
aV"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,"
p105
aVand they sat on the side of the room.
p106
aVWhen I was in college, my senior year,
p107
aVI took a course called European Intellectual History.
p108
aVDon't you love that kind of thing from college?
p109
aVI wish I could do that now.
p110
aVAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,
p111
aVwho was then a brilliant literary student \u2014
p112
aVand went on to be a brilliant literary scholar \u2014
p113
aVand my brother \u2014 smart guy,
p114
aVbut a water-polo-playing pre-med,
p115
aVwho was a sophomore.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe three of us take this class together.
p118
aVAnd then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin,
p119
aVgoes to all the lectures.
p120
aVI read all the books in English
p121
aVand go to most of the lectures.
p122
aVMy brother is kind of busy.
p123
aVHe reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures,
p124
aVmarches himself up to our room
p125
aVa couple days before the exam to get himself tutored.
p126
aVThe three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.
p127
aVAnd we sit there for three hours \u2014
p128
aVand our little blue notebooks \u2014 yes, I'm that old.
p129
aVWe walk out, we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?"
p130
aVAnd Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point
p131
aVon the Hegelian dialectic."
p132
aVAnd I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected
p133
aVJohn Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow."
p134
aVAnd my brother says,
p135
aV"I got the top grade in the class."
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
V"You got the top grade in the class?
p140
aVYou don't know anything."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VThe problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows:
p145
aVwomen systematically underestimate their own abilities.
p146
aVIf you test men and women,
p147
aVand you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs,
p148
aVmen get it wrong slightly high,
p149
aVand women get it wrong slightly low.
p150
aVWomen do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.
p151
aVA study in the last two years
p152
aVof people entering the workforce out of college
p153
aVshowed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess,
p154
aVare negotiating their first salary,
p155
aVand only seven percent of women.
p156
aVAnd most importantly,
p157
aVmen attribute their success to themselves,
p158
aVand women attribute it to other external factors.
p159
aVIf you ask men why they did a good job,
p160
aVthey'll say, "I'm awesome.
p161
aVObviously. Why are you even asking?"
p162
aVIf you ask women why they did a good job,
p163
aVwhat they'll say is someone helped them,
p164
aVthey got lucky, they worked really hard.
p165
aVWhy does this matter?
p166
aVBoy, it matters a lot.
p167
aVBecause no one gets to the corner office
p168
aVby sitting on the side, not at the table,
p169
aVand no one gets the promotion
p170
aVif they don't think they deserve their success,
p171
aVor they don't even understand their own success.
p172
aa(lp173
VI wish the answer were easy.
p174
aVI wish I could go tell all the young women I work for,
p175
aVthese fabulous women,
p176
aV"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself.
p177
aVOwn your own success."
p178
aVI wish I could tell that to my daughter.
p179
aVBut it's not that simple.
p180
aVBecause what the data shows, above all else, is one thing,
p181
aVwhich is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men
p182
aVand negatively correlated for women.
p183
aVAnd everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.
p184
aa(lp185
VThere's a really good study that shows this really well.
p186
aVThere's a famous Harvard Business School study
p187
aVon a woman named Heidi Roizen.
p188
aVAnd she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley,
p189
aVand she uses her contacts
p190
aVto become a very successful venture capitalist.
p191
aVIn 2002 \u2014 not so long ago \u2014
p192
aVa professor who was then at Columbia University
p193
aVtook that case and made it [Howard] Roizen.
p194
aVAnd he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students.
p195
aVHe changed exactly one word:
p196
aV"Heidi" to "Howard."
p197
aVBut that one word made a really big difference.
p198
aVHe then surveyed the students,
p199
aVand the good news was the students, both men and women,
p200
aVthought Heidi and Howard were equally competent,
p201
aVand that's good.
p202
aVThe bad news was that everyone liked Howard.
p203
aVHe's a great guy. You want to work for him.
p204
aVYou want to spend the day fishing with him.
p205
aVBut Heidi? Not so sure.
p206
aVShe's a little out for herself. She's a little political.
p207
aVYou're not sure you'd want to work for her.
p208
aVThis is the complication.
p209
aVWe have to tell our daughters and our colleagues,
p210
aVwe have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A,
p211
aVto reach for the promotion, to sit at the table,
p212
aVand we have to do it in a world
p213
aVwhere, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that,
p214
aVeven though for their brothers, there are not.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this.
p217
aVAnd I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me,
p218
aVbut I think important.
p219
aVI gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago
p220
aVto about 100 employees,
p221
aVand a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there
p222
aVsitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me.
p223
aVI said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.
p224
aVAnd she said, "I learned something today.
p225
aVI learned that I need to keep my hand up."
p226
aV"What do you mean?"
p227
aVShe said, "You're giving this talk,
p228
aVand you said you would take two more questions.
p229
aVI had my hand up with many other people,
p230
aVand you took two more questions.
p231
aVI put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same,
p232
aVand then you took more questions,
p233
aVonly from the men."
p234
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p235
aV"Wow, if it's me \u2014 who cares about this, obviously \u2014
p236
aVgiving this talk \u2014
p237
aVand during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised,
p238
aVand the women's hands are still raised,
p239
aVhow good are we
p240
aVas managers of our companies and our organizations
p241
aVat seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities
p242
aVmore than women?"
p243
aVWe've got to get women to sit at the table.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Cheers)
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VMessage number two:
p250
aVMake your partner a real partner.
p251
aVI've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce
p252
aVthan we have in the home.
p253
aVThe data shows this very clearly.
p254
aVIf a woman and a man work full-time and have a child,
p255
aVthe woman does twice the amount of housework the man does,
p256
aVand the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does.
p257
aVSo she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one.
p258
aVWho do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more?
p259
aVThe causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them.
p260
aVAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.
p261
aa(lp262
VI think the cause is more complicated.
p263
aVI think, as a society,
p264
aVwe put more pressure on our boys to succeed
p265
aVthan we do on our girls.
p266
aVI know men that stay home
p267
aVand work in the home to support wives with careers,
p268
aVand it's hard.
p269
aVWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there,
p270
aVI notice that the other mommies don't play with him.
p271
aVAnd that's a problem,
p272
aVbecause we have to make it as important a job,
p273
aVbecause it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home,
p274
aVfor people of both genders,
p275
aVif we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)
p278
aa(lp279
VStudies show that households with equal earning
p280
aVand equal responsibility
p281
aValso have half the divorce rate.
p282
aVAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there,
p283
aVthey also have more \u2014
p284
aVhow shall I say this on this stage?
p285
aVThey know each other more in the biblical sense as well.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Cheers)
p288
aa(lp289
VMessage number three:
p290
aVDon't leave before you leave.
p291
aVI think there's a really deep irony
p292
aVto the fact that actions women are taking \u2014
p293
aVand I see this all the time \u2014
p294
aVwith the objective of staying in the workforce
p295
aVactually lead to their eventually leaving.
p296
aVHere's what happens:
p297
aVWe're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy.
p298
aVAnd she starts thinking about having a child,
p299
aVand from the moment she starts thinking about having a child,
p300
aVshe starts thinking about making room for that child.
p301
aV"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?"
p302
aVAnd literally from that moment,
p303
aVshe doesn't raise her hand anymore,
p304
aVshe doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project,
p305
aVshe doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."
p306
aVShe starts leaning back.
p307
aVThe problem is that \u2014
p308
aVlet's say she got pregnant that day, that day \u2014
p309
aVnine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave,
p310
aVsix months to catch your breath \u2014
p311
aVFast-forward two years,
p312
aVmore often \u2014 and as I've seen it \u2014
p313
aVwomen start thinking about this way earlier \u2014
p314
aVwhen they get engaged, or married,
p315
aVwhen they start thinking about having a child,
p316
aVwhich can take a long time.
p317
aVOne woman came to see me about this.
p318
aVShe looked a little young.
p319
aVAnd I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?"
p320
aVAnd she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."
p321
aVShe didn't even have a boyfriend.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VI said, "You're thinking about this just way too early."
p326
aa(lp327
VBut the point is that what happens
p328
aVonce you start kind of quietly leaning back?
p329
aVEveryone who's been through this \u2014
p330
aVand I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home,
p331
aVyour job better be really good to go back,
p332
aVbecause it's hard to leave that kid at home.
p333
aVYour job needs to be challenging.
p334
aVIt needs to be rewarding.
p335
aVYou need to feel like you're making a difference.
p336
aVAnd if two years ago you didn't take a promotion
p337
aVand some guy next to you did,
p338
aVif three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities,
p339
aVyou're going to be bored
p340
aVbecause you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.
p341
aVDon't leave before you leave.
p342
aVStay in.
p343
aVKeep your foot on the gas pedal,
p344
aVuntil the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child \u2014
p345
aVand then make your decisions.
p346
aVDon't make decisions too far in advance,
p347
aVparticularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.
p348
aa(lp349
VMy generation really, sadly,
p350
aVis not going to change the numbers at the top.
p351
aVThey're just not moving.
p352
aVWe are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population \u2014
p353
aVin my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women]
p354
aVat the top of any industry.
p355
aVBut I'm hopeful that future generations can.
p356
aVI think a world where half of our countries and our companies
p357
aVwere run by women, would be a better world.
p358
aVIt's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are,
p359
aVeven though that would be very helpful.
p360
aVI think it would be a better world.
p361
aVI have two children.
p362
aVI have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.
p363
aVI want my son to have a choice
p364
aVto contribute fully in the workforce or at home,
p365
aVand I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed,
p366
aVbut to be liked for her accomplishments.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you.
