VThank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.
p4
aV(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.
p5
aVNow, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.
p6
aVBut I'm going see what happens if I press this button.
p7
aVSure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.
p8
aVWhat happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?
p9
aVWhat is it made of?
p10
aVAnd the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,
p11
aVand they're very much connected with the history of the universe.
p12
aa(lp13
VWe know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more,
p14
aVbut those are at very, very small distances,
p15
aVand we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.
p16
aVThe main thing I want to talk about is this:
p17
aVthat we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics
p18
aVthat beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.
p19
aVAnd why on earth could that be so?
p20
aa(lp21
VWell, here's an example from my own experience.
p22
aVIt's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.
p23
aVThree or four of us, in 1957,
p24
aVput forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.
p25
aVAnd it was in disagreement with seven \u2014 seven, count them, seven experiments.
p26
aVExperiments were all wrong.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd we published before knowing that,
p29
aVbecause we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!
p30
aVThe experiments had to be wrong, and they were.
p31
aVNow our friend over there, Albert Einstein,
p32
aVused to pay very little attention when people said,
p33
aV"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.
p34
aVDC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, why does stuff like that work? That's the question.
p37
aVNow, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.
p38
aVI'll try to make that clear \u2014 partially clear.
p39
aVWhy should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?
p40
aVI'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,
p41
aVand that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.
p42
aVSomewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,
p43
aVmaybe in a another galaxy,
p44
aVthere could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,
p45
aVand are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots.
p46
aa(lp47
VVery likely, none is close enough to interact with us.
p48
aVBut they could be out there, very easily.
p49
aVAnd suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.
p50
aVThey have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,
p51
aVand a brain shaped like a pretzel.
p52
aVWould they really have different laws?
p53
aVThere are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.
p54
aVI think there are laws out there,
p55
aVand we of course don't understand them at any given time very well
p56
aV\u2014 but we try. And we try to get closer and closer.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory
p59
aVof the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law."
p60
aVWe may not even be terribly far from it.
p61
aVBut even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,
p62
aVwe can still think there is one out there,
p63
aVand we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.
p64
aVI think that's the main point to be made.
p65
aVWe express these things mathematically.
p66
aVAnd when the mathematics is very simple \u2014
p67
aVwhen in terms of some mathematical notation,
p68
aVyou can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication \u2014
p69
aVthat's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.
p70
aa(lp71
VHere's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.
p72
aVNewton certainly believed that.
p73
aVAnd he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws."
p74
aVThe basic law, let's say \u2014 here's an assumption.
p75
aVThe assumption is that the basic law really takes the form
p76
aVof a unified theory of all the particles.
p77
aVNow, some people call that a theory of everything.
p78
aVThat's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
p79
aVAnd I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.
p80
aVYou've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter)
p81
aVThere are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.
p84
aVNow, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.
p85
aVAnd in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.
p86
aVBut other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.
p87
aVSo what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.
p88
aVIt's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,
p89
aVor chance outcomes, that are there in addition.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes; they are in addition.
p92
aVSo it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information
p93
aVin the universe around us comes from those accidents,
p94
aVand not just from the fundamental laws.
p95
aVNow, it's often said that getting closer and closer
p96
aVto the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,
p97
aVand then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,
p98
aVand then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.
p99
aVAnd we keep doing that,
p100
aVand build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.
p101
aVWe look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,
p102
aVand in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion,
p105
aVand we get closer and closer to the underlying law,
p106
aVwe see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,
p107
aVand with the next one. We write them out mathematically,
p108
aVand we see they use very similar mathematics.
p109
aVThey require very similar mathematics.
p110
aVThat is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature
p111
aVof what I'm trying to say today.
p112
aVNewton called it \u2014 that's Newton, by the way \u2014 that one.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway,
p115
aVhe said, "nature conformable to herself" \u2014 personifying nature as a female.
p116
aVAnd so what happens is that the new phenomena,
p117
aVthe new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion
p118
aVthat we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.
p119
aVAnd the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin
p120
aVis almost the same as what we need for the next skin.
p121
aVAnd that's why the equations look so simple.
p122
aVBecause they use mathematics we already have.
p123
aa(lp124
VA trivial example is this: Newton found the law of gravity,
p125
aVwhich goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.
p126
aVCoulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.
p127
aVHere's an example of this similarity.
p128
aVYou look at gravity, you see a certain law.
p129
aVThen you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.
p130
aVIt's a very simple example.
p131
aVThere are lots of more sophisticated examples.
p132
aVSymmetry is very important in this discussion.
p133
aVYou know what it means. A circle, for example,
p134
aVis symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.
p135
aVYou rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.
p136
aVYou take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,
p137
aVand all those rotations leave the sphere alone.
p138
aVThey are symmetries of the sphere.
p139
aVSo we say, in general, that there's a symmetry
p140
aVunder certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,
p141
aVor its description, unchanged.
p142
aa(lp143
VMaxwell's equations are of course symmetrical
p144
aVunder rotations of all of space.
p145
aVDoesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,
p146
aVit doesn't leave the \u2014 doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.
p147
aVThere's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,
p148
aVand if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.
p149
aVThen Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,
p150
aVlooked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,
p151
aVwhich are called special relativity.
p152
aVAnd those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore.
p153
aa(lp154
VLet's look. You don't have to know what these things mean, doesn't make any difference.
p155
aVBut you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.
p156
aVYou see above, at the top, a long list
p157
aVof equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.
p158
aVThen, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.
p159
aVThen you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set
p160
aVdown here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.
p161
aVThe more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents
p164
aVgive rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.
p165
aVThe next \u2014 second \u2014 equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.
p166
aVThe only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.
p167
aVSomeday we may find some slight hole in that argument.
p168
aVBut for the moment, that's the case.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.
p171
aVThey should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,
p172
aVso I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter)
p173
aVBut Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang \u2014 (Laughter)
p174
aV\u2014 and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,
p175
aVthis generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.
p176
aVA whole new symmetry.
p177
aVMathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.
p178
aVThey hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics
p179
aV\u2014 didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut then some of us generalized it further. And then it did!
p182
aVAnd it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.
p183
aVSo here we say, again, what we said before:
p184
aVthat each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.
p185
aVSo the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.
p186
aVAnd therefore it looks beautiful
p187
aVbecause we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities.
p190
aVSteps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.
p191
aVSymmetry exhibits the simplicity.
p192
aVAnd then there is self-similarity across the scales \u2014 in other words,
p193
aVfrom one skin of the onion to another one.
p194
aVProximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.
p195
aVThat will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory.
p196
aa(lp197
VHere's what Newton himself said:
p198
aV"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self."
p199
aVOne thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,
p200
aVbut in his day it wasn't taken for granted.
p201
aVThere's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it.
p202
aVFour sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,
p203
aVand he went down to his mother's farm \u2014 because the university was closed \u2014
p204
aVhe saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.
p205
aVAnd he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth
p206
aVcould be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon.
p207
aa(lp208
VThat was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.
p209
aVIt's the same theory of gravity.
p210
aVSo he said that this principle of nature, consonance:
p211
aV"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,
p212
aVI forbore to describe it in that book,
p213
aVlest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... "
p214
aVThat's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.
p215
aV" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book."
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind?
p218
aVThat the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground
p219
aVis the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,
p220
aVand so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.
p221
aVIt's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it
p222
aVand enjoy it, use it, but it's not \u2014 it doesn't stem from the human mind.
p223
aVIt stems from the character of gravity.
p224
aVAnd that's true of all the things we're talking about.
p225
aVThey are properties of the fundamental law.
p226
aVThe fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,
p227
aVand therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply
p228
aVthe phenomenon of the next skin.
p229
aa(lp230
VI say here that Newton did a lot of things that year:
p231
aVgravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.
p232
aVAnd he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation."
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVSo we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.
p235
aVThey follow from the fundamental theory.
p236
aVThey are what we call emergent properties.
p237
aVYou don't need \u2014 you don't need something more to get something more.
p238
aVThat's what emergence means.
p239
aa(lp240
VLife can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.
p241
aVThe human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,
p242
aVthe way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents.
p243
aVIt doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects
p244
aVto know that they follow from more fundamental things, plus accidents.
p245
aVThat's a general rule, and it's critically important to realize that.
p246
aVYou don't need something more in order to get something more.
p247
aVPeople keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar,"
p248
aVand they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?"
p249
aVPresumably, they mean something supernatural.
p250
aVAnyway, there isn't. (Laughter)
p251
aVYou don't need something more to explain something more.
p252
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
