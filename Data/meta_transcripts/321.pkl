VMy talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
p4
aVAnd you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,
p5
aVbut I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,
p6
aVyou'll see a little bit of a relation.
p7
aVIt ties to origami. So let me start.
p8
aVWhat is origami?
p9
aVMost people think they know what origami is. It's this:
p10
aVflapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
p11
aVAnd that is what origami used to be.
p12
aVBut it's become something else.
p13
aVIt's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe common theme \u2014 what makes it origami \u2014
p16
aVis folding is how we create the form.
p17
aVYou know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.
p18
aVIt shows these women playing with these toys.
p19
aVIf you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.
p20
aVEvery Japanese kid
p21
aVlearns how to fold that crane.
p22
aVSo this art has been around for hundreds of years,
p23
aVand you would think something
p24
aVthat's been around that long \u2014 so restrictive, folding only \u2014
p25
aVeverything that could be done has been done a long time ago.
p26
aVAnd that might have been the case.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut in the twentieth century,
p29
aVa Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,
p30
aVand he created tens of thousands of new designs.
p31
aVBut even more importantly, he created a language,
p32
aVa way we could communicate,
p33
aVa code of dots, dashes and arrows.
p34
aVHarkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,
p35
aVwe now have a means of transmitting information
p36
aVwith heredity and selection,
p37
aVand we know where that leads.
p38
aVAnd where it has led in origami
p39
aVis to things like this.
p40
aVThis is an origami figure \u2014
p41
aVone sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.
p42
aVThis, too, is origami,
p43
aVand this shows where we've gone in the modern world.
p44
aVNaturalism. Detail.
p45
aVYou can get horns, antlers \u2014
p46
aVeven, if you look close, cloven hooves.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd it raises a question: what changed?
p49
aVAnd what changed is something
p50
aVyou might not have expected in an art,
p51
aVwhich is math.
p52
aVThat is, people applied mathematical principles
p53
aVto the art,
p54
aVto discover the underlying laws.
p55
aVAnd that leads to a very powerful tool.
p56
aVThe secret to productivity in so many fields \u2014
p57
aVand in origami \u2014
p58
aVis letting dead people do your work for you.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VBecause what you can do is
p63
aVtake your problem,
p64
aVand turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,
p65
aVand use their solutions.
p66
aVAnd I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
p67
aVOrigami revolves around crease patterns.
p68
aVThe crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint
p69
aVfor an origami figure.
p70
aVAnd you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
p71
aVThey have to obey four simple laws.
p72
aVAnd they're very simple, easy to understand.
p73
aVThe first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern
p74
aVwith just two colors without ever having
p75
aVthe same color meeting.
p76
aVThe directions of the folds at any vertex \u2014
p77
aVthe number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds \u2014
p78
aValways differs by two. Two more or two less.
p79
aVNothing else.
p80
aVIf you look at the angles around the fold,
p81
aVyou find that if you number the angles in a circle,
p82
aVall the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,
p83
aVall the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
p84
aVAnd if you look at how the layers stack,
p85
aVyou'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,
p86
aVa sheet can never
p87
aVpenetrate a fold.
p88
aVSo that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.
p89
aVAll of origami comes from that.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd you'd think, "Can four simple laws
p92
aVgive rise to that kind of complexity?"
p93
aVBut indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics
p94
aVcan be written down on a napkin,
p95
aVand yet they govern all of chemistry,
p96
aVall of life, all of history.
p97
aVIf we obey these laws,
p98
aVwe can do amazing things.
p99
aVSo in origami, to obey these laws,
p100
aVwe can take simple patterns \u2014
p101
aVlike this repeating pattern of folds, called textures \u2014
p102
aVand by itself it's nothing.
p103
aVBut if we follow the laws of origami,
p104
aVwe can put these patterns into another fold
p105
aVthat itself might be something very, very simple,
p106
aVbut when we put it together,
p107
aVwe get something a little different.
p108
aVThis fish, 400 scales \u2014
p109
aVagain, it is one uncut square, only folding.
p110
aVAnd if you don't want to fold 400 scales,
p111
aVyou can back off and just do a few things,
p112
aVand add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.
p113
aVOr you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars
p114
aVon a flag, with 13 stripes.
p115
aVAnd if you want to go really crazy,
p116
aV1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
p117
aVAnd this guy's on display downstairs,
p118
aVso take a look if you get a chance.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe most powerful tools in origami
p121
aVhave related to how we get parts of creatures.
p122
aVAnd I can put it in this simple equation.
p123
aVWe take an idea,
p124
aVcombine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat matters is what we mean by those symbols.
p129
aVAnd you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
p130
aVI mean, a stag beetle \u2014 it's got two points for jaws,
p131
aVit's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
p132
aVAnd yeah, you really can.
p133
aVSo how do we do that? Well, we break it down
p134
aVinto a few smaller steps.
p135
aVSo let me stretch out that equation.
p136
aVI start with my idea. I abstract it.
p137
aVWhat's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.
p138
aVAnd from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape
p139
aVthat has a part for every bit of the subject,
p140
aVa flap for every leg.
p141
aVAnd then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,
p142
aVyou can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,
p143
aVyou can turn it into the finished shape.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow the first step, pretty easy.
p146
aVTake an idea, draw a stick figure.
p147
aVThe last step is not so hard, but that middle step \u2014
p148
aVgoing from the abstract description to the folded shape \u2014
p149
aVthat's hard.
p150
aVBut that's the place where the mathematical ideas
p151
aVcan get us over the hump.
p152
aVAnd I'm going to show you all how to do that
p153
aVso you can go out of here and fold something.
p154
aVBut we're going to start small.
p155
aVThis base has a lot of flaps in it.
p156
aVWe're going to learn how to make one flap.
p157
aVHow would you make a single flap?
p158
aVTake a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,
p159
aVuntil it gets long and narrow,
p160
aVand then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
p161
aVI could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat paper went into that flap?
p164
aVWell, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,
p165
aVyou can see that the upper left corner of that shape
p166
aVis the paper that went into the flap.
p167
aVSo that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.
p168
aVI can use it for something else.
p169
aVWell, there are other ways of making a flap.
p170
aVThere are other dimensions for flaps.
p171
aVIf I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.
p172
aVIf I make the flap as skinny as possible,
p173
aVI get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
p174
aVAnd you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
p175
aVThere's other ways of making flaps.
p176
aVIf I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
p177
aVAnd if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
p178
aVSo, no matter how I make a flap,
p179
aVit needs some part
p180
aVof a circular region of paper.
p181
aVSo now we're ready to scale up.
p182
aVWhat if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
p183
aVWhat do I need? I need a lot of circles.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd in the 1990s,
p186
aVorigami artists discovered these principles
p187
aVand realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures
p188
aVjust by packing circles.
p189
aVAnd here's where the dead people start to help us out,
p190
aVbecause lots of people have studied
p191
aVthe problem of packing circles.
p192
aVI can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists
p193
aVlooking at disc packings and arrangements.
p194
aVAnd I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.
p195
aVSo we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,
p196
aVyou decorate the patterns of circles with lines
p197
aVaccording to more rules. That gives you the folds.
p198
aVThose folds fold into a base. You shape the base.
p199
aVYou get a folded shape \u2014 in this case, a cockroach.
p200
aVAnd it's so simple.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VIt's so simple that a computer could do it.
p205
aVAnd you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
p206
aVBut computers \u2014 you need to be able to describe things
p207
aVin very basic terms, and with this, we could.
p208
aVSo I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago
p209
aVcalled TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
p210
aVIt's free. It runs on all the major platforms \u2014 even Windows.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd you just draw a stick figure,
p215
aVand it calculates the crease pattern.
p216
aVIt does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,
p217
aVand if you use that stick figure that I just showed \u2014
p218
aVwhich you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers \u2014
p219
aVyou'll get this crease pattern.
p220
aVAnd if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,
p221
aVyou'll get a base that you can then shape
p222
aVinto a deer,
p223
aVwith exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.
p224
aVAnd if you want a different deer,
p225
aVnot a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,
p226
aVyou change the packing,
p227
aVand you can do an elk.
p228
aVOr you could do a moose.
p229
aVOr, really, any other kind of deer.
p230
aVThese techniques revolutionized this art.
p231
aVWe found we could do insects,
p232
aVspiders, which are close,
p233
aVthings with legs, things with legs and wings,
p234
aVthings with legs and antennae.
p235
aVAnd if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square
p236
aVwasn't interesting enough,
p237
aVthen you could do two praying mantises
p238
aVfrom a single uncut square.
p239
aVShe's eating him.
p240
aVI call it "Snack Time."
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd you can do more than just insects.
p243
aVThis \u2014 you can put details,
p244
aVtoes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.
p245
aVThis tree frog has toes.
p246
aVActually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.
p247
aVToes have become an origami meme,
p248
aVbecause everyone's doing it.
p249
aVYou can make multiple subjects.
p250
aVSo these are a couple of instrumentalists.
p251
aVThe guitar player from a single square,
p252
aVthe bass player from a single square.
p253
aVAnd if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass \u2014
p254
aVthat's not so hot.
p255
aVDo a little more complicated instrument."
p256
aVWell, then you could do an organ.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd what this has allowed is the creation
p261
aVof origami-on-demand.
p262
aVSo now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"
p263
aVand you can go out and fold it.
p264
aVAnd sometimes you create high art,
p265
aVand sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
p266
aVBut I want to show you some examples.
p267
aVEverything you'll see here,
p268
aVexcept the car, is origami.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Video)
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VJust to show you, this really was folded paper.
p275
aVComputers made things move,
p276
aVbut these were all real, folded objects that we made.
p277
aVAnd we can use this not just for visuals,
p278
aVbut it turns out to be useful even in the real world.
p279
aVSurprisingly, origami
p280
aVand the structures that we've developed in origami
p281
aVturn out to have applications in medicine, in science,
p282
aVin space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd I want to show you some of these examples.
p285
aVOne of the earliest was this pattern,
p286
aVthis folded pattern,
p287
aVstudied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
p288
aVHe studied a folding pattern, and realized
p289
aVthis could fold down into an extremely compact package
p290
aVthat had a very simple opening and closing structure.
p291
aVAnd he used it to design this solar array.
p292
aVIt's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope
p293
aVin 1995.
p294
aVNow, there is actually a little origami
p295
aVin the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.
p296
aVThe telescope, going up in space,
p297
aVit unfolds in two places.
p298
aVIt folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern \u2014
p299
aVyou wouldn't even call that origami.
p300
aVThey certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
p301
aa(lp302
VBut if you want to go higher and go larger than this,
p303
aVthen you might need some origami.
p304
aVEngineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
p305
aVhad an idea for a telescope much larger.
p306
aVThey called it the Eyeglass.
p307
aVThe design called for geosynchronous orbit
p308
aV25,000 miles up,
p309
aV100-meter diameter lens.
p310
aVSo, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
p311
aVThere were two groups of people who were interested in this:
p312
aVplanetary scientists, who want to look up,
p313
aVand then other people, who wanted to look down.
p314
aVWhether you look up or look down,
p315
aVhow do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
p316
aVAnd rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.
p317
aVHow do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
p318
aVWell, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
p319
aVSo you have to do something like this.
p320
aVThis was a small model.
p321
aa(lp322
VFolded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.
p323
aVBut this pattern's not going to work
p324
aVto get something 100 meters down to a few meters.
p325
aVSo the Livermore engineers,
p326
aVwanting to make use of the work of dead people,
p327
aVor perhaps live origamists, said,
p328
aV"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."
p329
aVSo they looked into the origami community,
p330
aVwe got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
p331
aVAnd we developed a pattern together
p332
aVthat scales to arbitrarily large size,
p333
aVbut that allows any flat ring or disc
p334
aVto fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.
p335
aVAnd they adopted that for their first generation,
p336
aVwhich was not 100 meters \u2014 it was a five-meter.
p337
aVBut this is a five-meter telescope \u2014
p338
aVhas about a quarter-mile focal length.
p339
aVAnd it works perfectly on its test range,
p340
aVand it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, there is other origami in space.
p343
aVJapan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,
p344
aVand you can see here that the sail expands out,
p345
aVand you can still see the fold lines.
p346
aVThe problem that's being solved here is
p347
aVsomething that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,
p348
aVbut needs to be small for the journey.
p349
aVAnd that works whether you're going into space,
p350
aVor whether you're just going into a body.
p351
aVAnd this example is the latter.
p352
aVThis is a heart stent developed by Zhong You
p353
aVat Oxford University.
p354
aVIt holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,
p355
aVbut it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,
p356
aVthrough your blood vessels.
p357
aVAnd this stent folds down using an origami pattern,
p358
aVbased on a model called the water bomb base.
p359
aa(lp360
VAirbag designers also have the problem
p361
aVof getting flat sheets
p362
aVinto a small space.
p363
aVAnd they want to do their design by simulation.
p364
aVSo they need to figure out how, in a computer,
p365
aVto flatten an airbag.
p366
aVAnd the algorithms that we developed
p367
aVto do insects
p368
aVturned out to be the solution for airbags
p369
aVto do their simulation.
p370
aVAnd so they can do a simulation like this.
p371
aVThose are the origami creases forming,
p372
aVand now you can see the airbag inflate
p373
aVand find out, does it work?
p374
aVAnd that leads
p375
aVto a really interesting idea.
p376
aa(lp377
VYou know, where did these things come from?
p378
aVWell, the heart stent
p379
aVcame from that little blow-up box
p380
aVthat you might have learned in elementary school.
p381
aVIt's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.
p382
aVThe airbag-flattening algorithm
p383
aVcame from all the developments
p384
aVof circle packing and the mathematical theory
p385
aVthat was really developed
p386
aVjust to create insects \u2014 things with legs.
p387
aVThe thing is, that this often happens
p388
aVin math and science.
p389
aVWhen you get math involved, problems that you solve
p390
aVfor aesthetic value only,
p391
aVor to create something beautiful,
p392
aVturn around and turn out
p393
aVto have an application in the real world.
p394
aVAnd as weird and surprising as it may sound,
p395
aVorigami may someday even save a life.
p396
aVThanks.
