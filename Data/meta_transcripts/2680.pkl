V"You have cancer."
p4
aVSadly, about 40 percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime,
p5
aVand half will not survive.
p6
aVThis means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives
p7
aVwill be diagnosed with some form of cancer,
p8
aVand one will die.
p9
aVBeyond the physical hardships,
p10
aVroughly one-third of cancer survivors here in the US
p11
aVwill go into debt from treatment.
p12
aVAnd they're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy
p13
aVthan those without cancer.
p14
aVThis disease is pervasive.
p15
aVIt's emotionally draining
p16
aVand, for many,
p17
aVfinancially destructive.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.
p20
aVFinding cancer early,
p21
aVcloser its genesis,
p22
aVis one of the critical factors to improving treatment options,
p23
aVreducing its emotional impact
p24
aVand minimizing financial burdens.
p25
aVMost importantly,
p26
aVfinding cancer early \u2014
p27
aVwhich is one of the primary aims of my research \u2014
p28
aVgreatly enhances your odds of survival.
p29
aVIf we just look at the case of breast cancer for example,
p30
aVwe find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one
p31
aVhave a five-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent \u2014
p32
aVodds that decrease to just 22 percent if treated at stage four.
p33
aVAnd similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, we're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate
p36
aVis critical for survival.
p37
aVThe problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive,
p38
aVcostly,
p39
aVoften inaccurate
p40
aVand they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results back.
p41
aVStill worse, when it comes to some forms of cancer,
p42
aVsuch as ovarian, liver or pancreatic cancer,
p43
aVgood screening methods simply don't exist,
p44
aVmeaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface,
p45
aVwhich are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression.
p46
aVLike a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system,
p47
aVthere is no alarm to warn,
p48
aVfor the danger is already at your doorstep
p49
aVwhen your odds of survival are greatly reduced.
p50
aVHaving the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options
p51
aVthat are affordable, noninvasive and could provide results much sooner,
p52
aVwould provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer.
p53
aa(lp54
VAn early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease
p55
aVinstead of merely following in its relentless wake.
p56
aVAnd this is exactly what I've been doing.
p57
aVFor the past three years, I've been developing technologies
p58
aVthat could ultimately aid clinicians
p59
aVwith rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics.
p60
aVAnd I've been fueled by a deep scientific curiosity,
p61
aVand a passion to change these statistics.
p62
aa(lp63
VLast year however,
p64
aVthis fight became much more personal
p65
aVwhen my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.
p66
aVIt was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension
p67
aVto these efforts.
p68
aVI know firsthand how life-altering treatment can be,
p69
aVand I'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc
p70
aVthat cancer can wreak on a family,
p71
aVwhich in our case included our two young daughters.
p72
aVBecause we found it early during a routine mammogram,
p73
aVwe were able to focus primarily on treatment options
p74
aVfor the localized tumor,
p75
aVreaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is.
p76
aVUnlike other forms of cancer,
p77
aVmammograms do offer an early-stage screening option for breast cancer.
p78
aVStill, not everyone has this done,
p79
aVor they may develop breast cancer
p80
aVbefore the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram.
p81
aVSo, there's still a lot of room for improvement,
p82
aVeven for cancers that do have screening options,
p83
aVand, of course, considerable benefits for those that don't.
p84
aa(lp85
VA key challenge then for cancer researchers
p86
aVis to develop methods
p87
aVthat make regular screening for many types of cancers
p88
aVmuch more accessible.
p89
aVImagine a scenario where during your regular checkup,
p90
aVyour doctor can take a simple, noninvasive urine sample,
p91
aVor other liquid biopsy,
p92
aVand present you with the results before you even leave the doctor's office.
p93
aVSuch a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people
p94
aVwho slip through the net of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.
p95
aa(lp96
VMy research team of engineers and biochemists
p97
aVis working on exactly this challenge.
p98
aVWe're working on ways to frequently activate an early-stage cancer alarm
p99
aVby enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy
p100
aVso that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges,
p101
aVand before it can progress beyond its infancy.
p102
aVThe silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles,
p103
aVlittle escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes.
p104
aVExosomes are important biomarkers
p105
aVthat provide an early-warning system for the development of cancer.
p106
aVAnd because they're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid,
p107
aVincluding blood, urine and saliva,
p108
aVthey're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies.
p109
aa(lp110
VThere's just one problem.
p111
aVAn automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers
p112
aVis not currently available.
p113
aVWe've created a technology that we call nano-DLD
p114
aVthat is capable of precisely this:
p115
aVautomated exosome isolation
p116
aVto aid rapid cancer diagnostics.
p117
aVExosomes are the newest early-warning weapon, if you will,
p118
aVto emerge on the liquid biopsy front.
p119
aVAnd they're really, really small.
p120
aVThey measure just 30 to 150 nanometers in diameter.
p121
aVThis is so tiny
p122
aVthat you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell.
p123
aVThat's roughly the difference between a golf ball
p124
aVand a fine grain piece of sand.
p125
aa(lp126
VOnce thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste,
p127
aVit has been found that cells actually communicate
p128
aVby producing and absorbing these exosomes
p129
aVwhich contain surface receptors,
p130
aVproteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin.
p131
aVWhen absorbed by a neighboring cell,
p132
aVexosomes release their contents into the receiving cell,
p133
aVand can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression \u2014
p134
aVsome good,
p135
aVand this is where cancer comes in,
p136
aVsome bad.
p137
aVBecause they are clothed in the material of the mother cell,
p138
aVand contain a sample of its environment,
p139
aVthey provide a genetic snapshot of that cell's health and its origin.
p140
aVAll of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers
p141
aVthat potentially allow physicians
p142
aVto eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level.
p143
aa(lp144
VTo catch cancer early, however,
p145
aVyou have to frequently intercept these messages
p146
aVto determine when cancer-causing troublemakers within your body
p147
aVdecide to start staging a coup,
p148
aVwhich is why regular screening is so critical
p149
aVand why we're developing technologies to make this possible.
p150
aVWhile the first exosome-based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year,
p151
aVthey are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options.
p152
aVIn addition to their recent emergence,
p153
aVanother factor that's limiting their widespread adoption
p154
aVis that currently, no automated exosome isolation system exists
p155
aVto make regular screening economically accessible.
p156
aVThe current gold standard for exosome isolation
p157
aVincludes ultracentrifugation,
p158
aVa process requiring expensive laboratory equipment,
p159
aVa trained lab tech
p160
aVand about 30 hours of time to process a sample.
p161
aVWe've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation
p162
aVfrom a sample such as urine.
p163
aVWe use a chip-based, continuous flow separation technique
p164
aVcalled deterministic lateral displacement.
p165
aVAnd we have done with it
p166
aVwhat the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past 50 years.
p167
aVWe shrunk the dimensions of this technology
p168
aVfrom the micron scale to the true nanoscale.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo how does it work?
p171
aVIn a nutshell,
p172
aVa set of tiny pillars separated by nanoscopic gaps
p173
aVare arranged in such a way
p174
aVthat the system divides the fluid into streamlines,
p175
aVwith the larger cancer-related nanoparticles being separated
p176
aVthrough a process of redirection from the smaller, healthier ones,
p177
aVwhich can in contrast
p178
aVmove around the pillars in a zigzag-type motion
p179
aVin the direction of fluid flow.
p180
aVThe net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations.
p181
aVYou can visualize this separation process
p182
aVsimilar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads,
p183
aVwith one road going into a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,
p184
aVand the other road going around it.
p185
aVHere, smaller cars can go through the tunnel
p186
aVwhile larger trucks, carrying potentially hazardous material,
p187
aVare forced to take the detour route.
p188
aVTraffic is effectively separated by size and contents
p189
aVwithout impeding its flow.
p190
aVAnd this is exactly how our system works on a much, much smaller scale.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe idea here is that the separation process for screening
p193
aVcould be as simple as processing a sample of urine, blood or saliva,
p194
aVwhich is a near-term possibility within the next few years.
p195
aVUltimately, it could be used to isolate and detect target exosomes
p196
aVassociated with a particular type of cancer,
p197
aVsensing and reporting their presence within minutes.
p198
aVThis would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless.
p199
aVBroadly speaking,
p200
aVthe ability to separate and enrich biomarkers
p201
aVwith nanoscale precision in an automated way,
p202
aVopens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer,
p203
aVwith applications ranging from sample preparation to diagnostics,
p204
aVand from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics.
p205
aa(lp206
VEven before my wife's bout with cancer,
p207
aVit was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process \u2014
p208
aVto make regular screening more accessible,
p209
aVsimilar to the way Henry Ford made the automobile accessible
p210
aVto the general population
p211
aVthrough development of the assembly line.
p212
aVAutomation is the key to accessibility.
p213
aVAnd in the spirit of the Hoover dream,
p214
aV"a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage,"
p215
aVwe're developing a technology
p216
aVthat could ultimately place an early-warning cancer detection system
p217
aVin every home.
p218
aVThis would allow every man, woman and child
p219
aVthe opportunity to be regularly tested while they're still healthy,
p220
aVcatching cancer when it first emerges.
p221
aa(lp222
VIt is my hope and dream
p223
aVto help people around the world avoid the high costs \u2014
p224
aVphysical, financial and emotional \u2014
p225
aVfaced by today's cancer patients,
p226
aVhardships that I'm well acquainted with.
p227
aVI'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife's cancer early,
p228
aVher treatment was successful,
p229
aVand she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VIt is an outcome that I would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.
p234
aVWith the work that my team has already done
p235
aVon separation of nanoscale biomarkers
p236
aVfor rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,
p237
aVI am optimistic that within the next decade,
p238
aVthis type of technology will be available,
p239
aVhelping protect our friends, our family and future generations.
p240
aVEven if we are so unlucky as to be diagnosed with cancer,
p241
aVthat early-stage alarm will provide a strong beacon of hope.
p242
