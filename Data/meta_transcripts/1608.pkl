VTwo years ago, after having served four years
p4
aVin the United States Marine Corps
p5
aVand deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,
p6
aVI found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team
p7
aVof veterans and medical professionals
p8
aVin some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,
p9
aVthree days after the earthquake.
p10
aVWe were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,
p11
aVthe places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,
p12
aVwe realized something. Military veterans
p13
aVare very, very good at disaster response.
p14
aVAnd coming home, my cofounder and I,
p15
aVwe looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.
p16
aVThe first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.
p17
aVIt's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,
p18
aVand it's not using the best people.
p19
aVThe second problem that we became aware of
p20
aVwas a very inadequate veteran reintegration,
p21
aVand this is a topic that is front page news right now
p22
aVas veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,
p23
aVand they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.
p24
aVAnd we sat here and we looked at these two problems,
p25
aVand finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.
p26
aVThese are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?
p27
aa(lp28
VWell, we can use disaster response as an opportunity
p29
aVfor service for the veterans coming home.
p30
aVRecent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want
p31
aVto continue their service when they take off their uniform.
p32
aVAnd we can use veterans to improve disaster response.
p33
aVNow on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,
p34
aVwe responded to the tsunami in Chile,
p35
aVthe floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.
p36
aVBut it was earlier this year, when one of our
p37
aVoriginal members caused us to shift focus in the organization.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.
p40
aVWe served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
p41
aVClay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.
p42
aVEarlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.
p43
aVThis was a tragedy, but it really forced us
p44
aVto refocus what it is that we were doing.
p45
aVYou know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened
p46
aVin Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself
p47
aVbecause of what he lost when he came home.
p48
aVHe lost purpose. He lost his community.
p49
aVAnd perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled
p52
aVfrom this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems \u2014
p53
aVin the initial iteration of our organization,
p54
aVwe were a disaster response organization that was using
p55
aVveteran service. We had a lot of success,
p56
aVand we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.
p57
aVBut after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,
p58
aVnow moving forward, we see ourselves
p59
aVas a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.
p60
aVBecause we think that we can give that purpose
p61
aVand that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.
p62
aVAnd tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later
p63
aVHurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy
p66
aVwho graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.
p67
aVHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
p68
aVThey send him to Iraq.
p69
aVEvery day he leaves the wire with a mission.
p70
aVThat mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.
p71
aVIt's to keep the men around him alive.
p72
aVIt's to pacify the village that he works in.
p73
aVHe's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,
p74
aVmaybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,
p75
aVbut he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.
p76
aVYou give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri
p77
aVafter a tornado, he regains that.
p78
aa(lp79
VGoing back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school
p80
aVin Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,
p81
aVthe Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.
p82
aVEvery day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.
p83
aVHe leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.
p84
aVHe's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.
p85
aVThey've eaten together. They've bled together.
p86
aVHe goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.
p87
aVHe gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.
p88
aVHe doesn't have that community anymore.
p89
aVBut you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,
p90
aVthey get that sense of community back.
p91
aa(lp92
VAgain, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates
p93
aVhigh school in Kansas City.
p94
aVHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
p95
aVThey send him to Iraq.
p96
aVThey pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.
p97
aVHe takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones
p98
aVin his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.
p99
aVHe doesn't have that same self-worth.
p100
aVBut you send him to Joplin after a tornado,
p101
aVand somebody once again is walking up to him
p102
aVand shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,
p103
aVnow they have self-worth again.
p104
aa(lp105
VI think it's very important, because right now
p106
aVsomebody needs to step up,
p107
aVand this generation of veterans has the opportunity
p108
aVto do that if they are given the chance.
p109
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
