VI've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,
p4
aVand so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with
p5
aVis how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
p6
aVSo often, we look at dollar terms \u2014
p7
aVpeople making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
p8
aVAnd yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at
p9
aVincome as only one variable.
p10
aVBecause really, it's a condition about choice,
p11
aVand the lack of freedom.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me
p14
aVthe understanding that I have.
p15
aVIt was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
p16
aVI was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,
p17
aVin the Mathare Valley slums.
p18
aVNow, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.
p19
aVIt's about three miles out of Nairobi,
p20
aVand it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,
p21
aVwhere over half a million people
p22
aVlive crammed in these little tin shacks,
p23
aVgeneration after generation, renting them,
p24
aVoften eight or 10 people to a room.
p25
aVAnd it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:
p26
aVa hard place to grow up.
p27
aVAnd when we were walking through the narrow alleys,
p28
aVit was literally impossible not to step in the
p29
aVraw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
p30
aVBut at the same time it was also
p31
aVimpossible not to see the human vitality,
p32
aVthe aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:
p33
aVwomen washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.
p34
aVI met this woman, Mama Rose,
p35
aVwho has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,
p36
aVwhere she lives with her seven children.
p37
aVFour sleep in one twin bed,
p38
aVand three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.
p39
aVAnd she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,
p40
aVand from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.
p41
aa(lp42
VIt was also the day after the inauguration,
p43
aVand I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.
p44
aVAnd I would see kids on the street corners,
p45
aVand they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"
p46
aVAnd I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."
p47
aVAnd they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd it was here that I met Jane.
p50
aVI was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,
p51
aVand I asked her to tell me her story.
p52
aVShe started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.
p53
aVMy first dream was to be a doctor,
p54
aVand the second was to marry a good man
p55
aVwho would stay with me and my family,
p56
aVbecause my mother was a single mom,
p57
aVand couldn't afford to pay for school fees.
p58
aVSo I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."
p59
aVShe got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.
p60
aVAnd when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,
p61
aVher mom died and her husband left her \u2014 married another woman.
p62
aVSo she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
p63
aVAnd so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
p64
aVIt wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.
p65
aVShe would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,
p66
aVlook for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,
p67
aVor sometimes with nothing.
p68
aVAnd she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation
p69
aVand the embarrassment of it all."
p70
aa(lp71
VIn 2001, her life changed.
p72
aVShe had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,
p73
aVthat would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,
p74
aVas long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
p75
aVAnd so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,
p76
aVand started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.
p77
aVShe started tailoring.
p78
aVAnd that turned into what she does now,
p79
aVwhich is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,
p80
aVand for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.
p81
aVSome of them might be ones you gave.
p82
aVAnd she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,
p83
aVand makes these frothy confections that she sells to women
p84
aVfor their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion \u2014
p85
aVthose milestones in a life that people want to celebrate
p86
aVall along the economic spectrum.
p87
aVAnd she does really good business. In fact, I watched her
p88
aVwalk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,
p89
aVthere was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,
p92
aVand also the jewelry that she makes,
p93
aVthat now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.
p94
aVAnd by many definitions she is no longer poor.
p95
aVBut she still lives in Mathare Valley.
p96
aVAnd so she can't move out.
p97
aVShe lives with all of that insecurity,
p98
aVand in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,
p99
aVshe was chased from her home and had to find a new shack
p100
aVin which she would live.
p101
aa(lp102
VJamii Bora understands that and understands
p103
aVthat when we're talking about poverty,
p104
aVwe've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
p105
aVAnd so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,
p106
aVloans and investments that will go the long term with them,
p107
aVthey built a low-cost housing development,
p108
aVabout an hour outside Nairobi central.
p109
aVAnd they designed it from the perspective of
p110
aVcustomers like Jane herself,
p111
aVinsisting on responsibility and accountability.
p112
aVSo she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage \u2014
p113
aVof the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.
p114
aVAnd then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
p115
aVAnd in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be
p116
aVamong the first 200 families to move into this development.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhen I asked her if she feared anything,
p119
aVor whether she would miss anything from Mathare,
p120
aVshe said, "What would I fear
p121
aVthat I haven't confronted already?
p122
aVI'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
p123
aVAnd she said, "What would I miss?
p124
aVYou think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?
p125
aVDo you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home
p126
aVat the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes
p127
aVmy bags would be packed."
p128
aVI said, "Well what about your dreams?"
p129
aVAnd she said, "Well, you know,
p130
aVmy dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
p131
aVBut if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,
p132
aVbut what I really wanted was a family
p133
aVthat was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."
p134
aVShe said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,
p135
aVbut what I really wanted to be was somebody
p136
aVwho served and healed and cured.
p137
aVAnd so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,
p138
aVthat two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.
p139
aVAnd I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
p140
aVYou are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"
p141
aVAnd she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.
p142
aVBut maybe me, I give out something better
p143
aVbecause I give them hope."
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd in the middle of this economic crisis,
p146
aVwhere so many of us are inclined to pull in
p147
aVwith fear, I think we're well suited to
p148
aVtake a cue from Jane and reach out,
p149
aVrecognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
p150
aVBecause when systems are broken,
p151
aVlike the ones that we're seeing around the world,
p152
aVit's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
p153
aVIt's an opportunity to truly build a world
p154
aVwhere we can extend services and products
p155
aVto all human beings, so that they can
p156
aVmake decisions and choices for themselves.
p157
aVI truly believe it's where dignity starts.
p158
aVWe owe it to the Janes of the world.
p159
aVAnd just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
p160
