V[On April 3, 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history.]
p4
aV[The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people]
p5
aV[hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts.]
p6
aV[What does this mean?]
p7
aV[We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain.]
p8
aa(lp9
VThis week, there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories
p10
aVcoming out from the leak of 11 million documents
p11
aVfrom a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca.
p12
aVThe release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece
p13
aVof the secretive offshore world.
p14
aVWe get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers
p15
aVgo to companies like Mossack Fonseca
p16
aVand say, "OK, we want an anonymous company,
p17
aVcan you give us one?"
p18
aVSo you actually get to see the emails,
p19
aVyou get to see the exchanges of messages,
p20
aVyou get to see the mechanics of how this works,
p21
aVhow this operates.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions.
p24
aVThe Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.
p25
aVWe've also had news
p26
aVthat an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad
p27
aVhas also got offshore companies.
p28
aVThere's been allegations of a $2 billion money trail
p29
aVthat leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia
p30
aVvia his close childhood friend,
p31
aVwho happens to be a top cellist.
p32
aVAnd there will be a lot of rich individuals out there
p33
aVand others who will be nervous about the next set of stories
p34
aVand the next set of leaked documents.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller
p37
aVor a John Grisham novel.
p38
aVIt seems very distant from you, me, ordinary people.
p39
aVWhy should we care about this?
p40
aVBut the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals
p41
aVare able to keep their money offshore
p42
aVand not pay the taxes that they should,
p43
aVit means that there is less money for vital public services
p44
aVlike healthcare, education, roads.
p45
aVAnd that affects all of us.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, for my organization Global Witness,
p48
aVthis exposé has been phenomenal.
p49
aVWe have the world's media and political leaders
p50
aVtalking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy
p51
aVto hide and disguise their assets \u2014
p52
aVsomething we have been talking about and exposing for a decade.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing,
p55
aVand hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works.
p56
aVI like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll.
p57
aVSo you can have one company stacked inside another company,
p58
aVstacked inside another company,
p59
aVmaking it almost impossible to really understand
p60
aVwho is behind these structures.
p61
aVIt can be very difficult for law enforcement
p62
aVor tax authorities, journalists, civil society
p63
aVto really understand what's going on.
p64
aa(lp65
VI also think it's interesting
p66
aVthat there's been less coverage of this issue in the United States.
p67
aVAnd that's perhaps because some prominent US people
p68
aVjust haven't figured in this exposé, in this scandal.
p69
aVNow, that's not because there are no rich Americans
p70
aVwho are stashing their assets offshore.
p71
aVIt's just because of the way in which offshore works,
p72
aVMossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
p73
aVI think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands
p74
aVor even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada,
p75
aVyou would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn fact, in a number of US states you need less information,
p78
aVyou need to provide less information to get a company
p79
aVthan you do to get a library card.
p80
aVThat sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts
p81
aVto rip off schoolchildren.
p82
aVIt has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors.
p83
aVThis is the sort of behavior that affects all of us.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, at Global Witness,
p86
aVwe wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice.
p87
aVHow does this actually work?
p88
aVSo what we did
p89
aVis we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms.
p90
aVOur investigator posed as an African minister
p91
aVwho wanted to move suspect funds into the United States
p92
aVto buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
p93
aVNow, what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers
p94
aVprovided our investigator with suggestions
p95
aVon how to move those suspect funds.
p96
aVThese were all preliminary meetings,
p97
aVand none of the lawyers took us on as a client
p98
aVand of course no money moved hands,
p99
aVbut it really shows the problem with the system.
p100
aa(lp101
VIt's also important
p102
aVto not just think about this as individual cases.
p103
aVThis is not just about an individual lawyer
p104
aVwho's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions.
p105
aVIt's not just about a particular senior politician
p106
aVwho's been caught up in a scandal.
p107
aVThis is about how a system works,
p108
aVthat entrenches corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
p109
aVAnd in order to tackle this,
p110
aVwe need to change the game.
p111
aVWe need to change the rules of the game
p112
aVto make this sort of behavior harder.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis may seem like doom and gloom,
p115
aVlike there's nothing we can do about it,
p116
aVlike nothing has ever changed,
p117
aVlike there will always be rich and powerful individuals.
p118
aVBut as a natural optimist,
p119
aVI do see that we are starting to get some change.
p120
aa(lp121
VOver the last couple of years,
p122
aVwe've seen a real push towards greater transparency
p123
aVwhen it comes to company ownership.
p124
aVThis issue was put on the political agenda
p125
aVby the UK Prime Minister David Cameron
p126
aVat a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013.
p127
aVAnd since then, the European Union is going to be creating
p128
aVcentral registers at a national level
p129
aVof who really owns and controls companies across Europe.
p130
aa(lp131
VOne of the things that is sad is that, actually, the US is lagging behind.
p132
aVThere's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced
p133
aVin the House and the Senate,
p134
aVbut it isn't making as much progress as we'd like to see.
p135
aVSo we'd really want to see the Panama leaks,
p136
aVthis huge peek into the offshore world,
p137
aVbe used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world.
p138
aa(lp139
VFor us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
p140
aVWe need ordinary people to get angry
p141
aVat the way in which people can hide their identity
p142
aVbehind secret companies.
p143
aVWe need business leaders to stand up and say,
p144
aV"Secrecy like this is not good for business."
p145
aVWe need political leaders to recognize the problem,
p146
aVand to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy.
p147
aa(lp148
VTogether, we can end the secrecy
p149
aVthat is currently allowing tax evasion,
p150
aVcorruption, money laundering to flourish.
