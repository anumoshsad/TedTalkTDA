VExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,
p4
aVand it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer
p5
aVto remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, I want to tell you a story about that.
p8
aVIt involves data from a NASA mission,
p9
aVordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.
p10
aa(lp11
VIt began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission.
p12
aVKepler's main scientific objective
p13
aVwas to find planets outside of our solar system.
p14
aVIt did this by staring at a single field in the sky,
p15
aVthis one, with all the tiny boxes.
p16
aVAnd in this one field,
p17
aVit monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars
p18
aVcontinuously for four years,
p19
aVtaking a data point every 30 minutes.
p20
aVIt was looking for what astronomers call a transit.
p21
aVThis is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight,
p22
aVjust so that the planet crosses in front of a star.
p23
aVAnd when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,
p24
aVwhich you can see as a dip in this curve.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers
p27
aVto search for transits in all the Kepler data.
p28
aa(lp29
VAt the same time of the first data release,
p30
aVastronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing:
p31
aVWhat if computers missed something?
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters
p34
aVto have people look at the same data.
p35
aVThe human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition,
p36
aVsometimes even better than a computer.
p37
aVHowever, there was a lot of skepticism around this.
p38
aVMy colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project,
p39
aVsaid that people at the time were saying,
p40
aV"You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal."
p41
aVAnd so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble.
p42
aVAnd if we found one planet, we would be thrilled.
p43
aVWhen I joined the team four years ago,
p44
aVwe had already found a couple.
p45
aVAnd today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,
p46
aVwe have found dozens,
p47
aVand we've also found one of the most mysterious stars
p48
aVin our galaxy.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo to understand this,
p51
aVlet me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like.
p52
aVOn this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light,
p53
aVand on the bottom is time.
p54
aVThe white line is light just from the star,
p55
aVwhat astronomers call a light curve.
p56
aVNow, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light,
p57
aVand the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself.
p58
aVAnd so, for example, let's take Jupiter.
p59
aVPlanets don't get much bigger than Jupiter.
p60
aVJupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness.
p61
aVEarth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,
p62
aVand the signal is barely visible in the data.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo back to our mystery.
p65
aVA few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits,
p66
aVand they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852.
p67
aVThe observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted,
p68
aVand they started talking about this in the discussion forums.
p69
aa(lp70
VThey said and object like Jupiter
p71
aVwould make a drop like this in the star's light,
p72
aVbut they were also saying it was giant.
p73
aVYou see, transits normally only last for a few hours,
p74
aVand this one lasted for almost a week.
p75
aa(lp76
VThey were also saying that it looks asymmetric,
p77
aVmeaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,
p78
aVit had this strange slope that you can see on the left side.
p79
aVThis seemed to indicate
p80
aVthat whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight
p81
aVwas not circular like a planet.
p82
aVThere are few more dips that happened,
p83
aVbut for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd then in March of 2011, we see this.
p86
aVThe star's light drops by a whole 15 percent,
p87
aVand this is huge compared to a planet,
p88
aVwhich would only make a one percent drop.
p89
aVWe described this feature as both smooth and clean.
p90
aVIt also is asymmetric,
p91
aVhaving a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week,
p92
aVand then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd again, after this, not much happens
p95
aVuntil February of 2013.
p96
aVThings start to get really crazy.
p97
aVThere is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear,
p98
aVand they last for like a hundred days,
p99
aVall the way up into the Kepler mission's end.
p100
aVThese dips have variable shapes.
p101
aVSome are very sharp, and some are broad,
p102
aVand they also have variable durations.
p103
aVSome last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week.
p104
aVAnd there's also up and down trends within some of these dips,
p105
aValmost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other.
p106
aVAnd at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent.
p107
aVThis means that whatever is blocking its light
p108
aVhas an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is truly remarkable.
p111
aVAnd so the citizen scientists, when they saw this,
p112
aVthey notified the science team that they found something weird enough
p113
aVthat it might be worth following up.
p114
aVAnd so when the science team looked at it,
p115
aVwe're like, "Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data."
p116
aVBut we looked really, really, really hard,
p117
aVand the data were good.
p118
aVAnd so what was happening had to be astrophysical,
p119
aVmeaning that something in space was getting in the way
p120
aVand blocking starlight.
p121
aVAnd so at this point,
p122
aVwe set out to learn everything we could about the star
p123
aVto see if we could find any clues to what was going on.
p124
aVAnd the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery,
p125
aVthey joined along for the ride
p126
aVwatching science in action firsthand.
p127
aa(lp128
VFirst, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young
p129
aVand it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it.
p130
aVAnd then somebody else said,
p131
aVwell, what if the star had already formed planets,
p132
aVand two of these planets had collided,
p133
aVsimilar to the Earth-Moon forming event.
p134
aVWell, both of these theories could explain part of the data,
p135
aVbut the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young,
p136
aVand there was no glow from any of the material
p137
aVthat was heated up by the star's light,
p138
aVand you would expect this if the star was young
p139
aVor if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced.
p140
aVAnd so somebody else said,
p141
aVwell, how about a huge swarm of comets
p142
aVthat are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit?
p143
aVWell, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations.
p144
aVBut I agree, it does feel a little contrived.
p145
aVYou see, it would take hundreds of comets
p146
aVto reproduce what we're observing.
p147
aVAnd these are only the comets
p148
aVthat happen to pass between us and the star.
p149
aVAnd so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets.
p150
aVBut of all the bad ideas we had,
p151
aVthis one was the best.
p152
aVAnd so we went ahead and published our findings.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote.
p155
aVScientists are meant to publish results,
p156
aVand this situation was far from that.
p157
aVAnd so we decided to give it a catchy title,
p158
aVand we called it: "Where's The Flux?"
p159
aVI will let you work out the acronym.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VSo this isn't the end of the story.
p164
aVAround the same time I was writing this paper,
p165
aVI met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright,
p166
aVand he was also writing a paper on Kepler data.
p167
aVAnd he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision,
p168
aVit could actually detect alien megastructures around stars,
p169
aVbut it didn't.
p170
aVAnd then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found,
p171
aVand he said to me,
p172
aV"Aw crap, Tabby.
p173
aVNow I have to rewrite my paper."
p174
aa(lp175
VSo yes, the natural explanations were weak,
p176
aVand we were curious now.
p177
aVSo we had to find a way to rule out aliens.
p178
aVSo together, we convinced a colleague of ours
p179
aVwho works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
p180
aVthat this would be an extraordinary target to pursue.
p181
aVWe wrote a proposal to observe the star
p182
aVwith the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.
p183
aa(lp184
VA couple months later,
p185
aVnews of this proposal got leaked to the press
p186
aVand now there are thousands of articles,
p187
aVover 10,000 articles, on this star alone.
p188
aVAnd if you search Google Images,
p189
aVthis is what you'll find.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well,
p192
aVhow do aliens actually explain this light curve?
p193
aVOK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own.
p194
aVIn this hypothetical circumstance,
p195
aVthis civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet,
p196
aVso where could they get more energy?
p197
aVWell, they have a host star just like we have a sun,
p198
aVand so if they were able to capture more energy from this star,
p199
aVthen that would solve their energy needs.
p200
aVSo they would go and build huge structures.
p201
aVThese giant megastructures,
p202
aVlike ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis image above
p205
aVare lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres.
p206
aVIt's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things,
p207
aVbut you can think of it this way.
p208
aVThe Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles.
p209
aVThe simplest element on one of these structures
p210
aVis 100 times that size.
p211
aVThey're enormous.
p212
aVAnd now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star.
p213
aVYou can see how it would produce anomalies in the data
p214
aVsuch as uneven, unnatural looking dips.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut it remains that even alien megastructures
p217
aVcannot defy the laws of physics.
p218
aVYou see, anything that uses a lot of energy
p219
aVis going to produce heat,
p220
aVand we don't observe this.
p221
aVBut it could be something as simple
p222
aVas they're just reradiating it away in another direction,
p223
aVjust not at Earth.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnother idea that's one of my personal favorites
p226
aVis that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle
p227
aVand the catastrophic destruction of a planet.
p228
aVNow, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust
p229
aVthat we don't observe.
p230
aVBut if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation,
p231
aVthen who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess
p232
aVfor recycling purposes?
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VYou can see how this quickly captures your imagination.
p237
aa(lp238
VWell, there you have it.
p239
aVWe're in a situation that could unfold
p240
aVto be a natural phenomenon we don't understand
p241
aVor an alien technology we don't understand.
p242
aVPersonally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation.
p243
aVBut don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens.
p244
aVEither way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo what happens next?
p247
aVWe need to continue to observe this star
p248
aVto learn more about what's happening.
p249
aVBut professional astronomers, like me,
p250
aVwe have limited resources for this kind of thing,
p251
aVand Kepler is on to a different mission.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd I'm happy to say that once again,
p254
aVcitizen scientists have come in and saved the day.
p255
aVYou see, this time,
p256
aVamateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes
p257
aVstepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly
p258
aVat their own facilities,
p259
aVand I am so excited to see what they find.
p260
aa(lp261
VWhat's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers
p262
aVbecause we just weren't looking for something like this.
p263
aVAnd what's more exciting
p264
aVis that there's more data to come.
p265
aVThere are new missions that are coming up
p266
aVthat are observing millions more stars
p267
aVall over the sky.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this?
p270
aVAnd what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.
