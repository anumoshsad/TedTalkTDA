VFive hundred seventy-one million
p4
aVtwo hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels
p5
aVare used by Americans
p6
aVevery year.
p7
aVIf we could \u2014 correction, wrong figure \u2014
p8
aV13 billion used every year.
p9
aVIf we could reduce the usage of paper towels,
p10
aVone paper towel per person per day,
p11
aV571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.
p12
aVWe can do that.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.
p15
aVThere's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.
p16
aVThere's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.
p17
aVPeople go one, two, three, four, tear.
p18
aVThis much, right?
p19
aVThere's the one that cuts itself.
p20
aVPeople go, one, two, three, four.
p21
aVOr there's the same thing, but recycled paper,
p22
aVyou have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe fact is, you can do it all with one towel.
p25
aVThe key, two words:
p26
aVThis half of the room, your word is "shake."
p27
aVLet's hear it. Shake. Louder.
p28
aa(lp29
VAudience: Shake.
p30
aa(lp31
VJoe Smith: Your word is "fold."
p32
aa(lp33
VAudience: Fold.
p34
aa(lp35
VJS: Again.
p36
aa(lp37
VAudience: Fold. JS: Really loud.
p38
aa(lp39
VAudience: Shake. Fold.
p40
aa(lp41
VJS: OK. Wet hands.
p42
aVShake \u2014 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
p43
aVWhy 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,
p44
aVtwelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:
p45
aVIt's the biggest number with one syllable.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VTri-fold. Fold ...
p50
aVDry.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VAudience: Shake.
p55
aa(lp56
VFold.
p57
aa(lp58
VJS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important
p59
aVbecause it allows interstitial suspension.
p60
aVYou don't have to remember that part, but trust me.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAudience: Shake. Fold.
p65
aa(lp66
VJS: Cuts itself.
p67
aVYou know the funny thing is,
p68
aVI get my hands drier than people do with three or four,
p69
aVbecause they can't get in between the cracks.
p70
aVIf you think this isn't as good...
p71
aa(lp72
VAudience: Shake. Fold.
p73
aa(lp74
VJS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,
p75
aVit's the one where you wave your hand
p76
aVand it kicks it out.
p77
aVIt's way too big a towel.
p78
aVLet me tell you a secret.
p79
aVIf you're really quick, if you're really quick \u2014
p80
aVand I can prove this \u2014
p81
aVthis is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.
p82
aVHow? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.
p83
aVIt's smart enough to stop.
p84
aVAnd you get half a towel.
p85
aa(lp86
VAudience: Shake. Fold.
p87
aa(lp88
VJS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.
p89
aVYou will for the rest of your life remember those words
p90
aVevery time you pick up a paper towel.
p91
aVAnd remember, one towel per person for one year \u2014
p92
aV571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.
p93
aVAnd next year, toilet paper.
