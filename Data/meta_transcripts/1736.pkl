VGrowing up in Taiwan
p4
aVas the daughter of a calligrapher,
p5
aVone of my most treasured memories
p6
aVwas my mother showing me the beauty, the shape
p7
aVand the form of Chinese characters.
p8
aVEver since then, I was fascinated
p9
aVby this incredible language.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut to an outsider, it seems to be
p12
aVas impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
p13
aVOver the past few years, I've been wondering
p14
aVif I can break down this wall,
p15
aVso anyone who wants to understand and appreciate
p16
aVthe beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
p17
aVI started thinking about how a new, fast method
p18
aVof learning Chinese might be useful.
p19
aa(lp20
VSince the age of five, I started to learn how to draw
p21
aVevery single stroke for each character
p22
aVin the correct sequence.
p23
aVI learned new characters every day
p24
aVduring the course of the next 15 years.
p25
aVSince we only have five minutes,
p26
aVit's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
p27
aVA Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
p28
aVYou only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
p29
aVThe top 200 will allow you to comprehend
p30
aV40 percent of basic literature \u2014
p31
aVenough to read road signs, restaurant menus,
p32
aVto understand the basic idea of the web pages
p33
aVor the newspapers.
p34
aVToday I'm going to start with eight
p35
aVto show you how the method works.
p36
aVYou are ready?
p37
aa(lp38
VOpen your mouth as wide as possible
p39
aVuntil it's square.
p40
aVYou get a mouth.
p41
aVThis is a person going for a walk.
p42
aVPerson.
p43
aVIf the shape of the fire is a person
p44
aVwith two arms on both sides,
p45
aVas if she was yelling frantically,
p46
aV"Help! I'm on fire!" \u2014
p47
aVThis symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,
p48
aVbut I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.
p49
aVThis is a tree.
p50
aVTree.
p51
aVThis is a mountain.
p52
aVThe sun.
p53
aVThe moon.
p54
aVThe symbol of the door
p55
aVlooks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.
p56
aa(lp57
VI call these eight characters radicals.
p58
aVThey are the building blocks
p59
aVfor you to create lots more characters.
p60
aVA person.
p61
aVIf someone walks behind, that is "to follow."
p62
aVAs the old saying goes,
p63
aVtwo is company, three is a crowd.
p64
aVIf a person stretched their arms wide,
p65
aVthis person is saying, "It was this big."
p66
aVThe person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
p67
aVHe's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
p68
aVOne tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.
p69
aVThree trees together, we create the forest.
p70
aVPut a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
p71
aVPut a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter)
p72
aVEasy to remember,
p73
aVsince a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
p74
aVRemember fire?
p75
aVTwo fires together, I get really hot.
p76
aVThree fires together, that's a lot of flames.
p77
aVSet the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
p78
aVFor us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
p79
aVTwo suns together, prosperous.
p80
aVThree together, that's sparkles.
p81
aVPut the sun and the moon shining together,
p82
aVit's brightness.
p83
aVIt also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
p84
aVThe sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.
p85
aVA door. Put a plank inside the door,
p86
aVit's a door bolt.
p87
aVPut a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
p88
aVKnock knock. Is anyone home?
p89
aVThis person is sneaking out of a door,
p90
aVescaping, evading.
p91
aVOn the left, we have a woman.
p92
aVTwo women together, they have an argument.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVThree women together, be careful, it's adultery.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo we have gone through almost 30 characters.
p97
aVBy using this method, the first eight radicals
p98
aVwill allow you to build 32.
p99
aVThe next group of eight characters
p100
aVwill build an extra 32.
p101
aVSo with very little effort,
p102
aVyou will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,
p103
aVwhich is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
p104
aVSo after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
p105
aVFor example, the mountain and the fire together,
p106
aVwe have fire mountain. It's a volcano.
p107
aVWe know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
p108
aVThis is a sun placed with the origin,
p109
aVbecause Japan lies to the east of China.
p110
aVSo a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
p111
aVA person behind Japan, what do we get?
p112
aVA Japanese person.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe character on the left is two mountains
p115
aVstacked on top of each other.
p116
aVIn ancient China, that means in exile,
p117
aVbecause Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies
p118
aVin exile beyond mountains.
p119
aVNowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
p120
aVA mouth which tells you where to get out
p121
aVis an exit.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking
p124
aVand get off of the stage. Thank you.
