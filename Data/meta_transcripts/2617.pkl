VJune 2010.
p4
aVI landed for the first time in Rome, Italy.
p5
aVI wasn't there to sightsee.
p6
aVI was there to solve world hunger.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VThat's right.
p11
aVI was a 25-year-old PhD student
p12
aVarmed with a prototype tool developed back at my university,
p13
aVand I was going to help the World Food Programme fix hunger.
p14
aVSo I strode into the headquarters building
p15
aVand my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,
p16
aVand I smiled as I thought to myself,
p17
aV"The engineer is here."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VGive me your data.
p22
aVI'm going to optimize everything.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VTell me the food that you've purchased,
p27
aVtell me where it's going and when it needs to be there,
p28
aVand I'm going to tell you the shortest, fastest, cheapest,
p29
aVbest set of routes to take for the food.
p30
aVWe're going to save money,
p31
aVwe're going to avoid delays and disruptions,
p32
aVand bottom line, we're going to save lives.
p33
aVYou're welcome.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VI thought it was going to take 12 months,
p38
aVOK, maybe even 13.
p39
aVThis is not quite how it panned out.
p40
aVJust a couple of months into the project, my French boss, he told me,
p41
aV"You know, Mallory,
p42
aVit's a good idea,
p43
aVbut the data you need for your algorithms is not there.
p44
aVIt's the right idea but at the wrong time,
p45
aVand the right idea at the wrong time
p46
aVis the wrong idea."
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VProject over.
p51
aVI was crushed.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhen I look back now
p54
aVon that first summer in Rome
p55
aVand I see how much has changed over the past six years,
p56
aVit is an absolute transformation.
p57
aVIt's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world.
p58
aVIt's exciting. It's inspiring.
p59
aVBut we're not there yet.
p60
aVAnd brace yourself, executives,
p61
aVbecause I'm going to be putting companies
p62
aVon the hot seat to step up and play the role that I know they can.
p63
aa(lp64
VMy experiences back in Rome prove
p65
aVusing data you can save lives.
p66
aVOK, not that first attempt,
p67
aVbut eventually we got there.
p68
aVLet me paint the picture for you.
p69
aVImagine that you have to plan breakfast, lunch and dinner
p70
aVfor 500,000 people,
p71
aVand you only have a certain budget to do it,
p72
aVsay 6.5 million dollars per month.
p73
aVWell, what should you do? What's the best way to handle it?
p74
aVShould you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?
p75
aVHow much?
p76
aVIt sounds simple. It's not.
p77
aVYou have 30 possible foods, and you have to pick five of them.
p78
aVThat's already over 140,000 different combinations.
p79
aVThen for each food that you pick,
p80
aVyou need to decide how much you'll buy,
p81
aVwhere you're going to get it from,
p82
aVwhere you're going to store it,
p83
aVhow long it's going to take to get there.
p84
aVYou need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well.
p85
aVAnd that's already over 900 million options.
p86
aVIf you considered each option for a single second,
p87
aVthat would take you over 28 years to get through.
p88
aV900 million options.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers
p91
aVto weed through all 900 million options
p92
aVin just a matter of days.
p93
aVIt turned out to be incredibly successful.
p94
aVIn an operation in Iraq,
p95
aVwe saved 17 percent of the costs,
p96
aVand this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional 80,000 people.
p97
aVIt's all thanks to the use of data and modeling complex systems.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut we didn't do it alone.
p100
aVThe unit that I worked with in Rome, they were unique.
p101
aVThey believed in collaboration.
p102
aVThey brought in the academic world.
p103
aVThey brought in companies.
p104
aVAnd if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger,
p105
aVwe need everybody to the table.
p106
aVWe need the data people from humanitarian organizations
p107
aVleading the way,
p108
aVand orchestrating just the right types of engagements
p109
aVwith academics, with governments.
p110
aVAnd there's one group that's not being leveraged in the way that it should be.
p111
aVDid you guess it? Companies.
p112
aa(lp113
VCompanies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world.
p114
aVI've been in the private sector for two years now.
p115
aVI've seen what companies can do, and I've seen what companies aren't doing,
p116
aVand I think there's three main ways that we can fill that gap:
p117
aVby donating data, by donating decision scientists
p118
aVand by donating technology to gather new sources of data.
p119
aVThis is data philanthropy,
p120
aVand it's the future of corporate social responsibility.
p121
aVBonus, it also makes good business sense.
p122
aa(lp123
VCompanies today, they collect mountains of data,
p124
aVso the first thing they can do is start donating that data.
p125
aVSome companies are already doing it.
p126
aVTake, for example, a major telecom company.
p127
aVThey opened up their data in Senegal and the Ivory Coast
p128
aVand researchers discovered
p129
aVthat if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers,
p130
aVyou can see where people are traveling.
p131
aVAnd that can tell you things like
p132
aVwhere malaria might spread, and you can make predictions with it.
p133
aVOr take for example an innovative satellite company.
p134
aVThey opened up their data and donated it,
p135
aVand with that data you could track
p136
aVhow droughts are impacting food production.
p137
aVWith that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis is a great start.
p140
aVThere's important insights just locked away in company data.
p141
aVAnd yes, you need to be very careful.
p142
aVYou need to respect privacy concerns, for example by anonymizing the data.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut even if the floodgates opened up,
p145
aVand even if all companies donated their data
p146
aVto academics, to NGOs, to humanitarian organizations,
p147
aVit wouldn't be enough to harness that full impact of data
p148
aVfor humanitarian goals.
p149
aVWhy?
p150
aVTo unlock insights in data, you need decision scientists.
p151
aVDecision scientists are people like me.
p152
aVThey take the data, they clean it up,
p153
aVtransform it and put it into a useful algorithm
p154
aVthat's the best choice to address the business need at hand.
p155
aVIn the world of humanitarian aid, there are very few decision scientists.
p156
aVMost of them work for companies.
p157
aVSo that's the second thing that companies need to do.
p158
aVIn addition to donating their data,
p159
aVthey need to donate their decision scientists.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, companies will say, "Ah! Don't take our decision scientists from us.
p162
aVWe need every spare second of their time."
p163
aVBut there's a way.
p164
aVIf a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist's time,
p165
aVit would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time
p166
aVover a long period, say for example five years.
p167
aVThis might only amount to a couple of hours per month,
p168
aVwhich a company would hardly miss,
p169
aVbut what it enables is really important: long-term partnerships.
p170
aVLong-term partnerships allow you to build relationships,
p171
aVto get to know the data, to really understand it
p172
aVand to start to understand the needs and challenges
p173
aVthat the humanitarian organization is facing.
p174
aVIn Rome, at the World Food Programme, this took us five years to do,
p175
aVfive years.
p176
aVThat first three years, OK, that was just what we couldn't solve for.
p177
aVThen there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool,
p178
aVlike in the operations in Iraq and other countries.
p179
aVI don't think that's an unrealistic timeline
p180
aVwhen it comes to using data to make operational changes.
p181
aVIt's an investment. It requires patience.
p182
aVBut the types of results that can be produced are undeniable.
p183
aVIn our case, it was the ability to feed tens of thousands more people.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo we have donating data, we have donating decision scientists,
p186
aVand there's actually a third way that companies can help:
p187
aVdonating technology to capture new sources of data.
p188
aVYou see, there's a lot of things we just don't have data on.
p189
aVRight now, Syrian refugees are flooding into Greece,
p190
aVand the UN refugee agency, they have their hands full.
p191
aVThe current system for tracking people is paper and pencil,
p192
aVand what that means is
p193
aVthat when a mother and her five children walk into the camp,
p194
aVheadquarters is essentially blind to this moment.
p195
aVThat's all going to change in the next few weeks,
p196
aVthanks to private sector collaboration.
p197
aVThere's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology
p198
aVfrom the logistics company that I work for.
p199
aVWith this new system, there will be a data trail,
p200
aVso you know exactly the moment
p201
aVwhen that mother and her children walk into the camp.
p202
aVAnd even more, you know if she's going to have supplies
p203
aVthis month and the next.
p204
aVInformation visibility drives efficiency.
p205
aVFor companies, using technology to gather important data,
p206
aVit's like bread and butter.
p207
aVThey've been doing it for years,
p208
aVand it's led to major operational efficiency improvements.
p209
aVJust try to imagine your favorite beverage company
p210
aVtrying to plan their inventory
p211
aVand not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves.
p212
aVIt's absurd.
p213
aVData drives better decisions.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, if you're representing a company,
p216
aVand you're pragmatic and not just idealistic,
p217
aVyou might be saying to yourself, "OK, this is all great, Mallory,
p218
aVbut why should I want to be involved?"
p219
aVWell for one thing, beyond the good PR,
p220
aVhumanitarian aid is a 24-billion-dollar sector,
p221
aVand there's over five billion people, maybe your next customers,
p222
aVthat live in the developing world.
p223
aVFurther, companies that are engaging in data philanthropy,
p224
aVthey're finding new insights locked away in their data.
p225
aVTake, for example, a credit card company
p226
aVthat's opened up a center
p227
aVthat functions as a hub for academics, for NGOs and governments,
p228
aVall working together.
p229
aVThey're looking at information in credit card swipes
p230
aVand using that to find insights about how households in India
p231
aVlive, work, earn and spend.
p232
aVFor the humanitarian world, this provides information
p233
aVabout how you might bring people out of poverty.
p234
aVBut for companies, it's providing insights about your customers
p235
aVand potential customers in India.
p236
aVIt's a win all around.
p237
aVNow, for me, what I find exciting about data philanthropy \u2014
p238
aVdonating data, donating decision scientists and donating technology \u2014
p239
aVit's what it means for young professionals like me
p240
aVwho are choosing to work at companies.
p241
aVStudies show that the next generation of the workforce
p242
aVcare about having their work make a bigger impact.
p243
aVWe want to make a difference,
p244
aVand so through data philanthropy,
p245
aVcompanies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists.
p246
aVAnd that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand.
p247
aa(lp248
VData philanthropy makes good business sense,
p249
aVand it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world.
p250
aVIf we coordinated the planning and logistics
p251
aVacross all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation,
p252
aVwe could feed, clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people,
p253
aVand companies need to step up and play the role that I know they can
p254
aVin bringing about this revolution.
p255
aa(lp256
VYou've probably heard of the saying "food for thought."
p257
aVWell, this is literally thought for food.
p258
aVIt finally is the right idea at the right time.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VTrès magnifique.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.
