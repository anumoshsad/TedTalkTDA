VI want to talk about the election.
p4
aVFor the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters
p5
aVvoted for an African-American candidate for President.
p6
aVAnd in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
p7
aVHe won 375 electoral votes.
p8
aVAnd he won about 70 million popular votes
p9
aVmore than any other presidential candidate \u2014
p10
aVof any race, of any party \u2014 in history.
p11
aVIf you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier \u2014
p12
aVDemocrats really like seeing this transition here,
p13
aVwhere almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic \u2014
p14
aVeven states Obama lost, like out west,
p15
aVthose states became more blue.
p16
aVIn the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere
p17
aVbut with a couple of exceptions here and there.
p18
aa(lp19
VOne exception is in Massachusetts.
p20
aVThat was John Kerry's home state.
p21
aVNo big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.
p22
aVOr in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,
p23
aVObama didn't have much improvement.
p24
aVBut there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
p25
aVThis kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
p26
aVNow if you look at '96, Bill Clinton \u2014
p27
aVthe last Democrat to actually win \u2014 how he did in '96,
p28
aVyou see real big differences in this part of the country right here,
p29
aVthe kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:
p30
aV20 or 30 point swings
p31
aVfrom how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did
p32
aVin 2008.
p33
aVYes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.
p36
aVThere is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"
p37
aVBut really the question here \u2014 Obama did relatively well in Kansas.
p38
aVHe lost badly but every Democrat does.
p39
aVHe lost no worse than most people do.
p40
aVBut yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVAnd when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.
p43
aVWe think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.
p44
aVAnd we think people like this probably don't want to vote
p45
aVfor people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.
p46
aVWe think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
p47
aVAre we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd the answer is: it is at least partially fair.
p50
aVWe know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that
p51
aVis because we asked those people.
p52
aVActually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted
p53
aVexit polls in every state,
p54
aVin 37 states, out of the 50,
p55
aVthey asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.
p56
aVThey asked this question.
p57
aVIn deciding your vote for President today, was the race
p58
aVof the candidate a factor?
p59
aVWe're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;
p60
aVmoreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"
p61
aVand people who voted for John McCain
p62
aVas a result of that factor,
p63
aVmaybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.
p64
aVWe're looking for this behavior among white voters
p65
aVor, really, non-black voters.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo you see big differences in different parts
p68
aVof the country on this question.
p69
aVIn Louisiana, about one in five white voters
p70
aVsaid, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama
p71
aVis because he was an African-American."
p72
aVIf those people had voted for Obama,
p73
aVeven half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.
p74
aVSame is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.
p75
aVMeanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"
p76
aVbut you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this
p77
aVadmitted, I suppose,
p78
aVmanifestation of racially-based voting.
p79
aVHere is the same data on a map.
p80
aVYou kind of see the relationship between
p81
aVthe redder states of where more people responded and said,
p82
aV"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."
p83
aVYou see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.
p84
aVThis really seems to explain
p85
aVwhy Barack Obama did worse
p86
aVin this one part of the country.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo we have to ask why.
p89
aVIs racism predictable in some way?
p90
aVIs there something driving this?
p91
aVIs it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas
p92
aVthat we don't understand, and Kentucky?
p93
aVOr are there more systematic factors at work?
p94
aVAnd so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
p95
aVThese are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time \u2014
p96
aVthings like income, and religion, education.
p97
aVWhich of these seem to drive
p98
aVthis manifestation of racism
p99
aVin this big national experiment we had on November 4th?
p100
aVAnd there are a couple of these that have
p101
aVstrong predictive relationships,
p102
aVone of which is education,
p103
aVwhere you see the states with the fewest years of schooling
p104
aVper adult are in red,
p105
aVand you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,
p106
aVis less educated. It's just a fact.
p107
aVAnd you see the relationship there
p108
aVwith the racially-based voting patterns.
p109
aVThe other variable that's important is
p110
aVthe type of neighborhood that you live in.
p111
aVStates that are more rural \u2014
p112
aVeven to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine \u2014
p113
aVthey exhibit a little bit of
p114
aVthis racially-based voting against Barack Obama.
p115
aVSo it's the combination of these two things: it's education
p116
aVand the type of neighbors that you have,
p117
aVwhich we'll talk about more in a moment.
p118
aVAnd the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee
p119
aVis that they're both very rural,
p120
aVand they are educationally impoverished.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo yes, racism is predictable.
p123
aVThese things, among maybe other variables,
p124
aVbut these things seem to predict it.
p125
aVWe're going to drill down a little bit more now,
p126
aVinto something called the General Social Survey.
p127
aVThis is conducted by the University of Chicago
p128
aVevery other year.
p129
aVAnd they ask a series of really interesting questions.
p130
aVIn 2000 they had particularly interesting questions
p131
aVabout racial attitudes.
p132
aVOne simple question they asked is,
p133
aV"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"
p134
aVWe can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.
p135
aVIn cites, about 80 percent of people
p136
aVhave someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,
p137
aVbut in rural communities, only about 30 percent.
p138
aVProbably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.
p139
aVBut nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people
p140
aVwho are unlike you.
p141
aVSo what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey
p142
aVand split them between those who have black neighbors \u2014
p143
aVor, really, some neighbor of another race \u2014
p144
aVand people who have only white neighbors.
p145
aVAnd we see in some variables
p146
aVin terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.
p147
aVThis was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.
p148
aVBut you see Democrats versus Republican,
p149
aVnot a big difference based on who your neighbors are.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd even some questions about race \u2014 for example
p152
aVaffirmative action, which is kind of a political question,
p153
aVa policy question about race, if you will \u2014
p154
aVnot much difference here.
p155
aVAffirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.
p156
aVBut people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods
p157
aVfeel no differently about it really.
p158
aVBut if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,
p159
aV"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
p160
aVThere is a big difference.
p161
aVPeople who don't have neighbors of a different race
p162
aVare about twice as likely
p163
aVto oppose interracial marriage as people who do.
p164
aVJust based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.
p165
aVAnd likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,
p166
aV"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"
p167
aVYou see people without neighbors who are African-American who
p168
aVwere much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."
p169
aa(lp170
VSo it's really not even about urban versus rural.
p171
aVIt's about who you live with.
p172
aVRacism is predictable. And it's predicted by
p173
aVinteraction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.
p174
aVSo if you want to address it,
p175
aVthe goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
p176
aVI have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,
p177
aVideas for maybe how to do that.
p178
aa(lp179
VI'm a big fan of cities.
p180
aVEspecially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,
p181
aVand can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.
p182
aVI think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,
p183
aVthe kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.
p184
aVBut also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.
p185
aVSo we can think more about things like street grids.
p186
aVThis is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.
p187
aVIt's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.
p188
aVYou have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.
p189
aVAnd you interact a lot with your neighbors \u2014
p190
aVpeople you like, people you might not know.
p191
aVAnd as a result it's a very tolerant community,
p192
aVwhich is different, I think, than something like this,
p193
aVwhich is in Schaumburg, Illinois,
p194
aVwhere every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac
p195
aVand drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.
p196
aVI think that actually this type of urban design,
p197
aVwhich became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s \u2014
p198
aVI think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming
p199
aVmore conservative under Ronald Reagan.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut also here is another idea we have \u2014
p202
aVis an intercollegiate exchange program
p203
aVwhere you have students going from New York abroad.
p204
aVBut frankly there are enough differences within the country now
p205
aVwhere maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,
p206
aVhave them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,
p207
aVand vice versa. Do it at the high school level.
p208
aVLiterally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee
p209
aVand might never interact in a positive affirmative way
p210
aVwith someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.
p211
aVI think part of the education variable we talked about before
p212
aVis the networking experience you get when you go to college
p213
aVwhere you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut the point is, this is all good news,
p216
aVbecause when something is predictable,
p217
aVit is what I call designable.
p218
aVYou can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,
p219
aVeven if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
p220
aVIf we understand the root causes of the behavior
p221
aVand where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,
p222
aVwe can start to design solutions to it.
p223
aVSo that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.
