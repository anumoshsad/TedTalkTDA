VJust a moment ago,
p4
aVmy daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.
p5
aVHer text said,
p6
aV"Mom, you will rock."
p7
aVI love this.
p8
aVGetting that text
p9
aVwas like getting a hug.
p10
aVAnd so there you have it.
p11
aVI embody
p12
aVthe central paradox.
p13
aVI'm a woman
p14
aVwho loves getting texts
p15
aVwho's going to tell you
p16
aVthat too many of them can be a problem.
p17
aa(lp18
VActually that reminder of my daughter
p19
aVbrings me to the beginning of my story.
p20
aV1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,
p21
aVRebecca was five years old
p22
aVand she was sitting right there
p23
aVin the front row.
p24
aVI had just written a book
p25
aVthat celebrated our life on the internet
p26
aVand I was about to be on the cover
p27
aVof Wired magazine.
p28
aVIn those heady days,
p29
aVwe were experimenting
p30
aVwith chat rooms and online virtual communities.
p31
aVWe were exploring different aspects of ourselves.
p32
aVAnd then we unplugged.
p33
aVI was excited.
p34
aVAnd, as a psychologist, what excited me most
p35
aVwas the idea
p36
aVthat we would use what we learned in the virtual world
p37
aVabout ourselves, about our identity,
p38
aVto live better lives in the real world.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow fast-forward to 2012.
p41
aVI'm back here on the TED stage again.
p42
aVMy daughter's 20. She's a college student.
p43
aVShe sleeps with her cellphone,
p44
aVso do I.
p45
aVAnd I've just written a new book,
p46
aVbut this time it's not one
p47
aVthat will get me on the cover
p48
aVof Wired magazine.
p49
aVSo what happened?
p50
aVI'm still excited by technology,
p51
aVbut I believe,
p52
aVand I'm here to make the case,
p53
aVthat we're letting it take us places
p54
aVthat we don't want to go.
p55
aa(lp56
VOver the past 15 years,
p57
aVI've studied technologies of mobile communication
p58
aVand I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,
p59
aVyoung and old,
p60
aVabout their plugged in lives.
p61
aVAnd what I've found
p62
aVis that our little devices,
p63
aVthose little devices in our pockets,
p64
aVare so psychologically powerful
p65
aVthat they don't only change what we do,
p66
aVthey change who we are.
p67
aVSome of the things we do now with our devices
p68
aVare things that, only a few years ago,
p69
aVwe would have found odd
p70
aVor disturbing,
p71
aVbut they've quickly come to seem familiar,
p72
aVjust how we do things.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo just to take some quick examples:
p75
aVPeople text or do email
p76
aVduring corporate board meetings.
p77
aVThey text and shop and go on Facebook
p78
aVduring classes, during presentations,
p79
aVactually during all meetings.
p80
aVPeople talk to me about the important new skill
p81
aVof making eye contact
p82
aVwhile you're texting.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVPeople explain to me
p85
aVthat it's hard, but that it can be done.
p86
aVParents text and do email
p87
aVat breakfast and at dinner
p88
aVwhile their children complain
p89
aVabout not having their parents' full attention.
p90
aVBut then these same children
p91
aVdeny each other their full attention.
p92
aVThis is a recent shot
p93
aVof my daughter and her friends
p94
aVbeing together
p95
aVwhile not being together.
p96
aVAnd we even text at funerals.
p97
aVI study this.
p98
aVWe remove ourselves
p99
aVfrom our grief or from our revery
p100
aVand we go into our phones.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhy does this matter?
p103
aVIt matters to me
p104
aVbecause I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble \u2014
p105
aVtrouble certainly
p106
aVin how we relate to each other,
p107
aVbut also trouble
p108
aVin how we relate to ourselves
p109
aVand our capacity for self-reflection.
p110
aVWe're getting used to a new way
p111
aVof being alone together.
p112
aVPeople want to be with each other,
p113
aVbut also elsewhere \u2014
p114
aVconnected to all the different places they want to be.
p115
aVPeople want to customize their lives.
p116
aVThey want to go in and out of all the places they are
p117
aVbecause the thing that matters most to them
p118
aVis control over where they put their attention.
p119
aVSo you want to go to that board meeting,
p120
aVbut you only want to pay attention
p121
aVto the bits that interest you.
p122
aVAnd some people think that's a good thing.
p123
aVBut you can end up
p124
aVhiding from each other,
p125
aVeven as we're all constantly connected to each other.
p126
aa(lp127
VA 50-year-old business man
p128
aVlamented to me
p129
aVthat he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.
p130
aVWhen he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,
p131
aVhe doesn't call.
p132
aVAnd he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues
p133
aVbecause, he says, "They're too busy on their email."
p134
aVBut then he stops himself
p135
aVand he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.
p136
aVI'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.
p137
aVI think I should want to,
p138
aVbut actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."
p139
aa(lp140
VAcross the generations,
p141
aVI see that people can't get enough of each other,
p142
aVif and only if
p143
aVthey can have each other at a distance,
p144
aVin amounts they can control.
p145
aVI call it the Goldilocks effect:
p146
aVnot too close, not too far,
p147
aVjust right.
p148
aVBut what might feel just right
p149
aVfor that middle-aged executive
p150
aVcan be a problem for an adolescent
p151
aVwho needs to develop face-to-face relationships.
p152
aVAn 18-year-old boy
p153
aVwho uses texting for almost everything
p154
aVsays to me wistfully,
p155
aV"Someday, someday,
p156
aVbut certainly not now,
p157
aVI'd like to learn how to have a conversation."
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen I ask people
p160
aV"What's wrong with having a conversation?"
p161
aVPeople say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.
p162
aVIt takes place in real time
p163
aVand you can't control what you're going to say."
p164
aVSo that's the bottom line.
p165
aVTexting, email, posting,
p166
aVall of these things
p167
aVlet us present the self as we want to be.
p168
aVWe get to edit,
p169
aVand that means we get to delete,
p170
aVand that means we get to retouch,
p171
aVthe face, the voice,
p172
aVthe flesh, the body \u2014
p173
aVnot too little, not too much,
p174
aVjust right.
p175
aa(lp176
VHuman relationships
p177
aVare rich and they're messy
p178
aVand they're demanding.
p179
aVAnd we clean them up with technology.
p180
aVAnd when we do,
p181
aVone of the things that can happen
p182
aVis that we sacrifice conversation
p183
aVfor mere connection.
p184
aVWe short-change ourselves.
p185
aVAnd over time,
p186
aVwe seem to forget this,
p187
aVor we seem to stop caring.
p188
aa(lp189
VI was caught off guard
p190
aVwhen Stephen Colbert
p191
aVasked me a profound question,
p192
aVa profound question.
p193
aVHe said, "Don't all those little tweets,
p194
aVdon't all those little sips
p195
aVof online communication,
p196
aVadd up to one big gulp
p197
aVof real conversation?"
p198
aVMy answer was no,
p199
aVthey don't add up.
p200
aVConnecting in sips may work
p201
aVfor gathering discrete bits of information,
p202
aVthey may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"
p203
aVor even for saying, "I love you," \u2014
p204
aVI mean, look at how I felt
p205
aVwhen I got that text from my daughter \u2014
p206
aVbut they don't really work
p207
aVfor learning about each other,
p208
aVfor really coming to know and understand each other.
p209
aVAnd we use conversations with each other
p210
aVto learn how to have conversations
p211
aVwith ourselves.
p212
aVSo a flight from conversation
p213
aVcan really matter
p214
aVbecause it can compromise
p215
aVour capacity for self-reflection.
p216
aVFor kids growing up,
p217
aVthat skill is the bedrock of development.
p218
aa(lp219
VOver and over I hear,
p220
aV"I would rather text than talk."
p221
aVAnd what I'm seeing
p222
aVis that people get so used to being short-changed
p223
aVout of real conversation,
p224
aVso used to getting by with less,
p225
aVthat they've become almost willing
p226
aVto dispense with people altogether.
p227
aVSo for example,
p228
aVmany people share with me this wish,
p229
aVthat some day a more advanced version of Siri,
p230
aVthe digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,
p231
aVwill be more like a best friend,
p232
aVsomeone who will listen
p233
aVwhen others won't.
p234
aVI believe this wish
p235
aVreflects a painful truth
p236
aVthat I've learned in the past 15 years.
p237
aVThat feeling that no one is listening to me
p238
aVis very important
p239
aVin our relationships with technology.
p240
aVThat's why it's so appealing
p241
aVto have a Facebook page
p242
aVor a Twitter feed \u2014
p243
aVso many automatic listeners.
p244
aVAnd the feeling that no one is listening to me
p245
aVmake us want to spend time
p246
aVwith machines that seem to care about us.
p247
aa(lp248
VWe're developing robots,
p249
aVthey call them sociable robots,
p250
aVthat are specifically designed to be companions \u2014
p251
aVto the elderly,
p252
aVto our children,
p253
aVto us.
p254
aVHave we so lost confidence
p255
aVthat we will be there for each other?
p256
aVDuring my research
p257
aVI worked in nursing homes,
p258
aVand I brought in these sociable robots
p259
aVthat were designed to give the elderly
p260
aVthe feeling that they were understood.
p261
aVAnd one day I came in
p262
aVand a woman who had lost a child
p263
aVwas talking to a robot
p264
aVin the shape of a baby seal.
p265
aVIt seemed to be looking in her eyes.
p266
aVIt seemed to be following the conversation.
p267
aVIt comforted her.
p268
aVAnd many people found this amazing.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut that woman was trying to make sense of her life
p271
aVwith a machine that had no experience
p272
aVof the arc of a human life.
p273
aVThat robot put on a great show.
p274
aVAnd we're vulnerable.
p275
aVPeople experience pretend empathy
p276
aVas though it were the real thing.
p277
aVSo during that moment
p278
aVwhen that woman
p279
aVwas experiencing that pretend empathy,
p280
aVI was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.
p281
aVIt doesn't face death.
p282
aVIt doesn't know life."
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd as that woman took comfort
p285
aVin her robot companion,
p286
aVI didn't find it amazing;
p287
aVI found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments
p288
aVin my 15 years of work.
p289
aVBut when I stepped back,
p290
aVI felt myself
p291
aVat the cold, hard center
p292
aVof a perfect storm.
p293
aVWe expect more from technology
p294
aVand less from each other.
p295
aVAnd I ask myself,
p296
aV"Why have things come to this?"
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd I believe it's because
p299
aVtechnology appeals to us most
p300
aVwhere we are most vulnerable.
p301
aVAnd we are vulnerable.
p302
aVWe're lonely,
p303
aVbut we're afraid of intimacy.
p304
aVAnd so from social networks to sociable robots,
p305
aVwe're designing technologies
p306
aVthat will give us the illusion of companionship
p307
aVwithout the demands of friendship.
p308
aVWe turn to technology to help us feel connected
p309
aVin ways we can comfortably control.
p310
aVBut we're not so comfortable.
p311
aVWe are not so much in control.
p312
aa(lp313
VThese days, those phones in our pockets
p314
aVare changing our minds and hearts
p315
aVbecause they offer us
p316
aVthree gratifying fantasies.
p317
aVOne, that we can put our attention
p318
aVwherever we want it to be;
p319
aVtwo, that we will always be heard;
p320
aVand three, that we will never have to be alone.
p321
aVAnd that third idea,
p322
aVthat we will never have to be alone,
p323
aVis central to changing our psyches.
p324
aVBecause the moment that people are alone,
p325
aVeven for a few seconds,
p326
aVthey become anxious, they panic, they fidget,
p327
aVthey reach for a device.
p328
aVJust think of people at a checkout line
p329
aVor at a red light.
p330
aVBeing alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.
p331
aVAnd so people try to solve it by connecting.
p332
aVBut here, connection
p333
aVis more like a symptom than a cure.
p334
aVIt expresses, but it doesn't solve,
p335
aVan underlying problem.
p336
aVBut more than a symptom,
p337
aVconstant connection is changing
p338
aVthe way people think of themselves.
p339
aVIt's shaping a new way of being.
p340
aa(lp341
VThe best way to describe it is,
p342
aVI share therefore I am.
p343
aVWe use technology to define ourselves
p344
aVby sharing our thoughts and feelings
p345
aVeven as we're having them.
p346
aVSo before it was:
p347
aVI have a feeling,
p348
aVI want to make a call.
p349
aVNow it's: I want to have a feeling,
p350
aVI need to send a text.
p351
aVThe problem with this new regime
p352
aVof "I share therefore I am"
p353
aVis that, if we don't have connection,
p354
aVwe don't feel like ourselves.
p355
aVWe almost don't feel ourselves.
p356
aVSo what do we do? We connect more and more.
p357
aVBut in the process,
p358
aVwe set ourselves up to be isolated.
p359
aa(lp360
VHow do you get from connection to isolation?
p361
aVYou end up isolated
p362
aVif you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,
p363
aVthe ability to be separate,
p364
aVto gather yourself.
p365
aVSolitude is where you find yourself
p366
aVso that you can reach out to other people
p367
aVand form real attachments.
p368
aVWhen we don't have the capacity for solitude,
p369
aVwe turn to other people in order to feel less anxious
p370
aVor in order to feel alive.
p371
aVWhen this happens,
p372
aVwe're not able to appreciate who they are.
p373
aVIt's as though we're using them
p374
aVas spare parts
p375
aVto support our fragile sense of self.
p376
aVWe slip into thinking that always being connected
p377
aVis going to make us feel less alone.
p378
aVBut we're at risk,
p379
aVbecause actually it's the opposite that's true.
p380
aVIf we're not able to be alone,
p381
aVwe're going to be more lonely.
p382
aVAnd if we don't teach our children to be alone,
p383
aVthey're only going to know
p384
aVhow to be lonely.
p385
aa(lp386
VWhen I spoke at TED in 1996,
p387
aVreporting on my studies
p388
aVof the early virtual communities,
p389
aVI said, "Those who make the most
p390
aVof their lives on the screen
p391
aVcome to it in a spirit of self-reflection."
p392
aVAnd that's what I'm calling for here, now:
p393
aVreflection and, more than that, a conversation
p394
aVabout where our current use of technology
p395
aVmay be taking us,
p396
aVwhat it might be costing us.
p397
aVWe're smitten with technology.
p398
aVAnd we're afraid, like young lovers,
p399
aVthat too much talking might spoil the romance.
p400
aVBut it's time to talk.
p401
aVWe grew up with digital technology
p402
aVand so we see it as all grown up.
p403
aVBut it's not, it's early days.
p404
aVThere's plenty of time
p405
aVfor us to reconsider how we use it,
p406
aVhow we build it.
p407
aVI'm not suggesting
p408
aVthat we turn away from our devices,
p409
aVjust that we develop a more self-aware relationship
p410
aVwith them, with each other
p411
aVand with ourselves.
p412
aa(lp413
VI see some first steps.
p414
aVStart thinking of solitude
p415
aVas a good thing.
p416
aVMake room for it.
p417
aVFind ways to demonstrate this
p418
aVas a value to your children.
p419
aVCreate sacred spaces at home \u2014
p420
aVthe kitchen, the dining room \u2014
p421
aVand reclaim them for conversation.
p422
aVDo the same thing at work.
p423
aVAt work, we're so busy communicating
p424
aVthat we often don't have time to think,
p425
aVwe don't have time to talk,
p426
aVabout the things that really matter.
p427
aVChange that.
p428
aVMost important, we all really need to listen to each other,
p429
aVincluding to the boring bits.
p430
aVBecause it's when we stumble
p431
aVor hesitate or lose our words
p432
aVthat we reveal ourselves to each other.
p433
aa(lp434
VTechnology is making a bid
p435
aVto redefine human connection \u2014
p436
aVhow we care for each other,
p437
aVhow we care for ourselves \u2014
p438
aVbut it's also giving us the opportunity
p439
aVto affirm our values
p440
aVand our direction.
p441
aVI'm optimistic.
p442
aVWe have everything we need to start.
p443
aVWe have each other.
p444
aVAnd we have the greatest chance of success
p445
aVif we recognize our vulnerability.
p446
aVThat we listen
p447
aVwhen technology says
p448
aVit will take something complicated
p449
aVand promises something simpler.
p450
aa(lp451
VSo in my work,
p452
aVI hear that life is hard,
p453
aVrelationships are filled with risk.
p454
aVAnd then there's technology \u2014
p455
aVsimpler, hopeful,
p456
aVoptimistic, ever-young.
p457
aVIt's like calling in the cavalry.
p458
aVAn ad campaign promises
p459
aVthat online and with avatars,
p460
aVyou can "Finally, love your friends
p461
aVlove your body, love your life,
p462
aVonline and with avatars."
p463
aVWe're drawn to virtual romance,
p464
aVto computer games that seem like worlds,
p465
aVto the idea that robots, robots,
p466
aVwill someday be our true companions.
p467
aVWe spend an evening on the social network
p468
aVinstead of going to the pub with friends.
p469
aa(lp470
VBut our fantasies of substitution
p471
aVhave cost us.
p472
aVNow we all need to focus
p473
aVon the many, many ways
p474
aVtechnology can lead us back
p475
aVto our real lives, our own bodies,
p476
aVour own communities,
p477
aVour own politics,
p478
aVour own planet.
p479
aVThey need us.
p480
aVLet's talk about
p481
aVhow we can use digital technology,
p482
aVthe technology of our dreams,
p483
aVto make this life
p484
aVthe life we can love.
p485
