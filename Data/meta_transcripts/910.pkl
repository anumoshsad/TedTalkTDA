VI'm Ellen and I'm totally obsessed with food.
p4
aVBut I didn't start out obsessed with food.
p5
aVI started out obsessed with global security policy,
p6
aVbecause I lived in New York during 9/11 and it was a very relevant thing.
p7
aVI got from global security policy to food
p8
aVbecause I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off,
p9
aVand I'm assuming the rest of the world is too.
p10
aVEspecially if you and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry
p11
aVand your whole neighborhood is hungry.
p12
aVAnd actually, it looks like the areas of the world that are hungry
p13
aVare also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme
p16
aVas a way to try to address these security issues
p17
aVthrough food security issues.
p18
aVThere, I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs.
p19
aVIt's called School Feeding and it's a really simple idea
p20
aVto get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger
p21
aVthat continues for a lot of people around the world, and stop it.
p22
aVA free school meal gets kids into school,
p23
aVwhich is education, the first step out of poverty,
p24
aVbut it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need
p25
aVto develop mentally and physically.
p26
aa(lp27
VWhile I was working at the UN, I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.
p28
aVAnd she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" \u2014
p29
aVwhich is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag.
p30
aVBut each bag we'd sell would provide
p31
aVa year's worth of school meals for one kid.
p32
aVIt's so simple, and we thought, OK,
p33
aVit costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year.
p34
aVWe could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and awareness
p35
aVfor the World Food Programme.
p36
aVBut at the UN, sometimes things move slowly
p37
aVand they basically said no.
p38
aVAnd we thought, this is such a good idea, it's going to raise so much money.
p39
aVSo we said screw it, we'll start our own company,
p40
aVwhich we did, three years ago.
p41
aVThat was my first dream, to start this company called FEED,
p42
aVand here's a screenshot of our website.
p43
aVWe did a bag for Haiti just a month after the earthquake
p44
aVto provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
p45
aVSo FEED's doing great.
p46
aVWe've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world
p47
aVby selling now 550,000 bags, a ton of bags, a lot of bags.
p48
aa(lp49
VAll this time you're really \u2014
p50
aVhunger is a hard thing to think about,
p51
aVbecause what we think about is eating.
p52
aVI think about eating a lot and I really love it.
p53
aVAnd the thing that's strange about international hunger
p54
aVand talking about international issues
p55
aVis that most people want to know:
p56
aV"What are you doing for America's kids?"
p57
aVThere's definitely hunger in America:
p58
aV49 million people and almost 16.7 million children.
p59
aVI mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country.
p60
aVHunger definitely means something different in America
p61
aVthan it does internationally,
p62
aVbut it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country.
p63
aVBut the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity,
p64
aVand it's dramatic.
p65
aVThe other thing that's dramatic
p66
aVis that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years.
p67
aVUnfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem.
p68
aVIt's actually been spreading all around the world
p69
aVand mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting.
p70
aVThe numbers are pretty crazy.
p71
aVThere's a billion people obese or overweight
p72
aVand a billion people hungry.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo those seem like two bifurcated problems,
p75
aVbut I kind of started to think about, you know,
p76
aVwhat is obesity and hunger?
p77
aVWhat are both those things about?
p78
aVWell, they're both about food.
p79
aVAnd when you think about food,
p80
aVthe underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.
p81
aVAnd agriculture is where food comes from.
p82
aVAgriculture in America's very interesting.
p83
aVIt's very consolidated
p84
aVand the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
p85
aVThe foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat.
p86
aVAnd that's three-quarters of the food that we're eating:
p87
aVprocessed foods and fast foods.
p88
aVUnfortunately, in our agricultural system,
p89
aVwe haven't done a good job in the last three decades
p90
aVof exporting those technologies around the world.
p91
aVSo African agriculture, which is the place of most hunger in the world,
p92
aVhas actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen.
p93
aVSo somehow we're not making the connect
p94
aVbetween exporting a good agricultural system
p95
aVthat will help feed people all around the world.
p96
aa(lp97
VWho is farming? That's what I was wondering.
p98
aVSo I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest,
p99
aVand that really didn't help me understand farming,
p100
aVbut I think it's a really cool picture.
p101
aVAnd the reality is that between farmers in America \u2014
p102
aVwho actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest,
p103
aVare pretty large in general.
p104
aVAnd their farms are also large.
p105
aVBut farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny,
p106
aVand that's because they're starving.
p107
aVMost hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers.
p108
aVAnd most of those people are women \u2014
p109
aVwhich is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now,
p110
aVbut I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point.
p111
aVI think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.
p112
aVThere's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America,
p113
aVand it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis,
p114
aVwhen, you know \u2014 mass consolidation,
p115
aVmass exodus of small farmers in this country.
p116
aVAnd then in the same time period,
p117
aVwe've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing.
p118
aVUnfortunately, what is farmed ends up as what we eat.
p119
aVAnd in America, a lot of what we eat has led to obesity
p120
aVand has led to a real change
p121
aVin sort of what our diet is, in the last 30 years.
p122
aa(lp123
VIt's crazy.
p124
aVA fifth of kids under two drinks soda.
p125
aVHello! You don't put soda in bottles.
p126
aVBut people do, because it's so cheap,
p127
aVand so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted.
p128
aVI mean, you know, it's not just in our own country,
p129
aVbut really we're exporting the system around the world,
p130
aVand when you look at the data of least developed countries \u2014
p131
aVespecially in cities, which are growing really rapidly \u2014
p132
aVpeople are eating American processed foods.
p133
aVAnd in one generation, they're going from hunger
p134
aVand all of the detrimental health effects of hunger
p135
aVto obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation.
p136
aVSo the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity.
p137
aVNot to beat a dead horse, but this is a global food system
p138
aVwhere there's a billion people hungry and a billion people obese.
p139
aVI think that's the only way to look at it.
p140
aVAnd instead of taking these two things
p141
aVas bifurcated problems that are very separate,
p142
aVit's really important to look at them as one system.
p143
aVWe get a lot of our food from all around the world
p144
aVand people from all around the world are importing our food system,
p145
aVso it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it.
p146
aa(lp147
VI've learned \u2014 and the technology people here,
p148
aVwhich I'm totally not one of \u2014
p149
aVbut apparently, it really takes 30 years
p150
aVfor a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us,
p151
aVlike the mouse and the Internet and Windows.
p152
aVYou know, there's 30-year cycles.
p153
aVI think 2010 can be a really interesting year
p154
aVbecause it is the end of the 30-year cycle,
p155
aVand it's the birthday of the global food system.
p156
aVThat's the first birthday I want to talk about.
p157
aVIf we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years,
p158
aVthere's hope in that.
p159
aVIt's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops
p160
aVand the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high-fructose corn syrup,
p161
aVthe farm crisis in America
p162
aVand the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally.
p163
aVSo there's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period
p164
aVas sort of the creation of this new food system.
p165
aVI'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.
p166
aVThe icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish
p167
aVboth addressed this last three-decade time period
p168
aVas incredibly relevant for food system change.
p169
aVWell, I really care about 1980
p170
aVbecause it's also the 30th anniversary of me this year.
p171
aVAnd so in my lifetime,
p172
aVa lot of what's happened in the world \u2014
p173
aVand being a person obsessed with food \u2014
p174
aVa lot of this has really changed.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo my second dream is that I think we can look to the next 30 years
p177
aVas a time to change the food system again.
p178
aVAnd we know what's happened in the past,
p179
aVso if we start now and we look at technologies
p180
aVand improvements to the food system long-term,
p181
aVwe might be able to recreate the food system
p182
aVso when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old,
p183
aVI'll be able to say that it's been a success.
p184
aVSo I'm announcing today the start of a new organization,
p185
aVor a new fund within the FEED Foundation, called the 30 Project.
p186
aVAnd the 30 Project is really focused
p187
aVon these long-term ideas for food system change.
p188
aVAnd I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger
p189
aVand domestic advocates that are addressing obesity,
p190
aVwe might actually look for long-term solutions
p191
aVthat will make the food system better for everyone.
p192
aa(lp193
VWe all tend to think that these systems are quite different
p194
aVand people argue whether or not organic can feed the world,
p195
aVbut if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas.
p196
aVSo I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations
p197
aVlike the ONE campaign and Slow Food,
p198
aVwhich don't seem right now to have much in common,
p199
aVwe can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions
p200
aVthat will improve food for everyone.
p201
aVSome ideas I've had is like, look, the reality is \u2014
p202
aVkids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots
p203
aVand so do kids in Botswana.
p204
aVAnd how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods?
p205
aa(lp206
VAnother thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish.
p207
aVUnderstanding how to produce protein
p208
aVin a way that's healthy for the environment
p209
aVand healthy for people
p210
aVwill be incredibly important to address things like climate change
p211
aVand how we use petrochemical fertilizers.
p212
aVAnd, you know, these are really relevant topics
p213
aVthat are long-term and important
p214
aVfor both people in Africa who are small farmers
p215
aVand people in America who are farmers and eaters.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way,
p218
aVwhere we actually price the negative externalities
p219
aVlike petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff
p220
aVinto the price of a bag of chips \u2014
p221
aVWell, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple,
p222
aVthen maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice
p223
aVbecause the choices are actually choices
p224
aVinstead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe 30Project.org is launched
p227
aVand I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.
p228
aVAnd it'll be growing over the next few months.
p229
aVBut I really hope that you will all think of ways
p230
aVthat you can look long-term at things like the food system
p231
aVand make change.
