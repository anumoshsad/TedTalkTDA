VWhat is a parent?
p4
aa(lp5
VWhat is a parent?
p6
aa(lp7
VIt's not an easy question.
p8
aVToday we have adoption,
p9
aVstepfamilies,
p10
aVsurrogate mothers.
p11
aVMany parents face tough questions
p12
aVand tough decisions.
p13
aVShall we tell our child about the sperm donation?
p14
aVIf so, when?
p15
aVWhat words to use?
p16
aVSperm donors are often referred to as "biological fathers,"
p17
aVbut should we really be using the word "father?"
p18
aa(lp19
VAs a philosopher and social scientist,
p20
aVI have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood.
p21
aVBut today, I will talk to you about what I learned
p22
aVfrom talking to parents and children.
p23
aVI will show you that they know what matters most in a family,
p24
aVeven though their family looks a little different.
p25
aVI will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions.
p26
aVBut I will also show you the parents' uncertainties.
p27
aa(lp28
VWe interviewed couples
p29
aVwho received fertility treatment at Ghent University Hospital,
p30
aVusing sperm from a donor.
p31
aVIn this treatment timeline,
p32
aVyou can see two points at which we conducted interviews.
p33
aVWe included heterosexual couples,
p34
aVwhere the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm,
p35
aVand lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere.
p36
aVWe also included children.
p37
aVI wanted to know
p38
aVhow those children define concepts like parenthood and family.
p39
aVIn fact, that is what I asked them,
p40
aVonly not in that way.
p41
aVI drew an apple tree instead.
p42
aVThis way, I could ask abstract, philosophical questions
p43
aVin a way that did not make them run off.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo as you can see,
p46
aVthe apple tree is empty.
p47
aVAnd that illustrates my research approach.
p48
aVBy designing techniques like this,
p49
aVI can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview,
p50
aVbecause I want to hear that from them.
p51
aa(lp52
VI asked them:
p53
aVWhat would your family look like if it were an apple tree?
p54
aVAnd they could take a paper apple for everyone who, in their view,
p55
aVwas a member of the family,
p56
aVwrite a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted.
p57
aVAnd I would ask questions.
p58
aVMost children started with a parent or a sibling.
p59
aVOne started with "Boxer,"
p60
aVthe dead dog of his grandparents.
p61
aa(lp62
VAt this point, none of the children started mentioning the donor.
p63
aVSo, I asked them about their birth story.
p64
aVI said, "Before you were born,
p65
aVit was just your mom and dad,
p66
aVor mom and mommy.
p67
aVCan you tell me how you came into the family?"
p68
aVAnd they explained.
p69
aVOne said,
p70
aV"My parents did not have good seeds,
p71
aVbut there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds.
p72
aVThey bring them to the hospital,
p73
aVand they put them in a big jar.
p74
aVMy mommy went there,
p75
aVand she took two from the jar,
p76
aVone for me and one for my sister.
p77
aVShe put the seeds in her belly \u2014
p78
aVsomehow \u2014
p79
aVand her belly grew really big,
p80
aVand there I was."
p81
aa(lp82
VHmm.
p83
aVSo only when they started mentioning the donor,
p84
aVI asked questions about him, using their own words.
p85
aVI said,
p86
aV"If this would be an apple for the friendly man with the seeds,
p87
aVwhat would you do with it?"
p88
aVAnd one boy was thinking out loud,
p89
aVholding the apple.
p90
aVAnd he said,
p91
aV"I won't put this one up there with the others.
p92
aVHe's not part of my family.
p93
aVBut I will not put him on the ground.
p94
aVThat's too cold and too hard.
p95
aVI think he should be in the trunk,
p96
aVbecause he made my family possible.
p97
aVIf he would not have done this,
p98
aVthat would really be sad because my family would not be here,
p99
aVand I would not be here."
p100
aa(lp101
VSo also, parents constructed family tales \u2014
p102
aVtales to tell their children.
p103
aVOne couple explained their insemination
p104
aVby taking their children to a farm
p105
aVto watch a vet inseminate cows.
p106
aVAnd why not?
p107
aVIt's their way of explaining;
p108
aVtheir do-it-yourself with family narratives.
p109
aVDIY.
p110
aVAnd we had another couple who made books \u2014
p111
aVa book for each child.
p112
aVThey were really works of art
p113
aVcontaining their thoughts and feelings throughout the treatment.
p114
aVThey even had the hospital parking tickets in there.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo it is DIY:
p117
aVfinding ways, words and images
p118
aVto tell your family story to your child.
p119
aVAnd these stories were highly diverse,
p120
aVbut they all had one thing in common:
p121
aVit was a tale of longing for a child
p122
aVand a quest for that child.
p123
aVIt was about how special and how deeply loved their child was.
p124
aVAnd research so far shows that these children are doing fine.
p125
aVThey do not have more problems than other kids.
p126
aa(lp127
VYet, these parents also wanted to justify their decisions
p128
aVthrough the tales they tell.
p129
aVThey hoped that their children would understand their reasons
p130
aVfor making the family in this way.
p131
aVUnderlying was a fear that their children might disapprove
p132
aVand would reject the non-genetic parent.
p133
aVAnd that fear is understandable,
p134
aVbecause we live in a very heteronormative
p135
aVand geneticized society \u2014
p136
aVa world that still believes
p137
aVthat true families consist of one mom, one dad
p138
aVand their genetically related children.
p139
aa(lp140
VWell.
p141
aVI want to tell you about a teenage boy.
p142
aVHe was donor-conceived but not part of our study.
p143
aVOne day, he had an argument with his father,
p144
aVand he yelled,
p145
aV"You're telling me what to do?
p146
aVYou're not even my father!"
p147
aVThat was exactly what the parents in our study feared.
p148
aVNow, the boy soon felt sorry, and they made up.
p149
aVBut it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting.
p150
aa(lp151
VHe said,
p152
aV"This outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link.
p153
aVIt was about puberty \u2014
p154
aVbeing difficult.
p155
aVIt's what they do at that age.
p156
aVIt will pass."
p157
aa(lp158
VWhat this man shows us
p159
aVis that when something goes wrong,
p160
aVwe should not immediately think
p161
aVit is because the family is a little different.
p162
aVThese things happen in all families.
p163
aVAnd every now and then,
p164
aVall parents may wonder:
p165
aVAm I a good enough parent?
p166
aVThese parents, too.
p167
aVThey, above all, wanted to do what's best for their child.
p168
aVBut they also sometimes wondered:
p169
aVAm I a real parent?
p170
aVAnd their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents.
p171
aa(lp172
VAt the start of treatment,
p173
aVwhen they first saw the counselor,
p174
aVthey paid close attention to the counselor,
p175
aVbecause they wanted to do it right.
p176
aVEven 10 years later,
p177
aVthey still remember the advice they were given.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo when they thought about the counselor
p180
aVand the advice they were given,
p181
aVwe discussed that.
p182
aVAnd we saw one lesbian couple who said,
p183
aV"When our son asks us,
p184
aV'Do I have a dad?'
p185
aVwe will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'
p186
aVBut we will say nothing more, not unless he asks,
p187
aVbecause he might not be ready for that.
p188
aVThe counselor said so."
p189
aa(lp190
VWell.
p191
aVI don't know; that's quite different
p192
aVfrom how we respond to children's questions.
p193
aVLike, "Milk \u2014 is that made in a factory?"
p194
aVWe will say, "No, it comes from cows,"
p195
aVand we will talk about the farmer,
p196
aVand the way the milk ends up in the shop.
p197
aVWe will not say,
p198
aV"No, milk is not made in a factory."
p199
aVSo something strange happened here,
p200
aVand of course these children noticed that.
p201
aa(lp202
VOne boy said,
p203
aV"I asked my parents loads of questions,
p204
aVbut they acted really weird.
p205
aVSo, you know, I have a friend at school, and she's made in the same way.
p206
aVWhen I have a question, I just go and ask her."
p207
aVClever guy.
p208
aVProblem solved.
p209
aVBut his parents did not notice,
p210
aVand it certainly was not what they had in mind,
p211
aVnor what the counselor had in mind
p212
aVwhen they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd that's the strange thing about advice.
p215
aVWhen we offer people pills, we gather evidence first.
p216
aVWe do tests,
p217
aVwe do follow-up studies.
p218
aVWe want to know, and rightly so, what this pill is doing
p219
aVand how it affects people's lives.
p220
aVAnd advice?
p221
aVIt is not enough for advice,
p222
aVor for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound,
p223
aVor well-meant.
p224
aVIt should be advice that there is evidence for \u2014
p225
aVevidence that it actually improves patients' lives.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox:
p228
aVI advise you to stop following advice.
p229
aVBut, yes.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VI will not end here with what went wrong;
p234
aVI would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families.
p235
aVRemember the books and the trip to the farmer?
p236
aVWhen parents do things that work for them,
p237
aVthey do brilliant things.
p238
aVWhat I want you to remember as members of families,
p239
aVin no matter what form or shape,
p240
aVis that what families need are warm relationships.
p241
aVAnd we do not need to be professionals to create those.
p242
aVMost of us do just fine,
p243
aValthough it may be hard work,
p244
aVand from time to time, we can do with some advice.
p245
aa(lp246
VIn that case,
p247
aVbear in mind three things.
p248
aVWork with advice that works for your family.
p249
aVRemember \u2014 you're the expert, because you live your family life.
p250
aVAnd finally,
p251
aVbelieve in your abilities and your creativity,
p252
aVbecause you can do it yourself.
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you.
