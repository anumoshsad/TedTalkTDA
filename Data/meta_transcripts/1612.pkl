(lp3
VLet me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.
p4
aVAnd I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)
p5
aVWe have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,
p6
aVa young superstar writer whose book involves
p7
aVso many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;
p8
aVa New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.
p9
aVIt's been fantastic.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, of course, not all deception hits the news.
p12
aVMuch of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research
p13
aVshows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.
p14
aVSo it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.
p15
aVLet's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,
p16
aVin the last 24 hours \u2014 think back \u2014 have told a little fib,
p17
aVor a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?
p18
aa(lp19
VAll right, good. These are all the liars.
p20
aVMake sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VNo, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.
p23
aVThe other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,
p24
aVor you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,
p25
aVvery devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,
p26
aVwhich suggests that lying is very pervasive.
p27
aVIt's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality
p28
aVto what it means to be a human, the fact that we can
p29
aVtell the truth or make something up,
p30
aVthat has fascinated people throughout history.
p31
aVHere we have Diogenes with his lantern.
p32
aVDoes anybody know what he was looking for?
p33
aVA single honest man, and he died without finding one
p34
aVback in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East
p35
aVwho was really concerned with sincerity,
p36
aVnot only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,
p37
aVbut that you believed in what you were doing.
p38
aVYou believed in your principles.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow my first professional encounter with deception
p41
aVis a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
p42
aVI was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.
p43
aVYeah. I was defending Canada's borders.
p44
aVYou may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,
p45
aVthat's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)
p46
aVVery Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception
p47
aVwhile doing my duty here in customs,
p48
aVone of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,
p49
aVand I'll tell you about some of that tonight.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate
p52
aVhas been completely transformed. We email, we text,
p53
aVwe skype, we Facebook. It's insane.
p54
aVAlmost every aspect of human communication's been changed,
p55
aVand of course that's had an impact on deception.
p56
aVLet me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions
p57
aVwe've been tracking and documenting.
p58
aVThey're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet
p59
aVand the Chinese Water Army.
p60
aVIt sounds a little bit like a weird book,
p61
aVbut actually they're all new types of lies.
p62
aa(lp63
VLet's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:
p64
aV"On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"
p65
aVThen you've also lied. (Laughter)
p66
aVWe're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.
p67
aVHere's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.
p68
aVMy battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.
p69
aVYou weren't in a dead zone.
p70
aVYou just didn't want to respond to that person that time.
p71
aVHere's the last one: You're talking to somebody,
p72
aVand you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."
p73
aVBut really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.
p74
aVEach of these is about a relationship,
p75
aVand this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,
p76
aVyou can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.
p77
aVAnd so these lies are being used by people
p78
aVto create a buffer, like the butler used to do,
p79
aVbetween us and the connections to everybody else.
p80
aVBut they're very special. They use ambiguity
p81
aVthat comes from using technology. You don't know
p82
aVwhere I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.
p83
aVAnd they're aimed at protecting the relationships.
p84
aVThese aren't just people being jerks. These are people
p85
aVthat are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,
p86
aVor I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.
p87
aVOur relationship is still important.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,
p90
aVis a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't
p91
aVabout ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.
p92
aVLet me give you a very recent example,
p93
aVas in, like, last week.
p94
aVHere's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
p95
aVHere's one of his bestselling books.
p96
aVHere's a reviewer online, on Amazon.
p97
aVMy favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,
p98
aV"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."
p99
aVAnd of course, you might suspect
p100
aVthat Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.
p101
aVHe wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.
p104
aVWalt Whitman also did this back in the day,
p105
aVbefore there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet
p106
aVbecomes interesting when we get to scale,
p107
aVwhich is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.
p108
aVChinese Water Army refers to thousands of people
p109
aVin China that are paid small amounts of money
p110
aVto produce content. It could be reviews. It could be
p111
aVpropaganda. The government hires these people,
p112
aVcompanies hire them, all over the place.
p113
aVIn North America, we call this Astroturfing,
p114
aVand Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
p115
aVWe see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,
p116
aVeverything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,
p119
aVyou might think, wow, the Internet is really making us
p120
aVa deceptive species, especially when you think about
p121
aVthe Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.
p122
aVBut actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.
p123
aVNow, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,
p124
aVwhich I'm sure none of you have been in.
p125
aVI can assure you there's deception there.
p126
aVAnd let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you
p127
aVabout getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)
p128
aVLet's forget about that guy, too.
p129
aVLet's focus on the conversations between our friends
p130
aVand our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.
p131
aVThose are the conversations that really matter.
p132
aVWhat does technology do to deception with those folks?
p133
aa(lp134
VHere's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do
p135
aVare called diary studies, in which we ask people to record
p136
aVall of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,
p137
aVand what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place
p138
aVper conversation within a medium, and the finding
p139
aVthat we get that surprises people the most is that email
p140
aVis the most honest of those three media.
p141
aVAnd it really throws people for a loop because we think,
p142
aVwell, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?
p143
aVThe phone, in contrast, the most lies.
p144
aVAgain and again and again we see the phone is the device
p145
aVthat people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
p146
aVThis tends to be very different from what people expect.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat about résumés? We did a study in which we had
p149
aVpeople apply for a job, and they could apply for a job
p150
aVeither with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,
p151
aVwhich is a social networking site like Facebook,
p152
aVbut for professionals \u2014 involves the same information as a résumé.
p153
aVAnd what we found, to many people's surprise,
p154
aVwas that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest
p155
aVon the things that mattered to employers, like your
p156
aVresponsibilities or your skills at your previous job.
p157
aa(lp158
VHow about Facebook itself?
p159
aVYou know, we always think that hey, there are these
p160
aVidealized versions, people are just showing the best things
p161
aVthat happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.
p162
aVMy friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.
p163
aVWell, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.
p164
aVThey had four good friends of a person judge their personality.
p165
aVThen they had strangers, many strangers,
p166
aVjudge the person's personality just from Facebook,
p167
aVand what they found was those judgments of the personality
p168
aVwere pretty much identical, highly correlated,
p169
aVmeaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.
p170
aa(lp171
VAll right, well, what about online dating?
p172
aVI mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
p173
aVI'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter)
p174
aVAnd they would tell you about that guy that had no hair
p175
aVwhen he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.
p176
aVWell, we were really interested in it, and so what we did
p177
aVis we brought people, online daters, into the lab,
p178
aVand then we measured them. We got their height
p179
aVup against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight \u2014
p180
aVladies loved that \u2014 and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.
p181
aVAnd what we found was very, very interesting.
p182
aVHere's an example of the men and the height.
p183
aVAlong the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.
p184
aVAlong the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
p185
aVThat diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,
p186
aVthey were telling exactly the truth.
p187
aVNow, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
p188
aVWhat it means is all the guys were lying about their height.
p189
aVIn fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,
p190
aVwhat we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)
p191
aVYou get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".
p192
aVBut what's really important here is, look at all those dots.
p193
aVThey are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found
p194
aVwas 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie
p195
aVon one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.
p196
aVOne of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,
p197
aVa coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,
p198
aVgame over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied
p199
aVsubtly, not too much. They were constrained.
p200
aa(lp201
VWell, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact
p202
aVthat despite our intuitions, mine included,
p203
aVa lot of online communication, technologically-mediated
p204
aVcommunication, is more honest than face to face?
p205
aVThat really is strange. How do we explain this?
p206
aa(lp207
VWell, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
p208
aVIt's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
p209
aVIt's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,
p210
aVhundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,
p213
aVreally bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell
p214
aVif somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
p215
aVThat's really bad. Why is it so bad?
p216
aVWell it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.
p217
aVIf I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on
p218
aVwhen you're looking at somebody and you want to find out
p219
aVif they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?
p220
aVMost of you would say that one of the cues you look at
p221
aVis the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.
p222
aVAnd you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,
p223
aVone of the top cues is eyes. But the research
p224
aVover the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue
p225
aVto deception, which blew me away, and it's one of
p226
aVthe hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.
p227
aVThe eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.
p228
aVSome situations, yes \u2014 high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,
p229
aVtheir pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,
p230
aVbut not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.
p231
aVStrange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me
p232
aVdoesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,
p233
aVbut one important finding is that we lie for a reason.
p234
aVWe lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain
p235
aVor for somebody else's gain.
p236
aVSo there are some pathological liars, but they make up
p237
aVa tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.
p238
aVJust because people can't see us doesn't mean
p239
aVwe're going to necessarily lie.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut I think there's actually something much more
p242
aVinteresting and fundamental going on here. The next big
p243
aVthing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going
p244
aVway back in history to the origins of language.
p245
aVMost linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere
p246
aVbetween 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.
p247
aVA lot of humans have lived since then.
p248
aVWe've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves
p249
aVand saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,
p250
aVbut they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,
p251
aVthere's a lot of humans evolving speaking,
p252
aVabout 100 billion people in fact.
p253
aVWhat's important though is that writing only emerged
p254
aVabout 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that
p255
aVall the people before there was any writing,
p256
aVevery word that they ever said, every utterance
p257
aVdisappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.
p258
aVSo we've been evolving to talk in a way in which
p259
aVthere is no record. In fact, even the next big change
p260
aVto writing was only 500 years ago now,
p261
aVwith the printing press, which is very recent in our past,
p262
aVand literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,
p263
aVso even the people of the last two millennia,
p264
aVmost of the words they ever said \u2014 poof! \u2014 disappeared.
p265
aa(lp266
VLet's turn to now, the networked age.
p267
aVHow many of you have recorded something today?
p268
aVAnybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?
p269
aVIt looks like almost every single person here recorded something.
p270
aVIn this room, right now, we've probably recorded more
p271
aVthan almost all of human pre-ancient history.
p272
aVThat is crazy. We're entering this amazing period
p273
aVof flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak
p274
aVin a way in which our words disappear, but we're in
p275
aVan environment where we're recording everything.
p276
aVIn fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just
p277
aVwhat we write that will be recorded, everything we do
p278
aVwill be recorded.
p279
aVWhat does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?
p280
aVWell, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing
p281
aVI have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at
p282
aVall those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
p283
aVI can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
p284
aVYou remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were
p285
aVtalking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,
p286
aVthey have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of
p289
aVlooking at the language, is we paid people
p290
aVto write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.
p291
aVThe person never was at the James Hotel.
p292
aVThe other review is real. The person stayed there.
p293
aVNow, your task now is to decide
p294
aVwhich review is fake?
p295
aVI'll give you a moment to read through them.
p296
aVBut I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.
p297
aVRemember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.
p298
aVAll right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?
p299
aVAll right. Very good. About half.
p300
aVAnd how many of you think that B is?
p301
aVAll right. Slightly more for B.
p302
aVExcellent. Here's the answer.
p303
aVB is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)
p304
aVYou're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,
p305
aVit's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits
p306
aVwith the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here
p307
aVin Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.
p308
aVThose cold, hard winters, I love it.
p309
aa(lp310
VAll right, so why do I care about this?
p311
aVWell, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science
p312
aVis we can create computer algorithms that can analyze
p313
aVthe linguistic traces of deception.
p314
aVLet me highlight a couple of things here
p315
aVin the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think
p316
aVabout narrative. They make up a story:
p317
aVWho? And what happened? And that's what happened here.
p318
aVOur fake reviewers talked about who they were with
p319
aVand what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,
p320
aVway more than the people that actually stayed there.
p321
aVThey were inserting themselves into the hotel review,
p322
aVkind of trying to convince you they were there.
p323
aVIn contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,
p324
aVtheir bodies actually entered the physical space,
p325
aVthey talked a lot more about spatial information.
p326
aVThey said how big the bathroom was, or they said,
p327
aVyou know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
p330
aVOur computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate
p331
aVthan humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
p332
aVThis isn't a deception-detection machine to tell
p333
aVif your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.
p334
aVWe believe that every lie now, every type of lie \u2014
p335
aVfake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,
p336
aVyour girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging \u2014
p337
aVthose are all different lies. They're going to have
p338
aVdifferent patterns of language. But because everything's
p339
aVrecorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.
p342
aVIt's transformational. We're going to be able to learn
p343
aVso much more about human thought and expression,
p344
aVabout everything from love to attitudes,
p345
aVbecause everything is being recorded now, but
p346
aVwhat does it mean for the average citizen?
p347
aVWhat does it mean for us in our lives?
p348
aVWell, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,
p349
aVI believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
p350
aVMy outbox for email is massive,
p351
aVand I never look at it. I write all the time,
p352
aVbut I never look at my record, at my trace.
p353
aVAnd I think we're going to see a lot more of that,
p354
aVwhere we can reflect on who we are by looking at
p355
aVwhat we wrote, what we said, what we did.
p356
aa(lp357
VNow, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple
p358
aVof take-away things here.
p359
aVFirst, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
p360
aVNot only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,
p361
aVbut you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,
p362
aVand you're also leaving them around for me to analyze
p363
aVwith some computer algorithms.
p364
aVSo by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.
p365
aVBut when it comes to lying and what we want to do
p366
aVwith our lives, I think we can go back to
p367
aVDiogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned
p368
aVabout whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about
p369
aVbeing true to the self, and I think this is really important.
p370
aVNow, when you are about to say or do something,
p371
aVwe can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,
p372
aVpart of my personal record?
p373
aVBecause in the digital age we live in now,
p374
aVin the networked age, we are all leaving a record.
p375
aVThank you so much for your time,
p376
aVand good luck with your record. (Applause)
