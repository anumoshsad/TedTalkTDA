VMost of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do,
p4
aVwhether it's our job, family, school
p5
aVor anything else.
p6
aVI feel that way. I try my best.
p7
aVBut some time ago, I came to a realization
p8
aVthat I wasn't getting much better at the things I cared most about,
p9
aVwhether it was being a husband or a friend
p10
aVor a professional or teammate,
p11
aVand I wasn't improving much at those things
p12
aVeven though I was spending a lot of time
p13
aVworking hard at them.
p14
aVI've since realized from conversations I've had and from research
p15
aVthat this stagnation, despite hard work,
p16
aVturns out to be pretty common.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I'd like to share with you some insights into why that is
p19
aVand what we can all do about it.
p20
aVWhat I've learned is that the most effective people
p21
aVand teams in any domain
p22
aVdo something we can all emulate.
p23
aVThey go through life deliberately alternating between two zones:
p24
aVthe learning zone and the performance zone.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe learning zone is when our goal is to improve.
p27
aVThen we do activities designed for improvement,
p28
aVconcentrating on what we haven't mastered yet,
p29
aVwhich means we have to expect to make mistakes,
p30
aVknowing that we will learn from them.
p31
aVThat is very different from what we do when we're in our performance zone,
p32
aVwhich is when our goal is to do something as best as we can, to execute.
p33
aVThen we concentrate on what we have already mastered
p34
aVand we try to minimize mistakes.
p35
aa(lp36
VBoth of these zones should be part of our lives,
p37
aVbut being clear about when we want to be in each of them,
p38
aVwith what goal, focus and expectations,
p39
aVhelps us better perform and better improve.
p40
aVThe performance zone maximizes our immediate performance,
p41
aVwhile the learning zone maximizes our growth
p42
aVand our future performance.
p43
aVThe reason many of us don't improve much
p44
aVdespite our hard work
p45
aVis that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone.
p46
aVThis hinders our growth,
p47
aVand ironically, over the long term, also our performance.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo what does the learning zone look like?
p50
aVTake Demosthenes, a political leader
p51
aVand the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient Greece.
p52
aVTo become great, he didn't spend all his time
p53
aVjust being an orator or a lawyer,
p54
aVwhich would be his performance zone.
p55
aVBut instead, he did activities designed for improvement.
p56
aVOf course, he studied a lot.
p57
aVHe studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors,
p58
aVbut he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people,
p59
aVso he also studied great speeches
p60
aVand acting.
p61
aVTo get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder,
p62
aVhe practiced his speeches in front of a mirror,
p63
aVand he suspended a sword from the ceiling
p64
aVso that if he raised his shoulder,
p65
aVit would hurt.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VTo speak more clearly despite a lisp,
p70
aVhe went through his speeches with stones in his mouth.
p71
aVHe built an underground room
p72
aVwhere he could practice without interruptions
p73
aVand not disturb other people.
p74
aVAnd since courts at the time were very noisy,
p75
aVhe also practiced by the ocean,
p76
aVprojecting his voice above the roar of the waves.
p77
aa(lp78
VHis activities in the learning zone
p79
aVwere very different from his activities in court,
p80
aVhis performance zone.
p81
aVIn the learning zone,
p82
aVhe did what Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice.
p83
aVThis involves breaking down abilities into component skills,
p84
aVbeing clear about what subskill we're working to improve,
p85
aVlike keeping our shoulders down,
p86
aVgiving full concentration to a high level of challenge
p87
aVoutside our comfort zone,
p88
aVjust beyond what we can currently do,
p89
aVusing frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments,
p90
aVand ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach,
p91
aVbecause activities designed for improvement
p92
aVare domain-specific,
p93
aVand great teachers and coaches know what those activities are
p94
aVand can also give us expert feedback.
p95
aVIt is this type of practice in the learning zone
p96
aVwhich leads to substantial improvement,
p97
aVnot just time on task performing.
p98
aVFor example, research shows that after the first couple of years
p99
aVworking in a profession,
p100
aVperformance usually plateaus.
p101
aVThis has been shown to be true in teaching, general medicine,
p102
aVnursing and other fields,
p103
aVand it happens because once we think we have become good enough,
p104
aVadequate,
p105
aVthen we stop spending time in the learning zone.
p106
aVWe focus all our time on just doing our job,
p107
aVperforming,
p108
aVwhich turns out not to be a great way to improve.
p109
aVBut the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone
p110
aVdo continue to always improve.
p111
aVThe best salespeople at least once a week
p112
aVdo activities with the goal of improvement.
p113
aVThey read to extend their knowledge,
p114
aVconsult with colleagues or domain experts,
p115
aVtry out new strategies, solicit feedback and reflect.
p116
aVThe best chess players
p117
aVspend a lot of time not playing games of chess,
p118
aVwhich would be their performance zone,
p119
aVbut trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them.
p120
aVEach of us has probably spent many, many, many hours
p121
aVtyping on a computer
p122
aVwithout getting faster,
p123
aVbut if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day
p124
aVfully concentrating on typing 10 to 20 percent faster
p125
aVthan our current reliable speed,
p126
aVwe would get faster,
p127
aVespecially if we also identified what mistakes we're making
p128
aVand practiced typing those words.
p129
aVThat's deliberate practice.
p130
aa(lp131
VIn what other parts of our lives,
p132
aVperhaps that we care more about,
p133
aVare we working hard but not improving much
p134
aVbecause we're always in the performance zone?
p135
aVNow, this is not to say that the performance zone has no value.
p136
aVIt very much does.
p137
aVWhen I needed a knee surgery, I didn't tell the surgeon,
p138
aV"Poke around in there and focus on what you don't know."
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
V"We'll learn from your mistakes!"
p143
aVI looked for a surgeon who I felt would do a good job,
p144
aVand I wanted her to do a good job.
p145
aVBeing in the performance zone
p146
aVallows us to get things done as best as we can.
p147
aVIt can also be motivating,
p148
aVand it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next
p149
aVwhen we go back to the learning zone.
p150
aVSo the way to high performance
p151
aVis to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone,
p152
aVpurposefully building our skills in the learning zone,
p153
aVthen applying those skills in the performance zone.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhen Beyoncé is on tour,
p156
aVduring the concert, she's in her performance zone,
p157
aVbut every night when she gets back to the hotel room,
p158
aVshe goes right back into her learning zone.
p159
aVShe watches a video of the show that just ended.
p160
aVShe identifies opportunities for improvement,
p161
aVfor herself, her dancers and her camera staff.
p162
aVAnd the next morning,
p163
aVeveryone receives pages of notes with what to adjust,
p164
aVwhich they then work on during the day before the next performance.
p165
aVIt's a spiral
p166
aVto ever-increasing capabilities,
p167
aVbut we need to know when we seek to learn, and when we seek to perform,
p168
aVand while we want to spend time doing both,
p169
aVthe more time we spend in the learning zone,
p170
aVthe more we'll improve.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo how can we spend more time in the learning zone?
p173
aVFirst, we must believe and understand
p174
aVthat we can improve,
p175
aVwhat we call a growth mindset.
p176
aVSecond, we must want to improve at that particular skill.
p177
aVThere has to be a purpose we care about,
p178
aVbecause it takes time and effort.
p179
aVThird, we must have an idea about how to improve,
p180
aVwhat we can do to improve,
p181
aVnot how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager,
p182
aVperforming songs over and over again,
p183
aVbut doing deliberate practice.
p184
aVAnd fourth, we must be in a low-stakes situation,
p185
aVbecause if mistakes are to be expected,
p186
aVthen the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic,
p187
aVor even very significant.
p188
aVA tightrope walker doesn't practice new tricks without a net underneath,
p189
aVand an athlete wouldn't set out to first try a new move
p190
aVduring a championship match.
p191
aa(lp192
VOne reason that in our lives
p193
aVwe spend so much time in the performance zone
p194
aVis that our environments often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.
p195
aVWe create social risks for one another,
p196
aVeven in schools which are supposed to be all about learning,
p197
aVand I'm not talking about standardized tests.
p198
aVI mean that every minute of every day,
p199
aVmany students in elementary schools through colleges
p200
aVfeel that if they make a mistake, others will think less of them.
p201
aVNo wonder they're always stressed out
p202
aVand not taking the risks necessary for learning.
p203
aVBut they learn that mistakes are undesirable
p204
aVinadvertently
p205
aVwhen teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers
p206
aVand reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them
p207
aVto learn from them,
p208
aVor when we look for narrow responses
p209
aVrather than encourage more exploratory thinking
p210
aVthat we can all learn from.
p211
aVWhen all homework or student work has a number or a letter on it,
p212
aVand counts towards a final grade,
p213
aVrather than being used for practice, mistakes, feedback and revision,
p214
aVwe send the message that school is a performance zone.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe same is true in our workplaces.
p217
aVIn the companies I consult with, I often see flawless execution cultures
p218
aVwhich leaders foster to encourage great work.
p219
aVBut that leads employees to stay within what they know
p220
aVand not try new things,
p221
aVso companies struggle to innovate and improve,
p222
aVand they fall behind.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe can create more spaces for growth
p225
aVby starting conversations with one another
p226
aVabout when we want to be in each zone.
p227
aVWhat do we want to get better at and how?
p228
aVAnd when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes?
p229
aVThat way, we gain clarity about what success is,
p230
aVwhen, and how to best support one another.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut what if we find ourselves in a chronic high-stakes setting
p233
aVand we feel we can't start those conversations yet?
p234
aVThen here are three things that we can still do as individuals.
p235
aVFirst, we can create low-stakes islands in an otherwise high-stakes sea.
p236
aVThese are spaces where mistakes have little consequence.
p237
aVFor example, we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague
p238
aVwith whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations
p239
aVor even role-play.
p240
aVOr we can ask for feedback-oriented meetings as projects progress.
p241
aVOr we can set aside time to read or watch videos or take online courses.
p242
aVThose are just some examples.
p243
aVSecond, we can execute and perform as we're expected,
p244
aVbut then reflect on what we could do better next time,
p245
aVlike Beyoncé does,
p246
aVand we can observe and emulate experts.
p247
aVThe observation, reflection and adjustment is a learning zone.
p248
aVAnd finally, we can lead
p249
aVand lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at,
p250
aVby asking questions about what we don't know,
p251
aVby soliciting feedback and by sharing our mistakes
p252
aVand what we've learned from them,
p253
aVso that others can feel safe to do the same.
p254
aa(lp255
VReal confidence is about modeling ongoing learning.
p256
aVWhat if, instead of spending our lives doing, doing, doing,
p257
aVperforming, performing, performing,
p258
aVwe spent more time exploring,
p259
aVasking,
p260
aVlistening,
p261
aVexperimenting, reflecting,
p262
aVstriving and becoming?
p263
aVWhat if we each always had something
p264
aVwe were working to improve?
p265
aVWhat if we created more low-stakes islands
p266
aVand waters?
p267
aVAnd what if we got clear,
p268
aVwithin ourselves and with our teammates,
p269
aVabout when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform,
p270
aVso that our efforts can become more consequential,
p271
aVour improvement never-ending
p272
aVand our best even better?
p273
aa(lp274
