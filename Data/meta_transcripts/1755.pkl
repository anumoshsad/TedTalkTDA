(lp3
VSo I was trained to become a gymnast
p4
aVfor two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
p5
aVWhen I was in the first grade, the government
p6
aVwanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,
p7
aVall expenses paid.
p8
aVBut my tiger mother said, "No."
p9
aVMy parents wanted me to become
p10
aVan engineer like them.
p11
aVAfter surviving the Cultural Revolution,
p12
aVthey firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:
p13
aVa safe and well-paid job.
p14
aVIt is not important if I like the job or not.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
p17
aVThat is me playing my imaginary piano.
p18
aVAn opera singer must start training young
p19
aVto learn acrobatics,
p20
aVso I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
p21
aVI even wrote to the school principal
p22
aVand the host of a radio show.
p23
aVBut no adults liked the idea.
p24
aVNo adults believed I was serious.
p25
aVOnly my friends supported me, but they were kids,
p26
aVjust as powerless as I was.
p27
aVSo at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
p28
aVMy dream would never come true.
p29
aVI was afraid that for the rest of my life
p30
aVsome second-class happiness
p31
aVwould be the best I could hope for.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut that's so unfair.
p34
aVSo I was determined to find another calling.
p35
aVNobody around to teach me? Fine.
p36
aVI turned to books.
p37
aa(lp38
VI satisfied my hunger for parental advice
p39
aVfrom this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]
p40
aa(lp41
VI found my role model of an independent woman
p42
aVwhen Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.
p47
aa(lp48
V["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]
p49
aa(lp50
VI came to the U.S. in 1995,
p51
aVso which books did I read here first?
p52
aVBooks banned in China, of course.
p53
aV"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
p54
aVThat's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
p55
aVThe Bible is interesting, but strange.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVThat's a topic for a different day.
p58
aVBut the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:
p59
aV"You shall honor your father and mother."
p60
aV"Honor," I said. "That's so different,
p61
aVand better, than obey."
p62
aVSo it becomes my tool to climb out
p63
aVof this Confucian guilt trap
p64
aVand to restart my relationship with my parents.
p65
aa(lp66
VEncountering a new culture also started my habit
p67
aVof comparative reading.
p68
aVIt offers many insights.
p69
aVFor example, I found this map out of place at first
p70
aVbecause this is what Chinese students grew up with.
p71
aVIt had never occurred to me,
p72
aVChina doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
p73
aVA map actually carries somebody's view.
p74
aVComparative reading actually is nothing new.
p75
aVIt's a standard practice in the academic world.
p76
aVThere are even research fields
p77
aVsuch as comparative religion and comparative literature.
p78
aa(lp79
VCompare and contrast gives scholars
p80
aVa more complete understanding of a topic.
p81
aVSo I thought, well, if comparative reading
p82
aVworks for research, why not do it in daily life too?
p83
aVSo I started reading books in pairs.
p84
aVSo they can be about people \u2014
p85
aV["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] \u2014
p86
aVwho are involved in the same event,
p87
aVor friends with shared experiences.
p88
aV["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]
p89
aVI also compare the same stories in different genres \u2014 (Laughter)
p90
aV[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] \u2014
p91
aVor similar stories from different cultures,
p92
aVas Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]
p93
aVFor example, both the Christ and the Buddha
p94
aVwent through three temptations.
p95
aVFor the Christ, the temptations
p96
aVare economic, political and spiritual.
p97
aVFor the Buddha, they are all psychological:
p98
aVlust, fear and social duty \u2014 interesting.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo if you know a foreign language, it's also fun
p101
aVto read your favorite books in two languages.
p102
aV["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]
p103
aVInstead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
p104
aVFor example, it's through translation that I realized
p105
aV"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!
p106
aV"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VBooks have given me a magic portal to connect with people
p110
aVof the past and the present.
p111
aVI know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
p112
aVHaving a dream shattered really is nothing
p113
aVcompared to what many others have suffered.
p114
aVI have come to believe that coming true
p115
aVis not the only purpose of a dream.
p116
aVIts most important purpose is to get us in touch
p117
aVwith where dreams come from,
p118
aVwhere passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
p119
aVEven a shattered dream can do that for you.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo because of books, I'm here today,
p122
aVhappy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,
p123
aVmost of the time.
p124
aVSo may books be always with you.
p125
aa(lp126
