VTo give me an idea of how many of you here
p4
aVmay find what I'm about to tell you
p5
aVof practical value,
p6
aVlet me ask you please to raise your hands:
p7
aVWho here is either over 65 years old
p8
aVor hopes to live past age 65
p9
aVor has parents or grandparents who did live
p10
aVor have lived past 65,
p11
aVraise your hands please. (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VOkay. You are the people to whom my talk
p14
aVwill be of practical value. (Laughter)
p15
aVThe rest of you
p16
aVwon't find my talk personally relevant,
p17
aVbut I think that you will still find the subject
p18
aVfascinating.
p19
aa(lp20
VI'm going to talk about growing older
p21
aVin traditional societies.
p22
aVThis subject constitutes just one chapter
p23
aVof my latest book, which compares
p24
aVtraditional, small, tribal societies
p25
aVwith our large, modern societies,
p26
aVwith respect to many topics
p27
aVsuch as bringing up children,
p28
aVgrowing older, health, dealing with danger,
p29
aVsettling disputes, religion
p30
aVand speaking more than one language.
p31
aa(lp32
VThose tribal societies, which constituted
p33
aVall human societies for most of human history,
p34
aVare far more diverse than are our modern,
p35
aVrecent, big societies.
p36
aVAll big societies that have governments,
p37
aVand where most people are strangers to each other,
p38
aVare inevitably similar to each other
p39
aVand different from tribal societies.
p40
aVTribes constitute thousands of natural experiments
p41
aVin how to run a human society.
p42
aVThey constitute experiments from which we ourselves
p43
aVmay be able to learn.
p44
aVTribal societies shouldn't be scorned
p45
aVas primitive and miserable,
p46
aVbut also they shouldn't be romanticized
p47
aVas happy and peaceful.
p48
aVWhen we learn of tribal practices,
p49
aVsome of them will horrify us,
p50
aVbut there are other tribal practices which,
p51
aVwhen we hear about them,
p52
aVwe may admire and envy
p53
aVand wonder whether we could adopt those practices
p54
aVourselves.
p55
aa(lp56
VMost old people in the U.S. end up living
p57
aVseparately from their children
p58
aVand from most of their friends
p59
aVof their earlier years,
p60
aVand often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly,
p61
aVwhereas in traditional societies,
p62
aVolder people instead live out their lives
p63
aVamong their children, their other relatives,
p64
aVand their lifelong friends.
p65
aVNevertheless, the treatment of the elderly
p66
aVvaries enormously among traditional societies,
p67
aVfrom much worse to much better
p68
aVthan in our modern societies.
p69
aa(lp70
VAt the worst extreme, many traditional societies
p71
aVget rid of their elderly
p72
aVin one of four increasingly direct ways:
p73
aVby neglecting their elderly
p74
aVand not feeding or cleaning them until they die,
p75
aVor by abandoning them when the group moves,
p76
aVor by encouraging older people to commit suicide,
p77
aVor by killing older people.
p78
aVIn which tribal societies do children
p79
aVabandon or kill their parents?
p80
aVIt happens mainly under two conditions.
p81
aVOne is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies
p82
aVthat often shift camp
p83
aVand that are physically incapable
p84
aVof transporting old people who can't walk
p85
aVwhen the able-bodied younger people already
p86
aVhave to carry their young children
p87
aVand all their physical possessions.
p88
aVThe other condition is in societies
p89
aVliving in marginal or fluctuating environments,
p90
aVsuch as the Arctic or deserts,
p91
aVwhere there are periodic food shortages,
p92
aVand occasionally there just isn't enough food
p93
aVto keep everyone alive.
p94
aVWhatever food is available has to be reserved
p95
aVfor able-bodied adults and for children.
p96
aVTo us Americans, it sounds horrible
p97
aVto think of abandoning or killing
p98
aVyour own sick wife or husband
p99
aVor elderly mother or father,
p100
aVbut what could those traditional societies
p101
aVdo differently?
p102
aVThey face a cruel situation of no choice.
p103
aVTheir old people had to do it to their own parents,
p104
aVand the old people know
p105
aVwhat now is going to happen to them.
p106
aa(lp107
VAt the opposite extreme
p108
aVin treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,
p109
aVare the New Guinea farming societies
p110
aVwhere I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past 50 years,
p111
aVand most other sedentary traditional societies
p112
aVaround the world.
p113
aVIn those societies, older people are cared for.
p114
aVThey are fed. They remain valuable.
p115
aVAnd they continue to live in the same hut
p116
aVor else in a nearby hut near their children,
p117
aVrelatives and lifelong friends.
p118
aa(lp119
VThere are two main sets of reasons for this variation
p120
aVamong societies in their treatment
p121
aVof old people.
p122
aVThe variation depends especially
p123
aVon the usefulness of old people
p124
aVand on the society's values.
p125
aa(lp126
VFirst, as regards usefulness,
p127
aVolder people continue to perform useful services.
p128
aVOne use of older people in traditional societies
p129
aVis that they often are still effective
p130
aVat producing food.
p131
aVAnother traditional usefulness of older people
p132
aVis that they are capable of babysitting
p133
aVtheir grandchildren,
p134
aVthereby freeing up their own adult children,
p135
aVthe parents of those grandchildren,
p136
aVto go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren.
p137
aVStill another traditional value of older people
p138
aVis in making tools, weapons, baskets,
p139
aVpots and textiles.
p140
aVIn fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.
p141
aVOlder people usually are the leaders
p142
aVof traditional societies,
p143
aVand the people most knowledgeable about politics,
p144
aVmedicine, religion, songs and dances.
p145
aa(lp146
VFinally, older people in traditional societies
p147
aVhave a huge significance that would never occur
p148
aVto us in our modern, literate societies,
p149
aVwhere our sources of information are books
p150
aVand the Internet.
p151
aVIn contrast, in traditional societies without writing,
p152
aVolder people are the repositories of information.
p153
aVIt's their knowledge that spells the difference
p154
aVbetween survival and death for their whole society
p155
aVin a time of crisis caused by rare events
p156
aVfor which only the oldest people alive
p157
aVhave had experience.
p158
aVThose, then, are the ways in which older people
p159
aVare useful in traditional societies.
p160
aVTheir usefulness varies and contributes
p161
aVto variation in the society's treatment
p162
aVof the elderly.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe other set of reasons for variation
p165
aVin the treatment of the elderly is
p166
aVthe society's cultural values.
p167
aVFor example, there's particular emphasis
p168
aVon respect for the elderly in East Asia,
p169
aVassociated with Confucius' doctrine
p170
aVof filial piety, which means obedience,
p171
aVrespect and support for elderly parents.
p172
aVCultural values that emphasize respect for older people
p173
aVcontrast with the low status of the elderly
p174
aVin the U.S.
p175
aVOlder Americans are at a big disadvantage
p176
aVin job applications.
p177
aVThey're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.
p178
aVOur hospitals have an explicit policy
p179
aVcalled age-based allocation of healthcare resources.
p180
aVThat sinister expression means that
p181
aVif hospital resources are limited,
p182
aVfor example if only one donor heart
p183
aVbecomes available for transplant,
p184
aVor if a surgeon has time to operate
p185
aVon only a certain number of patients,
p186
aVAmerican hospitals have an explicit policy
p187
aVof giving preference to younger patients
p188
aVover older patients
p189
aVon the grounds that younger patients are considered
p190
aVmore valuable to society
p191
aVbecause they have more years of life ahead of them,
p192
aVeven though the younger patients have fewer years
p193
aVof valuable life experience behind them.
p194
aVThere are several reasons for this low status
p195
aVof the elderly in the U.S.
p196
aVOne is our Protestant work ethic
p197
aVwhich places high value on work,
p198
aVso older people who are no longer working
p199
aVaren't respected.
p200
aVAnother reason is our American emphasis
p201
aVon the virtues of self-reliance and independence,
p202
aVso we instinctively look down on older people
p203
aVwho are no longer self-reliant and independent.
p204
aVStill a third reason is our American cult of youth,
p205
aVwhich shows up even in our advertisements.
p206
aVAds for Coca-Cola and beer always depict
p207
aVsmiling young people,
p208
aVeven though old as well as young people
p209
aVbuy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.
p210
aVJust think, what's the last time you saw
p211
aVa Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people
p212
aV85 years old? Never.
p213
aVInstead, the only American ads
p214
aVfeaturing white-haired old people
p215
aVare ads for retirement homes and pension planning.
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, what has changed in the status
p218
aVof the elderly today
p219
aVcompared to their status in traditional societies?
p220
aVThere have been a few changes for the better
p221
aVand more changes for the worse.
p222
aVBig changes for the better
p223
aVinclude the fact that today we enjoy
p224
aVmuch longer lives,
p225
aVmuch better health in our old age,
p226
aVand much better recreational opportunities.
p227
aVAnother change for the better is that we now have
p228
aVspecialized retirement facilities
p229
aVand programs to take care of old people.
p230
aVChanges for the worse begin with the cruel reality
p231
aVthat we now have
p232
aVmore old people and fewer young people
p233
aVthan at any time in the past.
p234
aVThat means that all those old people
p235
aVare more of a burden on the few young people,
p236
aVand that each old person has less individual value.
p237
aVAnother big change for the worse in the status of the elderly
p238
aVis the breaking of social ties with age,
p239
aVbecause older people, their children,
p240
aVand their friends,
p241
aVall move and scatter independently of each other
p242
aVmany times during their lives.
p243
aVWe Americans move on the average
p244
aVevery five years.
p245
aVHence our older people are likely
p246
aVto end up living distant from their children
p247
aVand the friends of their youth.
p248
aVYet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly
p249
aVis formal retirement from the workforce,
p250
aVcarrying with it a loss of work friendships
p251
aVand a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.
p252
aVPerhaps the biggest change for the worse
p253
aVis that our elderly are objectively
p254
aVless useful than in traditional societies.
p255
aVWidespread literacy means that they are no longer
p256
aVuseful as repositories of knowledge.
p257
aVWhen we want some information,
p258
aVwe look it up in a book or we Google it
p259
aVinstead of finding some old person to ask.
p260
aVThe slow pace of technological change
p261
aVin traditional societies
p262
aVmeans that what someone learns there as a child
p263
aVis still useful when that person is old,
p264
aVbut the rapid pace of technological change today
p265
aVmeans that what we learn as children
p266
aVis no longer useful 60 years later.
p267
aVAnd conversely, we older people are not fluent
p268
aVin the technologies essential for surviving
p269
aVin modern society.
p270
aVFor example, as a 15-year-old,
p271
aVI was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers
p272
aVbecause I had memorized the multiplication tables
p273
aVand I know how to use logarithms
p274
aVand I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.
p275
aVToday, though, those skills are utterly useless
p276
aVbecause any idiot
p277
aVcan now multiply eight-digit numbers
p278
aVaccurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.
p279
aVConversely, I at age 75
p280
aVam incompetent at skills
p281
aVessential for everyday life.
p282
aVMy family's first TV set in 1948
p283
aVhad only three knobs that I quickly mastered:
p284
aVan on-off switch, a volume knob,
p285
aVand a channel selector knob.
p286
aVToday, just to watch a program
p287
aVon the TV set in my own house,
p288
aVI have to operate a 41-button TV remote
p289
aVthat utterly defeats me.
p290
aVI have to telephone my 25-year-old sons
p291
aVand ask them to talk me through it
p292
aVwhile I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhat can we do to improve the lives of the elderly
p295
aVin the U.S., and to make better use of their value?
p296
aVThat's a huge problem.
p297
aVIn my remaining four minutes today,
p298
aVI can offer just a few suggestions.
p299
aVOne value of older people is that they are
p300
aVincreasingly useful as grandparents
p301
aVfor offering high-quality childcare
p302
aVto their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,
p303
aVas more young women enter the workforce
p304
aVand as fewer young parents of either gender
p305
aVstay home as full-time caretakers of their children.
p306
aVCompared to the usual alternatives
p307
aVof paid babysitters and day care centers,
p308
aVgrandparents offer superior, motivated,
p309
aVexperienced child care.
p310
aVThey've already gained experience from raising their own children.
p311
aVThey usually love their grandchildren,
p312
aVand are eager to spend time with them.
p313
aVUnlike other caregivers,
p314
aVgrandparents don't quit their job
p315
aVbecause they found another job with higher pay
p316
aVlooking after another baby.
p317
aVA second value of older people is paradoxically
p318
aVrelated to their loss of value
p319
aVas a result of changing world conditions and technology.
p320
aVAt the same time, older people have gained
p321
aVin value today precisely because
p322
aVof their unique experience of living conditions
p323
aVthat have now become rare
p324
aVbecause of rapid change, but that could come back.
p325
aVFor example, only Americans now in their 70s
p326
aVor older today can remember
p327
aVthe experience of living through a great depression,
p328
aVthe experience of living through a world war,
p329
aVand agonizing whether or not
p330
aVdropping atomic bombs would be more horrible
p331
aVthan the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs.
p332
aVMost of our current voters and politicians
p333
aVhave no personal experience of any of those things,
p334
aVbut millions of older Americans do.
p335
aVUnfortunately, all of those terrible situations
p336
aVcould come back.
p337
aVEven if they don't come back,
p338
aVwe have to be able to plan for them
p339
aVon the basis of the experience of what they were like.
p340
aVOlder people have that experience.
p341
aVYounger people don't.
p342
aa(lp343
VThe remaining value of older people
p344
aVthat I'll mention involves recognizing that
p345
aVwhile there are many things that older people
p346
aVcan no longer do,
p347
aVthere are other things that they can do
p348
aVbetter than younger people.
p349
aVA challenge for society is  to make use of those things
p350
aVthat older people are better at doing.
p351
aVSome abilities, of course, decrease with age.
p352
aVThose include abilities at tasks
p353
aVrequiring physical strength and stamina,
p354
aVambition, and the power of novel reasoning
p355
aVin a circumscribed situation,
p356
aVsuch as figuring out the structure of DNA,
p357
aVbest left to scientists under the age of 30.
p358
aVConversely, valuable attributes
p359
aVthat increase with age include experience,
p360
aVunderstanding of people and human relationships,
p361
aVability to help other people
p362
aVwithout your own ego getting in the way,
p363
aVand interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,
p364
aVsuch as economics and comparative history,
p365
aVbest left to scholars over the age of 60.
p366
aVHence older people are much better than younger people
p367
aVat supervising, administering, advising,
p368
aVstrategizing, teaching, synthesizing,
p369
aVand devising long-term plans.
p370
aVI've seen this value of older people
p371
aVwith so many of my friends in their 60s,
p372
aV70s, 80s and 90s,
p373
aVwho are still active as investment managers,
p374
aVfarmers, lawyers and doctors.
p375
aVIn short, many traditional societies
p376
aVmake better use of their elderly
p377
aVand give their elderly more satisfying lives
p378
aVthan we do in modern, big societies.
p379
aa(lp380
VParadoxically nowadays,
p381
aVwhen we have more elderly people than ever before,
p382
aVliving healthier lives and with better medical care
p383
aVthan ever before,
p384
aVold age is in some respects more miserable
p385
aVthan ever before.
p386
aVThe lives of the elderly are widely recognized
p387
aVas constituting a disaster area
p388
aVof modern American society.
p389
aVWe can surely do better by learning
p390
aVfrom the lives of the elderly
p391
aVin traditional societies.
p392
aVBut what's true of the lives of the elderly
p393
aVin traditional societies
p394
aVis true of many other features
p395
aVof traditional societies as well.
p396
aVOf course, I'm not advocating that we all give up
p397
aVagriculture and metal tools
p398
aVand return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
p399
aVThere are many obvious respects
p400
aVin which our lives today are far happier
p401
aVthan those in small, traditional societies.
p402
aVTo mention just a few examples,
p403
aVour lives are longer, materially much richer,
p404
aVand less plagued by violence
p405
aVthan are the lives of people in traditional societies.
p406
aVBut there are also things to be admired
p407
aVabout people in traditional societies,
p408
aVand perhaps to be learned from them.
p409
aVTheir lives are usually socially much richer
p410
aVthan our lives,
p411
aValthough materially poorer.
p412
aVTheir children are more self-confident,
p413
aVmore independent, and more socially skilled
p414
aVthan are our children.
p415
aVThey think more realistically about dangers than we do.
p416
aVThey almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,
p417
aVstroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases
p418
aVthat will be the causes of death of almost
p419
aVall of us in this room today.
p420
aVFeatures of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases,
p421
aVand features of the traditional lifestyle
p422
aVprotect us against them.
p423
aa(lp424
VThose are just some examples of what we can learn
p425
aVfrom traditional societies.
p426
aVI hope that you will find it as fascinating
p427
aVto read about traditional societies
p428
aVas I found it to live in those societies.
