VI'd like you all
p4
aVto ask yourselves a question
p5
aVwhich you may never have asked yourselves before:
p6
aVWhat is possible with the human voice?
p7
aVWhat is possible with the human voice?
p8
aV(Beatboxing)
p9
aV\u266a Ooh baby \u266a
p10
aV\u266a baby \u266a
p11
aV\u266a baby \u266a
p12
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Baby crying)
p13
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Baby crying)
p14
aV\u266a baby \u266a (Cat meowing)
p15
aV(Dog barking)
p16
aVYeah.
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aV(Boomerang noises)
p19
aVIt was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah.
p20
aVAs you can probably well imagine,
p21
aVI was a strange child.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVBecause the thing is, I was constantly trying
p24
aVto extend my repertoire of noises to be
p25
aVthe very maximum that it could be.
p26
aVI was constantly experimenting with these noises.
p27
aVAnd I'm still on that mission.
p28
aVI'm still trying to find every noise
p29
aVthat I can possibly make.
p30
aVAnd the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now,
p31
aVand I know that there's some noises
p32
aVI'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in
p33
aVby my physical body, and there's things it can't do.
p34
aVAnd there's things that no one's voice can do.
p35
aVFor example, no one can do two notes at the same time.
p36
aVYou can do two-tone singing,
p37
aVwhich monks can do, which is like...
p38
aV(Two-tone singing)
p39
aVBut that's cheating.
p40
aVAnd it hurts your throat.
p41
aVSo there's things you can't do, and these limitations
p42
aVon the human voice have always really annoyed me,
p43
aVbecause beatbox is the best way of getting
p44
aVmusical ideas out of your head and into the world,
p45
aVbut they're sketches at best,
p46
aVwhich is what's annoyed me.
p47
aVIf only, if only there was a way
p48
aVfor these ideas to come out unimpeded
p49
aVby the restrictions which my body gives it.
p50
aVSo I've been working with these guys,
p51
aVand we've made a machine.
p52
aVWe've made a system which is basically
p53
aVa live production machine,
p54
aVa real-time music production machine,
p55
aVand it enables me to, using nothing but my voice,
p56
aVcreate music in real time as I hear it in my head
p57
aVunimpeded by any physical restrictions
p58
aVthat my body might place on me.
p59
aVAnd I'm going to show you what it can do.
p60
aVAnd before I start making noises with it,
p61
aVand using it to manipulate my voice,
p62
aVI want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear
p63
aVis being made by my voice.
p64
aVThis system has \u2014
p65
aVthank you, beautiful assistant \u2014
p66
aVthis system has no sounds in it itself
p67
aVuntil I start putting sounds in it,
p68
aVso there's no prerecorded samples of any kind.
p69
aVSo once this thing really gets going,
p70
aVand it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it,
p71
aVit becomes not obvious that it is the human voice,
p72
aVbut it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit
p73
aVand start nice and simple.
p74
aVSo the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice.
p75
aVHow do I get around the problem
p76
aVof really wanting to have as many different voices
p77
aVgoing on at the same time.
p78
aVThe simplest way to do it is something like this.
p79
aV(Beatboxing)
p80
aVBy dancing. It's like this.
p81
aV(Music)
p82
aVThanks.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVSo that's probably the easiest way.
p85
aVBut if you want to do something a little bit more immediate,
p86
aVsomething that you can't achieve with live looping,
p87
aVthere's other ways to layer your voice up.
p88
aVThere's things like pitch-shifting,
p89
aVwhich are awesome,
p90
aVand I'm going to show you now what that sounds like.
p91
aVSo I'm going to start another beat for you, like this.
p92
aV(Beatboxing)
p93
aVThere's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start,
p94
aVbecause it's just fun, so
p95
aVyou can clap along if you want.
p96
aVYou don't have to. It's fine. Check it out.
p97
aVI'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
p98
aV(Music)
p99
aVAnd now, a rockabilly guitar.
p100
aVWhich is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p101
aVThanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?
p102
aVIs that possible? Yes, it is,
p103
aVby recording myself like this.
p104
aV(Organ sound)
p105
aVAnd now I have that, I have that recorded.
p106
aVAssign it to a keyboard.
p107
aV(Music)
p108
aVSo that's cool.
p109
aV(Applause)
p110
aVBut what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
p111
aVImpossible, you say. No.
p112
aVIt is possible, and you can do it very simply
p113
aVusing this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out.
p114
aV(Music)
p115
aVSo every noise you can hear there is my voice.
p116
aVI didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
p117
aVThere's no samples. There's no synthesizers.
p118
aVThat is literally all my voice being manipulated,
p119
aVand when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you,
p120
aVwhat's the point?
p121
aVWhy do this? (Laughter)
p122
aVBecause it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,
p123
aVI suppose, is the easy answer.
p124
aVBut in actual fact, I haven't made this machine
p125
aVso that I can emulate things that already exist.
p126
aVI've made this so that I can make
p127
aVany noise that I can imagine.
p128
aVSo with your permission, I'm going to do
p129
aVsome things that are in my mind,
p130
aVand I hope you enjoy them,
p131
aVbecause they're rather unusual,
p132
aVespecially when you're doing things which are
p133
aVas unusual as this, it can be hard to believe
p134
aVthat it is all my voice, you see.
p135
aV(Voice effects)
p136
aV(Music)
p137
aVLike this.
p138
aV(Music)
p139
aVSo, loosely defined,
p140
aVthat is what's possible with the human voice.
p141
aVThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
