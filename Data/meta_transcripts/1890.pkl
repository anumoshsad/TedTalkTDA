VI'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,
p4
aVand so just before I get going,
p5
aVI wanted to tell you as a South African
p6
aVthat one of the men who has inspired me most
p7
aVpassed away a few hours ago.
p8
aVNelson Mandela has come to the end
p9
aVof his long walk to freedom.
p10
aVAnd so this talk is going to be for him.
p11
aa(lp12
VI grew up in wonder.
p13
aVI grew up amongst those animals.
p14
aVI grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa
p15
aVat a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.
p16
aVIt's a place where my family has been
p17
aVin the safari business for four generations.
p18
aVNow for as long as I can remember,
p19
aVmy job has been to take people out into nature,
p20
aVand so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today
p21
aVto have the opportunity
p22
aVto bring some of my experiences out in nature
p23
aVin to this gathering.
p24
aVAfrica is a place
p25
aVwhere people still sit under starlit skies
p26
aVand around campfires and tell stories,
p27
aVand so what I have to share with you today
p28
aVis the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,
p29
aVstories about heroes of heart.
p30
aVNow my stories are not the stories
p31
aVthat you'll hear on the news,
p32
aVand while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,
p33
aVI also know it to be a place
p34
aVwhere people, animals and ecosystems
p35
aVteach us about a more interconnected world.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen I was nine years old,
p38
aVPresident Mandela came to stay with my family.
p39
aVHe had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration,
p40
aVand was in a period of readjustment
p41
aVto his sudden global icon status.
p42
aVMembers of the African National Congress
p43
aVthought that in the bush
p44
aVhe would have time to rest and recuperate
p45
aVaway from the public eye,
p46
aVand it's true that lions tend to be
p47
aVa very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVBut it was a defining time for me as a young boy.
p50
aVI would take him breakfast in bed,
p51
aVand then, in an old track suit and slippers,
p52
aVhe would go for a walk around the garden.
p53
aVAt night, I would sit with my family
p54
aVaround the snowy, bunny-eared TV,
p55
aVand watch images of that same
p56
aVquiet man from the garden
p57
aVsurrounded by hundreds and thousands of people
p58
aVas scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.
p59
aVHe was bringing peace
p60
aVto a divided and violent South Africa,
p61
aVone man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.
p62
aVMandela said often that the gift of prison
p63
aVwas the ability to go within and to think,
p64
aVto create in himself
p65
aVthe things he most wanted for South Africa:
p66
aVpeace, reconciliation, harmony.
p67
aVThrough this act of immense open-heartedness,
p68
aVhe was to become the embodiment
p69
aVof what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."
p70
aVUbuntu: I am because of you.
p71
aVOr, people are not people
p72
aVwithout other people.
p73
aVIt's not a new idea or value
p74
aVbut it's one that I certainly think at these times
p75
aVis worth building on.
p76
aVIn fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa,
p77
aVwe get to experience the deepest parts
p78
aVof our own humanity
p79
aVthrough our interactions with others.
p80
aVUbuntu is at play right now.
p81
aVYou are holding a space for me
p82
aVto express the deepest truth of who I am.
p83
aVWithout you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,
p84
aVand I spent a lot of time last week doing that,
p85
aVand it's not the same as this.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VIf Mandela was the national and international embodiment,
p89
aVthen the man who taught me the most
p90
aVabout this value personally was this man,
p91
aVSolly Mhlongo.
p92
aVSolly was born under a tree
p93
aV60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.
p94
aVHe would never have a lot of money,
p95
aVbut he was to be
p96
aVone of the richest men I would ever meet.
p97
aVSolly grew up tending to his father's cattle.
p98
aVNow, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle,
p99
aVbut it makes for über-resourcefulness.
p100
aVThe first job that he ever got in the safari business
p101
aVwas fixing the safari trucks.
p102
aVWhere he had learned to do that out in the bush
p103
aVI have no idea, but he could do it.
p104
aVHe then moved across into what we called
p105
aVthe habitat team.
p106
aVThese were the people on the reserve
p107
aVwho were responsible for its well-being.
p108
aVHe fixed roads, he mended wetlands,
p109
aVhe did some anti-poaching.
p110
aVAnd then one day we were out together,
p111
aVand he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked.
p112
aVAnd it was an old track,
p113
aVbut for fun he turned and he began to follow it,
p114
aVand I tell you, I could tell by the speed
p115
aVat which he moved on those pad marks
p116
aVthat this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.
p117
aVIf you drove past Solly
p118
aVsomewhere out on the reserve,
p119
aVyou look up in your rearview mirror,
p120
aVyou'd see he'd stopped the car
p121
aV20, 50 meters down the road
p122
aVjust in case you need help with something.
p123
aVThe only accusation I ever heard leveled at him
p124
aVwas when one of our clients said,
p125
aV"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VWhen I started professionally guiding people
p129
aVout into this environment,
p130
aVSolly was my tracker.
p131
aVWe worked together as a team.
p132
aVAnd the first guests we ever got
p133
aVwere a philanthropy group from your East Coast,
p134
aVand they said to Solly, on the side, they said,
p135
aV"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,
p136
aVwe want to see where you live."
p137
aVSo we took them up to his house,
p138
aVand this visit of the philanthropist to his house
p139
aVcoincided with a time when Solly's wife,
p140
aVwho was learning English,
p141
aVwas going through a phase where she would open the door
p142
aVby saying, "Hello, I love you.
p143
aVWelcome, I love you." (Laughter)
p144
aVAnd there was something so beautifully African
p145
aVabout it to me, this small house
p146
aVwith a huge heart in it.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow on the day that Solly saved my life,
p149
aVhe was already my hero.
p150
aVIt was a hot day,
p151
aVand we found ourselves down by the river.
p152
aVBecause of the heat, I took my shoes off,
p153
aVand I rolled up my pants,
p154
aVand I walked into the water.
p155
aVSolly remained on the bank.
p156
aVThe water was clear running over sand,
p157
aVand we turned and we began to make our way upstream.
p158
aVAnd a few meters ahead of us,
p159
aVthere was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank,
p160
aVand its branches were touching the water,
p161
aVand it was shadowy.
p162
aVAnd if had been a horror movie,
p163
aVpeople in the audience would have started saying,
p164
aV"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)
p165
aVAnd of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.
p166
aVNow the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you
p167
aVis the ferocity of the bite.
p168
aVWham! It hits me by my right leg.
p169
aVIt pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch.
p170
aVIt's shaking me violently.
p171
aVIt's a very strange sensation
p172
aVhaving another creature try and eat you,
p173
aVand there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVSolly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.
p176
aVHe turns. He begins to make his way to me.
p177
aVThe croc again continues to shake me.
p178
aVIt goes to bite me a second time.
p179
aVI notice a slick of blood in the water around me
p180
aVthat gets washed downstream.
p181
aVAs it bites the second time, I kick.
p182
aVMy foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.
p183
aVI pull myself up into the branches,
p184
aVand as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder.
p185
aVMy leg from the knee down
p186
aVis mangled beyond description.
p187
aVThe bone is cracked.
p188
aVThe meat is torn up.
p189
aVI make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again.
p190
aVAs I come out of the water,
p191
aVSolly arrives at a deep section,
p192
aVa channel between us.
p193
aVHe knows, he sees the state of my leg,
p194
aVhe knows that between him and I
p195
aVthere is a crocodile,
p196
aVand I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second.
p197
aVHe comes straight into the channel.
p198
aVHe wades in to above his waist.
p199
aVHe gets to me. He grabs me.
p200
aVI'm still in a vulnerable position.
p201
aVHe picks me and puts me on his shoulder.
p202
aVThis is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong.
p203
aVHe turns. He walks me up the bank.
p204
aVHe lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.
p205
aVHe wraps it around my leg,
p206
aVpicks me up a second time,
p207
aVwalks me to a vehicle,
p208
aVand he's able to get me to medical attention.
p209
aVAnd I survive.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow \u2014 (Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VNow I don't know how many people you know
p214
aVthat go into a deep channel of water
p215
aVthat they know has a crocodile in it
p216
aVto come and help you,
p217
aVbut for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.
p218
aVAnd he is one amazing example
p219
aVof what I have experienced all over Africa.
p220
aVIn a more collective society,
p221
aVwe realize from the inside
p222
aVthat our own well-being is deeply tied
p223
aVto the well-being of others.
p224
aVDanger is shared. Pain is shared.
p225
aVJoy is shared. Achievement is shared.
p226
aVHouses are shared. Food is shared.
p227
aVUbuntu asks us to open our hearts
p228
aVand to share,
p229
aVand what Solly taught me that day
p230
aVis the essence of this value,
p231
aVhis animated, empathetic action
p232
aVin every moment.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow although the root word is about people,
p235
aVI thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.
p236
aVAnd then I met this young lady.
p237
aVHer name was Elvis.
p238
aVIn fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis
p239
aVbecause he said she walked like she was doing
p240
aVthe Elvis the pelvis dance.
p241
aVShe was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis.
p242
aVShe arrived at our reserve from a reserve
p243
aVeast of us on her migratory route.
p244
aVWhen I first saw her,
p245
aVI thought she would be dead in a matter of days.
p246
aVAnd yet, for the next five years
p247
aVshe returned in the winter months.
p248
aVAnd we would be so excited to be out in the bush
p249
aVand to come across this unusual track.
p250
aVIt looked like an inverted bracket,
p251
aVand we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow,
p252
aVand then we would come around the corner,
p253
aVand there she would be with her herd.
p254
aVAnd that outpouring of emotion
p255
aVfrom people on our safari trucks
p256
aVas they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.
p257
aVAnd it reminded me
p258
aVthat even people who grow up in cities
p259
aVfeel a natural connection
p260
aVwith the natural world and with animals.
p261
aVAnd yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.
p262
aVAnd then one day we came across them at this small water hole.
p263
aVIt was sort of a hollow in the ground.
p264
aVAnd I watched as the matriarch drank,
p265
aVand then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants,
p266
aVlooks like the arm in motion,
p267
aVand she began to make her way up the steep bank.
p268
aVThe rest of the herd turned and began to follow.
p269
aVAnd I watched young Elvis
p270
aVbegin to psych herself up for the hill.
p271
aVShe got visibly \u2014 ears came forward,
p272
aVshe had a full go of it and halfway up,
p273
aVher legs gave way, and she fell backwards.
p274
aVShe attempted it a second time,
p275
aVand again, halfway up, she fell backwards.
p276
aVAnd on the third attempt,
p277
aVan amazing thing happened.
p278
aVHalfway up the bank,
p279
aVa young teenage elephant came in behind her,
p280
aVand he propped his trunk underneath her,
p281
aVand he began to shovel her up the bank.
p282
aVAnd it occurred to me
p283
aVthat the rest of the herd
p284
aVwas in fact looking after this young elephant.
p285
aVThe next day I watched again
p286
aVas the matriarch broke a branch
p287
aVand she would put it in her mouth,
p288
aVand then she would break a second one
p289
aVand drop it on the ground.
p290
aVAnd a consensus developed between all of us
p291
aVwho were guiding people in that area
p292
aVthat that herd was in fact moving slower
p293
aVto accommodate that elephant.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat Elvis and the herd taught me
p296
aVcaused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,
p297
aVand I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,
p298
aVwe get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves
p299
aVreflected back at us.
p300
aVAnd it is not only through other people
p301
aVthat we get to experience our humanity
p302
aVbut through all the creatures that live on this planet.
p303
aVIf Africa has a gift to share,
p304
aVit's a gift of a more collective society.
p305
aVAnd while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,
p306
aVwhat I see is the essence of that value
p307
aVbeing invented here.
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VPat Mitchell: So Boyd,
p314
aVwe know that you knew President Mandela
p315
aVfrom early childhood
p316
aVand that you heard the news as we all did today,
p317
aVand deeply distraught
p318
aVand know the tragic loss that it is to the world.
p319
aVBut I just wondered if you wanted
p320
aVto share any additional thoughts,
p321
aVbecause we know that you heard that news
p322
aVjust before coming in to do this session.
p323
aa(lp324
VBoyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.
p325
aVI'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.
p326
aVHe was suffering.
p327
aVAnd so of course there's the mixed emotions.
p328
aVBut I just think of so many occurrences
p329
aVlike the time he went on the Oprah show
p330
aVand asked her what the show would be about.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVAnd she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."
p333
aVI mean, that's just incredible humility.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VHe was the father of our nation
p337
aVand we've got a road to walk in South Africa.
p338
aVAnd everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.
p339
aVYou know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win.
p340
aVAnywhere he went, things went well.
p341
aVBut I think that magic will be with us,
p342
aVand the important thing is that we carry
p343
aVwhat he stood for.
p344
aVAnd so that's what I'm going to try and do,
p345
aVand that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do.
p346
aa(lp347
VPM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.
p348
aa(lp349
VPM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.
