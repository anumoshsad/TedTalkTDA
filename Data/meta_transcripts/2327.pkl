VBillie Jean King: Hi, everyone!
p4
aa(lp5
V(Applause)
p6
aa(lp7
VThanks, Pat.
p8
aVThank you!
p9
aVGetting me all wound up, now!
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VPat Mitchell: Good!
p14
aVYou know, when I was watching the video again of the match,
p15
aVyou must have felt like the fate of the world's women
p16
aVwas on every stroke you took.
p17
aVWere you feeling that?
p18
aa(lp19
VBJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs \u2014 he was the former number one player,
p20
aVhe wasn't just some hacker, by the way.
p21
aVHe was one of my heroes and I admired him.
p22
aVAnd that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VIt's true \u2014 my mom and especially my dad always said:
p27
aV"Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever."
p28
aVAnd he was correct. He was absolutely correct.
p29
aVBut I knew it was about social change.
p30
aVAnd I was really nervous whenever we announced it,
p31
aVand I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders.
p32
aVAnd I thought, "If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least."
p33
aVTitle IX had just been passed the year before \u2014 June 23, 1972.
p34
aVAnd women's professional tennis \u2014
p35
aVthere were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 \u2014
p36
aVnow remember, the match is in '73.
p37
aVSo we were only in our third year of having a tour
p38
aVwhere we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living.
p39
aVSo there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract.
p40
aVAnd our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world \u2014
p41
aVif she was good enough \u2014
p42
aVthere would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living.
p43
aVBecause before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day,
p44
aVand we were under the control of organizations.
p45
aVSo we really wanted to break away from that.
p46
aVBut we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much;
p47
aVwe knew it was about the future generations.
p48
aa(lp49
VWe do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question.
p50
aVBut every generation has the chance to make it better.
p51
aVThat was really on my mind.
p52
aVI really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX.
p53
aVTitle IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't,
p54
aVsaid that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university,
p55
aVeither public or private,
p56
aVhad to \u2014 finally \u2014 give equal monies to boys and girls.
p57
aVAnd that changed everything.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo you can have a law,
p62
aVbut it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it.
p63
aVThat's when it really rocks, totally.
p64
aVSo that was on my mind.
p65
aVI wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut two things came out of that match.
p68
aVFor women: self-confidence, empowerment.
p69
aVThey actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise.
p70
aVSome women have waited 10, 15 years to ask.
p71
aVI said, "More importantly, did you get it?"
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd they did!
p76
aVAnd for the men?
p77
aVA lot of the men today don't realize it,
p78
aVbut if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s,
p79
aVyou're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement \u2014
p80
aVwhether you like it or not!
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd for the men,
p87
aVwhat happened for the men, they'd come up to me \u2014
p88
aVand most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes,
p89
aVit's very interesting.
p90
aVThey go, "Billie, I was very young when I saw that match,
p91
aVand now I have a daughter.
p92
aVAnd I am so happy I saw that as a young man."
p93
aVAnd one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama.
p94
aVAnd he actually told me that when I met him, he said:
p95
aV"You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12.
p96
aVAnd now I have two daughters,
p97
aVand it has made a difference in how I raise them."
p98
aVSo both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things.
p99
aa(lp100
VPM: And now there are generations \u2014 at least one or two \u2014
p101
aVwho have experienced the equality
p102
aVthat Title IX and other fights along the way made possible.
p103
aVAnd for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork.
p104
aVThey got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before.
p105
aVSo you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete,
p106
aVa legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes
p107
aVand the Women's Sports Foundation.
p108
aVWhat now are you looking to accomplish
p109
aVwith The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?
p110
aa(lp111
VBJK: I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12.
p112
aVAt 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world,
p113
aVand a friend had asked me to play and I said, "What's that?"
p114
aVTennis was not in my family \u2014 basketball was, other sports.
p115
aVFast forward to 12 years old,
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
Vand I'm finally starting to play in tournaments
p120
aVwhere you get a ranking at the end of the year.
p121
aVSo I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,
p122
aVand I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was,
p123
aVbut also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes,
p124
aVplayed with white balls \u2014 everybody who played was white.
p125
aVAnd I said to myself, at 12 years old, "Where is everyone else?"
p126
aVAnd that just kept sticking in my brain.
p127
aVAnd that moment,
p128
aVI promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities
p129
aVfor boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life.
p130
aVAnd that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one \u2014
p131
aVand I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence,
p132
aValready at that age \u2014
p133
aVthat I had this platform.
p134
aVAnd tennis is global.
p135
aVAnd I thought, "You know what?
p136
aVI've been given an opportunity that very few people have had."
p137
aVI didn't know if I was going to make it \u2014 this was only 12.
p138
aVI sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion.
p139
aVI just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word.
p140
aVThat's who I truly am, just fighting for people.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd, unfortunately, women have had less.
p143
aVAnd we are considered less.
p144
aVAnd so my attentions, where did they have to go?
p145
aVIt was just ... you have to.
p146
aVAnd learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice.
p147
aVYou hear the same words keep coming out all the time,
p148
aVand I got really lucky because I had an education.
p149
aVAnd I think if you can see it you can be it, you know?
p150
aVIf you can see it, you can be it.
p151
aVYou look at Pat, you look at other leaders,
p152
aVyou look at these speakers, look at yourself,
p153
aVbecause everyone \u2014
p154
aVeveryone \u2014
p155
aVcan do something extraordinary.
p156
aVEvery single person.
p157
aa(lp158
VPM: And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere.
p159
aVNow with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative,
p160
aVyou're taking on an even bigger cause.
p161
aVBecause one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice,
p162
aVworking to find their way into leadership positions.
p163
aVBut what you're talking about is even bigger than that.
p164
aVIt's inclusive leadership.
p165
aVAnd this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively \u2014
p166
aa(lp167
VBJK: Isn't it great? Look at the technology!
p168
aVIt's amazing how it connects us all! It's about connection.
p169
aVIt's simply amazing what's possible because of it.
p170
aVBut the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative
p171
aVis really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it,
p172
aVso people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves.
p173
aa(lp174
VBecause most of us have two jobs:
p175
aVOne, to fit in \u2014 I'll give you a perfect example.
p176
aVAn African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work,
p177
aVstraightens her hair in the bathroom,
p178
aVgoes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day
p179
aVto keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in.
p180
aVSo she's working two jobs.
p181
aVShe's got this other job, whatever that may be,
p182
aVbut she's also trying to fit in.
p183
aVOr this poor man who kept his diploma \u2014
p184
aVhe went to University of Michigan,
p185
aVbut he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever \u2014
p186
aVjust would not mention it.
p187
aVSo he made sure they saw he was well-educated.
p188
aVAnd then you see a gay guy who has an NFL \u2014
p189
aVwhich means American football for all of you out there,
p190
aVit's a big deal, it's very macho \u2014
p191
aVand he talked about football all the time,
p192
aVbecause he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know.
p193
aVIt just goes on and on.
p194
aVSo my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7,
p195
aVthat would be the ultimate.
p196
aVAnd we catch ourselves \u2014 I mean, I catch myself to this day.
p197
aVEven being gay I catch myself, you know, like,
p198
aa(lp199
V(Gasp)
p200
aa(lp201
Va little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut,
p202
aVfeeling not totally comfortable in my own skin.
p203
aVSo, I think you have to ask yourself \u2014
p204
aVI want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be.
p205
aa(lp206
VPM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that,
p207
aVthat these examples you just used \u2014
p208
aVthat many of us have the problem of being authentic.
p209
aVBut what you've just looked at is this millennial generation,
p210
aVwho have benefited from all these equal opportunities \u2014
p211
aVwhich may not be equal but exist everywhere \u2014
p212
aa(lp213
VBJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.
p214
aVPartnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing.
p215
aVThat's really the reason I'm able to do this.
p216
aVI've had two times in my life
p217
aVwhere I've actually had men really behind me with power.
p218
aVAnd that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,
p219
aVand this is the second time in my entire life.
p220
aVAnd then Deloitte.
p221
aVThe one thing I wanted was data \u2014 facts.
p222
aVSo Deloitte sent out a survey,
p223
aVand over 4,000 people now have answered,
p224
aVand we're continuing in the workplace.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd what do the millennials feel?
p227
aVWell, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is \u2014
p228
aVyou know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation."
p229
aVSo if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented.
p230
aVThat's not good enough anymore, which is so good!
p231
aVSo the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement.
p232
aVThey just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking,
p233
aVand get into the solution.
p234
aVThey're problem-solvers,
p235
aVand of course, you've got the information at your fingertips,
p236
aVcompared to when I was growing up.
p237
aa(lp238
VPM: What did the research show you about millennials?
p239
aVAre they going to make a difference?
p240
aVAre they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?
p241
aa(lp242
VBJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce
p243
aVis going to be millennials.
p244
aVI think they are going to help solve problems.
p245
aVI think they have the wherewithal to do it.
p246
aVI know they care a lot.
p247
aVThey have big ideas and they can make big things happen.
p248
aVI want to stay in the now with the young people,
p249
aVI don't want to get behind.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VPM: I don't think there's any chance!
p254
aVBut what you found out in the research about millennials
p255
aVis not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials.
p256
aa(lp257
VBJK: No, well, if we want to talk \u2014 OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.
p258
aVI've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go,
p259
aV"What do you think about the millennials?"
p260
aVAnd I'm pretty excited, like it's good,
p261
aVand they get this face \u2014
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
V"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VI say, "Do you really think so?
p270
aVBecause I do think they care about the environment
p271
aVand all these things."
p272
aVAnd they go, "Oh, Billie, they cannot focus."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VThey actually have proven
p277
aa(lp278
Vthat the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VThey can't focus.
p283
aVAnd they don't really care.
p284
aVI just heard a story the other night:
p285
aVa woman owns a gallery and she has these workers.
p286
aVShe gets a text from one of the workers,
p287
aVlike an intern, she's just starting \u2014 she goes,
p288
aV"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's."
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VSo she arrives, and this boss says,
p293
aV"What's going on?"
p294
aVAnd she says, "Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?"
p295
aVShe says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished."
p296
aVShe goes, "OK."
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VNo problem!
p301
aVPM: Now Billie, that story \u2014
p302
aVI know, but that's what scares the boomers \u2014
p303
aVI'm just telling you \u2014 so I think it's good for us to share.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VNo, it is good for us to share,
p308
aVbecause we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling,
p309
aVso we've got to take it both ways, you know?
p310
aVBut I have great faith because \u2014
p311
aVif you've been in sports like I have \u2014
p312
aVevery generation gets better.
p313
aVIt's a fact.
p314
aVWith the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still,
p315
aVbecause we're trying to keep protecting the law,
p316
aVbecause it's in a tenuous position always,
p317
aVso we really are concerned,
p318
aVand we do a lot of research.
p319
aVThat's very important to us.
p320
aVAnd I want to hear from people.
p321
aVBut we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide.
p322
aVAnd you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected.
p323
aVAnd do you know that every single lawsuit
p324
aVthat girls, at least in sports, have gone up against \u2014
p325
aVwhatever institutions \u2014
p326
aVhas won?
p327
aVTitle IX is there to protect us.
p328
aVAnd it is amazing.
p329
aVBut we still have to get the hearts and minds \u2014
p330
aVthe hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge.
p331
aa(lp332
VPM: So what gets you up every morning?
p333
aVWhat keeps you sustaining your work,
p334
aVsustaining the fight for equality, extending it,
p335
aValways exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... ?
p336
aa(lp337
VBJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one.
p338
aVI'm highly motivated.
p339
aVMy younger brother was a Major League Baseball player.
p340
aVMy poor parents did not care if we were any good.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd we drove them crazy because we pushed,
p345
aVwe pushed because we wanted to be the best.
p346
aVAnd I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks.
p347
aVI think to listen to these different women,
p348
aVto listen to different people,
p349
aVto listen to President Carter \u2014 90 years old, by the way,
p350
aVand he we was throwing these figures out that I would never \u2014
p351
aVI'd have to go,
p352
aV"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures."
p353
aVHe was rattling off \u2014 I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.
p354
aa(lp355
VPM: He's an amazing man.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VBJK: And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson,
p360
aVwho's a former president \u2014
p361
aVThank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VCongress is voting in June on same-sex marriage,
p366
aVso these are things that for some people are very hard to hear.
p367
aVBut always remember, every one of us is an individual,
p368
aVa human being with a beating heart,
p369
aVwho cares and wants to live their authentic life.
p370
aVOK? You don't have to agree with somebody,
p371
aVbut everyone has the opportunity.
p372
aa(lp373
VI think we all have an obligation
p374
aVto continue to keep moving the needle forward, always.
p375
aVAnd these people have been so inspiring.
p376
aVEveryone matters.
p377
aVAnd every one of you is an influencer.
p378
aVYou out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here \u2014
p379
aVevery single person's an influencer.
p380
aVNever, ever forget that. OK?
p381
aVSo don't ever give up on yourself.
p382
aa(lp383
VPM: Billie, you have been an inspiration for us.
p384
aa(lp385
