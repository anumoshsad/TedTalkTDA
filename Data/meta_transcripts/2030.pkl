VI am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon,
p4
aVand my research focuses on usable privacy and security,
p5
aVand so my friends like to give me examples
p6
aVof their frustrations with computing systems,
p7
aVespecially frustrations related to
p8
aVunusable privacy and security.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo passwords are something that I hear a lot about.
p11
aVA lot of people are frustrated with passwords,
p12
aVand it's bad enough
p13
aVwhen you have to have one really good password
p14
aVthat you can remember
p15
aVbut nobody else is going to be able to guess.
p16
aVBut what do you do when you have accounts
p17
aVon a hundred different systems
p18
aVand you're supposed to have a unique password
p19
aVfor each of these systems?
p20
aVIt's tough.
p21
aa(lp22
VAt Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it
p23
aVactually pretty easy for us
p24
aVto remember our passwords.
p25
aVThe password requirement up through 2009
p26
aVwas just that you had to have a password
p27
aVwith at least one character.
p28
aVPretty easy. But then they changed things,
p29
aVand at the end of 2009, they announced
p30
aVthat we were going to have a new policy,
p31
aVand this new policy required
p32
aVpasswords that were at least eight characters long,
p33
aVwith an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,
p34
aVa digit, a symbol,
p35
aVyou couldn't use the same character more than three times,
p36
aVand it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, when they implemented this new policy,
p39
aVa lot of people, my colleagues and friends,
p40
aVcame up to me and they said, "Wow,
p41
aVnow that's really unusable.
p42
aVWhy are they doing this to us,
p43
aVand why didn't you stop them?"
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd I said, "Well, you know what?
p46
aVThey didn't ask me."
p47
aa(lp48
VBut I got curious, and I decided to go talk
p49
aVto the people in charge of our computer systems
p50
aVand find out what led them to introduce
p51
aVthis new policy,
p52
aVand they said that the university
p53
aVhad joined a consortium of universities,
p54
aVand one of the requirements of membership
p55
aVwas that we had to have stronger passwords
p56
aVthat complied with some new requirements,
p57
aVand these requirements were that our passwords
p58
aVhad to have a lot of entropy.
p59
aVNow entropy is a complicated term,
p60
aVbut basically it measures the strength of passwords.
p61
aVBut the thing is, there isn't actually
p62
aVa standard measure of entropy.
p63
aVNow, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
p64
aVhas a set of guidelines
p65
aVwhich have some rules of thumb
p66
aVfor measuring entropy,
p67
aVbut they don't have anything too specific,
p68
aVand the reason they only have rules of thumb
p69
aVis it turns out they don't actually have any good data
p70
aVon passwords.
p71
aVIn fact, their report states,
p72
aV"Unfortunately, we do not have much data
p73
aVon the passwords users choose under particular rules.
p74
aVNIST would like to obtain more data
p75
aVon the passwords users actually choose,
p76
aVbut system administrators are understandably reluctant
p77
aVto reveal password data to others."
p78
aa(lp79
VSo this is a problem, but our research group
p80
aVlooked at it as an opportunity.
p81
aVWe said, "Well, there's a need for good password data.
p82
aVMaybe we can collect some good password data
p83
aVand actually advance the state of the art here.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo the first thing we did is,
p86
aVwe got a bag of candy bars
p87
aVand we walked around campus
p88
aVand talked to students, faculty and staff,
p89
aVand asked them for information
p90
aVabout their passwords.
p91
aVNow we didn't say, "Give us your password."
p92
aVNo, we just asked them about their password.
p93
aVHow long is it? Does it have a digit?
p94
aVDoes it have a symbol?
p95
aVAnd were you annoyed at having to create
p96
aVa new one last week?
p97
aVSo we got results from 470 students,
p98
aVfaculty and staff,
p99
aVand indeed we confirmed that the new policy
p100
aVwas very annoying,
p101
aVbut we also found that people said
p102
aVthey felt more secure with these new passwords.
p103
aVWe found that most people knew
p104
aVthey were not supposed to write their password down,
p105
aVand only 13 percent of them did,
p106
aVbut disturbingly, 80 percent of people
p107
aVsaid they were reusing their password.
p108
aVNow, this is actually more dangerous
p109
aVthan writing your password down,
p110
aVbecause it makes you much more susceptible to attackers.
p111
aVSo if you have to, write your passwords down,
p112
aVbut don't reuse them.
p113
aVWe also found some interesting things
p114
aVabout the symbols people use in passwords.
p115
aVSo CMU allows 32 possible symbols,
p116
aVbut as you can see, there's only a small number
p117
aVthat most people are using,
p118
aVso we're not actually getting very much strength
p119
aVfrom the symbols in our passwords.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo this was a really interesting study,
p122
aVand now we had data from 470 people,
p123
aVbut in the scheme of things,
p124
aVthat's really not very much password data,
p125
aVand so we looked around to see
p126
aVwhere could we find additional password data?
p127
aVSo it turns out there are a lot of people
p128
aVgoing around stealing passwords,
p129
aVand they often go and post these passwords
p130
aVon the Internet.
p131
aVSo we were able to get access
p132
aVto some of these stolen password sets.
p133
aVThis is still not really ideal for research, though,
p134
aVbecause it's not entirely clear
p135
aVwhere all of these passwords came from,
p136
aVor exactly what policies were in effect
p137
aVwhen people created these passwords.
p138
aVSo we wanted to find some better source of data.
p139
aVSo we decided that one thing we could do
p140
aVis we could do a study and have people
p141
aVactually create passwords for our study.
p142
aVSo we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk,
p143
aVand this is a service where you can post
p144
aVa small job online that takes a minute,
p145
aVa few minutes, an hour,
p146
aVand pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,
p147
aVto do a task for you,
p148
aVand then you pay them through Amazon.com.
p149
aVSo we paid people about 50 cents
p150
aVto create a password following our rules
p151
aVand answering a survey,
p152
aVand then we paid them again to come back
p153
aVtwo days later and log in
p154
aVusing their password and answering another survey.
p155
aVSo we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,
p156
aVand we gave people a bunch of different policies
p157
aVto create passwords with.
p158
aVSo some people had a pretty easy policy,
p159
aVwe call it Basic8,
p160
aVand here the only rule was that your password
p161
aVhad to have at least eight characters.
p162
aVThen some people had a much harder policy,
p163
aVand this was very similar to the CMU policy,
p164
aVthat it had to have eight characters
p165
aVincluding uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,
p166
aVand pass a dictionary check.
p167
aVAnd one of the other policies we tried,
p168
aVand there were a whole bunch more,
p169
aVbut one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,
p170
aVand the only requirement here
p171
aVwas that your password had to have at least 16 characters.
p172
aa(lp173
VAll right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,
p174
aVand so we had much more detailed information.
p175
aVAgain we see that there's only a small number
p176
aVof symbols that people are actually using
p177
aVin their passwords.
p178
aVWe also wanted to get an idea of how strong
p179
aVthe passwords were that people were creating,
p180
aVbut as you may recall, there isn't a good measure
p181
aVof password strength.
p182
aVSo what we decided to do was to see
p183
aVhow long it would take to crack these passwords
p184
aVusing the best cracking tools
p185
aVthat the bad guys are using,
p186
aVor that we could find information about
p187
aVin the research literature.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo to give you an idea of how bad guys
p190
aVgo about cracking passwords,
p191
aVthey will steal a password file
p192
aVthat will have all of the passwords
p193
aVin kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,
p194
aVand so what they'll do is they'll make a guess
p195
aVas to what a password is,
p196
aVrun it through a hashing function,
p197
aVand see whether it matches
p198
aVthe passwords they have on their stolen password list.
p199
aVSo a dumb attacker will try every password in order.
p200
aVThey'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,
p201
aVand this is going to take a really long time
p202
aVbefore they get any passwords
p203
aVthat people are really likely to actually have.
p204
aVA smart attacker, on the other hand,
p205
aVdoes something much more clever.
p206
aVThey look at the passwords
p207
aVthat are known to be popular
p208
aVfrom these stolen password sets,
p209
aVand they guess those first.
p210
aVSo they're going to start by guessing "password,"
p211
aVand then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"
p212
aVand "12345678,"
p213
aVbecause these are the passwords
p214
aVthat are most likely for people to have.
p215
aVIn fact, some of you probably have these passwords.
p216
aVSo what we found
p217
aVby running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected
p218
aVthrough these tests to see how strong they were,
p219
aVwe found that the long passwords
p220
aVwere actually pretty strong,
p221
aVand the complex passwords were pretty strong too.
p222
aVHowever, when we looked at the survey data,
p223
aVwe saw that people were really frustrated
p224
aVby the very complex passwords,
p225
aVand the long passwords were a lot more usable,
p226
aVand in some cases, they were actually
p227
aVeven stronger than the complex passwords.
p228
aVSo this suggests that,
p229
aVinstead of telling people that they need
p230
aVto put all these symbols and numbers
p231
aVand crazy things into their passwords,
p232
aVwe might be better off just telling people
p233
aVto have long passwords.
p234
aVNow here's the problem, though:
p235
aVSome people had long passwords
p236
aVthat actually weren't very strong.
p237
aVYou can make long passwords
p238
aVthat are still the sort of thing
p239
aVthat an attacker could easily guess.
p240
aVSo we need to do more than just say long passwords.
p241
aVThere has to be some additional requirements,
p242
aVand some of our ongoing research is looking at
p243
aVwhat additional requirements we should add
p244
aVto make for stronger passwords
p245
aVthat also are going to be easy for people
p246
aVto remember and type.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnother approach to getting people to have
p249
aVstronger passwords is to use a password meter.
p250
aVHere are some examples.
p251
aVYou may have seen these on the Internet
p252
aVwhen you were creating passwords.
p253
aVWe decided to do a study to find out
p254
aVwhether these password meters actually work.
p255
aVDo they actually help people
p256
aVhave stronger passwords,
p257
aVand if so, which ones are better?
p258
aVSo we tested password meters that were
p259
aVdifferent sizes, shapes, colors,
p260
aVdifferent words next to them,
p261
aVand we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.
p262
aVAs you type a better password,
p263
aVthe bunny dances faster and faster.
p264
aVSo this was pretty fun.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhat we found
p267
aVwas that password meters do work.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aVMost of the password meters were actually effective,
p270
aVand the dancing bunny was very effective too,
p271
aVbut the password meters that were the most effective
p272
aVwere the ones that made you work harder
p273
aVbefore they gave you that thumbs up and said
p274
aVyou were doing a good job,
p275
aVand in fact we found that most
p276
aVof the password meters on the Internet today
p277
aVare too soft.
p278
aVThey tell you you're doing a good job too early,
p279
aVand if they would just wait a little bit
p280
aVbefore giving you that positive feedback,
p281
aVyou probably would have better passwords.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow another approach to better passwords, perhaps,
p284
aVis to use pass phrases instead of passwords.
p285
aVSo this was an xkcd cartoon  from a couple of years ago,
p286
aVand the cartoonist suggests
p287
aVthat we should all use pass phrases,
p288
aVand if you look at the second row of this cartoon,
p289
aVyou can see the cartoonist is suggesting
p290
aVthat the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple"
p291
aVwould be a very strong pass phrase
p292
aVand something really easy to remember.
p293
aVHe says, in fact, you've already remembered it.
p294
aVAnd so we decided to do a research study
p295
aVto find out whether this was true or not.
p296
aVIn fact, everybody who I talk to,
p297
aVwho I mention I'm doing password research,
p298
aVthey point out this cartoon.
p299
aV"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.
p300
aVCorrect horse battery staple."
p301
aVSo we did the research study to see
p302
aVwhat would actually happen.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,
p305
aVand we had the computer pick the random words
p306
aVin the pass phrase.
p307
aVNow the reason we did this
p308
aVis that humans are not very good
p309
aVat picking random words.
p310
aVIf we asked a human to do it,
p311
aVthey would pick things that were not very random.
p312
aVSo we tried a few different conditions.
p313
aVIn one condition, the computer picked
p314
aVfrom a dictionary of the very common words
p315
aVin the English language,
p316
aVand so you'd get pass phrases like
p317
aV"try there three come."
p318
aVAnd we looked at that, and we said,
p319
aV"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."
p320
aVSo then we tried picking words
p321
aVthat came from specific parts of speech,
p322
aVso how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.
p323
aVThat comes up with something that's sort of sentence-like.
p324
aVSo you can get a pass phrase like
p325
aV"plan builds sure power"
p326
aVor "end determines red drug."
p327
aVAnd these seemed a little bit more memorable,
p328
aVand maybe people would like those a little bit better.
p329
aVWe wanted to compare them with passwords,
p330
aVand so we had the computer pick random passwords,
p331
aVand these were nice and short, but as you can see,
p332
aVthey don't really look very memorable.
p333
aVAnd then we decided to try something called
p334
aVa pronounceable password.
p335
aVSo here the computer picks random syllables
p336
aVand puts them together
p337
aVso you have something sort of pronounceable,
p338
aVlike "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."
p339
aVThat one kind of rolls off your tongue.
p340
aVSo these were random passwords that were
p341
aVgenerated by our computer.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,
p344
aVpass phrases were not actually all that good.
p345
aVPeople were not really better at remembering
p346
aVthe pass phrases than these random passwords,
p347
aVand because the pass phrases are longer,
p348
aVthey took longer to type
p349
aVand people made more errors while typing them in.
p350
aVSo it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.
p351
aVSorry, all of you xkcd fans.
p352
aVOn the other hand, we did find
p353
aVthat pronounceable passwords
p354
aVworked surprisingly well,
p355
aVand so we actually are doing some more research
p356
aVto see if we can make that approach work even better.
p357
aVSo one of the problems
p358
aVwith some of the studies that we've done
p359
aVis that because they're all done
p360
aVusing Mechanical Turk,
p361
aVthese are not people's real passwords.
p362
aVThey're the passwords that they created
p363
aVor the computer created for them for our study.
p364
aVAnd we wanted to know whether people
p365
aVwould actually behave the same way
p366
aVwith their real passwords.
p367
aa(lp368
VSo we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon
p369
aVand asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords.
p370
aVNot surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant
p371
aVto share them with us,
p372
aVbut we were actually able to work out
p373
aVa system with them
p374
aVwhere they put all of the real passwords
p375
aVfor 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,
p376
aVinto a locked computer in a locked room,
p377
aVnot connected to the Internet,
p378
aVand they ran code on it that we wrote
p379
aVto analyze these passwords.
p380
aVThey audited our code.
p381
aVThey ran the code.
p382
aVAnd so we never actually saw
p383
aVanybody's password.
p384
aa(lp385
VWe got some interesting results,
p386
aVand those of you Tepper students in the back
p387
aVwill be very interested in this.
p388
aVSo we found that the passwords created
p389
aVby people affiliated with the school of computer science
p390
aVwere actually 1.8 times stronger
p391
aVthan those affiliated with the business school.
p392
aVWe have lots of other really interesting
p393
aVdemographic information as well.
p394
aVThe other interesting thing that we found
p395
aVis that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords
p396
aVto the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,
p397
aVthere was actually a lot of similarities,
p398
aVand so this helped validate our research method
p399
aVand show that actually, collecting passwords
p400
aVusing these Mechanical Turk studies
p401
aVis actually a valid way to study passwords.
p402
aVSo that was good news.
p403
aa(lp404
VOkay, I want to close by talking about
p405
aVsome insights I gained while on sabbatical
p406
aVlast year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.
p407
aVOne of the things that I did
p408
aVis I made a number of quilts,
p409
aVand I made this quilt here.
p410
aVIt's called "Security Blanket."
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aVAnd this quilt has the 1,000
p413
aVmost frequent passwords stolen
p414
aVfrom the RockYou website.
p415
aVAnd the size of the passwords is proportional
p416
aVto how frequently they appeared
p417
aVin the stolen dataset.
p418
aVAnd what I did is I created this word cloud,
p419
aVand I went through all 1,000 words,
p420
aVand I categorized them into
p421
aVloose thematic categories.
p422
aVAnd it was, in some cases,
p423
aVit was kind of difficult to figure out
p424
aVwhat category they should be in,
p425
aVand then I color-coded them.
p426
aa(lp427
VSo here are some examples of the difficulty.
p428
aVSo "justin."
p429
aVIs that the name of the user,
p430
aVtheir boyfriend, their son?
p431
aVMaybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.
p432
aVOr "princess."
p433
aVIs that a nickname?
p434
aVAre they Disney princess fans?
p435
aVOr maybe that's the name of their cat.
p436
aV"Iloveyou" appears many times
p437
aVin many different languages.
p438
aVThere's a lot of love in these passwords.
p439
aVIf you look carefully, you'll see there's also
p440
aVsome profanity,
p441
aVbut it was really interesting to me to see
p442
aVthat there's a lot more love than hate
p443
aVin these passwords.
p444
aVAnd there are animals,
p445
aVa lot of animals,
p446
aVand "monkey" is the most common animal
p447
aVand the 14th most popular password overall.
p448
aVAnd this was really curious to me,
p449
aVand I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?"
p450
aVAnd so in our last password study,
p451
aVany time we detected somebody
p452
aVcreating a password with the word "monkey" in it,
p453
aVwe asked them why they had a monkey in their password.
p454
aVAnd what we found out \u2014
p455
aVwe found 17 people so far, I think,
p456
aVwho have the word "monkey" \u2014
p457
aVWe found out about a third of them said
p458
aVthey have a pet named "monkey"
p459
aVor a friend whose nickname is "monkey,"
p460
aVand about a third of them said
p461
aVthat they just like monkeys
p462
aVand monkeys are really cute.
p463
aVAnd that guy is really cute.
p464
aa(lp465
VSo it seems that at the end of the day,
p466
aVwhen we make passwords,
p467
aVwe either make something that's really easy
p468
aVto type, a common pattern,
p469
aVor things that remind us of the word password
p470
aVor the account that we've created the password for,
p471
aVor whatever.
p472
aVOr we think about things that make us happy,
p473
aVand we create our password
p474
aVbased on things that make us happy.
p475
aVAnd while this makes typing
p476
aVand remembering your password more fun,
p477
aVit also makes it a lot easier
p478
aVto guess your password.
p479
aVSo I know a lot of these TED Talks
p480
