VSo, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
p4
aVThey ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.
p5
aVAnd I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
p6
aVI will say that life involves computation.
p7
aVSo this is a computer program.
p8
aVBooted up in a cell, the program would execute,
p9
aVand it could result in this person;
p10
aVor with a small change, it could result in this person;
p11
aVor another small change, this person;
p12
aVor with a larger change, this dog,
p13
aVor this tree, or this whale.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo now, if you take this metaphor
p16
aV[of] genome as program seriously,
p17
aVyou have to consider that Chris Anderson
p18
aVis a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,
p19
aVCraig Venter, as are all of us.
p20
aVAnd in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,
p21
aVthere are lots of similarities between genetic programs
p22
aVand computer programs that could help to convince you.
p23
aVBut one, to me, that's most compelling
p24
aVis the peculiar sensitivity to small changes
p25
aVthat can make large changes in biological development \u2014 the output.
p26
aVA small mutation can take a two-wing fly
p27
aVand make it a four-wing fly.
p28
aVOr it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
p29
aVOr if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride,"
p30
aVit could create a six-fingered man.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, a hallmark of computer programs
p33
aVis just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
p34
aVIf your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,
p35
aVyou could end up with a thousand dollars.
p36
aVSo these small changes are things that I think
p37
aVthat \u2014 they indicate to us that a complicated computation
p38
aVin development is underlying these amplified, large changes.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,
p41
aVand it shows the power of molecular programs \u2014 biology does.
p42
aVAnd what I want to do is write molecular programs,
p43
aVpotentially to build technology.
p44
aVAnd there are a lot of people doing this,
p45
aVa lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.
p46
aVAnd they concentrate on using cells.
p47
aVThey're cell-oriented.
p48
aVSo my friends, molecular programmers, and I
p49
aVhave a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
p50
aVWe're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,
p51
aVand building new languages for building things from the bottom up,
p52
aVusing biomolecules,
p53
aVpotentially having nothing to do with biology.
p54
aVSo, these are all the machines in a cell.
p55
aVThere's a camera.
p56
aVThere's the solar panels of the cell,
p57
aVsome switches that turn your genes on and off,
p58
aVthe girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
p59
aVMy little group of molecular programmers
p60
aVare trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.
p61
aVWe're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,
p62
aVeasiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.
p63
aVAnd as other things become easier to use \u2014
p64
aVmaybe protein \u2014 we'll work with those.
p65
aa(lp66
VIf we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?
p67
aVYou're going to sit in front of your computer.
p68
aVYou're going to design something like a cell phone,
p69
aVand in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
p70
aVThen you're going to have a compiler
p71
aVthat's going to take that description
p72
aVand it's going to turn it into actual molecules
p73
aVthat can be sent to a synthesizer
p74
aVand that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
p75
aVAnd what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,
p76
aVis it will do a developmental computation,
p77
aVa molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
p78
aVAnd if I haven't revealed my prejudices already,
p79
aVI think that life has been about molecular computers
p80
aVbuilding electrochemical computers,
p81
aVbuilding electronic computers,
p82
aVwhich together with electrochemical computers
p83
aVwill build new molecular computers,
p84
aVwhich will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd if you buy all of this,
p87
aVand you think life is about computation, as I do,
p88
aVthen you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
p89
aVSo one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?
p90
aVAnd for molecular programming,
p91
aVthe question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVOr how does a computer program know when to stop running?
p94
aVOr more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?
p95
aVThere are other questions like this, too.
p96
aVOne of them is Craig Venter's question.
p97
aVTurns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.
p98
aVHe asked, how big is the minimal genome
p99
aVthat will give me a functioning microorganism?
p100
aVHow few genes can I use?
p101
aVThis is exactly analogous to the question,
p102
aVwhat's the smallest program I can write
p103
aVthat will act exactly like Microsoft Word?
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAnd just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,
p106
aVhe's writing genomes that will work,
p107
aVwe could write smaller programs
p108
aVthat would do what Microsoft Word does.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut for molecular programming, our question is,
p111
aVhow many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?
p112
aVWhat's the smallest number we can get away with?
p113
aVNow, these are big questions in computer science.
p114
aVThese are all complexity questions,
p115
aVand computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.
p116
aVAlmost \u2014 many of them are impossible.
p117
aVBut for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
p118
aVSo, I'm going to start asking those questions
p119
aVfor the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.
p120
aVSo, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.
p121
aVIt's double-stranded, it's a double helix,
p122
aVhas the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.
p123
aVAnd I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,
p124
aVjust so I don't scare you.
p125
aVWe want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.
p126
aVWhen we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,
p127
aVso we can take the blue strand in one tube
p128
aVand make an orange strand in the other tube,
p129
aVand they're floppy when they're single-stranded.
p130
aVYou mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
p131
aVNow for the last 25 years,
p132
aVNed Seeman and a bunch of his descendants
p133
aVhave worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures
p134
aVusing this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.
p135
aVBut a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
p136
aVThey can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I came up with a new method a couple of years ago
p139
aVI call DNA origami
p140
aVthat's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen
p141
aVand design the stuff on a laptop.
p142
aVBut to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,
p143
aVwhich is technically very difficult to get.
p144
aVSo, you can go to a natural source.
p145
aVYou can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,
p146
aVand he's got a double-stranded genome \u2014 that's no good.
p147
aVYou look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.
p148
aVThey're no good either.
p149
aVDouble strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus
p150
aVthat has a nice, long, single-stranded genome
p151
aVthat we can fold like a piece of paper.
p152
aVAnd here's how we do it.
p153
aa(lp154
VThis is part of that genome.
p155
aVWe add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
p156
aVEach one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,
p157
aVand a right half that binds it in a different place,
p158
aVand brings the long strand together like this.
p159
aVThe net action of many of these on that long strand
p160
aVis to fold it into something like a rectangle.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, we can't actually take a movie of this process,
p163
aVbut Shawn Douglas at Harvard
p164
aVhas made a nice visualization for us
p165
aVthat begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.
p166
aVAnd what happens is that we mix these strands together.
p167
aVWe heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,
p168
aVwe heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,
p169
aVand as we cool them down,
p170
aVthe short strands bind the long strands
p171
aVand start to form structure.
p172
aVAnd you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.
p173
aVWhen you look at DNA origami,
p174
aVyou can see that what it really is,
p175
aVeven though you think it's complicated,
p176
aVis a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,
p177
aVand they're held together
p178
aVby places where short strands go along one helix
p179
aVand then jump to another one.
p180
aVSo there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds \u2014
p181
aVit jumps to another helix and comes back.
p182
aVThat holds the long strand like this.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, to show that we could make any shape or pattern
p185
aVthat we wanted, I tried to make this shape.
p186
aVI wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,
p187
aVdown the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,
p188
aVback down and end in a little loop like this.
p189
aVAnd so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.
p190
aVSo I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
p191
aVI ordered them; they came by FedEx.
p192
aVI mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,
p193
aVand I got 50 billion little smiley faces
p194
aVfloating around in a single drop of water.
p195
aVAnd each one of these is just
p196
aVone-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,
p199
aVyou have to get them on a surface where they stick.
p200
aVSo, you pour them out onto a surface
p201
aVand they start to stick to that surface,
p202
aVand we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.
p203
aVIt's got a needle, like a record needle,
p204
aVthat goes back and forth over the surface,
p205
aVbumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
p206
aVIt feels the DNA origami.
p207
aVThere's the atomic-force microscope working
p208
aVand you can see that the landing's a little rough.
p209
aVWhen you zoom in, they've got, you know,
p210
aVweak jaws that flip over their heads
p211
aVand some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.
p212
aVYou can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,
p213
aVthis little nano-goatee.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, what's great about this is anybody can do this.
p216
aVAnd so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
p217
aVAnyone know what this is? What is it?
p218
aVIt's China, right?
p219
aVSo, what happened is, a graduate student in China,
p220
aVLulu Qian, did a great job.
p221
aVShe wrote all her own software
p222
aVto design and built this DNA origami,
p223
aVa beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,
p224
aVand you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVSo, this works really well
p227
aVand you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?
p228
aVAnd you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd what's really neat about it \u2014
p231
aVwell, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,
p232
aVbut it turns out that nano-artwork
p233
aVis just what you need to make nano-circuits.
p234
aVSo, you can put circuit components on the staples,
p235
aVlike a light bulb and a light switch.
p236
aVLet the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.
p237
aVAnd then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.
p238
aVSo, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.
p239
aVThey took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,
p240
aVmade a little switch, you see here, wired it up,
p241
aVtested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
p242
aVNow, this is just a single switch
p243
aVand you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.
p244
aVBut this is very promising
p245
aVbecause the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size
p246
aVof those in a normal computer.
p247
aVSo it's very promising for making small computers.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow, I want to get back to that compiler.
p250
aVThe DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.
p251
aVSo, you start with something in the computer.
p252
aVYou get a high-level description of the computer program,
p253
aVa high-level description of the origami.
p254
aVYou can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,
p255
aVand it actually works.
p256
aVAnd it turns out that a company has made a nice program
p257
aVthat's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,
p258
aVand will allow us to do this in a nice,
p259
aVvisual, computer-aided design way.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo, now you can say, all right,
p262
aVwhy isn't DNA origami the end of the story?
p263
aVYou have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.
p264
aVThe fact is that it does not scale.
p265
aVSo if you want to build a human from DNA origami,
p266
aVthe problem is, you need a long strand
p267
aVthat's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
p268
aVThat's three light years' worth of DNA,
p269
aVso we're not going to do this.
p270
aVWe're going to turn to another technology,
p271
aVcalled algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
p272
aVIt was started by Erik Winfree,
p273
aVand what it does,
p274
aVit has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
p275
aVYou zoom in, there are just four DNA strands
p276
aVand they have little single-stranded bits on them
p277
aVthat can bind to other tiles, if they match.
p278
aVAnd we like to draw these tiles as little squares.
p279
aVAnd if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,
p280
aVyou can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.
p281
aVSo, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.
p282
aVAnd the point of this, if you didn't catch that,
p283
aVis that tiles are a kind of molecular program
p284
aVand they can output patterns.
p285
aVAnd a really amazing part of this is
p286
aVthat any computer program can be translated
p287
aVinto one of these tile programs \u2014 specifically, counting.
p288
aVSo, you can come up with a set of tiles
p289
aVthat when they come together, form a little binary counter
p290
aVrather than a checkerboard.
p291
aVSo you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd in order to get these kinds of computations started right,
p294
aVyou need some kind of input, a kind of seed.
p295
aVYou can use DNA origami for that.
p296
aVYou can encode the number 32
p297
aVin the right-hand side of a DNA origami,
p298
aVand when you add those tiles that count,
p299
aVthey will start to count \u2014 they will read that 32
p300
aVand they'll stop at 32.
p301
aVSo, what we've done is we've figured out a way
p302
aVto have a molecular program know when to stop going.
p303
aVIt knows when to stop growing because it can count.
p304
aVIt knows how big it is.
p305
aVSo, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.
p306
aVIt doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things
p309
aVthan DNA origami could otherwise.
p310
aVHere's the DNA origami, and what we can do
p311
aVis we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,
p312
aVand we can now use our watering can
p313
aVand water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that
p314
aVand create a square.
p315
aVThe counter serves as a template
p316
aVto fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
p317
aVSo, what we've done is we've succeeded
p318
aVin making something much bigger than a DNA origami
p319
aVby combining DNA origami with tiles.
p320
aVAnd the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.
p321
aVYou can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation
p322
aVand you'll get 96 rather than 32.
p323
aVAnd if you do that, the origami's the same size,
p324
aVbut the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo, this sort of recapitulates
p327
aVwhat I was telling you about development.
p328
aVYou have a very sensitive computer program
p329
aVwhere small changes \u2014 single, tiny, little mutations \u2014
p330
aVcan take something that made one size square
p331
aVand make something very much bigger.
p332
aVNow, this \u2014 using counting to compute
p333
aVand build these kinds of things
p334
aVby this kind of developmental process
p335
aVis something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
p336
aVSo, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required
p337
aVto build a square of a given size?
p338
aVIf we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,
p339
aVif we used DNA origami alone,
p340
aVwe would require a number of DNA strands that's the square
p341
aVof the size of that square;
p342
aVso we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.
p343
aVThat's really not affordable.
p344
aVBut if we use a little computation \u2014
p345
aVwe use origami, plus some tiles that count \u2014
p346
aVthen we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.
p347
aVAnd so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,
p348
aVif we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.
p349
aVAnd so computation is some very powerful way
p350
aVto reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,
p351
aVto reduce the size of the genome that you're building.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea
p354
aVabout computers building computers.
p355
aVIf you look at the square that you build with the origami
p356
aVand some counters growing off it,
p357
aVthe pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need
p358
aVto make a memory.
p359
aVSo if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles \u2014
p360
aVrather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles \u2014
p361
aVthen they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,
p362
aVthe demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.
p363
aVSo you can actually make a complicated circuit
p364
aVusing a little bit of computation.
p365
aVIt's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.
p366
aVNow, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?
p367
aVExperimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.
p368
aVHere is a DNA origami rectangle,
p369
aVand here are some tiles growing from it.
p370
aVAnd you can see how they count.
p371
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
p372
aVSo it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VSo, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,
p376
aVand that's about the time constant for how long it takes
p377
aVto do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
p378
aVWe've got ideas about how to fix these errors.
p379
aVAnd I think in the next five or 10 years,
p380
aVwe'll make the kind of squares that I described
p381
aVand maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?
p384
aVI want you to remember that
p385
aVto create life's very diverse and complex forms,
p386
aVlife uses computation to do that.
p387
aVAnd the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,
p388
aVand in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,
p389
aVas Feynman said, you know,
p390
aVwe need to build something to understand it.
p391
aVAnd so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,
p392
aVrebuild everything from the bottom up,
p393
aVusing DNA in ways that nature never intended,
p394
aVusing DNA origami,
p395
aVand DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.
p396
aa(lp397
VYou know, so this is all very cool,
p398
aVbut what I'd like you to take from the talk,
p399
aVhopefully from some of those big questions,
p400
aVis that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.
p401
aVIt's not just making about \u2014
p402
aVit's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.
p403
aVWhat it's really about is taking computer science
p404
aVand looking at big questions in a new light,
p405
aVasking new versions of those big questions
p406
aVand trying to understand how biology
p407
aVcan make such amazing things. Thank you.
