VImagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft.
p4
aVImagine a plane full of smoke.
p5
aVImagine an engine going clack, clack, clack.
p6
aVIt sounds scary.
p7
aa(lp8
VWell, I had a unique seat that day.
p9
aVI was sitting in 1D.
p10
aVI was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.
p11
aVSo I looked at them right away,
p12
aVand they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."
p13
aVThe pilot had already turned the plane around,
p14
aVand we weren't that far.
p15
aVYou could see Manhattan.
p16
aVTwo minutes later,
p17
aVthree things happened at the same time.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.
p20
aVThat's usually not the route.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VHe turns off the engines.
p25
aVNow, imagine being in a plane with no sound.
p26
aVAnd then he says three words.
p27
aVThe most unemotional three words I've ever heard.
p28
aVHe says, "Brace for impact."
p29
aVI didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VI could see in her eyes, it was terror.
p34
aVLife was over.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
p37
aVI learned that it all changes in an instant.
p38
aVWe have this bucket list,
p39
aVwe have these things we want to do in life,
p40
aVand I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,
p41
aVall the fences I wanted to mend,
p42
aVall the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
p43
aVAs I thought about that later on,
p44
aVI came up with a saying,
p45
aVwhich is, "I collect bad wines."
p46
aVBecause if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
p47
aVI no longer want to postpone anything in life.
p48
aVAnd that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe second thing I learned that day \u2014
p51
aVand this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,
p52
aVwhich was by not a lot \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VI thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.
p57
aVI've lived a good life.
p58
aVIn my own humanity and mistakes,
p59
aVI've tried to get better at everything I tried.
p60
aVBut in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.
p61
aVAnd I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter
p62
aVwith people that matter.
p63
aVAnd I thought about my relationship with my wife,
p64
aVwith my friends, with people.
p65
aVAnd after, as I reflected on that,
p66
aVI decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
p67
aVIt's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
p68
aVI've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
p69
aVIt feels great.
p70
aVI no longer try to be right;
p71
aVI choose to be happy.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe third thing I learned \u2014
p74
aVand this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13."
p75
aVYou can see the water coming.
p76
aVI'm saying, "Please blow up."
p77
aVI don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces
p78
aVlike you've seen in those documentaries.
p79
aVAnd as we're coming down,
p80
aVI had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
p81
aVIt's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
p82
aVBut it was very sad.
p83
aVI didn't want to go; I love my life.
p84
aVAnd that sadness really framed in one thought,
p85
aVwhich is, I only wish for one thing.
p86
aVI only wish I could see my kids grow up.
p87
aVAbout a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter \u2014
p88
aVfirst-grader, not much artistic talent \u2014
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VYet!
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid.
p97
aVAnd it made all the sense in the world to me.
p98
aVI realized at that point, by connecting those two dots,
p99
aVthat the only thing that matters in my life
p100
aVis being a great dad.
p101
aVAbove all, above all,
p102
aVthe only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.
p103
aa(lp104
VI was given the gift of a miracle,
p105
aVof not dying that day.
p106
aVI was given another gift,
p107
aVwhich was to be able to see into the future
p108
aVand come back
p109
aVand live differently.
p110
aVI challenge you guys that are flying today,
p111
aVimagine the same thing happens on your plane \u2014
p112
aVand please don't \u2014
p113
aVbut imagine, and how would you change?
p114
aVWhat would you get done
p115
aVthat you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?
p116
aVHow would you change your relationships
p117
aVand the negative energy in them?
p118
aVAnd more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?
p119
aa(lp120
VThank you.
