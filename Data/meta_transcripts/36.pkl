VLet me show you some images
p4
aVof what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.
p5
aVSo, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.
p6
aVThis is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park
p7
aVin Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.
p8
aVThis is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela
p9
aVin Rio de Janeiro.
p10
aVAnd this is Sultanbelyi,
p11
aVwhich is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.
p12
aVThey are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,
p13
aVthe new urban world.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, why do I say that?
p16
aVTo tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,
p17
aVhis name is Julius.
p18
aVAnd I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.
p19
aVSo, I had been there almost three months,
p20
aVand I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas
p21
aVand Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed
p22
aVand at certain points we were walking around,
p23
aVhe grabbed my hand for support,
p24
aVwhich is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.
p25
aVThey're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.
p26
aVAnd I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,
p27
aVand he's one of many.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, close to 200,000 people a day
p30
aVmigrate from the rural to the urban areas.
p31
aVThat's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians
p32
aVwho talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,
p33
aVbut almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,
p34
aVand we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,
p35
aVclose to 70 million people a year.
p36
aVAnd if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.
p37
aVSo, that'll be \u2014 in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,
p38
aVbetween two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.
p39
aVAnd here are the statistics.
p40
aVToday \u2014 a billion squatters,
p41
aVone in six people on the planet.
p42
aV2030 \u2014 two billion squatters,
p43
aVone in four people on the planet.
p44
aVAnd the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,
p45
aVbetter than one in three people on earth.
p46
aVSo, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd I was thinking this morning of the good life,
p49
aVand before I show you the rest of my presentation,
p50
aVI'm going to violate TED rules here,
p51
aVand I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.
p52
aVBecause I think it says something about reversing our perception
p53
aVof what we think the good life is.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo \u2014 "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
p56
aVIt was a 10 by 10 cell.
p57
aVArmstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.
p58
aVArmstrong and his friends had no water \u2014
p59
aVthey bought it from a nearby tap owner \u2014
p60
aVno toilet \u2014 the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine \u2014
p61
aVand no sewers or sanitation.
p62
aVThey did have electricity,
p63
aVbut it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,
p64
aVand could only power one feeble bulb.
p65
aVThis was Southland, a small shanty community
p66
aVon the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.
p67
aVBut it could've been anywhere in the city,
p68
aVbecause more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.
p69
aV1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts
p70
aVwith no services, no toilets, no rights.
p71
aa(lp72
V"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:
p73
aVthey paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,
p74
aVa relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,
p75
aVand they could not afford to be late with the money.
p76
aV'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen
p77
aVand bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.
p78
aV'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,
p79
aVwho was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction
p80
aVthat is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.
p81
aVThey called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person
p82
aVwho has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.
p83
aVHilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;
p84
aVthe sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;
p85
aVand we perspired as we ate.
p86
aa(lp87
V"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,
p88
aVput on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.
p89
aVOutside a mound of garbage formed the border
p90
aVbetween Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.
p91
aVIt was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.
p92
aVAnd it was set in a wider watery ooze.
p93
aVAs we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.
p94
aVThey couldn't have been more than five or six years old.
p95
aVThey were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck
p96
aVsending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.
p97
aVI thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.
p98
aVOnce atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,
p99
aVsquatted, and defecated.
p100
aVThe flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
p101
aVWhen 20 families \u2014 100 people or so \u2014 share a single latrine,
p102
aVa boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.
p103
aVBut it stood in jarring contrast
p104
aVto something Armstrong had said as we were eating \u2014
p105
aVthat he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.
p106
aa(lp107
V"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.
p108
aVInstead, the human spirit radiated out
p109
aVfrom the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something
p110
aVno legal neighborhood could: freedom.
p111
aV'This place is very addictive,' he had said.
p112
aV'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.
p113
aVNobody is controlling what you do.
p114
aVOnce you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'
p115
aVHe meant back beyond that mountain of trash,
p116
aVback in the legal city, of legal buildings,
p117
aVwith legal leases and legal rights.
p118
aV'Once you have stayed here,' he said,
p119
aV'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,
p124
aVlittle more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.
p125
aVThis is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.
p126
aVThis is home improvement:
p127
aVputting plastic tarps on your roof.
p128
aa(lp129
VThis is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?
p130
aVWe're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,
p131
aVand plaster over the brick, some color,
p132
aVand this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.
p133
aVHe's got a fence; he scavenged a door;
p134
aVhe's got new tile on the roof.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd then you get Rocinha
p137
aVand you can see that it's getting even better.
p138
aVThe buildings here are multi-story.
p139
aVThey develop \u2014 you can see on the far right
p140
aVone where it seems to just stack on top of each other,
p141
aVroom, after room, after room.
p142
aVAnd what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,
p143
aVand they sell their loggia or roof rights,
p144
aVand someone else builds on top of their building,
p145
aVand then that person sells the roof rights,
p146
aVand someone else builds on top of their building.
p147
aVAll of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built
p150
aVto a higher level of design.
p151
aVThe crud in the front is mattress stuffing,
p152
aVand you see that all over Turkey.
p153
aVPeople dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.
p154
aVBut the green building, on behind,
p155
aVyou can see that the top floor is not occupied,
p156
aVso people are building with the possibility of expansion.
p157
aVAnd it's built to a pretty high standard of design.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd then you finally get squatter homes like this,
p160
aVwhich is built on the suburban model.
p161
aVHey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.
p162
aVThat's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
p163
aVThey're quite vital places, these communities.
p164
aa(lp165
VThis is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,
p166
aVand there's a bus route that runs through it,
p167
aVlots of people out on the street.
p168
aVThese communities in these cities are actually more vital
p169
aVthan the illegal communities.
p170
aVThey have more things going on in them.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" \u2014
p173
aVthese are how you get around the community.
p174
aVIt's on very steep ground.
p175
aVThey're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,
p176
aVand you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.
p177
aVSo, that's just a rock in the hillside.
p178
aVAnd these becos are normally very crowded,
p179
aVand people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,
p180
aVall sorts of things.
p181
aVBeer is all carried in on your shoulders.
p182
aVBeer is a very important thing in Brazil.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,
p185
aVso close to the train tracks that the merchants
p186
aVsometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.
p187
aVThis is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,
p188
aVlots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.
p189
aVThose green things in the foreground are mangoes.
p190
aa(lp191
VThis is a shopping street in Kibera,
p192
aVand you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,
p193
aVtwo beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.
p194
aVIt's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.
p195
aVThis here, on the right-hand side,
p196
aVis what's called a \u2014 if you look at the fine print under the awning \u2014
p197
aVit's a hotel.
p198
aVAnd what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.
p199
aVSo, that's a restaurant.
p200
aa(lp201
VPeople steal electrical power \u2014 this is Rio.
p202
aVPeople tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"
p203
aVand they steal the electrical power
p204
aVand wire the neighborhood.
p205
aVPeople burn trash to get rid of the garbage,
p206
aVand they dig their own sewer channels.
p207
aVTalk about more plastic bags than plankton.
p208
aVAnd sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.
p209
aVAnd when they have more money they cement their streets,
p210
aVand they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.
p211
aVThis is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,
p212
aVand that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:
p213
aVthey steal electricity; they install a pump
p214
aVand they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,
p217
aVto the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?
p218
aVI say there are two things.
p219
aVOne is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.
p220
aVThat does not necessarily mean property rights,
p221
aVand I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,
p222
aVbecause property rights create a lot of complications.
p223
aVThey're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt
p224
aVand have to pay back the debt,
p225
aVand sometimes have to sell their property
p226
aVin order to pay back the debt.
p227
aVThere's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights
p228
aVsometimes don't work in these cases,
p229
aVbut they do need security of tenure.
p230
aVAnd they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.
p231
aVThat can mean community organizing from below,
p232
aVbut it can also mean possibilities from above.
p233
aVAnd I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.
p234
aa(lp235
VTurkey has two great laws that protect squatters.
p236
aVOne is that \u2014 it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,
p237
aVwhich means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight
p238
aVin Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,
p239
aVif they don't catch you during the night.
p240
aVAnd the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people
p241
aVin the community, you can petition the government
p242
aVto be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.
p243
aVAnd when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.
p244
aVYou're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,
p245
aVprovide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo, these are the civic leaders of the future.
p248
aVThe woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.
p249
aVShe lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.
p250
aVThat's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family
p251
aVon the tent along the same highway median.
p252
aVThey're very outspoken. They're very active.
p253
aVThey can be community leaders.
p254
aVThis woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.
p255
aVAnd there were three old ladies who lived in \u2014
p256
aVthat's her self-built house behind her \u2014 and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,
p257
aVand they are the backbone of the community there.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis is Richard Muthama Peter,
p260
aVand he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.
p261
aVHe makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,
p262
aVand the people in the neighborhood,
p263
aVand is a great resource in the community.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,
p266
aVthe fruit merchant with his two kids here,
p267
aVand a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe future of these communities is in the people
p270
aVand in our ability to work with those people.
p271
aVSo, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,
p272
aVfrom what Armstrong said, and from all these people,
p273
aVis that these are neighborhoods.
p274
aVThe issue is not urban poverty.
p275
aVThe issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.
p276
aVThe issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods \u2014
p277
aVthis is a legitimate form of urban development \u2014
p278
aVand that cities have to engage these residents,
p279
aVbecause they are building the cities of the future.
