VHello. My name is Birke Baehr,
p4
aVand I'm 11 years old.
p5
aVI came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.
p6
aVFirst of all, I would like to say
p7
aVthat I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe
p8
aVall the marketing and advertising
p9
aVon TV, at public schools
p10
aVand pretty much everywhere else you look.
p11
aVIt seems to me like corporations
p12
aVare always trying to get kids, like me,
p13
aVto get their parents to buy stuff
p14
aVthat really isn't good for us or the planet.
p15
aVLittle kids, especially,
p16
aVare attracted by colorful packaging
p17
aVand plastic toys.
p18
aVI must admit, I used to be one of them.
p19
aVI also used to think that all of our food
p20
aVcame from these happy, little farms
p21
aVwhere pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat I discovered was this is not true.
p24
aVI began to look into this stuff
p25
aVon the Internet, in books and in documentary films,
p26
aVin my travels with my family.
p27
aVI discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.
p28
aVFirst, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.
p29
aVThat is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory
p30
aVto do something not intended by nature \u2014
p31
aVlike taking the DNA of a fish
p32
aVand putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.
p33
aVDon't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,
p34
aVbut this is just creepy.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVThe seeds are then planted, then grown.
p37
aVThe food they produce have been proven
p38
aVto cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,
p39
aVand people have been eating food produced this way
p40
aVsince the 1990s.
p41
aVAnd most folks don't even know they exist.
p42
aVDid you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn
p43
aVhad developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?
p44
aVThese include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
p45
aVYet almost all the corn we eat
p46
aVhas been altered genetically in some way.
p47
aVAnd let me tell you,
p48
aVcorn is in everything.
p49
aVAnd don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations
p50
aVcalled CAFOS.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VConventional farmers use chemical fertilizers
p55
aVmade from fossil fuels
p56
aVthat they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.
p57
aVThey do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients
p58
aVfrom growing the same crop over and over again.
p59
aVNext, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,
p60
aVlike pesticides and herbicides,
p61
aVto kill weeds and bugs.
p62
aVWhen it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,
p63
aVor run off into our waterways,
p64
aVpoisoning our water too.
p65
aVThen they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,
p66
aVso it can travel thousands of miles
p67
aVfrom where it's grown to the supermarkets.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo I ask myself,
p70
aVhow can I change? How can I change these things?
p71
aVThis is what I found out.
p72
aVI discovered that there's a movement for a better way.
p73
aVNow a while back,
p74
aVI wanted to be an NFL football player.
p75
aVI decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.
p76
aV(Applause)
p77
aVThank you.
p78
aVAnd that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
p79
aVThis man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer
p80
aVbecause he grows against the system.
p81
aVSince I'm home-schooled,
p82
aVI went to go hear him speak one day.
p83
aVThis man, this "lunatic farmer,"
p84
aVdoesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,
p85
aVor genetically modified seeds.
p86
aVAnd so for that, he's called crazy by the system.
p87
aa(lp88
VI want you to know that we can all make a difference
p89
aVby making different choices,
p90
aVby buying our food directly from local farmers,
p91
aVor our neighbors who we know in real life.
p92
aVSome people say organic or local food is more expensive,
p93
aVbut is it really?
p94
aVWith all these things I've been learning about the food system,
p95
aVit seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,
p96
aVor we can pay the hospital.
p97
aV(Applause)
p98
aVNow I know definitely which one I would choose.
p99
aVI want you to know that there are farms out there \u2014
p100
aVlike Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee \u2014
p101
aVwhose cows do eat grass
p102
aVand whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.
p103
aVSometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,
p104
aVso I can see up close and personal
p105
aVwhere the meat I eat comes from.
p106
aVI want you to know that I believe
p107
aVkids will eat fresh vegetables and good food
p108
aVif they know more about it and where it really comes from.
p109
aVI want you to know that there are farmers' markets
p110
aVin every community popping up.
p111
aVI want you to know that me, my brother and sister
p112
aVactually like eating baked kale chips.
p113
aVI try to share this everywhere I go.
p114
aa(lp115
VNot too long ago,
p116
aVmy uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.
p117
aVHe asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's
p118
aVor the sugarcoated flakes \u2014
p119
aVyou know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
p120
aVMy little cousin told his dad
p121
aVthat he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal
p122
aVbecause Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.
p123
aVAnd that, my friends, is how we can make a difference
p124
aVone kid at a time.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo next time you're at the grocery store, think local,
p127
aVchoose organic, know your farmer and know your food.
p128
aVThank you.
