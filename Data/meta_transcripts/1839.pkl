V"Iran is Israel's best friend,
p4
aVand we do not intend to change our position
p5
aVin relation to Tehran."
p6
aa(lp7
VBelieve it or not, this is a quote
p8
aVfrom an Israeli prime minister,
p9
aVbut it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir
p10
aVfrom the era of the Shah.
p11
aVIt's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.
p12
aVThe year is 1987.
p13
aVAyatollah Khomeini is still alive,
p14
aVand much like Ahmadinejad today,
p15
aVhe's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.
p16
aVYet, Rabin referred to Iran
p17
aVas a geostrategic friend.
p18
aa(lp19
VToday, when we hear the threats of war
p20
aVand the high rhetoric,
p21
aVwe're oftentimes led to believe
p22
aVthat this is yet another one of those unsolvable
p23
aVMiddle Eastern conflicts
p24
aVwith roots as old as the region itself.
p25
aVNothing could be further from the truth,
p26
aVand I hope today to show you why that is.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people
p29
aVthroughout history has actually been quite positive,
p30
aVstarting in 539 B.C.,
p31
aVwhen King Cyrus the Great of Persia
p32
aVliberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.
p33
aVA third of the Jewish population
p34
aVstayed in Babylonia.
p35
aVThey're today's Iraqi Jews.
p36
aVA third migrated to Persia.
p37
aVThey're today's Iranian Jews,
p38
aVstill 25,000 of them living in Iran,
p39
aVmaking them the largest Jewish community
p40
aVin the Middle East outside of Israel itself.
p41
aVAnd a third returned to historic Palestine,
p42
aVdid the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,
p43
aVfinanced, incidentally, by Persian tax money.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut even in modern times,
p46
aVrelations have been close at times.
p47
aVRabin's statement was a reflection
p48
aVof decades of security and intelligence collaboration
p49
aVbetween the two, which in turn
p50
aVwas born out of perception of common threats.
p51
aVBoth states feared the Soviet Union
p52
aVand strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.
p53
aVAnd, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,
p54
aVthe idea that Israel's security was best achieved
p55
aVby creating alliances with the non-Arab states
p56
aVin the periphery of the region
p57
aVin order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.
p58
aVNow, from the Shah's perspective, though,
p59
aVhe wanted to keep this as secret as possible,
p60
aVso when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,
p61
aVtraveled to Iran in the '70s,
p62
aVhe usually wore a wig
p63
aVso that no one would recognize him.
p64
aVThe Iranians built a special tarmac
p65
aVat the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,
p66
aVso that no one would notice the large number
p67
aVof Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution
p70
aVin 1979?
p71
aVIn spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology
p72
aVof the new regime, the geopolitical logic
p73
aVfor their collaboration lived on,
p74
aVbecause they still had common threats.
p75
aVAnd when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,
p76
aVIsrael feared an Iraqi victory
p77
aVand actively helped Iran by selling it arms
p78
aVand providing it with spare parts
p79
aVfor Iran's American weaponry
p80
aVat a moment when Iran was very vulnerable
p81
aVbecause of an American arms embargo
p82
aVthat Israel was more than happy to violate.
p83
aVIn fact, back in the 1980s,
p84
aVit was Israel that lobbied Washington
p85
aVto talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,
p86
aVand not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.
p87
aVAnd this, of course, climaxed
p88
aVin the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut with the end of the Cold War
p91
aVcame also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.
p92
aVSuddenly, the two common threats
p93
aVthat had pushed them closer together throughout decades,
p94
aVmore or less evaporated.
p95
aVThe Soviet Union collapsed,
p96
aVIraq was defeated,
p97
aVand a new environment was created in the region
p98
aVin which both of them felt more secure,
p99
aVbut they were also now left unchecked.
p100
aVWithout Iraq balancing Iran,
p101
aVIran could now become a threat,
p102
aVsome in Israel argued.
p103
aVIn fact, the current dynamic
p104
aVthat you see between Iran and Israel
p105
aVhas its roots more so
p106
aVin the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region
p107
aVafter the Cold War
p108
aVthan in the events of 1979,
p109
aVbecause at this point, Iran and Israel
p110
aVemerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,
p111
aVand rather than viewing each other
p112
aVas potential security partners,
p113
aVthey increasingly came to view each other
p114
aVas rivals and competitors.
p115
aVSo Israel, who in the 1980s
p116
aVlobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations
p117
aVnow feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,
p118
aVthinking that it would come
p119
aVat Israel's security interests' expense,
p120
aVand instead sought to put Iran
p121
aVin increased isolation.
p122
aa(lp123
VIronically, this was happening at a time
p124
aVwhen Iran was more interested
p125
aVin peacemaking with Washington
p126
aVthan to see to Israel's destruction.
p127
aVIran had put itself in isolation
p128
aVbecause of its radicalism,
p129
aVand after having helped the United States indirectly
p130
aVin the war against Iraq in 1991,
p131
aVthe Iranians were hoping
p132
aVthat they would be rewarded by being included
p133
aVin the post-war security architecture of the region.
p134
aVBut Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,
p135
aVas it would a decade later in Afghanistan,
p136
aVand instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,
p137
aVand it is at this point, around 1993, '94,
p138
aVthat Iran begins to translate
p139
aVits anti-Israeli ideology
p140
aVinto operational policy.
p141
aVThe Iranians believed that whatever they did,
p142
aVeven if they moderated their policies,
p143
aVthe U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,
p144
aVand the only way Iran could compel Washington
p145
aVto change its position was by imposing a cost
p146
aVon the U.S. if it didn't.
p147
aVThe easiest target was the peace process,
p148
aVand now the Iranian ideological bark
p149
aVwas to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,
p150
aVand Iran began supporting extensively
p151
aVPalestinian Islamist groups that it previously
p152
aVhad shunned.
p153
aVIn some ways, this sounds paradoxical,
p154
aVbut according to Martin Indyk
p155
aVof the Clinton administration,
p156
aVthe Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,
p157
aVbecause the more peace there would be
p158
aVbetween Israel and Palestine,
p159
aVthe U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.
p160
aVThe more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.
p161
aVSo according to Indyk, and these are his words,
p162
aVthe Iranians had an interest to do us in
p163
aVon the peace process
p164
aVin order to defeat our policy of containment.
p165
aVTo defeat our policy of containment,
p166
aVnot about ideology.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,
p169
aVall sides have reached out to each other.
p170
aVNetanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,
p171
aVreached out to the Iranians to see
p172
aVif there were any ways that
p173
aVthe doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.
p174
aVTehran was not interested.
p175
aVA few years later, the Iranians sent
p176
aVa comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,
p177
aVa proposal that revealed that there was some potential
p178
aVof getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.
p179
aVThe Bush administration did not even respond.
p180
aVAll sides have never missed an opportunity
p181
aVto miss an opportunity.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut this is not an ancient conflict.
p184
aVThis is not even an ideological conflict.
p185
aVThe ebbs and flows of hostility
p186
aVhave not shifted with ideological zeal,
p187
aVbut rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.
p188
aVWhen Iran and Israel's security imperatives
p189
aVdictated collaboration, they did so
p190
aVin spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.
p191
aVWhen Iran's ideological impulses collided
p192
aVwith its strategic interests,
p193
aVthe strategic interests always prevailed.
p194
aVThis is good news, because it means
p195
aVthat neither war nor enmity
p196
aVis a foregone conclusion.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut some want war.
p199
aVSome believe or say that it's 1938,
p200
aVIran is Germany,
p201
aVand Ahmadinejad is Hitler.
p202
aVIf we accept this to be true,
p203
aVthat indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,
p204
aVAhmadinejad is Hitler,
p205
aVthen the question we have to ask ourself is,
p206
aVwho wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?
p207
aVWho will risk peace?
p208
aVThis is an analogy that is deliberately aimed
p209
aVat eliminating diplomacy,
p210
aVand when you eliminate diplomacy,
p211
aVyou make war inevitable.
p212
aVIn an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,
p213
aVno draw, no compromise,
p214
aVonly victory or defeat.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut rather than making war inevitable
p217
aVby viewing this as ideological,
p218
aVwe would be wise to seek ways
p219
aVto make peace possible.
p220
aVIran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,
p221
aVonly a few decades old
p222
aVin a history of 2,500 years,
p223
aVand precisely because its roots are geopolitical,
p224
aVit means that solutions can be found,
p225
aVcompromises can be struck,
p226
aVhowever difficult it yet may be.
p227
aVAfter all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,
p228
aV"You don't make peace with your friends.
p229
aVYou make it with your enemies."
p230
