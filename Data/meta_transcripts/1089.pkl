VSo I was born
p4
aVon the last day
p5
aVof the last year of the '70s.
p6
aVI was raised on "Free to be you and me" \u2014
p7
aV(cheering)
p8
aVhip-hop \u2014
p9
aVnot as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.
p10
aVThank you. Thank you for hip-hop \u2014
p11
aVand Anita Hill.
p12
aV(Cheering)
p13
aVMy parents were radicals \u2014
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVwho became,
p16
aVwell, grown-ups.
p17
aVMy dad facetiously says,
p18
aV"We wanted to save the world,
p19
aVand instead we just got rich."
p20
aVWe actually just got "middle class"
p21
aVin Colorado Springs, Colorado,
p22
aVbut you get the picture.
p23
aVI was raised with a very heavy sense
p24
aVof unfinished legacy.
p25
aa(lp26
VAt this ripe old age of 30,
p27
aVI've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up
p28
aVin this horrible, beautiful time,
p29
aVand I've decided, for me,
p30
aVit's been a real journey and paradox.
p31
aVThe first paradox
p32
aVis that growing up is about rejecting the past
p33
aVand then promptly reclaiming it.
p34
aVFeminism was the water I grew up in.
p35
aVWhen I was just a little girl,
p36
aVmy mom started what is now
p37
aVthe longest-running women's film festival in the world.
p38
aVSo while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,
p39
aVI was watching very esoteric documentaries
p40
aVmade by and about women.
p41
aVYou can see how this had an influence.
p42
aVBut she was not the only feminist in the house.
p43
aa(lp44
VMy dad actually resigned
p45
aVfrom the male-only business club in my hometown
p46
aVbecause he said he would never be part of an organization
p47
aVthat would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aVHe's actually here today.
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aVThe trick here
p52
aVis my brother would become an experimental poet,
p53
aVnot a businessman,
p54
aVbut the intention was really good.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VIn any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,
p59
aVeven though it was all around me,
p60
aVbecause I associated it with my mom's women's groups,
p61
aVher swishy skirts and her shoulder pads \u2014
p62
aVnone of which had much cachet
p63
aVin the hallways of Palmer High School
p64
aVwhere I was trying to be cool at the time.
p65
aVBut I suspected there was something really important
p66
aVabout this whole feminism thing,
p67
aVso I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves
p68
aVand picking books off and reading them \u2014
p69
aVnever, of course, admitting that I was doing so.
p70
aVI didn't actually claim the feminist label
p71
aVuntil I went to Barnard College
p72
aVand I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.
p73
aVThey were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."
p74
aVSo what very profound epiphany, you might ask,
p75
aVwas responsible for my feminist click moment?
p76
aVFishnet stockings.
p77
aVJennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.
p78
aVI thought they were really hot.
p79
aVI decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.
p80
aVNow I tell you this \u2014
p81
aVI tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,
p82
aVbecause I think part of the work of feminism
p83
aVis to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,
p84
aVthat fun do matter.
p85
aVThere are lots of very modern political movements
p86
aVthat have caught fire in no small part
p87
aVbecause of cultural hipness.
p88
aVAnyone heard of these two guys as an example?
p89
aa(lp90
VSo my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,
p91
aVbut it looks very different.
p92
aVMy mom says, "patriarchy."
p93
aVI say, "intersectionality."
p94
aVSo race, class, gender, ability,
p95
aVall of these things go into our experiences
p96
aVof what it means to be a woman.
p97
aVPay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.
p98
aVBut for me, so is immigration. (Applause)
p99
aVThank you.
p100
aVMy mom says, "Protest march."
p101
aVI say, "Online organizing."
p102
aVI co-edit, along with a collective
p103
aVof other super-smart, amazing women,
p104
aVa site called Feministing.com.
p105
aVWe are the most widely read feminist publication ever,
p106
aVand I tell you this
p107
aVbecause I think it's really important to see
p108
aVthat there's a continuum.
p109
aa(lp110
VFeminist blogging is basically the 21st century version
p111
aVof consciousness raising.
p112
aVBut we also have a straightforward political impact.
p113
aVFeministing has been able
p114
aVto get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.
p115
aVWe got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail
p116
aVfired from a Big Ten school.
p117
aVAnd one of our biggest successes
p118
aVis we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa
p119
aVwho say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.
p120
aVI realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."
p121
aVSo we're able to pull in the next generation
p122
aVin a totally new way.
p123
aa(lp124
VMy mom says, "Gloria Steinem."
p125
aVI say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,
p126
aVMiriam Perez, Ann Friedman,
p127
aVJessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,
p128
aVand on and on and on and on."
p129
aVWe don't want one hero.
p130
aVWe don't want one icon.
p131
aVWe don't want one face.
p132
aVWe are thousands of women and men across this country
p133
aVdoing online writing, community organizing,
p134
aVchanging institutions from the inside out \u2014
p135
aVall continuing the incredible work
p136
aVthat our mothers and grandmothers started.
p137
aVThank you.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VWhich brings me to the second paradox:
p142
aVsobering up about our smallness
p143
aVand maintaining faith in our greatness
p144
aVall at once.
p145
aVMany in my generation \u2014
p146
aVbecause of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education \u2014
p147
aVwere socialized to believe
p148
aVthat we were special little snowflakes \u2014
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVwho were going to go out and save the world.
p151
aVThese are three words many of us were raised with.
p152
aVWe walk across graduation stages,
p153
aVhigh on our overblown expectations,
p154
aVand when we float back down to earth,
p155
aVwe realize we don't know what the heck it means
p156
aVto actually save the world anyway.
p157
aVThe mainstream media often paints my generation
p158
aVas apathetic,
p159
aVand I think it's much more accurate
p160
aVto say we are deeply overwhelmed.
p161
aVAnd there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair \u2014
p162
aVan environmental crisis,
p163
aVwealth disparity in this country
p164
aVunlike we've seen since 1928,
p165
aVand globally,
p166
aVa totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.
p167
aVXenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.
p168
aVIt's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.
p169
aa(lp170
VI experienced this firsthand myself
p171
aVwhen I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.
p172
aVI was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.
p173
aVI went out and I worked at a non-profit,
p174
aVI went to grad school, I phone-banked,
p175
aVI protested, I volunteered,
p176
aVand none of it seemed to matter.
p177
aVAnd on a particularly dark night
p178
aVof December of 2004,
p179
aVI sat down with my family,
p180
aVand I said that I had become very disillusioned.
p181
aVI admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy \u2014 kind of a dark fantasy \u2014
p182
aVof writing a letter
p183
aVabout everything that was wrong with the world
p184
aVand then lighting myself on fire
p185
aVon the White House steps.
p186
aVMy mom
p187
aVtook a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,
p188
aVher eyes really welled with tears,
p189
aVand she looked right at me and she said,
p190
aV"I will not stand
p191
aVfor your desperation."
p192
aVShe said, "You are smarter, more creative
p193
aVand more resilient than that."
p194
aa(lp195
VWhich brings me to my third paradox.
p196
aVGrowing up is about aiming to succeed wildly
p197
aVand being fulfilled by failing really well.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aV(Applause)
p200
aVThere's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,
p201
aVand he writes that many of us are often whiplashed
p202
aV"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves
p203
aVand a servile underestimation of ourselves."
p204
aVYou may have guessed by now,
p205
aVI did not light myself on fire.
p206
aVI did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.
p207
aVI wrote the book I needed to read.
p208
aVI wrote a book about eight incredible people
p209
aVall over this country
p210
aVdoing social justice work.
p211
aVI wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,
p212
aVthe daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,
p213
aVwho's dedicating her life
p214
aVto environmental justice.
p215
aVI wrote about Emily Apt
p216
aVwho initially became a caseworker in the welfare system
p217
aVbecause she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,
p218
aVbut quickly learned, not only did she not like it,
p219
aVbut she wasn't really good at it.
p220
aVInstead, what she really wanted to do was make films.
p221
aVSo she made a film about the welfare system
p222
aVand had a huge impact.
p223
aVI wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,
p224
aVwho joined the military so she could afford college.
p225
aVShe was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp
p226
aVand went on to co-organize a group
p227
aVcalled the Service Women's Action Network.
p228
aa(lp229
VWhat I learned from these people and others
p230
aVwas that I couldn't judge them
p231
aVbased on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.
p232
aVMany of them are working in deeply intractable systems \u2014
p233
aVthe military, congress,
p234
aVthe education system, etc.
p235
aVBut what they managed to do within those systems
p236
aVwas be a humanizing force.
p237
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p238
aVwhat could possibly be more important than that?
p239
aVCornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.
p240
aVBut how good a failure is it?"
p241
aVThis isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.
p242
aVIt's to say we operate on two levels.
p243
aVOn one,
p244
aVwe really go after changing these broken systems
p245
aVof which we find ourselves a part.
p246
aVBut on the other, we root our self-esteem
p247
aVin the daily acts of trying to make one person's day
p248
aVmore kind, more just, etc.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo when I was a little girl,
p251
aVI had a couple of very strange habits.
p252
aVOne of them was
p253
aVI used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,
p254
aVand I would suck the thumb of my left hand
p255
aVand hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVI was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.
p258
aVShe was talking about board meetings,
p259
aVshe was founding peace organizations,
p260
aVshe was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends \u2014
p261
aVall these daily acts of care and creativity.
p262
aVAnd surely, at three and four years old,
p263
aVI was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,
p264
aVbut I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.
p265
aa(lp266
VThe activists I interviewed
p267
aVhad nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,
p268
aVwhich was that they all cited their mothers
p269
aVas their most looming and important
p270
aVactivist influences.
p271
aVSo often, particularly at a young age,
p272
aVwe look far afield
p273
aVfor our models of the meaningful life,
p274
aVand sometimes they're in our own kitchens,
p275
aVtalking on the phone, making us dinner,
p276
aVdoing all that keeps the world going around and around.
p277
aVMy mom and so many women like her
p278
aVhave taught me that life is not about glory,
p279
aVor certainty, or security even.
p280
aVIt's about embracing the paradox.
p281
aVIt's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
p282
aVAnd it's about loving people really well.
p283
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p284
aVthese things make for a lifetime
p285
aVof challenge and reward.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.
