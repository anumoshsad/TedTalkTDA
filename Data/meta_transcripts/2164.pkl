VGuatemala is recovering from a 36-year armed conflict.
p4
aVA conflict that was fought during the Cold War.
p5
aVIt was really just  a small leftist insurgency
p6
aVand a devastating response by the state.
p7
aVWhat we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims,
p8
aV160,000 of those killed in the communities:
p9
aVsmall children, men, women,  the elderly even.
p10
aVAnd then we have  about 40,000 others, the missing,
p11
aVthe ones we're still looking for today.
p12
aVWe call them the Desaparecidos.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, 83 percent of the victims  are Mayan victims,
p15
aVvictims that are the descendants
p16
aVof the original inhabitants of  Central America.
p17
aVAnd only about 17 percent are of  European descent.
p18
aVBut the most important thing here is that
p19
aVthe very people who are supposed to  defend us, the police, the military,
p20
aVare the ones that committed most of the crimes.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow the families, they want information.
p23
aVThey want to know what happened.
p24
aVThey want the bodies of their loved ones.
p25
aVBut most of all, what they want is they want you,
p26
aVthey want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, my case was that my father received death threats in 1980.
p29
aVAnd we left.
p30
aVWe left Guatemala and we came here.
p31
aVSo I grew up in New York,
p32
aVI grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact, and I went to New Utrecht High School
p33
aVand I graduated from Brooklyn College.
p34
aVThe only thing was that
p35
aVI really didn't know what  was happening in Guatemala.
p36
aVI didn't care for it; it was too painful.
p37
aVBut it wasn't till 1995 that I decided to do something about it.
p38
aVSo I went back.
p39
aVI went back to Guatemala,  to look for the bodies,
p40
aVto understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe way we work is that we give people information.
p43
aVWe talk to the family members and we let them choose.
p44
aVWe let them decide to tell us the stories,
p45
aVto tell us what they saw,
p46
aVto tell us about their loved ones.
p47
aVAnd even more important,
p48
aVwe let them choose to give us a piece of themselves.
p49
aVA piece, an essence, of who they are.
p50
aVAnd that DNA is what we're  going to compare
p51
aVto the DNA that comes from the skeletons.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhile we're doing that, though, we're looking for the bodies.
p54
aVAnd these are skeletons by now,
p55
aVmost of these crimes  happened 32 years ago.
p56
aVWhen we find the grave,
p57
aVwe take out the dirt and eventually clean  the body, document it, and exhume it.
p58
aVWe literally bring the  skeleton out of the ground.
p59
aa(lp60
VOnce we have those bodies, though, we take them back to the city, to our lab,
p61
aVand we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things:
p62
aVOne is how people died.
p63
aVSo here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head
p64
aVor a machete wound, for example.
p65
aVThe other thing we want to understand is who they are.
p66
aVWhether it's a baby,
p67
aVor an adult.
p68
aVWhether it's a woman or a man.
p69
aVBut when we're done with that analysis
p70
aVwhat we'll do is we'll take a small  fragment of the bone
p71
aVand we'll extract DNA from it.
p72
aVWe'll take that DNA
p73
aVand then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families, of course.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases.
p76
aVThe first is the case  of the military diary.
p77
aVNow this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999.
p78
aVAnd what you see there is the state following individuals,
p79
aVpeople that, like you,  wanted to change their country,
p80
aVand they jotted everything down.
p81
aVAnd one of the things that they wrote  down is when they executed them.
p82
aVInside that yellow rectangle,  you see a code,
p83
aVit's a secret code: 300.
p84
aVAnd then you see a date.
p85
aVThe 300 means "executed" and the date  means when they were executed.
p86
aVNow that's going to come into play in a second.
p87
aVWhat we did is we conducted an exhumation in 2003,
p88
aVwhere we exhumed 220 bodies from 53 graves in a military base.
p89
aVGrave 9, though, matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares.
p90
aVNow Sergio was a professor at the university.
p91
aVHe graduted from Iowa State University
p92
aVand went back to Guatemala to change his country.
p93
aVAnd he was captured on  February 23, 1984.
p94
aVAnd if you can see there, he was  executed on March 29, 1984,
p95
aVwhich was incredible.
p96
aVWe had the body, we had the family's  information and their DNA,
p97
aVand now we have documents that told us exactly what happened.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut most important is about two weeks later,
p100
aVwe go another hit, another match
p101
aVfrom the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.
p102
aVThe DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family.
p103
aVAnd then we noticed that he was also in the diary.
p104
aVBut it was amazing to see that he was  also executed on March 29, 1984.
p105
aVSo that led us to think, hmm,  how many bodies were in the grave?
p106
aVSix.
p107
aVSo then we said, how many people were executed on March 29, 1984?
p108
aVThat's right, six as well.
p109
aVSo we have Juan de Dios, Hugo, Moises and Zoilo.
p110
aVAll of them executed on the same date,  all captured at different locations
p111
aVand at different moments.
p112
aVAll put in that grave.
p113
aVThe only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families
p114
aVSo we went and we looked for them and we found them.
p115
aVAnd we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe other case I want to tell you about
p118
aVis that of a military base  called CREOMPAZ.
p119
aVIt actually means, "to believe in peace," but the acronym really means
p120
aVRegional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations.
p121
aVAnd this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries,
p122
aVthe ones that serve with the U.N.
p123
aVand go to countries like Haiti and the Congo.
p124
aVWell, we have testimony that said that within this military base,
p125
aVthere were bodies, there were graves.
p126
aVSo we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in,
p127
aVwe found the first of 84 graves,  a total of 533 bodies.
p128
aVNow, if you think about that,
p129
aVpeacekeepers being trained on top of bodies.
p130
aVIt's very ironic.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut the bodies \u2014 face down, most of them, hands tied behind their backs,
p133
aVblindfolded, all types of trauma \u2014
p134
aVthese were people who were defenseless who were being executed.
p135
aVPeople that 533 families are looking for.
p136
aVSo we're going to focus on Grave 15.
p137
aVGrave 15, what we noticed, was a grave full of women and children,
p138
aV63 of them.
p139
aVAnd that immediately made us think,
p140
aVmy goodness, where is there a case like this?
p141
aVWhen I got to Guatemala in 1995,
p142
aVI heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May 14, 1982,
p143
aVwhere the army came in, killed the men,
p144
aVand took the women and children  in helicopters to an unknown location.
p145
aVWell, guess what?
p146
aVThe clothing from this grave matched the  clothing from the region
p147
aVwhere these people were taken from,
p148
aVwhere these women and children  were taken from.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo we conducted some DNA analysis, and guess what?
p151
aVWe identified Martina Rojas  and Manuel Chen.
p152
aVBoth of them disappeared in that case, and now we could prove it.
p153
aVWe have physical evidence that proves that this happened
p154
aVand that those people  were taken to this base.
p155
aVNow, Manuel Chen was three years old.
p156
aVHis mother went to the river to wash  clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.
p157
aVThat's when the army came
p158
aVand that's when he was taken away in  a helicopter and never seen again
p159
aVuntil we found him in Grave 15.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo now with science, with archaeology,  with anthropology, with genetics,
p162
aVwhat we're doing is, we're giving a voice to the voiceless.
p163
aVBut we're doing more than that.
p164
aVWe're actually providing  evidence for trials,
p165
aVlike the genocide trial that happened  last year in Guatemala
p166
aVwhere General Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere \u2014
p169
aVit's happening in Mexico right in front of us today \u2014
p170
aVand we can't let it go on anymore.
p171
aVWe have to now come together and decide
p172
aVthat we're not going to have  any more missing.
p173
aVSo no more missing, guys.
p174
aVOkay? No more missing.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you.
