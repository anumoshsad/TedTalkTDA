VI have a confession.
p4
aVI have been in an affair
p5
aVsince I was 17 years old.
p6
aVI wish I could talk about butterflies in my stomach
p7
aVor maps I drew on the ground
p8
aVwhen I think about this affair,
p9
aVbut I cannot.
p10
aVI wish I could talk about sweet words spoken
p11
aVor gifts that I received
p12
aVfrom this affair,
p13
aVbut I cannot.
p14
aVAll I can tell you about is the aftermath,
p15
aVabout days I spent constantly asking:
p16
aVWhy, why, why me?
p17
aa(lp18
VI remember how it all began.
p19
aVI was in my final year of high school,
p20
aVand my class had just won in sports,
p21
aVso we were singing and dancing and hugging each other.
p22
aVI went and took a shower.
p23
aVThen I went for dinner.
p24
aVAnd when I sat down to eat,
p25
aVmy teeth started chattering,
p26
aVand so I couldn't put the spoon in my mouth.
p27
aVI rushed to the nurse's office,
p28
aVand because I couldn't talk, I just pointed at my mouth.
p29
aVShe didn't know what was happening,
p30
aVso she told me to lie down,
p31
aVand it worked \u2014
p32
aVafter a few minutes, the chattering stopped.
p33
aVI was about to dash out, and she told me \u2014
p34
aVno, she insisted \u2014 that I go up to the dormitories to sleep.
p35
aVHere I was in my final year of high school,
p36
aVjust a few months from doing my end of high school exams
p37
aVand a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks,"
p38
aVwhich are somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams.
p39
aVThere is no way I was going to sleep
p40
aVand let a set of exams mock me.
p41
aa(lp42
VI went to class, sat down,
p43
aVtook my Kenyan history notes,
p44
aVand there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,
p45
aVwith the great Mekatilili wa Menza,
p46
aVthe Giriama woman who led her people against British colonial rule.
p47
aVThen, without any notice,
p48
aVmy left hand started jerking,
p49
aVand it was as if I was marking imaginary papers.
p50
aVIn and out it went,
p51
aVand with every stroke, one by one,
p52
aVmy classmates stopped concentrating on their reading
p53
aVand started looking at me.
p54
aVAnd I tried really hard to stop it,
p55
aVbut I couldn't,
p56
aVbecause it had a life of its own.
p57
aVAnd then, when it was sure everybody was looking at us,
p58
aVin its final show and official introduction,
p59
aVI had my first full-blown seizure,
p60
aVwhich was the beginning of what has been a 15-year-long affair.
p61
aa(lp62
VSeizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy,
p63
aVand every first-ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor
p64
aVto determine if one has epilepsy
p65
aVor if it's a symptom of something else.
p66
aVIn my case, it was confirmed that I had epilepsy.
p67
aVI spent a large chunk of my time in hospital and at home,
p68
aVand only went back to do my final exams.
p69
aVI had seizures in between papers,
p70
aVbut managed to get good enough grades
p71
aVto be admitted for an actuarial science degree
p72
aVat the University of Nairobi.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VUnfortunately, I had to drop out in my second year.
p77
aVI didn't have good enough coping skills
p78
aVand a support community around me.
p79
aVI was lucky enough to get a job,
p80
aVbut I was fired from that job when I had a seizure in the workplace.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo I found myself in a space
p83
aVwhere I was constantly asking myself
p84
aVwhy this had to happen to me.
p85
aVI lived in denial for a long time,
p86
aVand the denial was maybe because of the things that had happened,
p87
aVdropping out of school and being fired from my job.
p88
aVOr maybe it was because of the things I had heard about epilepsy
p89
aVand about people living with epilepsy:
p90
aVthat they would never live on their own;
p91
aVthat they would never travel on their own
p92
aVor even get work;
p93
aVthat they were outcasts,
p94
aVwith a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd so the more I thought about these things,
p97
aVthe more my seizures became,
p98
aVand I spent days with my legs locked,
p99
aVmy speech became blurred
p100
aVand on days on end, this is how I'd be.
p101
aVTwo or three days after a seizure,
p102
aVmy head and my hand would still be twitching.
p103
aVI felt lost,
p104
aVlike I'd lost everything,
p105
aVand sometimes,
p106
aVeven the will to live.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Sigh)
p109
aa(lp110
VI had so much frustration in me.
p111
aVAnd so I started writing,
p112
aVbecause the people around me didn't have answers
p113
aVto the questions that I had.
p114
aVAnd so I wrote my fears
p115
aVand my doubts.
p116
aVI wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days,
p117
aVand I shared them on a blog.
p118
aVAnd before long,
p119
aVI began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy
p120
aVand their families,
p121
aVand even those who did not have the diagnosis.
p122
aVAnd I moved from that girl who constantly asked why me
p123
aVto one who not only self-advocates,
p124
aVbut does it for those who are yet to find their voices.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VMy seizures are greatly reduced, from two to three times a day,
p129
aVto sometimes two to three times in one year.
p130
aa(lp131
VI went on \u2014
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VI went on to employ five people,
p136
aVwhen I began what was Kenya's first
p137
aVfree mental health and epilepsy support line.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd I travel \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd I travel to speak about my affair,
p144
aVall these things that I had been told
p145
aVpeople like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do.
p146
aa(lp147
VEvery year, a population as big as 80 percent of Nairobi
p148
aVgets diagnosed with epilepsy
p149
aVacross the globe.
p150
aVAnd they, like me,
p151
aVgo through the emotions of stigma and exclusion.
p152
aVAnd so I have made it my life journey
p153
aVto keep these conversations going,
p154
aVand I keep confessing about my affair
p155
aVso that those people who do not have the diagnosis
p156
aVmight know and might have a constant reminder
p157
aVthat it is alright to engage with people like us,
p158
aVthat as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion,
p159
aVthat we, just like them,
p160
aVcan be able to take anything life throws at us.
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you.
