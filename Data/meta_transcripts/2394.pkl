VPat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot,
p4
aVand by the way, these two women,
p5
aVI'm very honored to say,
p6
aVhave been my friends for a very long time, too.
p7
aVJane Fonda: Yes we have.
p8
aa(lp9
VPM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship
p10
aVis something that Cervantes said.
p11
aVHe said, "You can tell a lot about someone,"
p12
aVin this case a woman,
p13
aV"by the company that she keeps."
p14
aVSo let's start with \u2014
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VJF: We're in big trouble.
p19
aa(lp20
VLily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,
p21
aVI'm extremely dry.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VJF: You're taking up our time.
p26
aVWe have a very limited \u2014
p27
aa(lp28
VLT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VJF: You ain't seen nothing yet.
p33
aVAnyway \u2014 sorry.
p34
aa(lp35
VPM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?
p36
aa(lp37
VLT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun,
p38
aVwho's audacious,
p39
aVwho's forthcoming, who has politics,
p40
aVwho has even a small scrap of passion for the planet,
p41
aVsomeone who's decent, has a sense of justice
p42
aVand who thinks I'm worthwhile.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
V(Applause)
p47
aa(lp48
VJF: You know, I was thinking this morning,
p49
aVI don't even know what I would do without my women friends.
p50
aVI mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."
p51
aa(lp52
VLT: (Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VJF: No, it's true.
p55
aVI exist because I have my women friends. They \u2014
p56
aVYou're one of them.
p57
aVI don't know about you. But anyway \u2014
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VYou know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter,
p62
aVthey make me braver.
p63
aVThey tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting.
p64
aVAnd most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.
p65
aVYou know? I mean, it's nice \u2014 LT: Thank you.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VJF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know \u2014
p70
aVit's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from
p71
aVwhen you're getting toward the end.
p72
aVI'm approaching \u2014 I'll be there sooner than you.
p73
aa(lp74
VLT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VJF: I'm showing you the way.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VLT: Well, you are and you have.
p83
aa(lp84
VPM: Well, as we grow older,
p85
aVand as we go through different kinds of life's journeys,
p86
aVwhat do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?
p87
aa(lp88
VLT: Well you have to use a lot of \u2014
p89
aa(lp90
VJF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that.
p91
aa(lp92
VLT: I have to use a lot of social media \u2014
p93
aVYou be quiet now. And so \u2014
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VLT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts
p98
aVto find my friends,
p99
aVso I can answer them as quickly as possible,
p100
aVbecause I know they need my counsel.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VThey need my support,
p105
aVbecause most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors,
p106
aVand you're all three ...
p107
aVand a long string of other descriptive phrases,
p108
aVand I want to get to you as soon as possible,
p109
aVI want you to know that I'm there for you.
p110
aa(lp111
VJF: Do you do emojis?
p112
aa(lp113
VLT: Oh ... JF: No?
p114
aa(lp115
VLT: That's embarrassing. JF: I'm really into emojis.
p116
aa(lp117
VLT: No, I spell out my \u2014
p118
aVI spell out my words of happiness and congratulations,
p119
aVand sadness.
p120
aa(lp121
VJF: You spell it right out \u2014
p122
aa(lp123
VLT: I spell it, every letter.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VJF: Such a purist.
p128
aVYou know, as I've gotten older,
p129
aVI've understood more the importance of friendships,
p130
aVand so, I really make an effort
p131
aVto reach out and make play dates \u2014 not let too much time go by.
p132
aVI read a lot
p133
aVso, as Lily knows all too well,
p134
aVmy books that I like, I send to my friends.
p135
aa(lp136
VLT: When we knew we would be here today
p137
aVyou sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships,
p138
aVand I was so surprised to see how many books,
p139
aVhow much research has been done recently \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
VJF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VPM: And \u2014
p146
aa(lp147
VLT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example
p148
aVof how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.
p149
aVThere's been very little research done on us,
p150
aVeven though we volunteered lots of times.
p151
aa(lp152
VJF: That's for sure.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VLT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this.
p157
aVThe Harvard Medical School study has shown
p158
aVthat women who have close female friendships
p159
aVare less likely to develop impairments \u2014
p160
aVphysical impairments as they age,
p161
aVand they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting \u2014
p162
aa(lp163
VJF: And longer \u2014
p164
aa(lp165
VLT: Joyful lives.
p166
aa(lp167
VJF: We live five years longer than men.
p168
aa(lp169
VLT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VLT: But the most important part is they found \u2014
p174
aVthe results were so exciting and so conclusive \u2014
p175
aVthe researchers found
p176
aVthat not having close female friends is detrimental to your health,
p177
aVas much as smoking or being overweight.
p178
aa(lp179
VJF: And there's something else, too \u2014
p180
aa(lp181
VLT: I've said my part, so ...
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VJF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing.
p186
aVBecause they only \u2014 for years, decades \u2014
p187
aVthey only researched men when they were trying to understand stress,
p188
aVonly very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed,
p189
aVand it turns out that when we're stressed \u2014 women,
p190
aVour bodies get flooded by oxytocin.
p191
aVWhich is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.
p192
aVWhich is also increased when we're with our women friends.
p193
aVAnd I do think that's one reason why we live longer.
p194
aVAnd I feel so bad for men because they don't have that.
p195
aVTestosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.
p196
aa(lp197
VLT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...
p198
aa(lp199
VJF: Oh \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
VLT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much,
p202
aVwe found we had so much in common and we're so different.
p203
aVHere she is, like Hollywood royalty,
p204
aVI'm like a tough kid from Detroit,
p205
aV[Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee,
p206
aVand we found we were so in sync as women,
p207
aVand we must have \u2014
p208
aVwe laughed \u2014 we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans.
p209
aa(lp210
VJF: I think \u2014 we sure crossed our legs a lot.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aVIf you know what I mean.
p214
aa(lp215
VLT: I think we all know what you mean.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VPM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.
p220
aVSo among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship
p221
aVwas one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister,
p222
aVwho said about female friendship
p223
aVthat women friends are not just a social act,
p224
aVthey're a spiritual act.
p225
aVDo you think of your friends as spiritual?
p226
aVDo they add something spiritual to your lives?
p227
aa(lp228
VLT: Spiritual \u2014 I absolutely think that.
p229
aVBecause \u2014 especially people you've known a long time,
p230
aVpeople you've spent time with \u2014
p231
aVI can see the spiritual essence inside them,
p232
aVthe tenderness, the vulnerability.
p233
aVThere's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship.
p234
aVI just see deeply into your soul.
p235
aa(lp236
VPM: Do you think that, Jane \u2014
p237
aa(lp238
VLT: But I have special powers.
p239
aa(lp240
VJF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.
p241
aVThere's business friends, and party friends,
p242
aVI've got a lot of those.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VBut the oxytocin-producing friendships have ...
p247
aVThey feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right?
p248
aVYou know, we go deep. And \u2014
p249
aVI find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends.
p250
aVNot because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.
p251
aa(lp252
VLT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VPM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aVAnd I always think, when women talk about their friendships,
p260
aVthat men always look a little mystified.
p261
aVWhat are the differences, in your opinion,
p262
aVbetween men friendships and women friendships?
p263
aa(lp264
VJF: There's a lot of difference,
p265
aVand I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men \u2014
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
Vthat they don't have what we have.
p270
aVWhich I think may be why they die sooner.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VI have a lot of compassion for men,
p275
aVbecause women, no kidding, we \u2014
p276
aVwomen's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep.
p277
aVThey're revelatory.
p278
aVWe risk vulnerability \u2014 this is something men don't do.
p279
aVI mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"
p280
aV"Did I really screw up there?"
p281
aa(lp282
VPM: You're doing great.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VJF: But I mean, we ask questions like that
p287
aVof our women friends,
p288
aVand men don't.
p289
aVYou know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face,
p290
aVwhereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.
p291
aa(lp292
VLT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions,
p293
aVthey want to bury deeper feelings.
p294
aVI mean, that's the general, conventional thought.
p295
aVThey would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls,
p296
aVor talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.
p297
aVI mean, it's just the kind of \u2014 it's a more manly behavior.
p298
aa(lp299
VJF: You meant \u2014 LT: They talk about sex.
p300
aVI meant they might have sex
p301
aVif they could get somebody in their man cave to \u2014
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VJF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting \u2014
p306
aVand again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently \u2014
p307
aVis that men are born every bit as relational as women are.
p308
aVIf you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls,
p309
aVyou'll see the baby boys just like the girls,
p310
aVgazing into their mother's eyes,
p311
aVyou know, needing that relational exchange of energy.
p312
aVWhen the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child,
p313
aVeven the boy would cry.
p314
aVThey need relationship.
p315
aVSo the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?
p316
aVAnd the answer is patriarchal culture,
p317
aVwhich says to boys and young men
p318
aVthat to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.
p319
aVThat a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need,
p320
aVthey don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
p321
aVThey don't ask for help.
p322
aVThere's a quote that I really like,
p323
aV"Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'."
p324
aVYou know, his sense of self.
p325
aVWhereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous.
p326
aVBut our "we" is our saving grace,
p327
aVit's what makes us strong.
p328
aVIt's not that we're better than men,
p329
aVwe just don't have our masculinity to prove.
p330
aa(lp331
VLT: And, well \u2014
p332
aa(lp333
VJF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.
p334
aVSo we can express our humanity \u2014 LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.
p335
aa(lp336
VJF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a \u2014
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VNo, but it's a great quote, I think.
p341
aVWe're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.
p342
aVAnd that's really important.
p343
aa(lp344
VLT: But men are so inculcated in the culture
p345
aVto be comfortable in the patriarchy.
p346
aVAnd we've got to make something different happen.
p347
aa(lp348
VJF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power.
p349
aa(lp350
VLT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.
p351
aVIt's because our friendships \u2014
p352
aVfemale friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood,
p353
aVand sisterhood can be a very powerful force,
p354
aVto give the world \u2014
p355
aVto make it what it should be \u2014
p356
aVthe things that humans desperately need.
p357
aa(lp358
VPM: It is why we're talking about it,
p359
aVbecause women's friendships are,
p360
aVas you said, Jane,
p361
aVa renewable source of power.
p362
aVSo how do we use that power?
p363
aa(lp364
VJF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world,
p365
aVespecially older women.
p366
aVAnd if we harness our power, we can change the world.
p367
aVAnd guess what? We need to.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Applause)
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd we need to do it soon.
p372
aVAnd one of the things that we need to do \u2014
p373
aVand we can do it as women \u2014
p374
aVfor one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards.
p375
aVWe need to consume less.
p376
aVWe in the Western world need to consume less
p377
aVand when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally,
p378
aVwhen we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally.
p379
aVWe are the ones that need to get off the grid.
p380
aVWe need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels.
p381
aVAnd the fossil fuel companies \u2014
p382
aVthe Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys \u2014
p383
aVcause they are \u2014
p384
aVare going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age.
p385
aVYou know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet,
p386
aVand that's not true.
p387
aVThere are countries in the world right now
p388
aVthat are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine.
p389
aVAnd they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel
p390
aVthat we're going to be back in the Stone Age,
p391
aVand in fact, if we begin to use renewable energy,
p392
aVand not drill in the Arctic, and not drill \u2014
p393
aa(lp394
VLT: Oh, boy.
p395
aa(lp396
VJF: And not drill in the Alberta tar sands \u2014
p397
aVRight.
p398
aVThat we will be \u2014
p399
aVthere will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being,
p400
aVand it's women that are going to lead the way.
p401
aa(lp402
VLT: Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement
p403
aVwith our sisterhood around the world,
p404
aVwith women we don't see, women we may never meet,
p405
aVbut we join together that way,
p406
aVbecause \u2014
p407
aVAristotle said \u2014
p408
aVmost people \u2014
p409
aVpeople would die without male friendships.
p410
aVAnd the operative word here was "male."
p411
aVBecause they thought that friendships should be between equals
p412
aVand women were not considered equal \u2014
p413
aa(lp414
VJF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks.
p415
aa(lp416
VLT: No, exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VAnd wait, no, here's the best part.
p421
aVIt's like, you know, men do need women now.
p422
aVThe planet needs women.
p423
aVThe US Constitution needs women.
p424
aVWe are not even in the Constitution.
p425
aa(lp426
VJF: You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment.
p427
aa(lp428
VLT: Right.
p429
aVJustice Ginsberg said something like \u2014
p430
aVevery constitution that's been written since the end of World War II
p431
aVincluded a provision that made women citizens of equal stature,
p432
aVbut ours does not.
p433
aVSo that would be a good place to start.
p434
aVVery, very mild \u2014
p435
aa(lp436
VJF: Right.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Applause)
p439
aa(lp440
VAnd gender equality, it's like a tide,
p441
aVit would lift all boats, not just women.
p442
aa(lp443
VPM: Needing new role models on how to do that.
p444
aVHow to be friends,
p445
aVhow to think about our power in different ways,
p446
aVas consumers,
p447
aVas citizens of the world,
p448
aVand this is what makes Jane and Lily
p449
aVa role model of how women can be friends \u2014
p450
aVfor a very long time,
p451
aVand even if they occasionally disagree.
p452
aa(lp453
VThank you.
p454
aVThank you both.
p455
aa(lp456
