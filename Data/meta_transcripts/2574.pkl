VThere are things we say
p4
aVwhen we catch the eye of a stranger
p5
aVor a neighbor walking by.
p6
aVWe say, "Hello, how are you?
p7
aVIt's a beautiful day.
p8
aVHow do you feel?"
p9
aVThese sound kind of meaningless, right? And, in some ways, they are.
p10
aVThey have no semantic meaning.
p11
aVIt doesn't matter how you are or what the day is like.
p12
aVThey have something else.
p13
aVThey have social meaning.
p14
aVWhat we mean when we say those things is:
p15
aVI see you there.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm obsessed with talking to strangers.
p18
aVI make eye contact, say hello,
p19
aVI offer help, I listen.
p20
aVI get all kinds of stories.
p21
aVAbout seven years ago, I started documenting my experiences
p22
aVto try to figure out why.
p23
aVWhat I found was that something really beautiful was going on.
p24
aVThis is almost poetic.
p25
aVThese were really profound experiences.
p26
aVThey were unexpected pleasures.
p27
aVThey were genuine emotional connections.
p28
aVThey were liberating moments.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo one day, I was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change,
p31
aVwhich, I'm a New Yorker,
p32
aVso that means I was actually standing in the street on the storm drain,
p33
aVas if that could get me across faster.
p34
aVAnd there's an old man standing next to me.
p35
aVSo he's wearing, like, a long overcoat and sort of an old-man hat,
p36
aVand he looked like somebody from a movie.
p37
aVAnd he says to me,
p38
aV"Don't stand there. You might disappear."
p39
aVSo this is absurd, right?
p40
aVBut I did what he said. I stepped back onto the sidewalk.
p41
aVAnd he smiled, and he said,
p42
aV"Good. You never know.
p43
aVI might have turned around,
p44
aVand zoop, you're gone."
p45
aa(lp46
VThis was weird,
p47
aVand also really wonderful.
p48
aVHe was so warm, and he was so happy that he'd saved me.
p49
aVWe had this little bond.
p50
aVFor a minute, I felt like my existence as a person
p51
aVhad been noticed,
p52
aVand I was worth saving.
p53
aVThe really sad thing is,
p54
aVin many parts of the world,
p55
aVwe're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default,
p56
aVthat we can't trust them, that they might hurt us.
p57
aVBut most strangers aren't dangerous.
p58
aVWe're uneasy around them because we have no context.
p59
aVWe don't know what their intentions are.
p60
aVSo instead of using our perceptions and making choices,
p61
aVwe rely on this category of "stranger."
p62
aa(lp63
VI have a four-year-old.
p64
aVWhen I say hello to people on the street,
p65
aVshe asks me why.
p66
aVShe says, "Do we know them?"
p67
aa(lp68
VI say, "No, they're our neighbor."
p69
aa(lp70
V"Are they our friend?"
p71
aa(lp72
V"No, it's just good to be friendly."
p73
aa(lp74
VI think twice every time I say that to her,
p75
aVbecause I mean it, but as a woman, particularly,
p76
aVI know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions.
p77
aVIt is good to be friendly, and it's good to learn when not to be,
p78
aVbut none of that means we have to be afraid.
p79
aa(lp80
VThere are two huge benefits
p81
aVto using our senses instead of our fears.
p82
aVThe first one is that it liberates us.
p83
aVWhen you think about it,
p84
aVusing perception instead of categories
p85
aVis much easier said than done.
p86
aVCategories are something our brains use.
p87
aVWhen it comes to people,
p88
aVit's sort of a shortcut for learning about them.
p89
aVWe see male, female, young, old,
p90
aVblack, brown, white, stranger, friend,
p91
aVand we use the information in that box.
p92
aVIt's quick, it's easy
p93
aVand it's a road to bias.
p94
aVAnd it means we're not thinking about people as individuals.
p95
aVI know an American researcher who travels frequently
p96
aVin Central Asia and Africa, alone.
p97
aVShe's entering into towns and cities
p98
aVas a complete stranger.
p99
aVShe has no bonds, no connections.
p100
aVShe's a foreigner.
p101
aVHer survival strategy is this:
p102
aVget one stranger to see you as a real, individual person.
p103
aVIf you can do that, it'll help other people see you that way, too.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy.
p106
aVI know it sounds a little counterintuitive,
p107
aVintimacy and strangers,
p108
aVbut these quick interactions can lead to a feeling
p109
aVthat sociologists call "fleeting intimacy."
p110
aVSo, it's a brief experience that has emotional resonance and meaning.
p111
aVIt's the good feeling I got
p112
aVfrom being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man,
p113
aVor how I feel like part of a community
p114
aVwhen I talk to somebody on my train on the way to work.
p115
aa(lp116
VSometimes it goes further.
p117
aVResearchers have found that people often feel more comfortable
p118
aVbeing honest and open about their inner selves with strangers
p119
aVthan they do with their friends and their families \u2014
p120
aVthat they often feel more understood by strangers.
p121
aVThis gets reported in the media with great lament.
p122
aV"Strangers communicate better than spouses!"
p123
aVIt's a good headline, right?
p124
aVI think it entirely misses the point.
p125
aVThe important thing about these studies
p126
aVis just how significant these interactions can be;
p127
aVhow this special form of closeness
p128
aVgives us something we need as much as we need our friends
p129
aVand our families.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers?
p132
aVThere are two reasons.
p133
aVThe first one is that it's a quick interaction.
p134
aVIt has no consequences.
p135
aVIt's easy to be honest with someone you're never going to see again, right?
p136
aVThat makes sense.
p137
aVThe second reason is where it gets more interesting.
p138
aVWe have a bias when it comes to people we're close to.
p139
aVWe expect them to understand us.
p140
aVWe assume they do,
p141
aVand we expect them to read our minds.
p142
aVSo imagine you're at a party,
p143
aVand you can't believe that your friend or your spouse
p144
aVisn't picking up on it that you want to leave early.
p145
aVAnd you're thinking,
p146
aV"I gave you the look."
p147
aa(lp148
VWith a stranger, we have to start from scratch.
p149
aVWe tell the whole story,
p150
aVwe explain who the people are, how we feel about them;
p151
aVwe spell out all the inside jokes.
p152
aVAnd guess what?
p153
aVSometimes they do understand us a little better.
p154
aa(lp155
VOK.
p156
aVSo now that we know that talking to strangers matters,
p157
aVhow does it work?
p158
aVThere are unwritten rules we tend to follow.
p159
aVThe rules are very different depending on what country you're in,
p160
aVwhat culture you're in.
p161
aVIn most parts of the US,
p162
aVthe baseline expectation in public
p163
aVis that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy.
p164
aVThis is known as civil inattention.
p165
aVSo, imagine two people are walking towards each other on the street.
p166
aVThey'll glance at each other from a distance.
p167
aVThat's the civility, the acknowledgment.
p168
aVAnd then as they get closer, they'll look away,
p169
aVto give each other some space.
p170
aa(lp171
VIn other cultures,
p172
aVpeople go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all.
p173
aVPeople from Denmark tell me
p174
aVthat many Danes are so averse to talking to strangers,
p175
aVthat they would rather miss their stop on the bus
p176
aVthan say "excuse me" to someone that they need to get around.
p177
aVInstead, there's this elaborate shuffling of bags
p178
aVand using your body to say that you need to get past,
p179
aVinstead of using two words.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn Egypt, I'm told,
p182
aVit's rude to ignore a stranger,
p183
aVand there's a remarkable culture of hospitality.
p184
aVStrangers might ask each other for a sip of water.
p185
aVOr, if you ask someone for directions,
p186
aVthey're very likely to invite you home for coffee.
p187
aVWe see these unwritten rules most clearly when they're broken,
p188
aVor when you're in a new place
p189
aVand you're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is.
p190
aa(lp191
VSometimes breaking the rules a little bit is where the action is.
p192
aVIn case it's not clear, I really want you to do this. OK?
p193
aVSo here's how it's going to go.
p194
aVFind somebody who is making eye contact.
p195
aVThat's a good signal.
p196
aVThe first thing is a simple smile.
p197
aVIf you're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here, smile.
p198
aVSee what happens.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnother is triangulation.
p201
aVThere's you, there's a stranger,
p202
aVthere's some third thing that you both might see and comment on,
p203
aVlike a piece of public art
p204
aVor somebody preaching in the street
p205
aVor somebody wearing funny clothes.
p206
aVGive it a try.
p207
aVMake a comment about that third thing, and see if starts a conversation.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnother is what I call noticing.
p210
aVThis is usually giving a compliment.
p211
aVI'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.
p212
aVI'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now,
p213
aVbut shoes are fabulous in general.
p214
aVAnd they're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes.
p215
aVPeople always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes.
p216
aa(lp217
VYou may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle.
p218
aVIt can be awkward to talk to someone on the street;
p219
aVyou don't know how they're going to respond.
p220
aVBut you can always talk to their dog or their baby.
p221
aVThe dog or the baby
p222
aVis a social conduit to the person,
p223
aVand you can tell by how they respond
p224
aVwhether they're open to talking more.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe last one I want to challenge you to
p227
aVis disclosure.
p228
aVThis is a very vulnerable thing to do,
p229
aVand it can be very rewarding.
p230
aVSo next time you're talking to a stranger
p231
aVand you feel comfortable,
p232
aVtell them something true about yourself,
p233
aVsomething really personal.
p234
aVYou might have that experience I talked about of feeling understood.
p235
aa(lp236
VSometimes in conversation, it comes up,
p237
aVpeople ask me, "What does your dad do?" or, "Where does he live?"
p238
aVAnd sometimes I tell them the whole truth,
p239
aVwhich is that he died when I was a kid.
p240
aVAlways in those moments,
p241
aVthey share their own experiences of loss.
p242
aVWe tend to meet disclosure with disclosure,
p243
aVeven with strangers.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, here it is.
p246
aVWhen you talk to strangers, you're making beautiful interruptions
p247
aVinto the expected narrative of your daily life
p248
aVand theirs.
p249
aVYou're making unexpected connections.
p250
aVIf you don't talk to strangers, you're missing out on all of that.
p251
aVWe spend a lot of time
p252
aVteaching our children about strangers.
p253
aVWhat would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves?
p254
aVWe could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other.
p255
aVWe could make a space for change.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.
