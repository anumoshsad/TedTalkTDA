VI started my journey 30 years ago.
p4
aVAnd I worked in mines. And I realized that
p5
aVthis was a world unseen.
p6
aVAnd I wanted, through color and large format cameras
p7
aVand very large prints,
p8
aVto make a body of work that somehow
p9
aVbecame symbols of our
p10
aVuse of the landscape,
p11
aVhow we use the land.
p12
aVAnd to me this was
p13
aVa key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,
p14
aVwhich allows us to contemplate these landscapes,
p15
aVthat I thought photography was perfectly suited
p16
aVto doing this type of work.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,
p19
aVit occurred to me that
p20
aVoil is underpinning the scale and speed.
p21
aVBecause that is what has changed,
p22
aVis the speed at which we're taking all our resources.
p23
aVAnd so then I went out to develop a whole series
p24
aVon the landscape of oil.
p25
aVAnd what I want to do is to kind of map an arc
p26
aVthat there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,
p27
aVrefinement. And that's one chapter.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe other chapter that I wanted to look at was
p30
aVhow we use it \u2014 our cities,
p31
aVour cars, our motorcultures,
p32
aVwhere people gather around the vehicle
p33
aVas a celebration.
p34
aVAnd then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,
p35
aVthis entropic end,
p36
aVwhere all of our parts of cars, our tires,
p37
aVoil filters,
p38
aVhelicopters, planes \u2014
p39
aVwhere are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd to me, again, photography was
p42
aVa way in which I could explore and research the world,
p43
aVand find those places.
p44
aVAnd another idea that I had as well,
p45
aVthat was brought forward by an ecologist \u2014
p46
aVhe basically did a calculation where
p47
aVhe took one liter of gas and said,
p48
aVwell, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?
p49
aVIt was 23 metric tons for one liter.
p50
aVSo whenever I fill up my gas,
p51
aVI think of that liter, and how much carbon.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,
p54
aVbut he did the calculations for our Earth
p55
aVand what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.
p56
aVFrom the photosynthetic growth,
p57
aVit would take 500 years of that growth
p58
aVto produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd that also brought me to the fact that
p61
aVthis poses such a risk to our society.
p62
aVLooking at 30 billion per year,
p63
aVwe look at our two largest suppliers,
p64
aVSaudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.
p65
aVAnd together they only form about 15 years of supply.
p66
aVThe whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,
p67
aVonly gives us about 45 years.
p68
aVSo, it's not a question of if, but a question of when
p69
aVpeak oil will come upon us.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, to me, using photography \u2014
p72
aVand I feel that all of us need to now begin to really
p73
aVtake the task of using our talents,
p74
aVour ways of thinking,
p75
aVto begin to deal with what I think is probably
p76
aVone of the most challenging issues of our time,
p77
aVhow to deal with our energy crisis.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I would like to say that, on the other side of it,
p80
aV30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,
p81
aVI can look at them and say, "We did everything
p82
aVwe possibly, humanly could do,
p83
aVto begin to mitigate this,
p84
aVwhat I feel is one of the most important and critical
p85
aVmoments in our time. Thank you.
