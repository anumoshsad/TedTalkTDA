VBrain magic. What's brain magic all about?
p4
aVBrain magic to me indicates that area of magic
p5
aVdealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.
p6
aVSo unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words,
p7
aVlinguistic deception, non-verbal communication
p8
aVand various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm going to show you all how easy it is
p11
aVto manipulate the human mind once you know how.
p12
aVI want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody.
p13
aVI want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all.
p14
aVOK, clap them together, once.
p15
aVOK, reverse your hands.
p16
aVNow, follow my actions exactly.
p17
aVNow about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that?
p18
aVOK, swap them around, put your right hand up.
p19
aVCross your hands over, so your right hand goes over,
p20
aVinterlace your fingers like this,
p21
aVthen make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb \u2014
p22
aVthat's very important.
p23
aVYours is the other way around, so swap it around.
p24
aVExcellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me.
p25
aVAll right. Tap them together once.
p26
aVOK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds,
p27
aVyou would all be able to do this.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter ends)
p32
aa(lp33
VNow you can see how easy it is
p34
aVfor me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, I remember when I was about 15,
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VI read a copy of Life magazine,
p43
aVwhich detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman
p44
aVwho could sense printed letters \u2014
p45
aVthere's still people trying to do it \u2014
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
V\u2014 who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch.
p50
aVAnd she was completely blind.
p51
aVShe could also read the serial numbers on bills
p52
aVwhen they were placed, face down, on a hard surface.
p53
aVNow, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical.
p54
aVHow could somebody read using their fingertips?
p55
aVYou know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind \u2014
p56
aVa guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms,
p57
aVwhere people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things.
p58
aVAnd it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out.
p59
aVHow could somebody read using their fingertips?
p60
aa(lp61
VNow earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV,
p62
aVI attempted to give a similar demonstration
p63
aVof what is now known as second sight.
p64
aVSo, let's take a look.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Video) Man: There we go.
p67
aVI'm going to guide you into the car.
p68
aa(lp69
VKathryn Thomas: (Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VMan: You're OK, keep on going.
p72
aa(lp73
VKT: How are you?
p74
aa(lp75
VKeith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.
p76
aVI'm going to take you to a secret location, OK?
p77
aVKathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.
p78
aa(lp79
VKT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?
p80
aa(lp81
VKT: Yes.
p82
aa(lp83
VKB: No way to see through it? KT: No.
p84
aa(lp85
VKB: I'll take it off.
p86
aVDo you want to take the rest off?
p87
aVTake it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.
p88
aa(lp89
VKT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see.
p90
aa(lp91
VKB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe.
p92
aVHave you ever heard of second sight?
p93
aa(lp94
VKT: No.
p95
aa(lp96
VKB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert
p97
aVcan see through somebody else's eyes.
p98
aVAnd I'm going to try that right now.
p99
aa(lp100
VKT: God.
p101
aa(lp102
VKB: Are you ready?
p103
aVWhere is it? There's no way \u2014
p104
aa(lp105
VKT: (Beep)
p106
aa(lp107
VKT: Oh, my God!
p108
aa(lp109
VKB: Don't say anything,
p110
aVI'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see.
p111
aa(lp112
VKT: There's a wall, there's a wall.
p113
aa(lp114
VKB: Look at the road, look at the road.
p115
aa(lp116
VKT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!
p117
aa(lp118
VKB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No.
p119
aa(lp120
VKB: Sure there's not?
p121
aa(lp122
VKT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road.
p123
aVI'm looking at the road, all the time.
p124
aVI'm not taking my eyes off the road.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Beep)
p127
aa(lp128
V(Beep)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Beep)
p131
aa(lp132
VKT: Oh, my God!
p133
aa(lp134
VKB: Where are we? Where are we?
p135
aVWe're going uphill, are we going uphill?
p136
aa(lp137
VKT: Look at the road \u2014 (Beep)
p138
aVStill got that goddamn blindfold on.
p139
aa(lp140
VKB: What?
p141
aa(lp142
VKT: How are you doing this?
p143
aa(lp144
VKB: Just don't break my concentration.
p145
aa(lp146
VWe're OK, though? KT: Yes.
p147
aVThat's so weird.
p148
aVWe're nearly there. Oh, my God!
p149
aa(lp150
VOh, my God!
p151
aa(lp152
VKB: And I've stopped.
p153
aa(lp154
VKT: That is weird.
p155
aVYou're like a freak-ass of nature.
p156
aVThat was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VKB: Thank you.
p161
aVBy the way, two days ago, we were going to film this
p162
aVdown there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car,
p163
aVand we got a camera man in the back,
p164
aVbut halfway through the drive,
p165
aVhe told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter,
p166
aVstuck to his leg.
p167
aVSo, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes?
p170
aVThat's the question.
p171
aVNow, most people here would automatically say no.
p172
aVOK, but I want you to realize some facts.
p173
aVI couldn't see through the blindfold.
p174
aVThe car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way.
p175
aVThe girl, I'd never met before, all right.
p176
aVSo, I want you to just think about it for a moment.
p177
aVA lot of people try to come up
p178
aVwith a logical solution to what just happened, all right.
p179
aVBut because your brains are not trained in the art of deception,
p180
aVthe solutions you come up with
p181
aVwill, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is because magic is all about directing attention.
p184
aVIf, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand,
p185
aVthen I don't look at it.
p186
aVBut if I wanted you to look at my right hand,
p187
aVthen I look at it, too.
p188
aVYou see, it's very simple, once you know how,
p189
aVbut very complicated in other ways.
p190
aa(lp191
VI'm going to give you some demonstrations right now.
p192
aVI need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up?
p193
aVAnd let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick?
p194
aVDo you mind? Yes, at the end.
p195
aVOK, give them a round of applause as they come up.
p196
aVYou might want to use the stairs, there.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VIt's very important for everybody here to realize
p201
aVI haven't set anything up with you.
p202
aVYou don't know what will happen, right?
p203
aVWould you mind just standing over here for a moment?
p204
aa(lp205
VYour name is? Nicole: Nicole.
p206
aa(lp207
VKB: Nicole, and?
p208
aa(lp209
V(Telephone ringing)
p210
aa(lp211
VKB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VIs it a girl? Man: They've already gone.
p216
aa(lp217
VKB: OK, swap over positions.
p218
aVCan you stand over here? This will make it easier.
p219
aVPity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades.
p220
aVOK, a little bit closer.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VOK, a little bit closer, come over \u2014 they look really nervous up here.
p225
aVDo you believe in witchcraft?
p226
aa(lp227
VNicole: No.
p228
aa(lp229
VKB: Voodoo? Nicole: No.
p230
aa(lp231
VKB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No.
p232
aa(lp233
VKB: Besides, who's next, no, OK.
p234
aVI want you to just stand exactly like this for me,
p235
aVpull up your sleeves, if you don't mind.
p236
aVOK, now, I want you to be aware
p237
aVof all the different sensations around you,
p238
aVbecause we'll try a voodoo experiment.
p239
aVI want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you,
p240
aVand don't open your eyes until I ask you.
p241
aVFrom this point onwards, close your eyes,
p242
aVdo not say anything, do not open them,
p243
aVbe aware of the sensations.
p244
aa(lp245
VYes or no, did you feel anything?
p246
aa(lp247
VNicole: Yes.
p248
aa(lp249
VKB: You did feel that? What did you feel?
p250
aa(lp251
VNicole: A touch on my back.
p252
aa(lp253
VKB: How many times did you feel it?
p254
aa(lp255
VNicole: Twice.
p256
aa(lp257
VKB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you.
p258
aVExtend your left arm, OK.
p259
aVOK, keep it there.
p260
aVBe aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK.
p261
aa(lp262
VDid you feel anything, there?
p263
aa(lp264
VNicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel?
p265
aa(lp266
VNicole: Three \u2014
p267
aa(lp268
VKB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes.
p269
aa(lp270
VKB: Can you show us where?
p271
aVOK, excellent. Open your eyes.
p272
aVI never touched you.
p273
aVI just touched his back, and I just touched his arm.
p274
aVA voodoo experiment.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VYeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VYou just take a seat over here for a second.
p283
aVI'm going to use you again, in a moment.
p284
aVCan you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind.
p285
aa(lp286
VSit right here. Man: OK.
p287
aa(lp288
VKB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.
p289
aVNow, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK,
p290
aVjust take a deep breath in through your nose,
p291
aVletting it out through your mouth, and relax.
p292
aVAllow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one.
p293
aVClose your eyes right now.
p294
aVOK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,
p295
aVI'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity,
p296
aVso our minds are along the same lines.
p297
aVAnd as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind,
p298
aVI'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
p299
aa(lp300
VI want you to hold it there just for a moment,
p301
aVand I only want you to allow your hand
p302
aVto sink and drift and float back to the tabletop
p303
aVat the same rate and speed
p304
aVas you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness,
p305
aVand allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop.
p306
aVThat's it, all the way down, all the way down.
p307
aVand further, and further.
p308
aVExcellent.
p309
aVI want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
p310
aVOK, now, allow it to stay there.
p311
aa(lp312
VOK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,
p313
aVand I want you to be aware of the pressure.
p314
aVJust be aware of the pressure.
p315
aVAnd I only want you to allow your hand
p316
aVto float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release,
p317
aVbut only when you feel the pressure release.
p318
aVDo you understand? Just answer yes or no.
p319
aa(lp320
VMan: Yes.
p321
aa(lp322
VKB: Hold it right there.
p323
aVAnd only when you feel the pressure go back,
p324
aVallow your hand to drift back to the tabletop,
p325
aVbut only when you feel the pressure.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VOK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.
p330
aa(lp331
VExcellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting.
p332
aVAllow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.
p333
aVCan you stand up? Just stand, stage forward.
p334
aVI want you to point directly at his forehead.
p335
aVOK.
p336
aVImagine a connection between you and him.
p337
aVOnly when you want the pressure to be released,
p338
aVmake an upward gesture, like this,
p339
aVbut only when you want it to be released.
p340
aVYou can wait as long as you want,
p341
aVbut only when you want the pressure released.
p342
aVOK, let's try it again.
p343
aVOK, now, imagine the connection, OK.
p344
aVPoint directly at his forehead.
p345
aVOnly when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.
p346
aa(lp347
VOK, it worked that time, excellent.
p348
aVAnd hold it there, both of you.
p349
aVOnly when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture.
p350
aVYou can wait as long as you want.
p351
aVYou did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow, I want you to be aware that in a moment,
p354
aVwhen I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again.
p355
aVIt's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened.
p356
aVMost people ask you, "What the hell just happened up here?"
p357
aVBut it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized,
p358
aVyou will forget everything that happened.
p359
aVOn five, four, three, two, one \u2014 open your eyes, wide awake.
p360
aVGive them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
VOK, you can go back.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
VI once saw a film called "The Gods Are Crazy."
p369
aVHas anybody here seen that film? Yeah.
p370
aVRemember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane,
p371
aVand it landed on the ground, and it didn't break?
p372
aVNow, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid.
p373
aVIt's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle.
p374
aVDo you want to try it?
p375
aVGood job. She's not taking any chances.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VYou see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence
p380
aVof the mind on physical events and processes.
p381
aVFor some magicians or mentalists,
p382
aVsometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not.
p383
aVSometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not.
p384
aVIt depends on how much energy you have that day,
p385
aVso on and so forth.
p386
aa(lp387
VWe're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now.
p388
aVCome right over here, next to me. Excellent.
p389
aVNow, have a look at the Coke bottle.
p390
aVMake sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
p391
aVAnd you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.
p392
aVEven though it's solid, I'm standing away.
p393
aVI want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb.
p394
aVExcellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.
p395
aVI want you to examine the shard of glass.
p396
aVCareful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment.
p397
aVNow, hold it out here.
p398
aa(lp399
VI want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago.
p400
aVI want you to imagine all the negative energy
p401
aVfrom that broken relationship, from that guy,
p402
aVbeing imparted into the broken piece of glass,
p403
aVwhich will represent him, OK.
p404
aVBut I want you to take this very seriously.
p405
aVStare at the glass, ignore everybody right here.
p406
aVIn a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK,
p407
aVand when you feel that sensation,
p408
aVI want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle.
p409
aVThink of that guy, that ba \u2014 that guy.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VI'm trying to be good here.
p414
aVOK, and when you feel the sensation \u2014
p415
aVit might take a while \u2014 drop it into the glass.
p416
aVOK, drop it in.
p417
aa(lp418
VNow, imagine all that negative energy in there.
p419
aVImagine his name and imagine him inside the glass.
p420
aVAnd I want you to release that negative energy
p421
aVby shaking it from side to side.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Burst)
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VThat was a lot of negative energy, built up in there.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
V(Applause)
p432
aa(lp433
VI also want you to look at me and think of his name.
p434
aVOK, think of how many letters in the title of his name.
p435
aVThere's five letters in the title.
p436
aVYou didn't react to that, so it's four letters.
p437
aVThink of one of the letters in the title.
p438
aVThere's a K in his name, there is a K.
p439
aVI knew that because my name starts with a K also,
p440
aVbut his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M.
p441
aVTell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.
p442
aa(lp443
VWas that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm.
p444
aa(lp445
VKB: OK, give her a round of applause.
p446
aa(lp447
V(Applause)
p448
aa(lp449
VThank you.
p450
aa(lp451
V(Applause)
p452
aa(lp453
V(Applause ends)
p454
aa(lp455
VI've got one more thing to share with you right now.
p456
aVActually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this,
p457
aVbut instead of picking you, can you hop up here
p458
aVand pick a victim for this next experiment?
p459
aVAnd it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.
p460
aa(lp461
VChris Anderson: Oh, OK.
p462
aa(lp463
VKB: I was going to use you,
p464
aVbut I decided I might want to come back another year.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VCA: Well, to reward him for saying "eureka,"
p469
aVand for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us \u2014 Steve Jurvetson.
p470
aa(lp471
VKB: OK, Steve, come on up here.
p472
aa(lp473
V(Applause)
p474
aa(lp475
VCA: You knew!
p476
aa(lp477
VKB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent.
p478
aVNow, Steve \u2014 oh, you can check underneath.
p479
aVGo ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there.
p480
aVThey insist that because I was a magician,
p481
aVput a nice, black tablecloth on.
p482
aVThere you are, OK.
p483
aa(lp484
V(Laughter)
p485
aa(lp486
VI've got four wooden plinths here, Steve.
p487
aVOne, two, three and four.
p488
aVNow, they're all the exact same except this one
p489
aVobviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it.
p490
aVI want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid.
p491
aVHappy?
p492
aa(lp493
VSteve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.
p494
aa(lp495
VKB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table,
p496
aVWhen I stand in front of the table,
p497
aVI want you to put the cups on the plinths,
p498
aVin any order you want, and then mix them all up,
p499
aVso nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right?
p500
aa(lp501
VSJ: No one in the audience?
p502
aa(lp503
VKB: Yes, and just to help you out,
p504
aVI'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing.
p505
aVI'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now.
p506
aVOK, and tell me when you're done.
p507

p511
aa(lp512
VKB: You done? SJ: Almost.
p513
aa(lp514
VKB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden.
p515
aVOh, we've got one here, we've got one here.
p516
aa(lp517
V(Applause)
p518
aa(lp519
VSo, all right, we'll leave them like that.
p520
aa(lp521
V(Laughter)
p522
aa(lp523
VI'm going to have the last laugh, though.
p524
aa(lp525
V(Laughter)
p526
aa(lp527
VNow, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct?
p528
aVBut I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair.
p529
aVThey'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny.
p530
aVNo, stay around, OK.
p531
aVNow, Steve, look back.
p532
aVNow you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either.
p533
aVNow, is there any way to see through this blindfold?
p534
aa(lp535
VSJ: Put this on?
p536
aa(lp537
VKB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No?
p538
aa(lp539
VSJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent.
p540
aVNow, I'm going to put on the blindfold.
p541
aVDon't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up.
p542
aVDon't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is,
p543
aVbut give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up.
p544
aVI'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up.
p545
aVNo messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up.
p546
aVMy hand is at risk here.
p547
aa(lp548
V(Laughter)
p549
aa(lp550
VTell me when you're done. SJ: Done.
p551
aa(lp552
VKB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand.
p553
aVTell me when I'm over a cup.
p554
aa(lp555
VSJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now?
p556
aa(lp557
VSJ: Mm-hmm.
p558
aa(lp559
VKB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no?
p560
aa(lp561
VSJ: Oh!
p562
aa(lp563
V(Laughter)
p564
aa(lp565
VKB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.
p566
aa(lp567
V(Laughter)
p568
aa(lp569
VSJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision.
p570

p572
aa(lp573
V(Applause)
p574
aa(lp575
V(Applause ends)
p576
aa(lp577
VNow, if I go this way, is there another cup over here?
p578
aa(lp579
VSJ: Can we do the left hand?
p580
aa(lp581
VKB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not.
p582
aa(lp583
V(Laughter)
p584
aa(lp585
VKB: If I go this way, is there another cup?
p586
aa(lp587
VSJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop.
p588
aa(lp589
VSJ: OK. KB: There?
p590
aa(lp591
VSJ: Yes, there's one.
p592
aa(lp593
VKB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine.
p594
aa(lp595
V(Laughter)
p596
aa(lp597
VSJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision.
p598
aa(lp599
V(Laughter)
p600
aa(lp601
VOK, give me both hands.
p602
aVNow, put them on both cups.
p603
aVDo you think the spike is under your left or your right hand?
p604
aa(lp605
VSJ: Neither.
p606
aa(lp607
VKB: Neither, oh, OK.
p608
aVBut if you were to guess.
p609
aa(lp610
V(Laughter)
p611
aa(lp612
VSJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand?
p613
aVNow, remember, you made all the decisions all along.
p614
aVPsychologists, figure this out.

p628
aVI'll be outside.
p629
aVThank you.
