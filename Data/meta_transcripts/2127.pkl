VYou know, it's a big privilege for me
p4
aVto be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world:
p5
aVthe Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.
p6
aVThese islands \u2014 Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Réunion \u2014
p7
aValong with the island of Madagascar,
p8
aVthey are blessed with unique plants
p9
aVfound nowhere else in the world.
p10
aVAnd today I will tell you  about five of them
p11
aVand their particular features
p12
aVand why these plants are so unique.
p13
aa(lp14
VTake a look at this plant.
p15
aVI call it benjoin in the local vernacular,
p16
aVand the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe,
p17
aVsubspecies bentzoe.
p18
aVThis subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,
p19
aVand its particular feature
p20
aVis its heterophylly.
p21
aVWhat do I mean by heterophylly?
p22
aVIt's that the same plant
p23
aVhas got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.
p24
aVNow, these plants have evolved
p25
aVvery far away from the mainland,
p26
aVand within specific ecosystems.
p27
aVOften, these particular features
p28
aVhave evolved as a response to the threat
p29
aVpresented by the local fauna,
p30
aVin this case, grazing tortoises.
p31
aVTortoises are known to have poor eyesight,
p32
aVand as such, they tend to avoid the plants
p33
aVthey don't recognize.
p34
aVSo this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant
p35
aVagainst these rather cute animals,
p36
aVand protects it and of course  ensures its survival.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow the question you're  probably asking yourself is,
p39
aVwhy is she telling us all these stories?
p40
aVThe reason for that is that we tend to overlook
p41
aVthe diversity and the variety of the natural world.
p42
aVThese particular habitats are unique
p43
aVand they are host to a whole lot of plants.
p44
aVWe don't realize how valuable
p45
aVand how precious these resources are,
p46
aVand yet, through our insouciance,
p47
aVwe keep on destroying them.
p48
aVWe're all familiar
p49
aVwith the macro impact of urbanization,
p50
aVclimate change, resource exploitation,
p51
aVbut when that one last plant \u2014
p52
aVor animal for that matter \u2014
p53
aVwhen that very last specimen
p54
aVhas disappeared from the face of this Earth,
p55
aVwe would have lost
p56
aVan entire subset of the Earth's biology,
p57
aVand with it, important plants  with medicinal potential
p58
aVor which could have ingredients
p59
aVthat would speak to the cosmetic,
p60
aVnutrition, pharma,
p61
aVand even the ethno-veterinary sectors,
p62
aVbe gone forever.
p63
aVAnd here we have a very prime example
p64
aVof the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,
p65
aVand, of course, we know is  now a symbol of extinction.
p66
aa(lp67
VWe know plants have a  fundamental role to play.
p68
aVWell, first of all, they feed us
p69
aVand they also give us  the oxygen we breathe,
p70
aVbut plants are also the source
p71
aVof important, biologically active ingredients
p72
aVthat we should be studying very carefully,
p73
aVbecause human societies over the millennia,
p74
aVthey have developed important knowledge,
p75
aVcultural traditions,
p76
aVand important plant-based medicinal resources.
p77
aVHere's a data point:
p78
aV1.4 percent of the entire land surface
p79
aVis home to 40 percent of the species of higher plants,
p80
aV35 percent of the species of vertebrates,
p81
aVand this 1.4 percent
p82
aVrepresents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,
p83
aVand this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface
p84
aValready provides for 35 percent
p85
aVof the ecosystem services
p86
aVthat vulnerable people depend on.
p87
aVAnd as you can see,
p88
aVthe island of Mauritius
p89
aVwhere I work and where I live,
p90
aVbelongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,
p91
aVand I study the unique plants
p92
aVon the island for their  biomedical applications.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, let's go back again
p95
aVto that first plant I showed you,
p96
aVthe one, of course, with  different-shaped leaves
p97
aVand different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,
p98
aVsubspecies bentzoe,
p99
aVa plant only found in Mauritius.
p100
aVNow, the local people,
p101
aVthey used a decoction of the leaves
p102
aVagainst infectious diseases.
p103
aVNow our work, that is,
p104
aVthe scientific validation of  this traditional information,
p105
aVhas shown that precisely
p106
aVthat leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,
p107
aVagainst a wide range of bacteria
p108
aVthat could be pathogenic to humans.
p109
aVNow, could this plant be the answer
p110
aVto antibiotic resistance?
p111
aVYou know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be
p112
aVa big challenge globally.
p113
aVWhile we may not be sure, one thing is certain:
p114
aVwe will not want this plant to disappear.
p115
aVBut the harsh reality is that
p116
aVthis particular plant is in fact
p117
aVconsidered to be vulnerable
p118
aVin its natural habitat.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis brings me to another example.
p121
aVThis bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate
p122
aVin the local vernacular.
p123
aVThe botanical name is Psiadia arguta.
p124
aVIt's a plant which is rare,
p125
aVwhich is endemic to Mauritius.
p126
aVIt used to grow on the mainland,
p127
aVbut through the sheer  pressures of urbanization
p128
aVhas been pushed out of the mainland,
p129
aVand we've managed to bring it back
p130
aVfrom the brink of extinction
p131
aVby developing in vitro plants
p132
aVwhich are now growing in the wild.
p133
aVNow, one thing I must  point out straightaway
p134
aVis that not all plants
p135
aVcan be developed in vitro.
p136
aVWhile we humans, we are  happy in our comfort zone,
p137
aVthese plants also need
p138
aVtheir ecosystem to be preserved,
p139
aVand they don't react \u2014 endemic plants
p140
aVdon't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem,
p141
aVand yet we know what are the challenges
p142
aVthat climate change, for example,
p143
aVis posing to these plants.
p144
aVNow, the local people again use the leaves
p145
aVin traditional medicine
p146
aVagainst respiratory problems.
p147
aVNow, our preliminary labwork
p148
aVon the leaf extract has shown
p149
aVthat precisely these  leaves contain ingredients
p150
aVthat are very close,  in terms of structures,
p151
aVchemical structures, to those medicines
p152
aVwhich are sold in the chemist's shop
p153
aVagainst asthma.
p154
aVSo who knows
p155
aVwhat humanity will benefit from
p156
aVshould this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, I come from the developing world
p159
aVwhere we are forever being  challenged with this issue
p160
aVof population explosion.
p161
aVAfrica is the continent  which is getting younger,
p162
aVand whenever one talks  about population explosion,
p163
aVone talks about the issue of food security
p164
aVas being the other side of the same coin.
p165
aVNow this plant here, the baobab,
p166
aVcould be part of the answer.
p167
aVIt's an underutilized, neglected food plant.
p168
aVIt defines the landscape of West Africa,
p169
aVwhere it is known as the tree of life,
p170
aVand later on I will tell you why
p171
aVthe Africans consider it to be the tree of life.
p172
aVNow interestingly, there are many legends
p173
aVwhich are associated with this plant.
p174
aVBecause of its sheer size,
p175
aVit was meant to be lording over lesser plants,
p176
aVso God didn't like this arrogance,
p177
aVuprooted it, and planted it upside down,
p178
aVhence its particular shape.
p179
aVAnd if you look at this tree again
p180
aVwithin the African context,
p181
aVin West Africa, it's known  as the palaver tree,
p182
aVbecause it performs great social functions.
p183
aVNow if you have a problem in the community,
p184
aVmeeting under the palaver tree
p185
aVwith the chiefs or the tribesmen
p186
aVwould be synonymous to trying to find a solution
p187
aVto that particular problem,
p188
aVand also to reinforce trust and respect
p189
aVamong members of the community.
p190
aVFrom the scientific point of view,
p191
aVthere are eight species of baobab in the world.
p192
aVThere's one from Africa,
p193
aVone from Australia,
p194
aVand six are endemic
p195
aVto the island of Madagascar.
p196
aVThe one I have showed you
p197
aVis the one from Africa,
p198
aVAdansonia digitata.
p199
aVNow, the flower, this  beautiful white flower,
p200
aVit opens at night, is pollinated by bats,
p201
aVand it gives rise to the fruit
p202
aVwhich is curiously known
p203
aVas the monkey apple.
p204
aVThe monkeys are not stupid animals.
p205
aVThey know what's good for them.
p206
aVNow, if you open the fruit of the baobab,
p207
aVyou'll see a white, floury pulp,
p208
aVwhich is very rich in nutrients
p209
aVand has got protein,
p210
aVmore protein than in human milk.
p211
aVYes, you heard right:
p212
aVmore protein than in human milk.
p213
aVAnd this is one of the reasons why
p214
aVthe nutrition companies of this world,
p215
aVthey are looking for this fruit to provide
p216
aVwhat we know as reinforced food.
p217
aVThe seeds give an oil, a very stable oil
p218
aVwhich is sought after  by the cosmetic industry
p219
aVto give to produce body lotions, for example.
p220
aVAnd if you look at the trunk,
p221
aVthe trunk, of course, safeguards water,
p222
aVwhich is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,
p223
aVand the leaves are used in traditional medicine
p224
aVagainst infectious disease.
p225
aVNow, you can see now why the Africans consider it
p226
aVto be the tree of life.
p227
aVIt's a complete plant,
p228
aVand in fact, the sheer size of these trees
p229
aVis hiding a massive potential,
p230
aVnot only for the pharma, nutrition, and the cosmetic industry.
p231
aVWhat I have showed you here
p232
aVis only the species from Africa,
p233
aVAdansonia digitata.
p234
aVWe have six species yet in Madagascar,
p235
aVand we don't know what  is the potential of this plant,
p236
aVbut one thing we know is that the flora
p237
aVis considered to be  threatened with extinction.
p238
aa(lp239
VLet me take you to Africa again,
p240
aVand introduce you to one of my very favorite,
p241
aVthe resurrection plant.
p242
aVNow here you'll find
p243
aVthat even Jesus has competition.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVNow, this plant here has developed
p246
aVremarkable tolerance to drought,
p247
aVwhich enables it to withstand
p248
aVup to 98 percent dehydration  over the period of a year
p249
aVwithout damage,
p250
aVand yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely
p251
aVovernight, over 24 hours, and flower.
p252
aVNow, us human beings,
p253
aVwe're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.
p254
aVWe don't want to get old, and rightly so.
p255
aVWhy should we, especially if you can afford it?
p256
aVAnd this gives you an indication
p257
aVof what the plant looks like before.
p258
aVNow, if you are an inexperienced gardener,
p259
aVthe first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden
p260
aVis to uproot this plant because it's dead.
p261
aVBut if you water it, this is what you get.
p262
aVAbsolutely amazing.
p263
aVNow, if you look at our aging process,
p264
aVthe aging process is in fact the loss of water
p265
aVfrom the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling
p266
aVas we know it, especially women,
p267
aVwe are so conscious of this.
p268
aVAnd this plant, in fact, is giving  the cosmetic chemists
p269
aVvery important ingredients
p270
aVthat are actually finding ways
p271
aVto slow down the aging process
p272
aVand at the same time reinforce the cells
p273
aVagainst the onslaught of environmental toxins.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, these four examples
p276
aVI have just given you
p277
aVare just a very tiny reminder
p278
aVas to how our health
p279
aVand our survival are closely linked
p280
aVto the health and the resilience
p281
aVof our ecosystem,
p282
aVand why we should be very careful
p283
aVabout preserving biodiversity.
p284
aVEvery time a forest is cut down,
p285
aVevery time a marsh is filled in,
p286
aVit is a potential lab that goes with it,
p287
aVand which we will never, ever recover.
p288
aVAnd I know what I'm talking about,
p289
aVcoming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.
p290
aa(lp291
VLet me finish with just one last example.
p292
aVConservation issues are normally guided
p293
aVtowards rare, endemic plants,
p294
aVbut what we call exotic plants,
p295
aVthat is, the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world,
p296
aVthey also need to be considered.
p297
aVYou know why? Because the environment plays
p298
aVa very important role
p299
aVin modifying the composition of that plant.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo let's take a look at this plant here,
p302
aVCentella asiatica. It's a weed.
p303
aVWe call it a weed.
p304
aVNow, Centella asiatica  grows across the world
p305
aVin many different habitats \u2014  in Africa, in Asia \u2014
p306
aVand this plant has been instrumental
p307
aVin providing a solution  to that dreadful disease
p308
aVcalled leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.
p309
aVNow, while Centella  grows across the world \u2014
p310
aVin Africa, in Asia \u2014  the best quality Centella
p311
aVcomes from Madagascar,
p312
aVbecause that Centella contains the three vital ingredients
p313
aVwhich are sought after by the pharma
p314
aVand the cosmetic companies.
p315
aVAnd the cosmetic companies  are already using it
p316
aVto make regenerating cream.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, there is an ancient saying
p319
aVthat for every disease known to mankind,
p320
aVthere is a plant to cure it.
p321
aVNow, you may not  believe in ancient sayings.
p322
aVYou may think they're obsolete
p323
aVnow that our science and  technology are so powerful.
p324
aVSo you may look on Centella as being
p325
aVan insignificant, humble weed,
p326
aVwhich, if destroyed, won't be missed.
p327
aVBut you know, there is no such thing as a weed.
p328
aVIt's a plant.
p329
aVIt's a living biological lab
p330
aVthat may well have answers
p331
aVto the question that we may have,
p332
aVbut we have to ensure
p333
aVthat it has the right to live.
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
