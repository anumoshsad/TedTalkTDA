aa(lp8
VSo, sorry \u2014 it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.
p9
aVNo, what I want to do is take you back to 1854
p10
aVin London for the next few minutes, and tell the story \u2014
p11
aVin brief \u2014 of this outbreak,
p12
aVwhich in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,
p13
aVand particularly the kind of city that we live in today.
p14
aVThis period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,
p15
aVin London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.
p16
aVBut I think the most important one is that
p17
aVLondon was this city of 2.5 million people,
p18
aVand it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.
p19
aVBut it was also the largest city that had ever been built.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd so the Victorians were trying to live through
p22
aVand simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:
p23
aVthis scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living."
p24
aVAnd it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.
p25
aVThey were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis
p26
aVwith an Elizabethan public infrastructure.
p27
aVSo people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,
p28
aVhad cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.
p29
aVAnd they would just kind of throw the buckets down there
p30
aVand hope that it would somehow go away,
p31
aVand of course it never really would go away.
p32
aVAnd all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point
p33
aVwhere the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,
p36
aVbut also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.
p37
aVNot just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,
p38
aVthat they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic
p39
aVuntil literally their milk ran out and they died,
p40
aVand then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.
p41
aVSo, you would just walk around London at this point
p42
aVand just be overwhelmed with this stench.
p43
aVAnd what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system
p44
aVbecame convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,
p45
aVthat was creating these diseases
p46
aVthat would wipe through the city every three or four years.
p47
aVAnd cholera was really the great killer of this period.
p48
aa(lp49
VIt arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years
p50
aVanother epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London
p51
aVand throughout the U.K.
p52
aVAnd so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.
p53
aVWe had to get rid of the smell.
p54
aVAnd so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,
p55
aVfounding public-health interventions in the system of the city,
p56
aVone of which was called the "Nuisances Act,"
p57
aVwhich they got everybody as far as they could
p58
aVto empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
p59
aVBecause if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,
p60
aVand \u2014 oh right, we drink from the river.
p61
aVSo what ended up happening, actually,
p62
aVis they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera
p63
aVbecause, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.
p64
aVIt's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.
p65
aVIt's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century
p68
aVeffectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively
p69
aVthan any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.
p70
aVSo this was the state of London in 1854,
p71
aVand in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,
p72
aVand in the midst of all this scientific confusion
p73
aVabout what was actually killing people,
p74
aVit was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,
p75
aVwho was a local doctor in Soho in London,
p76
aVwho had been arguing for about four or five years
p77
aVthat cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,
p78
aVand had basically convinced nobody of this.
p79
aVThe public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.
p80
aVAnd he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,
p81
aVbut nothing had really stuck.
p82
aVAnd part of \u2014 what's so interesting about this story to me
p83
aVis that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,
p84
aVhow a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.
p85
aVAnd Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd then on one day, August 28th of 1854,
p88
aVa young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,
p89
aVwe know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,
p90
aVcame down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.
p91
aVYou can't really see it in this map, but this is the map
p92
aVthat becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.
p93
aVIt's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,
p94
aVthis little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,
p95
aVthat they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,
p96
aVbordered on an extremely popular water pump,
p97
aVlocal watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,
p98
aVthat all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd so this little girl inadvertently ended up
p101
aVcontaminating the water in this popular pump,
p102
aVand one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England
p103
aVerupted about two or three days later.
p104
aVLiterally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,
p105
aVand much more would have died if people hadn't fled
p106
aVafter the initial outbreak kicked in.
p107
aVSo it was this incredibly terrifying event.
p108
aVYou had these scenes of entire families dying
p109
aVover the course of 48 hours of cholera,
p110
aValone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.
p111
aVJust an extraordinary, terrifying scene.
p112
aVSnow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,
p113
aVand in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast
p114
aVbecause he thought an outbreak that concentrated
p115
aVcould actually potentially end up convincing people that,
p116
aVin fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.
p117
aVHe suspected an outbreak that concentrated
p118
aVwould probably involve a single point source.
p119
aVOne single thing that everybody was going to
p120
aVbecause it didn't have the traditional slower path
p121
aVof infections that you might expect.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd so he went right in there and started interviewing people.
p124
aVHe eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,
p125
aVwho's kind of the other protagonist of the book \u2014
p126
aVthis guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,
p127
aVwho was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;
p128
aVhe knew everybody in the neighborhood.
p129
aVAnd he managed to track down, Whitehead did,
p130
aVmany of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,
p131
aVor who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
p132
aVAnd eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
p133
aVHe found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
p134
aVPeople who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
p135
aVAnd he thought about representing that
p136
aVas a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,
p137
aVpeople who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,
p138
aVbut eventually he hit upon the idea
p139
aVthat what he needed was something that you could see.
p140
aVSomething that would take in a sense a higher-level view
p141
aVof all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd so he created this map,
p144
aVwhich basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods
p145
aVas black bars at each address.
p146
aVAnd you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it
p147
aVand you can see that one of the residences down the way
p148
aVhad about 15 people dead.
p149
aVAnd the map is actually a little bit bigger.
p150
aVAs you get further and further away from the pump,
p151
aVthe deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.
p152
aVAnd so you can see this something poisonous
p153
aVemanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.
p154
aVAnd so, with the help of this map,
p155
aVand with the help of more evangelizing
p156
aVthat he did over the next few years
p157
aVand that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,
p158
aVthe authorities slowly started to come around.
p159
aVIt took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,
p160
aVbut by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,
p161
aVthe authorities had been convinced \u2014 in part because of this story,
p162
aVin part because of this map \u2014 that in fact the water was the problem.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd they had already started building the sewers in London,
p165
aVand they immediately went to this outbreak
p166
aVand they told everybody to start boiling their water.
p167
aVAnd that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
p168
aVSo, part of this story, I think \u2014 well, it's a terrifying story,
p169
aVit's a very dark story and it's a story
p170
aVthat continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.
p171
aVIt's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,
p172
aVwhich is to say that it's possible to solve these problems
p173
aVif we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,
p174
aVif we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,
p175
aVif we listen to the locals who understand
p176
aVwhat's going on in these kinds of situations.
p177
aVAnd what it ended up doing is making the idea
p178
aVof large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhen people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying
p181
aVin the space of seven days,
p182
aVthere was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,
p183
aVthat people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.
p184
aVBut because of what Snow did, because of this map,
p185
aVbecause of the whole series of reforms
p186
aVthat happened in the wake of this map,
p187
aVwe now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,
p188
aVcities like this one are in fact sustainable things.
p189
aVWe don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself
p190
aVquite the way that, you know, Rome did,
p191
aVand be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.
p192
aVAnd so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.
p193
aVIt's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,
p194
aVthe life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.
