VIn 1987, Tina Lord found herself in quite the pickle.
p4
aVSee, this gold digger made sure she married sweet Cord Roberts
p5
aVjust before he inherited millions.
p6
aVBut when Cord found out Tina loved his money
p7
aVas much as she loved him,
p8
aVhe dumped her.
p9
aVCord's mother Maria was thrilled
p10
aVuntil they hooked up again.
p11
aVSo Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina
p12
aVand then made sure Cord didn't find out Tina was pregnant with his baby.
p13
aVSo Tina, still married but thinking Cord didn't love her
p14
aVflew to Argentina with Max.
p15
aVCord finally figured out what was going on
p16
aVand rushed after them, but he was too late.
p17
aVTina had already been kidnapped,
p18
aVstrapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall.
p19
aVShe and her baby were presumed dead.
p20
aVCord was sad for a bit,
p21
aVbut then he bounced right back
p22
aVwith a supersmart archaeologist named Kate,
p23
aVand they had a gorgeous wedding
p24
aVuntil Tina, seemingly back from the dead, ran into the church holding a baby.
p25
aV"Stop!" she screamed.
p26
aV"Am I too late?
p27
aVCord, I've come so far.
p28
aVThis is your son."
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd that, ladies and gentlemen,
p31
aVis how the soap opera "One Life to Live" introduced a love story
p32
aVthat lasted 25 years.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, if you've ever seen a soap opera,
p37
aVyou know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated, larger than life,
p38
aVand if you're a fan, you find that exaggeration fun,
p39
aVand if you're not,
p40
aVmaybe you find them melodramatic or unsophisticated.
p41
aVMaybe you think watching soap operas
p42
aVis a waste of time,
p43
aVthat their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent.
p44
aVBut I believe the opposite to be true.
p45
aVSoap operas reflect life, just bigger.
p46
aVSo there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas,
p47
aVand those lessons are as big and adventurous
p48
aVas any soap opera storyline.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, I've been a fan since I ran home from the bus stop in second grade
p51
aVdesperate to catch the end of Luke and Laura's wedding,
p52
aVthe biggest moment in "General Hospital" history.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo you can imagine how much I loved my eight years
p57
aVas the assistant casting director on "As the World Turns."
p58
aVMy job was watching soap operas,
p59
aVreading soap opera scripts
p60
aVand auditioning actors to be on soap operas.
p61
aVSo I know my stuff.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd yes, soap operas
p66
aVare larger than life,
p67
aVdrama on a grand scale,
p68
aVbut our lives can be filled with as much intensity,
p69
aVand the stakes can feel just as dramatic.
p70
aVWe cycle through tragedy and joy
p71
aVjust like these characters.
p72
aVWe cross thresholds, fight demons and find salvation unexpectedly,
p73
aVand we do it again and again and again,
p74
aVbut just like soaps, we can flip the script,
p75
aVwhich means we can learn from these characters
p76
aVthat move like bumblebees,
p77
aVlooping and swerving through life.
p78
aVAnd we can use those lessons
p79
aVto craft our own life stories.
p80
aVSoap operas teach us to push away doubt
p81
aVand believe in our capacity
p82
aVfor bravery, vulnerability,
p83
aVadaptability and resilience.
p84
aVAnd most importantly, they show us
p85
aVit's never too late to change your story.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo with that, let's start with soap opera lesson one:
p88
aVsurrender is not an option.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
V"All My Children"'s Erica Kane was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,
p93
aVa hyperbolically self-important princess
p94
aVwho deep down was scrappy and daring.
p95
aVNow, in her 41 years on TV, perhaps Erica's most famous scene
p96
aVis her alone in the woods
p97
aVsuddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.
p98
aVShe screamed at the bear,
p99
aV"You may not do this!
p100
aVDo you understand me?
p101
aVYou may not come near me!
p102
aVI am Erica Kane
p103
aVand you are a filthy beast!"
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd of course the bear left,
p108
aVso what that teaches us
p109
aVis obstacles are to be expected
p110
aVand we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight.
p111
aa(lp112
VPandora's Tim Westergren knows this better than most.
p113
aVYou might even call him the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.
p114
aVTim and his cofounders launched the company
p115
aVwith two million dollars in funding.
p116
aVThey were out of cash the next year.
p117
aVNow, lots of companies fold at that point, but Tim chose to fight.
p118
aVHe maxed out 11 credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt
p119
aVand it still wasn't enough.
p120
aVSo every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees
p121
aVand he asked them to sacrifice their salaries,
p122
aVand it worked.
p123
aVMore than 50 people deferred two million dollars,
p124
aVand now, more than a decade later,
p125
aVPandora is worth billions.
p126
aVWhen you believe that there is a way
p127
aVaround or through whatever is in front of you,
p128
aVthat surrender is not an option,
p129
aVyou can overcome enormous obstacles.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhich brings us to soap opera lesson two:
p132
aVsacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, this is scary.
p135
aVIt's an acknowledgment of need or fallibility.
p136
aVMaybe it's even an admission
p137
aVthat we're not as special as we might like to think.
p138
aVStephanie Forrester of "The Bold and the Beautiful"
p139
aVthought she was pretty darn special.
p140
aVShe thought she was so special,
p141
aVshe didn't need to mix with the riffraff from the valley,
p142
aVand she made sure valley girl Brooke knew it.
p143
aVBut after nearly 25 years of epic fighting,
p144
aVStephanie got sick and let Brooke in.
p145
aVThey made amends,
p146
aVarchenemies became soul mates
p147
aVand Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,
p148
aVand here's our takeaway.
p149
aVDrop your ego.
p150
aVLife is not about you.
p151
aVIt's about us,
p152
aVand our ability to experience joy
p153
aVand love and to improve our reality
p154
aVcomes only when we make ourselves vulnerable
p155
aVand we accept responsibility for our actions
p156
aVand our inactions,
p157
aVkind of like Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, after a great run as CEO,
p160
aVHoward stepped down in 2000,
p161
aVand Starbucks quickly overextended itself
p162
aVand stock prices fell.
p163
aVHoward rejoined the team in 2008,
p164
aVand one of the first things he did
p165
aVwas apologize to all 180,000 employees.
p166
aVHe apologized.
p167
aVAnd then he asked for help, honesty, and ideas in return.
p168
aVAnd now, Starbucks has more than doubled
p169
aVits net revenue since Howard came back.
p170
aVSo sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time.
p171
aVIt's not helping anyone, least of all you.
p172
aVSacrifice your ego.
p173
aa(lp174
VSoap opera lesson three:
p175
aVevolution is real.
p176
aVYou're not meant to be static characters.
p177
aVOn television, static equals boring and boring equals fired.
p178
aVCharacters are supposed to grow and change.
p179
aVNow, on TV, those dynamic changes
p180
aVcan make for some rough transitions,
p181
aVparticularly when a character is played by one person yesterday
p182
aVand played by someone new today.
p183
aVRecasting happens all the time on soaps.
p184
aVOver the last 20 years,
p185
aVfour different actors have played the same key role
p186
aVof Carly Benson on "General Hospital."
p187
aVEach new face triggered a change in the character's life and personality.
p188
aVNow, there was always an essential nugget of Carly in there,
p189
aVbut the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd here's what that means for us.
p192
aVWhile we may not swap faces in our own lives,
p193
aVwe can evolve too.
p194
aVWe can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot,
p195
aVor we can open ourselves to opportunities
p196
aVlike Carly, who went from nursing student to hotel owner,
p197
aVor like Julia Child.
p198
aa(lp199
VJulia was a World War II spy,
p200
aVand when the war ended, she got married, moved to France,
p201
aVand decided to give culinary school a shot.
p202
aVJulia, her books and her TV shows revolutionized the way America cooks.
p203
aa(lp204
VWe all have the power to initiate change in our lives,
p205
aVto evolve and adapt.
p206
aVWe make the choice,
p207
aVbut sometimes life chooses for us, and we don't get a heads up.
p208
aVSurprise slams us in the face.
p209
aVYou're flat on the ground, the air is gone,
p210
aVand you need resuscitation.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo thank goodness for soap opera lesson four:
p213
aVresurrection is possible.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VIn 1983, "Days of Our Lives"' Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,
p220
aVbut not really, because in 1984
p221
aVhe died when his car plunged into the harbor,
p222
aVand yet he was back in 1985 with a brain tumor.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VBut before the tumor could kill him,
p227
aVMarlena shot him, and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death.
p228
aVAnd so it went for 30 years.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VEven when we saw the body,
p233
aVwe knew better.
p234
aVHe's called the Phoenix for a reason.
p235
aVAnd here's what that means for us.
p236
aVAs long as the show is still on the air,
p237
aVor you're still breathing,
p238
aVnothing is permanent.
p239
aVResurrection is possible.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, of course, just like life,
p242
aVsoap operas do ultimately meet the big finale.
p243
aVCBS canceled my show, "As The World Turns," in December 2009,
p244
aVand we shot our final episode
p245
aVin June 2010.
p246
aVIt was six months of dying
p247
aVand I rode that train right into the mountain.
p248
aVAnd even though we were in the middle of a huge recession
p249
aVand millions of people were struggling to find work,
p250
aVI somehow thought everything would be OK.
p251
aVSo I packed up the kids and the Brooklyn apartment,
p252
aVand we moved in with my in-laws
p253
aVin Alabama.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VThree months later, nothing was OK.
p258
aVThat was when I watched the final episode air,
p259
aVand I realized the show was not the only fatality.
p260
aVI was one too.
p261
aVI was unemployed and living on the second floor
p262
aVof my in-laws' home,
p263
aVand that's enough to make anyone feel dead inside.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VBut I knew my story wasn't over,
p268
aVthat it couldn't be over.
p269
aVI just had to tap into everything I had ever learned about soap operas.
p270
aVI had to be brave like Erica and refuse to surrender,
p271
aVso every day, I made a decision to fight.
p272
aVI had to be vulnerable like Stephanie
p273
aVand sacrifice my ego.
p274
aVI had to ask for help a lot of times across many states.
p275
aVI had to be adaptable like Carly
p276
aVand evolve my skills, my mindset, and my circumstances,
p277
aVand then I had to be resilient, like Stefano,
p278
aVand resurrect myself and my career
p279
aVlike a phoenix from the ashes.
p280
aa(lp281
VEventually I got an interview.
p282
aVAfter 15 years in news and entertainment,
p283
aVnine months of unemployment
p284
aVand this one interview,
p285
aVI had an offer for an entry level job.
p286
aVI was 37 years old
p287
aVand I was back from the dead.
p288
aa(lp289
VWe will all experience what looks like an ending,
p290
aVand we can choose to make it a beginning.
p291
aVKind of like Tina, who miraculously survived that waterfall,
p292
aVand because I hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging,
p293
aVTina and Cord did get divorced,
p294
aVbut they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in 2012.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo remember,
p297
aVas long as there is breath in your body,
p298
aVit's never too late to change your story.
p299
aa(lp300
VThank you.
