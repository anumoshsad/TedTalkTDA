VWell, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.
p4
aVIn fact, mostly now in other things.
p5
aa(lp6
VOne thing is distant relationships among human languages.
p7
aVAnd the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.
p8
aVand in Western Europe mostly try to stay away
p9
aVfrom any long-distance relationships, big groupings,
p10
aVgroupings that go back a long time,
p11
aVlonger than the familiar families.
p12
aVThey don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.
p13
aVAnd there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,
p14
aVwho are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,
p15
aVand I would love to see where that leads.
p16
aa(lp17
VDoes it really lead to a single ancestor
p18
aVsome 20, 25,000 years ago?
p19
aVAnd what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,
p20
aVwhen there was presumably a competition among many languages?
p21
aVHow far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?
p22
aVHow many tens of thousands of years does it go back?
p23
aa(lp24
VChris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?
p25
aa(lp26
VMurray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older
p27
aVthan the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures
p28
aVand dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,
p29
aVin the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.
p30
aVI can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.
p31
aVSo, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most
p34
aVof today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps
p35
aVfrom one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,
p36
aVor something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.
p37
aa(lp38
VCA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.
p39
aVYou may just know more about everything than anyone.
p40
aVSo, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.
