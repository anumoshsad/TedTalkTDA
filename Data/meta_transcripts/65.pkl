VI'm really excited to be here today.
p4
aVI'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab,
p5
aVliterally, and I'm really glad that you guys
p6
aVare going to be among the first to see it in person,
p7
aVbecause I really think this is going to really change
p8
aVthe way we interact with machines from this point on.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, this is a rear-projected drafting table.
p11
aVIt's about 36 inches wide
p12
aVand it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor.
p13
aVNormal touch sensors that you see,
p14
aVlike on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards,
p15
aVcan only register one point of contact at a time.
p16
aVThis thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.
p17
aVThey can use both my hands; I can use chording actions;
p18
aVI can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to.
p19
aVYou know, like that.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new.
p22
aVPeople like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.
p23
aVHowever, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution,
p24
aVlow-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.
p25
aVSo, the technology, you know,
p26
aVisn't the most exciting thing here right now,
p27
aVother than probably its newfound accessibility.
p28
aVWhat's really interesting here is what you can do with it
p29
aVand the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it.
p30
aVSo let's see.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here.
p33
aVNow, you can see,
p34
aVI can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together.
p35
aVI can inject heat into the system here,
p36
aVor I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.
p37
aVIt's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual.
p38
aVThe interface just kind of disappears.
p39
aVThis started out as a screensaver app
p40
aVthat one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.
p41
aVBut I think its true identity comes out here.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know,
p44
aVI could be doing this with as many fingers here,
p45
aVbut of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.
p46
aVChris could be interacting with another part of Lava,
p47
aVwhile I play around with it here.
p48
aVYou can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool,
p49
aVwhere I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable,
p50
aVand then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state.
p51
aVGoogle should have something like this in their lobby.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VI'll show you a little more of a concrete example here,
p56
aVas this thing loads.
p57
aVThis is a photographer's light-box application.
p58
aVAgain, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.
p59
aVBut what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers,
p60
aVI can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.
p61
aVI can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.
p62
aVI can do that grossly with both of my hands,
p63
aVor I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together.
p64
aVIf I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing \u2014 stretch it out.
p65
aVI can do it simultaneously, holding this down,
p66
aVand gripping on another one, stretching this out.
p67
aa(lp68
VAgain, the interface just disappears here.
p69
aVThere's no manual.
p70
aVThis is exactly what you expect,
p71
aVespecially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.
p72
aVNow, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop,
p73
aVI kind of cringe at the idea
p74
aVof introducing a whole new generation to computing
p75
aVwith this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface.
p76
aVThis is something that I think is really the way
p77
aVwe should be interacting with machines from now on.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Applause)
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd I can bring that around, put that up there.
p85
aVObviously, this is a standard keyboard,
p86
aVbut of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.
p87
aVThat's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age
p88
aVthat we should be conforming to a physical device.
p89
aVThat leads to bad things, like RSI.
p90
aVWe have so much technology nowadays
p91
aVthat these interfaces should start conforming to us.
p92
aVThere's so little applied now to actually improving
p93
aVthe way we interact with interfaces from this point on.
p94
aVThis keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go.
p95
aVYou can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology,
p96
aVa keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away,
p97
aVand really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke.
p98
aVSo \u2014 again, isn't this great?
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAudience: Where's your lab?
p103
aa(lp104
VJeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls.
p107
aVIt'll remember the strokes I'm making.
p108
aVOf course I can do it with all my hands.
p109
aVIt's pressure-sensitive.
p110
aVWhat's neat about that is,
p111
aVI showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly.
p112
aVBecause you don't have to switch to a hand tool
p113
aVor the magnifying glass tool,
p114
aVyou can just continuously make things
p115
aVin real multiple scales, all at the same time.
p116
aVI can create big things out here,
p117
aVbut I can go back and really quickly go back
p118
aVto where I started, and make even smaller things here.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis is going to be really important
p121
aVas we start getting to things like data visualization.
p122
aVFor instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,
p123
aVand he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time:
p124
aVWe have all this great data,
p125
aVbut for some reason, it's just sitting there.
p126
aVWe're not accessing it.
p127
aVAnd one of the reasons why I think that is
p128
aVwill be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools,
p129
aVbut I also think a big part of it
p130
aVis going to be having better interfaces,
p131
aVto be able to drill down into this kind of data,
p132
aVwhile still thinking about the big picture here.
p133
aa(lp134
VLet me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind.
p135
aVIt's done by NASA.
p136
aVWe've all seen Google Earth;
p137
aVthis is an open-source version of that.
p138
aVThere are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets
p139
aVthat NASA's collected over the years.
p140
aVAs you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures
p141
aVto go down and go in really seamlessly.
p142
aVThere's no interface, again.
p143
aVIt really allows anybody to kind of go in \u2014
p144
aVand it just does what you'd expect, you know?
p145
aVAgain, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears.
p146
aVI can switch to different data views.
p147
aVThat's what's neat about this app here.
p148
aVNASA's really cool.
p149
aVThese hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can \u2014
p150
aVit's really good for determining vegetative use.
p151
aVWell, let's go back to this.
p152
aa(lp153
VThe great thing about mapping applications \u2014
p154
aVit's not really 2D, it's 3D.
p155
aVSo, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this \u2014
p156
aVso you can be able to tilt around like that \u2014
p157
aa(lp158
V(Surprised laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VIt's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.
p161
aVThis gesture is just putting two fingers down \u2014
p162
aVit's defining an axis of tilt \u2014 and I can tilt up and down that way.
p163
aVWe just came up with that on the spot,
p164
aVit's probably not the right thing to do,
p165
aVbut there's such interesting things you can do with this interface.
p166
aVIt's just so much fun playing around with it, too.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd so the last thing I want to show you is \u2014
p171
aVI'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps
p172
aVthat you can do with this thing.
p173
aVI'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.
p174
aVNow, here's a simple application here \u2014 I can draw out a curve.
p175
aVAnd when I close it, it becomes a character.
p176
aVBut the neat thing about it is I can add control points.
p177
aVAnd then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.
p178
aVAnd you notice what it does.
p179
aVIt's kind of a puppeteering thing,
p180
aVwhere I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make \u2014
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, there's a lot of actual math going on under here
p183
aVfor this to control this mesh and do the right thing.
p184
aVThis technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points,
p185
aVis actually state of the art.
p186
aVIt was released at SIGGRAPH last year.
p187
aVIt's a great example of the kind of research I really love:
p188
aVall this compute power to make things do the right things,
p189
aVintuitive things, to do exactly what you expect.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI.
p192
aVI'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it.
p193
aVThis kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it,
p194
aVI'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days
p195
aVand seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you.
