VI'm a process engineer, I know all about boilers and incinerators
p4
aVand fabric filters, and cyclones, and things like that.
p5
aVBut I also have Marfan syndrome.
p6
aVThis is an inherited disorder.
p7
aVAnd in 1992, I participated in a genetic study,
p8
aVand found to my horror, as you can see from the slide,
p9
aVthat my ascending aorta was not in the normal range,
p10
aVthe green line at the bottom.
p11
aVEveryone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,
p12
aVand I was already up at 4.4.
p13
aVAnd as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively,
p14
aVand I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.
p17
aVAnesthetize you, open your chest,
p18
aVput you on an artificial heart and lung machine,
p19
aVdrop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade,
p20
aVstop your heart, cut the aorta out,
p21
aVreplace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta.
p22
aVAnd most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.
p23
aVNormally, warfarin.
p24
aVThe thought of the surgery was not attractive.
p25
aVThe thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo I said to myself,
p28
aV"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&D, this is just a plumbing problem."
p29
aV"I can do this, I can change this."
p30
aVSo I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation.
p31
aVThe project aim is really quite simple.
p32
aVThe only real problem with the ascending aorta
p33
aVin people with Marfan syndrome
p34
aVis that it lacks some tensile strength.
p35
aVSo, the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe,
p36
aVand it would remain stable and operate quite happily.
p37
aVIf your high-pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little,
p38
aVyou just wrap some tape around it, it really is that simple.
p39
aVIn concept, though not in execution.
p40
aVThe great advantage of an external support, for me,
p41
aVwas that I could retain all of my own bits,
p42
aVall of my own endothelium and valves,
p43
aVand not need any anticoagulation therapy.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, where do we start?
p46
aVThis is a sagittal slice through me.
p47
aVIn the middle, you can see that little structure squeezing out,
p48
aVthat's the left ventricle,
p49
aVpushing blood out through the aortic valve.
p50
aVYou can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there.
p51
aVUp into the ascending aorta.
p52
aVAnd it's that part, the ascending aorta,
p53
aVwhich dilates and ultimately bursts, which of course is fatal.
p54
aVWe started by organizing image acquisition
p55
aVfrom magnetic resonance and CT imaging machines,
p56
aVfrom which to make a model of the patient's aorta.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis is a model of my aorta.
p59
aVI've got a real one in my pocket,
p60
aVif anyone would like to look at it, and play with it.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VYou can see it's quite a complex structure.
p65
aVIt has a funny tri-lobal shape at the bottom,
p66
aVwhich contains the aortic valve.
p67
aVIt then comes back into a round form,
p68
aVand then tapers and curves off.
p69
aVIt's quite a difficult structure to produce.
p70
aVThis is a sort of CAD model of me,
p71
aVand this is one of the later CAD models.
p72
aVWe went through an iterative process of producing better and better models.
p73
aVWhen we produced that model,
p74
aVwe turned it into a solid, plastic model, as you can see,
p75
aVusing a rapid prototyping technique, another engineering technique.
p76
aVWe then used that former
p77
aVto manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh,
p78
aVwhich takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.
p79
aVSo this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best, really.
p80
aVEvery patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant.
p81
aa(lp82
VOnce you've made it, the installation is quite easy.
p83
aVJohn Pepper, bless his heart, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.
p84
aVNever done it before in his life, he put the first one in, didn't like it,
p85
aVhe put the second one in.
p86
aVHappy, away I went.
p87
aVFour and a half hours on the table, and everything was done.
p88
aVSo the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part.
p89
aa(lp90
VIf you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative,
p91
aVthe composite aortic root graft,
p92
aVthere are one or two startling comparisons
p93
aVwhich I'm sure will be clear to all of you.
p94
aVTwo hours to install one of our devices,
p95
aVcompared to 6 hours for the existing treatment.
p96
aVAs I said, the existing treatment requires the heart-lung bypass machine,
p97
aVand it requires a total body cooling.
p98
aVWe don't need any of that. We work on a beating heart.
p99
aVHe opens you up,
p100
aVhe accesses the aorta while your heart is beating,
p101
aVall at the right temperature.
p102
aVNo breaking into your circulatory system.
p103
aVSo it really is great.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut for me, absolutely the best point is,
p106
aVthere is no anticoagulation therapy required.
p107
aVI don't take any drugs at all,
p108
aVother than recreational ones that I would choose to take.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd in fact, if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin,
p113
aVit is a serious compromise to your quality of life,
p114
aVand even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.
p115
aVLikewise, if you have the artificial valve option,
p116
aVyou're committed to antibiotic therapy
p117
aVwhenever you have any intrusive medical treatment,
p118
aVeven trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics,
p119
aVin case you get an internal infection on the valve.
p120
aVAgain, I don't have any of that, so I'm entirely free,
p121
aVmy artery is fixed.
p122
aVI haven't got to worry about it, which is a rebirth for me.
p123
aa(lp124
VBack to the theme of the presentation, multidisciplinary research,
p125
aVhow on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers
p126
aVend up producing a medical device which transforms his own life?
p127
aVWell, the answer to that is, a multidisciplinary team.
p128
aVThis is a list of the core team,
p129
aVand you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there,
p130
aVmedicine and engineering,
p131
aVbut also, there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.
p132
aVJohn Pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the actual work on me.
p133
aVBut everyone else had to contribute one way or another.
p134
aVRaad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.
p135
aVWe had to get good-quality images from which to make the CAD model.
p136
aVWarren Thornton, who still does all our CAD models for us,
p137
aVhad to write a bespoke piece of CAD code
p138
aVto produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set.
p139
aa(lp140
VThere are some barriers to this, though, there are some problems.
p141
aVJargon is a big one.
p142
aVI would think no one in this room understands the first four jargon points.
p143
aVThe engineers amongst you will recognize "rapid prototyping" and "CAD."
p144
aVThe medics amongst you, if there are any, will recognize the first two,
p145
aVbut there will be nobody else here that understands all those four words.
p146
aVTaking the jargon out was very important
p147
aVto ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant
p148
aVwhen a particular phrase was used.
p149
aa(lp150
VOur disciplinary conventions were funny as well.
p151
aVWe took a lot of horizontal slice images through me,
p152
aVproduced those slices and used them to build a CAD model.
p153
aVAnd the very first CAD model we made,
p154
aVthe surgeons were playing with it and couldn't quite figure it out.
p155
aVAnd then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.
p156
aVAnd it was a mirror image because in the real world,
p157
aVwe always look down on plans,
p158
aVplans of houses, or streets, or maps.
p159
aVIn the medical world, they look up at plans.
p160
aVSo the horizontal images were all in inversion.
p161
aVSo, one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.
p162
aVEveryone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not.
p163
aa(lp164
VInstitutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.
p165
aVThe Brompton Hospital was taken over
p166
aVby the Imperial College School of Medicine.
p167
aVAnd there are some seriously bad relationship problems
p168
aVbetween the two organizations.
p169
aVI was working with the Imperial and the Brompton,
p170
aVand this generated some serious problems for the project.
p171
aVReally, problems that shouldn't exist.
p172
aa(lp173
VResearch & Ethics Committee.
p174
aVIf you want to do anything new in surgery,
p175
aVyou have to get a license from your local Research & Ethics.
p176
aVI'm sure it's the same in Poland.
p177
aVThere will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery.
p178
aVWe didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that,
p179
aVwe also had professional jealousies.
p180
aVThere were people on the Research & Ethics committee
p181
aVwho really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again.
p182
aVBecause he is so successful.
p183
aVAnd they made extra problems for us.
p184
aa(lp185
VBureaucratic problems.
p186
aVUltimately, when you have a new treatment,
p187
aVyou have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country.
p188
aVIn the UK, we have the National Institute and Clinical Excellence.
p189
aVYou have an equivalent in Poland, no doubt.
p190
aVAnd we had to get past the NICE problem.
p191
aVWe now have a great clinical guidance, out on the net.
p192
aVSo any other hospitals interested can come along, read the NICE report,
p193
aVget in touch with us, and then get doing it themselves.
p194
aa(lp195
VFunding barriers, another big area to be concerned with.
p196
aVA big problem with understanding one of those perspectives.
p197
aVWhen we first approached one of the big, charitable UK organizations
p198
aVthat fund this kind of stuff,
p199
aVwe essentially gave them an engineering proposal.
p200
aVThey didn't understand it, they were doctors, next to God,
p201
aVit must be rubbish, they binned it.
p202
aVSo in the end, I went after private investors, just gave up on it.
p203
aVMost R&D is going to be institutionally funded,
p204
aVby the Polish Academy of Sciences
p205
aVor the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, or whatever.
p206
aVAnd you need to get past those people.
p207
aa(lp208
VJargon is a huge problem when you try to work across disciplines,
p209
aVbecause in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and RP.
p210
aVNot in the medical world.
p211
aVI suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together.
p212
aVThey've really got to start talking to each other,
p213
aVand exercise a bit of imagination, if that's not too much to ask.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VWhich it probably is.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VI've coined the phrase "obstructive conservatism."
p222
aVSo many people in the medical world don't want to change.
p223
aVParticularly when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer.
p224
aVThey don't want to change.
p225
aVThey simply want to do whatever they've done before.
p226
aVAnd in fact, many surgeons in the UK are still waiting
p227
aVfor one of our patients to have some sort of an episode,
p228
aVso that they could say, "Told you that was no good."
p229
aVWe've actually got 30 patients.
p230
aVAt seven and a half years,
p231
aVwe've got 90 post-op patient years between us,
p232
aVand we haven't had a single problem.
p233
aVAnd still, there are people in the UK saying,
p234
aV"That external aortic root, it will never work, you know."
p235
aa(lp236
VIt really is a problem.
p237
aVI'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance
p238
aVamongst medics, doctors, surgeons, at some point.
p239
aVThe middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.
p240
aV"Well, of course, I'm looking after my patient."
p241
aVI think it's not good, but that's my view.
p242
aa(lp243
VEgos, of course, again a huge problem.
p244
aVIf you work in a multidisciplinary team,
p245
aVyou've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt,
p246
aVyou've got to express support for them.
p247
aVTom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.
p248
aVIncredible guy.
p249
aVDead easy to give him respect.
p250
aVHim giving me respect? Slightly different.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VThat's all the bad news.
p255
aVThe good news is, the benefits are stonkingly huge.
p256
aVTranslate that one! I bet they can't.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VWhen you have a group of people with different professional training,
p261
aVa different professional experience,
p262
aVthey not only have a different knowledge base,
p263
aVbut also a different perspective on everything.
p264
aVAnd if you can bring them together,
p265
aVand get them talking and understanding each other,
p266
aVthe results can be spectacular.
p267
aVYou can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before,
p268
aVvery quickly and easily.
p269
aVYou can short-cut huge amounts of work
p270
aVsimply by using the extended knowledge base you have.
p271
aVAnd as a result, it's an entirely different use
p272
aVof the technology and the knowledge around you.
p273
aa(lp274
VThe result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress
p275
aVon incredibly small budgets.
p276
aVI'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea
p277
aVto me being implanted
p278
aVthat I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost,
p279
aVbecause I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments,
p280
aVprobably in the USA,
p281
aVwhich cost more for a one-off patient
p282
aVthan the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.
p283
aa(lp284
VThat's all I want to say, and I've got three minutes left.
p285
aVSo, Ewa's going to like me.
p286
aVIf you have any questions, please come up and talk to me later on,
p287
aVit would be a pleasure to speak with you.
p288
aa(lp289
VMany thanks.
