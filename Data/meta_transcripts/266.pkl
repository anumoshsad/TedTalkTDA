VBeing a child, and sort of crawling around the house,
p4
aVI remember these Turkish carpets,
p5
aVand there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
p6
aVI mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear
p7
aVfrom this soldier.
p8
aVAnd my mom took these pictures actually, last week,
p9
aVof our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
p10
aVThere was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture
p11
aVwith creatures and gargoyles and nudity \u2014
p12
aVpretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,
p15
aVso storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
p16
aVAnd then there was another influence.
p17
aVI was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,
p18
aVwe want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
p19
aVAnd so,
p20
aVI fused together the two things I loved the most,
p21
aVwhich was skiing and windsurfing.
p22
aVThose are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, I created this compilation of the two:
p25
aVI took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,
p26
aVand some foot straps, and some metal fins,
p27
aVand here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
p28
aVIt was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,
p29
aVit worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
p30
aVAnd I realized then I had to go to design school.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVI mean, look at those graphics there.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, I went to design school,
p36
aVand it was the early '90s when I finished.
p37
aVAnd I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,
p38
aVso I wanted to be there,
p39
aVand I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,
p40
aVthat it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
p41
aVAnd so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,
p42
aVand we would get in to these meetings,
p43
aVand these managers would come in,
p44
aVand they would say,
p45
aV"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
p46
aVAnd they would give the projects code names, you know,
p47
aVmostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
p48
aVSo, in anticipation, I would be this young designer
p49
aVin the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,
p50
aVand I would ask questions.
p51
aVI mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,
p52
aVbut things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
p53
aVor "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?
p54
aV"You know, do people really use it?
p55
aVDo they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VWhat I realized then is, they didn't really want to change
p59
aVthe legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.
p60
aVThey were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,
p61
aVto put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
p62
aVAnd I didn't want to be a colorist.
p63
aVIt wasn't what I wanted to do.
p64
aVI didn't want to be a stylist in this way.
p65
aVAnd then I saw this quote:
p66
aV"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,
p70
aVand I started a little company, fuseproject.
p71
aVAnd what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
p72
aVAnd I wanted to really not just work on the skins,
p73
aVbut I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
p74
aVAnd so the first projects were sort of humble,
p75
aVbut they took technology and maybe made it into things
p76
aVthat people would use in a new way,
p77
aVand maybe finding some new functionality.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,
p80
aVright when it launched,
p81
aVand it's the first watch that has a display
p82
aVthat switches from horizontal to vertical.
p83
aVAnd that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,
p84
aVwithout bending my elbow.
p85
aVAnd other projects, which were really about transformation,
p86
aVabout matching the human need.
p87
aVThis is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,
p88
aVand it ships completely flat,
p89
aVand then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.
p90
aVAnd something a little bit more experimental:
p91
aVthis is a light fixture for Swarovski,
p92
aVand what it does is, it changes shape.
p93
aVSo, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
p94
aVAnd just by drawing on a little computer tablet,
p95
aVthe entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
p98
aVThis is a pretty involved process;
p99
aVit took us about four and a half years.
p100
aVBut I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,
p101
aVa new experience of light.
p102
aVSo, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
p103
aVAnd that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
p104
aVAnd the new experience I was looking for
p105
aVis giving the choice for the user to go from
p106
aVa warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,
p107
aVall the way to a bright work light.
p108
aVSo, the light bulb actually does that.
p109
aVIt allows the person to switch,
p110
aVand to mix these two colorations.
p111
aVAnd it's done in a very simple way:
p112
aVone just touches the base of the light,
p113
aVand on one side, you can mix the brightness,
p114
aVand on the other, the coloration of the light.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,
p117
aVand I think as designers we need to really think
p118
aVabout how we can create a different relationship
p119
aVbetween our work and the world,
p120
aVwhether it's for business,
p121
aVor, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.
p122
aVBecause I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring
p123
aVvalue to business, value to the users also,
p124
aVbut I think it's the values that we put into these projects
p125
aVthat ultimately create the greater value.
p126
aVAnd the values we bring
p127
aVcan be about environmental issues,
p128
aVabout sustainability, about lower power consumption.
p129
aVYou know, they can be about function and beauty;
p130
aVthey can be about business strategy.
p131
aVBut designers are really the glue
p132
aVthat brings these things together.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,
p135
aVand it has a humanistic technology.
p136
aVIt feels your skin. It rests on your skin,
p137
aVand it knows when it is you're talking.
p138
aVAnd by knowing when it is you're talking,
p139
aVit gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,
p140
aVwhich is the environmental noises.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone
p143
aVis that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,
p144
aVand all the nerdy stuff out of it,
p145
aVand try to make it as beautiful as we can.
p146
aVI mean, think about it:
p147
aVthe care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,
p148
aVor accessories is really important,
p149
aVso if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.
p150
aVAnd this is what we're pursuing here.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
p153
aVI want to point at something here, on the left.
p154
aVThis is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside
p155
aVthat makes this technology work.
p156
aVBut this is the design process:
p157
aVthere's somebody changing the board,
p158
aVputting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,
p159
aVas the designers on the other side are doing the work.
p160
aVSo, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
p161
aVIt's really about designing from the inside out.
p162
aVAnd then, on the other side of the room,
p163
aVthe designers are making small adjustments,
p164
aVsketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
p165
aVAnd it's what I call being design driven.
p166
aVYou know, there is some push and pull,
p167
aVbut design is really helping define
p168
aVthe whole experience from the inside out.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd then, of course, design is never done.
p171
aVAnd this is \u2014 the other new way that is unique
p172
aVin how we work is, because it's never done,
p173
aVyou have to do all this other stuff.
p174
aVThe packaging, and the website, and you need to continue
p175
aVto really touch the user, in many ways.
p176
aVBut how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
p177
aVAnd Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,
p178
aVyou know, really understands that you need a different structure.
p179
aVSo, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,
p180
aVit's a partnership. We can continue to work
p181
aVand dedicate ourselves to this project,
p182
aVand then we also share in the rewards.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd here's another project, another partnership-type approach.
p185
aVThis is called Y Water,
p186
aVand it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,
p187
aVAustrian originally, who came to us,
p188
aVand all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,
p189
aVor an organic drink for his kids,
p190
aVto replace the high-sugar-content sodas
p191
aVthat he's trying to get them away from.
p192
aVSo, we worked on this bottle,
p193
aVand it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
p194
aVAnd this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
p195
aVThe bottles connect together,
p196
aVand you can create different shapes, different forms.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aV(Applause)
p199
aVThank you.
p200
aV(Applause)
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd then while we were doing this,
p203
aVthe shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,
p204
aVand then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"
p205
aVare probably the most important words that kids ask.
p206
aVSo we called it Y Water. And so this is
p207
aVanother place where it all comes together in the same room:
p208
aVthe three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,
p209
aVit all becomes deeply connected.
p210
aVAnd then the other thing about this project is,
p211
aVwe bring intellectual property,
p212
aVwe bring a marketing approach,
p213
aVwe bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,
p214
aVwhat we bring is these values,
p215
aVand these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
p216
aVAnd it's especially rewarding when your design work
p217
aVbecomes a creative endeavor,
p218
aVwhen others can be creative and do more with it.
p219
aa(lp220
VHere's another project,
p221
aVwhich I think really emulates that.
p222
aVThis is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
p223
aVThis picture is incredible.
p224
aVIn Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
p225
aVThis girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
p226
aVI mean, to me, it just means so much.
p227
aVBut when Nicholas Negroponte \u2014
p228
aVand he has spoken about this project a lot,
p229
aVhe's the founder of OLPC \u2014 came to us
p230
aVabout two and a half years ago,
p231
aVthere were some clear ideas.
p232
aVHe wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,
p233
aVand those are pillars of his life,
p234
aVbut also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
p235
aVBut the third pillar that he talked about was design.
p236
aVAnd at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.
p237
aVI didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
p238
aVBut what he said was really significant,
p239
aVis that design was going to be why the kids
p240
aVwere going to love this product,
p241
aVhow we were going to make it low cost, robust.
p242
aVAnd plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key \u2014
p243
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p244
aVand the Num Lock key, too.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,
p247
aVto look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
p248
aVAnd then the integration of
p249
aVall these great technologies, which you've heard about,
p250
aVthe Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;
p251
aVthe screen, which you can read in sunlight;
p252
aVthe keyboard, which is made out of rubber,
p253
aVand it's protected from the environment.
p254
aa(lp255
VYou know, all these great technologies really happened
p256
aVbecause of the passion and
p257
aVthe OLPC people and the engineers.
p258
aVThey fought the suppliers,
p259
aVthey fought the manufacturers.
p260
aVI mean, they fought like animals
p261
aVfor this to remain they way it is.
p262
aVAnd in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one \u2014
p263
aVallows the process
p264
aVfrom not destroying the original idea.
p265
aVAnd I think this is something really important.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, now you get these pictures \u2014
p268
aVyou get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria
p269
aVand you see them in Uruguay
p270
aVwith their computers, and in Mongolia.
p271
aVAnd we went away from obviously the beige.
p272
aVI mean it's colorful, it's fun.
p273
aVIn fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
p274
aVIt's because we were able
p275
aVto run, during the manufacturing process,
p276
aV20 colors for the X and the O,
p277
aVwhich is the name of the computer,
p278
aVand by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,
p279
aVyou get 20 times 20: you get
p280
aV400 different options there.
p281
aVSo, the lessons from seeing the kids
p282
aVusing them in the developing world are incredible.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,
p285
aVand he had the laptop for an afternoon,
p286
aVand I had to take it back. It was hard.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVAnd it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,
p289
aVI come back to Switzerland,
p290
aVand there he is playing with his own version.
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aVLike paper, paper and cardboard.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, I'm going to finish with one last project,
p295
aVand this is a little bit more of adult play.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVSome of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
p298
aVIt's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,
p299
aVFebruary 14, about 10 days ago.
p300
aVSo, the Department of Health in New York came to us,
p301
aVand they needed a way to distribute
p302
aV36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
p303
aVSo a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
p304
aVThese are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.
p305
aVIt's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,
p306
aVand it has to be easily serviceable:
p307
aVyou have to know where it is and what it does.
p308
aVAnd we also designed the condoms themselves.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I was just in New York at the launch,
p311
aVand I went to see all these places where they're installed:
p312
aVthis is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;
p313
aVat a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
p314
aVI mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics \u2014 everywhere.
p315
aVOf course, clubs and discos, too.
p316
aVAnd here's the public service announcement for this project.
p317
aV(Music)
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVGet some.
p320
aV(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, this is really where design
p323
aVis able to create a conversation.
p324
aVI was in these venues, and people were,
p325
aVyou know, really into getting them. They were excited.
p326
aVIt was breaking the ice,
p327
aVit was getting over a stigma,
p328
aVand I think that's also what design can do.
p329
aVSo, I was going to
p330
aVthrow some condoms in the room and whatnot,
p331
aVbut I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVYeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aVSo, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVAnd if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,
p339
aVyou can just say you like the design.
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VSo, I'll finish with just one thought:
p343
aVif we all work together on creating value,
p344
aVbut if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,
p345
aVI think we can change the work that we do.
p346
aVWe can change these values, can change the companies we work with,
p347
aVand eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
p348
aVSo, thank you.
