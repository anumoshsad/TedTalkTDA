VChris Anderson: The rights of citizens,
p4
aVthe future of the Internet.
p5
aVSo I would like to welcome to the TED stage
p6
aVthe man behind those revelations,
p7
aVEd Snowden.
p8
aV(Applause)
p9
aVEd is in a remote location somewhere in Russia
p10
aVcontrolling this bot from his laptop,
p11
aVso he can see what the bot can see.
p12
aVEd, welcome to the TED stage.
p13
aVWhat can you see, as a matter of fact?
p14
aa(lp15
VEdward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.
p16
aVThis is amazing.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VCA: Ed, some questions for you.
p20
aVYou've been called many things
p21
aVin the last few months.
p22
aVYou've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,
p23
aVa hero.
p24
aVWhat words would you describe yourself with?
p25
aa(lp26
VES: You know, everybody who is involved
p27
aVwith this debate
p28
aVhas been struggling over me and my personality
p29
aVand how to describe me.
p30
aVBut when I think about it,
p31
aVthis isn't the question that we should be struggling with.
p32
aVWho I am really doesn't matter at all.
p33
aVIf I'm the worst person in the world,
p34
aVyou can hate me and move on.
p35
aVWhat really matters here are the issues.
p36
aVWhat really matters here is the kind of government we want,
p37
aVthe kind of Internet we want,
p38
aVthe kind of relationship between people
p39
aVand societies.
p40
aVAnd that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards,
p41
aVand we've seen that increasing over time.
p42
aVIf I had to describe myself,
p43
aVI wouldn't use words like "hero."
p44
aVI wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."
p45
aVI'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,
p46
aVjust like everyone else.
p47
aa(lp48
VCA: So just to give some context
p49
aVfor those who don't know the whole story \u2014
p50
aV(Applause) \u2014
p51
aVthis time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii
p52
aVworking as a consultant to the NSA.
p53
aVAs a sysadmin, you had access
p54
aVto their systems,
p55
aVand you began revealing certain classified documents
p56
aVto some handpicked journalists
p57
aVleading the way to June's revelations.
p58
aVNow, what propelled you to do this?
p59
aVES: You know,
p60
aVwhen I was sitting in Hawaii,
p61
aVand the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community,
p62
aVI saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.
p63
aVWe do a lot of good things in the intelligence community,
p64
aVthings that need to be done,
p65
aVand things that help everyone.
p66
aVBut there are also things that go too far.
p67
aVThere are things that shouldn't be done,
p68
aVand decisions that were being made in secret
p69
aVwithout the public's awareness,
p70
aVwithout the public's consent,
p71
aVand without even our representatives in government
p72
aVhaving knowledge of these programs.
p73
aVWhen I really came to struggle with these issues,
p74
aVI thought to myself,
p75
aVhow can I do this in the most responsible way,
p76
aVthat maximizes the public benefit
p77
aVwhile minimizing the risks?
p78
aVAnd out of all the solutions that I could come up with,
p79
aVout of going to Congress,
p80
aVwhen there were no laws,
p81
aVthere were no legal protections
p82
aVfor a private employee,
p83
aVa contractor in intelligence like myself,
p84
aVthere was a risk that I would be buried along with the information
p85
aVand the public would never find out.
p86
aVBut the First Amendment of the United States Constitution
p87
aVguarantees us a free press for a reason,
p88
aVand that's to enable an adversarial press,
p89
aVto challenge the government,
p90
aVbut also to work together with the government,
p91
aVto have a dialogue and debate about how we can
p92
aVinform the public about matters of vital importance
p93
aVwithout putting our national security at risk.
p94
aVAnd by working with journalists,
p95
aVby giving all of my information
p96
aVback to the American people,
p97
aVrather than trusting myself to make
p98
aVthe decisions about publication,
p99
aVwe've had a robust debate
p100
aVwith a deep investment by the government
p101
aVthat I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.
p102
aVAnd the risks that have been threatened,
p103
aVthe risks that have been played up
p104
aVby the government
p105
aVhave never materialized.
p106
aVWe've never seen any evidence
p107
aVof even a single instance of specific harm,
p108
aVand because of that,
p109
aVI'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.
p110
aa(lp111
VCA: So let me show the audience
p112
aVa couple of examples of what you revealed.
p113
aVIf we could have a slide up, and Ed,
p114
aVI don't know whether you can see,
p115
aVthe slides are here.
p116
aVThis is a slide of the PRISM program,
p117
aVand maybe you could tell the audience
p118
aVwhat that was that was revealed.
p119
aa(lp120
VES: The best way to understand PRISM,
p121
aVbecause there's been a little bit of controversy,
p122
aVis to first talk about what PRISM isn't.
p123
aVMuch of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata.
p124
aVThey've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,
p125
aVand they're talking about a specific legal authority
p126
aVcalled Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
p127
aVThat allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,
p128
aVmass surveillance of the entire country's
p129
aVphone records, things like that \u2014
p130
aVwho you're talking to,
p131
aVwhen you're talking to them,
p132
aVwhere you traveled.
p133
aVThese are all metadata events.
p134
aVPRISM is about content.
p135
aVIt's a program through which the government could
p136
aVcompel corporate America,
p137
aVit could deputize corporate America
p138
aVto do its dirty work for the NSA.
p139
aVAnd even though some of these companies did resist,
p140
aVeven though some of them \u2014
p141
aVI believe Yahoo was one of them \u2014
p142
aVchallenged them in court, they all lost,
p143
aVbecause it was never tried by an open court.
p144
aVThey were only tried by a secret court.
p145
aVAnd something that we've seen,
p146
aVsomething about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is,
p147
aVthere's been a talking point in the U.S. government
p148
aVwhere they've said 15 federal judges
p149
aVhave reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful,
p150
aVbut what they don't tell you
p151
aVis those are secret judges
p152
aVin a secret court
p153
aVbased on secret interpretations of law
p154
aVthat's considered 34,000 warrant requests
p155
aVover 33 years,
p156
aVand in 33 years only rejected
p157
aV11 government requests.
p158
aVThese aren't the people that we want deciding
p159
aVwhat the role of corporate America
p160
aVin a free and open Internet should be.
p161
aa(lp162
VCA: Now, this slide that we're showing here
p163
aVshows the dates in which
p164
aVdifferent technology companies, Internet companies,
p165
aVare alleged to have joined the program,
p166
aVand where data collection began from them.
p167
aVNow, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.
p168
aVHow was that data collected by the NSA?
p169
aa(lp170
VES: Right. So the NSA's own slides
p171
aVrefer to it as direct access.
p172
aVWhat that means to an actual NSA analyst,
p173
aVsomeone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst
p174
aVtargeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,
p175
aVthings like that, in Hawaii,
p176
aVis the provenance of that data
p177
aVis directly from their servers.
p178
aVIt doesn't mean
p179
aVthat there's a group of company representatives
p180
aVsitting in a smoky room with the NSA
p181
aVpalling around and making back-room deals
p182
aVabout how they're going to give this stuff away.
p183
aVNow each company handles it different ways.
p184
aVSome are responsible.
p185
aVSome are somewhat less responsible.
p186
aVBut the bottom line is, when we talk about
p187
aVhow this information is given,
p188
aVit's coming from the companies themselves.
p189
aVIt's not stolen from the lines.
p190
aVBut there's an important thing to remember here:
p191
aVeven though companies pushed back,
p192
aVeven though companies demanded,
p193
aVhey, let's do this through a warrant process,
p194
aVlet's do this
p195
aVwhere we actually have some sort of legal review,
p196
aVsome sort of basis for handing over
p197
aVthese users' data,
p198
aVwe saw stories in the Washington Post last year
p199
aVthat weren't as well reported as the PRISM story
p200
aVthat said the NSA broke in
p201
aVto the data center communications
p202
aVbetween Google to itself
p203
aVand Yahoo to itself.
p204
aVSo even these companies that are cooperating
p205
aVin at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner
p206
aVwith the NSA,
p207
aVthe NSA isn't satisfied with that,
p208
aVand because of that, we need our companies
p209
aVto work very hard
p210
aVto guarantee that they're going to represent
p211
aVthe interests of the user, and also advocate
p212
aVfor the rights of the users.
p213
aVAnd I think over the last year,
p214
aVwe've seen the companies that are named
p215
aVon the PRISM slides
p216
aVtake great strides to do that,
p217
aVand I encourage them to continue.
p218
aa(lp219
VCA: What more should they do?
p220
aa(lp221
VES: The biggest thing that an Internet company
p222
aVin America can do today, right now,
p223
aVwithout consulting with lawyers,
p224
aVto protect the rights of users worldwide,
p225
aVis to enable SSL web encryption
p226
aVon every page you visit.
p227
aVThe reason this matters is today,
p228
aVif you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,
p229
aVthe NSA can see a record of that,
p230
aVthe Russian intelligence service can see a record of that,
p231
aVthe Chinese service can see a record of that,
p232
aVthe French service, the German service,
p233
aVthe services of Andorra.
p234
aVThey can all see it because it's unencrypted.
p235
aVThe world's library is Amazon.com,
p236
aVbut not only do they not support encryption by default,
p237
aVyou cannot choose to use encryption
p238
aVwhen browsing through books.
p239
aVThis is something that we need to change,
p240
aVnot just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,
p241
aVbut they're a great example.
p242
aVAll companies need to move
p243
aVto an encrypted browsing habit by default
p244
aVfor all users who haven't taken any action
p245
aVor picked any special methods on their own.
p246
aVThat'll increase the privacy and the rights
p247
aVthat people enjoy worldwide.
p248
aa(lp249
VCA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.
p250
aVI want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)
p251
aVThis is a program called Boundless Informant.
p252
aVWhat is that?
p253
aa(lp254
VES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA
p255
aVfor using appropriate names on this.
p256
aVThis is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.
p257
aVBoundless Informant
p258
aVis a program that the NSA hid from Congress.
p259
aVThe NSA was previously asked by Congress,
p260
aVwas there any ability that they had
p261
aVto even give a rough ballpark estimate
p262
aVof the amount of American communications
p263
aVthat were being intercepted.
p264
aVThey said no. They said, we don't track those stats,
p265
aVand we can't track those stats.
p266
aVWe can't tell you how many communications
p267
aVwe're intercepting around the world,
p268
aVbecause to tell you that would be
p269
aVto invade your privacy.
p270
aVNow, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,
p271
aVbut the reality, when you look at this slide is,
p272
aVnot only do they have the capability,
p273
aVthe capability already exists.
p274
aVIt's already in place.
p275
aVThe NSA has its own internal data format
p276
aVthat tracks both ends of a communication,
p277
aVand if it says,
p278
aVthis communication came from America,
p279
aVthey can tell Congress how many of those communications
p280
aVthey have today, right now.
p281
aVAnd what Boundless Informant tells us
p282
aVis more communications are being intercepted
p283
aVin America about Americans
p284
aVthan there are in Russia about Russians.
p285
aVI'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency
p286
aVshould be aiming for.
p287
aa(lp288
VCA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post,
p289
aVagain from your data.
p290
aVThe headline says,
p291
aV"NSA broke privacy rules
p292
aVthousands of times per year."
p293
aVTell us about that.
p294
aa(lp295
VES: We also heard in Congressional testimony last year,
p296
aVit was an amazing thing for someone like me
p297
aVwho came from the NSA
p298
aVand who's seen the actual internal documents,
p299
aVknows what's in them,
p300
aVto see officials testifying under oath
p301
aVthat there had been no abuses,
p302
aVthat there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,
p303
aVwhen we knew this story was coming.
p304
aVBut what's especially interesting about this,
p305
aVabout the fact that the NSA has violated
p306
aVtheir own rules, their own laws
p307
aVthousands of times in a single year,
p308
aVincluding one event by itself,
p309
aVone event out of those 2,776,
p310
aVthat affected more than 3,000 people.
p311
aVIn another event, they intercepted
p312
aVall the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.
p313
aVWhat's amazing about this,
p314
aVthis report, that didn't get that much attention,
p315
aVis the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,
p316
aVthe chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
p317
aVDianne Feinstein, had not seen this report
p318
aVuntil the Washington Post contacted her
p319
aVasking for comment on the report.
p320
aVAnd she then requested a copy from the NSA
p321
aVand received it,
p322
aVbut had never seen this before that.
p323
aVWhat does that say about the state of oversight
p324
aVin American intelligence
p325
aVwhen the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
p326
aVhas no idea that the rules are being broken
p327
aVthousands of times every year?
p328
aa(lp329
VCA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:
p330
aVWhy should we care about
p331
aVall this surveillance, honestly?
p332
aVI mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,
p333
aVyou've got nothing to worry about.
p334
aVWhat's wrong with that point of view?
p335
aVES: Well, so the first thing is,
p336
aVyou're giving up your rights.
p337
aVYou're saying hey, you know,
p338
aVI don't think I'm going to need them,
p339
aVso I'm just going to trust that, you know,
p340
aVlet's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,
p341
aVthese guys are going to do the right thing.
p342
aVYour rights matter
p343
aVbecause you never know when you're going to need them.
p344
aVBeyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,
p345
aVnot just in America,
p346
aVbut in Western societies
p347
aVand in democratic societies around the world.
p348
aVPeople should be able to pick up the phone
p349
aVand to call their family,
p350
aVpeople should be able to send a text message
p351
aVto their loved ones,
p352
aVpeople should be able to buy a book online,
p353
aVthey should be able to travel by train,
p354
aVthey should be able to buy an airline ticket
p355
aVwithout wondering about how these events
p356
aVare going to look to an agent of the government,
p357
aVpossibly not even your government
p358
aVyears in the future,
p359
aVhow they're going to be misinterpreted
p360
aVand what they're going to think your intentions were.
p361
aVWe have a right to privacy.
p362
aVWe require warrants to be based on probable cause
p363
aVor some kind of individualized suspicion
p364
aVbecause we recognize that trusting anybody,
p365
aVany government authority,
p366
aVwith the entirety of human communications
p367
aVin secret and without oversight
p368
aVis simply too great a temptation to be ignored.
p369
aa(lp370
VCA: Some people are furious at what you've done.
p371
aVI heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney
p372
aVwho said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,
p373
aVEdward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog.
p374
aVHe thinks you've committed
p375
aVone of the worst acts of betrayal
p376
aVin American history.
p377
aVWhat would you say to people who think that?
p378
aa(lp379
VES: Dick Cheney's really something else.
p380
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p381
aVThank you. (Laughter)
p382
aVI think it's amazing, because at the time
p383
aVJulian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,
p384
aVDick Cheney was saying
p385
aVhe was going to end governments worldwide,
p386
aVthe skies were going to ignite
p387
aVand the seas were going to boil off,
p388
aVand now he's saying it's a flea bite.
p389
aVSo we should be suspicious about the same sort of
p390
aVoverblown claims of damage to national security
p391
aVfrom these kind of officials.
p392
aVBut let's assume that these people really believe this.
p393
aVI would argue that they have kind of
p394
aVa narrow conception of national security.
p395
aVThe prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney
p396
aVdo not keep the nation safe.
p397
aVThe public interest is not always the same
p398
aVas the national interest.
p399
aVGoing to war with people who are not our enemy
p400
aVin places that are not a threat
p401
aVdoesn't make us safe,
p402
aVand that applies whether it's in Iraq
p403
aVor on the Internet.
p404
aVThe Internet is not the enemy.
p405
aVOur economy is not the enemy.
p406
aVAmerican businesses, Chinese businesses,
p407
aVand any other company out there
p408
aVis a part of our society.
p409
aVIt's a part of our interconnected world.
p410
aVThere are ties of fraternity that bond us together,
p411
aVand if we destroy these bonds
p412
aVby undermining the standards, the security,
p413
aVthe manner of behavior,
p414
aVthat nations and citizens all around the world
p415
aVexpect us to abide by.
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: But it's alleged that you've stolen
p418
aV1.7 million documents.
p419
aVIt seems only a few hundred of them
p420
aVhave been shared with journalists so far.
p421
aVAre there more revelations to come?
p422
aa(lp423
VES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.
p424
aVI don't think there's any question
p425
aVthat some of the most important reporting
p426
aVto be done is yet to come.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: Come here, because I want to ask you
p429
aVabout this particular revelation.
p430
aVCome and take a look at this.
p431
aVI mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room
p432
aVis the single most shocking thing
p433
aVthat they have heard in the last few months.
p434
aVIt's about a program called "Bullrun."
p435
aVCan you explain what that is?
p436
aa(lp437
VES: So Bullrun, and this is again
p438
aVwhere we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,
p439
aVthis is a program named after a Civil War battle.
p440
aVThe British counterpart is called Edgehill,
p441
aVwhich is a U.K. civil war battle.
p442
aVAnd the reason that I believe they're named this way
p443
aVis because they target our own infrastructure.
p444
aVThey're programs through which the NSA
p445
aVintentionally misleads corporate partners.
p446
aVThey tell corporate partners that these
p447
aVare safe standards.
p448
aVThey say hey, we need to work with you
p449
aVto secure your systems,
p450
aVbut in reality, they're giving bad advice
p451
aVto these companies that makes them
p452
aVdegrade the security of their services.
p453
aVThey're building in backdoors that not only
p454
aVthe NSA can exploit,
p455
aVbut anyone else who has time and money
p456
aVto research and find it
p457
aVcan then use to let themselves in
p458
aVto the world's communications.
p459
aVAnd this is really dangerous,
p460
aVbecause if we lose a single standard,
p461
aVif we lose the trust of something like SSL,
p462
aVwhich was specifically targeted
p463
aVby the Bullrun program,
p464
aVwe will live a less safe world overall.
p465
aVWe won't be able to access our banks
p466
aVand we won't be able to access commerce
p467
aVwithout worrying about people monitoring those communications
p468
aVor subverting them for their own ends.
p469
aa(lp470
VCA: And do those same decisions also potentially
p471
aVopen America up to cyberattacks
p472
aVfrom other sources?
p473
aa(lp474
VES: Absolutely.
p475
aVOne of the problems,
p476
aVone of the dangerous legacies
p477
aVthat we've seen in the post-9/11 era,
p478
aVis that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.
p479
aVThey've been in charge of offensive operations,
p480
aVthat is hacking,
p481
aVbut they've also been in charge of defensive operations,
p482
aVand traditionally they've always prioritized
p483
aVdefense over offense
p484
aVbased on the principle
p485
aVthat American secrets are simply worth more.
p486
aVIf we hack a Chinese business
p487
aVand steal their secrets,
p488
aVif we hack a government office in Berlin
p489
aVand steal their secrets,
p490
aVthat has less value to the American people
p491
aVthan making sure that the Chinese
p492
aVcan't get access to our secrets.
p493
aVSo by reducing the security of our communications,
p494
aVthey're not only putting the world at risk,
p495
aVthey're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,
p496
aVbecause intellectual property is the basis,
p497
aVthe foundation of our economy,
p498
aVand if we put that at risk through weak security,
p499
aVwe're going to be paying for it for years.
p500
aa(lp501
VCA: But they've made a calculation
p502
aVthat it was worth doing this
p503
aVas part of America's defense against terrorism.
p504
aVSurely that makes it a price worth paying.
p505
aa(lp506
VES: Well, when you look at the results
p507
aVof these programs in stopping terrorism,
p508
aVyou will see that that's unfounded,
p509
aVand you don't have to take my word for it,
p510
aVbecause we've had the first open court,
p511
aVthe first federal court that's reviewed this,
p512
aVoutside the secrecy arrangement,
p513
aVcalled these programs Orwellian
p514
aVand likely unconstitutional.
p515
aVCongress, who has access
p516
aVto be briefed on these things,
p517
aVand now has the desire to be,
p518
aVhas produced bills to reform it,
p519
aVand two independent White House panels
p520
aVwho reviewed all of the classified evidence
p521
aVsaid these programs have never stopped
p522
aVa single terrorist attack
p523
aVthat was imminent in the United States.
p524
aVSo is it really terrorism that we're stopping?
p525
aVDo these programs have any value at all?
p526
aVI say no, and all three branches
p527
aVof the American government say no as well.
p528
aa(lp529
VCA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation
p530
aVfor them than the war against terrorism?
p531
aa(lp532
VES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?
p533
aa(lp534
VCA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation
p535
aVfor them other than the war against terrorism?
p536
aa(lp537
VES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism
p538
aVhas always been what we in the intelligence world
p539
aVwould call a cover for action.
p540
aVTerrorism is something that provokes
p541
aVan emotional response that allows people
p542
aVto rationalize authorizing powers and programs
p543
aVthat they wouldn't give otherwise.
p544
aVThe Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,
p545
aVthe NSA asked for these authorities
p546
aVback in the 1990s.
p547
aVThey asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case.
p548
aVThe FBI went to Congress and did make the case.
p549
aVBut Congress and the American people said no.
p550
aVThey said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.
p551
aVThey said it's worth too much damage
p552
aVto our society to justify the gains.
p553
aVBut what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,
p554
aVthey used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism
p555
aVto start these programs in secret
p556
aVwithout asking Congress,
p557
aVwithout asking the American people,
p558
aVand it's that kind of government behind closed doors
p559
aVthat we need to guard ourselves against,
p560
aVbecause it makes us less safe,
p561
aVand it offers no value.
p562
aa(lp563
VCA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,
p564
aVbecause I've got a more personal question for you.
p565
aVSpeaking of terror,
p566
aVmost people would find the situation you're in right now
p567
aVin Russia pretty terrifying.
p568
aVYou obviously heard what happened,
p569
aVwhat the treatment that Bradley Manning got,
p570
aVChelsea Manning as now is,
p571
aVand there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that
p572
aVthere are people in the intelligence community
p573
aVwho want you dead.
p574
aVHow are you coping with this?
p575
aVHow are you coping with the fear?
p576
aa(lp577
VES: It's no mystery
p578
aVthat there are governments out there that want to see me dead.
p579
aVI've made clear again and again and again
p580
aVthat I go to sleep every morning
p581
aVthinking about what I can do for the American people.
p582
aVI don't want to harm my government.
p583
aVI want to help my government,
p584
aVbut the fact that they are willing to
p585
aVcompletely ignore due process,
p586
aVthey're willing to declare guilt
p587
aVwithout ever seeing a trial,
p588
aVthese are things that we need to work against
p589
aVas a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.
p590
aVWe shouldn't be threatening dissidents.
p591
aVWe shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.
p592
aVAnd whatever part I can do to see that end,
p593
aVI'm happy to do despite the risks.
p594
aa(lp595
VCA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback
p596
aVfrom the audience here,
p597
aVbecause I know there's widely differing reactions
p598
aVto Edward Snowden.
p599
aVSuppose you had the following two choices, right?
p600
aVYou could view what he did
p601
aVas fundamentally a reckless act
p602
aVthat has endangered America
p603
aVor you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act
p604
aVthat will work towards America and the world's
p605
aVlong-term good?
p606
aVThose are the two choices I'll give you.
p607
aVI'm curious to see who's willing to vote with
p608
aVthe first of those,
p609
aVthat this was a reckless act?
p610
aVThere are some hands going up.
p611
aVSome hands going up.
p612
aVIt's hard to put your hand up
p613
aVwhen the man is standing right here,
p614
aVbut I see them.
p615
aa(lp616
VES: I can see you. (Laughter)
p617
aa(lp618
VCA: And who goes with the second choice,
p619
aVthe fundamentally heroic act?
p620
aa(lp621
V(Applause) (Cheers)
p622
aa(lp623
VAnd I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people
p624
aVwho didn't show a hand and I think
p625
aVare still thinking this through,
p626
aVbecause it seems to me that the debate around you
p627
aVdoesn't split along traditional political lines.
p628
aVIt's not left or right, it's not really about
p629
aVpro-government, libertarian, or not just that.
p630
aVPart of it is almost a generational issue.
p631
aVYou're part of a generation that grew up
p632
aVwith the Internet, and it seems as if
p633
aVyou become offended at almost a visceral level
p634
aVwhen you see something done
p635
aVthat you think will harm the Internet.
p636
aVIs there some truth to that?
p637
aa(lp638
VES: It is. I think it's very true.
p639
aVThis is not a left or right issue.
p640
aVOur basic freedoms, and when I say our,
p641
aVI don't just mean Americans,
p642
aVI mean people around the world,
p643
aVit's not a partisan issue.
p644
aVThese are things that all people believe,
p645
aVand it's up to all of us to protect them,
p646
aVand to people who have seen and enjoyed
p647
aVa free and open Internet,
p648
aVit's up to us to preserve that liberty
p649
aVfor the next generation to enjoy,
p650
aVand if we don't change things,
p651
aVif we don't stand up to make the changes
p652
aVwe need to do to keep the Internet safe,
p653
aVnot just for us but for everyone,
p654
aVwe're going to lose that,
p655
aVand that would be a tremendous loss,
p656
aVnot just for us, but for the world.
p657
aa(lp658
VCA: Well, I have heard similar language recently
p659
aVfrom the founder of the world wide web,
p660
aVwho I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
p661
aVTim, actually, would you like to come up and say,
p662
aVdo we have a microphone for Tim?
p663
aa(lp664
V(Applause)
p665
aa(lp666
VTim, good to see you. Come up there.
p667
aVWhich camp are you in, by the way,
p668
aVtraitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but \u2014
p669
aa(lp670
VTim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer
p671
aVanswers to that question, but hero,
p672
aVif I have to make the choice between the two.
p673
aa(lp674
VCA: And Ed, I think you've read
p675
aVthe proposal that Sir Tim has talked about
p676
aVabout a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.
p677
aVIs that something that makes sense?
p678
aVES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up
p679
aVnot just thinking about the Internet,
p680
aVbut I grew up in the Internet,
p681
aVand although I never expected to have the chance
p682
aVto defend it in such a direct and practical manner
p683
aVand to embody it in this unusual,
p684
aValmost avatar manner,
p685
aVI think there's something poetic about the fact that
p686
aVone of the sons of the Internet
p687
aVhas actually become close to the Internet
p688
aVas a result of their political expression.
p689
aVAnd I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet
p690
aVis exactly what we need.
p691
aVWe need to encode our values
p692
aVnot just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,
p693
aVand it's something that I hope,
p694
aVI invite everyone in the audience,
p695
aVnot just here in Vancouver but around the world,
p696
aVto join and participate in.
p697
aa(lp698
VCA: Do you have a question for Ed?
p699
aa(lp700
VTBL: Well, two questions,
p701
aVa general question \u2014
p702
aa(lp703
VCA: Ed, can you still hear us?
p704
aa(lp705
VES: Yes, I can hear you. CA: Oh, he's back.
p706
aa(lp707
VTBL: The wiretap on your line
p708
aVgot a little interfered with for a moment.
p709
aV(Laughter)
p710
aa(lp711
VES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.
p712
aa(lp713
VTBL: So, from the 25 years,
p714
aVstepping back and thinking,
p715
aVwhat would you think would be
p716
aVthe best that we could achieve
p717
aVfrom all the discussions that we have
p718
aVabout the web we want?
p719
aa(lp720
VES: When we think about
p721
aVin terms of how far we can go,
p722
aVI think that's a question that's really only limited
p723
aVby what we're willing to put into it.
p724
aVI think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past
p725
aVhas been exactly what we as not just a nation
p726
aVbut as a people around the world need,
p727
aVand by cooperating, by engaging not just
p728
aVthe technical parts of society,
p729
aVbut as you said, the users,
p730
aVthe people around the world who contribute
p731
aVthrough the Internet, through social media,
p732
aVwho just check the weather,
p733
aVwho rely on it every day as a part of their life,
p734
aVto champion that.
p735
aVWe'll get not just the Internet we've had,
p736
aVbut a better Internet, a better now,
p737
aVsomething that we can use to build a future
p738
aVthat'll be better not just than what we hoped for
p739
aVbut anything that we could have imagined.
p740
aa(lp741
VCA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.
p742
aVA lot of the conversation since then has been
p743
aValong the lines that
p744
aVactually George Orwell got it wrong.
p745
aVIt's not Big Brother watching us.
p746
aVWe, through the power of the web,
p747
aVand transparency, are now watching Big Brother.
p748
aVYour revelations kind of drove a stake
p749
aVthrough the heart of that rather optimistic view,
p750
aVbut you still believe there's a way of doing something
p751
aVabout that.
p752
aVAnd you do too.
p753
aa(lp754
VES: Right, so there is an argument to be made
p755
aVthat the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously.
p756
aVThere was a recent legal article at Yale
p757
aVthat established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle,
p758
aVwhich is that our expectation of privacy is violated
p759
aVwhen the capabilities of government surveillance
p760
aVhave become cheaper by an order of magnitude,
p761
aVand each time that occurs, we need to revisit
p762
aVand rebalance our privacy rights.
p763
aVNow, that hasn't happened since
p764
aVthe government's surveillance powers
p765
aVhave increased by several orders of magnitude,
p766
aVand that's why we're in the problem that we're in today,
p767
aVbut there is still hope,
p768
aVbecause the power of individuals
p769
aVhave also been increased by technology.
p770
aVI am living proof
p771
aVthat an individual can go head to head
p772
aVagainst the most powerful adversaries
p773
aVand the most powerful intelligence agencies
p774
aVaround the world and win,
p775
aVand I think that's something
p776
aVthat we need to take hope from,
p777
aVand we need to build on
p778
aVto make it accessible not just to technical experts
p779
aVbut to ordinary citizens around the world.
p780
aVJournalism is not a crime,
p781
aVcommunication is not a crime,
p782
aVand we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.
p783
aa(lp784
VCA: I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot,
p785
aVbut I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. TBL: That'll come very soon.
p786
aVES: Nice to meet you,
p787
aVand I hope my beam looks as nice
p788
aVas my view of you guys does.
p789
aa(lp790
VCA: Thank you, Tim.
p791
aa(lp792
V(Applause)
p793
aa(lp794
VI mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you.
p795
aVWould you welcome the chance to come back to America?
p796
aa(lp797
VES: Absolutely. There's really no question,
p798
aVthe principles that have been the foundation
p799
aVof this project
p800
aVhave been the public interest
p801
aVand the principles that underly
p802
aVthe journalistic establishment in the United States
p803
aVand around the world,
p804
aVand I think if the press is now saying,
p805
aVwe support this,
p806
aVthis is something that needed to happen,
p807
aVthat's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument,
p808
aVand I think that's something that public should decide.
p809
aVBut at the same time,
p810
aVthe government has hinted that they want
p811
aVsome kind of deal,
p812
aVthat they want me to compromise
p813
aVthe journalists with which I've been working,
p814
aVto come back,
p815
aVand I want to make it very clear
p816
aVthat I did not do this to be safe.
p817
aVI did this to do what was right,
p818
aVand I'm not going to stop my work
p819
aVin the public interest
p820
aVjust to benefit myself.
p821
aV(Applause)
p822
aa(lp823
VCA: In the meantime,
p824
aVcourtesy of the Internet and this technology,
p825
aVyou're here, back in North America,
p826
aVnot quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.
p827
aVI'm curious, how does that feel?
p828
aa(lp829
VES: Canada is different than what I expected.
p830
aVIt's a lot warmer.
p831
aV(Laughter)
p832
aa(lp833
VCA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."
p834
aVIf you could encapsulate it in a single idea,
p835
aVwhat is your idea worth spreading
p836
aVright now at this moment?
p837
aVES: I would say the last year has been a reminder
p838
aVthat democracy may die behind closed doors,
p839
aVbut we as individuals are born
p840
aVbehind those same closed doors,
p841
aVand we don't have to give up
p842
aVour privacy to have good government.
p843
aVWe don't have to give up our liberty
p844
aVto have security.
p845
aVAnd I think by working together
p846
aVwe can have both open government
p847
aVand private lives,
p848
aVand I look forward to working with everyone
p849
aVaround the world to see that happen.
p850
