VI come from one of the most liberal,
p4
aVtolerant, progressive places in the United States,
p5
aVSeattle, Washington.
p6
aVAnd I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.
p7
aVMy mother was an artist, my father was a college professor,
p8
aVand I am truly grateful for my upbringing,
p9
aVbecause I always felt completely comfortable designing my life
p10
aVexactly as I saw fit.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd in point of fact,
p13
aVI took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.
p14
aVWhen I was 19, I dropped out of college \u2014
p15
aVdropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I went on the road as a professional French horn player,
p20
aVwhich was my lifelong dream.
p21
aVI played chamber music all over the United States and Europe,
p22
aVand I toured for a couple of years
p23
aVwith a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.
p24
aVAnd by the end of my 20s,
p25
aVI wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
p26
aVWhat a great life.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd you know, my parents never complained.
p29
aVThey supported me all the way through it.
p30
aVIt wasn't their dream.
p31
aVThey used to tell their neighbors and friends,
p32
aV"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd \u2014
p37
aVThere was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle
p38
aVthat I want to tell you about.
p39
aVI was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,
p40
aVand I was visiting my parents for Christmas,
p41
aVand I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.
p42
aVAnd she was quiet, too quiet.
p43
aVSomething was wrong.
p44
aVAnd so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
p45
aVAnd she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."
p46
aVAnd I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?
p47
aVAnd she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me:
p48
aVhave you been voting for Republicans?"
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, the truth is,
p53
aVI wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.
p54
aVBut I had a bit of an epiphany,
p55
aVand they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.
p56
aVYou see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism,
p57
aVand I want to tell you why that is.
p58
aVIt stems from a lifelong interest of mine
p59
aVin, believe it or not, poverty.
p60
aa(lp61
VSee, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle,
p62
aVI remember the first time I saw real poverty.
p63
aVWe were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.
p64
aVThat's not even close.
p65
aVThe first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face,
p66
aVwas when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.
p67
aVAnd it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.
p68
aVIt was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine
p69
aVof a kid who was my age in East Africa,
p70
aVand there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
p71
aVAnd he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.
p72
aVSome of you remember that picture,
p73
aVnot exactly that picture, one just like it.
p74
aVIt introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.
p75
aVWell, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school
p76
aVand I dropped out and dropped in
p77
aVand started my family.
p78
aVAnd I wondered, what happened to that kid?
p79
aVOr to people just like him all over the world?
p80
aVAnd so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college,
p81
aVI was looking for the answer:
p82
aVwhat happened to the world's poorest people?
p83
aVHas it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd I found the answer, and it changed my life,
p86
aVand I want to share it with you.
p87
aa(lp88
VSee \u2014
p89
aVmost Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse
p90
aVsince we were children, since they saw that vision.
p91
aVIf you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?",
p92
aV70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
p93
aVBut here's the truth.
p94
aVHere's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.
p95
aVFrom 1970 until today,
p96
aVthe percentage of the world's population
p97
aVliving in starvation levels,
p98
aVliving on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation,
p99
aVthat percentage has declined
p100
aVby 80 percent.
p101
aVThere's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty
p102
aVsince I was a kid.
p103
aVAnd I didn't even know about it.
p104
aVThis, my friends, that's a miracle.
p105
aVThat's something we ought to celebrate.
p106
aVIt's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind,
p107
aVand it happened in our lifetimes.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?
p112
aVBecause if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
p113
aVIf you want to replicate it
p114
aVand get the next two billion people out of poverty,
p115
aVbecause that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid,
p116
aVtwo billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters,
p117
aVhave been pulled out of poverty.
p118
aVI want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.
p119
aVAnd I went in search of an answer.
p120
aVAnd it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
p121
aVYou know what, I still don't care.
p122
aVI wanted the best answer from mainstream economists
p123
aVleft, right and center.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd here it is.
p126
aVHere are the reasons.
p127
aVThere are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters
p128
aVhave been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.
p129
aVNumber one: globalization.
p130
aVNumber two: free trade.
p131
aVNumber three: property rights.
p132
aVNumber four: rule of law.
p133
aVNumber five: entrepreneurship.
p134
aVIt was the free enterprise system spreading around the world
p135
aVafter 1970 that did that.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, I'm not naive.
p138
aVI know that free enterprise isn't perfect,
p139
aVand I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need
p140
aVto build a better world.
p141
aVBut that is great.
p142
aVAnd that's beyond politics.
p143
aVHere's what I learned. This is the epiphany.
p144
aVCapitalism is not just about accumulation.
p145
aVAt its best, it's about aspiration,
p146
aVwhich is what so many people on this stage talk about,
p147
aVis the aspiration that comes from dreams
p148
aVthat are embedded in the free enterprise system.
p149
aVAnd we've got to share it with more people.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, I want to tell you about a second epiphany
p152
aVthat's related to that first one
p153
aVthat I think can bring us progress, not just around the world,
p154
aVbut right here at home.
p155
aVThe best quote I've ever heard
p156
aVto summarize the thoughts that I've just given you
p157
aVabout pulling people out of poverty
p158
aVis as follows:
p159
aV"Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
p160
aVThey have lifted billions out of poverty."
p161
aa(lp162
VWho said it?
p163
aVIt sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
p164
aVWrong.
p165
aVPresident Barack Obama said that.
p166
aVWhy do I know it by heart?
p167
aVBecause he said it to me.
p168
aVCrazy.
p169
aVAnd I said, "Hallelujah."
p170
aVBut more than that, I said,
p171
aV"What an opportunity."
p172
aa(lp173
VYou know what I was thinking?
p174
aVIt was at an event that we were doing on the subject
p175
aVat Georgetown University in May of 2015.
p176
aVAnd I thought, this is the solution
p177
aVto the biggest problem facing America today. What?
p178
aVIt's coming together around these ideas,
p179
aVliberals and conservatives,
p180
aVto help people who need us the most.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis,
p183
aVin America and many countries around the world with political polarization.
p184
aVIt's risen to critical, crisis levels.
p185
aVIt's unpleasant. It's not right.
p186
aVThere was an article last year
p187
aVin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
p188
aVwhich is one of the most prestigious scientific journals
p189
aVpublished in the West.
p190
aVAnd it was an article in 2014
p191
aVon political motive asymmetry.
p192
aVWhat's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon
p193
aVof assuming that your ideology is based in love
p194
aVbut your opponents' ideology is based in hate.
p195
aVIt's common in world conflict.
p196
aVYou expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
p197
aVWhat the authors of this article found
p198
aVwas that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats
p199
aVsuffer from political motive asymmetry.
p200
aVA majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe
p201
aVthat they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.
p202
aVThink about it. Think about it.
p203
aVMost people are walking around saying,
p204
aV"You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence,
p205
aVI want to help people,
p206
aVbut the other guys, they're evil and out to get me."
p207
aVYou can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry.
p208
aVIt's impossible.
p209
aa(lp210
VHow do we solve it?
p211
aVWell, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
p212
aVLet's not minimize the differences. That would be really naïve.
p213
aVThere's a lot of good research on this.
p214
aVA veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
p215
aVHe's a psychology professor at New York University.
p216
aVHe does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people
p217
aVto see how they differ.
p218
aVAnd he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals
p219
aVhave a very different emphasis on what they think is important.
p220
aVFor example, Jon Haidt has shown
p221
aVthat liberals care about poverty
p222
aV59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.
p223
aVAnd conservatives care about economic liberty
p224
aV28 percent more than they care about poverty.
p225
aa(lp226
VIrreconcilable differences, right?
p227
aVWe'll never come together. Wrong.
p228
aVThat is diversity in which lies our strength.
p229
aVRemember what pulled up the poor.
p230
aVIt was the obsession with poverty,
p231
aVaccompanied by the method of economic freedom
p232
aVspreading around the world.
p233
aVWe need each other, in other words,
p234
aVif we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.
p235
aVThere's no other way.
p236
aa(lp237
VHmm.
p238
aVHow are we going to get that?
p239
aVIt's a tricky thing, isn't it.
p240
aVWe need innovative thinking.
p241
aVA lot of it's on this stage.
p242
aVSocial entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
p243
aVWe need investment overseas
p244
aVin a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut you know what we really need?
p247
aVWe need a new day in flexible ideology.
p248
aVWe need to be less predictable.
p249
aVDon't we?
p250
aVDo you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable?
p251
aVKinda conventional?
p252
aVDo you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
p253
aVWhy is that dangerous?
p254
aVBecause when we talk in this country about economics,
p255
aVon the right, conservatives,
p256
aVyou're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.
p257
aVAnd on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics,
p258
aVit's always about income inequality.
p259
aVRight? Now those are important things,
p260
aVreally important to me, really important to you.
p261
aVBut when it comes to lifting people up
p262
aVwho are starving and need us today, those are distractions.
p263
aVWe need to come together around the best ways
p264
aVto mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal,
p265
aVand that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals
p266
aVand their obsession with poverty,
p267
aVand liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.
p268
aVThat's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country,
p269
aVif we choose to take it.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
p272
aVI've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me.
p273
aVNumber one. Action item number one:
p274
aVremember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.
p275
aVIt's not good enough.
p276
aVWe have to remember that we need people who disagree with us,
p277
aVbecause there are people who need all of us
p278
aVwho are still waiting for these tools.
p279
aVNow, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?
p280
aVWhere does this start? It starts here.
p281
aVYou know, all of us in this room, we're blessed.
p282
aVWe're blessed with people who listen to us.
p283
aVWe're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership.
p284
aVWhen people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology,
p285
aVthen maybe people will listen.
p286
aVMaybe progress will start at that point.
p287
aVThat's number one. Number two.
p288
aVNumber two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me
p289
aVto be the person specifically who blurs the lines,
p290
aVwho is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.
p291
aVIf you're a conservative,
p292
aVbe the conservative who is always going on about poverty
p293
aVand the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
p294
aVAnd if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking
p295
aVabout the beauty of free markets to solve our problems
p296
aVwhen we use them responsibly.
p297
aa(lp298
VIf we do that, we get two things.
p299
aVNumber one: we get to start to work on the next two billion
p300
aVand be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past
p301
aVand we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.
p302
aVAnd the second is that we might just be able
p303
aVto take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country
p304
aVand turn it into a competition of ideas
p305
aVbased on solidarity and mutual respect.
p306
aVAnd then maybe, just maybe,
p307
aVwe'll all realize that our big differences
p308
aVaren't really that big after all.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
