VChris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.
p4
aVYour software, Linux, is in millions of computers,
p5
aVit probably powers much of the Internet.
p6
aVAnd I think that there are, like,
p7
aVa billion and a half active Android devices out there.
p8
aVYour software is in every single one of them.
p9
aVIt's kind of amazing.
p10
aVYou must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.
p11
aVThat's what I thought \u2014 and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.
p12
aVI mean, this is \u2014
p13
aVthis is the Linux world headquarters.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
V(Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VLinus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.
p20
aVAnd I have to say,
p21
aVthe most interesting part in this picture,
p22
aVthat people mostly react to,
p23
aVis the walking desk.
p24
aVIt is the most interesting part in my office
p25
aVand I'm not actually using it anymore.
p26
aVAnd I think the two things are related.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe way I work is ...
p29
aVI want to not have external stimulation.
p30
aVYou can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.
p31
aVI'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's like a calming color,
p36
aVit's not something that really stimulates you.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhat you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen,
p39
aVbut the main thing I worry about in my computer is \u2014
p40
aVit doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that \u2014
p41
aVit really has to be completely silent.
p42
aVI know people who work for Google
p43
aVand they have their own small data center at home,
p44
aVand I don't do that.
p45
aVMy office is the most boring office you'll ever see.
p46
aVAnd I sit there alone in the quiet.
p47
aVIf the cat comes up,
p48
aVit sits in my lap.
p49
aVAnd I want to hear the cat purring,
p50
aVnot the sound of the fans in the computer.
p51
aa(lp52
VCA: So this is astonishing,
p53
aVbecause working this way,
p54
aVyou're able to run this vast technology empire \u2014
p55
aVit is an empire \u2014
p56
aVso that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.
p57
aa(lp58
VTell us how you got to understand open source
p59
aVand how it lead to the development of Linux.
p60
aa(lp61
VLT: I mean, I still work alone.
p62
aVReally \u2014 I work alone in my house,
p63
aVoften in my bathrobe.
p64
aVWhen a photographer shows up, I dress up,
p65
aVso I have clothes on.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd that's how I've always worked.
p70
aVI mean, this was how I started Linux, too.
p71
aVI did not start Linux as a collaborative project.
p72
aVI started it as one in a series of many projects
p73
aVI had done at the time for myself,
p74
aVpartly because I needed the end result,
p75
aVbut even more because I just enjoyed programming.
p76
aVSo it was about the end of the journey,
p77
aVwhich, 25 years later, we still have not reached.
p78
aVBut it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own
p79
aVand there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd what happened is ...
p82
aVthe project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.
p83
aVReally, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!"
p84
aVAnd trust me \u2014 it was not that great back then.
p85
aVI made it publicly available,
p86
aVand it wasn't even open source at that point.
p87
aVAt that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention
p88
aVbehind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today
p89
aVto improve it.
p90
aVIt was more like,
p91
aV"Look, I've been working on this for half a year,
p92
aVI'd love to have comments."
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd other people approached me.
p95
aVAt the University of Helsinki,
p96
aVI had a friend who was one of the open source \u2014
p97
aVit was called mainly "free software" back then \u2014
p98
aVand he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey,
p99
aVyou can use these open-source licenses that had been around.
p100
aVAnd I thought about it for a while.
p101
aVI was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.
p102
aVI mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have,
p103
aVis that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?
p104
aVAnd I decided, "What the hell?"
p105
aVAnd \u2014
p106
aa(lp107
VCA: And then at some point,
p108
aVsomeone contributed some code that you thought,
p109
aV"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.
p110
aVThis could actually improve this."
p111
aa(lp112
VLT: It didn't even start by people contributing code,
p113
aVit was more that people started contributing ideas.
p114
aVAnd just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project \u2014
p115
aVand I'm sure it's true of other things, too,
p116
aVbut it's definitely true in code \u2014
p117
aVis that somebody else takes an interest in your code,
p118
aVlooks at it enough to actually give you feedback
p119
aVand give you ideas.
p120
aVThat was a huge thing for me.
p121
aa(lp122
VI was 21 at the time, so I was young,
p123
aVbut I had already programmed for half my life, basically.
p124
aVAnd every project before that had been completely personal
p125
aVand it was a revelation when people just started commenting,
p126
aVstarted giving feedback on your code.
p127
aVAnd even before they started giving code back,
p128
aVthat was, I think, one of the big moments where I said,
p129
aV"I love other people!"
p130
aVDon't get me wrong \u2014
p131
aVI'm actually not a people person.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VI don't really love other people \u2014
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VBut I love computers,
p140
aVI love interacting with other people on email,
p141
aVbecause it kind of gives you that buffer.
p142
aVBut I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.
p143
aVAnd it made it so much more.
p144
aa(lp145
VCA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built
p146
aVand it suddenly started taking off,
p147
aVand you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge,
p148
aVnot just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on,
p149
aVbut a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?
p150
aa(lp151
VLT: Not really.
p152
aVI mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge,
p153
aVit was when it was becoming little.
p154
aVThe big point for me was not being alone
p155
aVand having 10, maybe 100 people being involved \u2014
p156
aVthat was a big point.
p157
aVThen everything else was very gradual.
p158
aVGoing from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal \u2014 to me.
p159
aVWell, I mean, maybe it is if you're \u2014
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VIf you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal \u2014
p164
aVdon't get me wrong.
p165
aVBut if you're interested in the technology
p166
aVand you're interested in the project,
p167
aVthe big part was getting the community.
p168
aVThen the community grew gradually.
p169
aVAnd there's actually not a single point where I went like,
p170
aV"Wow, that just took off!" because it \u2014
p171
aVI mean \u2014 it took a long time, relatively.
p172
aa(lp173
VCA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you
p174
aVwith massively changing their work.
p175
aVAnd it's not just Linux,
p176
aVit's this thing called Git,
p177
aVwhich is this management system for software development.
p178
aVTell us briefly about that and your role in that.
p179
aa(lp180
VLT: So one of the issues we had,
p181
aVand this took a while to start to appear,
p182
aVis when you ...
p183
aVWhen you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project
p184
aVto having 10,000 people, which \u2014
p185
aVI mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel,
p186
aVwe have 1,000 people involved in every single release
p187
aVand that's every two months, roughly two or three months.
p188
aVSome of those people don't do a lot.
p189
aVThere's a lot of people who make small, small changes.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut to maintain this,
p192
aVthe scale changes how you have to maintain it.
p193
aVAnd we went through a lot of pain.
p194
aVAnd there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.
p195
aVCVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used,
p196
aVand I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it
p197
aVand tried something else that was radical and interesting
p198
aVand everybody else hated.
p199
aa(lp200
VCA: (Laughs)
p201
aa(lp202
VLT: And we were in this bad spot,
p203
aVwhere we had thousands of people who wanted to participate,
p204
aVbut in many ways, I was the kind of break point,
p205
aVwhere I could not scale to the point
p206
aVwhere I could work with thousands of people.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo Git is my second big project,
p209
aVwhich was only created for me to maintain my first big project.
p210
aVAnd this is literally how I work.
p211
aVI don't code for \u2014
p212
aVwell, I do code for fun \u2014
p213
aVbut I want to code for something meaningful
p214
aVso every single project I've ever done has been something I needed
p215
aVand \u2014
p216
aa(lp217
VCA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose
p218
aValmost as an unintended consequence
p219
aVof your desire not to have to work with too many people.
p220
aa(lp221
VLT: Absolutely. Yes.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VCA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd yet, you're the man who's transformed technology
p230
aVnot just once but twice,
p231
aVand we have to try and understand why it is.
p232
aVYou've given us some clues, but ...
p233
aVHere's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.
p234
aVYou mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11,
p235
aVhalf your life.
p236
aa(lp237
VWere you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd,
p238
aVwere you the star at school who could do everything?
p239
aVWhat were you like as a kid?
p240
aa(lp241
VLT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.
p242
aVI mean, I was ...
p243
aVI was not a people person back then.
p244
aVThat's my younger brother.
p245
aVI was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube
p246
aVthan my younger brother.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VMy younger sister, who's not in the picture,
p251
aVwhen we had family meetings \u2014
p252
aVand it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins \u2014
p253
aVshe would prep me beforehand.
p254
aVLike, before I stepped into the room she would say,
p255
aV"OK. That's so-and-so ..."
p256
aVBecause I was not \u2014
p257
aVI was a geek.
p258
aVI was into computers,
p259
aVI was into math,
p260
aVI was into physics.
p261
aVI was good at that.
p262
aVI don't think I was particularly exceptional.
p263
aVApparently, my sister said
p264
aVthat my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.
p265
aa(lp266
VCA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.
p267
aVYou would not let go.
p268
aVSo that's not about being a geek and being smart,
p269
aVthat's about being ... stubborn?
p270
aa(lp271
VLT: That's about being stubborn.
p272
aVThat's about, like,
p273
aVjust starting something
p274
aVand not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else \u2014
p275
aVLook: shiny!"
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.
p278
aVI lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.
p279
aVAnd I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley,
p280
aVfor the whole time.
p281
aVThat is unheard of.
p282
aVThat's not how Silicon Valley works.
p283
aVThe whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs
p284
aVto kind of mix up the pot.
p285
aVAnd that's not the kind of person I am.
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: But during the actual development of Linux itself,
p288
aVthat stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.
p289
aVTalk about that a bit.
p290
aVWas that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?
p291
aVHow would you describe what happened?
p292
aa(lp293
VLT: I don't know if it's essential.
p294
aVGoing back to the "I'm not a people person," \u2014
p295
aVsometimes I'm also ...
p296
aVshall we say,
p297
aV"myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings,
p298
aVand that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.
p299
aVAnd I'm not proud of that.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VBut, at the same time, it's \u2014
p304
aVI get people who tell me that I should be nice.
p305
aVAnd then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice,
p306
aVmaybe you should be more aggressive,
p307
aVthey see that as me being not nice.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VWhat I'm trying to say is we are different.
p312
aVI'm not a people person;
p313
aVit's not something I'm particularly proud of,
p314
aVbut it's part of me.
p315
aVAnd one of the things I really like about open source
p316
aVis it really allows different people to work together.
p317
aVWe don't have to like each other \u2014
p318
aVand sometimes we really don't like each other.
p319
aVReally \u2014 I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.
p320
aVBut you can, actually, you can find things that \u2014
p321
aVyou don't even agree to disagree,
p322
aVit's just that you're interested in really different things.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd coming back to the point where I said earlier
p325
aVthat I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work,
p326
aVit turned out, and very quickly turned out,
p327
aVthat those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.
p328
aVAnd they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing,
p329
aVand they had completely different goals.
p330
aVAnd they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.
p331
aVBut because it was open source they could do it,
p332
aVand it actually works really beautifully together.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd I actually think it works the same way.
p335
aVYou need to have the people-people, the communicators,
p336
aVthe warm and friendly people
p337
aVwho like \u2014
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
Vreally want to hug you and get you into the community.
p342
aVBut that's not everybody.
p343
aVAnd that's not me.
p344
aVI care about the technology.
p345
aVThere are people who care about the UI.
p346
aVI can't do UI to save my life.
p347
aVI mean, if I was stranded on an island
p348
aVand the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI,
p349
aVI'd die there.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VSo there's different kinds of people,
p354
aVand I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.
p355
aa(lp356
VCA: Now, when we talked last week,
p357
aVyou talked about some other trait that you have,
p358
aVwhich I found really interesting.
p359
aVIt's this idea called taste.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd I've just got a couple of images here.
p362
aVI think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code,
p363
aVand this one is better taste,
p364
aVwhich one can immediately see.
p365
aVWhat is the difference between these two?
p366
aa(lp367
VLT: So this is \u2014
p368
aVHow many people here actually have coded?
p369
aa(lp370
VCA: Oh my goodness.
p371
aa(lp372
VLT: So I guarantee you,
p373
aVeverybody who raised their hand,
p374
aVthey have done what's called a singly-linked list.
p375
aVAnd it's taught \u2014
p376
aVThis, the first not very good taste approach,
p377
aVis basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.
p378
aVAnd you don't have to understand the code.
p379
aa(lp380
VThe most interesting part to me
p381
aVis the last if statement.
p382
aVBecause what happens in a singly-linked list \u2014
p383
aVthis is trying to remove an existing entry from a list \u2014
p384
aVand there's a difference between if it's the first entry
p385
aVor whether it's an entry in the middle.
p386
aVBecause if it's the first entry,
p387
aVyou have to change the pointer to the first entry.
p388
aVIf it's in the middle,
p389
aVyou have to change the pointer of a previous entry.
p390
aVSo they're two completely different cases.
p391
aa(lp392
VCA: And that's better.
p393
aa(lp394
VLT: And this is better.
p395
aVIt does not have the if statement.
p396
aVAnd it doesn't really matter \u2014
p397
aVI don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement,
p398
aVbut I want you to understand
p399
aVthat sometimes you can see a problem in a different way
p400
aVand rewrite it so that a special case goes away
p401
aVand becomes the normal case.
p402
aVAnd that's good code.
p403
aVBut this is simple code.
p404
aVThis is CS 101.
p405
aVThis is not important \u2014 although, details are important.
p406
aa(lp407
VTo me, the sign of people I really want to work with
p408
aVis that they have good taste, which is how ...
p409
aVI sent you this stupid example
p410
aVthat is not relevant because it's too small.
p411
aVGood taste is much bigger than this.
p412
aVGood taste is about really seeing the big patterns
p413
aVand kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.
p414
aa(lp415
VCA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.
p416
aVYou have taste,
p417
aVin a way that's meaningful to software people.
p418
aVYou're \u2014
p419
aa(lp420
V(Laughter)
p421
aa(lp422
VLT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.
p423
aa(lp424
VCA: You're a very smart computer coder,
p425
aVand you're hellish stubborn.
p426
aVBut there must be something else.
p427
aVI mean, you've changed the future.
p428
aVYou must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.
p429
aVYou're a visionary, right?
p430
aa(lp431
VLT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED
p432
aVfor the last two days,
p433
aVbecause there's a lot of vision going on, right?
p434
aVAnd I am not a visionary.
p435
aVI do not have a five-year plan.
p436
aVI'm an engineer.
p437
aVAnd I think it's really \u2014
p438
aVI mean \u2014 I'm perfectly happy with all the people
p439
aVwho are walking around and just staring at the clouds
p440
aVand looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there."
p441
aVBut I'm looking at the ground,
p442
aVand I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me
p443
aVbefore I fall in.
p444
aVThis is the kind of person I am.
p445
aa(lp446
V(Cheers)
p447
aa(lp448
V(Applause)
p449
aa(lp450
VCA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.
p451
aVWho are they and how do you relate to them?
p452
aa(lp453
VLT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology,
p454
aVthe whole Tesla versus Edison,
p455
aVwhere Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.
p456
aVAnd people love Tesla.
p457
aVI mean, there are people who name their companies after him.
p458
aa(lp459
V(Laughter)
p460
aa(lp461
VThe other person there is Edison,
p462
aVwho is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian
p463
aVand is \u2014
p464
aVI mean, his most famous quote is,
p465
aV"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."
p466
aVAnd I'm in the Edison camp,
p467
aVeven if people don't always like him.
p468
aVBecause if you actually compare the two,
p469
aVTesla has kind of this mind grab these days,
p470
aVbut who actually changed the world?
p471
aVEdison may not have been a nice person,
p472
aVhe did a lot of things \u2014
p473
aVhe was maybe not so intellectual,
p474
aVnot so visionary.
p475
aVBut I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.
p476
aa(lp477
VCA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams \u2014
p478
aVbig, bold, audacious dreams.
p479
aVYou're really the antidote to that.
p480
aa(lp481
VLT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.
p482
aa(lp483
VCA: That's good.
p484
aa(lp485
V(Laughter)
p486
aVWe embrace you, we embrace you.
p487
aa(lp488
VCompanies like Google and many others have made, arguably,
p489
aVlike, billions of dollars out of your software.
p490
aVDoes that piss you off?
p491
aa(lp492
VLT: No.
p493
aVNo, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.
p494
aVAnd one of them is, I'm doing fine.
p495
aVI'm really doing fine.
p496
aa(lp497
VBut the other reason is \u2014
p498
aVI mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing,
p499
aVLinux would never have been what it is.
p500
aVAnd it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking,
p501
aVbut at the same time, this is an experience.
p502
aVTrust me.
p503
aVSo there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man
p504
aVand thinking I did the right choices.
p505
aa(lp506
VCA: Is the open source idea \u2014
p507
aVthis is, I think we'll end here \u2014
p508
aVis the open source idea fully realized now in the world,
p509
aVor is there more that it could go,
p510
aVare there more things that it could do?
p511
aa(lp512
VLT: So, I'm of two minds there.
p513
aVI think one reason open source works so well in code
p514
aVis that at the end of the day,
p515
aVcode tends to be somewhat black and white.
p516
aVThere's often a fairly good way to decide,
p517
aVthis is done correctly and this is not done well.
p518
aVCode either works or it doesn't,
p519
aVwhich means that there's less room for arguments.
p520
aVAnd we have arguments despite this, right?
p521
aVIn many other areas \u2014
p522
aVI mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that \u2014
p523
aVand it's really hard sometimes to say
p524
aVthat, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas
p525
aVjust because the black and white turns into not just gray,
p526
aVbut different colors.
p527
aa(lp528
VSo, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.
p529
aVScience was there first.
p530
aVBut then science ended up being pretty closed,
p531
aVwith very expensive journals and some of that going on.
p532
aVAnd open source is making a comeback in science,
p533
aVwith things like arXiv and open journals.
p534
aVWikipedia changed the world, too.
p535
aVSo there are other examples,
p536
aVI'm sure there are more to come.
p537
aa(lp538
VCA: But you're not a visionary,
p539
aVand so it's not up to you to name them.
p540
aa(lp541
VLT: No.
p542
aa(lp543
V(Laughter)
p544
aa(lp545
VIt's up to you guys to make them, right?
p546
aa(lp547
VCA: Exactly.
p548
aa(lp549
VLinus Torvalds,
p550
aVthank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet,
p551
aVthank you for all those Android phones.
