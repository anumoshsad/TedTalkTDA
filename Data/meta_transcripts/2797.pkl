VImagine that when you walked in here this evening,
p4
aVyou discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same:
p5
aVageless, raceless,
p6
aVgenerically good-looking.
p7
aVThat person sitting right next to you
p8
aVmight have the most idiosyncratic inner life,
p9
aVbut you don't have a clue
p10
aVbecause we're all wearing the same blank expression all the time.
p11
aVThat is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities,
p12
aVonly it applies to buildings, not people.
p13
aa(lp14
VCities are full of roughness and shadow,
p15
aVtexture and color.
p16
aVYou can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character
p17
aVin apartment buildings in Riga
p18
aVand Yemen,
p19
aVsocial housing in Vienna,
p20
aVHopi villages in Arizona,
p21
aVbrownstones in New York,
p22
aVwooden houses in San Francisco.
p23
aVThese aren't palaces or cathedrals.
p24
aVThese are just ordinary residences
p25
aVexpressing the ordinary splendor of cities.
p26
aVAnd the reason they're like that is that the need for shelter
p27
aVis so bound up with the human desire for beauty.
p28
aVTheir rough surfaces give us a touchable city.
p29
aVRight? Streets that you can read
p30
aVby running your fingers over brick and stone.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut that's getting harder to do,
p33
aVbecause cities are becoming smooth.
p34
aVNew downtowns sprout towers
p35
aVthat are almost always made of concrete and steel
p36
aVand covered in glass.
p37
aVYou can look at skylines all over the world \u2014
p38
aVHouston,
p39
aVGuangzhou,
p40
aVFrankfurt \u2014
p41
aVand you see the same army of high-gloss robots
p42
aVmarching over the horizon.
p43
aVNow, just think of everything we lose
p44
aVwhen architects stop using the full range of available materials.
p45
aVWhen we reject granite and limestone and sandstone
p46
aVand wood and copper and terra-cotta and brick
p47
aVand wattle and plaster,
p48
aVwe simplify architecture
p49
aVand we impoverish cities.
p50
aVIt's as if you reduced all of the world's cuisines
p51
aVdown to airline food.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VChicken or pasta?
p56
aa(lp57
VBut worse still,
p58
aVassemblies of glass towers like this one in Moscow
p59
aVsuggest a disdain for the civic and communal aspects of urban living.
p60
aVRight? Buildings like these are intended to enrich their owners and tenants,
p61
aVbut not necessarily the lives of the rest of us,
p62
aVthose of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings.
p63
aVAnd we expect to do so for free.
p64
aVShiny towers are an invasive species
p65
aVand they are choking our cities and killing off public space.
p66
aVWe tend to think of a facade as being like makeup,
p67
aVa decorative layer applied at the end to a building that's effectively complete.
p68
aVBut just because a facade is superficial
p69
aVdoesn't mean it's not also deep.
p70
aa(lp71
VLet me give you an example
p72
aVof how a city's surfaces affect the way we live in it.
p73
aVWhen I visited Salamanca in Spain,
p74
aVI gravitated to the Plaza Mayor
p75
aVat all hours of the day.
p76
aVEarly in the morning, sunlight rakes the facades,
p77
aVsharpening shadows,
p78
aVand at night, lamplight segments the buildings
p79
aVinto hundreds of distinct areas,
p80
aVbalconies and windows and arcades,
p81
aVeach one a separate pocket of visual activity.
p82
aVThat detail and depth, that glamour
p83
aVgives the plaza a theatrical quality.
p84
aVIt becomes a stage where the generations can meet.
p85
aVYou have teenagers sprawling on the pavers,
p86
aVseniors monopolizing the benches,
p87
aVand real life starts to look like an opera set.
p88
aVThe curtain goes up on Salamanca.
p89
aVSo just because I'm talking about the exteriors of buildings,
p90
aVnot form, not function, not structure,
p91
aVeven so those surfaces give texture to our lives,
p92
aVbecause buildings create the spaces around them,
p93
aVand those spaces can draw people in
p94
aVor push them away.
p95
aVAnd the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo one contemporary equivalent of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca
p98
aVis the Place de la Défense in Paris,
p99
aVa windswept, glass-walled open space
p100
aVthat office workers hurry through
p101
aVon the way from the metro to their cubicles
p102
aVbut otherwise spend as little time in as possible.
p103
aVIn the early 1980s, the architect Philip Johnson
p104
aVtried to recreate a gracious European plaza in Pittsburgh.
p105
aVThis is PPG Place,
p106
aVa half acre of open space encircled by commercial buildings
p107
aVmade of mirrored glass.
p108
aVAnd he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays
p109
aVand Gothic turrets
p110
aVwhich really pop on the skyline.
p111
aVBut at ground level,
p112
aVthe plaza feels like a black glass cage.
p113
aVI mean, sure, in summertime
p114
aVkids are running back and forth through the fountain
p115
aVand there's ice-skating in the winter,
p116
aVbut it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout.
p117
aVIt's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat.
p118
aa(lp119
VPublic spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons.
p120
aVArchitecture is only one,
p121
aVbut it's an important one.
p122
aVSome recent plazas
p123
aVlike Federation Square in Melbourne
p124
aVor Superkilen in Copenhagen
p125
aVsucceed because they combine old and new,
p126
aVrough and smooth,
p127
aVneutral and bright colors,
p128
aVand because they don't rely excessively on glass.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, I'm not against glass.
p131
aVIt's an ancient and versatile material.
p132
aVIt's easy to manufacture and transport
p133
aVand install and replace
p134
aVand clean.
p135
aVIt comes in everything from enormous, ultraclear sheets
p136
aVto translucent bricks.
p137
aVNew coatings make it change mood
p138
aVin the shifting light.
p139
aVIn expensive cities like New York, it has the magical power
p140
aVof being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views,
p141
aVwhich is really the only commodity that developers have to offer
p142
aVto justify those surreal prices.
p143
aa(lp144
VIn the middle of the 19th century,
p145
aVwith the construction of the Crystal Palace in London,
p146
aVglass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances.
p147
aVBy the mid-20th century,
p148
aVit had come to dominate the downtowns of some American cities,
p149
aVlargely through some really spectacular office buildings
p150
aVlike Lever House in midtown Manhattan, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
p151
aVEventually, the technology advanced to the point
p152
aVwhere architects could design structures so transparent
p153
aVthey practically disappear.
p154
aVAnd along the way,
p155
aVglass became the default material of the high-rise city,
p156
aVand there's a very powerful reason for that.
p157
aVBecause as the world's populations converge on cities,
p158
aVthe least fortunate pack into jerry-built shantytowns.
p159
aVBut hundreds of millions of people need apartments and places to work
p160
aVin ever-larger buildings,
p161
aVso it makes economic sense to put up towers
p162
aVand wrap them in cheap and practical curtain walls.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut glass has a limited ability
p165
aVto be expressive.
p166
aVThis is a section of wall framing a plaza
p167
aVin the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla, in southern Mexico.
p168
aVThose 2,000-year-old carvings
p169
aVmake it clear that this was a place of high ritual significance.
p170
aVToday we look at those and we can see a historical and textural continuity
p171
aVbetween those carvings, the mountains all around
p172
aVand that church which is built on top of the ruins
p173
aVusing stone plundered from the site.
p174
aVIn nearby Oaxaca, even ordinary plaster buildings
p175
aVbecome canvasses for bright colors, political murals
p176
aVand sophisticated graphic arts.
p177
aVIt's an intricate, communicative language
p178
aVthat an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out.
p179
aa(lp180
VThe good news is that architects and developers
p181
aVhave begun to rediscover the joys of texture
p182
aVwithout backing away from modernity.
p183
aVSome find innovative uses for old materials like brick
p184
aVand terra-cotta.
p185
aVOthers invent new products like the molded panels that Snøhetta used
p186
aVto give the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
p187
aVthat crinkly, sculptural quality.
p188
aVThe architect Stefano Boeri even created living facades.
p189
aVThis is his Vertical Forest, a pair of apartment towers in Milan,
p190
aVwhose most visible feature is greenery.
p191
aVAnd Boeri is designing a version of this for Nanjing in China.
p192
aVAnd imagine if green facades were as ubiquitous as glass ones
p193
aVhow much cleaner the air in Chinese cities would become.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut the truth is that these are mostly one-offs,
p196
aVboutique projects,
p197
aVnot easily reproduced at a global scale.
p198
aVAnd that is the point.
p199
aVWhen you use materials that have a local significance,
p200
aVyou prevent cities from all looking the same.
p201
aVCopper has a long history in New York \u2014
p202
aVthe Statue of Liberty,
p203
aVthe crown of the Woolworth Building \u2014
p204
aVbut it fell out of fashion for a long time
p205
aVuntil SHoP Architects used it to cover the American Copper Building,
p206
aVa pair of twisting towers on the East River.
p207
aVIt's not even finished
p208
aVand you can see the way sunset lights up that metallic facade,
p209
aVwhich will weather to green as it ages.
p210
aa(lp211
VBuildings can be like people.
p212
aVTheir faces broadcast their experience.
p213
aVAnd that's an important point,
p214
aVbecause when glass ages,
p215
aVyou just replace it,
p216
aVand the building looks pretty much the same way it did before
p217
aVuntil eventually it's demolished.
p218
aVAlmost all other materials have the ability
p219
aVto absorb infusions of history and memory,
p220
aVand project it into the present.
p221
aVThe firm Ennead
p222
aVclad the Utah Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,
p223
aVores that have been mined in the area for 150 years
p224
aVand that also camouflage the building against the ochre hills
p225
aVso that you have a natural history museum
p226
aVthat reflects the region's natural history.
p227
aVAnd when the Chinese Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu
p228
aVwas building a history museum in Ningbo,
p229
aVhe didn't just create a wrapper for the past,
p230
aVhe built memory right into the walls
p231
aVby using brick and stones and shingles
p232
aVsalvaged from villages that had been demolished.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, architects can use glass
p235
aVin equally lyrical and inventive ways.
p236
aVHere in New York, two buildings,
p237
aVone by Jean Nouvel and this one by Frank Gehry
p238
aVface off across West 19th Street,
p239
aVand the play of reflections that they toss back and forth
p240
aVis like a symphony in light.
p241
aVBut when a city defaults to glass
p242
aVas it grows,
p243
aVit becomes a hall of mirrors,
p244
aVdisquieting and cold.
p245
aVAfter all, cities are places of concentrated variety
p246
aVwhere the world's cultures and languages and lifestyles
p247
aVcome together and mingle.
p248
aVSo rather than encase all that variety
p249
aVand diversity in buildings of crushing sameness,
p250
aVwe should have an architecture that honors the full range of the urban experience.
