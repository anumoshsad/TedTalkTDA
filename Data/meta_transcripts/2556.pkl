VSo when I decided to create an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,
p4
aVthe neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt,
p5
aVI never thought this project would be
p6
aVthe most amazing human experience that I would ever live.
p7
aVAs an artist, I had this humanist intention
p8
aVof beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood
p9
aVby bringing art to it and hopefully shining light on this isolated community.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe first time I heard about this Christian Coptic community
p12
aVwas in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Hosni Mubarak
p13
aVdecided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of H1N1 virus.
p14
aVOriginally, they are pig breeders.
p15
aVTheir pigs and other animals are fed with the organic waste
p16
aVthat they collect on a daily basis.
p17
aVThis event killed their livelihood.
p18
aVThe first time I entered Manshiyat Naser, it felt like a maze.
p19
aVI was looking for the St. Simon Monastery on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.
p20
aVSo you go right, then straight, then right again, then left
p21
aVto reach all the way to the top.
p22
aVBut to reach there, you must dodge between the trucks overpacked with garbage
p23
aVand slalom between the tuk-tuks,
p24
aVthe fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood.
p25
aVThe smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense,
p26
aVand the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing.
p27
aVAdd to it the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way.
p28
aVFrom outside it looks chaotic, but everything is perfectly organized.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe Zaraeeb, that\u2019s how they call themselves,
p31
aVwhich means the pig breeders,
p32
aVhave been collecting the garbage of Cairo
p33
aVand sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades.
p34
aVThey have developed one of the most efficient
p35
aVand highly profitable systems on a global level.
p36
aVStill, the place is perceived as dirty, marginalized and segregated
p37
aVbecause of their association with the trash.
p38
aVSo my initial idea was to create an anamorphic piece,
p39
aVa piece that you can only see from one vantage point.
p40
aVI wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings
p41
aVand having it only fully visible from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.
p42
aVThe Muqattam Mountain is the pride of the community.
p43
aVThis is where they built the St. Simon Monastery,
p44
aVa 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, the first time I stood on top of the mountain
p47
aVand I looked at the neighborhood,
p48
aVI asked myself, how on earth will I convince all those owners
p49
aVto let me paint on their buildings?
p50
aVAnd then Magd came.
p51
aVMagd is a guide from the Church.
p52
aVHe told me the only person I needed to convince was Father Samaan,
p53
aVwho is the leader of the community.
p54
aVBut to convince Father Samaan, I needed to convince Mario,
p55
aVwho is a Polish artist who moved to Cairo 20 years ago
p56
aVand who created all the artwork of the Cave Church.
p57
aVI am really grateful to Mario. He was the key of the project.
p58
aVHe managed to get me a meeting with Father Samaan,
p59
aVand surprisingly, he loved the idea.
p60
aVHe asked me about where I painted before
p61
aVand how I will make it happen.
p62
aVAnd he was mainly concerned by what I was going to write.
p63
aa(lp64
VIn every work that I create, I write messages
p65
aVwith my style of Arabic calligraphy.
p66
aVI make sure those messages are relevant to the place where I am painting
p67
aVbut have this universal dimension,
p68
aVso anybody around the world can relate to it.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo for Manshiyat Naser,
p71
aVI decided to write in Arabic the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,
p72
aVa Coptic bishop from the third century,
p73
aVwho said: (Arabic),
p74
aVwhich means in English,
p75
aV"Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly
p76
aVneeds to wipe his eyes first."
p77
aa(lp78
VIt was really important for me
p79
aVthat the community felt connected to the words.
p80
aVAnd for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo Father Samaan blessed the project,
p83
aVand his approval brought all the residents on board.
p84
aVHundreds of liters of paint, a dozen blue manual lifts,
p85
aVseveral trips back and forth to Cairo,
p86
aVa strong and solid team from France, North Africa, Middle East and the US,
p87
aVand after a year of planning and logistics, there we are,
p88
aVmy team and some members from the local community
p89
aVcreating a piece that will spread over 50 buildings,
p90
aVsome filling up the space of the calligraphy
p91
aVthat I trace with colors.
p92
aVHere some blue, there some yellow, there some orange.
p93
aVSome others carrying some sand bags
p94
aVand putting them on the top of the buildings
p95
aVto hold those manual lifts,
p96
aVand some others assembling and disassembling those same lifts
p97
aVand moving them around the different buildings.
p98
aa(lp99
VAt the beginning of the project,
p100
aVI numbered all those buildings on my sketch,
p101
aVand there was no real interaction with the community.
p102
aVPeople didn\u2019t get the point of all this.
p103
aVBut fast enough, those building numbers became family names.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe first building was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.
p106
aVUncle Ibrahim is such an enthusiastic person.
p107
aVHe was always singing and making jokes,
p108
aVand his daughters and sons saved me from his bull
p109
aVwho wanted to attack me on the fourth floor.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VActually, the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VYeah.
p118
aa(lp119
VUncle Ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony
p120
aVand talking to me while I was painting.
p121
aVI remember him saying that he didn\u2019t go to the mountain for 10 years,
p122
aVand that he never takes a day off.
p123
aVHe said that if he stopped working, who will stop the garbage?
p124
aVBut surprisingly, at the end of the project,
p125
aVhe came all the way to the mountain to look at the piece.
p126
aVHe was really proud to see his house painted,
p127
aVand he said that this project was a project of peace and \u2014
p128
aVsorry \u2014
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VThank you.
p133
aa(lp134
VHe said that it was a project of peace and unity
p135
aVand that it brought people together.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo his perception towards the project changed,
p138
aVand my perception towards the community changed also,
p139
aVand towards what they do.
p140
aVAll the garbage that everybody is disgusted by is not theirs.
p141
aVThey just work out of it.
p142
aVActually, they don\u2019t live in the garbage. They live from the garbage.
p143
aVSo I started doubting myself and wondering
p144
aVwhat was the real purpose of this whole project?
p145
aVIt was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it.
p146
aVIt was about switching perception and opening a dialogue
p147
aVon the connection that we have with communities that we don\u2019t know.
p148
aVSo day after day,
p149
aVthe calligraphy circle was taking shape,
p150
aVand we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece.
p151
aVAnd standing exactly at this point every day made my realize
p152
aVthe symbolism behind this anamorphic piece.
p153
aVIf you want to see the real image of somebody,
p154
aVmaybe you should change your angle.
p155
aa(lp156
VThere was doubts and difficulties,
p157
aVlike fears and stress.
p158
aVIt wasn't simple to work in such environments,
p159
aVsometimes having pigs under you while you paint
p160
aVor climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift.
p161
aVBut we all got over the fear of the heights, the swinging lifts,
p162
aVthe strength of the smell
p163
aVand also the stress of not finishing on time.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut the kindness of all those people made us forget everything.
p166
aVThe building number 3 was the house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.
p167
aVIn Egyptian, they have this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"
p168
aVwhich means "the best people."
p169
aVThey were the best people.
p170
aVWe used to take our break in front of their houses,
p171
aVand all the kids of the neighborhood
p172
aVused to join us.
p173
aVI was impressed and amazed by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.
p174
aVFor the first few days, they were always refusing anything we were offering them,
p175
aVeven a snack or a drink.
p176
aVSo I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"
p177
aVAnd she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything
p178
aVfrom somebody that they don't know
p179
aVbecause maybe this person needs it more than they do.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo at this exact point I realized actually
p182
aVthe Zaraeeb community was the ideal context
p183
aVto raise the topic of perception.
p184
aVWe need to question our level of misconception
p185
aVand judgment we can have as a society
p186
aVupon communities based on their differences.
p187
aVI remember how we got delayed on Uncle Ibrahim's house
p188
aVwhen his pigs that are bred on the rooftop
p189
aVwere eating the sand bags that hold the lifts.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VThe house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda
p194
aVwas this kind of meeting point.
p195
aVEverybody used to gather there.
p196
aVI think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant
p197
aVwhen he said that was a project of peace and unity,
p198
aVbecause I really felt that people were coming together.
p199
aVEveryone was greeting us with a smile, offering us a drink
p200
aVor inviting us into their own house for lunch.
p201
aVSometime, you are at the first level of a building,
p202
aVand somebody opens his window and offers you some tea.
p203
aVAnd then the same thing happens on the second floor.
p204
aVAnd you keep going all the way to the top.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VI think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd to be honest with you, we could have finished earlier,
p215
aVbut I think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VIn Egypt, they have another expression, which is "Nawartouna,"
p220
aVwhich means, "You brought light to us."
p221
aVIn Manshiyat Naser they were always telling us this.
p222
aVThe calligraphy, actually \u2014
p223
aVI used a white glow-in-the-dark paint for the calligraphy
p224
aVso at the end of the project, we rented some black light projectors
p225
aVand lit up the whole neighborhood,
p226
aVsurprising everybody around.
p227
aVWe wanted to tell them
p228
aVthat they are the ones who brought light to us.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VThe Zaraeeb community are strong, honest, hard workers,
p233
aVand they know their value.
p234
aVThe people of Cairo call them "the Zabaleen,"
p235
aVwhich means "the people of the garbage,"
p236
aVbut ironically, the people of Manshiyat Naser
p237
aVcall the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.
p238
aVThey say, they are the ones who produce the garbage, not them.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VThe goal was to leave something to this community,
p245
aVbut I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives.
p246
aVYou know, the art project was just a pretext
p247
aVfor this amazing human experience.
p248
aVThe art piece at some point will disappear, vanish,
p249
aVand actually there is somebody who is building a second floor
p250
aVin front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,
p251
aVso it's covering part of the painting,
p252
aVso I might need to go back and paint over it.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VIt was about the experience,
p257
aVabout the story,
p258
aVabout the moment.
p259
aa(lp260
VFrom the streets of the neighborhood,
p261
aVthe painting appears in fragments,
p262
aVisolated from one another,
p263
aVstanding alone.
p264
aVBut connected with the sign of calligraphy
p265
aVthat today reveals the powerful message that we should all think about
p266
aVbefore we want to judge somebody.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly
p269
aVneeds to wipe his eyes first.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.
