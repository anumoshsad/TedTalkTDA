VI have been a police officer for a very, very long time.
p4
aVAnd you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd if you know anything about black preachers,
p9
aVwe'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I need this to keep pushing this thing forward.
p14
aVI've been a police officer for a very long time,
p15
aVand I mean I predated technology.
p16
aVI'm talking about before pagers.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VLaugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth.
p21
aVI predate War on Our Fellow Man \u2014 I mean, War on Drugs.
p22
aVI predate all of that.
p23
aVI predate so much
p24
aVand I've been through ebbs and flows
p25
aVand I've been through good and bad times,
p26
aVand still I absolutely love being a police officer.
p27
aVI love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me
p28
aVand never a job.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd even with that,
p31
aVmy personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis.
p32
aVIt's an invisible crisis,
p33
aVand it has been for many, many years.
p34
aVEven though we in law enforcement say,
p35
aV"You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this."
p36
aVWe say in law enforcement things like,
p37
aV"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."
p38
aVYou know what?
p39
aVIn law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking
p40
aVand become more oriented to community policing.
p41
aVAnd yet all the while, still,
p42
aVwe continue in the same vein,
p43
aVthe same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd so that's the reason for me, several years ago.
p46
aVBecause I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination,
p47
aVI was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms.
p48
aVI was just so tired.
p49
aVI was tired of the vicious cycle,
p50
aVand I was tired of it even in the beloved agency
p51
aVin the department that I still love today.
p52
aVAnd so my wife and I, we sat down
p53
aVand we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire.
p54
aVWe would retire and I would go off into the sunset,
p55
aVmaybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time.
p56
aVY'all know what I'm talking about.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VBut we decided that I would retire.
p61
aVBut then there was a higher power than I.
p62
aVThere was a love for the city
p63
aVthat I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in \u2014
p64
aVa city that pulled my heart back into the system.
p65
aVSo we didn't retire.
p66
aVWe didn't retire
p67
aVand so what happened was,
p68
aVover the next \u2014 I would say, 18 months, 19 months,
p69
aVI had this passion to implement some radical policing.
p70
aVAnd so now, over the next 19 months,
p71
aVI shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant \u2014
p72
aVready to retire as a drug sergeant \u2014
p73
aVand went from level to level to level,
p74
aVuntil I find myself as a district commander,
p75
aVcommander of the worst district in Baltimore city.
p76
aVWe call it the Eastern District,
p77
aVthe most violent district,
p78
aVthe most impoverished district \u2014
p79
aV46 percent unemployment in that district.
p80
aVNational rating at that time,
p81
aVnational rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating],
p82
aVwas always on the top 10 list
p83
aVfor zip codes for cities across the nation,
p84
aVor just zip codes across the nation.
p85
aVThe top 10 \u2014 I didn't say state, I didn't say city \u2014
p86
aVthat little neighborhood.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd I said, you know what? We gotta do something different.
p89
aVWe gotta do something different. We gotta think radical.
p90
aVWe gotta think outside the box.
p91
aVAnd so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted
p92
aVand I desperately felt in my heart,
p93
aVI had to start listening to that inner spirit.
p94
aVI had to start listening to that man on the inside
p95
aVthat went against everything that I had been trained to do.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut we still did it.
p98
aVWe still did it because we listened to that inner spirit,
p99
aVbecause I realized this:
p100
aVif I was to see real police reform
p101
aVin the communities that I had authority over for public safety,
p102
aVwe had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
p103
aa(lp104
VWe had to change it.
p105
aVAnd so what we did is we started to think holistically
p106
aVand not paramilitarily.
p107
aVSo we thought differently.
p108
aVAnd we started to realize
p109
aVthat it could never be and never should have been
p110
aVus versus them.
p111
aVAnd so I decided to come to that intersection
p112
aVwhere I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors;
p113
aVwhere I would meet the businesses and the faith-based,
p114
aVand the eds, the meds,
p115
aVand I would meet all the people
p116
aVthat made up the communities that I had authority over.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I met them and I began to listen.
p119
aVSee, police have a problem.
p120
aVOff the top, we want to bring things into the community
p121
aVand come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments,
p122
aVbut we never talk to the community about them.
p123
aVAnd we shove them into the community and say, "Take that."
p124
aVBut we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin',
p125
aVso we talked to our communities.
p126
aVWe said, "This is your community table.
p127
aVWe'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you.
p128
aVWhat's going to work in your community?"
p129
aVAnd then some great things started to happen.
p130
aa(lp131
VSee, here's the thing:
p132
aVI had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage
p133
aVfrom being occupiers of communities
p134
aVto being partners.
p135
aVI had to figure out how to do that.
p136
aVBecause here's the crazy thing:
p137
aVin law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible.
p138
aVListen, we have become great protectors.
p139
aVWe know how to protect you.
p140
aVBut we have exercised that arm so much, so very much.
p141
aVIf I was a natural police department
p142
aVand I represented a police department,
p143
aVyou would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VIt's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.
p148
aVNo fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThat's a great arm \u2014 protection!
p153
aVThat's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes
p154
aVthat it has led to abuse.
p155
aVIt's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us.
p156
aVAnd we've forgotten
p157
aVthe mantra across this nation
p158
aVis to protect and serve.
p159
aVY'all don't know that? Protect and serve.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VSo you look at the other arm,
p164
aVand then you look at it and ... there it is.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VYou know, it's kinda weak.
p169
aVIt looks sickly.
p170
aVIt's withering and it's dying
p171
aVbecause we've invested so much in our protective arm.
p172
aVBut we forgot to treat our communities
p173
aVlike they're our customers;
p174
aVlike they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters,
p175
aVour mothers and fathers.
p176
aVAnd so somehow, along the way,
p177
aVwe've gotten out of balance.
p178
aVAnd because we are a proud profession,
p179
aVit is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes.
p180
aVIt's even harder to make a change.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so, as I try to hurry and get through this,
p183
aVI need to say this:
p184
aVit's not just law enforcement, though.
p185
aVBecause every one of us makes up a community.
p186
aVEverybody makes up a community.
p187
aVAnd as communities \u2014 can I say this? \u2014
p188
aVwe have put too much responsibility on law enforcement.
p189
aVToo much.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset
p194
aVwith law enforcement when we take action.
p195
aVThere is no way in the world
p196
aVthat we, as a community, should be calling the police
p197
aVfor kids playing ball in the street.
p198
aVNo way in the world that we should be calling the police
p199
aVbecause my neighbor's music is up too loud,
p200
aVbecause his dog came over to my yard and did a number two;
p201
aVthere's no way we should be calling the police.
p202
aVBut we have surrendered so much of our responsibility.
p203
aVListen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore \u2014
p204
aVand listen, we played rough in the street \u2014
p205
aVI ain't never see the police come and break us up.
p206
aVYou know who came? It was the elders.
p207
aVIt was the parental figures in the community.
p208
aVIt was those guardians, it was that village mentality.
p209
aVThey came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that."
p210
aVWe had mentors throughout all of the community.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo it takes all of us, all of us.
p213
aVAnd when I say community,
p214
aVI'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even \u2014
p215
aVlisten, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches,
p216
aVbecause I believe the churches too often have become MIA,
p217
aVmissing in action.
p218
aVI believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years
p219
aVfrom being community churches,
p220
aVwhere you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church.
p221
aVThey shifted from that and became commuter churches.
p222
aVSo you now have churches who have become disconnected by default
p223
aVfrom the very community where they're planted.
p224
aVAnd they don't take care of that community.
p225
aa(lp226
VI could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up.
p227
aVCommunity and policing:
p228
aVwe've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity.
p229
aVWe've lost it with one another.
p230
aVIt's not somebody else's fault \u2014
p231
aVit's all of our fault.
p232
aVWe all take responsibility in this.
p233
aVBut I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities
p234
aVand nation to make it great again.
p235
aVIt is never too late.
p236
aVIt is never too late.
p237
aVYou see, after three years
p238
aVof my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district,
p239
aVthree years in,
p240
aVafter putting pastors in the car with my police
p241
aVbecause I knew this \u2014 it's a little secret \u2014
p242
aVI knew this:
p243
aVit was hard to stay a nasty police officer
p244
aVwhile you're riding around with a clergy.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
VYou'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about:
p251
aV"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long \u2014 you can't do it!
p252
aVSo we came up with some incredible initiatives,
p253
aVengagements for our community and police to build that trust back.
p254
aVWe began to deal with our youth
p255
aVand with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence.
p256
aVWe knew we had an economic problem,
p257
aVso we began to create jobs.
p258
aVWe knew there was sickness in our community
p259
aVand they didn't have access to proper medical care,
p260
aVso we'd partner up.
p261
aVWe got to that intersection and partnered up
p262
aVwith anybody that wanted to partner with us
p263
aVand talked about what we needed holistically,
p264
aVnever thinking about the crime.
p265
aVBecause at the end of the day,
p266
aVif we took care of the needs of the people,
p267
aVif we got to the root cause,
p268
aVthe crime would take care of itself.
p269
aVIt would take care of itself.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint,
p274
aVwe looked back and we looked over
p275
aVand found out that we were at a 40-year historical low:
p276
aVour crime numbers, our homicides \u2014
p277
aVeverything had dropped down, back to the 1970s.
p278
aVAnd it might go back further,
p279
aVbut the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970.
p280
aVForty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me,
p281
aV"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?
p282
aVWhatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd so we gave them some of that.
p287
aVAnd in a short period of time,
p288
aVthe city went to a 30-year crime low.
p289
aVFor the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city,
p290
aVto under 200 homicides \u2014 197 to be exact.
p291
aVAnd we celebrated,
p292
aVbecause we had learned to become great servers,
p293
aVbecome great servers first.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut I gotta tell you this: these last few years,
p296
aVas much as we had learned
p297
aVto become great proactive police officers
p298
aVand great relational police officers rather than reactive,
p299
aVthese last years have disappointed me.
p300
aVThey have broken my heart.
p301
aVThe uprising still hurts.
p302
aVIt still hurts my heart,
p303
aVbecause truly I believe that it should've never happened.
p304
aVI believe it should've never happened
p305
aVif we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in,
p306
aVservicing our community,
p307
aVtreating them like human beings, treating them with respect,
p308
aVloving on them first.
p309
aVIf we continued in that vein,
p310
aVit would've never happened.
p311
aVBut somehow, we went back to business as usual.
p312
aa(lp313
VBut I'm excited again!
p314
aVI'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner
p315
aVwho not only talks about community policing,
p316
aVbut he absolutely understands it,
p317
aVand more importantly, he embraces it.
p318
aVSo I'm very excited now.
p319
aVListen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,
p320
aVbecause we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes.
p321
aVI believe \u2014 I truly believe \u2014
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
p324
aa(lp325
Vthat we will be great again.
p326
aVI believe,
p327
aVas we continue to wrap arms and continue to say,
p328
aV"We're in this together,"
p329
aVbecause it's not just an intersection:
p330
aVonce we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals,
p331
aVand this city will become great again.
p332
aVThis nation will become great again.
p333
aVBecause we have the same goal: we all want peace.
p334
aVWe all want respect for one another.
p335
aVWe all want love.
p336
aVAnd I believe we are back on that road,
p337
aVand I'm so excited about it.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.
p340
aa(lp341
VGod bless you all.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VGod bless you.
