VI was recently traveling in the Highlands of New Guinea,
p4
aVand I was talking with a man who had three wives.
p5
aVI asked him, "How many wives would you like to have?"
p6
aVAnd there was this long pause,
p7
aVand I thought to myself,
p8
aV"Is he going to say five?
p9
aVIs he going to say 10?
p10
aVIs he going to say 25?"
p11
aVAnd he leaned towards me
p12
aVand he whispered, "None."
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VEighty-six percent of human societies permit a man to have several wives:
p17
aVpolygyny.
p18
aVBut in the vast majority of these cultures,
p19
aVonly about five or ten percent of men actually do have several wives.
p20
aVHaving several partners can be a toothache.
p21
aVIn fact, co-wives can fight with each other,
p22
aVsometimes they can even poison each other's children.
p23
aVAnd you've got to have a lot of cows, a lot of goats,
p24
aVa lot of money, a lot of land,
p25
aVin order to build a harem.
p26
aa(lp27
VWe are a pair-bonding species.
p28
aVNinety-seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young;
p29
aVhuman beings do.
p30
aVI'm not suggesting that we're not \u2014
p31
aVthat we're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners.
p32
aVI've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,
p33
aVI understand, actually, some of the genetics of it,
p34
aVand some of the brain circuitry of it.
p35
aVIt's very common around the world,
p36
aVbut we are built to love.
p37
aa(lp38
VHow is technology changing love?
p39
aVI'm going to say almost not at all.
p40
aVI study the brain.
p41
aVI and my colleagues have put over 100 people into a brain scanner \u2014
p42
aVpeople who had just fallen happily in love,
p43
aVpeople who had just been rejected in love
p44
aVand people who are in love long-term.
p45
aVAnd it is possible to remain "in love" long-term.
p46
aVAnd I've long ago maintained
p47
aVthat we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems
p48
aVfor mating and reproduction:
p49
aVsex drive,
p50
aVfeelings of intense romantic love
p51
aVand feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a long-term partner.
p52
aVAnd together, these three brain systems \u2014
p53
aVwith many other parts of the brain \u2014
p54
aVorchestrate our sexual, our romantic and our family lives.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut they lie way below the cortex,
p57
aVway below the limbic system where we feel our emotions,
p58
aVgenerate our emotions.
p59
aVThey lie in the most primitive parts of the brain, linked with energy,
p60
aVfocus, craving, motivation, wanting and drive.
p61
aVIn this case,
p62
aVthe drive to win life's greatest prize:
p63
aVa mating partner.
p64
aVThey evolved over 4.4 million years ago among our first ancestors,
p65
aVand they're not going to change if you swipe left or right on Tinder.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
V(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VThere's no question that technology is changing the way we court:
p72
aVemailing, texting,
p73
aVemojis to express your emotions,
p74
aVsexting,
p75
aV"liking" a photograph, selfies ...
p76
aVWe're seeing new rules and taboos for how to court.
p77
aVBut, you know \u2014
p78
aVis this actually dramatically changing love?
p79
aVWhat about the late 1940s,
p80
aVwhen the automobile became very popular
p81
aVand we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VHow about the introduction of the birth control pill?
p86
aVUnchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin,
p87
aVwomen could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality.
p88
aa(lp89
VEven dating sites are not changing love.
p90
aVI'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,
p91
aVI've been it for 11 years.
p92
aVI keep telling them and they agree with me,
p93
aVthat these are not dating sites,
p94
aVthey are introducing sites.
p95
aVWhen you sit down in a bar,
p96
aVin a coffee house,
p97
aVon a park bench,
p98
aVyour ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened,
p99
aVand you smile
p100
aVand laugh
p101
aVand listen
p102
aVand parade the way our ancestors did 100,000 years ago.
p103
aVWe can give you various people \u2014
p104
aVall the dating sites can \u2014
p105
aVbut the only real algorithm is your own human brain.
p106
aVTechnology is not going to change that.
p107
aa(lp108
VTechnology is also not going to change who you choose to love.
p109
aVI study the biology of personality,
p110
aVand I've come to believe
p111
aVthat we've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving,
p112
aVlinked with the dopamine, serotonin,
p113
aVtestosterone and estrogen systems.
p114
aVSo I created a questionnaire directly from brain science
p115
aVto measure the degree to which you express the traits \u2014
p116
aVthe constellation of traits \u2014
p117
aVlinked with each of these four brain systems.
p118
aVI then put that questionnaire on various dating sites
p119
aVin 40 countries.
p120
aVFourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire,
p121
aVand I've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to whom.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd as it turns out,
p124
aVthose who were very expressive of the dopamine system
p125
aVtend to be curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic \u2014
p126
aVI would imagine there's an awful lot of people like that in this room \u2014
p127
aVthey're drawn to people like themselves.
p128
aVCurious, creative people need people like themselves.
p129
aVPeople who are very expressive of the serotonin system
p130
aVtend to be traditional, conventional, they follow the rules,
p131
aVthey respect authority,
p132
aVthey tend to be religious \u2014 religiosity is in the serotonin system \u2014
p133
aVand traditional people go for traditional people.
p134
aVIn that way, similarity attracts.
p135
aVIn the other two cases, opposites attract.
p136
aVPeople very expressive of the testosterone system
p137
aVtend to be analytical, logical, direct, decisive,
p138
aVand they go for their opposite:
p139
aVthey go for somebody who's high estrogen,
p140
aVsomebody who's got very good verbal skills
p141
aVand people skills,
p142
aVwho's very intuitive
p143
aVand who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive.
p144
aVWe have natural patterns of mate choice.
p145
aVModern technology is not going to change who we choose to love.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut technology is producing one modern trend
p148
aVthat I find particularly important.
p149
aVIt's associated with the concept of paradox of choice.
p150
aVFor millions of years,
p151
aVwe lived in little hunting and gathering groups.
p152
aVYou didn't have the opportunity to choose
p153
aVbetween 1,000 people on a dating site.
p154
aVIn fact, I've been studying this recently,
p155
aVand I actually think there's some sort of sweet spot in the brain;
p156
aVI don't know what it is, but apparently, from reading a lot of the data,
p157
aVwe can embrace about five to nine alternatives, and after that,
p158
aVyou get into what academics call "cognitive overload,"
p159
aVand you don't choose any.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I've come to think that due to this cognitive overload,
p162
aVwe're ushering in a new form of courtship
p163
aVthat I call "slow love."
p164
aVI arrived at this during my work with Match.com.
p165
aVEvery year for the last six years,
p166
aVwe've done a study called "Singles in America."
p167
aVWe don't poll the Match population,
p168
aVwe poll the American population.
p169
aVWe use 5,000-plus people,
p170
aVa representative sample of Americans based on the US census.
p171
aa(lp172
VWe've got data now on over 30,000 people,
p173
aVand every single year,
p174
aVI see some of the same patterns.
p175
aVEvery single year when I ask the question,
p176
aVover 50 percent of people have had a one-night stand \u2014
p177
aVnot necessarily last year, but in their lives \u2014
p178
aV50 percent have had a friends with benefits
p179
aVduring the course of their lives,
p180
aVand over 50 percent have lived with a person long-term
p181
aVbefore marrying.
p182
aVAmericans think that this is reckless.
p183
aVI have doubted that for a long time;
p184
aVthe patterns are too strong.
p185
aVThere's got to be some Darwinian explanation \u2014
p186
aVNot that many people are crazy.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd I stumbled, then, on a statistic that really came home to me.
p189
aVIt was a very interesting academic article
p190
aVin which I found that 67 percent of singles in America today
p191
aVwho are living long-term with somebody,
p192
aVhave not yet married because they are terrified of divorce.
p193
aVThey're terrified of the social,
p194
aVlegal, emotional,
p195
aVeconomic consequences of divorce.
p196
aVSo I came to realize that I don't think this is recklessness;
p197
aVI think it's caution.
p198
aVToday's singles want to know every single thing about a partner
p199
aVbefore they wed.
p200
aVYou learn a lot between the sheets,
p201
aVnot only about how somebody makes love,
p202
aVbut whether they're kind,
p203
aVwhether they can listen
p204
aVand at my age,
p205
aVwhether they've got a sense of humor.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd in an age where we have too many choices,
p210
aVwe have very little fear of pregnancy and disease
p211
aVand we've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage,
p212
aVI think people are taking their time to love.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd actually, what's happening is,
p215
aVwhat we're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage
p216
aVbefore you tie the knot.
p217
aVWhere marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship,
p218
aVnow it's the finale.
p219
aVBut the human brain \u2014
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VThe human brain always triumphs,
p224
aVand indeed, in the United States today,
p225
aV86 percent of Americans will marry by age 49.
p226
aVAnd even in cultures around the world where they're not marrying as often,
p227
aVthey are settling down eventually with a long-term partner.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo it began to occur to me:
p230
aVduring this long extension of the precommitment stage,
p231
aVif you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry,
p232
aVmaybe we're going to see more happy marriages.
p233
aVSo I did a study of 1,100 married people in America \u2014
p234
aVnot on Match.com, of course \u2014
p235
aVand I asked them a lot of questions.
p236
aVBut one of the questions was,
p237
aV"Would you re-marry the person you're currently married to?"
p238
aVAnd 81 percent said, "Yes."
p239
aa(lp240
VIn fact, the greatest change in modern romance and family life
p241
aVis not technology.
p242
aVIt's not even slow love.
p243
aVIt's actually women piling into the job market
p244
aVin cultures around the world.
p245
aVFor millions of years,
p246
aVour ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups.
p247
aVWomen commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables.
p248
aVThey came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
p249
aVThe double-income family was the rule.
p250
aVAnd women were regarded as just as economically, socially
p251
aVand sexually powerful as men.
p252
aa(lp253
VThen the environment changed some 10,000 years ago,
p254
aVwe began to settle down on the farm
p255
aVand both men and women became obliged, really,
p256
aVto marry the right person,
p257
aVfrom the right background,
p258
aVfrom the right religion
p259
aVand from the right kin and social and political connections.
p260
aVMen's jobs became more important:
p261
aVthey had to move the rocks, fell the trees, plow the land.
p262
aVThey brought the produce to local markets, and came home
p263
aVwith the equivalent of money.
p264
aa(lp265
VAlong with this,
p266
aVwe see a rise of a host of beliefs:
p267
aVthe belief of virginity at marriage,
p268
aVarranged marriages \u2014 strictly arranged marriages \u2014
p269
aVthe belief that the man is the head of the household,
p270
aVthat the wife's place is in the home
p271
aVand most important,
p272
aVhonor thy husband, and 'til death do us part.
p273
aVThese are gone.
p274
aVThey are going, and in many places,
p275
aVthey are gone.
p276
aa(lp277
VWe are right now in a marriage revolution.
p278
aVWe are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition
p279
aVand moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes \u2014
p280
aVsomething I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
p281
aa(lp282
VI'm not a Pollyanna;
p283
aVthere's a great deal to cry about.
p284
aVI've studied divorce in 80 cultures,
p285
aVI've studied, as I say, adultery in many \u2014
p286
aVthere's a whole pile of problems.
p287
aVAs William Butler Yeats, the poet, once said,
p288
aV"Love is the crooked thing."
p289
aVI would add, "Nobody gets out alive."
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VWe all have problems.
p294
aVBut in fact, I think the poet Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.
p295
aVHe said, "The dark, uneasy world of family life \u2014
p296
aVwhere the greatest can fail, and the humblest succeed."
p297
aa(lp298
VBut I will leave you with this:
p299
aVlove and attachment will prevail,
p300
aVtechnology cannot change it.
p301
aVAnd I will conclude by saying
p302
aVany understanding of human relationships must take into account
p303
aVone the most powerful determinants of human behavior:
p304
aVthe unquenchable,
p305
aVadaptable
p306
aVand primordial human drive to love.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Applause)
p311
aa(lp312
VKelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much for that, Helen.
p313
aVAs you know, there's another speaker here with us
p314
aVthat works in your same field.
p315
aVShe comes at it from a different perspective.
p316
aVEsther Perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples.
p317
aVYou study data,
p318
aVEsther studies the stories the couples tell her
p319
aVwhen they come to her for help.
p320
aVLet's have her join us on the stage.
p321
aVEsther?
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
p324
aa(lp325
VSo Esther,
p326
aVwhen you were watching Helen's talk,
p327
aVwas there any part of it
p328
aVthat resonated with you through the lens of your own work
p329
aVthat you'd like to comment on?
p330
aa(lp331
VEsther Perel: It's interesting, because on the one hand,
p332
aVthe need for love is ubiquitous and universal.
p333
aVBut the way we love \u2014
p334
aVthe meaning we make out of it \u2014
p335
aVthe rules that govern our relationships, I think,
p336
aVare changing fundamentally.
p337
aa(lp338
VWe come from a model that, until now,
p339
aVwas primarily regulated around duty and obligation,
p340
aVthe needs of the collective and loyalty.
p341
aVAnd we have shifted it
p342
aVto a model of free choice and individual rights,
p343
aVand self-fulfillment and happiness.
p344
aVAnd so, that was the first thing I thought,
p345
aVthat the need doesn't change,
p346
aVbut the context and the way we regulate these relationships
p347
aVchanges a lot.
p348
aa(lp349
VOn the paradox of choice \u2014
p350
aVyou know, on the one hand we relish the novelty
p351
aVand the playfulness, I think,
p352
aVto be able to have so many options.
p353
aVAnd at the same time,
p354
aVas you talk about this cognitive overload,
p355
aVI see many, many people who ...
p356
aVwho dread the uncertainty and self-doubt
p357
aVthat comes with this massa of choice,
p358
aVcreating a case of "FOMO"
p359
aVand then leading us \u2014
p360
aVFOMO, fear of missed opportunity, or fear of missing out \u2014
p361
aVit's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' \u2014
p362
aVthe right one?"
p363
aa(lp364
VSo we've created what I call this thing of "stable ambiguity."
p365
aVStable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone
p366
aVbut also not really willing to engage in intimacy-building.
p367
aVIt's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship
p368
aVbut also the uncertainty of the breakup.
p369
aVSo, here on the internet you have three major ones.
p370
aVOne is icing and simmering,
p371
aVwhich are great stalling tactics
p372
aVthat offer a kind of holding pattern
p373
aVthat emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship
p374
aVbut at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency
p375
aVand enough freedom of the undefined boundaries.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VYeah?
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd then comes ghosting.
p382
aVAnd ghosting is, basically,
p383
aVyou disappear from this massa of texts on the spot,
p384
aVand you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another,
p385
aVbecause you're making it invisible even to yourself.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VYeah?
p390
aa(lp391
VSo I was thinking \u2014 these words came up for me as I was listening to you,
p392
aVlike how a vocabulary also creates a reality,
p393
aVand at the same time,
p394
aVthat's my question to you:
p395
aVDo you think when the context changes,
p396
aVit still means that the nature of love remains the same?
p397
aa(lp398
VYou study the brain and I study people's relationships and stories,
p399
aVso I think it's everything you say, plus.
p400
aVBut I don't always know the degree to which a changing context ...
p401
aVDoes it at some point begin to change \u2014
p402
aVIf the meaning changes, does it change the need,
p403
aVor is the need clear of the entire context?
p404
aa(lp405
VHF: Wow! Well \u2014
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
V(Applause)
p410
aa(lp411
VWell, I've got three points here, right?
p412
aVFirst of all, to your first one:
p413
aVthere's no question that we've changed, that we now want a person to love,
p414
aVand for thousands of years, we had to marry the right person
p415
aVfrom the right background and right kin connection.
p416
aVAnd in fact, in my studies of 5,000 people every year,
p417
aVI ask them, "What are you looking for?"
p418
aVAnd every single year, over 97 percent say \u2014
p419
aa(lp420
VEP: The list grows \u2014
p421
aa(lp422
VHF: Well, no.
p423
aVThe basic thing is over 97 percent of people
p424
aVwant somebody that respects them,
p425
aVsomebody they can trust and confide in,
p426
aVsomebody who makes them laugh,
p427
aVsomebody who makes enough time for them
p428
aVand somebody who they find physically attractive.
p429
aVThat never changes.
p430
aVAnd there's certainly \u2014 you know, there's two parts \u2014
p431
aa(lp432
VEP: But you know how I call that?
p433
aVThat's not what people used to say \u2014
p434
aa(lp435
VHF: That's exactly right.
p436
aa(lp437
VEP: They said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship,
p438
aVeconomic support, children.
p439
aVWe went from a production economy to a service economy.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VWe did it in the larger culture, and we're doing it in marriage.
p444
aa(lp445
VHF: Right, no question about it.
p446
aVBut it's interesting, the millennials actually want to be very good parents,
p447
aVwhereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage
p448
aVbut is not as focused on being a good parent.
p449
aVYou see all of these nuances.
p450
aa(lp451
VThere's two basic parts of personality:
p452
aVthere's your culture \u2014 everything you grew up to do and believe and say \u2014
p453
aVand there's your temperament.
p454
aVBasically, what I've been talking about is your temperament.
p455
aVAnd that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times
p456
aVand changing beliefs.
p457
aa(lp458
VAnd in terms of the paradox of choice,
p459
aVthere's no question about it that this is a pickle.
p460
aVThere were millions of years where you found that sweet boy
p461
aVat the other side of the water hole,
p462
aVand you went for it.
p463
aa(lp464
VEP: Yes, but you \u2014
p465
aa(lp466
VHF: I do want to say one more thing.
p467
aVThe bottom line is, in hunting and gathering societies,
p468
aVthey tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives.
p469
