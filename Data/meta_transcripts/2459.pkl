VToday's computers are so amazing
p4
aVthat we fail to notice how terrible they really are.
p5
aVI'd like to talk to you today about this problem,
p6
aVand how we can fix it with neuroscience.
p7
aa(lp8
VFirst, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011
p9
aVthat had a profound impact on me.
p10
aVI was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University,
p11
aVwhere I studied computer science and neuroscience,
p12
aVand I was having this great conversation with a fellow student
p13
aVabout the power of holograms to one day replace computers.
p14
aVAnd just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation,
p15
aVof course, his phone lights up.
p16
aVAnd he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.
p17
aVAnd then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes,
p18
aV"Keep going. I'm with you."
p19
aVBut of course his eyes were glazed over,
p20
aVand the moment was dead.
p21
aa(lp22
VMeanwhile across the bar,
p23
aVI noticed another student holding his phone,
p24
aVthis time towards a group.
p25
aVHe was swiping through pictures on Instagram,
p26
aVand these kids were laughing hysterically.
p27
aVAnd that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling
p28
aVand how happy they were feeling about the same technology,
p29
aVreally got me thinking.
p30
aVAnd the more I thought of it, the more I realized
p31
aVit was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here,
p32
aVit was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend
p33
aVand that was binding those kids together.
p34
aa(lp35
VSee, they were connected around something,
p36
aVjust like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions
p37
aVtelling stories around the campfire.
p38
aVAnd that's exactly what tools should do, I think.
p39
aVThey should extend our bodies.
p40
aVAnd I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.
p41
aVWhether you're sending an email to your wife
p42
aVor you're composing a symphony
p43
aVor just consoling a friend,
p44
aVyou're doing it in pretty much the same way.
p45
aVYou're hunched over these rectangles,
p46
aVfumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.
p47
aVAnd I think this is the wrong way,
p48
aVI think we can start using a much more natural machine.
p49
aVWe should use machines that bring our work back into the world.
p50
aVWe should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience
p51
aVto extend our senses versus going against them.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow it just so happens that I have such a machine here.
p54
aVIt's called the Meta 2.
p55
aVLet's try it out.
p56
aVNow in front of me right now, I can see the audience,
p57
aVand I can see my very hands.
p58
aVAnd in three, two, one,
p59
aVwe're going to see an immersive hologram appear,
p60
aVa very realistic hologram appear in front of me,
p61
aVof our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.
p62
aVAnd of course this could be anything that we're shopping for
p63
aVor learning from,
p64
aVand I can use my hands
p65
aVto very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.
p66
aVAnd I think Iron Man would be proud.
p67
aVWe're going to come back to this in just a bit.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VNow if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling
p72
aVwith the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology,
p73
aVso let's look at a few.
p74
aa(lp75
VMy mom is an architect,
p76
aVso naturally the first thing I imagined
p77
aVwas laying out a building in 3D space
p78
aVinstead of having to use these 2D floor plans.
p79
aVShe's actually touching graphics right now
p80
aVand selecting an interior decor.
p81
aVThis was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd this next use case is very personal to me,
p84
aVit's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project,
p85
aVcourtesy of UCSF.
p86
aVAs a neuroscience student,
p87
aVI would always fantasize
p88
aVabout the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures
p89
aVwith an actual machine,
p90
aVwhere I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow what you're seeing is called augmented reality,
p93
aVbut to me, it's part of a much more important story \u2014
p94
aVa story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices,
p95
aVinstead of the other way around.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow ...
p98
aVin the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.
p99
aVWe're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information
p100
aVon the real world.
p101
aVJust imagine for a moment
p102
aVwhat this could mean for storytellers,
p103
aVfor painters,
p104
aVfor brain surgeons,
p105
aVfor interior decorators
p106
aVand maybe for all of us here today.
p107
aVAnd what I think we need to do as a community,
p108
aVis really try and make an effort
p109
aVto imagine how we can create this new reality
p110
aVin a way that extends the human experience,
p111
aVinstead of gamifying our reality
p112
aVor cluttering it with digital information.
p113
aVAnd that's what I'm very passionate about.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, I want to tell you a little secret.
p116
aVIn about five years \u2014
p117
aVthis is not the smallest device \u2014
p118
aVin about five years,
p119
aVthese are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes
p120
aVthat project holograms.
p121
aVAnd just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy
p122
aVin terms of the hardware \u2014 we buy it for the operating system \u2014
p123
aVas a neuroscientist,
p124
aVI always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.
p125
aVAnd it's very, very important that we get this right,
p126
aVbecause we might be living inside of these things
p127
aVfor at least as long as we've lived
p128
aVwith the Windows graphical user interface.
p129
aVAnd I don't know about you,
p130
aVbut living inside of Windows scares me.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VTo isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity,
p135
aVwe use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines,
p136
aVinstead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.
p137
aVAnd the principle we all revolve around
p138
aVis what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."
p139
aa(lp140
VAt every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain
p141
aVon, for the first time, our brain's terms.
p142
aVIn other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.
p143
aVWe're building a system that you've always known how to use.
p144
aa(lp145
VHere are the first three design guidelines that we employ
p146
aVin this brand-new form of user experience.
p147
aVFirst and foremost, you are the operating system.
p148
aVTraditional file systems are complex and abstract,
p149
aVand they take your brain extra steps to decode them.
p150
aVWe're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.
p151
aVMeanwhile, in augmented reality,
p152
aVyou can of course place your holographic TED panel over here,
p153
aVand your holographic email on the other side of the desk,
p154
aVand your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.
p155
aVYou could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for \u2014
p156
aVor whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VPerfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe second interface guideline we call "touch to see."
p163
aVWhat do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?
p164
aVThey try and reach out and touch it.
p165
aVAnd that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.
p166
aVTurns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost
p167
aVfrom a sense we call proprioception \u2014
p168
aVthat's the sense of our body parts in space.
p169
aVSo by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better,
p170
aVwe're also going to understand it much more deeply.
p171
aVHence, touch to see.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
p174
aVWe're inherently these social primates.
p175
aVAnd this leads me to our third guideline,
p176
aVthe holographic campfire from our first story.
p177
aa(lp178
VOur mirror-neuron subsystem suggests
p179
aVthat we can connect with each other and with our work much better
p180
aVif we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.
p181
aVSo if you look at the video behind me,
p182
aVyou can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram,
p183
aVmaking eye contact, connected around this thing,
p184
aVinstead of being distracted by external devices.
p185
aa(lp186
VLet's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.
p187
aVSo again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
p188
aVI'm going to now take a step further
p189
aVand go ahead and grab this pair of glasses
p190
aVand leave it right here by the desk.
p191
aVI'm now with you, I'm in the moment,
p192
aVwe're connecting.
p193
aVMy spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it
p194
aVand bring it right back here, reminding me
p195
aVthat I am the operating system.
p196
aVAnd now my proprioception is working,
p197
aVand I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts
p198
aVand touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut it's not enough to see things alone,
p201
aVso in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call \u2014
p202
aVRay?
p203
aa(lp204
V(Ringing)
p205
aa(lp206
VHey Ray, how's it going?
p207
aVGuys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
p208
aVAnd he is photo-realistic.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you.
p213
aa(lp214
VMy mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones
p215
aVin not too long.
p216
aVRay, how's it going?
p217
aa(lp218
VRay: Great. We're live today.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VMG: Ray, give the crowd a gift
p223
aVof the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier.
p224
aVGuys, this is not only going to change phones,
p225
aVit's also going to change the way we collaborate.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you so much.
p228
aa(lp229
VThanks, Ray.
p230
aa(lp231
VRay: You're welcome.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VMG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011:
p236
aVThe future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens.
p237
aVIt's right here, inside of us.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VSo if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today,
p242
aVit's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future,
p243
aVit's right here in 2016.
p244
aVWhich is why all hundred of us at Meta,
p245
aVincluding the administrative staff,
p246
aVthe executives,
p247
aVthe designers, the engineers \u2014
p248
aVbefore TED2017,
p249
aVwe're all going to be throwing away our external monitors
p250
aVand replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
p251
aa(lp252
VThank you very much.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you, appreciate it.
p257
aVThanks, guys.
p258
aa(lp259
VChris Anderson: So help me out on one thing,
p260
aVbecause there've been a few augmented reality demos
p261
aVshown over the last year or so out there.
p262
aVAnd there's sometimes a debate among technologists
p263
aVabout, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen?
p264
aVThere's this issue of field of view,
p265
aVthat somehow the technology is showing a broader view
p266
aVthan you would actually see wearing the glasses.
p267
aVWere we seeing the real deal there?
p268
aa(lp269
VMG: Absolutely the real deal.
p270
aVNot only that,
p271
aVwe took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens
p272
aVin the various videos that you've seen here.
p273
aVWe want to try to simulate the experience for the world
p274
aVthat we're actually seeing through the glasses,
p275
aVand not cut any corners.
p276
aa(lp277
VCA: Thank you so much for showing us that.
p278
aa(lp279
VMG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
