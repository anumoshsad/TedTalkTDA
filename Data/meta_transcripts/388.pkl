VI think the future of this planet depends on humans,
p4
aVnot technology, and we already have the knowledge \u2014
p5
aVwe\u2019re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.
p6
aVBut we\u2019re nowhere near the endgame
p7
aVwhen it comes to our perception.
p8
aVWe still have one foot in the dark ages.
p9
aVAnd when you listen to some of the presentations here \u2014
p10
aVand the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings \u2014
p11
aVand then you contrast it with the fact
p12
aVwe still call this planet, "Earth:" it\u2019s pretty extraordinary \u2014
p13
aVwe have one foot in the dark ages.
p14
aa(lp15
VJust quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It\u2019s not flat, stupid, it\u2019s round."
p16
aVGalileo \u2014 he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite \u2014
p17
aVhis was, "It\u2019s not in the middle, you know."
p18
aVAnd Hawkes: "it\u2019s not earth, stupid, it\u2019s ocean."
p19
aVThis is an ocean planet.
p20
aVT.S. Eliot really said it for me \u2014
p21
aVand this should give you goose bumps:
p22
aV"we shall not cease from exploration
p23
aVand the end of our exploring shall be to return
p24
aVwhere we started and know the place for the first time."
p25
aVAnd the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,
p26
aVwhere the last of earth discovered
p27
aVis that which is the beginning."
p28
aVSo I have one message.
p29
aVIt seems to me that we\u2019re all pointed in the wrong direction.
p30
aa(lp31
VFor the rocketeers in the audience:
p32
aVI love what you\u2019re doing, I admire the guts,
p33
aVI admire the courage \u2014 but your rockets
p34
aVare pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVAnd it\u2019s all a question of perspective.
p37
aVLet me try and tell you \u2014
p38
aVI don\u2019t mean to insult you, but look,
p39
aVif I \u2014 and I\u2019m not doing this for real
p40
aVbecause it would be an insult,
p41
aVso I\u2019m going to pretend, and it softens the blow \u2014
p42
aVI\u2019m going to tell you what you\u2019re thinking.
p43
aVIf I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,
p44
aVand I held up another square that was the root two square \u2014
p45
aVso it\u2019s 1.5 times bigger \u2014 and was the color of the oceans;
p46
aVand I said, what is the relative value of these two things?
p47
aVWell, it\u2019s the relative importance.
p48
aVYou would say \u2014 yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;
p49
aVwater covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.
p50
aVBut it\u2019s a question of perception,
p51
aVand if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking,
p52
aVif that\u2019s what you think I mean when I say,
p53
aV"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"
p54
aVIf you think that that\u2019s the relative importance,
p55
aVtwo to one, you\u2019re wrong by a factor of ten.
p56
aVNow, you\u2019re not as thick as two short planks,
p57
aVbut you sound like it when you say "Earth,"
p58
aVbecause that demonstration, if I turned around this way \u2014
p59
aVthat earth plane would be as thin as paper.
p60
aVIt\u2019s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.
p61
aVThe ocean representation would have a depth to it.
p62
aVAnd if you hefted those two things
p63
aVyou might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt turns out that something more than
p66
aV94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.
p67
aVThat means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.
p68
aVThe problem we have in believing that
p69
aVis \u2014 you just have to give up this notion
p70
aVthat this Earth was created for us.
p71
aVBecause it\u2019s a problem we have.
p72
aVIf this is an ocean planet
p73
aVand we only have a small minority of this planet,
p74
aVit just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.
p75
aa(lp76
VOkay. Let me criticize this thing.
p77
aVI\u2019m not talking about James Cameron \u2014
p78
aValthough I could, but I won\u2019t.
p79
aVYou really do have to go and see his latest film,
p80
aV"Aliens of the Deep." It\u2019s incredible.
p81
aVIt features two of these deep rovers,
p82
aVand I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.
p83
aVThis, I think, represents one of the most beautiful
p84
aVclassic submersibles built.
p85
aVIf you look at that sub, you\u2019ll see a sphere.
p86
aVThis is an acryclic sphere.
p87
aVIt generates all of the buoyancy,
p88
aVall of the payload for the craft,
p89
aVand the batteries are down here hanging underneath,
p90
aVexactly like a balloon.
p91
aVThis is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.
p92
aVAlso coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.
p93
aVAnd this one actually carries two great manipulators.
p94
aVIt actually is a very good working sub \u2014
p95
aVthat\u2019s what it was designed for.
p96
aVThe problem with it is \u2014
p97
aVand the reason I will never build another one like it \u2014
p98
aVis that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.
p99
aVIt\u2019s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;
p100
aVwe take all our terrestrial hang-ups,
p101
aVall our constraints \u2014 importantly,
p102
aVthese two-dimensional constraints that we have,
p103
aVand they\u2019re so constrained we don\u2019t even understand it \u2014
p104
aVand we take them underwater.
p105
aVYou notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
p106
aVA seat works in a two-dimensional world,
p107
aVwhere gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?
p108
aVAnd in a two-dimensional world,
p109
aVwe do know about the third dimension
p110
aVbut we don\u2019t use it because to go up
p111
aVrequires an awful lot of energy against gravity.
p112
aVAnd then our mothers tell us,
p113
aV"Careful you don\u2019t fall down" \u2014 because you\u2019ll fall over.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.
p116
aVThis planet has an inner atmosphere of water;
p117
aVit\u2019s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres \u2014
p118
aVa lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.
p119
aVMost of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.
p120
aVAnd that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,
p121
aVwhich is alien to us.
p122
aVFish do not sit in seats.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVThey don\u2019t. Their mothers don\u2019t say to little baby fish,
p125
aV"Careful you don\u2019t fall over."
p126
aVThey don\u2019t fall over. They don\u2019t fall.
p127
aVThey live in a three-dimensional world
p128
aVwhere there is no difference in energy
p129
aVbetween going this way, that way, that way or that way.
p130
aVIt\u2019s truly a three-dimensional space.
p131
aVAnd we\u2019re only just beginning to grasp it.
p132
aVI don\u2019t know of any other submersible,
p133
aVor even remote, that just takes advantage
p134
aVthat this is a three-dimensional space.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is the way we should be going into the oceans.
p137
aVThis is a three-dimensional machine.
p138
aVWhat we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,
p139
aVand move in this three-dimensional space.
p140
aVOK, this is good stuff.
p141
aVThis is man\u2019s first attempt at flying underwater.
p142
aVRight now, I\u2019m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.
p143
aVShe has twice the wingspan that I do.
p144
aVThere I\u2019m coming; she sees me.
p145
aVAnd just notice how she rolls under and turns;
p146
aVshe doesn\u2019t sit there and try and blow air into a tank
p147
aVand kind of flow up or sink down \u2014 she just rolls.
p148
aVAnd the craft that I\u2019m in \u2014
p149
aVthis hasn\u2019t been shown before.
p150
aVChris asked us to show stuff that hasn\u2019t been shown before.
p151
aVI wanted you to notice
p152
aVthat she actually turned to come back up.
p153
aVThere I am; I see her coming back,
p154
aVcoming up underneath me.
p155
aVI put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.
p156
aVI\u2019m trying to do everything very gently.
p157
aVWe spent about three hours together and she\u2019s beginning to trust me.
p158
aVAnd this ballet is controlled by this lady here.
p159
aVShe gets about that close and then she pulls away.
p160
aVSo now I try and go after her, but I\u2019m practicing flying.
p161
aVThis is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.
p162
aVThis was a fly by wire. It has wings.
p163
aVThere\u2019re no silly buoyancy tanks \u2014
p164
aVit\u2019s permanently, positively buoyant.
p165
aVAnd then by moving through the water
p166
aVit\u2019s able to take that control.
p167
aVNow, look at that; look, it\u2019s \u2014 she just blew me away.
p168
aVShe just rolled right away from underneath.
p169
aVReally that\u2019s the only real dive I\u2019ve ever made in this machine.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt took 10 years to build.
p172
aVBut this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.
p173
aVWe just learned so much in three hours in the water there.
p174
aVI just had to go and build another machine.
p175
aVBut look here. Instead of blowing tanks
p176
aVand coming up slowly without thinking about it,
p177
aVit\u2019s a little bit of back pressure,
p178
aVand that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.
p181
aVI don\u2019t really look that ugly,
p182
aVbut the camera is so close that it\u2019s just distorted.
p183
aVNow, there she goes, right overhead.
p184
aVThis is a wide-angle camera.
p185
aVShe\u2019s just a few inches off the top of my head.
p186
aV"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,
p187
aVoh, I don\u2019t know, just so close."
p188
aVI come back up, not for air.
p189
aV"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I\u2019m speechless.
p190
aVWe\u2019ve been just feet apart. I\u2019m going back down now."
p191
aVOkay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VTrying to fly and keep up with that animal \u2014
p195
aVit wasn\u2019t the lack of maneuverability that we had.
p196
aVIt was the fact she was going so slow.
p197
aVI actually designed that to move faster through the water
p198
aVbecause I thought that was the thing
p199
aVthat we needed to do: to move fast and get range.
p200
aVBut after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.
p201
aVShe wanted to dance.
p202
aVAnd so what we needed to do was increase the wing area
p203
aVso that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo the sub that was outside last year \u2014 this is the one.
p206
aVYou see the larger wing area here.
p207
aVAlso, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,
p208
aVwe wanted to try and bring other people
p209
aVbut we couldn't figure out how to do it.
p210
aVSo we opened the world\u2019s first flight school.
p211
aVThe rational for the world\u2019s first flight school
p212
aVgoes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say \u2014
p213
aVthey used to leave us alone when we were diving
p214
aVthese goofy little spherical things,
p215
aVbut when we started flying around
p216
aVin underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous \u2014
p217
aVthey would come up and say,
p218
aV"Do you have a license for that?"
p219
aVAnd then I\u2019d put my sunglasses on, the beard
p220
aVthat would all sprout out, and I would say,
p221
aV"I don\u2019t need no stinking license."
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aV"I write these stinking license," which I do.
p224
aVSo Bob Gelfond's around here \u2014
p225
aVbut somebody in the audience here has license number 20.
p226
aVThey\u2019re one of the first subsea aviators.
p227
aVSo we\u2019ve run two flight schools.
p228
aVWhere the hell that goes, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a lot of fun.
p229
aVWhat comes next in 30 seconds? I can\u2019t tell you.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut the patent for underwater flight \u2014
p232
aVKaren and I, we were looking at it,
p233
aVsome business partners wanted us to patent it \u2014
p234
aVwe weren\u2019t sure about that.
p235
aVWe\u2019ve decided we\u2019re just going to let that go.
p236
aVIt just seems wrong to try and patent \u2014
p237
aV(Applause)
p238
aV\u2014 the freedom for underwater flight.
p239
aVSo anybody who wants to copy us
p240
aVand come and join us, go for it.
p241
aVThe other thing is that we\u2019ve got much lower costs.
p242
aVWe developed some other technology
p243
aVcalled spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me
p244
aVto make an announcement here this morning:
p245
aVwe\u2019re going to be building a beautiful, little,
p246
aVsmall version of this \u2014 unmanned, super deep \u2014
p247
aVfor his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.
p248
aV(Applause)
p249
aVThank you.
