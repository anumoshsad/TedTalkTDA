VAll right, so let's take
p4
aVfour subjects that obviously go together:
p5
aVbig data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.
p6
aVRight?
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, the issue about tattoos is that,
p9
aVwithout a word, tattoos really do shout.
p10
aV[Beautiful]
p11
aV[Intriguing]
p12
aVSo you don't have to say a lot.
p13
aV[Allegiance]
p14
aV[Very intimate]
p15
aV[Serious mistakes]
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVAnd tattoos tell you a lot of stories.
p18
aVIf I can ask an indiscreet question,
p19
aVhow many of you have tattoos?
p20
aVA few, but not most.
p21
aVWhat happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,
p22
aVcell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,
p23
aVall these things you deal with every day
p24
aVturn out to be electronic tattoos?
p25
aVAnd what if they provide as much information
p26
aVabout who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?
p27
aa(lp28
VWhat's ended up happening over the past few decades
p29
aVis the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state
p30
aVor as a great celebrity
p31
aVis now being applied to you every day by all these people
p32
aVwho are Tweeting, blogging, following you,
p33
aVwatching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.
p34
aVAnd electronic tattoos also shout.
p35
aVAnd as you're thinking of the consequences of that,
p36
aVit's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,
p37
aVbecause it's not just the electronic tattoos,
p38
aVit's facial recognition that's getting really good.
p39
aVSo you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,
p40
aValthough, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter)
p41
aVBut that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,
p42
aVtake a picture, say, of this guy right here,
p43
aVget the name, and download all the records
p44
aVbefore you utter a word or speak to somebody,
p45
aVbecause everybody turns out to be
p46
aVabsolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd so there's companies like face.com that now have
p49
aVabout 18 billion faces online.
p50
aVHere's what happened to this company.
p51
aV[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...]
p52
aVThere are other companies that will place a camera
p53
aVlike this \u2014 this has nothing to do with Facebook \u2014
p54
aVthey take your picture, they tie it to the social media,
p55
aVthey figure out you really like to wear black dresses,
p56
aVso maybe the person in the store comes up and says,
p57
aV"Hey, we've got five black dresses
p58
aVthat would just look great on you."
p59
aa(lp60
VSo what if Andy was wrong?
p61
aVHere's Andy's theory.
p62
aV[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]
p63
aVWhat if we flip this?
p64
aVWhat if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)
p65
aVWell, then, because of electronic tattoos,
p66
aVmaybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,
p67
aVbecause these tattoos will live
p68
aVfar longer than our bodies will.
p69
aVAnd if that's true, then what we want to do
p70
aVis we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks
p71
aVand one lesson from a Latin American.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhy the Greeks?
p74
aVWell, the Greeks thought about what happens
p75
aVwhen gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo lesson number one: Sisyphus.
p78
aVRemember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time
p79
aVto roll this rock up, it would roll back down,
p80
aVroll back up, roll back down.
p81
aVIt's a little like your reputation.
p82
aVOnce you get that electronic tattoo,
p83
aVyou're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,
p84
aVso as you go through this stuff,
p85
aVjust be careful what you post.
p86
aa(lp87
VMyth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,
p88
aVcharming to be around, great partier, great singer,
p89
aVloses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,
p90
aVonly person to charm his way into the underworld,
p91
aVcharms the gods of the underworld,
p92
aVthey release his beauty on the condition
p93
aVhe never look at her until they're out.
p94
aVSo he's walking out and walking out and walking out
p95
aVand he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.
p96
aVWith all this data out here, it might be a good idea
p97
aVnot to look too far into the past of those you love.
p98
aa(lp99
VLesson number three: Atalanta.
p100
aVGreatest runner. She would challenge anybody.
p101
aVIf you won, she would marry you.
p102
aVIf you lost, you died.
p103
aVHow did Hippomenes beat her?
p104
aVWell, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,
p105
aVand she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.
p106
aVShe'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.
p107
aVShe kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.
p108
aVJust remember the purpose as all these little golden apples
p109
aVcome and reach you and you want to post about them
p110
aVor tweet about them or send a late-night message.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd then, of course, there's Narcissus.
p113
aVNobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVBut as you're thinking about Narcissus,
p116
aVjust don't fall in love with your own reflection.
p117
aa(lp118
VLast lesson, from a Latin American:
p119
aVThis is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.
p120
aVWhen he was threatened by the thugs
p121
aVof the Argentine military junta,
p122
aVhe came back and said, "Oh, come on,
p123
aVhow else can you threaten, other than with death?"
p124
aVThe interesting thing, the original thing,
p125
aVwould be to threaten somebody with immortality.
p126
aVAnd that, of course, is what we are all
p127
aVnow threatened with today because of electronic tattoos.
p128
