VI'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.
p4
aa(lp5
VBefore I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:
p6
aVWhy does poverty exist?
p7
aVI mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.
p8
aVWe all live in the same planet,
p9
aVbut there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.
p10
aVAnd I think \u2014 so I want to throw a perspective that I have,
p11
aVso that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,
p12
aVto see whether it's contributing or \u2014
p13
aVcontributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.
p14
aa(lp15
VRich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.
p16
aVAnd by and large, this has failed.
p17
aVAnd you can see this book,
p18
aVwritten by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,
p19
aVand he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.
p20
aVBy and large, it did not work.
p21
aVSo the question is, why is that?
p22
aa(lp23
VIn my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.
p24
aVI mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,
p25
aVand they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,
p26
aVright across the street from here.
p27
aVSo my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,
p28
aVwhere citizens were empowered by technologies.
p29
aVAnd they demanded authorities from \u2014
p30
aVto come down from their high horses.
p31
aVAnd in the end, there's better bargaining
p32
aVbetween the authorities and citizens,
p33
aVand democracies, capitalism \u2014 everything else flourished.
p34
aVAnd so you can see, the real process of \u2014
p35
aVand this is backed up by this 500-page book \u2014
p36
aVthat the authorities came down and citizens got up.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut if you look, if you have that perspective,
p39
aVthen you can see what happened in the last 60 years.
p40
aVAid actually did the opposite.
p41
aVIt empowered authorities,
p42
aVand, as a result, marginalized citizens.
p43
aVThe authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen
p44
aVso that they could tax people
p45
aVand make more money for to run their business.
p46
aVBecause they were getting it from abroad.
p47
aVAnd in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,
p48
aVwhere citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes \u2014
p49
aVNigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.
p50
aVBecause the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.
p51
aVIt empowers authorities, without activating the citizens \u2014
p52
aVtheir hands, legs, brains, what have you.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries
p55
aVis to recognize that economic development is of the people,
p56
aVby the people, for the people.
p57
aVAnd that is the real network effect.
p58
aVIf citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,
p59
aVso that their voices are heard,
p60
aVso then things would improve.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,
p63
aVthe World Bank, is an organization of the government,
p64
aVby the government, for the governments.
p65
aVJust see the contrast.
p66
aVAnd that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.
p67
aa(lp68
VOf course, how would you empower citizens?
p69
aVThere could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.
p70
aVRecently "The Economist" recognized this,
p71
aVbut I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,
p72
aVand that's what I've been working on.
p73
aVSo 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe had \u2014 quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.
p76
aVAnd we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;
p77
aVwe could update each other more often.
p78
aVBut one time it broke down.
p79
aVAnd it reminded me of a day in 1971.
p80
aVThere was a war going on in my country.
p81
aVAnd my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,
p82
aVto a remote rural area where it was safer.
p83
aVAnd one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.
p84
aVAnd I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.
p85
aVAnd he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.
p86
aVSo I had another unproductive day.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,
p89
aVI put those two experiences together side by side,
p90
aVand basically concluded that connectivity is productivity \u2014
p91
aVwhether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.
p92
aVSo naturally, I \u2014 the implication of that is
p93
aVthat the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
p94
aVAnd if that's the case, then the question is
p95
aVhow many telephones did we have at that time?
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh
p98
aVfor every 500 people.
p99
aVAnd all those phones were in the few urban places.
p100
aVThe vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,
p101
aVthere were no telephones.
p102
aVSo just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,
p103
aVjust like I wasted a day.
p104
aVIf you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,
p105
aVwhatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
p106
aVAnd after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,
p107
aVis their days are the same length: 24 hours.
p108
aVSo if you lose that precious resource,
p109
aVwhere you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,
p110
aVthat's a huge waste.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I started looking for any evidence that \u2014
p113
aVdoes connectivity really increase productivity?
p114
aVAnd I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,
p115
aVwhich is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.
p116
aVThey show an interesting thing.
p117
aVThat you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.
p118
aVSo the United States or the UK would be here, outside.
p119
aVAnd so the impact of one new telephone,
p120
aVwhich is on the vertical axis, is very little.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,
p123
aVlet's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,
p124
aVthen the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.
p125
aVThe question was,
p126
aVhow much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?
p127
aVIt turns out: 2,000 dollars.
p128
aVSo if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,
p129
aVand if 5,000 dollars every year \u2014 so that's 50,000 dollars.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo obviously this was a gadget to have.
p132
aVAnd of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,
p133
aVbecause there's a digital revolution going on,
p134
aVthen it would be even more dramatic.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd I knew a little economics by then \u2014
p137
aVit says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.
p138
aVBut how would you specialize?
p139
aVLet's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.
p140
aVAnd Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.
p141
aVSo the point is that we could only \u2014 the only way we could depend on each other,
p142
aVis if we can connect with each other.
p143
aVAnd if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.
p146
aVBut in order to expand that, you need a river,
p147
aVor you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.
p148
aVBut in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.
p149
aVAnd that leads to specialization.
p150
aVThat leads to productivity.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo the question was, I started looking at this issue,
p153
aVand going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.
p154
aVThere were a lot of reasons people told me
p155
aVwhy we don't have enough telephones.
p156
aVAnd one of them is the lacking buying power.
p157
aVPoor people apparently don't have the power to buy.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?
p160
aVI mean, in America, people buy cars,
p161
aVand they put very little money down.
p162
aVThey get a car, and they go to work.
p163
aVThe work pays them a salary;
p164
aVthe salary allows them to pay for the car over time.
p165
aVThe car pays for itself.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo if the telephone is a production tool,
p168
aVthen we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.
p169
aVAnd of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?
p170
aVSo then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?
p171
aVIn the United States, we have \u2014 everybody needs a banking service,
p172
aVbut very few of us are trying to buy a bank.
p173
aVSo it's \u2014 a bank tends to serve a whole community.
p174
aVSo we could do that for telephones.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:
p177
aVfood, clothing, shelter, whatever.
p178
aVBut again, it's very paternalistic.
p179
aVYou should be raising income
p180
aVand let people decide what they want to do with their money.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.
p183
aVSee, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.
p184
aVFor instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.
p185
aVbecause there were \u2014 there were people who had computers.
p186
aVThey had modems.
p187
aVThey had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.
p188
aVBut that's what's lacking in a poor country.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,
p191
aVfew banks to collect bills, etc.
p192
aVBut that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,
p193
aVand had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.
p194
aVAnd they had these branches.
p195
aVI thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd anyway, to cut the time short \u2014 so I started \u2014
p198
aVI first went to them and said,
p199
aV"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."
p200
aVBut you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,
p201
aVso they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,
p202
aVbut this was one of the reasons \u2014 they had to be.
p203
aVAnd so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,
p204
aVand then to be \u2014 and rock the boat.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo I started focusing. What is it that they really do?
p207
aVSo what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.
p208
aVShe typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.
p209
aVAnd she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.
p210
aVAnd this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.
p213
aVBecause some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,
p214
aVget a phone and have the phone for everybody.
p215
aVAnd it's a business for her.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,
p218
aV"It's a little crazy, but logical.
p219
aVIf you think it can be done, come and make it happen."
p220
aVSo I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.
p221
aVI created a company in America called Gonofone,
p222
aVwhich in Bengali means "people's phone."
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd angel investors in America put in money into that.
p225
aVI flew around the world.
p226
aVAfter about a million \u2014 I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,
p227
aVbecause I was not only trying to go to a poor country,
p228
aVI was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
p229
aa(lp230
VAfter about a million miles, and a meaningful \u2014
p231
aVa substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and \u2014
p232
aVwhich involved the Norwegian telephone company,
p233
aVwhich provided the know-how,
p234
aVand the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
p235
aa(lp236
VTo make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
p237
aVYou can see it's pretty much covered.
p238
aVEven in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.
p239
aVBut we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year
p240
aVto extend that coverage.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, about that cow model I talked about.
p243
aVThere are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services
p244
aVin their neighborhoods.
p245
aVAnd it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd these phones are generating
p248
aVabout 100 million dollars for the company.
p249
aVAnd two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.
p252
aVIt increases income, improves welfare, etc.
p253
aVAnd the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,
p254
aVwith 3.5 million subscribers,
p255
aV115,000 of these phones I talked about \u2014
p256
aVthat produces about a third of the traffic in the network.
p257
aVAnd 2004, the net profit, after taxes \u2014
p258
aVvery serious taxes \u2014 was 120 million dollars.
p259
aVAnd the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd again, here are some of the lessons.
p262
aV"The government needs to provide economically viable services."
p263
aVActually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
p264
aV"Governments need to subsidize private companies."
p265
aVThis is what some people think.
p266
aVAnd actually, private companies help governments with taxes.
p267
aV"Poor people are recipients."
p268
aVPoor people are a resource.
p269
aV"Services cost too much for the poor."
p270
aVTheir involvement reduces the cost.
p271
aV"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."
p272
aVThey are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
p273
aVI've been very surprised.
p274
aVMost of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.
p275
aV"Poor countries need aid."
p276
aVBusinesses \u2014 this one company has raised the \u2014
p277
aVif the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company
p278
aVis raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.
p279
aVAnd as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,
p280
aVaid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.
p283
aVHe has produced some power generators,
p284
aVwhich we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,
p285
aVin two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,
p286
aVwhich is running these generators.
p287
aVAnd each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.
p288
aVIt's just an experiment.
p289
aVWe don't know how far it will go,
p290
aVbut it's going on.
