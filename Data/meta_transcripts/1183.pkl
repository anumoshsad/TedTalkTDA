VA few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut,
p4
aVso I decided to follow in the footsteps
p5
aVof the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,
p6
aVand try something new for 30 days.
p7
aVThe idea is actually pretty simple.
p8
aVThink about something you've always wanted to add to your life
p9
aVand try it for the next 30 days.
p10
aVIt turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time
p11
aVto add a new habit or subtract a habit \u2014
p12
aVlike watching the news \u2014
p13
aVfrom your life.
p14
aa(lp15
VThere's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.
p16
aVThe first was,
p17
aVinstead of the months flying by, forgotten,
p18
aVthe time was much more memorable.
p19
aVThis was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.
p20
aVAnd I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day.
p21
aVI also noticed
p22
aVthat as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges,
p23
aVmy self-confidence grew.
p24
aVI went from desk-dwelling computer nerd
p25
aVto the kind of guy who bikes to work.
p26
aVFor fun!
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VEven last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro,
p31
aVthe highest mountain in Africa.
p32
aVI would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
p33
aa(lp34
VI also figured out that if you really want something badly enough,
p35
aVyou can do anything for 30 days.
p36
aVHave you ever wanted to write a novel?
p37
aVEvery November,
p38
aVtens of thousands of people
p39
aVtry to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch,
p40
aVin 30 days.
p41
aVIt turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day
p42
aVfor a month.
p43
aVSo I did.
p44
aVBy the way, the secret is not to go to sleep
p45
aVuntil you've written your words for the day.
p46
aVYou might be sleep-deprived,
p47
aVbut you'll finish your novel.
p48
aVNow is my book the next great American novel?
p49
aVNo. I wrote it in a month.
p50
aVIt's awful.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VBut for the rest of my life,
p55
aVif I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,
p56
aVI don't have to say,
p57
aV"I'm a computer scientist."
p58
aVNo, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo here's one last thing I'd like to mention.
p63
aVI learned that when I made small, sustainable changes,
p64
aVthings I could keep doing,
p65
aVthey were more likely to stick.
p66
aVThere's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges.
p67
aVIn fact, they're a ton of fun.
p68
aVBut they're less likely to stick.
p69
aVWhen I gave up sugar for 30 days,
p70
aVday 31 looked like this.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo here's my question to you:
p75
aVWhat are you waiting for?
p76
aVI guarantee you the next 30 days
p77
aVare going to pass whether you like it or not,
p78
aVso why not think about something you have always wanted to try
p79
aVand give it a shot!
p80
aVFor the next 30 days.
p81
aa(lp82
VThanks.
