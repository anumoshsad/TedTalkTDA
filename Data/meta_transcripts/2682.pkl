VSo I'm here to talk to you about the walkable city.
p4
aVWhat is the walkable city?
p5
aVWell, for want of a better definition,
p6
aVit's a city in which the car is an optional instrument of freedom,
p7
aVrather than a prosthetic device.
p8
aVAnd I'd like to talk about why we need the walkable city,
p9
aVand I'd like to talk about how to do the walkable city.
p10
aa(lp11
VMost of the talks I give these days are about why we need it,
p12
aVbut you guys are smart.
p13
aVAnd also I gave that talk exactly a month ago,
p14
aVand you can see it at TED.com.
p15
aVSo today I want to talk about how to do it.
p16
aVIn a lot of time thinking about this,
p17
aVI've come up with what I call the general theory of walkability.
p18
aVA bit of a pretentious term, it's a little tongue-in-cheek,
p19
aVbut it's something I've thought about for a long time,
p20
aVand I'd like to share what I think I've figured out.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn the American city, the typical American city \u2014
p23
aVthe typical American city is not Washington, DC,
p24
aVor New York, or San Francisco;
p25
aVit's Grand Rapids or Cedar Rapids or Memphis \u2014
p26
aVin the typical American city in which most people own cars
p27
aVand the temptation is to drive them all the time,
p28
aVif you're going to get them to walk, then you have to offer a walk
p29
aVthat's as good as a drive or better.
p30
aVWhat does that mean?
p31
aVIt means you need to offer four things simultaneously:
p32
aVthere needs to be a proper reason to walk,
p33
aVthe walk has to be safe and feel safe,
p34
aVthe walk has to be comfortable
p35
aVand the walk has to be interesting.
p36
aVYou need to do all four of these things simultaneously,
p37
aVand that's the structure of my talk today,
p38
aVto take you through each of those.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe reason to walk is a story I learned from my mentors,
p41
aVAndrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,
p42
aVthe founders of the New Urbanism movement.
p43
aVAnd I should say half the slides and half of my talk today
p44
aVI learned from them.
p45
aVIt's the story of planning,
p46
aVthe story of the formation of the planning profession.
p47
aVWhen in the 19th century people were choking
p48
aVfrom the soot of the dark, satanic mills,
p49
aVthe planners said, hey, let's move the housing away from the mills.
p50
aVAnd lifespans increased immediately, dramatically,
p51
aVand we like to say
p52
aVthe planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo there's the onset of what we call Euclidean zoning,
p55
aVthe separation of the landscape into large areas of single use.
p56
aVAnd typically when I arrive in a city to do a plan,
p57
aVa plan like this already awaits me on the property that I'm looking at.
p58
aVAnd all a plan like this guarantees
p59
aVis that you will not have a walkable city,
p60
aVbecause nothing is located near anything else.
p61
aVThe alternative, of course, is our most walkable city,
p62
aVand I like to say, you know, this is a Rothko,
p63
aVand this is a Seurat.
p64
aVIt's just a different way \u2014 he was the pointilist \u2014
p65
aVit's a different way of making places.
p66
aVAnd even this map of Manhattan is a bit misleading
p67
aVbecause the red color is uses that are mixed vertically.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this is the big story of the New Urbanists \u2014
p70
aVto acknowledge that there are only two ways
p71
aVthat have been tested by the thousands
p72
aVto build communities, in the world and throughout history.
p73
aVOne is the traditional neighborhood.
p74
aVYou see here several neighborhoods of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
p75
aVwhich is defined as being compact and being diverse \u2014
p76
aVplaces to live, work, shop, recreate, get educated \u2014
p77
aVall within walking distance.
p78
aVAnd it's defined as being walkable.
p79
aVThere are lots of small streets.
p80
aVEach one is comfortable to walk on.
p81
aVAnd we contrast that to the other way,
p82
aVan invention that happened after the Second World War,
p83
aVsuburban sprawl,
p84
aVclearly not compact, clearly not diverse, and it's not walkable,
p85
aVbecause so few of the streets connect,
p86
aVthat those streets that do connect become overburdened,
p87
aVand you wouldn't let your kid out on them.
p88
aVAnd I want to thank Alex Maclean, the aerial photographer,
p89
aVfor many of these beautiful pictures that I'm showing you today.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo it's fun to break sprawl down into its constituent parts.
p92
aVIt's so easy to understand,
p93
aVthe places where you only live, the places where you only work,
p94
aVthe places where you only shop,
p95
aVand our super-sized public institutions.
p96
aVSchools get bigger and bigger,
p97
aVand therefore, further and further from each other.
p98
aVAnd the ratio of the size of the parking lot
p99
aVto the size of the school
p100
aVtells you all you need to know,
p101
aVwhich is that no child has ever walked to this school,
p102
aVno child will ever walk to this school.
p103
aVThe seniors and juniors are driving the freshmen and the sophomores,
p104
aVand of course we have the crash statistics to prove it.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd then the super-sizing of our other civic institutions
p107
aVlike playing fields \u2014
p108
aVit's wonderful that Westin in the Ft. Lauderdale area
p109
aVhas eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds
p110
aVand 20 tennis courts,
p111
aVbut look at the road that takes you to that location,
p112
aVand would you let your child bike on it?
p113
aVAnd this is why we have the soccer mom now.
p114
aVWhen I was young, I had one soccer field,
p115
aVone baseball diamond and one tennis court,
p116
aVbut I could walk to it, because it was in my neighborhood.
p117
aa(lp118
VThen the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count:
p119
aVif you're going to separate everything from everything else
p120
aVand reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure,
p121
aVthen this is what your landscape begins to look like.
p122
aVThe main message here is:
p123
aVif you want to have a walkable city, you can't start with the sprawl model.
p124
aVyou need the bones of an urban model.
p125
aVThis is the outcome of that form of design,
p126
aVas is this.
p127
aVAnd this is something that a lot of Americans want.
p128
aVBut we have to understand it's a two-part American dream.
p129
aVIf you're dreaming for this,
p130
aVyou're also going to be dreaming of this, often to absurd extremes,
p131
aVwhen we build our landscape to accommodate cars first.
p132
aVAnd the experience of being in these places \u2014
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is not Photoshopped.
p137
aVWalter Kulash took this slide.
p138
aVIt's in Panama City.
p139
aVThis is a real place.
p140
aVAnd being a driver can be a bit of a nuisance,
p141
aVand being a pedestrian can be a bit of a nuisance
p142
aVin these places.
p143
aVThis is a slide that epidemiologists have been showing for some time now,
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VThe fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot
p148
aVto take the escalator to the treadmill
p149
aVshows that we're doing something wrong.
p150
aVBut we know how to do it better.
p151
aa(lp152
VHere are the two models contrasted.
p153
aVI show this slide,
p154
aVwhich has been a formative document of the New Urbanism now
p155
aVfor almost 30 years,
p156
aVto show that sprawl and the traditional neighborhood contain the same things.
p157
aVIt's just how big are they,
p158
aVhow close are they to each other,
p159
aVhow are they interspersed together
p160
aVand do you have a street network, rather than a cul-de-sac
p161
aVor a collector system of streets?
p162
aa(lp163
VSo when we look at a downtown area,
p164
aVat a place that has a hope of being walkable,
p165
aVand mostly that's our downtowns in America's cities
p166
aVand towns and villages,
p167
aVwe look at them and say we want the proper balance of uses.
p168
aVSo what is missing or underrepresented?
p169
aVAnd again, in the typical American cities in which most Americans live,
p170
aVit is housing that is lacking.
p171
aVThe jobs-to-housing balance is off.
p172
aVAnd you find that when you bring housing back,
p173
aVthese other things start to come back too,
p174
aVand housing is usually first among those things.
p175
aVAnd, of course, the thing that shows up last and eventually
p176
aVis the schools,
p177
aVbecause the people have to move in,
p178
aVthe young pioneers have to move in, get older, have kids
p179
aVand fight, and then the schools get pretty good eventually.
p180
aa(lp181
VThe other part of this part,
p182
aVthe useful city part,
p183
aVis transit,
p184
aVand you can have a perfectly walkable neighborhood without it.
p185
aVBut perfectly walkable cities require transit,
p186
aVbecause if you don't have access to the whole city as a pedestrian,
p187
aVthen you get a car,
p188
aVand if you get a car,
p189
aVthe city begins to reshape itself around your needs,
p190
aVand the streets get wider and the parking lots get bigger
p191
aVand you no longer have a walkable city.
p192
aVSo transit is essential.
p193
aVBut every transit experience, every transit trip,
p194
aVbegins or ends as a walk,
p195
aVand so we have to remember to build walkability around our transit stations.
p196
aa(lp197
VNext category, the biggest one, is the safe walk.
p198
aVIt's what most walkability experts talk about.
p199
aVIt is essential, but alone not enough to get people to walk.
p200
aVAnd there are so many moving parts that add up to a walkable city.
p201
aa(lp202
VThe first is block size.
p203
aVThis is Portland, Oregon,
p204
aVfamously 200-foot blocks, famously walkable.
p205
aVThis is Salt Lake City,
p206
aVfamously 600-foot blocks,
p207
aVfamously unwalkable.
p208
aVIf you look at the two, it's almost like two different planets,
p209
aVbut these places were both built by humans
p210
aVand in fact, the story is that when you have a 200-foot block city,
p211
aVyou can have a two-lane city,
p212
aVor a two-to-four lane city,
p213
aVand a 600-foot block city is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.
p214
aVThese are the crash statistics.
p215
aVWhen you double the block size \u2014
p216
aVthis was a study of 24 California cities \u2014
p217
aVwhen you double the block size,
p218
aVyou almost quadruple the number of fatal accidents
p219
aVon non-highway streets.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo how many lanes do we have?
p222
aVThis is where I'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet,
p223
aVwhich is to remind you about induced demand.
p224
aVInduced demand applies both to highways and to city streets.
p225
aVAnd induced demand tells us that when we widen the streets
p226
aVto accept the congestion that we're anticipating,
p227
aVor the additional trips that we're anticipating
p228
aVin congested systems, it is principally that congestion
p229
aVthat is constraining demand,
p230
aVand so that the widening comes,
p231
aVand there are all of these latent trips that are ready to happen.
p232
aVPeople move further from work
p233
aVand make other choices about when they commute,
p234
aVand those lanes fill up very quickly with traffic,
p235
aVso we widen the street again, and they fill up again.
p236
aVAnd we've learned that in congested systems,
p237
aVwe cannot satisfy the automobile.
p238
aa(lp239
VThis is from Newsweek Magazine \u2014 hardly an esoteric publication:
p240
aV"Today's engineers acknowledge
p241
aVthat building new roads usually makes traffic worse."
p242
aVMy response to reading this was, may I please meet some of these engineers,
p243
aVbecause these are not the ones that I \u2014
p244
aVthere are great exceptions that I'm working with now \u2014
p245
aVbut these are not the engineers one typically meets working in a city,
p246
aVwhere they say, "Oh, that road is too crowded, we need to add a lane."
p247
aVSo you add a lane, and the traffic comes,
p248
aVand they say, "See, I told you we needed that lane."
p249
aVThis applies both to highways and to city streets if they're congested.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut the amazing thing about most American cities that I work in,
p252
aVthe more typical cities,
p253
aVis that they have a lot of streets that are actually oversized
p254
aVfor the congestion they're currently experiencing.
p255
aVThis was the case in Oklahoma City,
p256
aVwhen the mayor came running to me, very upset,
p257
aVbecause they were named in Prevention Magazine
p258
aVthe worst city for pedestrians in the entire country.
p259
aVNow that can't possibly be true,
p260
aVbut it certainly is enough to make a mayor do something about it.
p261
aVWe did a walkability study,
p262
aVand what we found, looking at the car counts on the street \u2014
p263
aVthese are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts
p264
aVand we know that two lanes can handle 10,000 cars per day.
p265
aVLook at these numbers \u2014 they're all near or under 10,000 cars,
p266
aVand these were the streets that were designated
p267
aVin the new downtown plan
p268
aVto be four lanes to six lanes wide.
p269
aVSo you had a fundamental disconnect between the number of lanes
p270
aVand the number of cars that wanted to use them.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo it was my job to redesign every street in the downtown
p273
aVfrom curb face to curb face,
p274
aVand we did it for 50 blocks of streets,
p275
aVand we're rebuilding it now.
p276
aVSo a typical oversized street to nowhere
p277
aVis being narrowed, and now under construction,
p278
aVand the project is half done.
p279
aVThe typical street like this, you know,
p280
aVwhen you do that, you find room for medians.
p281
aVYou find room for bike lanes.
p282
aVWe've doubled the amount of on-street parking.
p283
aVWe've added a full bike network where one didn't exist before.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut not everyone has the money that Oklahoma City has,
p286
aVbecause they have an extraction economy that's doing quite well.
p287
aVThe typical city is more like Cedar Rapids,
p288
aVwhere they have an all four-lane system, half one-way system.
p289
aVAnd it's a little hard to see,
p290
aVbut what we've done \u2014 what we're doing; it's in process right now,
p291
aVit's in engineering right now \u2014
p292
aVis turning an all four-lane system, half one-way
p293
aVinto an all two-lane system, all two-way,
p294
aVand in so doing, we're adding 70 percent more on-street parking,
p295
aVwhich the merchants love,
p296
aVand it protects the sidewalk.
p297
aVThat parking makes the sidewalk safe,
p298
aVand we're adding a much more robust bicycle network.
p299
aa(lp300
VThen the lanes themselves. How wide are they?
p301
aVThat's really important.
p302
aVThe standards have changed such that, as Andrés Duany says,
p303
aVthe typical road to a subdivision in America
p304
aVallows you to see the curvature of the Earth.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is a subdivision outside of Washington from the 1960s.
p309
aVLook very carefully at the width of the streets.
p310
aVThis is a subdivision from the 1980s.
p311
aV1960s, 1980s.
p312
aVThe standards have changed to such a degree
p313
aVthat my old neighborhood of South Beach,
p314
aVwhen it was time to fix the street that wasn't draining properly,
p315
aVthey had to widen it and take away half our sidewalk,
p316
aVbecause the standards were wider.
p317
aVPeople go faster on wider streets.
p318
aVPeople know this.
p319
aVThe engineers deny it, but the citizens know it,
p320
aVso that in Birmingham, Michigan, they fight for narrower streets.
p321
aVPortland, Oregon, famously walkable,
p322
aVinstituted its "Skinny Streets" program in its residential neighborhood.
p323
aVWe know that skinny streets are safer.
p324
aVThe developer Vince Graham, in his project I'On,
p325
aVwhich we worked on in South Carolina,
p326
aVhe goes to conferences and he shows his amazing 22-foot roads.
p327
aVThese are two-way roads, very narrow rights of way,
p328
aVand he shows this well-known philosopher,
p329
aVwho said, "Broad is the road that leads to destruction ...
p330
aVnarrow is the road that leads to life."
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VThis plays very well in the South.
p337
aa(lp338
VNow: bicycles.
p339
aVBicycles and bicycling are the current revolution underway
p340
aVin only some American cities.
p341
aVBut where you build it, they come.
p342
aVAs a planner, I hate to say that, but the one thing I can say
p343
aVis that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure.
p344
aVI asked my friend Tom Brennan from Nelson\u005cNygaard in Portland
p345
aVto send me some pictures of the Portland bike commute.
p346
aVHe sent me this. I said, "Was that bike to work day?"
p347
aVHe said, "No, that was Tuesday."
p348
aVWhen you do what Portland did and spend money on bicycle infrastructure \u2014
p349
aVNew York City has doubled the number of bikers in it several times now
p350
aVby painting these bright green lanes.
p351
aVEven automotive cities like Long Beach, California:
p352
aVvast uptick in the number of bikers based on the infrastructure.
p353
aVAnd of course, what really does it,
p354
aVif you know 15th Street here in Washington, DC \u2014
p355
aVplease meet Rahm Emanuel's new bike lanes in Chicago,
p356
aVthe buffered lane, the parallel parking pulled off the curb,
p357
aVthe bikes between the parked cars and the curb \u2014
p358
aVthese mint cyclists.
p359
aVIf, however, as in Pasadena, every lane is a bike lane,
p360
aVthen no lane is a bike lane.
p361
aVAnd this is the only bicyclist that I met in Pasadena, so ...
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VThe parallel parking I mentioned \u2014
p366
aVit's an essential barrier of steel
p367
aVthat protects the curb and pedestrians from moving vehicles.
p368
aVThis is Ft. Lauderdale; one side of the street, you can park,
p369
aVthe other side of the street, you can't.
p370
aVThis is happy hour on the parking side.
p371
aVThis is sad hour on the other side.
p372
aVAnd then the trees themselves slow cars down.
p373
aVThey move slower when trees are next to the road,
p374
aVand, of course, sometimes they slow down very quickly.
p375
aVAll the little details \u2014 the curb return radius.
p376
aVIs it one foot or is it 40 feet?
p377
aVHow swoopy is that curb to determine how fast the car goes
p378
aVand how much room you have to cross.
p379
aVAnd then I love this, because this is objective journalism.
p380
aV"Some say the entrance to CityCenter is not inviting to pedestrians."
p381
aVWhen every aspect of the landscape is swoopy,
p382
aVis aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,
p383
aVit says: "This is a vehicular place."
p384
aVSo no one detail, no one speciality, can be allowed to set the stage.
p385
aVAnd here, you know, this street:
p386
aVyes, it will drain within a minute of the hundred-year storm,
p387
aVbut this poor woman has to mount the curb every day.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo then quickly, the comfortable walk has to do with the fact
p390
aVthat all animals seek, simultaneously, prospect and refuge.
p391
aVWe want to be able to see our predators,
p392
aVbut we also want to feel that our flanks are covered.
p393
aVAnd so we're drawn to places that have good edges,
p394
aVand if you don't supply the edges, people won't want to be there.
p395
aVWhat's the proper ratio of height to width?
p396
aVIs it one to one? Three to one?
p397
aVIf you get beyond one to six, you're not very comfortable anymore.
p398
aVYou don't feel enclosed.
p399
aVNow, six to one in Salzburg can be perfectly delightful.
p400
aVThe opposite of Salzburg is Houston.
p401
aVThe point being the parking lot is the principal problem here.
p402
aVHowever, missing teeth, those empty lots can be issues as well,
p403
aVand if you have a missing corner because of an outdated zoning code,
p404
aVthen you could have a missing nose in your neighborhood.
p405
aVThat's what we had in my neighborhood.
p406
aVThis was the zoning code that said I couldn't build on that site.
p407
aVAs you may know, Washington, DC is now changing its zoning
p408
aVto allow sites like this to become sites like this.
p409
aVWe needed a lot of variances to do that.
p410
aVTriangular houses can be interesting to build,
p411
aVbut if you get one built, people generally like it.
p412
aVSo you've got to fill those missing noses.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd then, finally, the interesting walk:
p415
aVsigns of humanity.
p416
aVWe are among the social primates.
p417
aVNothing interests us more than other people.
p418
aVWe want signs of people.
p419
aVSo the perfect one-to-one ratio, it's a great thing.
p420
aVThis is Grand Rapids, a very walkable city,
p421
aVbut nobody walks on this street
p422
aVthat connects the two best hotels together,
p423
aVbecause if on the left, you have an exposed parking deck,
p424
aVand on the right, you have a conference facility
p425
aVthat was apparently designed in admiration for that parking deck,
p426
