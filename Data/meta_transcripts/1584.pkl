VOne in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,
p4
aVso if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.
p5
aVYou. Yeah. (Laughter)
p6
aVWith the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)
p7
aVYou know who you are.
p8
aVActually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)
p9
aVThat's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VI am one of the one in four. Thank you.
p12
aVI think I inherit it from my mother, who,
p13
aVused to crawl around the house on all fours.
p14
aVShe had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two
p15
aVtied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)
p16
aVAnd she would crawl around behind me going,
p17
aV"Who brings footprints into a building?!"
p18
aVSo that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.
p19
aVSo before I start, I would like to thank
p20
aVthe makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,
p21
aVbecause without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo how did it start?
p24
aVMy mental illness \u2014 well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.
p25
aVWhat am I going to talk about? Okay.
p26
aVI always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,
p27
aVit would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque
p28
aVexistentialist revelation,
p29
aVor that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)
p30
aVBut that's not what happened. I had my breakdown
p31
aVduring my daughter's sports day.
p32
aVThere were all the parents sitting in a parking lot
p33
aVeating food out of the back of their car \u2014 only the English \u2014
p34
aVeating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)
p35
aVLord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,
p36
aVand then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,
p37
aVand all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)
p38
aV"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"
p39
aVAnd all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,
p40
aVeverybody except for my daughter, who was just standing
p41
aVat the starting line, just waving,
p42
aVbecause she didn't know she was supposed to run.
p43
aVSo I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up
p44
aVI found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,
p45
aVI realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)
p46
aVBecause they became my only friends, they became my friends,
p47
aVbecause very few people that I knew \u2014 Well, I wasn't
p48
aVsent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg
p49
aVor I was with child I would have been inundated,
p50
aVbut all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.
p51
aVPerk up.
p52
aVBecause I didn't think of that. (Laughter)
p53
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VBecause, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,
p56
aVthis one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,
p57
aVbecause your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,
p58
aVshow me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,
p59
aVso you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,
p60
aV"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."
p61
aVSo you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,
p62
aVyou hear about a thousand \u2014 100,000 abusive voices,
p63
aVlike if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.
p64
aVBut we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,
p65
aVthere are no voices in your head.
p66
aVYou know that when you have those abusive voices,
p67
aVall those little neurons get together and in that little gap
p68
aVyou get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,
p69
aVand if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,
p70
aVyou might have yourself depression.
p71
aVOh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
p72
aVIf you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,
p73
aVits little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive
p74
aVthat the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,
p75
aVso you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
p76
aVIf a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into
p77
aVsuch high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,
p78
aVso he just feels the horror over and over again.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo here's my question. My question is, how come
p81
aVwhen people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?
p82
aVHow come every other organ in your body can get sick
p83
aVand you get sympathy, except the brain?
p84
aa(lp85
VI'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,
p86
aVbecause I know you like that here at TED,
p87
aVso if you just give me a minute here, okay.
p88
aVOkay, let me just say, there's some good news.
p89
aVThere is some good news. First of all, let me say,
p90
aVwe've come a long, long way.
p91
aVWe started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,
p92
aVtiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.
p93
aVHere we go. (Laughter)
p94
aVThis little baby has a lot of horsepower.
p95
aVIt comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.
p96
aVWe've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.
p97
aVWe got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.
p98
aVHere we've got a little bit of long-term memory,
p99
aVso, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)
p100
aVSo actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons
p101
aVjust zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,
p102
aVzizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.
p103
aVI don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)
p104
aVSo, zizzing away, and so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p105
aVAnd for every one \u2014 I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.
p106
aVFor every one single neuron, you can actually have
p107
aVfrom 10,000 to 100,000 different connections
p108
aVor dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time
p109
aVyou learn something, or you have an experience,
p110
aVthat bush grows, you know, that bush of information.
p111
aVCan you imagine, every human being is carrying
p112
aVthat equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)
p113
aVGo figure.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.
p116
aVThis isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.
p117
aVWe are not equipped for the 21st century.
p118
aVEvolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,
p119
aVand for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,
p120
aVthey're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.
p121
aVBecause I'll show you where there might be a few glitches
p122
aVin evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.
p123
aVWhen we were ancient man \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p124
aVmillions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened
p125
aVby a predator, okay? \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p126
aVwe would \u2014 Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)
p127
aVThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p128
aVThank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline
p129
aVand our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,
p130
aVwe'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,
p131
aVand we'd go back to normal. Okay.
p132
aVSo the problem is, nowadays, with modern man\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p133
aVwhen we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical
p134
aVbut because we can't kill traffic wardens \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p135
aVor eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body
p136
aVover and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,
p137
aVa constant state. And here's another thing that happened.
p138
aVAbout 150,000 years ago, when language came online,
p139
aVwe started to put words to this constant emergency,
p140
aVso it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"
p141
aVwhich could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.
p142
aVOh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"
p143
aVSo you've got this nagging loop tape that goes
p144
aVover and over again that drives you insane, so,
p145
aVyou see what the problem is? What once made you safe
p146
aVnow drives you insane.
p147
aVI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.
p148
aVYour pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVSo kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)
p151
aVCompletely and utterly \u2014 so, screwed.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,
p154
aVand we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going
p155
aVto be one in four. It's going to be four in four
p156
aVwho are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.
p157
aVAnd while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?
p158
aVThank you. (Applause)
p159
aV(Applause) Thank you.
