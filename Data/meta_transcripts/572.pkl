VWhy do so many people reach success and then fail?
p4
aVOne of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.
p5
aVSo we do everything that leads up to success,
p6
aVbut then we get there. We figure we've made it,
p7
aVwe sit back in our comfort zone,
p8
aVand we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.
p9
aVAnd it doesn't take long to go downhill.
p10
aVAnd I can tell you this happens,
p11
aVbecause it happened to me.
p12
aa(lp13
VReaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.
p14
aVBut then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.
p15
aVI can just sit back and relax."
p16
aa(lp17
VReaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.
p18
aVBut then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.
p19
aVI don't need to improve any more."
p20
aa(lp21
VReaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.
p22
aVBecause I did all these simple things that led to ideas.
p23
aVBut then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy
p24
aVand I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.
p25
aVAnd the only thing that came was creative block.
p26
aVI couldn't come up with any ideas.
p27
aa(lp28
VReaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,
p29
aVand ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.
p30
aVAnd I got distracted by it.
p31
aVAnd suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,
p32
aVwhen I should have been talking to my clients.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd reaching success, I always did what I loved.
p35
aVBut then I got into stuff that I didn't love,
p36
aVlike management. I am the world's worst manager,
p37
aVbut I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,
p38
aVthe president of the company.
p39
aa(lp40
VWell, soon a black cloud formed over my head
p41
aVand here I was, outwardly very successful,
p42
aVbut inwardly very depressed.
p43
aVBut I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.
p44
aVI bought a fast car.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVIt didn't help.
p47
aVI was faster but just as depressed.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,
p50
aVI can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.
p51
aVIt's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.
p52
aVBut money can't buy happiness."
p53
aVHe said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."
p54
aVAnd he put me on anti-depressants.
p55
aVAnd yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,
p56
aVbecause I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd clients didn't call.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVBecause they could see I was no longer serving them,
p62
aVI was only serving myself.
p63
aVSo they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.
p66
aVMy partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.
p67
aVIt was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.
p68
aVAnd that was great.
p69
aVBecause with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I went back to doing the projects I loved.
p72
aVI had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,
p73
aVdid all the things that took me back up to success.
p74
aVBut it wasn't a quick trip.
p75
aVIt took seven years.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut in the end, business grew bigger than ever.
p78
aVAnd when I went back to following these eight principles,
p79
aVthe black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.
p80
aVAnd I woke up one day and I said,
p81
aV"I don't need Prozac anymore."
p82
aVAnd I threw it away and haven't needed it since.
p83
aa(lp84
VI learned that success isn't a one-way street.
p85
aVIt doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
p86
aVIt's a continuous journey.
p87
aVAnd if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"
p88
aVwe just keep following these eight principles,
p89
aVbecause that is not only how we achieve success,
p90
aVit's how we sustain it.
p91
aVSo here is to your continued success.
p92
aVThank you very much.
