VLet me start by asking you a question, just with a show of hands:
p4
aVWho has an iPhone?
p5
aVWho has an Android phone?
p6
aVWho has a Blackberry?
p7
aVWho will admit in public to having a Blackberry?
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd let me guess, how many of you,
p11
aVwhen you arrived here, like me, went and bought
p12
aVa pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?
p13
aVI'll bet you didn't even know
p14
aVyou're using African technology.
p15
aVPay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,
p16
aVpioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom
p17
aVa good 15 years ago,
p18
aVand now, like franchising,
p19
aVpay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces
p20
aVof economic activity in the world.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,
p23
aVwhich I think is the purest form,
p24
aVinnovation out of necessity.
p25
aVBut first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.
p26
aVYou don't have to put your hands up.
p27
aVThese are rhetorical.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhy did Nikola Tesla have to invent
p30
aVthe alternating current that powers the lights
p31
aVin this building or the city that we're in?
p32
aa(lp33
VWhy did Henry Ford have to invent the production line
p34
aVto produce these Fords that came in anything
p35
aVas long as they were black?
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos?
p38
aVBlank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,
p39
aVand in the background, you can see Robben Island.
p40
aVThis is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield
p41
aVis the most famous inventor you've never heard of.
p42
aVIn 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor
p43
aVin a small South African town called East London,
p44
aVand while he was watching his kids playing
p45
aVwith toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,
p46
aVhe had the idea for this.
p47
aVIt's a bit like a huge jumping jack,
p48
aVand they have used this in every harbor in the world
p49
aVas a breakwater.
p50
aVThe global shipping economy would not be possible
p51
aVwithout African technology like this.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo whenever you talk about Africa,
p54
aVyou have to put up this picture of the world from space,
p55
aVand people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent."
p56
aVActually, it isn't.
p57
aVWhat it is is a map of innovation.
p58
aVAnd it's really easy to see where innovation's going on.
p59
aVAll the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aV(Applause)
p62
aVAnd the reason it isn't is because everybody's
p63
aVwatching television or playing Angry Birds.
p64
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo where it's happening is in Africa.
p67
aVNow, this is real innovation,
p68
aVnot the way people have expropriated the word
p69
aVto talk about launching new products.
p70
aVThis is real innovation, and I define it as problem-solving.
p71
aVPeople are solving real problems in Africa.
p72
aVWhy? Because we have to.
p73
aVBecause we have real problems.
p74
aVAnd when we solve real problems for people,
p75
aVwe solve them for the rest of the world
p76
aVat the same time.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo in California, everybody's really excited
p79
aVabout a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone
p80
aVand you can swipe your credit card,
p81
aVand people say, "We've liberated the credit card
p82
aVfrom the point of sale terminal."
p83
aVFantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?
p84
aVIn Africa, we've been doing that for years,
p85
aVand we've been doing it on phones like this.
p86
aVThis is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,
p87
aVabout an hour south of Nairobi,
p88
aVand the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system
p89
aVthat's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa
p90
aVis that it works on phones like this.
p91
aVIt works on every single phone possible,
p92
aVbecause it uses SMS.
p93
aVYou can pay bills with it,  you can buy your groceries,
p94
aVyou can pay your kids' school fees,
p95
aVand I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVSomething like 25 million dollars a day
p98
aVis transacted through M-Pesa.
p99
aVForty percent of Kenya's GDP
p100
aVmoves through M-Pesa using phones like this.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd you think this is just a feature phone.
p103
aVActually it's the smartphone of Africa.
p104
aVIt's also a radio, and it's also a torch,
p105
aVand more than anything else,
p106
aVit has really superb battery life.
p107
aVWhy? Because that's what we need.
p108
aVWe have really severe energy problems in Africa.
p109
aVBy the way, you can update Facebook
p110
aVand send Gmail from a phone like this.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo we have found a way to use
p113
aVthe available technology to send money via M-Pesa,
p114
aVwhich is a bit like a check system
p115
aVfor the mobile age.
p116
aVI come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.
p117
aVIt's built on gold.
p118
aVThis is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.
p119
aVAnd the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile.
p120
aVIf you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked,
p121
aVfirst came the infrastructure,
p122
aVthen came the industry around it, the brothels \u2014
p123
aVit's a bit like the Internet today, right? \u2014
p124
aVand everything else that worked with it:
p125
aVbars, saloons, etc.
p126
aVThe gold of today is mobile,
p127
aVand mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo what are some of the things that you can do with it?
p130
aVWell, this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana,
p131
aVand what you do is you take medication,
p132
aVsomething that some people might spend their entire month's salary on,
p133
aVand you scratch off the code,
p134
aVand you send that to an SMS number,
p135
aVand it tells you if that is legitimate
p136
aVor if it's expired.
p137
aVReally simple, really effective, really life-saving.
p138
aVIn Kenya, there's a service called iCow,
p139
aVwhich just sends you really important information
p140
aVabout how to look after your dairy.
p141
aVThe dairy business in Kenya
p142
aVis a $463 million business,
p143
aVand the difference between a subsistence farmer
p144
aVand an abundance farmer
p145
aVis only a couple of liters of milk a day.
p146
aVAnd if you can do that, you can rise out of poverty.
p147
aVReally simple, using a basic phone.
p148
aVIf you don't have electricity, no problem!
p149
aVWe'll just make it out of old bicycle parts
p150
aVusing a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.
p151
aVThere's another great African that you've heard
p152
aVthat's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world.
p153
aVHe's also finding a way to reinvent solar power
p154
aVand the electricity industry in North America,
p155
aVand if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,
p156
aVhopefully in my lifetime.
p157
aVHe comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],
p158
aVabout 50 kilometers from where I live.
p159
aVSo back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,
p160
aVwhich means City of Gold.
p161
aVAnd not only is mobile the gold of today,
p162
aVI don't believe that the gold is under the ground.
p163
aVI believe we are the gold.
p164
aVLike you've heard the other economists say,
p165
aVwe are at the point where China was
p166
aVwhen its boom years began,
p167
aVand that's where we're going.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge.
p170
aVWell, of course it's happening at the edge,
p171
aVbecause in the middle, everybody's updating Facebook,
p172
aVor worse still, they're trying to understand
p173
aVFacebook's privacy settings.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVThis is not that catchy catchphrase.
p176
aVThis is innovation over the edge.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,
p179
aVbut actually it's mobile-only,
p180
aVso while everybody else is doing all of those things,
p181
aVwe're solving the world's problems.
p182
aVSo there's only one thing left to say.
p183
aa(lp184
V["You're welcome"] (Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
