VThere is nothing bigger or older than the universe.
p4
aVThe questions I would like to talk about are:
p5
aVone, where did we come from?
p6
aVHow did the universe come into being?
p7
aVAre we alone in the universe?
p8
aVIs there alien life out there?
p9
aVWhat is the future of the human race?
p10
aa(lp11
VUp until the 1920s,
p12
aVeveryone thought the universe was essentially static
p13
aVand unchanging in time.
p14
aVThen it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
p15
aVDistant galaxies were moving away from us.
p16
aVThis meant they must have been closer together in the past.
p17
aVIf we extrapolate back,
p18
aVwe find we must have all been on top of each other
p19
aVabout 15 billion years ago.
p20
aVThis was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut was there anything before the Big Bang?
p23
aVIf not, what created the universe?
p24
aVWhy did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?
p25
aVWe used to think that the theory of the universe
p26
aVcould be divided into two parts.
p27
aVFirst, there were the laws
p28
aVlike Maxwell's equations and general relativity
p29
aVthat determined the evolution of the universe,
p30
aVgiven its state over all of space at one time.
p31
aVAnd second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe have made good progress on the first part,
p34
aVand now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution
p35
aVin all but the most extreme conditions.
p36
aVBut until recently, we have had little idea
p37
aVabout the initial conditions for the universe.
p38
aVHowever, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions
p39
aVdepends on time and space being separate and distinct.
p40
aVUnder extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory
p41
aVallow time to behave like another dimension of space.
p42
aVThis removes the distinction between time and space,
p43
aVand means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.
p44
aVThe universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.
p45
aa(lp46
VMoreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe
p47
aVwas created in different states.
p48
aVThese predictions are in excellent agreement
p49
aVwith observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background,
p50
aVwhich is an imprint of the very early universe.
p51
aVWe think we have solved the mystery of creation.
p52
aVMaybe we should patent the universe
p53
aVand charge everyone royalties for their existence.
p54
aa(lp55
VI now turn to the second big question:
p56
aVare we alone, or is there other life in the universe?
p57
aVWe believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth,
p58
aVso it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets,
p59
aVof which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut we don't know how life first appeared.
p62
aVWe have two pieces of observational evidence
p63
aVon the probability of life appearing.
p64
aVThe first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.
p65
aVThe Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago
p66
aVand was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
p67
aVSo life appeared on Earth
p68
aVwithin half a billion years of it being possible,
p69
aVwhich is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime
p70
aVof a planet of Earth type.
p71
aVThis suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
p72
aVIf it was very low, one would have expected it
p73
aVto take most of the ten billion years available.
p74
aa(lp75
VOn the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.
p76
aVI am discounting the reports of UFOs.
p77
aVWhy would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?
p78
aVIf there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports
p79
aVand keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring,
p80
aVit seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.
p81
aVFurthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project,
p82
aVwe haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.
p83
aVThis probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations
p84
aVat our stage of development
p85
aVwithin a radius of a few hundred light years.
p86
aVIssuing an insurance policy
p87
aVagainst abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis brings me to the last of the big questions:
p90
aVthe future of the human race.
p91
aVIf we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy,
p92
aVwe should make sure we survive and continue.
p93
aVBut we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.
p94
aVOur population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth
p95
aVare growing exponentially,
p96
aValong with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
p97
aVBut our genetic code
p98
aVstill carries the selfish and aggressive instincts
p99
aVthat were of survival advantage in the past.
p100
aVIt will be difficult enough to avoid disaster
p101
aVin the next hundred years,
p102
aVlet alone the next thousand or million.
p103
aa(lp104
VOur only chance of long-term survival
p105
aVis not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth,
p106
aVbut to spread out into space.
p107
aVThe answers to these big questions
p108
aVshow that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
p109
aVBut if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years,
p110
aVour future is in space.
p111
aVThat is why I am in favor of manned \u2014
p112
aVor should I say,  personned \u2014 space flight.
p113
aa(lp114
VAll of my life I have sought to understand the universe
p115
aVand find answers to these questions.
p116
aVI have been very lucky
p117
aVthat my disability has not been a serious handicap.
p118
aVIndeed, it has probably given me more time than most people
p119
aVto pursue the quest for knowledge.
p120
aVThe ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe,
p121
aVand we are making good progress.
p122
aVThank you for listening.
p123
aa(lp124
VChris Anderson: Professor, if you had to guess either way,
p125
aVdo you now believe that it is more likely than not
p126
aVthat we are alone in the Milky Way,
p127
aVas a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?
p128
aVThis answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight
p129
aVinto the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.
p130
aa(lp131
VStephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization
p132
aVwithin several hundred light years;
p133
aVotherwise we would have heard radio waves.
p134
aVThe alternative is that civilizations don't last very long,
p135
aVbut destroy themselves.
p136
aa(lp137
VCA: Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.
p138
aVWe will take it as a salutary warning, I think,
p139
aVfor the rest of our conference this week.
p140
aVProfessor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made
p141
aVto share your questions with us today.
p142
aVThank you very much indeed.
