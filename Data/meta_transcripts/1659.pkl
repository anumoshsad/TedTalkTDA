VI have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother
p4
aVwho died in her exile:
p5
aV"Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.
p6
aVBut don't you ever turn
p7
aVinto a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."
p8
aa(lp9
VAlmost two years have passed
p10
aVsince the Libyan Revolution broke out,
p11
aVinspired by the waves of mass mobilization
p12
aVin both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.
p13
aVI joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya
p14
aVto call for a day of rage
p15
aVand to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
p16
aVAnd there it was, a great revolution.
p17
aVYoung Libyan women and men were at the forefront
p18
aVcalling for the fall of the regime,
p19
aVraising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
p20
aVThey have shown an exemplary bravery
p21
aVin confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
p22
aVThey have shown a great sense of solidarity
p23
aVfrom the far east to the far west to the south.
p24
aVEventually, after a period of six months of brutal war
p25
aVand a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,
p26
aVwe managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VHowever, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,
p31
aVa legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.
p32
aVFor four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime
p33
aVdestroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.
p34
aVAware of the devastation and the challenges,
p35
aVI was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,
p36
aVcalling for an inclusive and just transition
p37
aVto democracy and national reconciliation.
p38
aVAlmost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi
p39
aVduring and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi \u2014
p40
aValmost 300 in Tripoli.
p41
aa(lp42
VAfter a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,
p43
aVand with unique enthusiasm,
p44
aVI started organizing workshops
p45
aVon capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
p46
aVWith an amazing group of women,
p47
aVI co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,
p48
aVa movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,
p49
aVto lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women
p50
aVand to lobby for our right
p51
aVfor equal participation in building democracy and peace.
p52
aa(lp53
VI met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,
p54
aVan environment which was increasingly polarized,
p55
aVan environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
p56
aVI led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace
p57
aVto lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,
p58
aVa law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,
p59
aVthe right to vote and run,
p60
aVand most importantly to stipulate on political parties
p61
aVthe alternation of male and female candidates
p62
aVvertically and horizontally in their lists,
p63
aVcreating the zipper list.
p64
aVEventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.
p65
aVWomen won 17.5 percent of the National Congress
p66
aVin the first elections ever in 52 years.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Applause)
p69
aa(lp70
VHowever, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,
p71
aVand of the revolution as a whole,
p72
aVwas fading out \u2014
p73
aVfor every day we were waking up to the news of violence.
p74
aVOne day we wake up to the news
p75
aVof the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.
p76
aVOn another day we wake up to the news
p77
aVof the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.
p78
aVOn another day we wake up to the news
p79
aVof the assassination of army officers.
p80
aVAnd every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias
p81
aVand their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners
p82
aVand their disrespect of the rule of law.
p83
aa(lp84
VOur society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,
p85
aVbecame more polarized
p86
aVand has driven away from the ideals and the principles \u2014
p87
aVfreedom, dignity, social justice \u2014
p88
aVthat we first held.
p89
aVIntolerance, exclusion and revenge
p90
aVbecame the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.
p91
aVI am here today not at all to inspire you
p92
aVwith our success story of the zipper list and the elections.
p93
aVI'm rather here today to confess
p94
aVthat we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
p95
aVWe did not prioritize right.
p96
aVFor elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
p97
aVDid the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates
p98
aVbring peace and national reconciliation?
p99
aVNo, it didn't.
p100
aVWhat is it, then?
p101
aVWhy does our society continue to be polarized and dominated
p102
aVwith selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
p103
aa(lp104
VMaybe what was missing was not the women only,
p105
aVbut the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
p106
aVOur society needs national dialogue and consensus-building
p107
aVmore than it needed the elections,
p108
aVwhich only reinforced polarization and division.
p109
aVOur society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine
p110
aVmore than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
p111
aa(lp112
VWe need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.
p113
aVWe need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
p114
aVWe need to develop a feminine discourse
p115
aVthat not only honors but also implements
p116
aVmercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,
p117
aVinclusion instead of exclusion.
p118
aVThese are the ideals that a war-torn Libya
p119
aVneeds desperately in order to achieve peace.
p120
aa(lp121
VFor peace has an alchemy,
p122
aVand this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation
p123
aVbetween the feminine and masculine perspectives.
p124
aVThat's the real zipper.
p125
aVAnd we need to establish that existentially
p126
aVbefore we do so sociopolitically.
p127
aa(lp128
VAccording to a Quranic verse
p129
aV"Salam" \u2014 peace \u2014 "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."
p130
aVIn turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,
p131
aVhas the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" \u2014 womb \u2014
p132
aVsymbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity
p133
aVfrom which the male and the female,
p134
aVfrom which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
p135
aVAnd so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,
p136
aVthe divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
p137
aVThus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."
p138
aVThus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."
p139
aa(lp140
VMay we all be granted a grace of mercy.
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VThank you.
