VWhen I was five years old
p4
aVI fell in love with airplanes.
p5
aVNow I'm talking about the '30s.
p6
aVIn the '30s an airplane had two wings
p7
aVand a round motor,
p8
aVand was always flown
p9
aVby a guy who looked like Cary Grant.
p10
aVHe had high leather boots,
p11
aVjodhpurs, an old leather jacket,
p12
aVa wonderful helmet
p13
aVand those marvelous goggles \u2014
p14
aVand, inevitably, a white scarf,
p15
aVto flow in the wind.
p16
aVHe'd always walk up to his airplane
p17
aVin a kind of saunter,
p18
aVdevil-may-care saunter,
p19
aVflick the cigarette away,
p20
aVgrab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVAnd then mount his airplane,
p23
aVmaybe for the last time.
p24
aVOf course I always wondered what would happen
p25
aVif he'd kissed the airplane first.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VBut this was real romance to me.
p29
aVEverything about flying in those years,
p30
aVwhich was \u2014 you have to stop and think for a moment \u2014
p31
aVwas probably the most advanced
p32
aVtechnological thing going on at the time.
p33
aVSo as a youngster,
p34
aVI tried to get close to this
p35
aVby drawing airplanes,
p36
aVconstantly drawing airplanes.
p37
aVIt's the way I got
p38
aVa part of this romance.
p39
aVAnd of course, in a way, when I say romance,
p40
aVI mean in part
p41
aVthe aesthetics of that whole situation.
p42
aVI think the word is the holistic experience
p43
aVrevolving around a product.
p44
aVThe product was that airplane.
p45
aVBut it built a romance.
p46
aVEven the parts of the airplane
p47
aVhad French names.
p48
aVZe fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.
p49
aVYou know, from a romance language.
p50
aVSo that it was something that just got into your spirit.
p51
aVIt did mine.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd I decided I had to get closer than
p54
aVjust drawing fantasy airplanes.
p55
aVI wanted to build airplanes.
p56
aVSo I built model airplanes.
p57
aVAnd I found that in doing the model airplanes
p58
aVthe appearance drawings were not enough.
p59
aVYou couldn't transfer those
p60
aVto the model itself.
p61
aVIf you wanted it to fly
p62
aVyou had to learn the discipline
p63
aVof flying.
p64
aVYou had to learn about aeronautics.
p65
aVYou had to learn what made an airplane
p66
aVstay in the air.
p67
aVAnd of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.
p68
aVSo it had to be self-righting,
p69
aVand stay up without crashing.
p70
aVSo I had to give up
p71
aVthe approach of drawing
p72
aVthe fantasy shapes
p73
aVand convert it to technical drawings \u2014
p74
aVthe shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on \u2014
p75
aVand build an airplane over these drawings
p76
aVthat I knew followed some of the principles
p77
aVof flying.
p78
aVAnd in so doing, I could produce
p79
aVa model that would fly, stay in the air.
p80
aVAnd it had, once it was in the air,
p81
aVsome of this romance that I was in love with.
p82
aa(lp83
VWell the act of drawing airplanes
p84
aVled me to,
p85
aVwhen I had the opportunity to choose
p86
aVa course in school,
p87
aVled me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.
p88
aVAnd when I was sitting in classes \u2014
p89
aVin which no one asked me to draw an airplane \u2014
p90
aVto my surprise.
p91
aVI had to learn mathematics and mechanics
p92
aVand all this sort of thing.
p93
aVI'd wile away my time drawing airplanes
p94
aVin the class.
p95
aVOne day a young man looked over my shoulder,
p96
aVhe said, "You draw very well.
p97
aVYou should be in the art department."
p98
aVAnd I said, "Why?"
p99
aVAnd he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo my romance was temporarily shifted.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVAnd I went into art
p105
aVbecause they appreciated drawing.
p106
aVStudied painting; didn't do very well at that.
p107
aVWent through design,
p108
aVsome architecture.
p109
aVEventually hired myself out as a designer.
p110
aVAnd for the following 25 years,
p111
aVliving in Italy,
p112
aVliving in America,
p113
aVI doled out a piece of this romance
p114
aVto anybody who'd pay for it \u2014
p115
aVthis sense, this aesthetic feeling,
p116
aVfor the experience revolving around
p117
aVa designed object.
p118
aVAnd it exists.
p119
aVAny of you who rode the automobiles \u2014
p120
aVwas it yesterday? \u2014
p121
aVat the track, you know the romance
p122
aVrevolving around those high performance cars.
p123
aa(lp124
VWell in 25 years
p125
aVI was mostly putting out
p126
aVpieces of this romance
p127
aVand not getting a lot back in
p128
aVbecause design on call
p129
aVdoesn't always connect you with a circumstance
p130
aVin which you can produce things of this nature.
p131
aVSo after 25 years I began to feel
p132
aVas though I was running dry.
p133
aVAnd I quit.
p134
aVAnd I started up a very small operation \u2014
p135
aVwent from 40 people
p136
aVto one,
p137
aVin an effort to rediscover my innocence.
p138
aVI wanted to get back
p139
aVwhere the romance was.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I couldn't choose airplanes
p142
aVbecause they had gotten sort of unromantic
p143
aVat that point,
p144
aVeven though I'd done a lot of airplane work,
p145
aVon the interiors.
p146
aVSo I chose furniture.
p147
aVAnd I chose chairs specifically
p148
aVbecause I knew something about them.
p149
aVI'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years
p150
aVfor tractors and trucks
p151
aVand submarines \u2014
p152
aVall kinds of things.
p153
aVBut not office chairs.
p154
aVSo I started doing that.
p155
aVAnd I found that there were ways
p156
aVto duplicate the same approach
p157
aVthat I used to use on the airplane.
p158
aVOnly this time,
p159
aVinstead of the product being shaped by the wind,
p160
aVit was shaped by the human body.
p161
aVSo the discipline was \u2014
p162
aVas in the airplane you learn a lot about
p163
aVhow to deal with the air,
p164
aVfor a chair
p165
aVyou have to learn a lot about how to deal
p166
aVwith the body,
p167
aVand what the body needs, wants,
p168
aVindicates it needs.
p169
aVAnd that's the way, ultimately
p170
aVafter some ups and downs,
p171
aVI ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.
p172
aa(lp173
VI should say one more thing. When I was doing those
p174
aVmodel airplanes,
p175
aVI did everything.
p176
aVI conceived the kind of airplane.
p177
aVI basically engineered it.
p178
aVI built it.
p179
aVAnd I flew it.
p180
aVAnd that's the way I work now.
p181
aVWhen I started this chair
p182
aVit was not a preconceived notion.
p183
aVDesign nowadays, if you mean it,
p184
aVyou don't start with styling sketches.
p185
aVI started with a lot of loose ideas,
p186
aVroughly eight or nine years ago.
p187
aVAnd the loose ideas had something
p188
aVto do with what I knew happened with
p189
aVpeople in the office,
p190
aVat the work place \u2014 people who worked,
p191
aVand used task seating,
p192
aVa great many of them sitting in front of a computer
p193
aVall day long.
p194
aVAnd I felt,
p195
aVthe one thing they don't need,
p196
aVis a chair that interferes
p197
aVwith their main reason for sitting there.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo I took the approach
p200
aVthat the chair should do as much for them
p201
aVas humanly possible
p202
aVor as mechanistically possible
p203
aVso that they didn't have to fuss with it.
p204
aVSo my idea was that,
p205
aVinstead of sitting down and reaching
p206
aVfor a lot of controls,
p207
aVthat you would sit on the chair,
p208
aVand it would automatically balance your weight
p209
aVagainst the force required
p210
aVto recline.
p211
aVNow that may not mean a lot to some of you.
p212
aVBut you know most good chairs do recline
p213
aVbecause it's beneficial to open up this joint
p214
aVbetween your legs and your upper body
p215
aVfor better breathing
p216
aVand better flow.
p217
aVSo that if you sit down
p218
aVon my chair,
p219
aVwhether you're five feet tall
p220
aVor six foot six,
p221
aVit always deals with your weight
p222
aVand transfers the amount of force required
p223
aVto recline
p224
aVin a way that you don't have to look
p225
aVfor something to adjust.
p226
aa(lp227
VI'll tell you right up front,
p228
aVthis is a trade off.
p229
aVThere are drawbacks to this.
p230
aVOne is: you can't
p231
aVaccommodate everybody.
p232
aVThere are some very light people,
p233
aVsome extremely heavy people,
p234
aVmaybe people with a lot of bulk up top.
p235
aVThey begin to fall off the end of your chart.
p236
aVBut the compromise, I felt,
p237
aVwas in my favor
p238
aVbecause most people don't adjust their chairs.
p239
aVThey will sit in them forever.
p240
aVI had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack
p241
aVtell me about his sister calling him.
p242
aVHe said she had one of the new, better chairs.
p243
aVShe said, "Oh I love it."
p244
aVShe said, "But it's too high."
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aVSo he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."
p247
aVHe came over and looked at it.
p248
aVHe reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.
p249
aVShe said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"
p250
aVAnd he showed her the lever.
p251
aVWell, that's typical
p252
aVof a lot of us working in chairs.
p253
aVAnd why should you
p254
aVget a 20-page manual
p255
aVabout how to run a chair?
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVI had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnyway, I felt that it was important
p260
aVthat you didn't have to make an adjustment
p261
aVin order to get this kind of action.
p262
aVThe other thing I felt was that armrests
p263
aVhad never really been properly approached
p264
aVfrom the standpoint of how much
p265
aVof an aid they could be
p266
aVto your work life.
p267
aVBut I felt it was too much to ask
p268
aVto have to adjust each individual armrest
p269
aVin order to get it where you wanted.
p270
aVSo I spent a long time.
p271
aVI said I worked eight or nine years on it.
p272
aVAnd each of these things went along
p273
aVsort of in parallel
p274
aVbut incrementally were a problem of their own.
p275
aVI worked a long time on figuring out
p276
aVhow to move the arms over a much greater arc \u2014
p277
aVthat is up and down \u2014
p278
aVand make them a lot easier,
p279
aVso that you didn't have to use a button.
p280
aVAnd so after many trials, many failures,
p281
aVwe came up with a very simple arrangement
p282
aVin which we could just move
p283
aVone arm or the other.
p284
aVAnd they go up easily.
p285
aVAnd stop where you want.
p286
aVYou can put them down, essentially out of the way.
p287
aVNo arms at all.
p288
aVOr you can pull them up where you want them.
p289
aVAnd this was another thing that I felt,
p290
aVwhile not nearly as romantic
p291
aVas Cary Grant,
p292
aVnevertheless begins to
p293
aVgrab a little bit of aesthetic
p294
aVoperation, aesthetic performance
p295
aVinto a product.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe next area that was of interest to me
p298
aVwas the fact that reclining
p299
aVwas a very important factor.
p300
aVAnd the more you can recline,
p301
aVin a way, the better it is.
p302
aVThe more the angle between here and here opens up \u2014
p303
aVand nowadays, with a screen in front of you,
p304
aVyou don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,
p305
aVso we keep it at more or less the same level \u2014
p306
aVbut you transfer weight
p307
aVoff your tailbones.
p308
aVWould everybody put their hand under their bottom
p309
aVand feel their tailbone?
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVYou feel that bone under there?
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aVJust your own.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVThere's two of them, one on either side.
p316
aVAll the weight of your upper torso \u2014
p317
aVyour arms, your head \u2014
p318
aVgoes right down through your back,
p319
aVyour spine, into those bones when you sit.
p320
aVAnd that's a lot of load.
p321
aVJust relieving your arms with armrests
p322
aVtakes 20 percent of that load off.
p323
aVNow that, if your spine is not held in a good position,
p324
aVwill help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.
p325
aVSo to unload
p326
aVthat great weight \u2014
p327
aVif that indeed exists \u2014
p328
aVyou can recline.
p329
aVWhen you recline you take away a lot of that load
p330
aVoff your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.
p331
aVAt the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.
p332
aVAnd breathability is good.
p333
aa(lp334
VBut to do that, if you have any
p335
aVamount of recline,
p336
aVit gets to the point where you need a headrest
p337
aVbecause nearly always,
p338
aVautomatically hold your head
p339
aVin a vertical position, see?
p340
aVAs I recline, my head says more or less vertical.
p341
aVWell if you're reclined a great deal,
p342
aVyou have to use muscle force
p343
aVto hold your head there.
p344
aVSo that's where a headrest comes in.
p345
aVNow headrest is a challenge
p346
aVbecause you want it to adjust
p347
aVenough so that it'll fit,
p348
aVyou know, a tall guy and a short girl.
p349
aVSo here we are.
p350
aVI've got five inches of adjustment here
p351
aVin order to get the headrest in the right place.
p352
aVBut then I knew from experience
p353
aVand looking around in offices
p354
aVwhere there were chairs with headrests
p355
aVthat nobody would ever bother
p356
aVto reach back and turn a knob
p357
aVand adjust the headrest to put it in position.
p358
aVAnd you need it in a different position
p359
aVwhen you're upright, then when you're reclined.
p360
aVSo I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.
p361
aVSo if you watch this chair
p362
aVas I recline, the headrest comes up
p363
aVto meet my neck.
p364
aVIdeally you want to put the head support
p365
aVin the cranial area, right there.
p366
aVSo that part of it took a long time
p367
aVto work out.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,
p370
aVthe gel we put.
p371
aVWe stole the idea from bicycle seats,
p372
aVand put gel in the cushions
p373
aVand in the armrests
p374
aVto absorb point load \u2014
p375
aVdistributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.
p376
aVYou cant hit your elbow
p377
aVon bottom.
p378
aVAnd I did want to demonstrate
p379
aVthe fact that the chair can accommodate people.
p380
aVWhile you're sitting in it you can adjust it
p381
aVdown for the five-footer,
p382
aVor you can adjust it
p383
aVfor the six-foot-six guy \u2014
p384
aVall within the scope of a few simple adjustments.
