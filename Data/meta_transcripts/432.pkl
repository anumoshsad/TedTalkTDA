(lp3
VOf the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most,
p4
aVand it's the one that I can least take for granted.
p5
aVI think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.
p6
aVIt was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.
p7
aVOne time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VYeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,
p12
aVwhich may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty
p13
aVor Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
p14
aVThey handed out these dark plastic viewers
p15
aVthat allowed us to look directly at the sun
p16
aVwithout damaging our eyes.
p17
aVBut Dad got really scared; he didn't want us doing that.
p18
aVHe wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers,
p19
aVso that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.
p20
aVI thought this was a little strange at the time.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhat I didn't know at the time
p23
aVwas that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.
p24
aVWhen he and his sister Martha were just very little,
p25
aVtheir mom took them out to see a total eclipse \u2014
p26
aVor actually, a solar eclipse \u2014
p27
aVand not long after that, both of them started losing their eyesight.
p28
aVDecades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness
p29
aVwas most likely some sort of bacterial infection.
p30
aVAs near as we can tell, it had nothing whatsoever to do
p31
aVwith that solar eclipse,
p32
aVbut by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave
p33
aVthinking it was her fault.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,
p36
aVmarried my mom,
p37
aVand bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts,
p38
aVwhere the first shots were fired against the British in 1775,
p39
aValthough we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.
p40
aVHe got a job working for Raytheon designing guidance systems,
p41
aVwhich was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days \u2014
p42
aVso, the equivalent of Silicon Valley in the '70s.
p43
aVDad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy;
p44
aVhe just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II
p45
aVon account of his handicap,
p46
aValthough they did let him get through
p47
aVthe several-hour-long army physical exam
p48
aVbefore they got to the very last test, which was for vision.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo Dad started racking up all of these patents
p53
aVand gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.
p54
aVBut to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal.
p55
aVAs a kid, I watched a lot of television
p56
aVand had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology
p57
aVand the space program and a little bit of politics.
p58
aVI played a lot of chess.
p59
aVBut at the age of 14, a friend got me interested in comic books,
p60
aVand I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, here's my dad:
p63
aVhe's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.
p64
aVSo, he has four kids, right?
p65
aVOne grows up to become a computer scientist,
p66
aVone grows up to join the Navy,
p67
aVone grows up to become an engineer ...
p68
aVAnd then there's me: the comic book artist.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VWhich, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen,
p73
aVbecause I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor,
p74
aVand he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VRight? It's true.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VThe funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.
p83
aVHe had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist,
p84
aVeven though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever;
p85
aVeverything he saw was just a blur.
p86
aVNow, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith,"
p87
aVwhich doesn't have the same negative connotation for me
p88
aVthat it does for other people.
p89
aVNow, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved,
p90
aVis not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.
p91
aVI tend to like science,
p92
aVwhere what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut there's a middle ground, too \u2014
p95
aVa middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage
p96
aVand his steam-driven computers that were never built.
p97
aVNobody really understood what it was that he had in mind
p98
aVexcept for Ada Lovelace,
p99
aVand he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.
p100
aVVannevar Bush with his memex \u2014
p101
aVthis idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips \u2014
p102
aVhe had this vision.
p103
aVAnd I think a lot of people in his day
p104
aVprobably thought he was a bit of a kook.
p105
aVAnd, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say,
p106
aV"Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VBut that's not the point; he understood the shape of the future.
p111
aVSo did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.
p112
aVSame thing: he understood the shape of the future,
p113
aVeven though it was something that would only be implemented
p114
aVby people much later.
p115
aVOr Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
p116
aVHardly anybody listened to him in his day.
p117
aVOr even the people who actually pulled it off,
p118
aVthe people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston,
p119
aVwho just would sketch out these structures
p120
aVof what would eventually become a worldwide network,
p121
aVand sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers
p122
aVand arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's \u2014
p123
aVon Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,
p124
aVjust two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred
p125
aVand listening to Gladys Knight & The Pips
p126
aVsinging "Midnight Train to Georgia" \u2014
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
Vin my dad's big easy chair, you know?
p131
aa(lp132
VSo, three types of vision, right?
p133
aVVision based on what one cannot see,
p134
aVthe vision of that unseen and unknowable.
p135
aVThe vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.
p136
aVAnd this third kind, a vision of something which can be, which may be,
p137
aVbased on knowledge but is, as yet, unproven.
p138
aVNow, we've seen a lot of examples of people
p139
aVwho are pursuing that sort of vision in science,
p140
aVbut I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics,
p141
aVit's even true in personal endeavors.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat it comes down to, really, is four basic principles:
p144
aVlearn from everyone;
p145
aVfollow no one;
p146
aVwatch for patterns;
p147
aVand work like hell.
p148
aVI think these are the four principles that go into this.
p149
aVAnd it's that third one, especially,
p150
aVwhere visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
p151
aVWhat's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world,
p152
aVis, I think, only one of four different ways
p153
aVthat manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.
p154
aVIn comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude
p155
aVtowards trying to understand how it works.
p156
aVThen there's another, more classical attitude
p157
aVwhich embraces beauty and craft;
p158
aVanother one which believes in the pure transparency of content;
p159
aVand then another, which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience
p160
aVand honesty and rawness.
p161
aa(lp162
VThese are four very different ways of looking at the world.
p163
aVI even gave them names:
p164
aVthe classicist, the animist, the formalist and iconoclast.
p165
aVInterestingly, they seem to correspond more or less
p166
aVto Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.
p167
aVAnd they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight
p168
aVon left and the right;
p169
aVtradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
p170
aVAnd if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form,
p171
aVand then beauty and truth.
p172
aVAnd it probably applies just as much to music and movies and fine art,
p173
aVwhich has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all,
p174
aVor, for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme
p175
aVof "Inspired by Nature,"
p176
aVexcept to the extent of the fable of the frog
p177
aVwho gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river
p178
aVbecause the scorpion promises not to sting him,
p179
aVbut the scorpion stings him anyway and they both die,
p180
aVbut not before the frog asks him why, and the scorpion says,
p181
aV"Because it's my nature."
p182
aVIn that sense, yes.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VSo this was my nature.
p187
aVThe thing was, I saw that the route I took
p188
aVto discovering this focus in my work
p189
aVand who I was \u2014
p190
aVI saw it as just this road to discovery.
p191
aVActually, it was just me embracing my nature,
p192
aVwhich means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree, after all.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?
p195
aVI started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them,
p196
aValmost immediately.
p197
aVOne of the most important things about comics that I discovered
p198
aVwas that comics are a visual medium,
p199
aVbut they try to embrace all of the senses within it.
p200
aVSo, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words,
p201
aVand the different symbols and everything in between
p202
aVthat comics presents,
p203
aVare all funneled through the single conduit, a vision.
p204
aVSo we have things like resemblance,
p205
aVwhere something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted
p206
aVin a couple of different directions:
p207
aVabstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning,
p208
aVor abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning
p209
aVtowards the picture plane.
p210
aa(lp211
VPut all these three together, and you have a nice little map
p212
aVof the entire boundary of visual iconography,
p213
aVwhich comics can embrace.
p214
aVAnd if you move to the right you also get language,
p215
aVbecause that's abstracting even further from resemblance,
p216
aVbut still maintaining meaning.
p217
aVVision is called upon to represent sound
p218
aVand to understand the common properties of those two
p219
aVand their common heritage as well;
p220
aValso, to try to represent the texture of sound
p221
aVto capture its essential character through visuals.
p222
aVThere's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.
p223
aVComics is a kind of call and response,
p224
aVin which the artist gives you something to see within the panels,
p225
aVand then gives you something to imagine between the panels.
p226
aa(lp227
VAlso, another sense which comics' vision represents,
p228
aVand that's time.
p229
aVSequence is a very important aspect of comics.
p230
aVComics presents a kind of temporal map.
p231
aVAnd this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics,
p232
aVbut I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes
p233
aVother sorts of forms,
p234
aVand I found some in history.
p235
aVYou can see this same principle operating
p236
aVin these ancient versions of the same idea.
p237
aVWhat's happening is,
p238
aVan art form is colliding with a given technology,
p239
aVwhether it's paint on stone,
p240
aVlike the Tomb of Menna the Scribe in ancient Egypt,
p241
aVor a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column,
p242
aVor a 200-foot-long embroidery,
p243
aVor painted deerskin and tree bark
p244
aVrunning across 88 accordion-folded pages.
p245
aa(lp246
VWhat's interesting is, once you hit "print" \u2014
p247
aVand this is from 1450, by the way \u2014
p248
aVall of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves:
p249
aVrectilinear panel arrangements,
p250
aVsimple line drawings without tone,
p251
aVand a left-to-right reading sequence.
p252
aVAnd within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions,
p253
aVand it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.
p254
aVSo I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book,
p255
aVI had to do a little bit of typesetting,
p256
aVand I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it,
p257
aVso I bought a computer.
p258
aVAnd it was just a little thing \u2014
p259
aVit wasn't good for much except text entry \u2014
p260
aVbut my father had told me about Moore's law back in the '70s,
p261
aVand I knew what was coming.
p262
aVAnd so, I kept my eyes peeled
p263
aVto see if the sort of changes that happened
p264
aVwhen we went from pre-print comics to print comics
p265
aVwould happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, one of the first things proposed
p268
aVwas that we could mix the visuals of comics
p269
aVwith the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs
p270
aVbeing made in those days.
p271
aVThis was even before the Web.
p272
aVAnd one of the first things they did was,
p273
aVthey tried to take the comics page as is
p274
aVand transplant it to monitors,
p275
aVwhich was a classic McLuhanesque mistake
p276
aVof appropriating the shape of the previous technology
p277
aVas the content of the new technology.
p278
aVAnd so, what they would do is have these comic pages
p279
aVthat resemble print comics pages,
p280
aVand they would introduce all this sound and motion.
p281
aVThe problem was that if you go with this basic idea
p282
aVthat space equals time in comics,
p283
aVwhat happens is that when you introduce sound and motion,
p284
aVwhich are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time,
p285
aVthey break with that continuity of presentation.
p286
aa(lp287
VInteractivity was another thing.
p288
aVThere were hypertext comics, but the thing about hypertext
p289
aVis that everything in hypertext is either here, not here,
p290
aVor connected to here;
p291
aVit's profoundly nonspatial.
p292
aVThe distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny
p293
aVto Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives:
p294
aVit's all the same.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VBut in comics,
p299
aVevery aspect of the work, every element of the work,
p300
aVhas a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo the question was:
p303
aVWas there any way to preserve that spatial relationship
p304
aVwhile still taking advantage of all of the things
p305
aVthat digital had to offer us?
p306
aVAnd I found my personal answer for this
p307
aVin those ancient comics that I was showing you.
p308
aVEach of them has a single unbroken reading line,
p309
aVwhether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column
p310
aVor just straight left to right,
p311
aVor even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages,
p312
aVthe same thing is happening;
p313
aVthat is, that the basic idea that as you move through space
p314
aVyou move through time,
p315
aVis being carried out without any compromise,
p316
aVbut there were compromises when print hit.
p317
aVAdjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments,
p318
aVso the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again
p319
aVand again and again.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd I thought, OK, well, if that's true,
p322
aVis there any way, when we go beyond today's print,
p323
aVto somehow bring that back?
p324
aVNow, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?
p325
aVIt's a different shape, but other than that,
p326
aVit's the same basic limitation.
p327
aVBut that's only if you look at the monitor as a page,
p328
aVbut not if you look at the monitor as a window.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd that's what I propose,
p331
aVthat perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas,
p332
aValong the X axis and the Y axis
p333
aVand staircases.
p334
aVWe could do circular narratives that were literally circular.
p335
aVWe could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.
p336
aVParallel narratives could be literally parallel.
p337
aVX, Y and also Z.
p338
aVSo I had all these notions.
p339
aVThis was back in the late '90s,
p340
aVand other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy,
p341
aVbut a lot of people then went on and actually did it.
p342
aVI'm going to show you a couple now.
p343
aa(lp344
VThis was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jasen Lex.
p345
aVAnd notice what's going on here.
p346
aVWhat I'm searching for is a durable mutation \u2014
p347
aVthat's what all of us are searching for.
p348
aVAs media head into this new era,
p349
aVwe are looking for mutations that are durable,
p350
aVthat have some sort of staying power.
p351
aVNow, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium,
p352
aVand we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.
p353
aVThat's that entire comic you just saw, up on the screen right now.
p354
aVBut even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time,
p355
aVthat's just where the technology is right now.
p356
aVAs the technology evolves,
p357
aVas you get full immersive displays and whatnot,
p358
aVthis sort of thing will only grow; it will adapt.
p359
aVIt will adapt to its environment; it's a durable mutation.
p360
aa(lp361
VHere's another one.
p362
aVThis is by Drew Weing; this is called
p363
aV"'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death of the Universe."
p364
aVSee what's going on here
p365
aVas we draw these stories on an infinite canvas
p366
aVis you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
p367
aVWe'll go by this a little quickly. You get the idea.
p368
aVI just want to get to the last panel.
p369
aa(lp370
V[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup! Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
V[Pup: Did either of you realize
p375
aVthat eventually the universe will be nothing but a thin, cold gas
p376
aVspread across infinite, lonely space?]
p377
aa(lp378
V[Cat 1: Oh ... Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VJust one more.
p383
aVTalk about your infinite canvas.
p384
aVIt's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.
p385
aa(lp386
VWhy is this important?
p387
aVI think this is important because media \u2014
p388
aVall media \u2014
p389
aVprovide us a window back into our world.
p390
aVNow, it could be that motion pictures and eventually, virtual reality,
p391
aVor something equivalent to it, some sort of immersive display,
p392
aVis going to provide us with our most efficient escape
p393
aVfrom the world that we're in.
p394
aVThat's why most people turn to storytelling, to escape.
p395
aVBut media provides us with a window back into the world we live in.
p396
aVAnd when media evolve
p397
aVso that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique \u2014
p398
aVbecause what you're looking at is comics cubed,
p399
aVyou're looking at comics that are more comics-like
p400
aVthan they've ever been before \u2014
p401
aVwhen that happens, you provide people with multiple ways
p402
aVof reentering the world through different windows.
p403
aVAnd when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world they live in
p404
aVand see its shape.
p405
aVThat's why I think this is important.
p406
aVOne of many reasons, but I've got to go now.
p407
aVThank you for having me.
