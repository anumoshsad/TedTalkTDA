VWhen the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about 500 years ago,
p4
aVthey obviously found this amazing tropical forest.
p5
aVAnd among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before,
p6
aVthey found one species that caught their attention very quickly.
p7
aVThis species, when you cut the bark, you find a very dark red resin
p8
aVthat was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes.
p9
aVThe indigenous people called this species pau brasil,
p10
aVand that's the reason why this land became "land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.
p11
aVThat's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree.
p12
aVSo you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil,
p13
aVamong other reasons.
p14
aa(lp15
VForest products are all around us.
p16
aVApart from all those products,
p17
aVthe forest is very important for climate regulation.
p18
aVIn Brazil, almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain
p19
aVactually comes from the forest.
p20
aVJust the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere 20 billion tons of water every day.
p21
aVThis is more than what the Amazon River, which is the largest river in the world,
p22
aVputs in the sea per day, which is 17 billion tons.
p23
aVIf we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration,
p24
aVwe would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world.
p25
aVSo it's a hell of a service for all of us.
p26
aa(lp27
VWe have in the world about four billion hectares of forests.
p28
aVThis is more or less China, U.S., Canada and Brazil all together,
p29
aVin terms of size, to have an idea.
p30
aVThree quarters of that is in the temperate zone,
p31
aVand just one quarter is in the tropics,
p32
aVbut this one quarter, one billion hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,
p33
aVand very importantly, 50 percent of the living biomass, the carbon.
p34
aVNow, we used to have six billion hectares of forest \u2014
p35
aV50 percent more than what we have \u2014 2,000 years ago.
p36
aVWe've actually lost two billion hectares in the last 2,000 years.
p37
aVBut in the last 100 years, we lost half of that.
p38
aVThat was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests
p39
aVto deforestation of tropical forests.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo think of this: In 100 years,
p42
aVwe lost the same amount of forest in the tropics
p43
aVthat we lost in 2,000 years in temperate forests.
p44
aVThat's the speed of the destruction that we are having.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle.
p47
aVWe have the second largest forest in the world, just after Russia.
p48
aVIt means 12 percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil,
p49
aVmost of that in the Amazon.
p50
aVIt's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big, large area.
p51
aVYou can see that you could fit many of the European countries there.
p52
aVWe still have 80 percent of the forest cover.
p53
aVThat's the good news.
p54
aVBut we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.
p55
aVSo if you go with that speed,
p56
aVvery soon, we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon
p57
aVthat regulates our climate.
p58
aa(lp59
VDeforestation was growing fast and accelerating
p60
aVat the end of the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s.
p61
aV(Chainsaw sound)
p62
aV(Sound of falling tree)
p63
aVTwenty-seven thousand square kilometers in one year.
p64
aVThis is 2.7 million hectares.
p65
aVIt's almost like half of Costa Rica every year.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo at this moment \u2014 this is 2003, 2004 \u2014
p68
aVI happened to be coming to work in the government.
p69
aVAnd together with other teammates in the National Forest Department,
p70
aVwe were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation,
p71
aVand make a plan to combat that at a national level,
p72
aVinvolving the local governments, the civil society,
p73
aVbusiness, local communities,
p74
aVin an effort that could tackle those causes.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo we came up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas.
p77
aVNow I will go through all of them one by one \u2014
p78
aVno, just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years.
p79
aVSo the first thing, we set up a system with the national space agency
p80
aVthat could actually see where deforestation is happening,
p81
aValmost in real time.
p82
aVSo now in Brazil,  we have this system, DETER,
p83
aVwhere every month, or every two months,
p84
aVwe get information on where deforestation is happening
p85
aVso we can actually act when it's happening.
p86
aVAnd all the information is fully transparent
p87
aVso others can replicate that in independent systems.
p88
aVThis allows us, among other things,
p89
aVto apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken.
p90
aVPart of that we saw and sell, and all the revenue becomes a fund
p91
aVthat now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund.
p92
aVThis also allows us to make a big operation
p93
aVto seize corruption and illegal activities
p94
aVthat ended up having 700 people in prison, including a lot of public servants.
p95
aVThen we made the connection that areas that have been doing
p96
aVillegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance.
p97
aVSo we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users.
p98
aVSo supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, and so on
p99
aVthat buy products from illegal clear-cut areas,
p100
aVthey also can be liable for the deforestation.
p101
aVSo making all these connections to help to push the problem down.
p102
aVAnd also we work a lot on land tenure issues.
p103
aVIt's very important for conflicts.
p104
aVFifty million hectares of protected areas were created,
p105
aVwhich is an area the size of Spain.
p106
aVAnd of those, eight million were indigenous lands.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow we start to see results.
p109
aVSo in the last 10 years,
p110
aVdeforestation came down in Brazil 75 percent.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo if we compare it with the average deforestation
p115
aVthat we had in the last decade,
p116
aVwe saved 8.7 million hectares, which is the size of Austria.
p117
aVBut more importantly, it avoided the emission
p118
aVof three billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.
p119
aVThis is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
p120
aVuntil today, as a positive action.
p121
aVOne may think that when you do these kinds of actions
p122
aVto decrease, to push down deforestation,
p123
aVyou will have an economic impact
p124
aVbecause you will not have economic activity or something like that.
p125
aVBut it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite.
p126
aVIn fact, in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation,
p127
aVthe economy grew, on average, double from the previous decade,
p128
aVwhen deforestation was actually going up.
p129
aVSo it's a good lesson for us.
p130
aVMaybe this is completely disconnected,
p131
aVas we just learned by having deforestation come down.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow this is all good news, and it's quite an achievement,
p134
aVand we obviously should be very proud about that.
p135
aVBut it's not even close to sufficient.
p136
aVIn fact, if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,
p137
aVthat was over half a million hectares,
p138
aVwhich means that every minute,
p139
aVan area the size of two soccer fields
p140
aVis being cut in the Amazon last year, just last year.
p141
aVIf we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil,
p142
aVwe are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world.
p143
aVIt's more or less like we are forest heroes,
p144
aVbut still deforestation champions.
p145
aVSo we can't be satisfied, not even close to satisfied.
p146
aVSo the next step, I think,
p147
aVis to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil
p148
aVand to have that as a goal for 2020.
p149
aVThat's our next step.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow I've always been interested in the relationship
p152
aVbetween climate change and forests.
p153
aVFirst, because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation,
p154
aVso it's a big part of the problem.
p155
aVBut also, forests can be a big part of the solution
p156
aVsince that's the best way we know to sink, capture and store carbon.
p157
aVNow, there is another relationship of climate and forests
p158
aVthat really stuck me in 2008 and made me change my career
p159
aVfrom forests to working with climate change.
p160
aVI went to visit Canada, in British Columbia,
p161
aVtogether with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries
p162
aVthat we have a kind of alliance of them, like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.
p163
aVAnd when we were there we learned about this pine beetle
p164
aVthat is literally eating the forests in Canada.
p165
aVWhat we see here, those brown trees, these are really dead trees.
p166
aVThey are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle.
p167
aVWhat happens is that this beetle
p168
aVis controlled by the cold weather in the winter.
p169
aVFor many years now, they don't have the sufficient cold weather
p170
aVto actually control the population of this beetle.
p171
aVAnd it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees.
p172
aVSo I came back with this notion that the forest is actually
p173
aVone of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo I was thinking,
p176
aVif I succeed in working with all my colleagues
p177
aVto actually help to stop deforestation,
p178
aVmaybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change
p179
aVby floods, heat, fires and so on.
p180
aVSo I decided to leave the forest service
p181
aVand start to work directly on climate change,
p182
aVfind a way to think and understand the challenge, and go from there.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward.
p185
aVThe goal is very clear.
p186
aVWe want to limit the increase of the average temperature
p187
aVof the planet to two degrees.
p188
aVThere are several reasons for that.
p189
aVI will not get into that now.
p190
aVBut in order to get to this limit of two degrees,
p191
aVwhich is possible for us to survive,
p192
aVthe IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
p193
aVdefines that we have a budget of emissions of 1,000 billion tons of CO2
p194
aVfrom now until the end of the century.
p195
aVSo if we divide this by the number of years,
p196
aVwhat we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.
p197
aVNow what is one ton of CO2?
p198
aVIt's more or less what one small car, running 20 kilometers a day,
p199
aVwill emit in one year.
p200
aVOr it's one flight, one way,
p201
aVfrom São Paulo to Johannesburg or to London, one way.
p202
aVTwo ways, two tons.
p203
aVSo 11 billion tons is twice that.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow the emissions today are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.
p206
aVIt's growing and maybe it will be 61 by 2020.
p207
aVNow we need to go down to 10 by 2050.
p208
aVAnd while this happens,
p209
aVthe population will grow from seven to nine billion people,
p210
aVthe economy will grow from 60 trillion dollars in 2010
p211
aVto 200 trillion dollars.
p212
aVAnd so what we need to do is to be much more efficient
p213
aVin a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita
p214
aVper person, per year, into something like one.
p215
aVYou have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo the question is, can we make it?
p218
aVAnd that's the exactly the same question
p219
aVI got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation.
p220
aVIt's such a big problem, so complex. Can we really do it?
p221
aVI think so. Think of this:
p222
aVDeforestation means 60 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions
p223
aVin Brazil in the last decade.
p224
aVNow it's a little bit less than 30 percent.
p225
aVIn the world, 60 percent is energy.
p226
aVSo if we can tackle directly the energy,
p227
aVthe same way we could tackle deforestation,
p228
aVmaybe we can have a chance.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo there are five things that I think we should do.
p231
aVFirst, we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions.
p232
aVWe don't need to clear-cut all the forests to actually get more jobs
p233
aVand agriculture and have more economy.
p234
aVThat's what we proved when we decreased deforestation
p235
aVand the economy continued to grow.
p236
aVSame thing could happen in the energy sector.
p237
aVSecond, we have to move the incentives to the right place.
p238
aVToday, 500 billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.
p239
aVWhy don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy?
p240
aVThird, we need to measure and make it transparent
p241
aVwhere, when and who is emitting greenhouse gases
p242
aVso we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities.
p243
aVFourth, we need to leapfrog the routes of development,
p244
aVwhich means, you don't need to go to the landline telephone
p245
aVbefore you get to the mobile phones.
p246
aVSame way we don't need to go to fossil fuels
p247
aVto the one billion people who don't have access to energy
p248
aVbefore we get to the clean energy.
p249
aVAnd fifth and last,
p250
aVwe need to share responsibility between governments,
p251
aVbusiness and civil society.
p252
aVThere is work to do for everybody, and we need to have everybody on board.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo to finalize,
p255
aVI think the future is not like a fate
p256
aVthat you have to just go as business as usual goes.
p257
aVWe need to have the courage to actually change the route,
p258
aVinvest in something new,
p259
aVthink that we can actually change the route.
p260
aVI think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil,
p261
aVand I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you.
