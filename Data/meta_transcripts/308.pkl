VAs a clergyman,
p4
aVyou can imagine how
p5
aVout of place I feel.
p6
aVI feel like a fish out of water,
p7
aVor maybe an owl out of the air.

aa(lp11
VI was preaching in San Jose some time ago,
p12
aVand my friend Mark Kvamme,
p13
aVwho helped introduce me
p14
aVto this conference,
p15
aVbrought several CEOs
p16
aVand leaders
p17
aVof some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley
p18
aVto have breakfast with me, or I with them.
p19
aVAnd I was so stimulated.
p20
aVAnd had such \u2014 it was an
p21
aVeye-opening experience
p22
aVto hear them talk about
p23
aVthe world that is yet to come
p24
aVthrough technology
p25
aVand science.
p26
aVI know that we're near the end of this conference,
p27
aVand some of you may be wondering
p28
aVwhy they have a speaker
p29
aVfrom the field of religion.
p30
aVRichard can answer that,
p31
aVbecause he made that decision.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,
p34
aVcoming down.
p35
aVI was to address a conference
p36
aVat a hotel.
p37
aVAnd on that elevator a man said,
p38
aV"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."
p39
aVAnd another man looked in my direction and said,
p40
aV"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."
p41
aVAnd this man looked me up and down
p42
aVfor about 10 seconds,
p43
aVand he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VI hope
p48
aVthat you won't feel that these few moments with me
p49
aVis not a \u2014 is an anticlimax,
p50
aVafter all these tremendous
p51
aVtalks that you've heard,
p52
aVand addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.
p53
aVBut I was
p54
aVon an airplane in the east some years ago,
p55
aVand the man sitting across the aisle from me
p56
aVwas the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.
p57
aVHis name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
p58
aVAnd there was a drunk man on there,
p59
aVand he got up out of his seat two or three times,
p60
aVand he was making everybody upset
p61
aVby what he was trying to do.
p62
aVAnd he was slapping the stewardess
p63
aVand pinching her as she went by,
p64
aVand everybody was upset with him.
p65
aVAnd finally, John Belk said,
p66
aV"Do you know who's sitting here?"
p67
aVAnd the man said, "No, who?"
p68
aVHe said, "It's Billy Graham,
p69
aVthe preacher."
p70
aVHe said, "You don't say!"
p71
aVAnd he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"
p72
aVHe said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd I suppose that that's true
p77
aVwith thousands of people.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VI know that as you have been peering into the future,
p82
aVand as we've heard some of it here tonight,
p83
aVI would like to live in that age
p84
aVand see what is going to be.
p85
aVBut I won't,
p86
aVbecause I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,
p87
aVand I know that my time is brief.
p88
aVI have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,
p89
aVand that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,
p90
aVbecause I have Parkinson's disease
p91
aVin addition to that,
p92
aVand some other problems that I won't talk about.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VBut this is not the first time
p97
aVthat we've had a technological revolution.
p98
aVWe've had others.
p99
aVAnd there's one that I want to talk about.
p100
aVIn one generation,
p101
aVthe nation of the people of Israel
p102
aVhad a tremendous and dramatic change
p103
aVthat made them a great power in the Near East.
p104
aVA man by the name of David
p105
aVcame to the throne,
p106
aVand King David became one of the great leaders
p107
aVof his generation.
p108
aVHe was a man of tremendous leadership.
p109
aVHe had the favor of God with him.
p110
aVHe was a brilliant poet,
p111
aVphilosopher, writer, soldier \u2014
p112
aVwith strategies in battle and conflict
p113
aVthat people study even today.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut about two centuries before David,
p116
aVthe Hittites
p117
aVhad discovered the secret
p118
aVof smelting and processing of iron,
p119
aVand, slowly, that skill spread.
p120
aVBut they wouldn't allow the Israelis
p121
aVto look into it, or to have any.
p122
aVBut David changed all of that,
p123
aVand he introduced the Iron Age
p124
aVto Israel.
p125
aVAnd the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,
p126
aVand which archaeologists have found,
p127
aVthat in present-day Palestine,
p128
aVthere are evidences of that generation.
p129
aVNow, instead of crude tools
p130
aVmade of sticks and stones,
p131
aVIsrael now had iron plows,
p132
aVand sickles, and hoes
p133
aVand military weapons.
p134
aVAnd in the course of one generation,
p135
aVIsrael was completely changed.
p136
aVThe introduction of iron, in some ways,
p137
aVhad an impact
p138
aVa little bit like the microchip
p139
aVhas had on our generation.
p140
aVAnd
p141
aVDavid found
p142
aVthat there were many problems that technology could not solve.
p143
aa(lp144
VThere were many problems still left.
p145
aVAnd they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,
p146
aVand I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.
p147
aVHow do we solve these three problems
p148
aVthat I'd like to mention?
p149
aVThe first one that David saw
p150
aVwas human evil.
p151
aVWhere does it come from?
p152
aVHow do we solve it?
p153
aVOver again and again
p154
aVin the Psalms,
p155
aVwhich Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,
p156
aVDavid describes the evils of the human race.
p157
aVAnd yet he says,
p158
aV"He restores my soul."
p159
aVHave you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
p160
aVOn one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe
p161
aVand dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,
p162
aVas this conference vividly demonstrates.
p163
aVWe've seen under the sea,
p164
aVthree miles down,
p165
aVor galaxies hundreds of billions of years
p166
aVout in the future.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut on the other hand,
p169
aVsomething is wrong.
p170
aVOur battleships,
p171
aVour soldiers,
p172
aVare on a frontier now,
p173
aValmost ready to go to war
p174
aVwith Iraq.
p175
aVNow, what causes this?
p176
aVWhy do we have these wars in every generation,
p177
aVand in every part of the world?
p178
aVAnd revolutions?
p179
aVWe can't get along with other people,
p180
aVeven in our own families.
p181
aVWe find ourselves in the paralyzing grip
p182
aVof self-destructive habits we can't break.
p183
aVRacism and injustice and violence sweep our world,
p184
aVbringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.
p185
aVEven the most sophisticated among us
p186
aVseem powerless to break this cycle.
p187
aVI would like to see Oracle
p188
aVtake up that,
p189
aVor
p190
aVsome other
p191
aVtechnological geniuses work on this.
p192
aVHow do we change man,
p193
aVso that he doesn't lie and cheat,
p194
aVand our newspapers are not filled with stories
p195
aVof fraud in business or labor
p196
aVor athletics or wherever?
p197
aa(lp198
VThe Bible says the problem is within us,
p199
aVwithin our hearts and our souls.
p200
aVOur problem is that we are separated
p201
aVfrom our Creator,
p202
aVwhich we call God,
p203
aVand we need to have our souls restored,
p204
aVsomething only God can do.
p205
aVJesus said, "For out of the heart
p206
aVcome evil thoughts:
p207
aVmurders, sexual immorality,
p208
aVtheft, false testimonies,
p209
aVslander."
p210
aVThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell
p211
aVwas not a religious man,
p212
aVbut he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,
p213
aVand it's from our hearts
p214
aVthat it must be plucked out."
p215
aVAlbert Einstein \u2014
p216
aVI was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,
p217
aVand I met
p218
aVMr. Einstein.
p219
aVHe didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said
p220
aVnobody was qualified to give him one.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VBut he made this statement.
p225
aVHe said, "It's easier to denature plutonium
p226
aVthan to denature the evil spirit of man."
p227
aVAnd many of you, I'm sure,
p228
aVhave thought about that
p229
aVand puzzled over it.
p230
aVYou've seen people
p231
aVtake beneficial technological advances,
p232
aVsuch as the Internet we've heard about tonight,
p233
aVand twist them into something corrupting.
p234
aVYou've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses
p235
aVthat bring down whole systems.
p236
aVThe Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,
p237
aVhorribly used.
p238
aVThe problem is not technology.
p239
aVThe problem is the person or persons using it.
p240
aVKing David said
p241
aVthat he knew the depths of his own soul.
p242
aVHe couldn't free himself from personal problems
p243
aVand personal evils
p244
aVthat included murder and adultery.
p245
aVYet King David sought God's forgiveness,
p246
aVand said, "You can restore my soul."
p247
aa(lp248
VYou see, the Bible teaches
p249
aVthat we're more than a body and a mind.
p250
aVWe are a soul.
p251
aVAnd there's something inside of us
p252
aVthat is beyond our understanding.
p253
aVThat's the part of us that yearns
p254
aVfor God, or something more
p255
aVthan we find in technology.
p256
aVYour soul is that part of you that
p257
aVyearns for meaning in life,
p258
aVand which seeks for something beyond this life.
p259
aVIt's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.
p260
aVI find [that] young people all over the world
p261
aVare searching for something.
p262
aVThey don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,
p263
aVand I have many questions and answer periods, and
p264
aVwhether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,
p265
aVor Oxford \u2014
p266
aVI've spoken at all of those universities.
p267
aVI'm going to Harvard in about three or four \u2014
p268
aVno, it's about two months from now \u2014
p269
aVto give a lecture.
p270
aVAnd I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked
p271
aVthe last few times I've been there.
p272
aVAnd it'll be on
p273
aVthese questions:
p274
aVwhere did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?
p275
aVWhat's life all about? Why am I here?
p276
aa(lp277
VEven if you have no religious belief,
p278
aVthere are times when you wonder that there's something else.
p279
aVThomas Edison also said,
p280
aV"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,
p281
aVand in the working of the universe,
p282
aVyou cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."
p283
aVI remember once,
p284
aVI sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev
p285
aVat a White House dinner.
p286
aVI went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.
p287
aVAnd I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,
p288
aVand they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.
p289
aVAnd I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,
p290
aVand I said,
p291
aV"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.
p292
aVWhat shall I talk to her about?"
p293
aVAnd he surprised me with the answer.
p294
aVHe said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.
p295
aVThat's what she's really interested in."
p296
aVI was a little bit surprised, but that evening
p297
aVthat's what we talked about,
p298
aVand it was a stimulating conversation.
p299
aVAnd afterward, she said,
p300
aV"You know, I'm an atheist,
p301
aVbut I know that there's something up there
p302
aVhigher than we are."
p303
aa(lp304
VThe second problem
p305
aVthat King David realized he could not solve
p306
aVwas the problem of human suffering.
p307
aVWriting the oldest book in the world was Job,
p308
aVand he said,
p309
aV"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."
p310
aVYes, to be sure, science has done much to push back
p311
aVcertain types of human suffering.
p312
aVBut I'm \u2014
p313
aVin a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.
p314
aVI admit that I'm very grateful
p315
aVfor all the medical advances
p316
aVthat have kept me in relatively good health
p317
aVall these years.
p318
aVMy doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me
p319
aVnot to take this trip out here to this \u2014 to be here.
p320
aVI haven't given a talk in nearly four months.
p321
aVAnd when you speak as much as I do,
p322
aVthree or four times a day,
p323
aVyou get rusty.
p324
aVThat's the reason I'm using this podium
p325
aVand using these notes.
p326
aVEvery time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,
p327
aVI'm ad-libbing.
p328
aVI'm not reading. I never read an address.
p329
aVI never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
p330
aVI talk ad lib.
p331
aVBut tonight, I've
p332
aVgot some notes here so that if
p333
aVI begin to forget,
p334
aVwhich I do sometimes,
p335
aVI've got something I can turn to.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut even here among us,
p338
aVmost \u2014
p339
aVin the most advanced society in the world,
p340
aVwe have poverty.
p341
aVWe have families that self-destruct,
p342
aVfriends that betray us.
p343
aVUnbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.
p344
aVI've never met a person in the world
p345
aVthat didn't have a problem
p346
aVor a worry.
p347
aVWhy do we suffer? It's an age-old question
p348
aVthat we haven't answered.
p349
aVYet David again and again said
p350
aVthat he would turn to God.
p351
aVHe said, "The Lord is my shepherd."
p352
aVThe final problem that David knew he could not solve
p353
aVwas death.
p354
aVMany commentators have said that death
p355
aVis the forbidden subject of our generation.
p356
aVMost people live as if
p357
aVthey're never going to die.
p358
aVTechnology projects the myth
p359
aVof control over our mortality.
p360
aVWe see people on our screens.
p361
aVMarilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen
p362
aVas she was in person,
p363
aVand our \u2014 many young people think she's still alive.
p364
aVThey don't know that she's dead.
p365
aVOr Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
p366
aVThe old stars, they come to life.
p367
aVAnd they're \u2014
p368
aVthey're just as great on that screen as they were in person.
p369
aVBut death is inevitable.
p370
aa(lp371
VI spoke some time ago to
p372
aVa joint session of Congress, last year.
p373
aVAnd we were meeting in that room,
p374
aVthe statue room.
p375
aVAbout 300 of them were there.
p376
aVAnd I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,
p377
aVall of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,
p378
aVor whoever."
p379
aVI said, "We're all going to die.
p380
aVAnd we have that in common with all these great men of the past
p381
aVthat are staring down at us."
p382
aVAnd it's often difficult for young people
p383
aVto understand that.
p384
aVIt's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.
p385
aVAs the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,
p386
aVhe said, there's every activity under heaven.
p387
aVThere's a time to be born,
p388
aVand there's a time to die.
p389
aVI've stood at the deathbed
p390
aVof several famous people,
p391
aVwhom you would know.
p392
aVI've talked to them.
p393
aVI've seen them in those agonizing moments
p394
aVwhen they were scared to death.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd yet, a few years earlier,
p397
aVdeath never crossed their mind.
p398
aVI talked to a woman this past week
p399
aVwhose father
p400
aVwas a famous doctor.
p401
aVShe said he never thought of God, never talked about God,
p402
aVdidn't believe in God. He was an atheist.
p403
aVBut she said,
p404
aVas he came to die,
p405
aVhe sat up on the side of the bed one day,
p406
aVand he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
p407
aVAnd he said, for the first time in his life
p408
aVhe'd thought about the inevitable,
p409
aVand about God.
p410
aVWas there a God?
p411
aVA few years ago, a university student asked me,
p412
aV"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"
p413
aVAnd I said, "The greatest surprise in my life
p414
aVis the brevity of life.
p415
aVIt passes so fast."
p416
aVBut it does not need to have to be that way.
p417
aVWernher von Braun,
p418
aVin the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:
p419
aV"science and religion are not antagonists.
p420
aVOn the contrary, they're sisters."
p421
aVHe put it on a personal basis.
p422
aVI knew Dr. von Braun very well.
p423
aVAnd he said, "Speaking for myself,
p424
aVI can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos
p425
aVserves only to confirm
p426
aVa belief in the certainty of a creator."
p427
aVHe also said,
p428
aV"In our search to know God,
p429
aVI've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ
p430
aVshould be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.
p431
aVThe reality of this life and His resurrection
p432
aVis the hope of mankind."
p433
aa(lp434
VI've done a lot of speaking in Germany
p435
aVand in France, and in different parts of the world \u2014
p436
aV105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.
p437
aVAnd I was invited one day to visit
p438
aVChancellor Adenauer,
p439
aVwho was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,
p440
aVsince the war.
p441
aVAnd he once \u2014 and he said to me,
p442
aVhe said, "Young man." He said,
p443
aV"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"
p444
aVAnd I said, "Sir, I do."
p445
aVHe said, "So do I."
p446
aVHe said, "When I leave office,
p447
aVI'm going to spend my time writing a book
p448
aVon why Jesus Christ rose again,
p449
aVand why it's so important to believe that."
p450
aVIn one of his plays,
p451
aVAlexander Solzhenitsyn
p452
aVdepicts a man dying,
p453
aVwho says to those gathered around his bed,
p454
aV"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret
p455
aVis when one is dying."
p456
aVHow should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?
p457
aa(lp458
VBlaise Pascal
p459
aVasked exactly that question
p460
aVin seventeenth-century France.
p461
aVPascal has been called the architect
p462
aVof modern civilization.
p463
aVHe was a brilliant scientist
p464
aVat the frontiers of mathematics,
p465
aVeven as a teenager.
p466
aVHe is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,
p467
aVand a creator of the first model of a computer.
p468
aVAnd of course, you are all familiar with
p469
aVthe computer language named for him.
p470
aVPascal explored in depth our human dilemmas
p471
aVof evil, suffering and death.
p472
aVHe was astounded
p473
aVat the phenomenon we've been considering:
p474
aVthat people can achieve extraordinary heights
p475
aVin science, the arts and human enterprise,
p476
aVyet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy
p477
aVand have \u2014 and self-hatreds.
p478
aVPascal saw us as a remarkable mixture
p479
aVof genius and self-delusion.
p480
aVOn November 23,
p481
aV1654,
p482
aVPascal had a profound religious experience.
p483
aVHe wrote in his journal these words:
p484
aV"I submit myself,
p485

VA French historian said,
p489
aVtwo centuries later,
p490
aV"Seldom has so mighty an intellect
p491
aVsubmitted with such humility
p492
aVto the authority of Jesus Christ."
p493
aVPascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God
p494
aVcould bring us back into harmony,
p495
aVbut he believed
p496
aVthat his own sins and failures could be forgiven,
p497
aVand that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.
p498
aVHe experienced it in a way that went beyond
p499
aVscientific observation and reason.
p500
aVIt was he who penned the well-known words,
p501
aV"The heart has its reasons,
p502
aVwhich reason knows not of."

VEqually well known is Pascal's Wager.
p505
aVEssentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,
p506
aVand open yourself to his love,
p507
aVyou lose nothing, even if you're wrong.
p508
aVBut if instead you bet that there is no God,
p509
aVthen you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."
p510
aVFor Pascal, scientific knowledge
p511
aVpaled beside the knowledge of God.
p512
aVThe knowledge of God was far beyond
p513
aVanything that ever crossed his mind.
p514
aVHe was ready to face him
p515
aVwhen he died at the age of 39.
p516
aVKing David lived to be 70,
p517
aVa long time in his era.
p518
aVYet he too had to face death,
p519
aVand he wrote these words:
p520
aV"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
p521
aVI will fear no evil,
p522
aVfor you are with me."
p523
aa(lp524
VThis was David's answer to three dilemmas
p525
aVof evil, suffering and death.
p526
aVIt can be yours, as well,
p527
aVas you seek the living God
p528
aVand allow him to fill your life
p529
aVand give you hope for the future.

aVWhen I was 17 years of age,
p531
aVI was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.
p532
aVI milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening
p533
aVwhen I came home from school.
p534
aVAnd there were 20 of them that I had \u2014
p535
aVthat I was responsible for,
p536
aVand I worked on the farm
p537
aVand tried to keep up with my studies.
p538
aVI didn't make good grades in high school.
p539
aVI didn't make them in college, until
p540
aVsomething happened in my heart.
p541
aa(lp542
VOne day, I was faced face-to-face
p543
aVwith Christ.
p544
aVHe said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
p545
aVCan you imagine that? "I am the truth.
p546
aVI'm the embodiment of all truth."
p547
aVHe was a liar.
p548
aVOr he was insane.
p549
aVOr he was what he claimed to be.
p550
aVWhich was he?
p551
aVI had to make that decision.
p552
aVI couldn't prove it.
p553
aVI couldn't take it to a laboratory
p554
aVand experiment with it.
p555
aVBut by faith I said, I believe him,
p556
aVand he came into my heart
p557
aVand changed my life.
p558
aVAnd now I'm ready,
p559
aVwhen I hear that call,
p560
aVto go into the presence of God.
p561
aVThank you, and God bless all of you.
