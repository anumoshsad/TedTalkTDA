VSo I'm a neurosurgeon.
p4
aVAnd like most of my colleagues,
p5
aVI have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.
p6
aVI realize how your life can change from one second to the other
p7
aVafter a major stroke or after a car accident.
p8
aVAnd what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons
p9
aVis to realize that unlike other organs of the body,
p10
aVthe brain has very little ability for self-repair.
p11
aVAnd after a major injury of your central nervous system,
p12
aVthe patients often remain with a severe handicap.
p13
aVAnd that's probably the reason why I've chosen
p14
aVto be a functional neurosurgeon.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat is a functional neurosurgeon?
p17
aVIt's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function
p18
aVthrough different surgical strategies.
p19
aVYou've certainly heard of one of the famous ones
p20
aVcalled deep brain stimulation,
p21
aVwhere you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain
p22
aVin order to modulate a circuit of neurons
p23
aVto improve a neurological function.
p24
aVIt's really an amazing technology
p25
aVin that it has improved the destiny of patients
p26
aVwith Parkinson's disease,
p27
aVwith severe tremor, with severe pain.
p28
aVHowever, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.
p29
aVAnd the dream of functional neurosurgeons
p30
aVis to repair the brain.
p31
aVI think
p32
aVthat we are approaching this dream.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I would like to show you
p35
aVthat we are very close to this.
p36
aVAnd that with a little bit of help,
p37
aVthe brain is able to help itself.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo the story started 15 years ago.
p40
aVAt that time, I was a chief resident
p41
aVworking days and nights in the emergency room.
p42
aVI often had to take care of patients with head trauma.
p43
aVYou have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma,
p44
aVhis brain is swelling
p45
aVand he's increasing his intracranial pressure.
p46
aVAnd in order to save his life,
p47
aVyou have to decrease this intracranial pressure.
p48
aVAnd to do that,
p49
aVyou sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.
p50
aVSo instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain,
p51
aVwe decided with Jean-François Brunet,
p52
aVwho is a colleague of mine, a biologist,
p53
aVto study them.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhat do I mean by that?
p56
aVWe wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.
p57
aVIt's not an easy task.
p58
aVGrowing cells from a piece of tissue
p59
aVis a bit the same as growing very small children
p60
aVout from their family.
p61
aVSo you need to find the right nutrients,
p62
aVthe warmth, the humidity
p63
aVand all the nice environments to make them thrive.
p64
aVSo that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
p65
aVAnd after many attempts,
p66
aVJean-François did it.
p67
aVAnd that's what he saw under his microscope.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd that was, for us, a major surprise.
p70
aVWhy?
p71
aVBecause this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture,
p72
aVwith large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.
p73
aVAnd you may remember from biology class
p74
aVthat stem cells are immature cells,
p75
aVable to turn into any type of cell of the body.
p76
aVThe adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare
p77
aVand they're located in deep and small niches
p78
aVin the depths of the brain.
p79
aVSo it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture
p80
aVfrom the superficial part of swollen brain we had
p81
aVin the operating theater.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd there was another intriguing observation:
p84
aVRegular stem cells are very active cells \u2014
p85
aVcells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.
p86
aVAnd they never die, they're immortal cells.
p87
aVBut these cells behave differently.
p88
aVThey divide slowly,
p89
aVand after a few weeks of culture,
p90
aVthey even died.
p91
aVSo we were in front of a strange new cell population
p92
aVthat looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd it took us a long time to understand where they came from.
p95
aVThey come from these cells.
p96
aVThese blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
p97
aVAll of you have them in your brain.
p98
aVThey represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.
p99
aVThey have a very important role during the development stage.
p100
aVWhen you were fetuses,
p101
aVthey helped your brain to fold itself.
p102
aVBut why do they stay in your head?
p103
aVThis, we don't know.
p104
aVWe think that they may participate in brain repair
p105
aVbecause we find them in higher concentration
p106
aVclose to brain lesions.
p107
aVBut it's not so sure.
p108
aVBut there is one clear thing \u2014
p109
aVthat from these cells,
p110
aVwe got our stem cell culture.
p111
aVAnd we were in front of a potential new source of cells
p112
aVto repair the brain.
p113
aVAnd we had to prove this.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo to prove it,
p116
aVwe decided to design an experimental paradigm.
p117
aVThe idea was to biopsy a piece of brain
p118
aVin a non-eloquent area of the brain,
p119
aVand then to culture the cells
p120
aVexactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.
p121
aVAnd then label them, to put color in them
p122
aVin order to be able to track them in the brain.
p123
aVAnd the last step was to re-implant them
p124
aVin the same individual.
p125
aVWe call these
p126
aVautologous grafts \u2014 autografts.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo the first question we had,
p129
aV"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain,
p130
aVand what will happen if we re-implant the same cells
p131
aVin a lesioned brain?"
p132
aVThanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller,
p133
aVwe worked with monkeys.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo in the first-case scenario,
p136
aVwe re-implanted the cells in the normal brain
p137
aVand what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks,
p138
aVas if they were taken from the brain,
p139
aVthey go back home,
p140
aVthe space is already busy,
p141
aVthey are not needed there, so they disappear.
p142
aa(lp143
VIn the second-case scenario,
p144
aVwe performed the lesion,
p145
aVwe re-implanted exactly the same cells,
p146
aVand in this case, the cells remained \u2014
p147
aVand they became mature neurons.
p148
aVAnd that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.
p149
aVThose are the cells that were re-implanted.
p150
aVAnd the proof they carry,
p151
aVthese little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled
p152
aVin vitro, when they were in culture.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut we could not stop here, of course.
p155
aVDo these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?
p156
aVSo for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.
p157
aVThey had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.
p158
aVThey were very good at it.
p159
aVAnd when they had reached a plateau of performance,
p160
aVwe did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.
p161
aVSo the monkeys were plegic,
p162
aVthey could not move their hand anymore.
p163
aVAnd exactly the same as humans would do,
p164
aVthey spontaneously recovered to a certain extent,
p165
aVexactly the same as after a stroke.
p166
aVPatients are completely plegic,
p167
aVand then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism,
p168
aVthey recover to a certain extent,
p169
aVexactly the same for the monkey.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau
p172
aVof spontaneous recovery,
p173
aVwe implanted his own cells.
p174
aVSo on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.
p175
aVHe's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance
p176
aVbefore the lesion.
p177
aVHe's not so accurate, not so quick.
p178
aVAnd look now when we re-implant the cells:
p179
aVTwo months after re-implantation, the same individual.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VIt was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.
p184
aVSince that time, we've understood much more about these cells.
p185
aVWe know that we can cryopreserve them,
p186
aVwe can use them later on.
p187
aVWe know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models,
p188
aVlike Parkinson's disease, for example.
p189
aVBut our dream is still to implant them in humans.
p190
aVAnd I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon
p191
aVthat the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.
p192
aa(lp193
VThank you.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VBruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,
p198
aVand I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience,
p199
aVpossibly even a majority,
p200
aVwho are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."
p201
aVI do, in any case.
p202
aVAnd of course the question is,
p203
aVwhat are the biggest obstacles
p204
aVbefore you can go into human clinical trials?
p205
aa(lp206
VJocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)
p207
aVSo, from these exciting results, you need to fill out
p208
aVabout two kilograms of papers and forms
p209
aVto be able to go through these kind of trials.
p210
aa(lp211
VBG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.
p212
aa(lp213
VJB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time
p214
aVand a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
p215
aa(lp216
VBG: If you project yourself \u2014
p217
aVhaving done the research
p218
aVand having tried to get permission to start the trials,
p219
aVif you project yourself out in time,
p220
aVhow many years before somebody gets into a hospital
p221
aVand this therapy is available?
p222
aa(lp223
VJB: So, it's very difficult to say.
p224
aVIt depends, first, on the approval of the trial.
p225
aVWill the regulation allow us to do it soon?
p226
aVAnd then, you have to perform this kind of study
p227
aVin a small group of patients.
p228
aVSo it takes, already, a long time to select the patients,
p229
aVdo the treatment
p230
aVand evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.
p231
aVAnd then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.
p232
aVYou have to really prove first that it's useful
p233
aVbefore offering this treatment up for everybody.
p234
aa(lp235
VBG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.
p236
aa(lp237
VBG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.
p238
aVBG: Thank you.
