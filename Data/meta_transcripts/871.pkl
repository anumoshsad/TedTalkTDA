VI want to talk about
p4
aVwhat we learn from conservatives.
p5
aVAnd I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,
p6
aVso I want to confess to you
p7
aVthat when I was a kid,
p8
aVindeed, I was a conservative.
p9
aVI was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,
p10
aVa leader in the Teenage Republicans.
p11
aVIndeed, I was the youngest member
p12
aVof any delegation
p13
aVin the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan
p14
aVto be the Republican nominee for president.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, I know what you're thinking.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVYou're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."
p19
aVYou're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."
p20
aVAnd indeed, this is just one of the examples
p21
aVof the junk that flows across the tubes
p22
aVin these Internets here.
p23
aVWikipedia reports that this guy,
p24
aVthis former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania
p25
aVwas, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people
p26
aVat the Republican National Convention,
p27
aVbut it's just not true.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVIndeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aVAll right. Okay, so ... perfect.
p33
aVPerfect.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVOkay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
p36
aVOkay.
p37
aVFinally, truth will be brought here.
p38
aVOkay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.
p39
aV"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.
p40
aVThat's it. Please save this.
p41
aVGreat, here we go.
p42
aVAnd ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
p43
aVOkay, but no, this is really besides the point.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Applause)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives \u2014
p48
aVnot so much this issue of the 1980 convention \u2014
p49
aVthe thing to think about is this:
p50
aVThey go to church.
p51
aVNow, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
p52
aVI'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
p53
aVAnd I'm not talking about the God thing.
p54
aVI don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.
p55
aVThey go to church, by which I mean,
p56
aVthey do lots of things for free for each other.
p57
aVThey hold potluck dinners.
p58
aVIndeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
p59
aVThey serve food to poor people.
p60
aVThey share, they give,
p61
aVthey give away for free.
p62
aVAnd it's the very same people
p63
aVleading Wall Street firms
p64
aVwho, on Sundays, show up
p65
aVand share.
p66
aVAnd not only food, right.
p67
aa(lp68
VThese very same people
p69
aVare strong believers, in lots of contexts,
p70
aVin the limits on the markets.
p71
aVThey are in many important places
p72
aVagainst markets.
p73
aVIndeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
p74
aVBut they're very keen that we don't
p75
aVlet money drop into that relationship,
p76
aVelse it turns into something like this.
p77
aVThey want to regulate us, those conservatives,
p78
aVto stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
p79
aVBecause they understand:
p80
aVThere are places for the market
p81
aVand places where the market should not exist,
p82
aVwhere we should be free
p83
aVto enjoy the fellowship of others.
p84
aVThey recognize: Both of these things have to live together.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd the second great thing about conservatives:
p87
aVthey get ecology.
p88
aVRight, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century
p89
aVwho taught us about
p90
aVenvironmental thinking \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt.
p91
aVThey first taught us about ecology
p92
aVin the context of natural resources.
p93
aVAnd then they began to teach us in the context of
p94
aVinnovation, economics.
p95
aVThey understand, in that context,
p96
aV"free." They understand "free" is an important
p97
aVessential part of the
p98
aVcultural ecology as well.
p99
aVThat's the thing I want you to think about them.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, I know
p102
aVyou don't believe me, really, here.
p103
aVSo here's exhibit number one.
p104
aVI want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,
p105
aVa libertarian who works at the, for many people,
p106
aV"evil" Cato Institute.
p107
aVOkay, so Julian made this video.
p108
aVHe's a terrible producer of videos,
p109
aVbut it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
p110
aVSo here he is beginning.
p111
aa(lp112
VJulian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way
p113
aVremix culture seems to be evolving ...
p114
aa(lp115
VLarry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us
p116
aVabout these three videos.
p117
aVThis is this fantastic Brat Pack remix
p118
aVset to Lisztomania.
p119
aVWhich, of course, spread virally.
p120
aVHugely successful.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Music)
p123
aVAnd then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
p124
aVThey decided they wanted to do the same.
p125
aV(Music)
p126
aVAnd then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
p127
aVAnd San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.
p128
aV(Music)
p129
aVAnd so they're beautiful, but this libertarian
p130
aVhas some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.
p131
aVHere's lesson number one.
p132
aa(lp133
VJS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.
p134
aVThey are acting in the sense that they're
p135
aVemulating the original mashup.
p136
aVAnd the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye
p137
aVand some experience with video editing.
p138
aVBut this is also basically just a group of friends
p139
aVhaving an authentic social moment
p140
aVand screwing around together.
p141
aVIt should feel familiar and kind of resonate
p142
aVfor anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party
p143
aVwith a group of good friends.
p144
aa(lp145
VLL: Or ...
p146
aa(lp147
VJS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at
p148
aVbecause here, remix isn't just about
p149
aVan individual doing something alone in his basement;
p150
aVit becomes an act of social creativity.
p151
aVAnd it's not just that it yields
p152
aVa different kind of product at the end,
p153
aVit's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.
p154
aVAll of our normal social interactions
p155
aVbecome a kind of invitation
p156
aVto this sort of collective expression.
p157
aVIt's our real social lives themselves
p158
aVthat are transmuted into art.
p159
aa(lp160
VLL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
p161
aa(lp162
VJS: One remix is about
p163
aVindividuals using our shared culture
p164
aVas a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
p165
aVStage two, social remix,
p166
aVis really about using it to mediate
p167
aVpeople's relationships to each other.
p168
aVFirst, within each video,
p169
aVthe Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template
p170
aVfor performing the social reality of each group.
p171
aVBut there's also a dialogue between the videos,
p172
aVwhere, once the basic structure is established,
p173
aVit becomes a kind of platform
p174
aVfor articulating the similarities and differences
p175
aVbetween the groups' social and physical worlds.
p176
aa(lp177
VLL: And then, here's for me,
p178
aVthe critical key to what
p179
aVJulian has to say ...
p180
aa(lp181
VJS: Copyright policy isn't just about
p182
aVhow to incentivize the production
p183
aVof a certain kind of artistic commodity;
p184
aVit's about what level of control
p185
aVwe're going to permit to be exercised
p186
aVover our social realities \u2014
p187
aVsocial realities that are now inevitably
p188
aVpermeated by pop culture.
p189
aVI think it's important that we
p190
aVkeep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.
p191
aVIf we're only focused on how to maximize
p192
aVthe supply of one,
p193
aVI think we risk suppressing
p194
aVthis different and richer
p195
aVand, in some ways, maybe even more important one.
p196
aa(lp197
VLL: Right. Bingo. Point.
p198
aVFreedom needs this opportunity
p199
aVto both have the commercial success
p200
aVof the great commercial works
p201
aVand the opportunity
p202
aVto build this different kind of culture.
p203
aVAnd for that to happen, you need
p204
aVideas like fair use to be central and protected,
p205
aVto enable this kind of innovation,
p206
aVas this libertarian tells us,
p207
aVbetween these two creative cultures,
p208
aVa commercial and a sharing culture.
p209
aVThe point is they, he, here,
p210
aVgets that culture.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, my concern is, we Dems,
p213
aVtoo often, not so much.
p214
aVAll right, take for example this great company.
p215
aVIn the good old days when this Republican ran that company,
p216
aVtheir greatest work was work that built on the past, right.
p217
aVAll of the great Disney works
p218
aVwere works that took works that
p219
aVwere in the public domain and remixed them,
p220
aVor waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,
p221
aVto celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
p222
aVIndeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,
p223
aVas "Steamboat Willie,"
p224
aVis a remix of the then, very dominant,
p225
aVvery popular "Steamboat Bill"
p226
aVby Buster Keaton.
p227
aVThis man was a remixer extraordinaire.
p228
aVHe is the celebration and ideal
p229
aVof exactly this kind of creativity.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut then the company passes
p232
aVthrough this dark stage
p233
aVto this Democrat.
p234
aVWildly different.
p235
aVThis is the mastermind behind
p236
aVthe eventual passage of what we call
p237
aVthe Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
p238
aVextending the term of existing copyrights
p239
aVby 20 years,
p240
aVso that no one could do to Disney
p241
aVwhat Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
p242
aVNow, when we tried to challenge this,
p243
aVgoing to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there \u2014
p244
aVif we could get them to wake up to this \u2014 to strike it down,
p245
aVwe had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners
p246
aVincluding this right-wing
p247
aVNobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,
p248
aVwho said he would join our brief
p249
aVonly if the word "no brainer"
p250
aVwas in the brief somewhere.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVBut apparently, no brains
p253
aVexisted in this place
p254
aVwhen Democrats passed and signed
p255
aVthis bill into law.
p256
aVNow, tiny little quibble of a footnote:
p257
aVSonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,
p258
aVbut I don't buy it.
p259
aVThis guy is no Republican.
p260
aa(lp261
VOkay, for a second example,
p262
aVthink about this cultural hero,
p263
aVicon on the Left,
p264
aVcreator of this character.
p265
aVLook at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,
p266
aVinviting people to come and use their creative energy
p267
aVto produce a new generation of attention
p268
aVtowards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.
p269
aVRead the license.
p270
aVThe license for these remixers
p271
aVassigns all of the rights
p272
aVto the remix back to Lucas.
p273
aVThe mashup is owned by Lucas.
p274
aVIndeed, anything you add to the mashup,
p275
aVmusic you might add,
p276
aVLucas has a worldwide perpetual right
p277
aVto exploit that for free.
p278
aVThere is no creator here to be recognized.
p279
aVThe creator doesn't have any rights.
p280
aVThe creator is a sharecropper in this story.
p281
aVAnd we should remember
p282
aVwho employed the sharecroppers:
p283
aVthe Democrats, right?
p284
aa(lp285
VSo the point is the Republicans here
p286
aVrecognize that there's a certain need
p287
aVof ownership,
p288
aVa respect for ownership,
p289
aVthe respect we should give the creator,
p290
aVthe remixer, the owner, the property owner,
p291
aVthe copyright owner
p292
aVof this extraordinarily powerful stuff,
p293
aVand not a generation of sharecroppers.
p294
aVNow, I think there are lessons we should learn here,
p295
aVlessons about openness.
p296
aVOur lives are sharing activities,
p297
aVat least in part.
p298
aVEven for the head of Goldman Sachs,
p299
aVat least in part.
p300
aVAnd for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have
p301
aVwell-protected spaces of fair use.
p302
aa(lp303
VThat's number one. Number two:
p304
aVThis ecology of sharing
p305
aVneeds freedom
p306
aVwithin which to create.
p307
aVFreedom, which means without permission from anyone,
p308
aVthe ability to create.
p309
aVAnd number three: We need to
p310
aVrespect the creator,
p311
aVthe creator of these remixes
p312
aVthrough rights that are
p313
aVdirectly tied to them.
p314
aVNow, this explains the right-wing nonprofit
p315
aVCreative Commons.
p316
aVActually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,
p317
aVbut of course \u2014 let me just tie it here \u2014
p318
aVthe Creative Commons, which is
p319
aVoffering authors this simple way to mark their content
p320
aVwith the freedoms
p321
aVthey intended to carry.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo that we go from a "all rights reserved" world
p324
aVto a "some rights reserved" world
p325
aVso that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,
p326
aVbuilding and creating
p327
aVon the basis of this
p328
aVcreative copyrighted work.
p329
aVThese tools that we built
p330
aVenable this sharing in parts
p331
aVthrough licenses that make it clear
p332
aVand a freedom to create
p333
aVwithout requiring permission first
p334
aVbecause the permission has already been granted
p335
aVand a respect for the creator because it builds upon
p336
aVa copyright the creator
p337
aVhas licensed freely.
p338
aVAnd it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
p339
aVthat's obviously developed around these licenses,
p340
aVas now more than 350 million digital objects
p341
aVare out there, licensed freely
p342
aVin this way.
p343
aa(lp344
VNow that picture of an ecology of creativity,
p345
aVthe picture of an ecology
p346
aVof balanced creativity,
p347
aVis that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
p348
aVWell, as you all know,
p349
aVnot many of us believe we do.
p350
aVI tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity
p351
aVjust last week.
p352
aVI created a video which was based
p353
aVon a Wireside Chat that I'd given,
p354
aVand I uploaded it to YouTube.
p355
aVI then got this email from YouTube
p356
aVweirdly notifying me
p357
aVthat there was content in that
p358
aVowned by the mysterious WMG
p359
aVthat matched their content ID.
p360
aVSo I didn't think much about it.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd then on Twitter, somebody said to me,
p363
aV"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"
p364
aVimagining that I had this deep conspiracy
p365
aVto reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
p366
aVI answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
p367
aVBut then I went to the site
p368
aVand all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
p369
aVMy whole 45-minute video
p370
aVhad been silenced
p371
aVbecause there were snippets in that video,
p372
aVa video about fair use,
p373
aVthat included Warner Music Group music.
p374
aVNow, interestingly,
p375
aVthey still sold ads for that music,
p376
aVif you played the silent video.
p377
aVYou could still buy the music,
p378
aVbut you couldn't hear anything
p379
aVbecause it had been silenced.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo I did what the current regime
p382
aVsays I must do
p383
aVto be free to use
p384
aVYouTube to talk about fair use.
p385
aVI went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
p386
aVAnd then in an extraordinarily
p387
aVBart Simpson-like, juvenile way
p388
aVyou've actually got to type out these words
p389
aVand get them right
p390
aVto reassert your freedom to speak.
p391
aVAnd I felt like I was in third grade again.
p392
aV"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
p393
aVI will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
p394
aVThis is absurd.
p395
aVIt is outrageous.
p396
aVIt is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom
p397
aVwe should be encouraging.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?
p400
aVWell, interestingly, in the last presidential election,
p401
aVwho was the number one, active
p402
aVopponent of this system of regulation
p403
aVin online speech?
p404
aVJohn McCain.
p405
aVLetter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal
p406
aVto be more respectful of fair use
p407
aVwith their extraordinary notice and take down system,
p408
aVthat led his campaign so many times
p409
aVto be thrown off the Internet.
p410
aa(lp411
VNow, that was the story of me then,
p412
aVmy good old days of right-wing lunacy.
p413
aVLet me come back to now,
p414
aVnow when I'm a little leftist \u2014
p415
aVI'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty \u2014
p416
aVAnd I wonder, can we on the Left
p417
aVexpect to build this
p418
aVecology of freedom, now,
p419
aVin a world where
p420
aVwe know the extraordinarily powerful
p421
aVinfluences against it,
p422
aVwhere even icons of the Left like this
p423
aVentertain and push bills
p424
aVthat would effectively ban the requirement
p425
aVof open access for government-funded research?
p426
aVThe president, who has supported
p427
aVa process that secretly negotiates agreements,
p428
aVwhich effectively lock us into the insane system
p429
aVof DMCA
p430
aVthat we have adopted
p431
aVand likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out
p432
aVthat, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.
p433
aVNot a single example of reform
p434
aVhas been produced yet.
p435
aVAnd we're not going to see this change
p436
aVin this system
p437
aVanytime soon.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo here's the lessons of openness
p440
aVthat I think we need to learn.
p441
aVOpenness is a commitment
p442
aVto a certain set of values.
p443
aVWe need to speak of those values.
p444
aVThe value of freedom. It's a value of community.
p445
aVIt's a value of the limits in regulation.
p446
aVIt's a value respecting the creator.
p447
aVNow, if we can learn those values
p448
aVfrom at least some influences on the Right,
p449
aVif we can take them and incorporate them,
p450
aVmaybe we could do a little trade.
p451
aVWe learn those values on the Left,
p452
aVand maybe they'll do health care
p453
aVor global warming legislation or something in the Right.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnyway, please join me
p456
aVin teaching these values.
p457
aa(lp458
VThank you very much.
