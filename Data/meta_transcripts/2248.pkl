VIn June of 1998,
p4
aVTori Murden McClure left Nags Head, North Carolina for France.
p5
aa(lp6
VThat's her boat, the American Pearl.
p7
aVIt's 23 feet long and just six feet across
p8
aVat its widest point.
p9
aVThe deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.
p10
aVTori and her friends built it by hand,
p11
aVand it weighed about 1,800 pounds.
p12
aVHer plan was to row it alone
p13
aVacross the Atlantic Ocean \u2014
p14
aVno motor, no sail \u2014
p15
aVsomething no woman and no American had ever done before.
p16
aVThis would be her route:
p17
aVover 3,600 miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean.
p18
aa(lp19
VProfessionally, Tori worked as a project administrator
p20
aVfor the city of Louisville, Kentucky,
p21
aVher hometown,
p22
aVbut her real passion was exploring.
p23
aVThis was not her first big expedition.
p24
aVSeveral years earlier, she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole.
p25
aVShe was an accomplished rower in college,
p26
aVeven competed for a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,
p27
aVbut this, this was different.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure: Hi. It's Sunday, July 5.
p30
aVSector time 9 a.m.
p31
aVSo that's Kentucky time now.
p32
aa(lp33
VDawn Landes: Tori made these videos as she rowed.
p34
aVThis is her 21st day at sea.
p35
aVAt this point, she'd covered over 1,000 miles,
p36
aVhad had no radio contact in more than two weeks
p37
aVfollowing a storm that disabled all her long-range communications systems
p38
aVjust five days in.
p39
aVMost days looked like this.
p40
aVAt this point, she'd rowed over 200,000 strokes,
p41
aVfighting the current and the wind.
p42
aVSome days, she traveled as little as 15 feet.
p43
aVYeah.
p44
aVAnd as frustrating as those days were,
p45
aVother days were like this.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Video) TMM: And I want to show you my little friends.
p48
aa(lp49
VDL: She saw fish, dolphins,
p50
aVwhales, sharks,
p51
aVand even some sea turtles.
p52
aVAfter two weeks with no human contact,
p53
aVTori was able to contact a local cargo ship
p54
aVvia VHF radio.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Video) TMM: Do you guys have a weather report, over?
p57
aa(lp58
VMan: Heading up to a low
p59
aVahead of you but it's heading,
p60
aVand you're obviously going northeast
p61
aVand there's a high behind us.
p62
aVThat'd be coming
p63
aVeast-northeast also.
p64
aa(lp65
VTMM: Good.
p66
aa(lp67
VDL: She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Video) TMM: So weather report says nothing dramatic
p70
aVis going to happen soon.
p71
aa(lp72
VDL: What the weather report didn't tell her
p73
aVwas that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle
p74
aVin the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.
p77
aVThere's a very strong wind from the east now.
p78
aVIt's blowing about.
p79
aVIt's blowing!
p80
aVAfter 12 days of storm
p81
aVI get to row for four hours
p82
aVwithout a flagging wind.
p83
aVI'm not very happy right now.
p84
aVAs happy as I was this morning,
p85
aVI am unhappy now, so ...
p86
aa(lp87
VDL: After nearly three months at sea,
p88
aVshe'd covered over 3,000 miles.
p89
aVShe was two thirds of the way there,
p90
aVbut in the storm, the waves were the size of a seven-story building.
p91
aVHer boat kept capsizing.
p92
aVSome of them were pitchpole capsizes, flipping her end over end,
p93
aVand rowing became impossible.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.
p96
aVI'm in something big, bad and ugly.
p97
aVTwo capsizes.
p98
aVLast capsize, I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back.
p99
aVI've had about six capsizes now.
p100
aVThe last one was a pitchpole.
p101
aVI have the Argus beacon with me.
p102
aVI would set off the distress signal,
p103
aVbut quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat.
p104
aVIt's so far underwater right now,
p105
aVthe only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin.
p106
aVIt's about 10 a.m.
p107
aVI've lost track of the number of capsizes.
p108
aVI seem to capsize about every 15 minutes.
p109
aVI think I may have broken my left arm.
p110
aVThe waves
p111
aVare tearing the boat to shreds.
p112
aVI keep praying because
p113
aVI'm not sure I'm going to make it through this.
p114
aVDL: Tori set off her distress beacon
p115
aVand was rescued by a passing container ship.
p116
aVThey found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France.
p117
aVI read about it in the newspaper.
p118
aa(lp119
VIn 1998, I was a high school student living in Louisville, Kentucky.
p120
aVNow, I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter.
p121
aVAnd her bravery stuck with me, and I'm adapting her story
p122
aVinto a musical called "Row."
p123
aVWhen Tori returned home,
p124
aVshe was feeling disheartened,
p125
aVshe was broke.
p126
aVShe was having a hard time making the transition
p127
aVback into civilization.
p128
aa(lp129
VIn this scene, she sits at home.
p130
aVThe phone is ringing, her friends are calling,
p131
aVbut she doesn't know how to talk to them.
p132
aVShe sings this song. It's called "Dear Heart."
p133
aa(lp134
V(Guitar)
p135
aa(lp136
VWhen I was dreaming,
p137
aa(lp138
VI took my body
p139
aa(lp140
Vto beautiful places
p141
aa(lp142
VI'd never been.
p143
aa(lp144
VI saw Gibraltar,
p145
aa(lp146
Vand stars of Kentucky
p147
aa(lp148
Vburned in the moonlight,
p149
aa(lp150
Vmaking me smile.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd when I awoke here,
p153
aa(lp154
Vthe sky was so cloudy.
p155
aa(lp156
VI walked to a party
p157
aa(lp158
Vwhere people I know
p159
aa(lp160
Vtry hard to know me
p161
aa(lp162
Vand ask where I've been,
p163
aa(lp164
Vbut I can't explain
p165
aa(lp166
Vwhat I've seen to them.
p167
aa(lp168
VAh, listen, dear heart.
p169
aa(lp170
VJust pay attention,
p171
aa(lp172
Vgo right from the start.
p173
aa(lp174
VAh, listen, dear heart.
p175
aa(lp176
VYou can fall off the map,
p177
aa(lp178
Vbut don't fall apart.
p179
aa(lp180
VOoh ooh ooh,
p181
aa(lp182
Vah ah ah ah ah.
p183
aa(lp184
VAh ah,
p185
aa(lp186
Vah ah ah.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhen I was out there,
p189
aa(lp190
Vthe ocean would hold me,
p191
aa(lp192
Vrock me and throw me,
p193
aa(lp194
Vlight as a child.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut now I'm so heavy,
p197
aa(lp198
Vnothing consoles me.
p199
aa(lp200
VMy mind floats like driftwood,
p201
aa(lp202
Vwayward and wild.
p203
aa(lp204
VAh, listen, dear heart.
p205
aa(lp206
VJust pay attention,
p207
aa(lp208
Vgo right from the start.
p209
aa(lp210
VAh, listen, dear heart.
p211
aa(lp212
VYou can fall off the map,
p213
aa(lp214
Vbut don't fall apart.
p215
aa(lp216
VOoh.
p217
aa(lp218
VEventually, Tori starts to get her feet under her.
p219
aVShe starts hanging out with her friends again.
p220
aVShe meets a guy and falls in love for the first time.
p221
aVShe gets a new job working for another Louisville native,
p222
aVMuhammad Ali.
p223
aVOne day, at lunch with her new boss,
p224
aVTori shares the news that two other women
p225
aVare setting out to row across the mid-Atlantic,
p226
aVto do something that she almost died trying to do.
p227
aa(lp228
VHis response was classic Ali:
p229
aV"You don't want to go through life
p230
aVas the woman who almost rowed across the ocean."
p231
aa(lp232
VHe was right.
p233
aVTori rebuilt the American Pearl,
p234
aVand in December of 1999,
p235
aVshe did it.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause) (Guitar)
