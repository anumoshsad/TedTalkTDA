VI believe big institutions
p4
aVhave unique potential to create change,
p5
aVand I believe that we as individuals
p6
aVhave unique power
p7
aVto influence the direction that those institutions take.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, these beliefs did not come naturally to me,
p10
aVbecause trusting big institutions,
p11
aVnot really part of my family legacy.
p12
aVMy mother escaped North Korea
p13
aVwhen she was 10 years old.
p14
aVTo do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life:
p15
aVrepressive governments, occupying armies
p16
aVand even armed border patrols.
p17
aVLater, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States,
p18
aVshe had to defy an entire culture
p19
aVthat said the girls would never be the best and brightest.
p20
aVOnly because her name happens to sound like a boy's
p21
aVwas she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam
p22
aVto come to the United States.
p23
aa(lp24
VBecause of her bravery and passion,
p25
aVI've had all the opportunities that she never did,
p26
aVand that has made my story so different.
p27
aVInstead of running away from big institutions,
p28
aVI've actually run toward them.
p29
aVI've had the chance over the course of my career
p30
aVto work for The Wall Street Journal,
p31
aVthe White House
p32
aVand now one of the largest financial institutions in the world,
p33
aVwhere I lead sustainable investing.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, these institutions are like tankers,
p36
aVand working inside of them,
p37
aVI've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave,
p38
aVand I've become convinced
p39
aVthat the institution of the global capital markets,
p40
aVthe nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world,
p41
aVthat that may be one of our most powerful forces
p42
aVfor positive social change at our disposal,
p43
aVif we ask it to be.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, I know some of you are thinking,
p46
aVglobal capital markets, positive social change,
p47
aVnot usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.
p48
aVI think many people think of the capital markets
p49
aVkind of like an ocean.
p50
aVIt's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature
p51
aVthat is not affected by our wishes or desires.
p52
aVSo the best that our little savings accounts
p53
aVor retirement accounts can do
p54
aVis to try to catch some waves in the good cycles
p55
aVand hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones,
p56
aVbut certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts
p57
aVdon't affect the tides,
p58
aVdon't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut why is that?
p61
aVBecause actually, one third of this ocean of capital
p62
aVactually belongs to individuals like us,
p63
aVand most of the rest of the capital markets
p64
aVis controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority
p65
aVand their capital from us,
p66
aVas members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
p67
aVSo if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets,
p68
aVwhy aren't we able to make our voices heard?
p69
aVWhy can't we make some waves?
p70
aa(lp71
VSo let me ask you a different question:
p72
aVdid any of you buy fair trade coffee
p73
aVthe last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?
p74
aVOK. Do any of you go to the restaurant
p75
aVand order the sustainably farmed trout
p76
aVinstead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass
p77
aVthat you really wish you could have?
p78
aVDo any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
p79
aa(lp80
VSo why do we do these things?
p81
aVRight? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion
p82
aVcombustion engine vehicles.
p83
aVOne fish is just one fish in the sea.
p84
aVAnd one cup of coffee
p85
aVdoesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
p86
aVBut we do these things because we believe they matter,
p87
aVthat our actions add up,
p88
aVthat our choices might influence others
p89
aVand collectively, what an impact we can have.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.
p92
aVIt's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.
p93
aVLook at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
p94
aa(lp95
V"This one cup can be used again and again."
p96
aa(lp97
V"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."
p98
aa(lp99
V"This one cup helps save the planet."
p100
aVI had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VSo why do we think that our choice
p105
aVof a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee
p106
aVin a reusable mug matters,
p107
aVbut what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account
p108
aVfor our IRA doesn't?
p109
aVWhy can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets
p110
aVthat we care,
p111
aVthat we care about fair labor standards,
p112
aVthat we care about sustainable production methods
p113
aVand about healthy communities?
p114
aVWhy aren't we voting with our investment dollars,
p115
aVbut we would vote with our lattes?
p116
aa(lp117
VSo I think it has something to do with the myths,
p118
aVthe fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.
p119
aVDo you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?
p120
aVIf you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil,"
p121
aVit would fill up with sweet porridge.
p122
aVAnd if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"
p123
aVit would stop.
p124
aVBut if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen,
p125
aVand things could go terribly awry.
p126
aVSo I think when it comes to markets,
p127
aVwe have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.
p128
aVWe believe that the markets is this magic pot
p129
aVthat obeys only one command:
p130
aVmake more money.
p131
aVOnly those words said exactly that way
p132
aVwill make the pot fill up with gold.
p133
aVAdd in some extra words like "protect the environment,"
p134
aVthe spell might not work.
p135
aVPut in the wrong words like "promote social justice,"
p136
aVand you might see your gold coins shrink
p137
aVor even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo we asked people, what do you really think?
p140
aVAnd we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors,
p141
aVand we found something fascinating.
p142
aVOverwhelmingly,
p143
aVpeople wanted to add those extra words into the formula.
p144
aV71 percent of people said yes,
p145
aVthey were interested in sustainable investing,
p146
aVwhich we define as taking the best in class investment process
p147
aVthat you already have traditionally
p148
aVand adding in the extra information you get
p149
aVwhen you think about the environment and society and good governance.
p150
aV71 percent wanted that.
p151
aV72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that
p152
aVwould actually do better financially.
p153
aVSo people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.
p154
aVBut here was the weird thing:
p155
aV54 percent of the people
p156
aVstill said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks,
p157
aVthey thought that they would make less money.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo is it true?
p160
aVDo you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee
p161
aVinstead of drinking it?
p162
aVWell, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees
p163
aVor Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so.
p164
aVRight? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies
p165
aVthat ended up becoming so popular with consumers
p166
aVthat the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them
p167
aVfor hundreds of millions of dollars
p168
aVeach.
p169
aVBut here's the important thing.
p170
aVThose corporations realized
p171
aVthat if they wanted to protect the value of their investments,
p172
aVthey had to preserve that socially conscious mission.
p173
aVIf they didn't keep adding in those extra words
p174
aVof environmentally friendly and socially conscious,
p175
aVthose brands wouldn't make more money.
p176
aa(lp177
VBut maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?
p178
aVThe serious companies that fund our economy
p179
aVand that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round,
p180
aVthey need to stick to making more money.
p181
aVSo, Harvard Business School actually researched this,
p182
aVand they found something fascinating.
p183
aVIf you had invested a dollar 20 years ago
p184
aVin a portfolio of companies
p185
aVthat focused narrowly on making more money
p186
aVquarter by quarter,
p187
aVthat one dollar
p188
aVwould have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
p189
aVThat's not bad until you consider
p190
aVthat if instead you'd invested that same dollar
p191
aVin a portfolio of companies
p192
aVthat focused on growing their business
p193
aVand on the most important environmental and social issues,
p194
aVthat one dollar would have grown
p195
aVto 28 dollars and 36 cents.
p196
aValmost twice as much sweet porridge.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance
p199
aVby giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
p200
aVThey did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business,
p201
aVlike wasting less energy and water
p202
aVin their manufacturing processes;
p203
aVlike making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized
p204
aVfor the long-term results of the company and the communities they served,
p205
aVnot just quarterly results;
p206
aVor building a first class culture
p207
aVthat would have higher employee loyalty,
p208
aVretention and productivity.
p209
aVNow, Harvard's not alone.
p210
aVOxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies
p211
aVlooking at the effect of sustainability and economic results,
p212
aVand they found time and time and time again
p213
aVthat the companies that cared about these kinds of important things
p214
aVactually had better operational efficiency,
p215
aVlower cost of capital
p216
aVand better performance in their stock price.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd then there's Al Gore.
p219
aVSo 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House,
p220
aVhe was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments
p221
aVto pay attention to the challenges of climate change.
p222
aVPost-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation,
p223
aVwhere he baked environmental sustainability and other things
p224
aVright into the core investment process.
p225
aVAnd at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views.
p226
aVTen years later, his track record is one more proof point
p227
aVthat sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.
p228
aVFar from making less sweet porridge
p229
aVbecause he added sustainability into the mix,
p230
aVhe actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, sustainable investing,
p233
aVthe good news is it doesn't require a magic spell
p234
aVand it doesn't require some investment secret,
p235
aVand it's not just for the elite.
p236
aVIt is not just about private equity for billionaires.
p237
aVIt's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology
p238
aVor microfinance in emerging markets
p239
aVor artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.
p240
aVIt's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.
p241
aVIt's about mutual funds.
p242
aVIt's about all the things
p243
aVwe already see in the market today.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo here's why I'm convinced
p246
aVthat we collectively have the power
p247
aVto make sustainable investing the new normal.
p248
aa(lp249
VFirst, the proof points are coming out all the time
p250
aVthat sustainable investing done right,
p251
aVpreserving all the same good principles of investing,
p252
aVthe traditional sphere, can pay.
p253
aVIt makes sense.
p254
aa(lp255
VSecondly,
p256
aVthe biggest obstacle standing in our way
p257
aVmay actually just be in our heads.
p258
aVWe just need to let go of that myth
p259
aVthat if you add your values into your investment thinking,
p260
aVthat you get less sweet porridge.
p261
aVAnd once you get rid of the fable,
p262
aVyou can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd third, the future is already here.
p265
aVSustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market
p266
aVand it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry.
p267
aVIn the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.
p268
aVIt now represents one out of every six dollars
p269
aVunder professional management in the United States.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo what are we waiting for?
p272
aVFor me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.
p273
aVShe knew that she wanted a life
p274
aVwhere she would have the freedom to make her own choices
p275
aVand to have her voice heard and write her own story.
p276
aVShe was passionate about that goal
p277
aVand she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle,
p278
aVno big institution stand in her way.
p279
aVShe made it to the States,
p280
aVand she became a teacher,
p281
aVan award-winning author
p282
aVand a mother,
p283
aVand ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.
p284
aVAnd these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable
p285
aVholding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.
p286
aVIt seems almost too prophetic
p287
aVthat her name in Korean means
p288
aV"passionate clarity."
p289
aa(lp290
VPassionate clarity:
p291
aVthat's what I think we need to drive change.
p292
aVPassion about the change we want to see in the world,
p293
aVand clarity that we are able to help chart the course.
p294
aVWe have more opportunity today than ever before
p295
aVto make choices.
p296
aVWe have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo change your perspective.
p299
aVVote with your small change.
p300
aVInvest in the change you want to see in the world.
p301
aVChange the fables
p302
aVand change the markets.
p303
