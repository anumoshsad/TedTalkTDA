VThe future of life, where the unraveling of our biology \u2014
p4
aVand bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.
p5
aVI'm just going to talk \u2014
p6
aVabout where that's likely to carry us.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd you know, I saw all the visions
p9
aVof the first couple of sessions.
p10
aVIt almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk
p11
aVabout the future.
p12
aVIt felt wrong to do that in some way.
p13
aVAnd yet, I don't really think it is
p14
aVbecause when it comes down to it,
p15
aVit's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain \u2014
p16
aVwhat people in the future are going to remember about this period.
p17
aa(lp18
VI want to talk to you a little bit about
p19
aVwhy the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,
p20
aVwho would like to ban these sorts of technologies,
p21
aVor of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,
p22
aVare actually \u2014 to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.
p23
aVI'm focusing on biology,
p24
aVthe biological sciences.
p25
aVThe reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be
p26
aVthe areas that are the most significant to us.
p27
aVThe reason for that is really very simple.
p28
aVIt's because we're flesh and blood.
p29
aVWe're biological creatures.
p30
aVAnd what we can do with our biology
p31
aVis going to shape our future
p32
aVand that of our children and that of their children \u2014
p33
aVwhether we gain control over aging,
p34
aVwhether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,
p35
aVand heart disease, and cancer.
p36
aa(lp37
VI think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely.
p38
aVAnd I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVHe said, "And so from hour to hour
p41
aVwe ripe and ripe.
p42
aVAnd then from hour to hour we rot and rot.
p43
aVAnd thereby hangs a tale."
p44
aVLife is short, you know.
p45
aVAnd we need to think about planning a little bit.
p46
aVWe're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,
p47
aVgoing to have to lose everything that we love.
p48
aVWhen you're beginning to rot a little bit,
p49
aVall of the videos crammed into your head,
p50
aVall of the extensions that extend your various powers,
p51
aVare going to being to seem a little secondary.
p52
aVAnd you know, I'm getting a little bit gray \u2014 so is Ray Kurzweil,
p53
aVso is Eric Drexler.
p54
aa(lp55
VThis is where it's really central to our lives.
p56
aVNow I know there's been a whole lot of hype
p57
aVabout our power to control biology.
p58
aVYou just have to look at the Human Genome Project.
p59
aVIt wasn't two years ago
p60
aVthat everybody was talking about \u2014
p61
aVwe've found the Holy Grail of biology.
p62
aVWe're deciphering the code of codes.
p63
aVWe're reading the book of life.
p64
aVIt's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,
p65
aVand everybody was about to race out toward the stars.
p66
aVAnd we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."
p67
aVYou know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.
p68
aVAnd there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.
p69
aVAnd we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.
p70
aVSo it's not surprising that some people would wonder
p71
aVwhether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,
p72
aVwe'll look back at this instant in time,
p73
aVand all of the sort of talk about
p74
aVthe Human Genome Project,
p75
aVand what all this is going to mean to us \u2014
p76
aVwell, it will really mean precious little.
p77
aVAnd I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.
p78
aVBecause when we talk about our genetics and our biology,
p79
aVand modifying and altering and adjusting these things,
p80
aVwe're talking about changing ourselves.
p81
aVAnd this is very critical stuff.
p82
aa(lp83
VIf you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,
p84
aVyou just have to go to any major city.
p85
aVThis is not the stomping ground
p86
aVof our Pleistocene ancestors.
p87
aVWhat's happening is we're taking this technology \u2014
p88
aVit's becoming more precise, more potent \u2014
p89
aVand we're turning it back upon ourselves.
p90
aVBefore it's all done
p91
aVwe are going to alter ourselves
p92
aVevery bit as much as we have changed the world around us.
p93
aVIt's going to happen a lot sooner
p94
aVthan people imagine.
p95
aVOn the way there it's going to
p96
aVcompletely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.
p97
aVIt's going to change the way we have children.
p98
aVIt's going to change the way we manage
p99
aVand alter our emotions.
p100
aVIt's going to probably change the human lifespan.
p101
aVIt will really make us question
p102
aVwhat it is to be a human being.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe larger context of this is that are
p105
aVtwo unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.
p106
aVThe first of them is the obvious one,
p107
aVthe silicon revolution,
p108
aVwhich you all are very, very familiar with.
p109
aVIt's changing our lives in so many ways,
p110
aVand it will continue to do that.
p111
aVWhat the essence of that is, is that we're taking
p112
aVthe sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,
p113
aVand we're breathing a level of complexity into it
p114
aVthat rivals that of life itself,
p115
aVand may even surpass it.
p116
aVAs an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,
p117
aVis the revolution in biology.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe genomics revolution,
p120
aVproteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics"
p121
aVthat sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.
p122
aVWhat we're doing is we are
p123
aVseizing control of our evolutionary future.
p124
aVI mean we're essentially using technology
p125
aVto just jam evolution into fast-forward.
p126
aVIt's not at all clear where it's going to take us.
p127
aVBut in five to ten years we're going to start see
p128
aVsome very profound changes.
p129
aVThe most immediate changes that we'll see
p130
aVare things like in medicine.
p131
aVThere is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine
p132
aVas we start to be able to identify
p133
aVall of the risk factors that we have as individuals.
p134
aVBut who is going to pay for all this?
p135
aVAnd how are we going to understand all this complex information?
p136
aVThat is going to be the IT challenge
p137
aVof the next generation, is communicating all this information.
p138
aa(lp139
VThere's pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology
p140
aVand genetics:
p141
aVtailoring drugs to our individual constitutions
p142
aVthat Juan talked about a little bit earlier.
p143
aVThat's going to have amazing impacts.
p144
aVAnd it's going to be used for diet as well,
p145
aVand nutritional supplements and such.
p146
aVBut it's going to have a big impact because
p147
aVwe're going to have niche drugs.
p148
aVAnd we aren't going to be able to support
p149
aVthe kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.
p150
aVThe approval process is going to fall apart, actually.
p151
aVIt's too slow.
p152
aVIt's too risk-averse.
p153
aVAnd it is really not suited for the future
p154
aVthat we're moving into.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnother thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.
p157
aVIt's really wonderful when we hear,
p158
aV"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.
p159
aVWe're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?"
p160
aVAnd look around you and know
p161
aVthat what we really care about is
p162
aVthat little bit of difference.
p163
aVWe look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,
p164
aVbut not to each other
p165
aVbecause we compete with each other all time.
p166
aVAnd we're going to have to come to grips with the fact
p167
aVthat there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,
p168
aVand between subpopulations of humans as well.
p169
aVTo deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that.
p170
aa(lp171
VA generation or so away
p172
aVthere are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.
p173
aVThat's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.
p174
aVNow I don't mean extra gills or something \u2014
p175
aVsomething we care about, like aging.
p176
aVWhat if we could unravel aging and understand it \u2014
p177
aVbegin to retard the process or even reverse it?
p178
aVIt would change absolutely everything.
p179
aVAnd it's obvious to anyone,
p180
aVthat if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,
p181
aVwhatever the consequences are.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe second is modifying our emotions.
p184
aVI mean Ritalin, Viagra,
p185
aVthings of that sort, Prozac.
p186
aVYou know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.
p187
aVWhat if you could take a little
p188
aVconcoction of pharmaceuticals
p189
aVthat would make you feel really contented,
p190
aVjust happy to be you.
p191
aVAre you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?
p192
aVProbably not.
p193
aVAnd if you don't, who are you going to be?
p194
aVWhy do you do what you do?
p195
aVWe're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.
p196
aVIt's going to be very challenging to deal with.
p197
aa(lp198
VThe third area is reproduction.
p199
aVThe idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,
p200
aVas we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.
p201
aVThat's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,"
p202
aVwhere I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,
p203
aVand the challenges it's going to present to society.
p204
aVThere are three obvious ways of doing this.
p205
aVThe first is cloning.
p206
aVIt didn't happen.
p207
aVIt's a total media circus.
p208
aVIt will happen in five to 10 years.
p209
aVAnd when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.
p210
aVThe birth of a delayed identical twin
p211
aVis not going to shake western civilization.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut there are more important things that are already occurring:
p214
aVembryo screening.
p215
aVYou take a six to eight cell embryo,
p216
aVyou tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,
p217
aVand depending on the results of that test
p218
aVyou either implant that embryo or you discard it.
p219
aVIt's already done to avoid rare diseases today.
p220
aVAnd pretty soon it's going to be possible
p221
aVto avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.
p222
aVAs that becomes possible
p223
aVthis is going to move from something that is used by those who
p224
aVhave infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,
p225
aVto the wealthy who want to protect their children,
p226
aVto just about everybody else.
p227
aVAnd in that process that's going to morph
p228
aVfrom being just for diseases,
p229
aVto being for lesser vulnerabilities,
p230
aVlike risk of manic depression or something,
p231
aVto picking personalities,
p232
aVtemperaments, traits, these sorts of things.
p233
aVOf course there is going to be genetic engineering.
p234
aVDirectly going in \u2014 it's a little bit further away, but not that far away \u2014
p235
aVgoing in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.
p236
aVThe way I suspect it will happen
p237
aVis using artificial chromosomes
p238
aVand extra chromosomes, so we go from 46
p239
aVto 47 or 48.
p240
aVAnd one that is not heritable
p241
aVbecause who would want to pass on to their children
p242
aVthe archaic enhancement modules
p243
aVthat they got 25 years earlier from their parents?
p244
aVIt's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.
p245
aVThey'll want the new release.
p246
aa(lp247
VThose kinds of loose analogies with
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVcomputers, and with programming,
p250
aVare actually much deeper than that.
p251
aVThey are really going to come to operate in this realm.
p252
aVNow not everything that can be done should be done.
p253
aVAnd it won't be done.
p254
aVBut when something is feasible in thousands of
p255
aVlaboratories all over the world,
p256
aVwhich is going to be the case with these technologies,
p257
aVwhen there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,
p258
aVwhich is already the case,
p259
aVand when they're almost impossible to police,
p260
aVit's not a question of if this is going to happen,
p261
aVit's when and where and how it's going to happen.
p262
aa(lp263
VHumanity is going to go down this path.
p264
aVAnd it's going to do so for two reasons.
p265
aVThe first is that all these technologies
p266
aVare just a spin-off of mainstream medical research
p267
aVthat everybody wants to see happen.
p268
aVIt is being funded very very \u2014
p269
aVin a big way.
p270
aVThe second is, we're human.
p271
aVThat's what we do.
p272
aVWe try and use our technology to
p273
aVimprove our lives in one way or another.
p274
aVTo imagine that we're not going to use these technologies
p275
aVwhen they become available,
p276
aVis as much a denial of who we are
p277
aVas to imagine
p278
aVthat we'll use these technologies and not fret
p279
aVand worry about it a great deal.
p280
aVThe lines are going to blur. And they already are
p281
aVbetween therapy and enhancement,
p282
aVbetween treatment and prevention,
p283
aVbetween need and desire.
p284
aVThat's really the central one, I believe.
p285
aa(lp286
VPeople can try and ban these things.
p287
aVThey undoubtedly will. They have.
p288
aVBut ultimately all this is going to do
p289
aVis just shift development elsewhere.
p290
aVIt's going to drive these things from view.
p291
aVIt's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy
p292
aVbecause they are in the best position
p293
aVto circumvent any of these sorts of laws.
p294
aVAnd it's going to deny us
p295
aVthe information that we need to make wise decisions
p296
aVabout how to use these technologies.
p297
aVSo, sure, we need to debate these things.
p298
aVAnd I think it's wonderful that we do.
p299
aVBut we shouldn't kid ourselves
p300
aVand think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.
p301
aVThat is simply not going to happen.
p302
aVThey touch us too deeply.
p303
aVAnd they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,
p304
aVupon religion, upon culture, upon politics.
p305
aVSome people are going to see this
p306
aVas an abomination,
p307
aVas the worst thing, as just awful.
p308
aVOther people are going to say, "This is great.
p309
aVThis is the flowering of human endeavor."
p310
aa(lp311
VThe one thing though that is really dangerous
p312
aVabout these sorts of technologies,
p313
aVis that it's easy to become seduced by them.
p314
aVAnd to focus too much on all
p315
aVthe high-technology possibilities that exist.
p316
aVAnd to lose touch
p317
aVwith the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.
p318
aVThere are too many people that think that high-technology medicine
p319
aVis going to keep them, save them,
p320
aVfrom overeating,
p321
aVfrom eating a lot of fast foods,
p322
aVfrom not getting any exercise.
p323
aVIt's not going to happen.
p324
aa(lp325
VIn the midst of all this amazing technology,
p326
aVand all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting
p327
aVbecause there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:
p328
aVa resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,
p329
aVin nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things
p330
aVthat some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,
p331
aVlike to brand as non-science.
p332
aVBut this whole effort is generated,
p333
aVis driven, by IT as well
p334
aVbecause that is how we're gathering all this information,
p335
aVand linking it, and integrating it together.
p336
aVThere is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.
p337
aVAnd that's where about half of our drugs come.
p338
aVSo we shouldn't dismiss this
p339
aVbecause it's an enormous opportunity to use
p340
aVthese sorts of results,
p341
aVor these random loose trials from the last thousand years
p342
aVabout what has impacts on our health.
p343
aVAnd to use our advanced technologies
p344
aVto pull out what is beneficial from this
p345
aVsea of noise, basically.
p346
aa(lp347
VIn fact this isn't just abstract.
p348
aVI just formed a biotechnology company
p349
aVthat is using
p350
aVthis sort of an approach to develop
p351
aVtherapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,
p352
aVand we're making some real progress.
p353
aVSo here we are.
p354
aVIt's the beginning of a new millennium.
p355
aVIf you look forward,
p356
aVI mean future humans,
p357
aVfar before the end of this millennium,
p358
aVin a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.
p359
aVAnd from the beginning of today's sessions
p360
aVyou'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible
p361
aVdifficult, painful period
p362
aVthat we struggled through.
p363
aVAnd I don't think that's what's going to happen.
p364
aVThey're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.
p365
aVAnd they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.
p366
aVThey are going to think about it
p367
aVas this glorious instant
p368
aVwhen we laid down
p369
aVthe very foundations of their lives,
p370
aVof their society, of their future.
p371
aVYou know it's a little bit like a birth.
p372
aVWhere there is this bloody, awful mess happens.
p373
aVAnd then what comes out of it? New life.
p374
aVActually as was pointed out earlier,
p375
aVwe forget about all the struggle there was in getting there.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo to me,
p378
aVit's clear that one of the foundations of that future
p379
aVis going to be the reworking of our biology.
p380
aVIt's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.
p381
aVWe're going to make lots of errors.
p382
aVThat's the way these things work.
p383
aVTo me it's an incredible privilege
p384
aVto be alive now
p385
aVand to be able to witness this thing.
p386
aVIt is something that is a unique instant
p387
aVin the history of all of life.
p388
aVIt will always be remembered.
p389
aVAnd what's extraordinary is that
p390
aVwe're not just observing this,
p391
aVwe are the architects of this.
p392
aVI think that we should be proud of it.
p393
aVWhat is so difficult and challenging
p394
aVis that we are also the objects of these changes.
p395
aVIt's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.
p396
aVAnd that is why they are so very troubling to so many people
p397
aVwho would pull back in fear.
p398
aVI think that our choice
p399
aVin the choice of life,
p400
aVis not whether we're going to go down this path.
p401
aVWe are, definitely.
p402
aVIt's how we hold it in our hearts.
p403
aVIt's how we look at it.
p404
aVI think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly
p405
aVin 430 B.C. He put it nicely.
p406
aVAgain, I'll use the words in the same order he did.
p407
aV"The bravest are surely those
p408
aVwho have the clearest vision of what is before them,
p409
aVboth glory and danger alike.
p410
aVAnd yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it."
