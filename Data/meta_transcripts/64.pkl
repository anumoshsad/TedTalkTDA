VI bet you're worried.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VI was worried.
p8
aVThat's why I began this piece.
p9
aVI was worried about vaginas.
p10
aVI was worried what we think about vaginas
p11
aVand even more worried that we don't think about them.
p12
aVI was worried about my own vagina.
p13
aVIt needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.
p14
aVThere is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.
p15
aVLike the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VIn the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.
p20
aVWomen go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.
p21
aVI interviewed a high-powered businesswoman;
p22
aVshe told me she didn't have time.
p23
aV"Looking at your vagina," she said, "is a full day's work."
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
V"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror,
p28
aVfull-length preferred.
p29
aVYou've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light,
p30
aVwhich then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at.
p31
aVYou're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting."
p32
aVShe was busy; she didn't have time.
p33
aVSo I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.
p34
aVThey began as casual vagina interviews,
p35
aVand they turned into vagina monologues.
p36
aVI talked with over 200 women.
p37
aVI talked to older women, younger women,
p38
aVmarried women, lesbians, single women.
p39
aVI talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers.
p40
aVI talked to African-American women, Asian-American women,
p41
aVNative-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.
p42
aa(lp43
VOK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk.
p44
aVOnce they got going, you couldn't stop them.
p45
aVWomen love to talk about their vaginas, they do.
p46
aVMainly because no one's ever asked them before.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VLet's just start with the word "vagina" \u2014 vagina, vagina.
p51
aVIt sounds like an infection, at best.
p52
aVMaybe a medical instrument.
p53
aV"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VVagina, vagina, vagina.
p58
aa(lp59
VIt doesn't matter how many times you say the word,
p60
aVit never sounds like a word you want to say.
p61
aVIt's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
p62
aVIf you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct,
p63
aV"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"
p64
aVyou kill the act right there.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VI'm worried what we call them and don't call them.
p69
aVIn Great Neck, New York, they call it a Pussycat.
p70
aVA woman told me there her mother used to tell her,
p71
aV"Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.
p72
aVYou need to air out your Pussycat."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VIn Westchester, they call it a Pooki,
p77
aVin New Jersey, a twat.
p78
aVThere's Powderbox, derriere, a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,
p79
aVa Poopelu, a Pooninana, a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VThere's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi, Dignity, Coochi Snorcher,
p84
aVCooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,
p85
aVWee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,
p86
aVMongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox, a Mimi in Miami,
p87
aVa Split Knish in Philadelphia ...
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
Vand a Schmende in the Bronx.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI am worried about vaginas.
p96
aVThis is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.
p97
aVBut it really didn't begin there.
p98
aVIt began with a conversation with a woman.
p99
aVWe were having a conversation about menopause,
p100
aVand we got onto the subject of her vagina,
p101
aVwhich you'll do if you're talking about menopause.
p102
aVAnd she said things that really shocked me about her vagina \u2014
p103
aVthat it was dried-up and finished and dead \u2014
p104
aVand I was kind of shocked.
p105
aVSo I said to a friend casually,
p106
aV"Well, what do you think about your vagina?"
p107
aVAnd that woman said something more amazing,
p108
aVand then the next woman said something more amazing,
p109
aVand before I knew it, every woman was telling me
p110
aVI had to talk to somebody about their vagina
p111
aVbecause they had an amazing story,
p112
aVand I was sucked down the vagina trail.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd I really haven't gotten off of it.
p117
aVI think if you had told me when I was younger
p118
aVthat I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores,
p119
aVand people would scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"
p120
aVI don't know that that would have been my life ambition.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VBut I want to talk a little bit about happiness,
p125
aVand the relationship to this whole vagina journey,
p126
aVbecause it has been an extraordinary journey
p127
aVthat began eight years ago.
p128
aVI think before I did the "Vagina Monologues,"
p129
aVI didn't really believe in happiness.
p130
aVI thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest.
p131
aVI remember when I started practicing Buddhism 14 years ago,
p132
aVand I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy,
p133
aVI said, "How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering
p134
aVand live in this world of pain?"
p135
aVI mistook happiness for a lot of other things,
p136
aVlike numbness or decadence or selfishness.
p137
aVAnd what happened through the course of the "Vagina Monologues"
p138
aVand this journey is, I think I have come to understand
p139
aVa little bit more about happiness.
p140
aa(lp141
VThere are three qualities I want to talk about.
p142
aVOne is seeing what's right in front of you,
p143
aVand talking about it, and stating it.
p144
aVI think what I learned from talking about the vagina
p145
aVand speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing \u2014
p146
aVit was right in the center of my body and the center of the world \u2014
p147
aVand yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
p148
aVThe second thing is that what talking about the vagina did
p149
aVis it opened this door which allowed me to see
p150
aVthat there was a way to serve the world to make it better.
p151
aVAnd that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from.
p152
aVAnd the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently:
p153
aa(lp154
VEight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this "V-wave" started \u2014
p155
aVand I can only describe it as a "V-wave" because, to be honest,
p156
aVI really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it.
p157
aVBut this wave started, and if I question the wave,
p158
aVor try to stop the wave or look back at the wave,
p159
aVI often have the experience of whiplash
p160
aVor the potential of my neck breaking.
p161
aVBut if I go with the wave,
p162
aVand I trust the wave and I move with the wave,
p163
aVI go to the next place, and it happens logically and organically and truthfully.
p164
aVAnd I started this piece, particularly with stories and narratives,
p165
aVand I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman
p166
aVand that led to another woman.
p167
aVAnd then I wrote those stories down,
p168
aVand I put them out in front of other people.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd every single time I did the show at the beginning,
p171
aVwomen would literally line up after the show,
p172
aVbecause they wanted to tell me their stories.
p173
aVAnd at first I thought, "Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms,
p174
aVand great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas."
p175
aVBut in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me.
p176
aVWhat women lined up to tell me was how they were raped,
p177
aVand how they were battered, and how they were beaten,
p178
aVand how they were gang-raped in parking lots,
p179
aVand how they were incested by their uncles.
p180
aVAnd I wanted to stop doing the "Vagina Monologues,"
p181
aVbecause it felt too daunting.
p182
aVI felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events,
p183
aVbut doesn't intervene on their behalf.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd so in 1997, I said, "Let's get women together.
p186
aVWhat could we do with this information
p187
aVthat all these women are being violated?"
p188
aVAnd it turned out, after thinking and investigating,
p189
aVthat I discovered \u2014 and the UN has actually said this recently \u2014
p190
aVthat one out of every three women on this planet
p191
aVwill be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
p192
aVThat's essentially a gender;
p193
aVthat's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women.
p194
aVSo in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said,
p195
aV"How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?"
p196
aVAnd we put on one event in New York City, in the theater,
p197
aVand all these great actors came \u2014 from Susan Sarandon,
p198
aVto Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg \u2014
p199
aVand we did one performance on one evening,
p200
aVand that catalyzed this wave, this energy.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd within five years,
p203
aVthis extraordinary thing began to happen.
p204
aVOne woman took that energy and she said, "I want to bring this wave,
p205
aVthis energy, to college campuses,"
p206
aVand so she took the play and she said,
p207
aV"Let's use the play and have performances once a year,
p208
aVwhere we can raise money to stop violence against women
p209
aVin local communities all around the world."
p210
aVAnd in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.
p211
aVAnd over the course of the last six years,
p212
aVit's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhat I have learned is two things:
p215
aVone, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global;
p216
aVit is so profound and it is so devastating,
p217
aVand it is so in every little pocket of every little crater,
p218
aVof every little society that we don't even recognize it,
p219
aVbecause it's become ordinary.
p220
aVThis journey has taken me to Afghanistan,
p221
aVwhere I had the extraordinary honor and privilege
p222
aVto go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban.
p223
aVI was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group,
p224
aVcalled the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.
p225
aVAnd I saw firsthand how women had been stripped
p226
aVof every single right that was possible to strip women of \u2014
p227
aVfrom being educated, to being employed,
p228
aVto being actually allowed to eat ice cream.
p229
aVFor those of you who don't know,
p230
aVit was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban.
p231
aVAnd I actually saw and met women who had been flogged
p232
aVfor being caught eating vanilla ice cream.
p233
aVI was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town,
p234
aVwhere we went to a back room, and women were seated
p235
aVand a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream.
p236
aVAnd women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream.
p237
aVAnd I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment,
p238
aVand how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.
p239
aa(lp240
VIt has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad,
p241
aVwhere I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
p242
aVIt has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago,
p243
aVwhere I have literally been there in parking lots,
p244
aVwhere bones of women have washed up
p245
aVand been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
p246
aVIt has taken me to universities all over this country,
p247
aVwhere girls are date-raped and drugged.
p248
aVI have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.
p249
aVBut I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence,
p250
aVthat being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us
p251
aVis the antidote to depression,
p252
aVand to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value.
p253
aa(lp254
VBecause before the "Vagina Monologues,"
p255
aVI will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off
p256
aVto what was really going on in this reality,
p257
aVand that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy.
p258
aVWhat has also happened is in the course of these travels \u2014
p259
aVand it's been an extraordinary thing \u2014
p260
aVis that every single place that I have gone to in the world,
p261
aVI have met a new species.
p262
aVAnd I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea.
p263
aVAnd I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people
p264
aVon this particular panel,
p265
aVthat it's beneath, beyond and between,
p266
aVand the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VBut one of the things I've seen is this species \u2014
p271
aVand it is a species, and it is a new paradigm,
p272
aVand it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media
p273
aVbecause I don't think good news ever is news,
p274
aVand I don't think people who are transforming the planet
p275
aVare what gets the ratings on TV shows.
p276
aVBut every single country I have been to \u2014
p277
aVand in the last six years, I've been to about 45 countries,
p278
aVand many tiny little villages and cities and towns \u2014
p279
aVI have seen something what I've come to call "vagina warriors."
p280
aVA "vagina warrior" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man,
p281
aVwho has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it,
p282
aVand rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction
p283
aVor a machete,
p284
aVthey hold the violence in their bodies;
p285
aVthey grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out
p286
aVand devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.
p287
aa(lp288
VI have met these women everywhere on the planet,
p289
aVand I want to tell a few stories,
p290
aVbecause I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information,
p291
aVwhere it goes into our bodies.
p292
aVAnd I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting
p293
aVis that I live in my body a lot,
p294
aVand I don't live in my head very much anymore.
p295
aVAnd this is a very heady place.
p296
aVAnd it's been really interesting to be in my head
p297
aVfor the last two days; I've been very disoriented \u2014
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
Vbecause I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.
p302
aVIt's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.
p303
aVAnd I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads,
p304
aVthat that separation has created a divide
p305
aVthat is often separating purpose from intent.
p306
aVAnd the connection between body and head
p307
aVoften brings those things into union.
p308
aa(lp309
VI want to talk about three particular people that I've met,
p310
aVvagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding
p311
aVof this whole principle and species,
p312
aVand one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
p313
aVMarsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.
p314
aVShe was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage
p315
aVand her husband was beating her on a regular basis.
p316
aVAnd she couldn't get out,
p317
aVbecause she was addicted to the relationship,
p318
aVand she had no money.
p319
aVHer sister was younger than her, and she applied \u2014
p320
aVwe had a "Stop Rape" contest a few years ago in New York \u2014
p321
aVand she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist
p322
aVand she could bring her sister.
p323
aVShe did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd at that time,
p326
aVwe did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden,
p327
aVwhere we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome \u2014
p328
aV18,000 people standing up to say "Yes" to vaginas,
p329
aVwhich was really a pretty incredible transformation.
p330
aVAnd she came, and she witnessed this,
p331
aVand she decided that she would go back and leave her husband,
p332
aVand that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.
p333
aVShe was 21 years old.
p334
aVI went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala.
p335
aVAnd I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels,
p336
aVand she stood there and said, "My name is Marsha.
p337
aVI was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me.
p338
aVI left and you can, too."
p339
aVAnd the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy.
p340
aa(lp341
VThere's a woman named Esther Chávez who I met in Juarez, Mexico.
p342
aVAnd Esther Chávez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.
p343
aVShe was 72 years old and she was planning to retire.
p344
aVShe went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt,
p345
aVand in the course of it, she began to discover what was happening
p346
aVto the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez.
p347
aVShe gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.
p348
aVShe started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.
p349
aV300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.
p350
aVThere has been no response to the disappearance,
p351
aVand not one person has been held accountable.
p352
aVShe began to document it.
p353
aVShe opened a center called Casa Amiga, and in six years,
p354
aVshe has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.
p355
aVWe were there a week ago,
p356
aVwhen there were 7,000 people in the street, and it was truly a miracle.
p357
aVAnd as we walked through the streets,
p358
aVthe people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets,
p359
aVbecause the streets are so dangerous,
p360
aVliterally stood there and wept,
p361
aVto see that other people from the world had showed up
p362
aVfor that particular community.
p363
aa(lp364
VThere's another woman, named Agnes.
p365
aVAnd Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.
p366
aVI met her three years ago in Kenya.
p367
aVAnd Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;
p368
aVshe was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old,
p369
aVand she really made a decision
p370
aVthat she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.
p371
aVSo when she got older, she created this incredible thing:
p372
aVit's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body.
p373
aVAnd she walked through the Rift Valley,
p374
aVand she had vagina and vagina replacement parts,
p375
aVwhere she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls
p376
aVwhat a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like.
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd in the course of her travel \u2014
p379
aVshe walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley,
p380
aVthrough dust, through sleeping on the ground,
p381
aVbecause the Maasai are nomads,
p382
aVand she would have to find them, and they would move,
p383
aVand she would find them again \u2014
p384
aVshe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
p385
aa(lp386
VAnd in that time, she created an alternative ritual,
p387
aVwhich involved girls coming of age without the cut.
p388
aVWhen we met her three years ago,
p389
aVwe said, "What could V-Day do for you?"
p390
aVAnd she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster."
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VSo we bought her a jeep.
p395
aVAnd in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
p396
aVSo we said to her, "What else could we do for you?"
p397
aVShe said, "Well, Eve, if you gave me some money,
p398
aVI could open a house and girls could run away,
p399
aVand they could be saved."
p400
aVAnd I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings,
p401
aVbecause it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.
p402
aa(lp403
VWhen I was a little girl \u2014 I grew up in a wealthy community;
p404
aVit was an upper-middle class white community,
p405
aVand it had all the trappings and the looks
p406
aVof a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life.
p407
aVAnd everyone was supposed to be happy in that community,
p408
aVand, in fact, my life was hell.
p409
aVI lived with an alcoholic father
p410
aVwho beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that.
p411
aVAnd always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me.
p412
aVAnd I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator.
p413
aVI would call him up when things got really bad,
p414
aVand say it was time to come and pick me up.
p415
aVAnd I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.
p416
aa(lp417
VNow, Mr. Alligator never did come,
p418
aVbut the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity
p419
aVand made it OK for me to keep going,
p420
aVbecause I believed, in the distance,
p421
aVthere would be someone coming to rescue me.
p422
aa(lp423
VCut to 40-some odd years later,
p424
aVwe go to Kenya, and we're walking,
p425
aVwe arrive at the opening of this house.
p426
aVAnd Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days,
p427
aVbecause they were preparing this whole ritual.
p428
aa(lp429
VI want to tell you a great story.
p430
aVWhen Agnes first started fighting
p431
aVto stop female genital mutilation in her community,
p432
aVshe had become an outcast, and she was exiled and slandered,
p433
aVand the whole community turned against her.
p434
aVBut being a vagina warrior, she kept going,
p435
aVand she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness.
p436
aVAnd in the Maasai community,
p437
aVgoats and cows are the most valued possession.
p438
aVThey're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley.
p439
aVAnd she said two days before the house opened,
p440
aVtwo different people arrived to give her a goat each,
p441
aVand she said to me,
p442
aV"I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa."
p443
aa(lp444
VAnyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,
p445
aVthere were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses \u2014
p446
aVwhich is the color of the Maasai and the color of V-Day \u2014
p447
aVand they greeted us.
p448
aVThey had made up these songs that they were singing,
p449
aVabout the end of suffering and the end of mutilation,
p450
aVand they walked us down the path.
p451
aVIt was a gorgeous day in the African sun,
p452
aVand the dust was flying and the girls were dancing,
p453
aVand there was this house, and it said, "V-Day Safe House for the Girls."
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years,
p456
aVbut that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.
p457
aVAnd he had shown up, obviously,
p458
aVin a form that it took me a long time to understand,
p459
aVwhich is that when we give in the world what we want the most,
p460
aVwe heal the broken part inside each of us.
p461
aa(lp462
VAnd I feel, in the last eight years,
p463
aVthat this journey \u2014 this miraculous vagina journey \u2014
p464
aVhas taught me this really simple thing,
p465
aVwhich is that happiness exists in action;
p466
aVit exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is;
p467
aVand it exists in giving away what you want the most.
p468
aVAnd I feel that knowledge and that journey
p469
aVhas been an extraordinary privilege,
p470
aVand I feel really blessed
p471
aVto have been here today to communicate that to you.
p472
aa(lp473
VThank you very much.
