VA fact
p4
aVcame out of MIT,
p5
aVcouple of years ago. Ken Hale,
p6
aVwho's a linguist,
p7
aVsaid that of the 6,000 languages
p8
aVspoken on Earth right now,
p9
aV3,000 aren't spoken by the children.
p10
aVSo that in one generation,
p11
aVwe're going to halve our cultural diversity.
p12
aVHe went on to say
p13
aVthat every two weeks,
p14
aVan elder goes to the grave
p15
aVcarrying the last spoken word
p16
aVof that culture.
p17
aVSo an entire philosophy,
p18
aVa body of knowledge about the natural world
p19
aVthat had been empirically gleaned over centuries,
p20
aVgoes away.
p21
aVAnd this happens every two weeks.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo for the last 20 years,
p24
aVsince my dental experience,
p25
aVI have been traveling the world
p26
aVand coming back
p27
aVwith stories about some of these people.
p28
aVWhat I'd like to do right now
p29
aVis share some of those stories with you.
p30
aVThis is Tamdin.
p31
aVShe is a 69-year-old nun.
p32
aVShe was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years
p33
aVfor putting up a little tiny placard
p34
aVprotesting the occupation of her country.
p35
aVAnd when I met her, she had just
p36
aVtaken a walk over the Himalayas
p37
aVfrom Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,
p38
aVinto Nepal, across to India \u2014
p39
aV30 days \u2014
p40
aVto meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.
p41
aVThe Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.
p42
aVSo I took this picture three days
p43
aVafter she arrived,
p44
aVand she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,
p45
aVwith her toes sticking out.
p46
aVAnd she crossed in March,
p47
aVand there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.
p48
aa(lp49
VThis is Paldin.
p50
aVPaldin is a 62-year-old monk.
p51
aVAnd he spent 33 years in prison.
p52
aVHis whole monastery was thrown into prison
p53
aVat the time of the uprising,
p54
aVwhen the Dalai Lama had to leave
p55
aVTibet.
p56
aVAnd
p57
aVhe was beaten, starved,
p58
aVtortured \u2014 lost all his teeth while in prison.
p59
aVAnd when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.
p60
aVAnd it really impressed me \u2014
p61
aVI met him two weeks after he got out of prison \u2014
p62
aVthat he went through that experience, and ended up
p63
aVwith the demeanor that he had.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,
p66
aVand I'd spent about five weeks there,
p67
aVand I was hearing these similar stories
p68
aVof these refugees that had poured out of Tibet
p69
aVinto Dharamsala.
p70
aVAnd it just so happened, on the fifth week,
p71
aVthere was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.
p72
aVAnd
p73
aVI was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,
p74
aVmany of which I had just interviewed,
p75
aVand heard their stories,
p76
aVand I watched their faces,
p77
aVand they gave us a little FM radio,
p78
aVand we could listen to the translation of his teachings.
p79
aVAnd what he said was:
p80
aVtreat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,
p81
aVbecause it's your enemies
p82
aVthat build your tolerance and patience
p83
aVon the road to your enlightenment.
p84
aVThat hit me so hard,
p85
aVtelling these people that had been through this experience.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo, two months later, I went into
p88
aVTibet, and I started
p89
aVinterviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.
p90
aVI interview and do portraits.
p91
aVAnd this is a little girl.
p92
aVI took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.
p93
aVAnd I'd snuck in \u2014
p94
aVbecause it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet \u2014
p95
aVit's the quickest way you can get arrested.
p96
aVSo I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,
p97
aVand I would hand them out.
p98
aVAnd when I gave them to the people,
p99
aVthey'd either hold them to their heart,
p100
aVor they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.
p101
aVAnd this is \u2014
p102
aVwell, at the time \u2014 I did this 10 years ago \u2014
p103
aVthat was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo
p106
aVI was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.
p107
aVThis is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.
p108
aVAnd they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,
p109
aVway in the western part of the country.
p110
aVThis is at 17,000 feet.
p111
aVAnd they had just come down from the high pastures,
p112
aVat 18,000 feet.
p113
aVSame thing: gave her a picture,
p114
aVshe held it up to her forehead.
p115
aVAnd I usually hand out Polaroids
p116
aVwhen I do these, because I'm setting up lights,
p117
aVand checking my lights,
p118
aVand when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis is Tenzin Gyatso;
p121
aVhe was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,
p122
aVout in a peasant's house,
p123
aVway out in the middle of nowhere.
p124
aVAt the age of four, he was installed
p125
aVas the 14th Dalai Lama.
p126
aVAs a teenager, he faced
p127
aVthe invasion of his country,
p128
aVand had to deal with it \u2014 he was the leader of the country.
p129
aVEight years later, when they discovered there was a plot
p130
aVto kill him,
p131
aVthey dressed him up like a beggar
p132
aVand snuck him out of the country on horseback,
p133
aVand took the same trip that Tamdin did.
p134
aVAnd he's never been back to his country since.
p135
aVAnd
p136
aVif you think about this man,
p137
aV46 years later,
p138
aVstill sticking
p139
aVto this non-violent response
p140
aVto a severe political and human rights issue.
p141
aVAnd the young people,
p142
aVyoung Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.
p143
aVYou know, violence as a political tool
p144
aVis all the rage right now.
p145
aVAnd
p146
aVhe still is holding this line.
p147
aVSo this is our icon
p148
aVto non-violence in our world \u2014
p149
aVone of our living icons.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is another leader of his people.
p152
aVThis is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
p153
aVAnd Moi is 35 years old.
p154
aVAnd
p155
aVthis area of the Ecuadorian Amazon \u2014
p156
aVoil was discovered in 1972.
p157
aVAnd in this period of time \u2014 since that time \u2014
p158
aVas much oil, or twice as much oil
p159
aVas was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,
p160
aVwas spilled in this little area of the Amazon,
p161
aVand the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.
p162
aVAnd Moi
p163
aVbelongs to the Huaorani tribe,
p164
aVand they're known as
p165
aVvery fierce, they're known as "auca."
p166
aVAnd they've managed to keep out
p167
aVthe seismologists and the oil workers
p168
aVwith spears and blowguns.
p169
aVAnd we spent \u2014
p170
aVI was with a team \u2014
p171
aVtwo weeks with these guys out in the jungle
p172
aVwatching them hunt.
p173
aVThis was on a monkey hunt,
p174
aVhunting with curare-tipped darts.
p175
aVAnd the knowledge that these people have
p176
aVabout the natural environment is incredible.
p177
aVThey could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.
p178
aVAnd I couldn't even see the monkeys
p179
aVthat they were
p180
aVgetting with these darts.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis is Yadira,
p183
aVand Yadira is
p184
aVfive years old. She's in a
p185
aVtribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.
p186
aVAnd her tribe has had to move
p187
aVthree times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.
p188
aVAnd we never hear about that. And the latest
p189
aVinfraction against these people is,
p190
aVas part of Plan Colombia,
p191
aVwe're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is \u2014
p192
aVwe're defoliating thousands of acres
p193
aVof the Ecuadorian Amazon
p194
aVin our war on drugs.
p195
aVAnd these people are the people who take the brunt of it.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is Mengatoue.
p198
aVHe's the shaman of the Huaorani,
p199
aVand
p200
aVhe said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;
p201
aVI'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired
p202
aVof spearing these oil workers.
p203
aVI wish they would just go away.
p204
aVAnd I was \u2014 I usually travel alone
p205
aVwhen I do my work, but I did this \u2014
p206
aVI hosted a program for Discovery,
p207
aVand when I went down with the team,
p208
aVI was quite concerned about
p209
aVgoing in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,
p210
aVdeep into the Huaorani tribe.
p211
aVAnd
p212
aVas it turned out, these guys really
p213
aVtaught me a thing or two about blending in
p214
aVwith the locals.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VOne of the things I did
p218
aVjust before 9/11 \u2014
p219
aVAugust of 2001 \u2014
p220
aVI took my son, Dax,
p221
aVwho was 16 at the time,
p222
aVand I took him to Pakistan.
p223
aVBecause at first I wanted \u2014
p224
aVyou know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,
p225
aVbut I wanted him to see
p226
aVpeople that live on a dollar a day or less.
p227
aVI wanted him to get an experience
p228
aVin the Islamic world
p229
aVand I also wanted him to \u2014
p230
aVI was going there to work with a group,
p231
aVdo a story on a group called the Kalash,
p232
aVthat are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,
p233
aVthat live \u2014 very small area \u2014
p234
aVsurrounded by Islam \u2014 there's 3,000
p235
aVof these Kalash left; they're incredible people.
p236
aVSo it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,
p237
aVdrumming and dancing.
p238
aVAnd he brought a soccer ball,
p239
aVand we had soccer every night in this little village.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd then we went up
p242
aVand met their shaman.
p243
aVBy the way, Mengatoue was the shaman
p244
aVof his tribe as well.
p245
aVAnd this is John Doolikahn,
p246
aVwho's the shaman of the Kalash.
p247
aVAnd he's up in the mountains,
p248
aVright on the border with Afghanistan.
p249
aVIn fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,
p250
aVthe area where
p251
aVOsama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.
p252
aVAnd we watched
p253
aVand stayed with
p254
aVJohn Doolikahn.
p255
aVAnd the shaman \u2014 I did a whole series on shamanism,
p256
aVwhich is
p257
aVan interesting phenomenon.
p258
aVBut around the world,
p259
aVthey go into trance in different ways,
p260
aVand in Pakistan,
p261
aVthe way they do it is they burn juniper leaves
p262
aVand they sacrifice an animal,
p263
aVpour the blood of the animal on the leaves
p264
aVand then inhale the smoke.
p265
aVAnd they're all praying
p266
aVto the mountain gods
p267
aVas they go into trance.
p268
aa(lp269
VYou know,
p270
aVgetting kids used to different realities,
p271
aVI think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day \u2014
p272
aVhaving a curriculum where they study different religions,
p273
aVjust to make a mental flexibility,
p274
aVgive them a mental flexibility
p275
aVin different belief systems \u2014
p276
aVI think this is so necessary in our world today
p277
aVas you see these clash of beliefs taking place.
p278
aVAnd all the security issues they cause us.
p279
aVSo, one thing we did five years ago:
p280
aVwe started a program that links kids
p281
aVin indigenous communities with kids in the United States.
p282
aVSo we first hooked up
p283
aVa spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.
p284
aVWe now have 15 sites.
p285
aVWe have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;
p286
aVDharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya \u2014
p287
aVTakaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim
p288
aVand one-third animist, the community is \u2014
p289
aVOllantaytambo, Peru,
p290
aVand Arctic Village, Alaska.
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is Daniel; he's one of our students
p293
aVin Arctic Village, Alaska.
p294
aVHe lives in this log cabin \u2014
p295
aVno running water, no heat other than \u2014
p296
aVno windows
p297
aVand high-speed Internet connection.
p298
aVAnd this is \u2014
p299
aVI see this rolling out all over \u2014
p300
aVthis is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,
p301
aVwhere they first saw their first computers;
p302
aVnow they have computers in their classrooms.
p303
aVAnd the way we've done this \u2014
p304
aVwe teach digital storytelling to these kids.
p305
aVAnd we have them tell stories about issues in their community
p306
aVin their community that they care about.
p307
aVAnd this is in Peru, where the kids told the story
p308
aVabout a river that they cleaned up.
p309
aVAnd the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,
p310
aVand we bring people who want to learn
p311
aVdigital workflow and storytelling,
p312
aVand have them
p313
aVwork with the kids.
p314
aVAnd just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,
p315
aVand this has worked the best.
p316
aVSo our dream is to bring teenagers together,
p317
aVso they'll have a community service experience
p318
aVas well as a cross-cultural experience,
p319
aVas they teach kids in these areas
p320
aVand help them build their communication infrastructure.
p321
aa(lp322
VThis is teaching Photoshop
p323
aVin the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.
p324
aVWe have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.
p325
aVThis is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies
p326
aVthat these kids have made,
p327
aVand they're quite incredible.
p328
aVThe one I want to show you \u2014
p329
aVafter we get them to make the movies,
p330
aVwe have a night where we show the movies to the community.
p331
aVAnd this is in Takaungu \u2014
p332
aVwe've got a generator and a digital projector,
p333
aVand we're projecting it up against a barn,
p334
aVand showing one of the movies that they made.
p335
aVAnd if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see
p336
aVthe incredible work these kids do.
p337
aa(lp338
VThe other thing:
p339
aVI wanted to give indigenous people a voice.
p340
aVThat was one of the big motivating factors.
p341
aVBut the other motivating factor is
p342
aVthe insular nature of our country.
p343
aVNational Geographic just did a Roper Study
p344
aVof 18 to 26 year olds
p345
aVin our country
p346
aVand in nine other industrialized countries.
p347
aVIt was a two million dollar study.
p348
aVUnited States came in second to last
p349
aVin geographic knowledge.
p350
aV70 percent of the kids couldn't find
p351
aVAfghanistan or Iraq on a map;
p352
aV60 percent couldn't find India;
p353
aV30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.
p354
aVAnd this is a study
p355
aVthat was just done a couple of years ago.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo what I'd like to show you now,
p358
aVin the couple of minutes I have left,
p359
aVis a film that a student made in Guatemala.
p360
aVWe just had a workshop in Guatemala.
p361
aVA week before we got to the workshop,
p362
aVa massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,
p363
aVlast October, came in and buried
p364
aV600 people alive in their village.
p365
aVAnd this kid lived in the village \u2014
p366
aVhe wasn't there at the time \u2014
p367
aVand this is the little movie he put together about that.
p368
aVAnd he hadn't seen a computer before
p369
aVwe did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and \u2014
p370
aVyeah, we can play it.
p371
aa(lp372
VThis is an old Mayan funeral chant
p373
aVthat he got from his grandfather.
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you very much.
