VLast year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.
p4
aVAnd I promised to come back and give you an update
p5
aVon how that machine worked.
p6
aVSo this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,
p7
aVthe LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted \u2014
p8
aV27 kilometers in circumference.
p9
aVIts job is to recreate the conditions
p10
aVthat were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,
p11
aVup to 600 million times a second.
p12
aVIt's nothing if not ambitious.
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is the machine below Geneva.
p15
aVWe take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.
p16
aVThis is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector \u2014
p17
aV44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.
p18
aVSpectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction
p19
aVso you can see the scale.
p20
aa(lp21
VOn the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.
p22
aVAnd this picture was taken by ATLAS.
p23
aVIt caused immense celebration in the control room.
p24
aVIt's a picture of the first beam particle
p25
aVgoing all the way around the LHC,
p26
aVcolliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,
p27
aVand showering particles into the detector.
p28
aVIn other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th
p29
aVwe knew the machine worked,
p30
aVwhich is a great triumph.
p31
aVI don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,
p32
aVor this, when someone went onto Google
p33
aVand saw the front page was like that.
p34
aVIt means we made cultural impact
p35
aVas well as scientific impact.
p36
aa(lp37
VAbout a week later we had a problem with the machine,
p38
aVrelated actually to these bits of wire here \u2014 these gold wires.
p39
aVThose wires carry 13 thousand amps
p40
aVwhen the machine is working in full power.
p41
aVNow the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,
p42
aV"No they don't. They're small wires."
p43
aVThey can do that because
p44
aVwhen they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.
p45
aVSo at minus 271 degrees,
p46
aVcolder than the space between the stars,
p47
aVthose wires can take that current.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,
p50
aVthere was a manufacturing defect.
p51
aVSo the wire heated up slightly,
p52
aVand its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
p53
aVThis was the result.
p54
aVNow that's more impressive
p55
aVwhen you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,
p56
aVand they moved about a foot.
p57
aVSo we damaged about 50 of the magnets.
p58
aVWe had to take them out, which we did.
p59
aVWe reconditioned them all, fixed them.
p60
aVThey're all on their way back underground now.
p61
aVBy the end of March the LHC will be intact again.
p62
aVWe will switch it on,
p63
aVand we expect to take data in June or July,
p64
aVand continue with our quest to find out
p65
aVwhat the building blocks of the universe are.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow of course, in a way
p68
aVthose accidents reignite the debate
p69
aVabout the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.
p70
aVI think that the fact that it's so difficult,
p71
aVthe fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
p72
aVI will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,
p73
aVwho, I suspect,
p74
aVwhen defending his protege's useless experiments \u2014
p75
aVhis protege was Michael Faraday \u2014
p76
aVsaid this, "Nothing is so dangerous
p77
aVto the progress of the human mind
p78
aVthan to assume that our views of science are ultimate,
p79
aVthat there are no mysteries in nature,
p80
aVthat our triumphs are complete, and that
p81
aVthere are no new worlds to conquer."
p82
aVThank you.
