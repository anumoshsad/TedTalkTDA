VSo, what I'd like to talk about is something
p4
aVthat was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:
p5
aVhow do we discover what is really particular about a project?
p6
aVHow do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?
p7
aVBecause it seems to me that finding this uniqueness
p8
aVhas to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;
p9
aVthat the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place
p10
aVand the uniqueness of a program in a building.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,
p13
aVwhere I was asked some years ago to do a science museum
p14
aVon a site, right downtown by the river.
p15
aVAnd I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.
p16
aVUnfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard
p17
aVso I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"
p18
aVand that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAnd it took six months to reroute it.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe first image I showed the building committee was
p23
aVthis astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur
p24
aVbecause I talked about what makes a building a building of science.
p25
aVAnd it seemed to me that this structure \u2014 complex, rich and yet
p26
aVtotally rational: it's an instrument \u2014 had something to do with science,
p27
aVand somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.
p28
aVAnd so my first sketch after I left was to say,
p29
aV"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."
p30
aVAnd I got all excited and came back, and
p31
aVthey sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?
p32
aVThis used to be an island \u2014 Ackerman Island \u2014
p33
aVand we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd so the process began and they said,
p37
aV"You can't put it all on an island;
p38
aVsome of it has to be on the mainland because
p39
aVwe don't want to turn our back to the community."
p40
aVAnd there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island
p41
aVand you could walk through them or on the roof.
p42
aVAnd there were all kinds of exciting features:
p43
aVyou could come in through the landside buildings,
p44
aVwalk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.
p45
aVIf you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,
p46
aVpeek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,
p47
aVcome back and pay the five dollars admission.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd the client was happy \u2014 well, sort of happy
p50
aVbecause we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.
p53
aVIt was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.
p54
aVIt was, what I would say, compositional complexity,
p55
aVand I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about \u2014
p56
aVa building for science \u2014 there had to be some kind of a generating idea,
p57
aVsome kind of a generating geometry.
p58
aVAnd this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,
p59
aVone with its center deep in the earth for the landside building
p60
aVand a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.
p61
aVA toroid, for those who don't know,
p62
aVis the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.
p63
aVAnd out of this idea started spinning off many,
p64
aVmany kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,
p65
aVand then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,
p66
aVand you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd finally the building \u2014 this is the model.
p69
aVAnd when there were complaints about budget, I said,
p70
aV"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
p71
aVAnd here's the building as it opened,
p72
aVwith a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
p73
aVAnd the bike route's going right through the building,
p74
aVso those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.
p75
aVThe toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:
p76
aVevery beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.
p77
aVEvery wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.
p78
aVEvery piece of the building works.
p79
aVThese are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,
p80
aVand at night, and on opening day.
p81
aa(lp82
VGoing back to 1976.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVIn 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum
p85
aVin a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,
p86
aVwhich you see here the campus.
p87
aVI was asked to do a building,
p88
aVand I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
p89
aVAnd I felt very troubled.
p90
aVI worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it
p91
aVbecause I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,
p92
aVthey are totally saturated with information
p93
aVand to see yet another museum with information,
p94
aVit would make them just unable to digest.
p95
aVAnd so I made a counter-proposal:
p96
aa(lp97
VI said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,
p98
aVdescend through the rock into an underground chamber.
p99
aVThere's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished
p100
aVand then you come into a large space.
p101
aVThere is a single candle flickering in the center;
p102
aVby an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.
p103
aVYou walk through the space, a voice reads the names,
p104
aVages and place of birth of the children.
p105
aVThis voice does not repeat for six months.
p106
aVAnd then you descend to light and to the north and to life.
p107
aa(lp108
VWell, they said, "People won't understand,
p109
aVthey'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
p110
aVAnd they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,
p111
aVand then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,
p112
aVwho had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,
p113
aVcame, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, many years after that in 1998,
p116
aVI was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem
p117
aVand I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,
p118
aV"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.
p119
aVHe is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,
p120
aVwe took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.
p121
aVHe's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"
p122
aVAnd I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,
p123
aV"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.
p124
aVI was very moved by what I saw today.
p125
aVWe are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;
p126
aVwe're about to embark on that.
p127
aVI'd like you to come and design it."
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.
p130
aVBut two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,
p131
aVoutside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,
p132
aVand the temple and also next to it the fortress
p133
aVthat the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in
p134
aVas he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.
p135
aVAnd I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,
p136
aVnine kilometers away from the town and the temple,
p137
aVand said, "That's where we have chosen the location."
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.
p140
aVThe pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands \u2014
p141
aVthey're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.
p142
aVLet's get back to the town and walk to the site."
p143
aVAnd I recommended they do it right there, on that hill
p144
aVand this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.
p145
aVAnd, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week
p146
aVand we were working.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd my proposal was to split the museum into two \u2014
p150
aVthe permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,
p151
aVand changing exhibitions on the other \u2014
p152
aVto flood the valley into a series of water gardens
p153
aVand to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.
p154
aVAnd the structures rise from the sand cliffs \u2014
p155
aVthey're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel \u2014
p156
aVthey are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,
p157
aVpedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.
p158
aVAnd as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs
p159
aVas you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then I went away for four months
p162
aVand there was going to be groundbreaking.
p163
aVAnd I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind
p164
aVhad been built ten times bigger for public display on site
p165
aVand ... the bridge was built!
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVWithin the working drawings!
p168
aVAnd half a million people gathered for the celebrations;
p169
aVyou can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
p170
aVI was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;
p171
aVthere are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.
p172
aa(lp173
VBack to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,
p174
aVYad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum
p175
aVbecause now Washington was built \u2014 the Holocaust Museum in Washington \u2014
p176
aVand that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.
p177
aVAnd Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.
p178
aVThey said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
p179
aVBut of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter \u2014 the Jews make it hard:
p180
aVinternational competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion
p184
aVthat a building the size of the Washington building \u2014
p185
aV50,000 square feet \u2014 will sit on that fragile hill
p186
aVand that we will go into galleries \u2014 rooms with doors
p187
aVand sort of familiar rooms \u2014 to tell the story of the Holocaust.
p188
aVAnd I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.
p189
aVJust cut the whole museum through the mountain \u2014
p190
aVenter from one side of the mountain,
p191
aVcome out on the other side of the mountain \u2014
p192
aVand then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd here you see the model:
p195
aVa reception building and some underground parking.
p196
aVYou cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,
p197
aVwhich cuts right into the hill
p198
aVand extends right through as you go towards the north.
p199
aVAnd all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,
p200
aVand you see the openings for the light.
p201
aVAnd at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,
p202
aVwhich is a skylight on top of that triangle.
p203
aVAnd all the galleries,
p204
aVas you move through them and so on, are below grade.
p205
aVAnd there are chambers carved in the rock \u2014
p206
aVconcrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible \u2014 with the light shafts.
p207
aVThis is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired
p208
aVthe kind of spaces that these galleries could be.
p209
aVAnd then, coming towards the north, it opens up:
p210
aVit bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city
p211
aVand of the Jerusalem hills.
p212
aa(lp213
VI'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.
p214
aVIt's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,
p215
aVthe U.S. Institute of Peace.
p216
aVThe site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;
p217
aVyou see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,
p218
aVon access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.
p219
aVThat too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
p222
aVIf it were to be anywhere in Washington,
p223
aVit would be an office building, a conference center,
p224
aVa place for negotiating peace and so on \u2014 all of which the building is \u2014
p225
aVbut by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,
p226
aVthis becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
p227
aVAnd that was a lot of heat to deal with.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces \u2014
p230
aVspaces where research goes on, conference centers,
p231
aVa public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking \u2014
p232
aVand these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,
p233
aVthe plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
p234
aVYou see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,
p235
aVvery transparent and inviting and looking in.
p236
aVAnd then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.
p237
aVAnd what I felt about that building is that it really was a building
p238
aVthat had to do with a lightness of being \u2014 to quote Kundera \u2014
p239
aVthat it had to do with whiteness,
p240
aVit had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.
p241
aVAnd this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.
p242
aa(lp243
VStudies for the structure of the roof,
p244
aVwhich demands maybe new materials:
p245
aVhow to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,
p246
aVhow to make it not capricious.
p247
aVAnd here studying, in three dimensions,
p248
aVhow to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;
p249
aVnot something you feel you could just change
p250
aVbecause you stop the design of that particular process.
p251
aVAnd so it goes.
p252
aa(lp253
VI'd like to conclude by saying something ...
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aVI'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."
p256
aVAnd I know it is not a fashionable term these days,
p257
aVand certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,
p258
aVbut it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.
p259
aVBeauty in the most profound sense of fit.
p260
aVI have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,
p261
aVTheodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.
p262
aVWe call a natural object beautiful because we see
p263
aVthat its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."
p264
aVWell, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.
p265
aVNevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us
p266
aVthat all the forces that have to do with our natural environment
p267
aVhave been fulfilled \u2014 and our human environment \u2014 for that.
p268
aa(lp269
VTwenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,
p270
aVI wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.
p271
aV"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.
p272
aVHe who seeks order shall find gratification.
p273
aVHe who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.
p274
aVHe who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings
p275
aVshall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression
p276
aVshall fall into the pit of arrogance.
p277
aVArrogance is incompatible with nature.
p278
aVThrough nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,
p279
aVwe shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."
p280
