VToday, I'm going to talk about AI and us.
p4
aVAI researchers have always said
p5
aVthat we humans do not need to worry,
p6
aVbecause only menial jobs will be taken over by machines.
p7
aVIs that really true?
p8
aVThey have also said that AI will create new jobs,
p9
aVso those who lose their jobs will find a new one.
p10
aVOf course.
p11
aVBut the real question is:
p12
aVHow many of those who may lose their jobs to AI
p13
aVwill be able to land a new one,
p14
aVespecially when AI is smart enough to learn better than most of us?
p15
aa(lp16
VLet me ask you a question:
p17
aVHow many of you think
p18
aVthat AI will pass the entrance examination of a top university by 2020?
p19
aVOh, so many. OK.
p20
aVSo some of you may say, "Of course, yes!"
p21
aVNow singularity is the issue.
p22
aVAnd some others may say, "Maybe,
p23
aVbecause AI already won against a top Go player."
p24
aVAnd others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh."
p25
aVThat means we do not know the answer yet, right?
p26
aVSo that was the reason why I started Todai Robot Project,
p27
aVmaking an AI which passes the entrance examination
p28
aVof the University of Tokyo,
p29
aVthe top university in Japan.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is our Todai Robot.
p32
aVAnd, of course, the brain of the robot is working in the remote server.
p33
aVIt is now writing a 600-word essay
p34
aVon maritime trade in the 17th century.
p35
aVHow does that sound?
p36
aa(lp37
VWhy did I take the entrance exam as its benchmark?
p38
aVBecause I thought we had to study the performance of AI
p39
aVin comparison to humans,
p40
aVespecially on the skills and expertise
p41
aVwhich are believed to be acquired only by humans
p42
aVand only through education.
p43
aVTo enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,
p44
aVyou have to pass two different types of exams.
p45
aVThe first one is a national standardized test
p46
aVin multiple-choice style.
p47
aVYou have to take seven subjects
p48
aVand achieve a high score \u2014
p49
aVI would say like an 84 percent or more accuracy rate \u2014
p50
aVto be allowed to take the second stage written test
p51
aVprepared by Todai.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo let me first explain how modern AI works,
p54
aVtaking the "Jeopardy!" challenge as an example.
p55
aVHere is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:
p56
aV"Mozart's last symphony shares its name with this planet."
p57
aVInterestingly, a "Jeopardy!" question always asks,
p58
aValways ends with "this" something:
p59
aV"this" planet, "this" country,
p60
aV"this" rock musician, and so on.
p61
aVIn other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask many different types of questions,
p62
aVbut a single type,
p63
aVwhich we call "factoid questions."
p64
aa(lp65
VBy the way, do you know the answer?
p66
aVIf you do not know the answer and if you want to know the answer,
p67
aVwhat would you do?
p68
aVYou Google, right? Of course.
p69
aVWhy not?
p70
aVBut you have to pick appropriate keywords
p71
aVlike "Mozart," "last" and "symphony" to search.
p72
aVThe machine basically does the same.
p73
aVThen this Wikipedia page will be ranked top.
p74
aVThen the machine reads the page.
p75
aVNo, uh-uh.
p76
aa(lp77
VUnfortunately, none of the modern AIs,
p78
aVincluding Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,
p79
aVis able to read.
p80
aVBut they are very good at searching and optimizing.
p81
aVIt will recognize
p82
aVthat the keywords "Mozart," "last" and "symphony"
p83
aVare appearing heavily around here.
p84
aVSo if it can find a word which is a planet
p85
aVand which is co-occurring with these keywords,
p86
aVthat must be the answer.
p87
aVThis is how Watson finds the answer "Jupiter," in this case.
p88
aa(lp89
VOur Todai Robot works similarly, but a bit smarter
p90
aVin answering history yes-no questions,
p91
aVlike, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.' Is this sentence true or false?"
p92
aVOur robot starts producing a factoid question,
p93
aVlike: "Charlemagne repelled [this person type]" by itself.
p94
aVThen, "Avars" but not "Magyars" is ranked top.
p95
aVThis sentence is likely to be false.
p96
aVOur robot does not read, does not understand,
p97
aVbut it is statistically correct in many cases.
p98
aa(lp99
VFor the second stage written test,
p100
aVit is required to write a 600-word essay like this one:
p101
aa(lp102
V[Discuss the rise and fall of the maritime trade
p103
aVin East and Southeast Asia in the 17th century ...]
p104
aa(lp105
Vand as I have shown earlier,
p106
aVour robot took the sentences from the textbooks and Wikipedia,
p107
aVcombined them together,
p108
aVand optimized it to produce an essay
p109
aVwithout understanding a thing.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VBut surprisingly, it wrote a better essay
p114
aVthan most of the students.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VHow about mathematics?
p119
aVA fully automatic math-solving machine
p120
aVhas been a dream
p121
aVsince the birth of the word "artificial intelligence,"
p122
aVbut it has stayed at the level of arithmetic for a long, long time.
p123
aVLast year, we finally succeeded in developing a system
p124
aVwhich solved pre-university-level problems from end to end,
p125
aVlike this one.
p126
aVThis is the original problem written in Japanese,
p127
aVand we had to teach it 2,000 mathematical axioms
p128
aVand 8,000 Japanese words
p129
aVto make it accept the problems written in natural language.
p130
aVAnd it is now translating the original problems
p131
aVinto machine-readable formulas.
p132
aVWeird, but it is now ready to solve it, I think.
p133
aVGo and solve it.
p134
aVYes! It is now executing symbolic computation.
p135
aVEven more weird,
p136
aVbut probably this is the most fun part for the machine.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VNow it outputs a perfect answer,
p141
aVthough its proof is impossible to read, even for mathematicians.
p142
aVAnyway, last year our robot was among the top one percent
p143
aVin the second stage written exam in mathematics.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VThank you.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo, did it enter Todai?
p150
aVNo, not as I expected.
p151
aVWhy?
p152
aVBecause it doesn't understand any meaning.
p153
aVLet me show you a typical error it made in the English test.
p154
aa(lp155
V[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore. Just a few more minutes.
p156
aVSunil: Wait. ______ . Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]
p157
aa(lp158
VTwo people are talking.
p159
aVFor us, who can understand the situation \u2014
p160
aa(lp161
V[1. "We walked for a long time." 2. "We're almost there."
p162
aV3. "Your shoes look expensive." 4. "Your shoelace is untied."]
p163
aa(lp164
Vit is obvious number four is the correct answer, right?
p165
aVBut Todai Robot chose number two,
p166
aVeven after learning 15 billion English sentences
p167
aVusing deep learning technologies.
p168
aVOK, so now you might understand what I said:
p169
aVmodern AIs do not read,
p170
aVdo not understand.
p171
aVThey only disguise as if they do.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis is the distribution graph
p174
aVof half a million students who took the same exam as Todai Robot.
p175
aVNow our Todai Robot is among the top 20 percent,
p176
aVand it was capable to pass
p177
aVmore than 60 percent of the universities in Japan \u2014
p178
aVbut not Todai.
p179
aVBut see how it is beyond the volume zone
p180
aVof to-be white-collar workers.
p181
aa(lp182
VYou might think I was delighted.
p183
aVAfter all, my robot was surpassing students everywhere.
p184
aVInstead, I was alarmed.
p185
aVHow on earth could this unintelligent machine outperform students \u2014
p186
aVour children?
p187
aVRight?
p188
aVI decided to investigate what was going on in the human world.
p189
aVI took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks
p190
aVand made easy multiple-choice quizzes,
p191
aVand asked thousands of high school students to answer.
p192
aa(lp193
VHere is an example:
p194
aa(lp195
V[Buddhism spread to ... , Christianity to ... and Oceania,
p196
aVand Islam to ...]
p197
aa(lp198
VOf course, the original problems are written in Japanese,
p199
aVtheir mother tongue.
p200
aa(lp201
V[ ______ has spread to Oceania.
p202
aV1. Hinduism 2. Christianity 3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]
p203
aa(lp204
VObviously, Christianity is the answer, isn't it?
p205
aVIt's written!
p206
aVAnd Todai Robot chose the correct answer, too.
p207
aVBut one-third of junior high school students
p208
aVfailed to answer this question.
p209
aVDo you think it is only the case in Japan?
p210
aVI do not think so,
p211
aVbecause Japan is always ranked among the top in OECD PISA tests,
p212
aVmeasuring 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics,
p213
aVscience and reading
p214
aVevery three years.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe have been believing
p217
aVthat everybody can learn
p218
aVand learn well,
p219
aVas long as we provide good learning materials
p220
aVfree on the web
p221
aVso that they can access through the internet.
p222
aVBut such wonderful materials may benefit only those who can read well,
p223
aVand the percentage of those who can read well
p224
aVmay be much less than we expected.
p225
aVHow we humans will coexist with AI
p226
aVis something we have to think about carefully,
p227
aVbased on solid evidence.
p228
aVAt the same time, we have to think in a hurry
p229
aVbecause time is running out.
p230
aa(lp231
VThank you.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VChris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.
p236
aa(lp237
VNoriko Arai: Thank you.
p238
aa(lp239
VCA: In your talk, you so beautifully give us a sense of how AIs think,
p240
aVwhat they can do amazingly
p241
aVand what they can't do.
p242
aVBut \u2014 do I read you right,
p243
aVthat you think we really need quite an urgent revolution in education
p244
aVto help kids do the things that humans can do better than AIs?
p245
aa(lp246
VNA: Yes, yes, yes.
p247
aVBecause we humans can understand the meaning.
p248
aVThat is something which is very, very lacking in AI.
p249
aVBut most of the students just pack the knowledge
p250
aVwithout understanding the meaning of the knowledge,
p251
aVso that is not knowledge, that is just memorizing,
p252
aVand AI can do the same thing.
p253
aVSo we have to think about a new type of education.
p254
aa(lp255
VCA: A shift from knowledge, rote knowledge, to meaning.
p256
aa(lp257
VNA: Mm-hmm.
p258
aa(lp259
VCA: Well, there's a challenge for the educators. Thank you so much.
p260
aa(lp261
VNA: Thank you very much. Thank you.
