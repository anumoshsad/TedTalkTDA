VI just did something I've never done before.
p4
aVI spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
p5
aVNow I'm not a scientist,
p6
aVbut I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team
p7
aVfrom the University of South Florida
p8
aVwho have been tracking the travels of BP's oil
p9
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p10
aVThis is the boat we were on, by the way.
p11
aVThe scientists I was with
p12
aVwere not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff \u2014
p13
aVthe birds, the turtles,
p14
aVthe dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
p15
aVThey're looking at the really little stuff
p16
aVthat gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
p17
aVthat eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
p18
aVAnd what they're finding
p19
aVis that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants
p20
aVcan be highly toxic to phytoplankton,
p21
aVwhich is very bad news,
p22
aVbecause so much life depends on it.
p23
aVSo contrary to what we heard a few months back
p24
aVabout how 75 percent of that oil
p25
aVsort of magically disappeared
p26
aVand we didn't have to worry about it,
p27
aVthis disaster is still unfolding.
p28
aVIt's still working its way up the food chain.
p29
aVNow this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
p30
aVRachel Carson \u2014
p31
aVthe godmother of modern environmentalism \u2014
p32
aVwarned us about this very thing
p33
aVback in 1962.
p34
aVShe pointed out that the "control men" \u2014
p35
aVas she called them \u2014
p36
aVwho carpet-bombed towns and fields
p37
aVwith toxic insecticides like DDT,
p38
aVwere only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,
p39
aVnot the birds.
p40
aVBut they forgot this:
p41
aVthe fact that birds dine on grubs,
p42
aVthat robins eat lots of worms
p43
aVnow saturated with DDT.
p44
aVAnd so, robin eggs failed to hatch,
p45
aVsongbirds died en masse,
p46
aVtowns fell silent.
p47
aVThus the title "Silent Spring."
p48
aVI've been trying to pinpoint
p49
aVwhat keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,
p50
aVbecause I'm Canadian,
p51
aVand I can draw no ancestral ties.
p52
aVAnd I think what it is
p53
aVis I don't think we have fully come to terms
p54
aVwith the meaning of this disaster,
p55
aVwith what it meant to witness a hole
p56
aVripped in our world,
p57
aVwith what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth
p58
aVgush forth on live TV,
p59
aV24 hours a day,
p60
aVfor months.
p61
aVAfter telling ourselves for so long
p62
aVthat our tools and technology can control nature,
p63
aVsuddenly we were face-to-face
p64
aVwith our weakness,
p65
aVwith our lack of control,
p66
aVas the oil burst out
p67
aVof every attempt to contain it \u2014
p68
aV"top hats," "top kills"
p69
aVand, most memorably, the "junk shot" \u2014
p70
aVthe bright idea
p71
aVof firing old tires and golf balls
p72
aVdown that hole in the world.
p73
aVBut even more striking
p74
aVthan the ferocious power emanating from that well
p75
aVwas the recklessness
p76
aVwith which that power was unleashed \u2014
p77
aVthe carelessness, the lack of planning
p78
aVthat characterized the operation
p79
aVfrom drilling to clean-up.
p80
aVIf there is one thing
p81
aVBP's watery improv act made clear,
p82
aVit is that, as a culture,
p83
aVwe have become far too willing to gamble
p84
aVwith things that are precious
p85
aVand irreplaceable,
p86
aVand to do so without a back-up plan,
p87
aVwithout an exit strategy.
p88
aVAnd BP was hardly
p89
aVour first experience of this in recent years.
p90
aVOur leaders barrel into wars,
p91
aVtelling themselves happy stories
p92
aVabout cakewalks and welcome parades.
p93
aVThen, it is years of deadly damage control,
p94
aVFrankensteins of sieges and surges
p95
aVand counter-insurgencies,
p96
aVand once again, no exit strategy.
p97
aVOur financial wizards routinely fall victim
p98
aVto similar overconfidence,
p99
aVconvincing themselves that the latest bubble
p100
aVis a new kind of market \u2014
p101
aVthe kind that never goes down.
p102
aVAnd when it inevitably does,
p103
aVthe best and the brightest
p104
aVreach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot \u2014
p105
aVin this case, throwing massive amounts
p106
aVof much-needed public money
p107
aVdown a very different kind of hole.
p108
aVAs with BP, the hole does get plugged,
p109
aVat least temporarily,
p110
aVbut not before
p111
aVexacting a tremendous price.
p112
aVWe have to figure out
p113
aVwhy we keep letting this happen,
p114
aVbecause we are in the midst
p115
aVof what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all \u2014
p116
aVdeciding what to do, or not to do,
p117
aVabout climate change.
p118
aVNow as you know,
p119
aVa great deal of time is spent,
p120
aVin this country and around the world,
p121
aVinside the climate debate,
p122
aVon the question of, "What if the IPC scientists
p123
aVare all wrong?"
p124
aVNow a far more relevant question \u2014
p125
aVas MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it \u2014
p126
aVis, "What if those scientists are right?"
p127
aVGiven the stakes, the climate crisis
p128
aVclearly calls for us to act
p129
aVbased on the precautionary principle \u2014
p130
aVthe theory that holds
p131
aVthat when human health and the environment
p132
aVare significantly at risk
p133
aVand when the potential damage is irreversible,
p134
aVwe cannot afford to wait
p135
aVfor perfect scientific certainty.
p136
aVBetter to err on the side of caution.
p137
aVMore overt, the burden of proving
p138
aVthat a practice is safe
p139
aVshould not be placed on the public that would be harmed,
p140
aVbut rather on the industry that stands to profit.
p141
aVBut climate policy in the wealthy world \u2014
p142
aVto the extent that such a thing exists \u2014
p143
aVis not based on precaution,
p144
aVbut rather on cost-benefit analysis \u2014
p145
aVfinding the course of action that economists believe
p146
aVwill have the least impact
p147
aVon our GDP.
p148
aVSo rather than asking, as precaution would demand,
p149
aVwhat can we do as quickly as possible
p150
aVto avoid potential catastrophe,
p151
aVwe ask bizarre questions like this:
p152
aV"What is the latest possible moment we can wait
p153
aVbefore we begin seriously lowering emissions?
p154
aVCan we put this off till 2020,
p155
aV2030, 2050?"
p156
aVOr we ask,
p157
aV"How much hotter can we let the planet get
p158
aVand still survive?
p159
aVCan we go with two degrees, three degrees, or \u2014
p160
aVwhere we're currently going \u2014
p161
aVfour degrees Celsius?"
p162
aVAnd by the way,
p163
aVthe assumption that we can safely control
p164
aVthe Earth's awesomely complex climate system
p165
aVas if it had a thermostat,
p166
aVmaking the planet not too hot, not too cold,
p167
aVbut just right \u2014 sort of Goldilocks style \u2014
p168
aVthis is pure fantasy,
p169
aVand it's not coming from the climate scientists.
p170
aVIt's coming from the economists
p171
aVimposing their mechanistic thinking
p172
aVon the science.
p173
aVThe fact is that we simply don't know
p174
aVwhen the warming that we create
p175
aVwill be utterly overwhelmed
p176
aVby feedback loops.
p177
aVSo once again,
p178
aVwhy do we take these crazy risks
p179
aVwith the precious?
p180
aVA range of explanations
p181
aVmay be popping into your mind by now,
p182
aVlike "greed."
p183
aVThis is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
p184
aVbecause taking big risks, as we all know,
p185
aVpays a lot of money.
p186
aVAnother explanation that you often hear for recklessness
p187
aVis hubris.
p188
aVAnd greed and hubris
p189
aVare intimately intertwined
p190
aVwhen it comes to recklessness.
p191
aVFor instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker
p192
aVtaking home 100 times more
p193
aVthan a brain surgeon,
p194
aVthen you need a narrative,
p195
aVyou need a story
p196
aVthat makes that disparity okay.
p197
aVAnd you actually don't have a lot of options.
p198
aVYou're either an incredibly good scammer,
p199
aVand you're getting away with it \u2014 you gamed the system \u2014
p200
aVor you're some kind of boy genius,
p201
aVthe likes of which the world has never seen.
p202
aVNow both of these options \u2014 the boy genius and the scammer \u2014
p203
aVare going to make you vastly overconfident
p204
aVand therefore more prone
p205
aVto taking even bigger risks in the future.
p206
aVBy the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,
p207
aVhad a plaque on his desk
p208
aVinscribed with this inspirational slogan:
p209
aV"What would you attempt to do
p210
aVif you knew you could not fail?"
p211
aVNow this is actually a popular plaque,
p212
aVand this is a crowd of overachievers,
p213
aVso I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
p214
aVDon't feel ashamed.
p215
aVPutting fear of failure out of your mind
p216
aVcan be a very good thing
p217
aVif you're training for a triathlon
p218
aVor preparing to give a TEDTalk,
p219
aVbut personally, I think people with the power
p220
aVto detonate our economy and ravage our ecology
p221
aVwould do better having
p222
aVa picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,
p223
aVbecause \u2014 maybe not that one in particular \u2014
p224
aVbut I want them thinking about the possibility of failure
p225
aVall of the time.
p226
aVSo we have greed,
p227
aVwe've got overconfidence/hubris,
p228
aVbut since we're here at TEDWomen,
p229
aVlet's consider one other factor
p230
aVthat could be contributing in some small way
p231
aVto societal recklessness.
p232
aVNow I'm not going to belabor this point,
p233
aVbut studies do show that, as investors,
p234
aVwomen are much less prone
p235
aVto taking reckless risks than men,
p236
aVprecisely because, as we've already heard,
p237
aVwomen tend not to suffer from overconfidence
p238
aVin the same way that men do.
p239
aVSo it turns out
p240
aVthat being paid less and praised less
p241
aVhas its upsides \u2014
p242
aVfor society at least.
p243
aVThe flipside of this
p244
aVis that constantly being told
p245
aVthat you are gifted, chosen
p246
aVand born to rule
p247
aVhas distinct societal downsides.
p248
aVAnd this problem \u2014 call it the "perils of privilege" \u2014
p249
aVbrings us closer, I think,
p250
aVto the root of our collective recklessness.
p251
aVBecause none of us \u2014 at least in the global North \u2014
p252
aVneither men nor women,
p253
aVare fully exempt from this message.
p254
aVHere's what I'm talking about.
p255
aVWhether we actively believe them
p256
aVor consciously reject them,
p257
aVour culture remains in the grips
p258
aVof certain archetypal stories
p259
aVabout our supremacy
p260
aVover others and over nature \u2014
p261
aVthe narrative of the newly discovered frontier
p262
aVand the conquering pioneer,
p263
aVthe narrative of manifest destiny,
p264
aVthe narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
p265
aVAnd just when you think these stories are fading into history,
p266
aVand that we've gotten over them,
p267
aVthey pop up in the strangest places.
p268
aVFor instance, I stumbled across this advertisement
p269
aVoutside the women's washroom
p270
aVin the Kansas City airport.
p271
aVIt's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,
p272
aVand yes, it really does say,
p273
aV"Slap Mother Nature in the face."
p274
aVAnd I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola \u2014
p275
aVthat's just a bonus.
p276
aVI'm showing it because \u2014
p277
aVthey're not a sponsor, are they? \u2014
p278
aVbecause, in its own way,
p279
aVthis is a crass version
p280
aVof our founding story.
p281
aVWe slapped Mother Nature around and won,
p282
aVand we always win,
p283
aVbecause dominating nature is our destiny.
p284
aVBut this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
p285
aVThere's another one, equally important,
p286
aVabout how that very same Mother Nature
p287
aVis so nurturing and so resilient
p288
aVthat we can never make a dent in her abundance.
p289
aVLet's hear from Tony Hayward again.
p290
aV"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
p291
aVThe amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it
p292
aVis tiny in relation to the total water volume."
p293
aVIn other words, the ocean is big;
p294
aVshe can take it.
p295
aVIt is this underlying assumption of limitlessness
p296
aVthat makes it possible
p297
aVto take the reckless risks that we do.
p298
aVBecause this is our real master-narrative:
p299
aVhowever much we mess up,
p300
aVthere will always be more \u2014
p301
aVmore water, more land,
p302
aVmore untapped resources.
p303
aVA new bubble will replace the old one.
p304
aVA new technology will come along
p305
aVto fix the messes we made with the last one.
p306
aVIn a way, that is the story
p307
aVof the settling of the Americas,
p308
aVthe supposedly inexhaustible frontier
p309
aVto which Europeans escaped.
p310
aVAnd it's also the story of modern capitalism,
p311
aVbecause it was the wealth from this land
p312
aVthat gave birth to our economic system,
p313
aVone that cannot survive without perpetual growth
p314
aVand an unending supply
p315
aVof new frontiers.
p316
aVNow the problem is
p317
aVthat the story was always a lie.
p318
aVThe Earth always did have limits.
p319
aVThey were just beyond our sights.
p320
aVAnd now we are hitting those limits
p321
aVon multiple fronts.
p322
aVI believe that we know this,
p323
aVyet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
p324
aVNot only do we continue to tell and retell
p325
aVthe same tired stories,
p326
aVbut we are now doing so
p327
aVwith a frenzy and a fury
p328
aVthat, frankly, verges on camp.
p329
aVHow else to explain the cultural space
p330
aVoccupied by Sarah Palin?
p331
aVNow on the one hand,
p332
aVexhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"
p333
aVbecause God put those resources into the ground
p334
aVin order for us to exploit them,
p335
aVand on the other, glorying in the wilderness
p336
aVof Alaska's untouched beauty
p337
aVon her hit reality TV show.
p338
aVThe twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
p339
aVIgnore those creeping fears
p340
aVthat we have finally hit the wall.
p341
aVThere are still no limits.
p342
aVThere will always be another frontier.
p343
aVSo stop worrying and keep shopping.
p344
aVNow, would that this were just about
p345
aVSarah Palin and her reality TV show.
p346
aVIn environmental circles,
p347
aVwe often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,
p348
aVwe are continuing with business as usual.
p349
aVThis assessment, unfortunately,
p350
aVis far too optimistic.
p351
aVThe truth is that we have already exhausted
p352
aVso much of the easily accessible fossil fuels
p353
aVthat we have already entered
p354
aVa far riskier business era,
p355
aVthe era of extreme energy.
p356
aVSo that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,
p357
aVincluding the icy Arctic seas,
p358
aVwhere a clean-up may simply be impossible.
p359
aVIt means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas
p360
aVand massive strip-mining operations for coal,
p361
aVthe likes of which we haven't yet seen.
p362
aVAnd most controversially, it means the tar sands.
p363
aVI'm always surprised by how little
p364
aVpeople outside of Canada
p365
aVknow about the Alberta Tar Sands,
p366
aVwhich this year are projected to become
p367
aVthe number one source of imported oil
p368
aVto the United States.
p369
aVIt's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,
p370
aVbecause I believe it speaks to recklessness
p371
aVand the path we're on
p372
aVlike little else.
p373
aVSo this is where the tar sands live,
p374
aVunder one of the last magnificent
p375
aVBoreal forests.
p376
aVThe oil is not liquid.
p377
aVYou can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
p378
aVTar sand's oil is solid,
p379
aVmixed in with the soil.
p380
aVSo to get at it,
p381
aVyou first have to get rid of the trees.
p382
aVThen, you rip off the topsoil
p383
aVand get at that oily sand.
p384
aVThe process requires a huge amount of water,
p385
aVwhich is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
p386
aVThat's very bad news for local indigenous people
p387
aVliving downstream
p388
aVwho are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
p389
aVNow looking at these images,
p390
aVit's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,
p391
aVwhich can already be seen from space
p392
aVand could grow to an area the size of England.
p393
aVI find it helps actually
p394
aVto look at the dump trucks that move the earth,
p395
aVthe largest ever built.
p396
aVThat's a person down there by the wheel.
p397
aVMy point is that
p398
aVthis is not oil drilling.
p399
aVIt's not even mining.
p400
aVIt is terrestrial skinning.
p401
aVVast, vivid landscapes
p402
aVare being gutted,
p403
aVleft monochromatic gray.
p404
aVNow I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned
p405
aVthis would be an abomination
p406
aVif it emitted not one particle of carbon.
p407
aVBut the truth is that, on average,
p408
aVturning that gunk into crude oil
p409
aVproduces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution
p410
aVthan it does to produce conventional oil
p411
aVin Canada.
p412
aVHow else to describe this,
p413
aVbut as a form of mass insanity?
p414
aVJust when we know we need to be learning
p415
aVto live on the surface of our planet,
p416
aVoff the power of sun, wind and waves,
p417
aVwe are frantically digging
p418
aVto get at the dirtiest,
p419
aVhighest-emitting stuff imaginable.
p420
aVThis is where our story of endless growth
p421
aVhas taken us,
p422
aVto this black hole at the center of my country \u2014
p423
aVa place of such planetary pain
p424
aVthat, like the BP gusher,
p425
aVone can only stand to look at it for so long.
p426
aVAs Jared Diamond and others have shown us,
p427
aVthis is how civilizations commit suicide,
p428
aVby slamming their foot on the accelerator
p429
aVat the exact moment
p430
aVwhen they should be putting on the brakes.
p431
aVThe problem is that our master-narrative
p432
aVhas an answer for that too.
p433
aVAt the very last minute, we are going to get saved
p434
aVjust like in every Hollywood movie,
p435
aVjust like in the Rapture.
p436
aVBut, of course, our secular religion is technology.
p437
aVNow, you may have noticed
p438
aVmore and more headlines like these.
p439
aVThe idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,
p440
aVis that, as the planet heats up,
p441
aVwe may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
p442
aVinto the stratosphere
p443
aVto reflect some of the sun's rays
p444
aVback to space,
p445
aVthereby cooling the planet.
p446
aVThe wackiest plan \u2014 and I'm not making this up \u2014
p447
aVwould put what is essentially a garden hose
p448
aV18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,
p449
aVsuspended by balloons,
p450
aVto spew sulfur dioxide.
p451
aVSo, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
p452
aVThink of it as the ultimate junk shot.
p453
aVThe serious scientists involved in this research
p454
aVall stress that these techniques
p455
aVare entirely untested.
p456
aVThey don't know if they'll work,
p457
aVand they have no idea
p458
aVwhat kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
p459
aVNevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering
p460
aVis being greeted in some circles,
p461
aVparticularly media circles,
p462
aVwith a relief tinged with euphoria.
p463
aVAn escape hatch has been reached.
p464
aVA new frontier has been found.
p465
aVMost importantly,
p466
aVwe don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
p467
aVYou see, for some people,
