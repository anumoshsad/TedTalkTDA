VThe Earth needs no introduction.
p4
aVIt needs no introduction in part  because the Apollo 17 astronauts,
p5
aVwhen they were hurtling  around the moon in 1972,
p6
aVtook this iconic image.
p7
aVIt galvanized a whole  generation of human beings
p8
aVto realize that we're on  Spaceship Earth,
p9
aVfragile and finite as it is,
p10
aVand that we need  to take care of it.
p11
aVBut while this picture is beautiful, it's static,
p12
aVand the Earth is constantly changing.
p13
aVIt's changing on days' time scales with human activity.
p14
aVAnd the satellite imagery we  have of it today is old.
p15
aVTypically, years old.
p16
aVAnd that's important because you can't fix what you can't see.
p17
aVWhat we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day.
p18
aVSo, what's standing in our way?
p19
aa(lp20
VWhat's the problem?
p21
aVThis is the problem:
p22
aVSatellites are big, expensive  and they're slow.
p23
aVThis one weighs three tons.
p24
aVIt's six meters tall, four meters wide.
p25
aVIt took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it.
p26
aVOne satellite, one rocket.
p27
aVIt cost 855 million dollars.
p28
aVSatellites like these have  done an amazing job
p29
aVat helping us to understand our planet.
p30
aVBut if we want to understand  it much more regularly,
p31
aVwe need lots of satellites,
p32
aVand this model isn't scalable.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo me and my friends,  we started Planet Labs
p35
aVto make satellites ultra-compact
p36
aVand small and highly capable.
p37
aVI'm going to show you what  our satellite looks like:
p38
aVThis is our satellite.
p39
aa(lp40
VThis is not a scale model,
p41
aVthis is the real size.
p42
aVIt's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,
p43
aVit weighs four kilograms,
p44
aVand we've stuffed the latest  and greatest electronics
p45
aVand sensor systems into  this little package
p46
aVso that even though this is really small,
p47
aVthis can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here,
p48
aVeven though it weighs one  thousandth of the mass.
p49
aVAnd we call this satellite  "Dove" \u2014 Thank you.
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aVWe call this satellite "Dove,"
p52
aVand we call it "Dove" because  satellites are typically named
p53
aVafter birds, but normally birds of prey:
p54
aVlike Eagle, Hawk, Swoop,  Kill, I don't know,
p55
aVKestrel, these sort of things.
p56
aVBut ours have a  humanitarian mission,
p57
aVso we wanted to call them Doves.
p58
aVAnd we haven't just  built them, though.
p59
aVWe've launched them.
p60
aVAnd not just one, but many.
p61
aa(lp62
VIt all started in our garage.
p63
aVYes, we built our first satellite prototype in our garage.
p64
aVNow, this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are,
p65
aVbut we believe it's the first time  for a space company.
p66
aVAnd that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley.
p67
aVWe rapidly prototype our satellites.
p68
aVWe use "release early,  release often" on our software.
p69
aVAnd we take a different  risk approach.
p70
aVWe take them outside and test them.
p71
aVWe even put satellites in space just to test the satellites,
p72
aVand we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale.
p73
aVWe've used modern production techniques
p74
aVso we can build large numbers of them,
p75
aVI think for the first time.
p76
aVWe call it agile aerospace,
p77
aVand that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, what has bonded  our team over the years
p80
aVis the idea of democratizing access to satellite information.
p81
aVIn fact, the founders of our  company, Chris, Robbie and I,
p82
aVwe met over 15 years ago  at the United Nations
p83
aVwhen they were hosting a conference  about exactly that question:
p84
aVHow do you use satellites  to help humanity?
p85
aVHow do you use satellites to help  people in developing countries
p86
aVor with climate change?
p87
aVAnd this is what has bonded us.
p88
aVOur entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity.
p89
aVYou could say  we're space geeks,
p90
aVbut not only do we care  about what's up there,
p91
aVwe care about what's down here, too.
p92
aa(lp93
VI'm going to show you a video
p94
aVfrom just four weeks ago  of two of our satellites
p95
aVbeing launched from the International Space Station.
p96
aVThis is not an animation,
p97
aVthis is a video taken by the astronaut  looking out of the window.
p98
aVIt gives you a bit of a sense of  scale of our two satellites.
p99
aVIt's like some of the  smallest satellites ever
p100
aVare being launched from  the biggest satellite ever.
p101
aVAnd right at the end, the solar array glints in the sun.
p102
aVIt's really cool. Wait for it.
p103
aVBoom! Yeah. It's the money shot.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo we didn't just launch  two of them like this,
p107
aVwe launched 28 of them.
p108
aVIt's the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history,
p109
aVand it's going to provide a completely radical new data set
p110
aVabout our changing planet.
p111
aVBut that's just the beginning.
p112
aVYou see, we're going to launch more than 100 of these satellites
p113
aVlike these over the  course of the next year.
p114
aVIt's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history.
p115
aVAnd this is what it's going to do:
p116
aVActing in a single-orbit plane that  stays fixed with respect to the sun,
p117
aVthe Earth rotates underneath.
p118
aVThey're all cameras pointed down,
p119
aVand they slowly scan across as  the Earth rotates underneath.
p120
aVThe Earth rotates every 24 hours,
p121
aVso we scan every point on the  planet every 24 hours.
p122
aVIt's a line scanner for the planet.
p123
aVWe don't take a picture of  anywhere on the planet every day,
p124
aVwe take a picture of every single place on the planet every day.
p125
aVEven though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago,
p126
aVwe've already got some initial imagery from the satellites
p127
aVand I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now.
p128
aVThis is the very first picture taken by our satellite.
p129
aVIt happened to be over  UC-Davis' campus
p130
aVin California when we  turned the camera on.
p131
aVBut what's even cooler is when
p132
aVwe compare it to the previous latest image of that area,
p133
aVwhich was taken many months ago.
p134
aVAnd the image on the left  is from our satellite,
p135
aVand we see buildings are being built.
p136
aVThe general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens
p137
aVaround the whole world in all cities, every day.
p138
aa(lp139
VWater as well.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you.
p142
aV(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VWe'll be able to see  the extent of all water bodies
p145
aVaround the whole world every day and help water security.
p146
aVFrom water security  to food security.
p147
aVWe'll see crops as they  grow in all the fields
p148
aVin every farmer's field around the planet every day.
p149
aVand help them to improve crop yield.
p150
aVThis is a beautiful image that was taken
p151
aVjust a few hours ago when the  satellite was flying over Argentina.
p152
aVThe general point is
p153
aVthere are probably hundreds and  thousands of applications of this data,
p154
aVI've mentioned a few, but there's others:
p155
aVdeforestation, the ice caps melting.
p156
aVWe can track all of these things, every tree on the planet every day.
p157
aVIf you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image,
p158
aVyou'd see much of the world news \u2014 you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.
p159
aVAnd we have decided, therefore, that the  best thing that we could do with our data
p160
aVis to ensure universal access to it.
p161
aVWe want to ensure everyone can see it.
p162
aVThank you. (Applause)
p163
aVWe want to empower NGOs and  companies and scientists and journalists
p164
aVto be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet.
p165
aVWe want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data.
p166
aVIn short, we want to democratize access to information about our planet.
p167
aa(lp168
VWhich brings me back to this.
p169
aVYou see, this will be an entirely new global data set.
p170
aVAnd we believe that together,
p171
aVwe can help to take care  of our Spaceship Earth.
p172
aVAnd what I would like to leave you with is the following question:
p173
aVIf you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day,
p174
aVwhat would you do with that data?
p175
aVWhat problems would you solve?
p176
aVWhat exploration would you do?
p177
aVWell, I invite you to come and explore with us.
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you very much.
