VTo understand the business of mythology
p4
aVand what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,
p5
aVyou have to hear a story
p6
aVof Ganesha,
p7
aVthe elephant-headed god
p8
aVwho is the scribe of storytellers,
p9
aVand his brother,
p10
aVthe athletic warlord of the gods,
p11
aVKartikeya.
p12
aVThe two brothers one day decided to go on a race,
p13
aVthree times around the world.
p14
aVKartikeya leapt on his peacock
p15
aVand flew around the continents
p16
aVand the mountains and the oceans.
p17
aVHe went around once,
p18
aVhe went around twice,
p19
aVhe went around thrice.
p20
aVBut his brother, Ganesha,
p21
aVsimply walked around his parents
p22
aVonce, twice, thrice,
p23
aVand said, "I won."
p24
aV"How come?" said Kartikeya.
p25
aVAnd Ganesha said,
p26
aV"You went around 'the world.'
p27
aVI went around 'my world.'"
p28
aVWhat matters more?
p29
aa(lp30
VIf you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'
p31
aVyou understand the difference between logos and mythos.
p32
aV'The world' is objective,
p33
aVlogical, universal, factual,
p34
aVscientific.
p35
aV'My world' is subjective.
p36
aVIt's emotional. It's personal.
p37
aVIt's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.
p38
aVIt is the belief system that we carry.
p39
aVIt's the myth that we live in.
p40
aa(lp41
V'The world' tells us how the world functions,
p42
aVhow the sun rises,
p43
aVhow we are born.
p44
aV'My world' tells us why the sun rises,
p45
aVwhy we were born.
p46
aVEvery culture is trying to understand itself:
p47
aV"Why do we exist?"
p48
aVAnd every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,
p49
aVits own customized version of mythology.
p50
aa(lp51
VCulture is a reaction to nature,
p52
aVand this understanding of our ancestors
p53
aVis transmitted generation from generation
p54
aVin the form of stories, symbols and rituals,
p55
aVwhich are always indifferent to rationality.
p56
aVAnd so, when you study it, you realize
p57
aVthat different people of the world
p58
aVhave a different understanding of the world.
p59
aVDifferent people see things differently \u2014
p60
aVdifferent viewpoints.
p61
aa(lp62
VThere is my world and there is your world,
p63
aVand my world is always better than your world,
p64
aVbecause my world, you see, is rational
p65
aVand yours is superstition.
p66
aVYours is faith.
p67
aVYours is illogical.
p68
aVThis is the root of the clash of civilizations.
p69
aVIt took place, once, in 326 B.C.
p70
aVon the banks of a river called the Indus,
p71
aVnow in Pakistan.
p72
aVThis river lends itself to India's name.
p73
aVIndia. Indus.
p74
aa(lp75
VAlexander, a young Macedonian,
p76
aVmet there what he called a "gymnosophist,"
p77
aVwhich means "the naked, wise man."
p78
aVWe don't know who he was.
p79
aVPerhaps he was a Jain monk,
p80
aVlike Bahubali over here,
p81
aVthe Gomateshwara Bahubali
p82
aVwhose image is not far from Mysore.
p83
aVOr perhaps he was just a yogi
p84
aVwho was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky
p85
aVand the sun and the moon.
p86
aa(lp87
VAlexander asked, "What are you doing?"
p88
aVand the gymnosophist answered,
p89
aV"I'm experiencing nothingness."
p90
aVThen the gymnosophist asked,
p91
aV"What are you doing?"
p92
aVand Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."
p93
aVAnd they both laughed.
p94
aVEach one thought that the other was a fool.
p95
aVThe gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?
p96
aVIt's pointless."
p97
aVAnd Alexander thought,
p98
aV"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?
p99
aVWhat a waste of a life."
p100
aa(lp101
VTo understand this difference in viewpoints,
p102
aVwe have to understand
p103
aVthe subjective truth of Alexander \u2014
p104
aVhis myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
p105
aVAlexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle
p106
aVtold him the story of Homer's "Iliad."
p107
aVThey told him of a great hero called Achilles,
p108
aVwho, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,
p109
aVbut when he withdrew from the battle,
p110
aVdefeat was inevitable.
p111
aV"Achilles was a man who could shape history,
p112
aVa man of destiny,
p113
aVand this is what you should be, Alexander."
p114
aVThat's what he heard.
p115
aa(lp116
V"What should you not be?
p117
aVYou should not be Sisyphus,
p118
aVwho rolls a rock up a mountain all day
p119
aVonly to find the boulder rolled down at night.
p120
aVDon't live a life which is monotonous,
p121
aVmediocre, meaningless.
p122
aVBe spectacular! \u2014
p123
aVlike the Greek heroes,
p124
aVlike Jason, who went across the sea
p125
aVwith the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.
p126
aVBe spectacular like Theseus,
p127
aVwho entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.
p128
aVWhen you play in a race, win! \u2014
p129
aVbecause when you win, the exhilaration of victory
p130
aVis the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."
p131
aa(lp132
VBecause, you see, the Greeks believed
p133
aVyou live only once,
p134
aVand when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.
p135
aVAnd if you have lived an extraordinary life,
p136
aVyou will be welcomed to Elysium,
p137
aVor what the French call "Champs-Élysées" \u2014
p138
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p139
aVthe heaven of the heroes.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.
p142
aVHe heard a very different story.
p143
aVHe heard of a man called Bharat,
p144
aVafter whom India is called Bh\u0101rata.
p145
aVBharat also conquered the world.
p146
aVAnd then he went to the top-most peak
p147
aVof the greatest mountain of the center of the world
p148
aVcalled Meru.
p149
aVAnd he wanted to hoist his flag to say,
p150
aV"I was here first."
p151
aVBut when he reached the mountain peak,
p152
aVhe found the peak covered with countless flags
p153
aVof world-conquerors before him,
p154
aVeach one claiming "'I was here first' ...
p155
aVthat's what I thought until I came here."
p156
aVAnd suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,
p157
aVBharat felt insignificant.
p158
aVThis was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
p159
aa(lp160
VYou see, he had heroes, like Ram \u2014 Raghupati Ram
p161
aVand Krishna, Govinda Hari.
p162
aVBut they were not two characters on two different adventures.
p163
aVThey were two lifetimes of the same hero.
p164
aVWhen the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.
p165
aVWhen Ram dies, Krishna is born.
p166
aVWhen Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.
p167
aa(lp168
VYou see, the Indians also had a river
p169
aVthat separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.
p170
aVBut you don't cross it once.
p171
aVYou go to and fro endlessly.
p172
aVIt was called the Vaitarani.
p173
aVYou go again and again and again.
p174
aVBecause, you see,
p175
aVnothing lasts forever in India, not even death.
p176
aVAnd so, you have these grand rituals
p177
aVwhere great images of mother goddesses are built
p178
aVand worshiped for 10 days ...
p179
aVAnd what do you do at the end of 10 days?
p180
aVYou dunk it in the river.
p181
aVBecause it has to end.
p182
aVAnd next year, she will come back.
p183
aVWhat goes around always comes around,
p184
aVand this rule applies not just to man,
p185
aVbut also the gods.
p186
aVYou see, the gods
p187
aVhave to come back again and again and again
p188
aVas Ram, as Krishna.
p189
aVNot only do they live infinite lives,
p190
aVbut the same life is lived infinite times
p191
aVtill you get to the point of it all.
p192
aV"Groundhog Day."
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VTwo different mythologies.
p196
aVWhich is right?
p197
aVTwo different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.
p198
aVOne linear, one cyclical.
p199
aVOne believes this is the one and only life.
p200
aVThe other believes this is one of many lives.
p201
aVAnd so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.
p202
aVSo, the value of his life was the sum total
p203
aVof his achievements.
p204
aVThe denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.
p205
aVSo, no matter what he did,
p206
aVit was always zero.
p207
aVAnd I believe it is this mythological paradigm
p208
aVthat inspired Indian mathematicians
p209
aVto discover the number zero.
p210
aVWho knows?
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd that brings us to the mythology of business.
p213
aVIf Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,
p214
aVif the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,
p215
aVthen it was bound to influence the business they were in.
p216
aVYou see, what is business
p217
aVbut the result of how the market behaves
p218
aVand how the organization behaves?
p219
aVAnd if you look at cultures around the world,
p220
aVall you have to do is understand the mythology
p221
aVand you will see how they behave and how they do business.
p222
aa(lp223
VTake a look.
p224
aVIf you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,
p225
aVyou will see an obsession with binary logic,
p226
aVabsolute truth, standardization,
p227
aVabsoluteness, linear patterns in design.
p228
aVBut if you look at cultures which have cyclical
p229
aVand based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,
p230
aVwith opinion,
p231
aVwith contextual thinking,
p232
aVwith everything is relative, sort of \u2014
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVmostly.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VYou look at art. Look at the ballerina,
p238
aVhow linear she is in her performance.
p239
aVAnd then look at the Indian classical dancer,
p240
aVthe Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,
p241
aVcurvaceous.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd then look at business.
p245
aVStandard business model:
p246
aVvision, mission, values, processes.
p247
aVSounds very much like the journey through
p248
aVthe wilderness to the promised land,
p249
aVwith the commandments held by the leader.
p250
aVAnd if you comply, you will go to heaven.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut in India there is no "the" promised land.
p253
aVThere are many promised lands,
p254
aVdepending on your station in society,
p255
aVdepending on your stage of life.
p256
aVYou see, businesses are not run as institutions,
p257
aVby the idiosyncrasies of individuals.
p258
aVIt's always about taste.
p259
aVIt's always about my taste.
p260
aa(lp261
VYou see, Indian music, for example,
p262
aVdoes not have the concept of harmony.
p263
aVThere is no orchestra conductor.
p264
aVThere is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.
p265
aVAnd you can never replicate that performance twice.
p266
aVIt is not about documentation and contract.
p267
aVIt's about conversation and faith.
p268
aVIt's not about compliance. It's about setting,
p269
aVgetting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules \u2014
p270
aVjust look at your Indian people around here,
p271
aVyou'll see them smile; they know what it is.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVAnd then look at people who have done business in India,
p274
aVyou'll see the exasperation on their faces.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aV(Applause)
p277
aa(lp278
VYou see, this is what India is today. The ground reality
p279
aVis based on a cyclical world view.
p280
aVSo, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,
p281
aVchaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.
p282
aVAnd people are okay with it.
p283
aVAnd then globalization is taking place.
p284
aVThe demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.
p285
aVWhich is rooted in one-life culture.
p286
aVAnd a clash is going to take place,
p287
aVlike on the banks of the Indus.
p288
aVIt is bound to happen.
p289
aa(lp290
VI have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.
p291
aVI did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.
p292
aVI love mythology too much.
p293
aVI wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.
p294
aVSo, I had to teach it to myself.
p295
aVAnd mythology does not pay, well, until now.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVSo, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.
p298
aVAnd I worked in the healthcare industry.
p299
aVAnd I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,
p300
aVand a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.
p301
aVI even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.
p302
aVAnd I would see the exasperation
p303
aVbetween my American and European colleagues,
p304
aVwhen they were dealing with India.
p305
aa(lp306
VExample: Please tell us the process
p307
aVto invoice hospitals.
p308
aVStep A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVHow do you parameterize "mostly"?
p311
aVHow do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.
p312
aa(lp313
VI would give my viewpoints to people.
p314
aVBut nobody was interested in listening to it,
p315
aVyou see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.
p316
aVYou see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.
p317
aVAnd there are more than 200 formats,
p318
aVacross 50 cities and towns of India.
p319
aVAnd he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.
p320
aVAnd he knew very intuitively,
p321
aVthat best practices,
p322
aVdeveloped in Japan and China and Europe and America
p323
aVwill not work in India.
p324
aVHe knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.
p325
aVHe had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,
p328
aV"All I want to do is align belief."
p329
aVSounds so simple.
p330
aVBut belief is not measurable.
p331
aVYou can't measure it. You can't manage it.
p332
aVSo, how do you construct belief?
p333
aVHow do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.
p334
aVEven if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,
p337
aVwhich is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.
p338
aVAnd I will share one of the rituals with you.
p339
aVYou see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
p340
aVHindus don't have the concept of commandments.
p341
aVSo, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.
p342
aVSo, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.
p343
aVSo, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.
p344
aVYou want to see God.
p345
aVAnd you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,
p346
aVlarge unblinking eyes,
p347
aVsometimes made of silver,
p348
aVso they look at you.
p349
aVBecause you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek
p350
aVis divine empathy.
p351
aV"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aV"Why did I do the setting,
p354
aVwhy I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.
p357
aVAfter a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,
p358
aVwe blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,
p359
aVthe customer, his family, his team, his boss.
p360
aVYou read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,
p361
aVand then you remove the blindfold.
p362
aVAnd invariably, you see a tear,
p363
aVbecause the penny has dropped.
p364
aVHe realizes that to succeed,
p365
aVhe does not have to be a "professional,"
p366
aVhe does not have to cut out his emotions,
p367
aVhe has to include all these people
p368
aVin his world to succeed, to make them happy,
p369
aVto make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
p370
aVThe customer is happy, because the customer is God.
p371
aa(lp372
VThat sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,
p373
aVbehavior will happen, business will happen.
p374
aVAnd it has.
p375
aVSo, then we come back to Alexander
p376
aVand to the gymnosophist.
p377
aVAnd everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"
p378
aVAnd it's a very dangerous question,
p379
aVbecause it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
p380
aVSo, I will not answer the question.
p381
aVWhat I will give you is an Indian answer,
p382
aVthe Indian head-shake.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aV(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VDepending on the context,
p387
aVdepending on the outcome,
p388
aVchoose your paradigm.
p389
aVYou see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.
p390
aVThey are cultural creations,
p391
aVnot natural phenomena.
p392
aVAnd so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,
p393
aVone request:
p394
aVUnderstand that you live in the subjective truth,
p395
aVand so does he.
p396
aVUnderstand it.
p397
aVAnd when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
p398
aVYou will discover that within infinite myths
p399
aVlies the eternal truth.
p400
aVWho sees it all?
p401
aVVaruna has but a thousand eyes.
p402
aVIndra, a hundred.
p403
aVYou and I, only two.
p404
aVThank you. Namaste.
