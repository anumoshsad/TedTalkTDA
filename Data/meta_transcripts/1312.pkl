VI've spent the last decade
p4
aVsubjecting myself to pain and humiliation,
p5
aVhopefully for a good cause,
p6
aVwhich is self-improvement.
p7
aVAnd I've done this in three parts.
p8
aVSo first I started with the mind.
p9
aVAnd I decided to try to get smarter
p10
aVby reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica
p11
aVfrom A to Z \u2014
p12
aVor, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."
p13
aVAnd here's a little image of that.
p14
aVAnd this was an amazing year.
p15
aVIt was really a fascinating journey.
p16
aVIt was painful at times,
p17
aVespecially for those around me.
p18
aVMy wife started to fine me one dollar
p19
aVfor every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.
p20
aVSo it had its downsides.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut after that,
p23
aVI decided to work on the spirit.
p24
aVAs I mentioned last year,
p25
aVI grew up with no religion at all.
p26
aVI'm Jewish,
p27
aVbut I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVNot really.
p30
aVBut I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage
p31
aVby actually diving in
p32
aVand trying to live it and immerse myself in it.
p33
aVSo I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.
p34
aVAnd from the Ten Commandments
p35
aVto growing my beard \u2014
p36
aVbecause Leviticus says you cannot shave.
p37
aVSo this is what I looked like by the end.
p38
aVThank you for that reaction.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVI look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.
p41
aVI got both of them.
p42
aVSo there was the topiary there.
p43
aVAnd there's the sheep.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow the final part of the trilogy
p46
aVwas I wanted to focus on the body
p47
aVand try to be the healthiest person I could be,
p48
aVthe healthiest person alive.
p49
aVSo that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.
p50
aVAnd I just finished a couple of months ago.
p51
aVAnd I have to say, thank God.
p52
aVBecause living so healthily was killing me.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVIt was so overwhelming,
p55
aVbecause the amount of things you have to do,
p56
aVit's just mind-boggling.
p57
aVI was listening to all the experts
p58
aVand talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.
p59
aVAnd they were telling me
p60
aVall the things I had to do.
p61
aVI had to eat right,
p62
aVexercise, meditate, pet dogs,
p63
aVbecause that lowers the blood pressure.
p64
aVI wrote the book on a treadmill,
p65
aVand it took me about a thousand miles
p66
aVto write the book.
p67
aVI had to put on sunscreen.
p68
aVThis was no small feat,
p69
aVbecause if you listen to dermatologists,
p70
aVthey say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.
p71
aVAnd you have to reapply it every two to four hours.
p72
aVSo I think half of my book advance
p73
aVwent into sunscreen.
p74
aVI was like a glazed doughnut
p75
aVfor most of the year.
p76
aVThere was the washing of hands.
p77
aVI had to do that properly.
p78
aVAnd my immunologist told me
p79
aVthat I should also wipe down
p80
aVall of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,
p81
aVbecause those are just orgies of germs.
p82
aVSo that took a lot of time.
p83
aa(lp84
VI also tried to be the safest person I could be,
p85
aVbecause that's a part of health.
p86
aVI was inspired
p87
aVby the Danish Safety Council.
p88
aVThey started a public campaign
p89
aVthat says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."
p90
aVSo they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,
p91
aVbut also for walking around.
p92
aVAnd you can see there
p93
aVthey're shopping with their helmets.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVWell yeah, I tried that.
p96
aVNow it's a little extreme, I admit.
p97
aVBut if you think about this,
p98
aVthis is actually \u2014 the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this \u2014
p99
aVthat more people die on a per mile basis
p100
aVfrom drunk walking
p101
aVthan from drunk driving.
p102
aVSo something to think about tonight
p103
aVif you've had a couple.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I finished,
p106
aVand it was a success in a sense.
p107
aVAll of the markers went in the right direction.
p108
aVMy cholesterol went down, I lost weight,
p109
aVmy wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.
p110
aVSo that was nice.
p111
aVAnd it was successful overall.
p112
aVBut I also learned that I was too healthy,
p113
aVand that was unhealthy.
p114
aVI was so focused on doing all these things
p115
aVthat I was neglecting my friends and family.
p116
aVAnd as Dan Buettner can tell you,
p117
aVhaving a strong social network
p118
aVis so crucial to our health.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I finished.
p121
aVAnd I kind of went overboard
p122
aVon the week after the project was over.
p123
aVI went to the dark side,
p124
aVand I just indulged myself.
p125
aVIt was like something out of Caligula.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVWithout the sex part.
p128
aVBecause I have three young kids,
p129
aVso that wasn't happening.
p130
aVBut the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.
p131
aVAnd I finally have stabilized.
p132
aVSo now I'm back
p133
aVto adopting many \u2014 not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore \u2014
p134
aVbut dozens of healthy behaviors
p135
aVthat I adopted during my year.
p136
aVIt was really a life-changing project.
p137
aVAnd I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.
p138
aVLet me just tell you two really quickly.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe first is \u2014 and this was surprising to me;
p141
aVI didn't expect this to come out \u2014
p142
aVbut I live a much quieter life now.
p143
aVBecause we live in such a noisy world.
p144
aVThere's trains and planes and cars
p145
aVand Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVAnd this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard \u2014
p148
aVnot just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,
p149
aVbut it actually initiates
p150
aVthe fight-or-flight response.
p151
aVA loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.
p152
aVAnd this, over the years,
p153
aVcan cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.
p154
aVThe World Health Organization just did a big study
p155
aVthat they published this year.
p156
aVAnd it was done in Europe.
p157
aVAnd they estimated
p158
aVthat 1.6 million years of healthy living
p159
aVare lost every year in Europe
p160
aVbecause of noise pollution.
p161
aVSo they think it's actually very deadly.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd by the way,
p164
aVit's also terrible for your brain.
p165
aVIt really impairs cognition.
p166
aVAnd our Founding Fathers knew about this.
p167
aVWhen they wrote the Constitution,
p168
aVthey put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall
p169
aVso that they could concentrate.
p170
aVSo without noise reduction technology,
p171
aVour country would not exist.
p172
aVSo as a patriot,
p173
aVI felt it was important to \u2014
p174
aVI wear all the earplugs and the earphones,
p175
aVand it's really improved my life
p176
aVin a surprising and unexpected way.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd the second point I want to make, the final point,
p179
aVis that \u2014 and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED \u2014
p180
aVthat joy is so important to your health,
p181
aVthat very few of these behaviors
p182
aVwill stick with me
p183
aVunless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.
p184
aVAnd just to give you one instance of this:
p185
aVfood.
p186
aVThe junk food industry
p187
aVis really great
p188
aVat pressing our pleasure buttons
p189
aVand figuring out what's the most pleasurable.
p190
aVBut I think we can use their techniques
p191
aVand apply them to healthy food.
p192
aVTo give just one example,
p193
aVwe love crunchiness, mouthfeel.
p194
aVSo I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness
p195
aVinto a lot of my recipes \u2014
p196
aVthrow in some sunflower seeds.
p197
aVAnd you can almost trick yourself
p198
aVinto thinking you're eating Doritos.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVAnd it has made me a healthier person.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo that is it.
p203
aVThe book about it comes out in April.
p204
aVIt's called "Drop Dead Healthy."
p205
aVAnd I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.
p206
aVThat's my greatest hope.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo thank you very much.
