VHi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress.
p4
aVSince we are still realizing these works,
p5
aVwe are largely working within the realm
p6
aVof intuition and mystery, still.
p7
aVSo I'm going to try and describe
p8
aVsome of the experiences that we're looking for
p9
aVthrough each of the works.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.
p12
aVA viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,
p13
aVand catches a glimpse of these panels
p14
aVin a messy composition on the wall.
p15
aVWithin seconds, as if the panels have noticed
p16
aVthe presence of the viewer,
p17
aVthey appear to panic and sort of get into
p18
aVa strict symmetry.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVSo this is the sketch of the two states.
p21
aVOne is total chaos. The other is absolute order.
p22
aVAnd we were interested in seeing how little change
p23
aVit takes to move from one state to the other state.
p24
aVThis also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions.
p25
aVOne is the altar tablets of the 15th century,
p26
aVand the other is about 100 years ago,
p27
aVMalevich's abstract compositions.
p28
aVSo I'm just going to take you to a video.
p29
aVTo give you a sense of scale,
p30
aVthe largest panel is about two meters high.
p31
aVThat's about this much.  And the smallest one is an A4.
p32
aVSo a viewer enters the space,
p33
aVand they snap to attention.
p34
aVAnd after a while, if the viewer continues
p35
aVto remain in the space,
p36
aVthe panels will sort of become immune
p37
aVto the presence of the viewer
p38
aVand become lax and autonomous again,
p39
aVuntil they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement,
p40
aVwhen they will again snap to attention.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVSo here it appears as if it's the viewer
p43
aVthat's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels,
p44
aVbut it could also be the other way around,
p45
aVthat the panels are so stuck within
p46
aVtheir preconditioned behaviors
p47
aVthat they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo this brings me to a quieter, small work
p50
aVcalled Handheld.
p51
aVThe viewer sees a piece of paper
p52
aVthat's mounted on the far end of the wall,
p53
aVbut when you go closer, you see that it's a blank
p54
aVA4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,
p55
aVthat's held on either side
p56
aVby two small hands
p57
aVthat appear to be carved with a great deal
p58
aVof attention and care from a small block of wood.
p59
aVThe viewer also sees that this entire sculpture
p60
aVis sort of moving very slightly,
p61
aVas if these two hands are trying
p62
aVto hold the paper very still
p63
aVfor a long period of time,
p64
aVand somehow are not managing to.
p65
aVSo this instability in the movement
p66
aVvery closely resembles the unsteady nature
p67
aVof images seen through a handheld camera.
p68
aVSo here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.
p69
aVOne is through a still camera
p70
aVand the other is through a handheld camera.
p71
aVAnd you immediately see how the unsteady nature
p72
aVof the video suggests the presence
p73
aVof an observer and a subjective point of view.
p74
aVSo we've just removed the camera
p75
aVand transferred that movement onto the panel.
p76
aVSo here's a video.
p77
aVYou have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet.
p78
aVBut to us, we're sort of trying to evoke
p79
aVa self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person
p80
aVwith outstretched arms
p81
aVbehind this enormous piece of paper.
p82
aVThat sort of likens it to the amount of strain
p83
aVto be at the service of the observer and present
p84
aVthis piece of paper very delicately to the viewer
p85
aVin front of them.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe next work is Decoy.
p88
aVThis is a cardboard model, so the object
p89
aVis about as tall as I am.
p90
aVIt has a rounded body, two arms,
p91
aVand a very tall, head-like antenna,
p92
aVand its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
p93
aVSo when a viewer passes by,
p94
aVit sort of tilts from side to side,
p95
aVand moves its arms more and more frantically
p96
aVas the person gets closer.
p97
aVSo here is the first test scenario.
p98
aVYou see the two movements integrated,
p99
aVand the object seems to be employing
p100
aVits entire being in this expression of desperation.
p101
aVBut the idea is that once it's got the person's attention,
p102
aVit's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVSo this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.
p105
aVIt appears to be mass-manufactured
p106
aVlike it came out of a factory
p107
aVlike vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
p108
aVBecause we are always working
p109
aVfrom a very personal space,
p110
aVwe like how this consumer aesthetic
p111
aVsort of depersonalizes the object
p112
aVand gives us a bit of distance
p113
aVin its appearance, at least.
p114
aVAnd so to us this is a kind of sinister being
p115
aVwhich is trying to distract you from the things
p116
aVthat actually need your attention,
p117
aVbut it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
p118
aVThe next work is an object,
p119
aVthat's also a kind of sound instrument.
p120
aVIn the shape of an amphitheater
p121
aVthat's scaled to the size of an audience
p122
aVas perceived from somebody from the stage.
p123
aVSo from where I'm standing,
p124
aVeach of you appears to be this big,
p125
aVand the audience sort of takes the entire
p126
aVfield of my vision.
p127
aVSeated in this audience are 996 small figures.
p128
aVThey're mechanically enabled to clap
p129
aVof their own free will.
p130
aVThis means that each of them can decide
p131
aVif and when they want to clap,
p132
aVhow hard, for how long,
p133
aVhow they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others,
p134
aVand if they want to contribute to innovation.
p135
aVSo when the viewer steps in front of the audience,
p136
aVthere will be a response.
p137
aVIt could be a few claps or a strong applause,
p138
aVand then nothing happens until the viewer
p139
aVleaves the stage, and again the audience will respond.
p140
aVIt could be anything from a few feeble claps
p141
aVfrom members in the audience,
p142
aVor it could be a very loud ovation.
p143
aVSo to us, I think we're really looking
p144
aVat an audience as its own object
p145
aVor its own organism
p146
aVthat's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,
p147
aVan instrument.
p148
aVSo the viewer can play it
p149
aVby eliciting quite complex and varied,
p150
aVnuanced musical or sound patterns,
p151
aVbut cannot really provoke the audience
p152
aVinto any particular kind of response.
p153
aVSo there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness
p154
aVand uneasiness involved.
p155
aVIt also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.
p156
aVSo here if you see we're quite excited about
p157
aVthe image of the head splitting to form the two hands.
p158
aVSo here's a small visual animation,
p159
aVas if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing
p160
aVagainst each other to kind of make sense
p161
aVof the duality and the tension.
p162
aVAnd here is a prototype.
p163
aVSo we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.
p164
aa(lp165
VOkay, this is the last work. It's called the Framerunners.
p166
aVIt comes out of the idea of a window.
p167
aVThis is an actual window in our studio,
p168
aVand as you can see, it's made up of three
p169
aVdifferent thicknesses of wooden sections.
p170
aVSo we used the same window vocabulary
p171
aVto construct our own frame or grid
p172
aVthat's suspended in the room and that can
p173
aVbe viewed from two sides.
p174
aVThis grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.
p175
aVThey're also made up of three different sizes,
p176
aVas if to suggest a kind of perspective
p177
aVor landscape on the single plain.
p178
aVEach of these figures can also run backward
p179
aVand forward in the track
p180
aVand hide behind two adjacent tracks.
p181
aVSo in contrast to this very tight grid,
p182
aVwe wanted to give these figures a very comical
p183
aVand slapstick-like quality,
p184
aVas if a puppeteer has taken them
p185
aVand physically animated them down the path.
p186
aVSo we like the idea of these figures
p187
aVsort of skipping along
p188
aVlike they're oblivious and carefree
p189
aVand happy-go-lucky and content,
p190
aVuntil they sort of sense a movement from the viewer
p191
aVand they will hide behind the fastest wall.
p192
aVSo to us, this work also presents its own contradiction.
p193
aVThese figures are sort of entrapped
p194
aVwithin this very strong grid,
p195
aVwhich is like a prison, but also a fortress,
p196
aVbecause it allows them to be oblivious
p197
aVand naive and carefree and quite oblivious
p198
aVof the external world.
p199
aVSo all these real life qualities that I talk about
p200
aVare sort of translated to a very specific
p201
aVtechnical configuration,
p202
aVand we were very lucky to collaborate
p203
aVwith ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.
p204
aVSo you see they extracted the motion cogs
p205
aVfrom our animations and created a wiggle
p206
aVthat integrated the head-bobbing movement
p207
aVand the back-and-forth movement.
p208
aVSo it's really quite small.
p209
aVYou can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.
p210
aVSo imagine our excitement when we saw it
p211
aVreally working in the studio, and here it is.
