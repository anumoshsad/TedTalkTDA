VWe have a global health challenge
p4
aVin our hands today,
p5
aVand that is that the way we currently
p6
aVdiscover and develop new drugs
p7
aVis too costly, takes far too long,
p8
aVand it fails more often than it succeeds.
p9
aVIt really just isn't working, and that means
p10
aVthat patients that badly need new therapies
p11
aVare not getting them,
p12
aVand diseases are going untreated.
p13
aVWe seem to be spending more and more money.
p14
aVSo for every billion dollars we spend in R&D,
p15
aVwe're getting less drugs approved into the market.
p16
aVMore money, less drugs. Hmm.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo what's going on here?
p19
aVWell, there's a multitude of factors at play,
p20
aVbut I think one of the key factors
p21
aVis that the tools that we currently have
p22
aVavailable to test whether a drug is going to work,
p23
aVwhether it has efficacy,
p24
aVor whether it's going to be safe
p25
aVbefore we get it into human clinical trials,
p26
aVare failing us. They're not predicting
p27
aVwhat's going to happen in humans.
p28
aVAnd we have two main tools available
p29
aVat our disposal.
p30
aVThey are cells in dishes and animal testing.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.
p33
aVSo, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.
p34
aVWe take them and rip them out
p35
aVof their native environment, throw them in one of these dishes,
p36
aVand expect them to work.
p37
aVGuess what. They don't.
p38
aVThey don't like that environment
p39
aVbecause it's nothing like
p40
aVwhat they have in the body.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhat about animal testing?
p43
aVWell, animals do and can provide
p44
aVextremely useful information.
p45
aVThey teach us about what happens
p46
aVin the complex organism.
p47
aVWe learn more about the biology itself.
p48
aVHowever, more often than not,
p49
aVanimal models fail to predict what will happen in humans
p50
aVwhen they're treated with a particular drug.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo we need better tools.
p53
aVWe need human cells,
p54
aVbut we need to find a way to keep them happy
p55
aVoutside the body.
p56
aa(lp57
VOur bodies are dynamic environments.
p58
aVWe're in constant motion.
p59
aVOur cells experience that.
p60
aVThey're in dynamic environments in our body.
p61
aVThey're under constant mechanical forces.
p62
aVSo if we want to make cells happy
p63
aVoutside our bodies,
p64
aVwe need to become cell architects.
p65
aVWe need to design, build and engineer
p66
aVa home away from home for the cells.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd at the Wyss Institute,
p69
aVwe've done just that.
p70
aVWe call it an organ-on-a-chip.
p71
aVAnd I have one right here.
p72
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible.
p73
aVRight here in my hand is a breathing, living
p74
aVhuman lung on a chip.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd it's not just beautiful.
p77
aVIt can do a tremendous amount of things.
p78
aVWe have living cells in that little chip,
p79
aVcells that are in a dynamic environment
p80
aVinteracting with different cell types.
p81
aVThere's been many people
p82
aVtrying to grow cells in the lab.
p83
aVThey've tried many different approaches.
p84
aVThey've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab.
p85
aVWe're not trying to do that here.
p86
aVWe're simply trying to recreate
p87
aVin this tiny chip
p88
aVthe smallest functional unit
p89
aVthat represents the biochemistry,
p90
aVthe function and the mechanical strain
p91
aVthat the cells experience in our bodies.
p92
aVSo how does it work? Let me show you.
p93
aVWe use techniques from the computer chip
p94
aVmanufacturing industry
p95
aVto make these structures at a scale
p96
aVrelevant to both the cells and their environment.
p97
aVWe have three fluidic channels.
p98
aVIn the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane
p99
aVon which we can add human cells
p100
aVfrom, say, our lungs,
p101
aVand then underneath, they had capillary cells,
p102
aVthe cells in our blood vessels.
p103
aVAnd we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip
p104
aVthat stretch and contract the membrane,
p105
aVso the cells experience the same mechanical forces
p106
aVthat they did when we breathe.
p107
aVAnd they experience them how they did in the body.
p108
aVThere's air flowing through the top channel,
p109
aVand then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients
p110
aVthrough the blood channel.
p111
aVNow the chip is really beautiful,
p112
aVbut what can we do with it?
p113
aVWe can get incredible functionality
p114
aVinside these little chips.
p115
aVLet me show you.
p116
aVWe could, for example, mimic infection,
p117
aVwhere we add bacterial cells into the lung.
p118
aVthen we can add human white blood cells.
p119
aVWhite blood cells are our body's defense
p120
aVagainst bacterial invaders,
p121
aVand when they sense this inflammation due to infection,
p122
aVthey will enter from the blood into the lung
p123
aVand engulf the bacteria.
p124
aVWell now you're going to see this happening
p125
aVlive in an actual human lung on a chip.
p126
aVWe've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through,
p127
aVand when they detect that infection,
p128
aVthey begin to stick.
p129
aVThey stick, and then they try to go into the lung
p130
aVside from blood channel.
p131
aVAnd you can see here, we can actually visualize
p132
aVa single white blood cell.
p133
aVIt sticks, it wiggles its way through
p134
aVbetween the cell layers, through the pore,
p135
aVcomes out on the other side of the membrane,
p136
aVand right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria
p137
aVlabeled in green.
p138
aVIn that tiny chip, you just witnessed
p139
aVone of the most fundamental responses
p140
aVour body has to an infection.
p141
aVIt's the way we respond to \u2014 an immune response.
p142
aVIt's pretty exciting.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow I want to share this picture with you,
p145
aVnot just because it's so beautiful,
p146
aVbut because it tells us an enormous amount of information
p147
aVabout what the cells are doing within the chips.
p148
aVIt tells us that these cells
p149
aVfrom the small airways in our lungs,
p150
aVactually have these hairlike structures
p151
aVthat you would expect to see in the lung.
p152
aVThese structures are called cilia,
p153
aVand they actually move the mucus out of the lung.
p154
aVYeah. Mucus. Yuck.
p155
aVBut mucus is actually very important.
p156
aVMucus traps particulates, viruses,
p157
aVpotential allergens,
p158
aVand these little cilia move
p159
aVand clear the mucus out.
p160
aVWhen they get damaged, say,
p161
aVby cigarette smoke for example,
p162
aVthey don't work properly, and they can't clear that mucus out.
p163
aVAnd that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.
p164
aVCilia and the clearance of mucus
p165
aVare also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.
p166
aVBut now, with the functionality that we get in these chips,
p167
aVwe can begin to look
p168
aVfor potential new treatments.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe didn't stop with the lung on a chip.
p171
aVWe have a gut on a chip.
p172
aVYou can see one right here.
p173
aVAnd we've put intestinal human cells
p174
aVin a gut on a chip,
p175
aVand they're under constant peristaltic motion,
p176
aVthis trickling flow through the cells,
p177
aVand we can mimic many of the functions
p178
aVthat you actually would expect to see
p179
aVin the human intestine.
p180
aVNow we can begin to create models of diseases
p181
aVsuch as irritable bowel syndrome.
p182
aVThis is a disease that affects
p183
aVa large number of individuals.
p184
aVIt's really debilitating,
p185
aVand there aren't really many good treatments for it.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow we have a whole pipeline
p188
aVof different organ chips
p189
aVthat we are currently working on in our labs.
p190
aVNow, the true power of this technology, however,
p191
aVreally comes from the fact
p192
aVthat we can fluidically link them.
p193
aVThere's fluid flowing across these cells,
p194
aVso we can begin to interconnect
p195
aVmultiple different chips together
p196
aVto form what we call a virtual human on a chip.
p197
aVNow we're really getting excited.
p198
aVWe're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips,
p199
aVbut what our goal is is to be able to recreate
p200
aVsufficient functionality
p201
aVso that we can make better predictions
p202
aVof what's going to happen in humans.
p203
aVFor example, now we can begin to explore
p204
aVwhat happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug.
p205
aVThose of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler,
p206
aVwe can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,
p207
aVhow it enters the body,
p208
aVhow it might affect, say, your heart.
p209
aVDoes it change the beating of your heart?
p210
aVDoes it have a toxicity?
p211
aVDoes it get cleared by the liver?
p212
aVIs it metabolized in the liver?
p213
aVIs it excreted in your kidneys?
p214
aVWe can begin to study the dynamic
p215
aVresponse of the body to a drug.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis could really revolutionize
p218
aVand be a game changer
p219
aVfor not only the pharmaceutical industry,
p220
aVbut a whole host of different industries,
p221
aVincluding the cosmetics industry.
p222
aVWe can potentially use the skin on a chip
p223
aVthat we're currently developing in the lab
p224
aVto test whether the ingredients in those products
p225
aVthat you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin
p226
aVwithout the need for animal testing.
p227
aVWe could test the safety
p228
aVof chemicals that we are exposed to
p229
aVon a daily basis in our environment,
p230
aVsuch as chemicals in regular household cleaners.
p231
aVWe could also use the organs on chips
p232
aVfor applications in bioterrorism
p233
aVor radiation exposure.
p234
aVWe could use them to learn more about
p235
aVdiseases such as ebola
p236
aVor other deadly diseases such as SARS.
p237
aa(lp238
VOrgans on chips could also change
p239
aVthe way we do clinical trials in the future.
p240
aVRight now, the average participant
p241
aVin a clinical trial is that: average.
p242
aVTends to be middle aged, tends to be female.
p243
aVYou won't find many clinical trials
p244
aVin which children are involved,
p245
aVyet every day, we give children medications,
p246
aVand the only safety data we have on that drug
p247
aVis one that we obtained from adults.
p248
aVChildren are not adults.
p249
aVThey may not respond in the same way adults do.
p250
aVThere are other things like genetic differences
p251
aVin populations
p252
aVthat may lead to at-risk populations
p253
aVthat are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.
p254
aVNow imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations,
p255
aVput them on chips,
p256
aVand create populations on a chip.
p257
aVThis could really change the way
p258
aVwe do clinical trials.
p259
aVAnd this is the team and the people that are doing this.
p260
aVWe have engineers, we have cell biologists,
p261
aVwe have clinicians, all working together.
p262
aVWe're really seeing something quite incredible
p263
aVat the Wyss Institute.
p264
aVIt's really a convergence of disciplines,
p265
aVwhere biology is influencing the way we design,
p266
aVthe way we engineer, the way we build.
p267
aVIt's pretty exciting.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe're establishing important industry collaborations
p270
aVsuch as the one we have with a company
p271
aVthat has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing.
p272
aVThey're going to help us make,
p273
aVinstead of one of these,
p274
aVmillions of these chips,
p275
aVso that we can get them into the hands
p276
aVof as many researchers as possible.
p277
aVAnd this is key to the potential of that technology.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow let me show you our instrument.
p280
aVThis is an instrument that our engineers
p281
aVare actually prototyping right now in the lab,
p282
aVand this instrument is going to give us
p283
aVthe engineering controls that we're going to require
p284
aVin order to link 10 or more organ chips together.
p285
aVIt does something else that's very important.
p286
aVIt creates an easy user interface.
p287
aVSo a cell biologist like me can come in,
p288
aVtake a chip, put it in a cartridge
p289
aVlike the prototype you see there,
p290
aVput the cartridge into the machine
p291
aVjust like you would a C.D.,
p292
aVand away you go.
p293
aVPlug and play. Easy.
p294
aa(lp295
VNow, let's imagine a little bit
p296
aVwhat the future might look like
p297
aVif I could take your stem cells
p298
aVand put them on a chip,
p299
aVor your stem cells and put them on a chip.
p300
aVIt would be a personalized chip just for you.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow all of us in here are individuals,
p303
aVand those individual differences mean
p304
aVthat we could react very differently
p305
aVand sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.
p306
aVI myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache,
p307
aVjust couldn't shake it, thought,  "Well, I'll try something different."
p308
aVI took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,
p309
aVI was on my way to the emergency room
p310
aVwith a full-blown asthma attack.
p311
aVNow, obviously it wasn't fatal,
p312
aVbut unfortunately, some of these
p313
aVadverse drug reactions can be fatal.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo how do we prevent them?
p316
aVWell, we could imagine one day
p317
aVhaving Geraldine on a chip,
p318
aVhaving Danielle on a chip,
p319
aVhaving you on a chip.
p320
aa(lp321
