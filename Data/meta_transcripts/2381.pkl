VNow...
p4
aVlet's go back in time.
p5
aVIt's 1974.
p6
aVThere is the gallery somewhere
p7
aVin the world,
p8
aVand there is a young girl, age 23,
p9
aVstanding in the middle of the space.
p10
aVIn the front of her is a table.
p11
aVOn the table there are 76 objects
p12
aVfor pleasure and for pain.
p13
aVSome of the objects are
p14
aVa glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.
p15
aVBut also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer
p16
aVand the pistol with one bullet.
p17
aVThere are instructions which say,
p18
aV"I'm an object.
p19
aVYou can use everything on the table on me.
p20
aVI'm taking all responsibility \u2014 even killing me.
p21
aVAnd the time is six hours."
p22
aa(lp23
VThe beginning of this performance was easy.
p24
aVPeople would give me the glass of water to drink,
p25
aVthey'd give me the rose.
p26
aVBut very soon after,
p27
aVthere was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes,
p28
aVand then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach.
p29
aVSomebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood,
p30
aVand I still have the scar.
p31
aVThe women would tell the men what to do.
p32
aVAnd the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening,
p33
aVand it was all public,
p34
aVand they were with their wives.
p35
aVThey carried me around and put me on the table,
p36
aVand put the knife between my legs.
p37
aVAnd somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple.
p38
aVAnd another person took the pistol and they started a fight.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd after six hours were finished,
p41
aVI...
p42
aVstarted walking towards the public.
p43
aVI was a mess.
p44
aVI was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face.
p45
aVAnd everybody escaped, they just ran away.
p46
aVThey could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being.
p47
aVAnd then \u2014
p48
aVwhat happened
p49
aVis I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning.
p50
aVAnd
p51
aVI looked at myself in the mirror,
p52
aVand I had a piece of gray hair.
p53
aVAlright \u2014
p54
aVplease take off your blindfolds.
p55
aa(lp56
VWelcome to the performance world.
p57
aVFirst of all, let's explain what the performance is.
p58
aVSo many artists, so many different explanations,
p59
aVbut my explanation for performance is very simple.
p60
aVPerformance is a mental and physical construction
p61
aVthat the performer makes in a specific time
p62
aVin a space in front of an audience
p63
aVand then energy dialogue happens.
p64
aVThe audience and the performer make the piece together.
p65
aVAnd the difference between performance and theater is huge.
p66
aVIn the theater, the knife is not a knife
p67
aVand the blood is just ketchup.
p68
aVIn the performance, the blood is the material,
p69
aVand the razor blade or knife is the tool.
p70
aVIt's all about being there in the real time,
p71
aVand you can't rehearse performance,
p72
aVbecause you can't do many of these types of things twice \u2014 ever.
p73
aVWhich is very important, the performance is \u2014
p74
aVyou know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things.
p75
aVWe're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain,
p76
aVwe're afraid of mortality.
p77
aVSo what I'm doing \u2014
p78
aVI'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience.
p79
aVI'm using your energy,
p80
aVand with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can.
p81
aVAnd then I liberate myself from these fears.
p82
aVAnd I'm your mirror.
p83
aVIf I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.
p84
aa(lp85
VAfter Belgrade, where I was born,
p86
aVI went to Amsterdam.
p87
aVAnd you know, I've been doing performances
p88
aVsince the last 40 years.
p89
aVAnd here I met Ulay,
p90
aVand he was the person I actually fell in love with.
p91
aVAnd we made, for 12 years, performances together.
p92
aVYou know the knife and the pistols and the bullets,
p93
aVI exchange into love and trust.
p94
aVSo to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely
p95
aVbecause this arrow is pointing to my heart.
p96
aVSo, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on,
p97
aVis about trust, is about total trust to another human being.
p98
aa(lp99
VOur relationship was 12 years,
p100
aVand we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy.
p101
aVAnd as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too.
p102
aVWe didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do
p103
aVand say, you know, "This is over."
p104
aVWe walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye.
p105
aVI started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert.
p106
aVWe walked, each of us, three months,
p107
aVtwo and a half thousand kilometers.
p108
aVIt was the mountains, it was difficult.
p109
aVIt was climbing, it was ruins.
p110
aVIt was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces,
p111
aVthis was before China was open in '87.
p112
aVAnd we succeeded to meet in the middle
p113
aVto say goodbye.
p114
aVAnd then our relationship stopped.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd now, it completely changed how I see the public.
p117
aVAnd one very important piece I made in those days
p118
aVwas "Balkan Baroque."
p119
aVAnd this was the time of the Balkan Wars,
p120
aVand I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image,
p121
aVsomething that could serve for any war at any time,
p122
aVbecause the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere.
p123
aVSo here I am washing
p124
aVtwo and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones.
p125
aVYou can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars.
p126
aVSo I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones,
p127
aVand becoming possible \u2014 an unbearable smell.
p128
aVBut then something stays in the memory.
p129
aa(lp130
VI want to show you the one who really changed my life,
p131
aVand this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made.
p132
aVThis performance \u2014 when I said to the curator,
p133
aV"I'm just going to sit at the chair,
p134
aVand there will be an empty chair at the front,
p135
aVand anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want."
p136
aVThe curator said to me,
p137
aV"That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York,
p138
aVthis chair will be empty,
p139
aVnobody has time to sit in front of you."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VBut I sit for three months.
p144
aVAnd I sit everyday, eight hours \u2014
p145
aVthe opening of the museum \u2014
p146
aVand 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours,
p147
aVand I never move.
p148
aVAnd I removed the table and I'm still sitting,
p149
aVand this changed everything.
p150
aVThis performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago \u2014
p151
aVnothing would have happened.
p152
aVBut the need of people to actually experience something different,
p153
aVthe public was not anymore the group \u2014
p154
aVrelation was one to one.
p155
aVI was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me,
p156
aVbut they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours
p157
aVto get to this position,
p158
aVand finally, they sit.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd what happened?
p161
aVThey are observed by the other people,
p162
aVthey're photographed, they're filmed by the camera,
p163
aVthey're observed by me
p164
aVand they have nowhere to escape except in themselves.
p165
aVAnd that makes a difference.
p166
aVThere was so much pain and loneliness,
p167
aVthere's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes,
p168
aVbecause in the gaze with that total stranger,
p169
aVthat you never even say one word \u2014 everything happened.
p170
aVAnd I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months,
p171
aVI am not the same anymore.
p172
aVAnd I understood that I have a very strong mission,
p173
aVthat I have to communicate this experience
p174
aVto everybody.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd this is how, for me, was born the idea
p177
aVto have an institute of immaterial performing arts.
p178
aVBecause thinking about immateriality,
p179
aVperformance is time-based art.
p180
aVIt's not like a painting.
p181
aVYou have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there.
p182
aVPerformance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory,
p183
aVor the story of somebody else telling you,
p184
aVbut you actually missed the whole thing.
p185
aVSo you have to be there.
p186
aVAnd in my point, if you talk about immaterial art,
p187
aVmusic is the highest \u2014 absolutely highest art of all,
p188
aVbecause it's the most immaterial.
p189
aVAnd then after this is performance, and then everything else.
p190
aVThat's my subjective way.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York,
p193
aVand we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.
p194
aVAnd it's very simple.
p195
aVIf you want to get experience, you have to give me your time.
p196
aVYou have to sign the contract before you enter the building,
p197
aVthat you will spend there a full six hours,
p198
aVyou have to give me your word of honor.
p199
aVIt's something so old-fashioned,
p200
aVbut if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before \u2014
p201
aVthat's not my problem.
p202
aVBut it's six hours, the experience.
p203
aVAnd then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment,
p204
aVso get home and frame it if you want.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is orientation hall.
p209
aVThe public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats.
p210
aVIt's this importance
p211
aVof stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter.
p212
aVAnd then you go to the lockers
p213
aVand you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer
p214
aVand everything digital, electronic.
p215
aVAnd you are getting free time for yourself for the first time.
p216
aVBecause there is nothing wrong with technology,
p217
aVour approach to technology is wrong.
p218
aVWe are losing the time we have for ourselves.
p219
aVThis is an institute to actually give you back this time.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo what you do here,
p222
aVfirst you start slow walking, you start slowing down.
p223
aVYou're going back to simplicity.
p224
aVAfter slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water \u2014
p225
aVvery simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour.
p226
aVAfter this, you're going to the magnet chamber,
p227
aVwhere you're going to create some magnet streams on your body.
p228
aVThen after this, you go to crystal chamber.
p229
aVAfter crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber,
p230
aVafter eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down.
p231
aVSo it's the three basic positions of the human body,
p232
aVsitting, standing and lying.
p233
aVAnd slow walking.
p234
aVAnd there is a sound chamber.
p235
aVAnd then after you've seen all of this,
p236
aVand prepared yourself mentally and physically,
p237
aVthen you are ready to see something with a long duration,
p238
aVlike in immaterial art.
p239
aVIt can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece,
p240
aVit can be film, it can be video dance.
p241
aVYou go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable.
p242
aVIn the long duration chairs,
p243
aVyou're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work.
p244
aVAnd if you fall asleep,
p245
aVwhich is very possible because it's been a long day,
p246
aVyou're going to be transported to the parking lot.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd you know, sleeping is very important.
p251
aVIn sleeping, you're still receiving art.
p252
aVSo in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time,
p253
aVand then after this you just, you know, go back,
p254
aVyou see more of the things you like to see
p255
aVor go home with your certificate.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo this institute right now is virtual.
p258
aVRight now, I am just making my institute in Brazil,
p259
aVthen it's going to be in Australia,
p260
aVthen it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere.
p261
aVAnd this is to experience a kind of simple method,
p262
aVhow you go back to simplicity in your own life.
p263
aVCounting rice will be another thing.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VYou know, if you count rice you can make life, too.
p268
aVHow to count rice for six hours?
p269
aVIt's incredibly important.
p270
aVYou know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry,
p271
aVbeing completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting.
p272
aVAnd then this unbelievable amount of peace you get
p273
aVwhen satisfying work is finished \u2014
p274
aVor counting sand in the desert.
p275
aVOr having the sound-isolated situation \u2014
p276
aVthat you have headphones, that you don't hear anything,
p277
aVand you're just there together without sound,
p278
aVwith the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.
p279
aa(lp280
VWe are always doing things we like in our life.
p281
aVAnd this is why you're not changing.
p282
aVYou do things in life \u2014
p283
aVit's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way.
p284
aVBut my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear,
p285
aVthe things I don't know,
p286
aVto go to territory that nobody's ever been.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd then also to include the failure.
p289
aVI think failure is important
p290
aVbecause if you go, if you experiment, you can fail.
p291
aVIf you don't go into that area and you don't fail,
p292
aVyou are actually repeating yourself over and over again.
p293
aVAnd I think that human beings right now need a change,
p294
aVand the only change to be made is a personal level change.
p295
aVYou have to make the change on yourself.
p296
aVBecause the only way to change consciousness
p297
aVand to change the world around us,
p298
aVis to start with yourself.
p299
aVIt's so easy to criticize how it's different,
p300
aVthe things in the world and they're not right,
p301
aVand the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world
p302
aVand there's wars \u2014 the killing.
p303
aVBut what we do on the personal level \u2014
p304
aVwhat is our contribution to this whole thing?
p305
aa(lp306
VCan you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know,
p307
aVand look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?
p308
aa(lp309
V(Chatter)
p310
aa(lp311
VI'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little.
p312
aVBreathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious.
p313
aVBe relaxed.
p314
aVAnd just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Silence)
p317
aVThank you for trusting me.
p318
aa(lp319
