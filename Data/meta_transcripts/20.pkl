VI think I was supposed to talk about my new book,
p4
aVwhich is called "Blink,"
p5
aVand it's about snap judgments and first impressions.
p6
aVAnd it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut I was thinking about this,
p11
aVand I realized that although my new book makes me happy,
p12
aVand I think would make my mother happy,
p13
aVit's not really about happiness.
p14
aVSo I decided instead, I would talk about someone
p15
aVwho I think has done as much to make Americans happy
p16
aVas perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,
p17
aVa man who is a great personal hero of mine:
p18
aVsomeone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
p19
aVwho is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.
p20
aa(lp21
VHoward's about this high, and he's round,
p22
aVand he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses
p23
aVand thinning gray hair,
p24
aVand he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,
p25
aVand he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,
p26
aVand he's a great aficionado of medieval history.
p27
aVAnd by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
p28
aVNow, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,
p29
aValthough at some point in my life,
p30
aVI dated a girl for two years
p31
aVwho was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.
p32
aVWhich should tell you something about that relationship.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAs far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.
p37
aVAnd Howard is very interested in measuring things.
p38
aVAnd he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,
p39
aVand he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.
p40
aVAnd one of his first clients was Pepsi.
p41
aVThis is many years ago, back in the early 70s.
p42
aVAnd Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
p43
aV"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame,
p44
aVand we would like to make Diet Pepsi.
p45
aVWe'd like you to figure out
p46
aVhow much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi
p47
aVin order to have the perfect drink."
p48
aVNow that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,
p49
aVand that's what Howard thought.
p50
aVBecause Pepsi told him,
p51
aV"We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.
p52
aVAnything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;
p53
aVanything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.
p54
aVWe want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?"
p55
aVNow, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.
p56
aVWhat we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
p57
aVat every degree of sweetness \u2014 eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
p58
aVall the way up to 12 \u2014
p59
aVand we try this out with thousands of people,
p60
aVand we plot the results on a curve,
p61
aVand we take the most popular concentration, right?
p62
aVReally simple.
p63
aa(lp64
VHoward does the experiment, and he gets the data back,
p65
aVand he plots it on a curve,
p66
aVand all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.
p67
aVIn fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
p68
aVIt's a mess. It's all over the place.
p69
aVNow, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,
p70
aVare not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.
p71
aVThey think, "Well, you know,
p72
aVfiguring out what people think about cola's not that easy."
p73
aV"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way."
p74
aV"You know, let's just make an educated guess,"
p75
aVand they simply point and they go for 10 percent,
p76
aVright in the middle.
p77
aVHoward is not so easily placated.
p78
aVHoward is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.
p79
aVAnd this was not good enough for him,
p80
aVand this question bedeviled him for years.
p81
aVAnd he would think it through and say, "What was wrong?
p82
aVWhy could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,
p85
aVabout to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé.
p86
aVAnd suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.
p87
aVAnd that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,
p88
aVthey were asking the wrong question.
p89
aVThey were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
p90
aVand they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.
p91
aVTrust me.
p92
aVThis was an enormous revelation.
p93
aVThis was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.
p94
aVHoward immediately went on the road,
p95
aVand he would go to conferences around the country,
p96
aVand he would stand up and say,
p97
aV"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi.
p98
aVYou're wrong.
p99
aVYou should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."
p100
aVAnd people would look at him blankly and say,
p101
aV"What are you talking about? Craziness."
p102
aVAnd they would say, "Move! Next!"
p103
aVTried to get business, nobody would hire him \u2014
p104
aVhe was obsessed, though,
p105
aVand he talked about it and talked about it.
p106
aVHoward loves the Yiddish expression
p107
aV"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."
p108
aVThis was his horseradish.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VHe was obsessed with it!
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd finally, he had a breakthrough.
p115
aVVlasic Pickles came to him,
p116
aVand they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle."
p117
aVAnd he said,
p118
aV"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."
p119
aVAnd he came back to them and he said,
p120
aV"You don't just need to improve your regular;
p121
aVyou need to create zesty."
p122
aVAnd that's where we got zesty pickles.
p123
aVThen the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup.
p124
aVAnd this was even more important.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.
p127
aVCampbell's made Prego,
p128
aVand Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù,
p129
aVwhich was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.
p130
aVIn the industry \u2014 I don't know whether you care about this,
p131
aVor how much time I have to go into this.
p132
aVBut it was, technically speaking \u2014 this is an aside \u2014
p133
aVPrego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.
p134
aVThe quality of the tomato paste is much better;
p135
aVthe spice mix is far superior;
p136
aVit adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.
p137
aVIn fact, they would do the famous bowl test
p138
aVback in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.
p139
aVYou'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?
p140
aVAnd the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.
p141
aVThat's called "adherence."
p142
aVAnd, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,
p143
aVand the quality of their tomato paste,
p144
aVPrego was struggling.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.
p147
aVAnd Howard looked at their product line, and he said,
p148
aVwhat you have is a dead tomato society.
p149
aVSo he said, this is what I want to do.
p150
aVAnd he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,
p151
aVand he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.
p152
aVAnd he varied them according to every conceivable way
p153
aVthat you can vary tomato sauce:
p154
aVby sweetness, by level of garlic,
p155
aVby tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness,
p156
aVby visible solids \u2014
p157
aVmy favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VEvery conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce,
p162
aVhe varied spaghetti sauce.
p163
aVAnd then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces,
p164
aVand he went on the road.
p165
aVHe went to New York, to Chicago,
p166
aVhe went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.
p167
aVAnd he brought in people by the truckload into big halls.
p168
aVAnd he sat them down for two hours,
p169
aVand over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.
p170
aVTen small bowls of pasta,
p171
aVwith a different spaghetti sauce on each one.
p172
aVAnd after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,
p173
aVhow good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.
p174
aa(lp175
VAt the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,
p176
aVhe had a mountain of data
p177
aVabout how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.
p178
aVAnd then he analyzed the data.
p179
aVDid he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce?
p180
aVNo! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.
p181
aVInstead, he looked at the data, and he said,
p182
aVlet's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.
p183
aVLet's see if they congregate around certain ideas.
p184
aVAnd sure enough, if you sit down,
p185
aVand you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,
p186
aVyou realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
p187
aVThere are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
p188
aVthere are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;
p189
aVand there are people who like it extra chunky.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,
p192
aVbecause at the time, in the early 1980s,
p193
aVif you went to a supermarket,
p194
aVyou would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
p195
aVAnd Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
p196
aV"You're telling me that one third of Americans
p197
aVcrave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce
p198
aVand yet no one is servicing their needs?"
p199
aVAnd he said "Yes!"
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd Prego then went back,
p204
aVand completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,
p205
aVand came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely
p206
aVtook over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.
p207
aVAnd over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars
p208
aVoff their line of extra-chunky sauces.
p209
aa(lp210
VEveryone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,
p211
aV"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"
p212
aVAnd that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,
p213
aVand 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil.
p214
aVAnd then eventually even Ragù hired Howard,
p215
aVand Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego.
p216
aVAnd today, if you go to a really good supermarket,
p217
aVdo you know how many Ragùs there are?
p218
aV36!
p219
aVIn six varieties:
p220
aVCheese, Light,
p221
aVRobusto, Rich & Hearty,
p222
aVOld World Traditional \u2014
p223
aVExtra-Chunky Garden.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VThat's Howard's doing.
p228
aVThat is Howard's gift to the American people.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow why is that important?
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VIt is, in fact, enormously important.
p235
aVI'll explain to you why.
p236
aVWhat Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks
p237
aVabout making you happy.
p238
aVAssumption number one in the food industry used to be
p239
aVthat the way to find out what people want to eat,
p240
aVwhat will make people happy, is to ask them.
p241
aVAnd for years and years and years,
p242
aVRagù and Prego would have focus groups,
p243
aVand they would sit you down, and they would say,
p244
aV"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?
p245
aVTell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."
p246
aVAnd for all those years \u2014 20, 30 years \u2014
p247
aVthrough all those focus group sessions,
p248
aVno one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
p249
aVEven though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VPeople don't know what they want!
p254
aVAs Howard loves to say,
p255
aV"The mind knows not what the tongue wants."
p256
aVIt's a mystery!
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd a critically important step
p261
aVin understanding our own desires and tastes
p262
aVis to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.
p263
aVIf I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,
p264
aVyou know what you'd say?
p265
aVEvery one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."
p266
aVIt's what people always say when you ask them.
p267
aV"What do you like?" "Dark, rich, hearty roast!"
p268
aVWhat percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?
p269
aVAccording to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.
p270
aVMost of you like milky, weak coffee.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VBut you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want
p275
aVthat "I want a milky, weak coffee."
p276
aa(lp277
VSo that's number one thing that Howard did.
p278
aVNumber two thing that Howard did is he made us realize \u2014
p279
aVit's another very critical point \u2014
p280
aVhe made us realize the importance
p281
aVof what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."
p282
aVWhy is this critical?
p283
aVBecause this is the way the food industry thought before Howard.
p284
aVWhat were they obsessed with in the early 80s?
p285
aVThey were obsessed with mustard.
p286
aVIn particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.
p287
aVUsed to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's.
p288
aVWhat were they? Yellow mustard.
p289
aVWhat's in it?
p290
aVYellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika.
p291
aVThat was mustard.
p292
aVGrey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.
p293
aVRight?
p294
aVMuch more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,
p295
aVmuch more delicate aromatics.
p296
aVAnd what do they do?
p297
aVThey put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,
p298
aVmade it look French,
p299
aVeven though it's made in Oxnard, California.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,
p304
aVthe way that French's and Gulden's did,
p305
aVthey decided to charge four dollars.
p306
aVAnd they had those ads.
p307
aVWith the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.
p308
aVAnother pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?"
p309
aVAnd the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!
p310
aVTakes over the mustard business!
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd everyone's take-home lesson from that
p313
aVwas that the way to make people happy
p314
aVis to give them something that is more expensive,
p315
aVsomething to aspire to.
p316
aVIt's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,
p317
aVand reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VA better mustard! A more expensive mustard!
p322
aVA mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.
p323
aVAnd Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!"
p324
aVMustard does not exist on a hierarchy.
p325
aVMustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.
p326
aVThere is no good mustard or bad mustard.
p327
aVThere is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
p328
aVThere are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.
p329
aVHe fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.
p330
aVAnd for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.
p331
aa(lp332
VThird thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,
p333
aVis Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VWhat do I mean by that?
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VFor the longest time in the food industry,
p342
aVthere was a sense that there was one way,
p343
aVa perfect way, to make a dish.
p344
aVYou go to Chez Panisse,
p345
aVthey give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds
p346
aVin a something something reduction.
p347
aVThey don't give you five options on the reduction.
p348
aVThey don't say, "Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"
p349
aVNo!
p350
aVYou just get the reduction. Why?
p351
aVBecause the chef at Chez Panisse
p352
aVhas a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.
p353
aV"This is the way it ought to be."
p354
aVAnd she serves it that way time and time again,
p355
aVand if you quarrel with her, she will say,
p356
aV"You know what? You're wrong!
p357
aVThis is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."
p358
aa(lp359
VNow that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.
p360
aVThey had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was.
p361
aVAnd where did that come from? It came from Italy.
p362
aVItalian tomato sauce is what?
p363
aVIt's blended; it's thin.
p364
aVThe culture of tomato sauce was thin.
p365
aVWhen we talked about "authentic tomato sauce" in the 1970s,
p366
aVwe talked about Italian tomato sauce,
p367
aVwe talked about the earliest Ragùs,
p368
aVwhich had no visible solids, right?
p369
aVWhich were thin, you just put a little bit
p370
aVand it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.
p371
aVThat's what it was.
p372
aVAnd why were we attached to that?
p373
aVBecause we thought that what it took to make people happy
p374
aVwas to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
p375
aVAnd B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,
p376
aVthen they would embrace it.
p377
aVAnd that's what would please the maximum number of people.
p378
aa(lp379
VIn other words,
p380
aVpeople in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.
p381
aVThey were looking for one way to treat all of us.
p382
aVAnd it's good reason for them to be obsessed
p383
aVwith the idea of universals,
p384
aVbecause all of science,
p385
aVthrough the 19th century and much of the 20th,
p386
aVwas obsessed with universals.
p387
aVPsychologists, medical scientists, economists
p388
aVwere all interested in finding out the rules
p389
aVthat govern the way all of us behave.
p390
aVBut that changed, right?
p391
aVWhat is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?
p392
aVIt is the movement from the search for universals
p393
aVto the understanding of variability.
p394
aVNow in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily,
p395
aVjust how cancer works,
p396
aVwe want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.
p397
aVI guess my cancer different from your cancer.
p398
aVGenetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.
p399
aVWhat Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying,
p400
aV"This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce."
p401
aVAnd for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.
p402
aa(lp403
VI'll give you one last illustration of variability,
p404
aVand that is \u2014 oh, I'm sorry.
p405
aVHoward not only believed that, but he took it a second step,
p406
aVwhich was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,
p407
aVwe aren't just making an error;
p408
aVwe are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.
p409
aVAnd the example he used was coffee.
p410
aVAnd coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé.
p411
aVIf I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee \u2014
p412
aVa type of coffee, a brew \u2014 that made all of you happy,
p413
aVand then I asked you to rate that coffee,
p414
aVthe average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.
p415
aVIf, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,
p416
aVmaybe three or four coffee clusters,
p417
aVand I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,
p418
aVyour scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
p419
aVThe difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78
p420
aVis a difference between coffee that makes you wince,
p421
aVand coffee that makes you deliriously happy.
p422
aa(lp423
VThat is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson,
p424
aVof Howard Moskowitz:
p425
aVthat in embracing the diversity of human beings,
p426
aVwe will find a surer way to true happiness.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you.
