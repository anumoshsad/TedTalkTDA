VThis meeting has really been about a digital revolution,
p4
aVbut I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.
p5
aVWe've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.
p6
aVAnd I'd like to look after that,
p7
aVto look what comes after the digital revolution.
p8
aVSo, let me start projecting forward.
p9
aVThese are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,
p10
aVlooking what comes after computers.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis first one, Internet Zero, up here \u2014 this is a web server
p13
aVthat has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag \u2014
p14
aVabout a dollar \u2014 that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,
p15
aVand this is getting commercialized very quickly.
p16
aVAnd what's interesting about it isn't the cost;
p17
aVit's the way it encodes the Internet.
p18
aVIt uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet
p19
aVso you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically
p20
aVthrough a power line, through RF.
p21
aVIt takes the original principle of the Internet,
p22
aVwhich is inter-networking computers,
p23
aVand now lets devices inter-network.
p24
aVThat we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet
p25
aVand bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,
p26
aVthis internet of devices.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo this is the next step from there to here,
p29
aVand this is getting commercialized today.
p30
aVA step after that is a project on fungible computers.
p31
aVFungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.
p32
aVSo, half as much grain is half as much useful,
p33
aVbut half a baby or half a computer is less useful than
p34
aVa whole baby or a whole computer,
p35
aVand we've been trying to make computers that work that way.
p36
aVSo, what you see in the background is a prototype.
p37
aVThis was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,
p38
aVwho wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,
p39
aVyou don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,
p40
aVand pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.
p41
aVAnd that's what you see here.
p42
aVOn the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;
p43
aVon the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype
p44
aVwe made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,
p45
aVany of that stuff \u2014 it's just this material.
p46
aVUnlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,
p47
aVthis is a raw material.
p48
aVIf you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.
p49
aVIf you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.
p50
aVIf you need more resource, you just apply more computer.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, that's the step after this \u2014 of computing as a raw material.
p53
aVThat's still conventional bits, the step after that is \u2014
p54
aVthis is an earlier prototype in the lab;
p55
aVthis is high-speed video slowed down.
p56
aVNow, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.
p57
aVThis is showing making bits, this is showing \u2014
p58
aVonce again, slowed down so you can see it,
p59
aVbits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.
p60
aVSo, now we can compute that the output arranges material
p61
aVas well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides
p62
aVfrom an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored
p63
aVquantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so
p64
aVprograms rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.
p65
aVAll of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,
p66
aVnot as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,
p67
aVand they lead to the following recognition.
p68
aa(lp69
VWe all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?
p70
aVWell, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:
p71
aVfrom a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance
p72
aVto the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows
p73
aVif you add information and remove it to a signal,
p74
aVyou can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.
p75
aVAnd that's when we got the Internet.
p76
aVVon Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;
p77
aVhe showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state
p78
aVto make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:
p79
aVa differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,
p80
aVthe worse the answer got.
p81
aa(lp82
VAfter Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor
p83
aVis as reliable as the first one.
p84
aVBut all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
p85
aVA state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,
p86
aVor you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab
p87
aVuses a process a village artisan would recognize \u2014
p88
aVyou spread stuff around and bake it.
p89
aVAll the intelligence is external to the system;
p90
aVthe materials don't have information.
p91
aVYesterday you heard about molecular biology,
p92
aVwhich fundamentally computes to build.
p93
aVIt's an information processing system.
p94
aVWe've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,
p95
aVbut precisely the same idea, precisely the same math
p96
aVShannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out
p97
aVto the physical world. So, inspired by that,
p98
aVcolleagues in this program \u2014 the Center for Bits and Atoms
p99
aVat MIT \u2014 which is a group of people, like me,
p100
aVwho never understood the boundary between physical science
p101
aVand computer science. I would even go further and say
p102
aVcomputer science is one of the worst things that ever happened
p103
aVto either computers or to science \u2014
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV\u2014 because the canon \u2014 computer science \u2014
p106
aVmany of them are great but the canon of computer science
p107
aVprematurely froze a model of computation
p108
aVbased on technology that was available in 1950,
p109
aVand nature's a much more powerful computer than that.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the
p112
aVfirst students to emerge from this program.
p113
aVWe started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.
p114
aVThis was just a proof of principle he did of tiles
p115
aVthat interact magnetically, where you write a code,
p116
aVmuch like protein folding, that specifies their structure.
p117
aVSo, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;
p118
aVthe material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways
p119
aVthat protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.
p120
aVYou can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.
p121
aVThe video on the upper right \u2014 I won't show for time \u2014
p122
aVshows self-replication, templating so something can make something
p123
aVthat can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,
p124
aVnine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show
p125
aVthe best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,
p126
aVin functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails
p127
aVthat code for their assembly \u2014 so, much like the magnets,
p128
aVbut now on nanometer scales.
p129
aVLaser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate
p130
aVfunctional systems, all the way up to building buildings,
p131
aVnot by having blueprints,
p132
aVbut having the parts code for the structure of the building.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies
p135
aVto digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools
p136
aVbut computers that are tools, where the output of a program
p137
aVrearranges atoms as well as bits.
p138
aVNow, to do that \u2014 with your tax dollars, thank you \u2014
p139
aVI bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal
p140
aVto the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,
p141
aVall in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication
p142
aVby a discipline or a length scale.
p143
aVSo we put together focused nano beam writers
p144
aVand supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,
p147
aVI was spending too much time teaching students to use them.
p148
aVSo I started teaching a class, modestly called,
p149
aV"How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative;
p150
aVit was just for a few research students.
p151
aVBut the first day of class looked like this.
p152
aVYou know, hundreds of people came in begging,
p153
aVall my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.
p154
aVThen they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?
p155
aVAnd then the next \u2014
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aV\u2014 surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.
p158
aVThey were there because they wanted to make stuff.
p159
aVThey had no conventional technical background.
p160
aVAt the end of a semester they integrated their skills.
p161
aa(lp162
VI'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did
p163
aVwith her semester project.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.
p166
aVDo you ever find yourself in a situation
p167
aVwhere you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,
p168
aVor you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,
p169
aVor you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?
p170
aVWell, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.
p171
aVWhen a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.
p172
aVIt is also recorded for later release where, when and how
p173
aVthe user chooses.
p174
aV(Scream)
p175
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo, Einstein would like this.
p178
aVThis student made a web browser for parrots \u2014
p179
aVlets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.
p180
aVThis student's made an alarm clock you wrestle
p181
aVto prove you're awake; this is one that defends \u2014
p182
aVa dress that defends your personal space.
p183
aVThis isn't technology for communication;
p184
aVit's technology to prevent it.
p185
aVThis is a device that lets you see your music.
p186
aVThis is a student who made a machine that makes machines,
p187
aVand he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.
p188
aVJust year after year \u2014 and I finally realized
p189
aVthe students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication
p190
aVis products for a market of one person.
p191
aVYou don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;
p192
aVyou need this for what makes you unique.
p193
aVKen Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.
p194
aVBut you don't use it for inventory and payroll;
p195
aVDEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication
p196
aVin the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.
p197
aVYou need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.
p198
aVSo, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;
p199
aV20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.
p200
aVThe students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.
p201
aa(lp202
VToday, when you spend that much of your money,
p203
aVthere's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means
p204
aVclasses at a local school, a website \u2014 stuff that's just not that exciting.
p205
aVSo, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that
p206
aVinstead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.
p207
aVThis wasn't meant to be provocative or important,
p208
aVbut we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment
p209
aVthat approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.
p210
aVA laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,
p211
aVa sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,
p212
aVa micron scale,
p213
aVnumerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,
p214
aVprogramming tools for less than a dollar,
p215
aV100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns
p216
aVand microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.
p217
aVThis wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston
p218
aVto Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast
p219
aVto Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,
p220
aVto the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,
p221
aVfor all the attention to the digital divide,
p222
aVwe would find unused computers in all these places.
p223
aVA farmer in a rural village \u2014 a kid needs to measure and modify
p224
aVthe world, not just get information about it on a screen.
p225
aVThat there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide
p226
aVbigger than the digital divide.
p227
aVAnd the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, in place after place
p230
aVwe saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,
p231
aVwhere we didn't \u2014 this is too crazy to think of.
p232
aVWe didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;
p233
aVwe'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.
p234
aVYou can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.
p235
aVThis is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech
p236
aVon-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.
p237
aVIt goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education
p238
aVinformally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.
p239
aVWe designed a network sensor, and kids would show up
p240
aVand refuse to leave the lab.
p241
aVThere was a girl who insisted we stay late at night \u2014
p242
aV(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.
p243
aV\u2014 her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.
p244
aVSo she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,
p245
aVlearning how to program it. She didn't really know
p246
aVwhat she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew
p247
aVshe just had to do it. There was something electric about it.
p248
aVThis is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night
p249
aVand I think I was the only person surprised when what she built
p250
aVworked the first time.
p251
aVAnd I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say
p252
aVthey can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,
p253
aVbut it's distributed over many people and many sites
p254
aVand they can't do in an afternoon
p255
aVwhat this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.
p256
aV(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.
p257
aVI made a stacking board.
p258
aVAnd, again, that was just for the joy of it.
p259
aa(lp260
VThen these labs started doing serious problem solving \u2014
p261
aVinstrumentation for agriculture in India,
p262
aVsteam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,
p263
aVhigh-gain antennas in thin client computers.
p264
aVAnd then, in turn, businesses started to grow,
p265
aVlike making these antennas.
p266
aVAnd finally, the lab started doing invention.
p267
aVWe're learning more from them than we're giving them.
p268
aVI was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.
p269
aVThey invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box \u2014
p270
aVwhich, as you see up there, that's becoming a business \u2014
p271
aVbut their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,
p272
aVso there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on
p273
aVscaling the work of eight-year-old children
p274
aVbecause they had better designs.
p275
aVReal invention is happening in these labs.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd I still kept \u2014 so, in the last year I've been spending time with
p278
aVheads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,
p279
aVand I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.
p280
aVWait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.
p281
aVAnd I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie
p282
aVinventing UNIX on a PDP.
p283
aVPDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.
p284
aVThey were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,
p285
aVbut they brought computing down to work groups,
p286
aVand everything we do today happened there.
p287
aVThese Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.
p288
aVThe projection of digital fabrication
p289
aVisn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.
p290
aVWe talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.
p291
aVIt was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.
p292
aVIn the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era
p293
aVof digital fabrication.
p294
aVThe only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.
p295
aa(lp296
VIn DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;
p297
aVin the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of \u2014
p298
aVthey all want to talk about it, but it breaks
p299
aVtheir organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,
p300
aVin many cases, to equip ordinary people to create
p301
aVrather than consume technology.
p302
aVAnd that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention
p303
aVcoming from this community surprised me:
p304
aVit's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway \u2014
p305
aVthis is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground
p306
aVrather than the sky because that's where the satellites are \u2014
p307
aVthe lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.
p308
aVIt was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains
p309
aVbut it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.
p310
aVThis isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially
p311
aVa village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,
p312
aVand those have been growing up around these Fab Labs
p313
aVall around the world.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo this program has split into an NGO foundation,
p316
aVa Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.
p317
aVThe person who runs it nicely describes it as
p318
aV"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:"
p319
aVit's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,
p320
aVand then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's
p321
aVmaking it possible.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.
p324
aVThere's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects
p325
aVto bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,
p326
aVso that everybody's got that that's what works.
p327
aVBut we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.
p328
aVComputing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet
p329
aVare these top-down mega-projects.
p330
aVIf this room full of heroes is just clever enough,
p331
aVyou can solve the problems.
p332
aVThe message coming from the Fab Labs is that
p333
aVthe other five billion people on the planet
p334
aVaren't just technical sinks; they're sources.
p335
aVThe real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world
p336
aVto locally design and produce solutions to local problems.
p337
aVI thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,
p338
aVbut it's where we are today.
p339
aVIt breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.
p340
aVThe hardest thing at this point is the social engineering
p341
aVand the organizational engineering, but it's here today.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing
p344
aVis required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version \u2014
p345
aVthis is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper \u2014
p346
aVand what's happened is, year after year after year,
p347
aVwe've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled
p348
aVand we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,
p349
aVand we've scaled and we've scaled,
p350
aVand there's this looming bug of what's going to happen
p351
aVat the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.
p352
aVBut we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,
p353
aVfrom programming bits to programming atoms,
p354
aVturns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug
p355
aVto the ultimate feature.
p356
aVSo, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,
p357
aVwhere the output of computation programs the physical world.
p358
aVSo, together, these two projects answer questions
p359
aVI hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app
p360
aVfor personal fabrication in the developed world
p361
aVis technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology
p362
aVthat touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology
p363
aVfor a very long time.
p364
aVAnd the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation
p365
aVand the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions
p366
aVto local problems. Thank you.
