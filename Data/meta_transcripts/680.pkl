VI believe that there are new, hidden tensions
p4
aVthat are actually happening between people and institutions \u2014
p5
aVinstitutions that are the institutions that people
p6
aVinhabit in their daily life:
p7
aVschools, hospitals, workplaces,
p8
aVfactories, offices, etc.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd something that I see happening
p11
aVis something that I would like to call
p12
aVa sort of "democratization of intimacy."
p13
aVAnd what do I mean by that?
p14
aVI mean that what people are doing
p15
aVis, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,
p16
aVthey are breaking an imposed isolation
p17
aVthat these institutions are imposing on them.
p18
aa(lp19
VHow are they doing this? They're doing it
p20
aVin a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,
p21
aVby IMing from their office to their friends,
p22
aVby texting under the desk.
p23
aVThe pictures that you're seeing behind me
p24
aVare people that I visited in the last few months.
p25
aVAnd I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
p26
aVAnd somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.
p27
aVOne young woman brought her grandfather.
p28
aVFor 20 years, I've been looking at how people use
p29
aVchannels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.
p30
aVWhat we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,
p31
aVpeople are communicating on a regular basis
p32
aVwith five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, lets take some data. Facebook.
p35
aVRecently some sociologists from Facebook \u2014
p36
aVFacebook is the channel that you would expect
p37
aVis the most enlargening of all channels.
p38
aVAnd an average user,
p39
aVsaid Cameron Marlow,
p40
aVfrom Facebook, has about 120 friends.
p41
aVBut he actually talks to,
p42
aVhas two-way exchanges with, about four to six people
p43
aVon a regular base, depending on his gender.
p44
aVAcademic research on instant messaging
p45
aValso shows 100 people on buddy lists,
p46
aVbut fundamentally people chat with two, three, four \u2014
p47
aVanyway, less than five.
p48
aVMy own research on cellphones and voice calls
p49
aVshows that 80 percent of the calls
p50
aVare actually made to four people. 80 percent.
p51
aVAnd when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.
p52
aVA lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
p53
aVI mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes
p54
aVwhen I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.
p55
aVAnd some sociologists actually feel that
p56
aVit's a closure, it's a cocooning,
p57
aVthat we're disengaging from the public.
p58
aVAnd I would actually, I would like to show you that
p59
aVif we actually look at who is doing it,
p60
aVand from where they're doing it,
p61
aVactually there is an incredible social transformation.
p62
aa(lp63
VThere are three stories that I think are quite good examples.
p64
aVThe first gentleman, he's a baker.
p65
aVAnd so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
p66
aVAnd around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,
p67
aVcleans his hands from the flour
p68
aVand calls his wife.
p69
aVHe just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
p70
aVAnd I've heard this story a number of times.
p71
aVA young factory worker who works night shifts,
p72
aVwho manages to sneak away from the factory floor,
p73
aVwhere there is CCTV by the way,
p74
aVand find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night
p75
aVhe can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.
p76
aVOr a mother who, at four o'clock,
p77
aVsuddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet
p78
aVto check that her children are safely home.
p79
aa(lp80
VThen there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.
p81
aVThey've lived in Italy for a number of years.
p82
aVThey Skype with their families a few times a week.
p83
aVBut once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,
p84
aVpull out the webcam and actually have dinner
p85
aVwith their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.
p86
aVAnd I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago
p87
aVfrom a very modest family
p88
aVof immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.
p89
aVThey had set up a big screen in their living room,
p90
aVand every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.
p91
aVBut Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist
p92
aVwho is working on Filipina migrant women
p93
aVwho leave their children back in the Philippines,
p94
aVwas telling me about how much parenting is going on
p95
aVthrough Skype,
p96
aVand how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd then there is the third couple. They are two friends.
p99
aVThey chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.
p100
aVAnd finally, finally, they've managed to put
p101
aVinstant messaging on their computers at work.
p102
aVAnd now, obviously, they have it open.
p103
aVWhenever they have a moment they chat to each other.
p104
aVAnd this is exactly what we've been seeing
p105
aVwith teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,
p106
aVand texting under the table to their friends.
p107
aVSo, none of these cases are unique.
p108
aVI mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut what is really exceptional is the setting.
p111
aVSo, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:
p112
aVfactory, migration, office.
p113
aVBut it could be in a school, it could be an administration,
p114
aVit could be a hospital.
p115
aVThree settings that, if we just step back 15 years,
p116
aVif you just think back 15 years,
p117
aVwhen you clocked in,
p118
aVwhen you clocked in to an office,
p119
aVwhen you clocked in to a factory,
p120
aVthere was no contact for the whole duration of the time,
p121
aVthere was no contact with your private sphere.
p122
aVIf you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.
p123
aVIf you were in management, oh, that was a different story.
p124
aVMaybe you had a direct line.
p125
aVIf you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.
p126
aVBut basically, when you walked into those buildings,
p127
aVthe private sphere was left behind you.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd this has become such a norm of our professional lives,
p130
aVsuch a norm and such an expectation.
p131
aVAnd it had nothing to do with technical capability.
p132
aVThe phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there
p133
aVyour commitment was fully to the task at hand,
p134
aVfully to the people around you.
p135
aVThat was where the focus had to be.
p136
aVAnd this has become such a cultural norm
p137
aVthat we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
p138
aVIf you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school
p139
aVare just dedicated to take away the children,
p140
aVto make them used to staying long hours away from their family.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then the school enacts perfectly well.
p143
aVIt mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:
p144
aVrituals of entry, rituals of exit,
p145
aVthe schedules, the uniforms in this country,
p146
aVthings that identify you, team-building activities,
p147
aVteam building that will allow you to basically
p148
aVbe with a random group of kids, or a random group of people
p149
aVthat you will have to be with for a number of time.
p150
aVAnd of course, the major thing:
p151
aVlearn to pay attention,
p152
aVto concentrate and focus your attention.
p153
aVThis only started about 150 years ago.
p154
aVIt only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,
p155
aVand of industrial revolution.
p156
aVWhen people basically had to go somewhere else to work
p157
aVand carry out the work.
p158
aVAnd when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,
p159
aVwhere there was a clear distinction between the private sphere
p160
aVand the public sphere.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.
p163
aVThey were living on top of the land they were laboring.
p164
aVThey were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
p165
aVAnd if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,
p166
aVeven our cities.
p167
aVIf you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs
p168
aVall have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.
p169
aVNow we have sprawling residential suburbias
p170
aVthat are well distinct from production areas
p171
aVand commercial areas.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd actually, over these 150 years,
p174
aVthere has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.
p175
aVSo the lower the status of the job
p176
aVand of the person carrying out, the more removed
p177
aVhe would be from his personal sphere.
p178
aVPeople have taken this amazing possibility
p179
aVof actually being in contact all through the day
p180
aVor in all types of situations.
p181
aVAnd they are doing it massively.
p182
aVThe Pew Institute, which produces good data
p183
aVon a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,
p184
aVsays that \u2014 and I think that this number is conservative \u2014
p185
aV50 percent of anybody with email access at work
p186
aVis actually doing private email from his office.
p187
aVI really think that the number is conservative.
p188
aVIn my own research, we saw that the peak for private email
p189
aVis actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.
p190
aV75 percent of people admit doing private
p191
aVconversations from work on their mobile phones.
p192
aV100 percent are using text.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere
p195
aVis not terribly successful with all institutions.
p196
aVI'm always surprised the U.S. Army
p197
aVsociologists are discussing of the impact
p198
aVfor instance, of soldiers in Iraq
p199
aVhaving daily contact with their families.
p200
aVBut there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.
p201
aVAnd every day, every single day,
p202
aVI read news that makes me cringe,
p203
aVlike a $15 fine
p204
aVto kids in Texas,
p205
aVfor using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
p206
aVImmediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,
p207
aVif seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
p208
aVCompanies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.
p209
aa(lp210
VBehind issues of security and safety,
p211
aVwhich have always been the arguments for social control,
p212
aVin fact what is going on is that
p213
aVthese institutions are trying to decide
p214
aVwho, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,
p215
aVto decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
p216
aVAnd they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense,
p217
aVthis movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.
