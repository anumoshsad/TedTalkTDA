VI want to take you back basically to my hometown,
p4
aVand to a picture of my hometown of the week
p5
aVthat "Emergence" came out.
p6
aVAnd it's a picture we've seen several times.
p7
aVBasically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.
p8
aVI live right there in the West Village,
p9
aVso the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.
p10
aVWe had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours \u2014
p11
aVwe hadn't taken it from somebody else.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences
p16
aVof a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close \u2014
p17
aVthat my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all
p18
aVor walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building,
p19
aVwas that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.
p20
aVBecause so much of that book was a celebration of the power
p21
aVand creative potential of density, of largely urban density,
p22
aVof connecting people and putting them together in one place,
p23
aVand putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas
p24
aVand share physical space together.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd it seemed to me looking at that \u2014 that tower burning and then falling,
p27
aVthose towers burning and falling \u2014 that in fact, one of the lessons
p28
aVhere was that density kills.
p29
aVAnd that of all the technologies that were exploited
p30
aVto make that carnage come into being,
p31
aVprobably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives
p32
aVwere those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings
p33
aV110 stories above the ground.
p34
aVIf they hadn't been crowded \u2014
p35
aVyou compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,
p36
aVand you can see that very powerfully.
p37
aVAnd so I started to think, well, you know, density, density \u2014
p38
aVI'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.
p41
aVAnd then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,
p42
aVand you could sense that the air was not healthy.
p43
aVAnd so even though there were no cars still in the West Village
p44
aVwhere we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,
p45
aVa large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,
p46
aVwhich was located about 20 blocks away, north.
p47
aVAnd so I went out.
p48
aVAnd obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p49
aVso I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.
p50
aVAnd I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me
p51
aVas I was walking north to buy this air filter,
p52
aVwhich was that the streets were completely alive with people.
p53
aa(lp54
VThere was an incredible \u2014 it was, you know, a beautiful day,
p55
aVas it was for about a week after,
p56
aVand the West Village had never seemed more lively.
p57
aVI walked up along Hudson Street \u2014
p58
aVwhere Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book
p59
aVthat so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" \u2014
p60
aVpast the White Horse Tavern,
p61
aVthat great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,
p62
aVand the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.
p63
aVAnd all the people who lived in the neighborhood,
p64
aVwho owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,
p65
aVwere all out there \u2014 had them all open.
p66
aVPeople were out.
p67
aVThere were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.
p68
aVAnd it was a beautiful urban day,
p69
aVand the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.
p70
aVThe city was there.
p71
aVAll the things that make a great city successful
p72
aVand all the things that make a great city stimulating \u2014
p73
aVthey were all on display there on those streets.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd I thought, well, this is the power of a city.
p76
aVI mean, the power of the city \u2014
p77
aVwe talked about cities as being centralized in space,
p78
aVbut what makes them so strong most of the time
p79
aVis they're decentralized in function.
p80
aVThey don't have a center executive branch that you can take out
p81
aVand cause the whole thing to fail.
p82
aVIf they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.
p83
aVI mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,
p84
aVwas destroyed by the attacks,
p85
aVand obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.
p86
aVBut nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,
p87
aVthe city had never looked more alive.
p88
aVIf you'd gone into the minds of the people,
p89
aVwell, you would have seen a lot of trauma,
p90
aVand you would have seen a lot of heartache,
p91
aVand you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut the system itself of this city was thriving.
p94
aVSo I took heart in seeing that.
p95
aVSo I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,
p96
aVand how some of those reasons kind of map
p97
aVon to where the Web is going right now.
p98
aVThe question that I found myself asking to people
p99
aVwhen I was talking about the book afterwards is \u2014
p100
aVwhen you've talked about emergent behavior,
p101
aVwhen you've talked about collective intelligence,
p102
aVthe best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that
p103
aVis to ask, who builds a neighborhood?
p104
aVWho decides that Soho should have this personality
p105
aVand that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?
p106
aVWell, there are some kind of executive decisions,
p107
aVbut mostly the answer is \u2014 everybody and nobody.
p108
aVEverybody contributes a little bit.
p109
aVNo single person is really the ultimate actor
p110
aVbehind the personality of a neighborhood.
p111
aa(lp112
VSame thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive
p113
aVpost-9/11 in my neighborhood?
p114
aVWell, it was the whole city.
p115
aVThe whole system kind of working on it,
p116
aVand everybody contributing a small little part.
p117
aVAnd this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web
p118
aVin a bunch of interesting ways \u2014
p119
aVmost of which weren't around, actually,
p120
aVexcept in very experimental things,
p121
aVwhen I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.
p122
aVSo it's been a very optimistic time, I think,
p123
aVand I want to just talk about a few of those things.
p124
aVI think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity
p125
aVthat's starting to emerge online right now.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd the old one looked like this.
p128
aVThis is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.
p129
aVIt's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online
p130
aVwho's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus
p131
aVand Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" \u2014 those are his links.
p132
aVBut nothing really says
p133
aVthis model of interactivity \u2014 which was so exciting and captures the real,
p134
aVthe Web Zeitgeist of 1995 \u2014 than
p135
aV"Click here for a picture of my dog."
p136
aVThat is \u2014 you know, there's no sentence
p137
aVthat kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,
p138
aVwhich is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog
p139
aVand link to it, and somebody reading the page
p140
aVhas the power to click on that link or not click on that link.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense \u2014
p143
aVto reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday \u2014
p144
aVthat was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that
p145
aVpowered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:
p146
aVthat you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,
p147
aVand it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.
p148
aVBut it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.
p149
aVThere's one person putting up the link, and there's another person
p150
aVon the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.
p151
aVThe new model is much more like this,
p152
aVand we've already seen a couple of references to this.
p153
aVThis is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.
p154
aVAbout two months ago, I had the great breakthrough \u2014
p155
aVone of my great, kind of shining achievements \u2014
p156
aVwhich is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson."
p157
aVThere's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson
p158
aVwho has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,
p163
aVbut Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.
p164
aVIt's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.
p165
aVBecause effectively, what's happening here,
p166
aVwhat's creating this page, obviously \u2014 and we all know this,
p167
aVbut it's worth just thinking about it \u2014
p168
aVis not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,
p169
aVbut rather somehow the entire web of people
p170
aVputting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,
p171
aVand Google just sitting there and running the numbers.
p172
aVSo there's this collective decision-making that's going on.
p173
aVThis page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,
p174
aVand Google is just helping us
p175
aVkind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, they're more innovative \u2014 well, Google's pretty innovative \u2014
p178
aVbut there are some new twists on this.
p179
aVThere's this incredibly interesting new site \u2014 Technorati \u2014
p180
aVthat's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.
p181
aVAnd these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.
p182
aVHe's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.
p183
aVAnd he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,
p184
aVand so you have kind of an authority \u2014
p185
aVa weblog that has a lot of links to it
p186
aVis more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.
p187
aVAnd so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,
p188
aVyou can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?
p189
aVAnd you can get a list.
p190
aVThis is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
p191
aVYou can also rank it by the latest posts.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo when I was talking in "Emergence,"
p194
aVI talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture
p195
aVthat, basically, you could link to somebody else
p196
aVbut they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
p197
aVAnd that was one of the reasons why the web
p198
aVwasn't quite as emergent as it could be
p199
aVbecause you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism
p200
aVto be able to really do interesting things.
p201
aVWell, something like Technorati is supplying that.
p202
aVNow what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,
p203
aVwhere he talks about everything being purposive in the Web \u2014
p204
aVthere's nothing artificial.
p205
aVHe has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,
p206
aVif you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.
p207
aVAnd he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus."
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.
p210
aVI could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati
p211
aVon the right-hand side of my page,
p212
aVand they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.
p213
aVThat little list there would change.
p214
aVI wouldn't really be directly in control of it.
p215
aVSo it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,
p216
aVwrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.
p217
aVNow, what you're having here is basically a global brain
p218
aVthat you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.
p219
aVAnd there are all these interesting tools.
p220
aVGoogle does the Google Zeitgeist,
p221
aVwhich looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,
p222
aVand they publish it with lots of fun graphs.
p223
aVAnd I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,
p224
aVso I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.
p225
aa(lp226
VThere's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,
p227
aVwhich is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching
p228
aVfor Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.
p229
aVThe Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.
p230
aVWell, you know, we should expect to see that.
p231
aVThat's not necessarily something we didn't know already.
p232
aVSo the key thing in terms of these new tools
p233
aVthat are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,
p234
aVthat are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream \u2014
p235
aVthe question is, are you finding out something new?
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share
p238
aVwhich is basically, you take an abstract term,
p239
aVand you search Google for that term,
p240
aVand then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.
p241
aVSo basically, the number of pages that mention this term,
p242
aVthat also mention this page, the percentage of those pages
p243
aVis that person's Google Share of that term.
p244
aVSo you can do kind of interesting contests.
p245
aVLike for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.
p246
aVSo Richard Saul Wurman
p247
aVhas about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.
p248
aVOur good friend Chris has about a six percent \u2014 but with a bullet, I might add.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VBut the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.
p253
aVAnd it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.
p254
aVI had no idea.
p255
aVNo, that's not true.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVI made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide
p258
aVof the Mola mola fish.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VI also did \u2014 and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel \u2014
p263
aVbut I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.
p264
aVSo right here \u2014 now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,
p265
aVso this is 0.7 percent \u2014 Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.
p266
aVRight below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.
p267
aVSo Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.
p268
aVBut what's interesting is you can then broaden the search
p269
aVand actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.
p270
aVSo Gary Bauer is not too far behind \u2014
p271
aVhas slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.
p272
aVAnd right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So \u2014
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVyou can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.
p275
aVAnd by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,
p276
aVI think, right there.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VHubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,
p281
aVI think it would be good next year.
p282
aVAnother quick thing \u2014 this is a slightly different thing,
p283
aVbut this analysis some of you may have seen.
p284
aVIt just came out. This is bursty words,
p285
aVlooking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.
p286
aVSo these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,
p287
aVso they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,
p288
aVthat didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.
p289
aVSo the first one is \u2014 these are the bursty words around 1860s \u2014
p290
aVslaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.
p291
aVThat's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.
p292
aVThey're talking about slavery in 1860.
p293
aV1935 \u2014 relief, depression, recovery banks.
p294
aVAnd OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well \u2014 that's pretty obvious.
p295
aV1985, right at the center of the Reagan years \u2014
p296
aVthat's, we're, there's, we've, it's.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that
p301
aV"emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.
p302
aVSo you know, you can actually download \u2014 it's hard to remember those.
p303
aVBut seriously, actually, what you can see there,
p304
aVin a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,
p305
aVis Reagan reinventing the political language of the country
p306
aVand shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic \u2014
p307
aVcontracting all those verbs.
p308
aVYou know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do,"
p309
aVbut with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.
p310
aVAnd so something we kind of knew,
p311
aVbut you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.
p312
aVI'll go very quickly.
p313
aVThe question now \u2014 and this is the really interesting question \u2014
p314
aVis, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now
p315
aVin the overall Web ecosystem \u2014 and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs
p316
aVbecause they are really kind of at the cutting edge.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.
p319
aVNow there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky
p320
aVthat got a lot of attention about a month ago,
p321
aVand this is basically the distribution of links
p322
aVon the web to all these various different blogs.
p323
aVIt follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,
p324
aVand a long tail of blogs with very few links.
p325
aVSo 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
p326
aVNow this is a very interesting thing.
p327
aVIt's caused a lot of controversy
p328
aVbecause people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,
p329
aVone modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd so the question is, "Why is this happening?"
p332
aVIt's not being imposed by fiat from above.
p333
aVIt's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.
p334
aVNow, what's great about it is that people are working on \u2014
p335
aVwithin seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing
p336
aVthe underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.
p337
aVAnd basically, the shape appears
p338
aVlargely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.
p339
aVif you're the first site there, everybody links to you.
p340
aVIf you're the second site there, most people link to you.
p341
aVAnd so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,
p342
aVand it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,
p343
aVand then you get this kind of shape.
p344
aVAnd so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,
p345
aVliterally as Shirky started \u2014 after he published his piece \u2014
p346
aVwas something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.
p347
aVAnd he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,
p348
aVthat suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.
p351
aVSo he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.
p352
aVAnd it creates a kind of planned emergence.
p353
aVYou're not totally in control,
p354
aVbut you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways
p355
aVbecause you have an end result which is
p356
aVmaybe a more democratic spread of voices.
p357
aVSo the most amazing thing about this \u2014 and I'll end on this note \u2014
p358
aVis, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems
p359
aVare not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern
p360
aVand changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.
p361
aVSo the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate
p362
aVabout power laws and software that could change it
p363
aVis the fact that we're having the conversation.
p364
aVI hope it continues here.
p365
aVThanks a lot.
