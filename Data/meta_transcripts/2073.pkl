VSo recently,
p4
aVsome white guys and some black women
p5
aVswapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.
p6
aVThey didn't change their content,
p7
aVthey kept tweeting the same as usual,
p8
aVbut suddenly, the white guys noticed
p9
aVthey were getting called the n-word all the time
p10
aVand they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,
p11
aVwhereas the black women all of a sudden
p12
aVnoticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, if you're my five-year-old,
p15
aVyour Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies
p16
aVand occasionally fairies riding puppies.
p17
aVThat's a thing. Google it.
p18
aVBut the rest of us know that the Internet
p19
aVcan be a really ugly place.
p20
aVI'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates
p21
aVthat I think are healthy for our democracy.
p22
aVI'm talking about nasty personal attacks.
p23
aVMaybe it's happened to you, but it's at least
p24
aVtwice as likely to happen, and be worse,
p25
aVif you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,
p26
aVor more than one at the same time.
p27
aVIn fact, just as I was writing this talk,
p28
aVI found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.
p29
aVThe bio says that I'm a
p30
aV"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career
p31
aVis spreading my perverse sexuality."
p32
aVWhich, incidentally, is only a third correct.
p33
aVI mean, lies! (Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VBut seriously, we all say we hate this crap.
p36
aVThe question is whether you're willing to make
p37
aVa personal sacrifice to change it.
p38
aVI don't mean giving up the Internet.
p39
aVI mean changing the way you click,
p40
aVbecause clicking is a public act.
p41
aVIt's no longer the case
p42
aVthat a few powerful elites control all the media
p43
aVand the rest of us are just passive receivers.
p44
aVIncreasingly, we're all the media.
p45
aVI used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,
p46
aVI put on a lot of makeup,
p47
aVI go on television, I talk about the news.
p48
aVThat is a public act of making media.
p49
aVAnd then I go home and I browse the web
p50
aVand I'm reading Twitter,
p51
aVand that's a private act of consuming media.
p52
aVI mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.
p53
aVWrong.
p54
aVEverything we blog, everything we Tweet,
p55
aVand everything we click
p56
aVis a public act of making media.
p57
aVWe are the new editors.
p58
aVWe decide what gets attention
p59
aVbased on what we give our attention to.
p60
aVThat's how the media works now.
p61
aVThere's all these hidden algorithms that decide
p62
aVwhat you see more of and what we all see more of
p63
aVbased on what you click on,
p64
aVand that in turn shapes our whole culture.
p65
aa(lp66
VOver three out of five Americans think we have
p67
aVa major incivility problem in our country right now,
p68
aVbut I'm going to guess that at least three out of five
p69
aVAmericans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,
p70
aVrumor-mongering trash that feeds
p71
aVthe nastiest impulses in our society.
p72
aVIn an increasingly noisy media landscape,
p73
aVthe incentive is to make more noise to be heard,
p74
aVand that tyranny of the loud
p75
aVencourages the tyranny of the nasty.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt does not have to be that way.
p78
aVIt does not.
p79
aVWe can change the incentive.
p80
aVFor starters, there are two things we can all do.
p81
aVFirst, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt.
p82
aVIf someone is being abused online, do something.
p83
aVBe a hero. This is your chance.
p84
aVSpeak up. Speak out. Be a good person.
p85
aVDrown out the negative with the positive.
p86
aVAnd second, we've got to stop clicking
p87
aVon the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding
p88
aVlinkbait.
p89
aVIf you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian
p90
aVall the time programming,
p91
aVyou've got to stop clicking on the stories
p92
aVabout Kim Kardashian's sideboob.
p93
aVI know you do it. (Applause)
p94
aVYou too, apparently.
p95
aVI mean, really, same example:
p96
aVif you don't like politicians calling each other names,
p97
aVstop clicking on the stories
p98
aVabout what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party.
p99
aVClicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.
p100
aVIt makes it worse, the fire spreads.
p101
aVOur whole culture gets burned.
p102
aa(lp103
VIf what gets the most clicks wins,
p104
aVthen we have to start shaping the world we want
p105
aVwith our clicks,
p106
aVbecause clicking is a public act.
p107
aVSo click responsibly. Thank you.
