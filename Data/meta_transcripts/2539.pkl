VI used to have this recurring dream
p4
aVwhere I'd walk into a roomful of people,
p5
aVand I'd try not to make eye contact with anyone.
p6
aVUntil someone notices me,
p7
aVand I just panic.
p8
aVAnd the person walks up to me,
p9
aVand says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.
p10
aVAnd what is your name?"
p11
aVAnd I'm just quiet, unable to respond.
p12
aVAfter some awkward silence, he goes,
p13
aV"Have you forgotten your name?"
p14
aVAnd I'm still quiet.
p15
aVAnd then, slowly, all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me
p16
aVand ask, almost in unison,
p17
aa(lp18
V(Voice-over, several voices) "Have you forgotten your name?"
p19
aVAs the chant gets louder, I want to respond, but I don't.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm a visual artist.
p22
aVSome of my work is humorous,
p23
aVand some is a bit funny but in a sad way.
p24
aVAnd one thing that I really enjoy doing
p25
aVis making these little animations
p26
aVwhere I get to do the voice-over for all kinds of characters.
p27
aVI've been a bear.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VSafwat Saleem: I've been a whale.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSS: I've been a greeting card.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSS: And my personal favorite is Frankenstein's monster.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Video) Frankenstein's monster (SS's voice): (Grunts)
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VSS: I just had to grunt a lot for that one.
p52
aa(lp53
VA few years ago, I made this educational video
p54
aVabout the history of video games.
p55
aVAnd for that one, I got to do the voice of Space Invader.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.
p58
aa(lp59
VSS: A dream come true, really,
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aVAnd when that video was posted online,
p63
aVI just sat there on the computer, hitting "refresh,"
p64
aVexcited to see the response.
p65
aVThe first comment comes in.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Video) Comment: Great job.
p68
aVSS: Yes!
p69
aVI hit "refresh."
p70
aa(lp71
V(Video) Comment: Excellent video. I look forward to the next one.
p72
aa(lp73
VSS: This was just the first of a two-part video.
p74
aVI was going to work on the second one next.
p75
aVI hit "refresh."
p76
aa(lp77
V(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO? WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VSS: People other than my mom were saying nice things about me,
p82
aVon the Internet!
p83
aVIt felt like I had finally arrived.
p84
aVI hit "refresh."
p85
aa(lp86
V(Video) Comment: His voice is annoying. No offense.
p87
aa(lp88
VSS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Video) Comment: Could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth?
p91
aa(lp92
VSS: OK, at least the feedback is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."
p93
aa(lp94
V(Video) Comment: Please don't use this narrator again
p95
aVu can barely understand him.
p96
aa(lp97
VSS: Refresh.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow because of the Indian accent.
p100
aa(lp101
VSS: OK, OK, OK, two things.
p102
aVNumber one, I don't have an Indian accent,
p103
aVI have a Pakistani accent, OK?
p104
aVAnd number two, I clearly have a Pakistani accent.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VBut comments like that kept coming in,
p109
aVso I figured I should just ignore them
p110
aVand start working on the second part of the video.
p111
aVI recorded my audio,
p112
aVbut every time I sat down to edit,
p113
aVI just could not do it.
p114
aVEvery single time, it would take me back to my childhood,
p115
aVwhen I had a much harder time speaking.
p116
aa(lp117
VI've stuttered for as long as I can remember.
p118
aVI was the kid in class
p119
aVwho would never raise his hand when he had a question \u2014
p120
aVor knew the answer.
p121
aVEvery time the phone rang,
p122
aVI would run to the bathroom so I would not have to answer it.
p123
aVIf it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.
p124
aVI spent a lot of time in the bathroom.
p125
aVAnd I hated introducing myself,
p126
aVespecially in groups.
p127
aVI'd always stutter on my name, and there was usually someone who'd go,
p128
aV"Have you forgotten your name?"
p129
aVAnd then everybody would laugh.
p130
aVThat joke never got old.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VI spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke,
p135
aVit would become obvious that there was something wrong with me,
p136
aVthat I was not normal.
p137
aVSo I mostly stayed quiet.
p138
aVAnd so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work
p139
aVwas a huge step for me.
p140
aVEvery time I record audio,
p141
aVI fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times,
p142
aVand then I go back in
p143
aVand pick the ones where I think I suck the least.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
p146
aVI can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.
p147
aVAnd if I stutter along the way, and if I stutter along the way,
p148
aVI just go back in and fix it.
p149
aVIt's magic.
p150
aa(lp151
VSS: Using my highly edited voice in my work
p152
aVwas a way for me to finally sound normal to myself.
p153
aVBut after the comments on the video,
p154
aVit no longer made me feel normal.
p155
aVAnd so I stopped using my voice in my work.
p156
aVSince then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.
p157
aVAnd I've come to understand
p158
aVthat "normal" has a lot to do with expectations.
p159
aa(lp160
VLet me give you an example.
p161
aVI came across this story
p162
aVabout the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.
p163
aVNow, Homer mentions very few colors in his writing.
p164
aVAnd even when he does,
p165
aVhe seems to get them quite a bit wrong.
p166
aVFor example, the sea is described as wine red,
p167
aVpeople's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.
p168
aVBut it's not just Homer.
p169
aVIf you look at all of the ancient literature \u2014
p170
aVAncient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian
p171
aVand even the original Hebrew Bible \u2014
p172
aVthey all mention very few colors.
p173
aVAnd the most popular theory for why that might be the case
p174
aVis that cultures begin to recognize a color
p175
aVonly once they have the ability to make that color.
p176
aVSo basically, if you can make a color,
p177
aVonly then can you see it.
p178
aVA color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make \u2014
p179
aVthey began to see that color fairly early on.
p180
aVBut a color like blue, which was much harder to make \u2014
p181
aVmany cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color
p182
aVuntil much later.
p183
aVThey didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
p184
aVSo until then, even though a color might be all around them,
p185
aVthey simply did not have the ability to see it.
p186
aVIt was invisIble.
p187
aVIt was not a part of their normal.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd that story has helped put my own experience into context.
p190
aVSo when I first read the comments on the video,
p191
aVmy initial reaction was to take it all very personally.
p192
aVBut the people commenting did not know
p193
aVhow self-conscious I am about my voice.
p194
aVThey were mostly reacting to my accent,
p195
aVthat it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut what is normal, anyway?
p198
aVWe know that reviewers will find more spelling errors in your writing
p199
aVif they think you're black.
p200
aVWe know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students.
p201
aVAnd we know that resumes with white-sounding names
p202
aVget more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names.
p203
aVWhy is that?
p204
aVBecause of our expectations of what is normal.
p205
aVWe think it is normal
p206
aVwhen a black student has spelling errors.
p207
aVWe think it is normal
p208
aVwhen a female or minority student does not succeed.
p209
aVAnd we think it is normal
p210
aVthat a white employee is a better hire than a black employee.
p211
aVBut studies also show that discrimination of this kind,
p212
aVin most cases, is simply favoritism,
p213
aVand it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to
p214
aVthan the desire to harm people that you can't relate to.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd not relating to people starts at a very early age.
p217
aVLet me give you an example.
p218
aVOne library that keeps track of characters
p219
aVin the children's book collection every year,
p220
aVfound that in 2014, only about 11 percent of the books
p221
aVhad a character of color.
p222
aVAnd just the year before, that number was about eight percent,
p223
aVeven though half of American children today come from a minority background.
p224
aVHalf.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo there are two big issues here.
p227
aVNumber one, children are told that they can be anything,
p228
aVthey can do anything,
p229
aVand yet, most stories that children of color consume
p230
aVare about people who are not like them.
p231
aVNumber two is that majority groups don't get to realize
p232
aVthe great extent to which they are similar to minorities \u2014
p233
aVour everyday experiences, our hopes,
p234
aVour dreams, our fears
p235
aVand our mutual love for hummus.
p236
aVIt's delicious!
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VJust like the color blue for Ancient Greeks,
p241
aVminorities are not a part of what we consider normal,
p242
aVbecause normal is simply a construction of what we've been exposed to,
p243
aVand how visible it is around us.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd this is where things get a bit difficult.
p246
aVI can accept the preexisting notion of normal \u2014 that normal is good,
p247
aVand anything outside of that very narrow definition of normal is bad.
p248
aVOr I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal
p249
aVwith my work
p250
aVand with my voice
p251
aVand with my accent
p252
aVand by standing here onstage,
p253
aVeven though I'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly starting to use my voice
p260
aVin my work again.
p261
aVAnd it feels good.
p262
aVIt does not mean I won't have a breakdown
p263
aVthe next time a couple dozen people say that I talk
p264
aV(Mumbling) like I have peanut butter in my mouth.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VSS: It just means I now have a much better understanding
p269
aVof what's at stake,
p270
aVand how giving up is not an option.
p271
aa(lp272
VThe Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize
p273
aVthat the sky was blue.
p274
aVIt took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring
p275
aVfor so long.
p276
aVAnd so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal,
p277
aVbecause doing so is going to allow us as a society
p278
aVto finally see the sky for what it is.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
