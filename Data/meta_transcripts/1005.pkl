VThis cell phone
p4
aVstarted its trajectory
p5
aVin an artisanal mine
p6
aVin the Eastern Congo.
p7
aVIt's mined by armed gangs
p8
aVusing slaves, child slaves,
p9
aVwhat the U.N. Security Council
p10
aVcalls "blood minerals,"
p11
aVthen traveled into some components
p12
aVand ended up in a factory
p13
aVin Shinjin in China.
p14
aVThat factory \u2014 over a dozen people have committed suicide
p15
aValready this year.
p16
aVOne man died after working a 36-hour shift.
p17
aVWe all love chocolate.
p18
aVWe buy it for our kids.
p19
aVEighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana
p20
aVand it's harvested by children.
p21
aVCote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.
p22
aVChildren have been trafficked from other conflict zones
p23
aVto come and work on the coffee plantations.
p24
aVHeparin \u2014 a blood thinner,
p25
aVa pharmaceutical product \u2014
p26
aVstarts out in artisanal workshops
p27
aVlike this in China,
p28
aVbecause the active ingredient
p29
aVcomes from pigs' intestines.
p30
aVYour diamond \u2014 you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."
p31
aVThis is a mine in Zimbabwe
p32
aVright now.
p33
aVCotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest
p34
aVexporter of cotton on Earth.
p35
aVEvery year when it comes to the cotton harvest,
p36
aVthe government shuts down the schools,
p37
aVputs the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields
p38
aVto spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.
p39
aVIt's forced child labor
p40
aVon an institutional scale.
p41
aVAnd all of those products probably end their lives
p42
aVin a dump like this one in Manila.
p43
aa(lp44
VThese places, these origins,
p45
aVrepresent governance gaps.
p46
aVThat's the politest description
p47
aVI have for them.
p48
aVThese are the dark pools
p49
aVwhere global supply chains begin \u2014
p50
aVthe global supply chains,
p51
aVwhich bring us our favorite brand name products.
p52
aVSome of these governance gaps
p53
aVare run by rogue states.
p54
aVSome of them are not states anymore at all.
p55
aVThey're failed states.
p56
aVSome of them
p57
aVare just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation
p58
aVis the best way to attract investment,
p59
aVpromote trade.
p60
aVEither way, they present us
p61
aVwith a huge moral and ethical dilemma.
p62
aVI know that none of us want to be accessories
p63
aVafter the fact
p64
aVof a human rights abuse
p65
aVin a global supply chain.
p66
aVBut right now,
p67
aVmost of the companies involved in these supply chains
p68
aVdon't have any way
p69
aVof assuring us
p70
aVthat nobody had to mortgage their future,
p71
aVnobody had to sacrifice their rights
p72
aVto bring us our favorite
p73
aVbrand name product.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, I didn't come here to depress you
p76
aVabout the state of the global supply chain.
p77
aVWe need a reality check.
p78
aVWe need to recognize just how serious
p79
aVa deficit of rights we have.
p80
aVThis is an independent republic,
p81
aVprobably a failed state.
p82
aVIt's definitely not a democratic state.
p83
aVAnd right now,
p84
aVthat independent republic of the supply chain
p85
aVis not being governed
p86
aVin a way that would satisfy us,
p87
aVthat we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.
p88
aVNow, that's not a new story.
p89
aVYou've seen the documentaries
p90
aVof sweatshops making garments
p91
aVall over the world, even in developed countries.
p92
aVYou want to see the classic sweatshop,
p93
aVmeet me at Madison Square Garden,
p94
aVI'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut take the example of heparin.
p97
aVIt's a pharmaceutical product.
p98
aVYou expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,
p99
aVprobably squeaky clean.
p100
aVThe problem is that the active ingredient in there \u2014
p101
aVas I mentioned earlier \u2014
p102
aVcomes from pigs.
p103
aVThe main American manufacturer
p104
aVof that active ingredient
p105
aVdecided a few years ago to relocate to China
p106
aVbecause it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.
p107
aVAnd their factory in China \u2014
p108
aVwhich probably is pretty clean \u2014
p109
aVis getting all of the ingredients
p110
aVfrom backyard abattoirs,
p111
aVwhere families slaughter pigs
p112
aVand extract the ingredient.
p113
aVSo a couple of years ago, we had a scandal
p114
aVwhich killed about 80 people around the world,
p115
aVbecause of contaminants
p116
aVthat crept into the heparin supply chain.
p117
aVWorse, some of the suppliers
p118
aVrealized that they could substitute a product
p119
aVwhich mimicked heparin in tests.
p120
aVThis substitute cost nine dollars a pound,
p121
aVwhereas real heparin, the real ingredient,
p122
aVcost 900 dollars a pound.
p123
aVA no-brainer.
p124
aVThe problem was that it killed more people.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd so you're asking yourself,
p127
aV"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
p128
aVallowed this to happen?
p129
aVHow did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs
p130
aVallow this to happen?"
p131
aVAnd the answer is quite simple:
p132
aVthe Chinese define these facilities
p133
aVas chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,
p134
aVso they don't audit them.
p135
aVAnd the USFDA
p136
aVhas a jurisdictional problem.
p137
aVThis is offshore.
p138
aVThey actually do conduct a few investigations overseas \u2014
p139
aVabout a dozen a year \u2014 maybe 20 in a good year.
p140
aVThere are 500
p141
aVof these facilities
p142
aVproducing active ingredients in China alone.
p143
aVIn fact, about 80 percent
p144
aVof the active ingredients in medicines now
p145
aVcome from offshore,
p146
aVparticularly China and India,
p147
aVand we don't have a governance system.
p148
aVWe don't have a regulatory system
p149
aVable to ensure
p150
aVthat that production is safe.
p151
aVWe don't have a system to ensure
p152
aVthat human rights, basic dignity,
p153
aVare ensured.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo at a national level \u2014
p156
aVand we work in about 60 different countries \u2014
p157
aVat a national level
p158
aVwe've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments
p159
aVto regulate production
p160
aVon their own soil.
p161
aVAnd the real problem with the global supply chain
p162
aVis that it's supranational.
p163
aVSo governments who are failing,
p164
aVwho are dropping the ball
p165
aVat a national level,
p166
aVhave even less ability to get their arms around the problem
p167
aVat an international level.
p168
aVAnd you can just look at the headlines.
p169
aVTake Copenhagen last year \u2014
p170
aVcomplete failure of governments
p171
aVto do the right thing
p172
aVin the face of an international challenge.
p173
aVTake the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago \u2014
p174
aVstepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.
p175
aVYou can take any one
p176
aVof the major global challenges we've discussed this week
p177
aVand ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments
p178
aVto step up and come up with solutions,
p179
aVresponses,
p180
aVto those international problems?
p181
aVAnd the simple answer is they can't. They're national.
p182
aVTheir voters are local.
p183
aVThey have parochial interests.
p184
aVThey can't subordinate those interests
p185
aVto the greater global public good.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, if we're going to ensure the delivery
p188
aVof the key public goods
p189
aVat an international level \u2014
p190
aVin this case, in the global supply chain \u2014
p191
aVwe have to come up with a different mechanism.
p192
aVWe need a different machine.
p193
aVFortunately, we have some examples.
p194
aVIn the 1990s,
p195
aVthere were a whole series of scandals
p196
aVconcerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. \u2014
p197
aVchild labor, forced labor,
p198
aVserious health and safety abuses.
p199
aVAnd eventually President Clinton, in 1996,
p200
aVconvened a meeting at the White House,
p201
aVinvited industry, human rights NGOs,
p202
aVtrade unions, the Department of Labor,
p203
aVgot them all in a room
p204
aVand said, "Look,
p205
aVI don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.
p206
aVI don't know how to prevent that,
p207
aVbut I'm at least going to use my good offices
p208
aVto get you folks together
p209
aVto come up with a response."
p210
aVSo they formed a White House task force,
p211
aVand they spent about three years arguing
p212
aVabout who takes how much responsibility
p213
aVin the global supply chain.
p214
aVCompanies didn't feel it was their responsibility.
p215
aVThey don't own those facilities.
p216
aVThey don't employ those workers.
p217
aVThey're not legally liable.
p218
aVEverybody else at the table
p219
aVsaid, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.
p220
aVYou have a custodial duty, a duty of care,
p221
aVto make sure that that product
p222
aVgets from wherever to the store
p223
aVin a way that allows us to consume it,
p224
aVwithout fear of our safety,
p225
aVor without having to sacrifice our conscience
p226
aVto consume that product."
p227
aVSo they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do
p228
aVis we agree on a common set of standards,
p229
aVcode of conduct.
p230
aVWe'll apply that throughout
p231
aVour global supply chain
p232
aVregardless of ownership or control.
p233
aVWe'll make it part of the contract."
p234
aVAnd that was a stroke of absolute genius,
p235
aVbecause what they did
p236
aVwas they harnessed the power of the contract,
p237
aVprivate power,
p238
aVto deliver public goods.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd let's face it,
p241
aVthe contract from a major multinational brand
p242
aVto a supplier in India or China
p243
aVhas much more persuasive value
p244
aVthan the local labor law,
p245
aVthe local environmental regulations,
p246
aVthe local human rights standards.
p247
aVThose factories will probably never see an inspector.
p248
aVIf the inspector did come along,
p249
aVit would be amazing if they were able
p250
aVto resist the bribe.
p251
aVEven if they did their jobs,
p252
aVand they cited those facilities for their violations,
p253
aVthe fine would be derisory.
p254
aVBut you lose that contract
p255
aVfor a major brand name,
p256
aVthat's the difference
p257
aVbetween staying in business or going bankrupt.
p258
aVThat makes a difference.
p259
aVSo what we've been able to do
p260
aVis we've been able to harness
p261
aVthe power and the influence
p262
aVof the only truly transnational institution
p263
aVin the global supply chain,
p264
aVthat of the multinational company,
p265
aVand get them to do the right thing,
p266
aVget them to use that power for good,
p267
aVto deliver the key public goods.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow of course, this doesn't come naturally
p270
aVto multinational companies.
p271
aVThey weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.
p272
aVBut they are extremely efficient organizations.
p273
aVThey have resources,
p274
aVand if we can add the will, the commitment,
p275
aVthey know how to deliver that product.
p276
aVNow, getting there is not easy.
p277
aVThose supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,
p278
aVthey're not there.
p279
aVYou need a safe space.
p280
aVYou need a place where people can come together,
p281
aVsit down without fear of judgment,
p282
aVwithout recrimination,
p283
aVto actually face the problem,
p284
aVagree on the problem and come up with solutions.
p285
aVWe can do it. The technical solutions are there.
p286
aVThe problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,
p287
aVthe lack of partnership
p288
aVbetween NGOs, campaign groups,
p289
aVcivil society organizations
p290
aVand multinational companies.
p291
aVIf we can put those two together in a safe space,
p292
aVget them to work together,
p293
aVwe can deliver public goods right now,
p294
aVor in extremely short supply.
p295
aa(lp296
VThis is a radical proposition,
p297
aVand it's crazy to think
p298
aVthat if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl
p299
aVleaving your rural village
p300
aVto go and work in a factory in Dhaka \u2014
p301
aV22, 23, 24 dollars a month \u2014
p302
aVyour best chance of enjoying rights at work
p303
aVis if that factory is producing
p304
aVfor a brand name company
p305
aVwhich has got a code of conduct
p306
aVand made that code of conduct part of the contract.
p307
aVIt's crazy.
p308
aVMultinationals are protecting human rights.
p309
aVI know there's going to be disbelief.
p310
aVYou'll say, "How can we trust them?"
p311
aVWell, we don't.
p312
aVIt's the old arms control phrase:
p313
aV"Trust, but verify."
p314
aVSo we audit.
p315
aVWe take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,
p316
aVwe do a random sample,
p317
aVwe send inspectors on an unannounced basis
p318
aVto inspect those facilities,
p319
aVand then we publish the results.
p320
aVTransparency is absolutely critical to this.
p321
aVYou can call yourself responsible,
p322
aVbut responsibility without accountability
p323
aVoften doesn't work.
p324
aVSo what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,
p325
aVwe're giving them the tools to deliver this public good \u2014
p326
aVrespect for human rights \u2014
p327
aVand we're checking.
p328
aVYou don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.
p329
aVGo to the website. Look at the audit results.
p330
aVAsk yourself, is this company behaving
p331
aVin a socially responsible way?
p332
aVCan I buy that product
p333
aVwithout compromising my ethics?
p334
aVThat's the way the system works.
p335
aa(lp336
VI hate the idea
p337
aVthat governments are not protecting human rights around the world.
p338
aVI hate the idea
p339
aVthat governments have dropped this ball
p340
aVand I can't get used to the idea
p341
aVthat somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.
p342
aVI've been at this for 30 years,
p343
aVand in that time I've seen
p344
aVthe ability, the commitment, the will of government
p345
aVto do this decline,
p346
aVand I don't see them making a comeback right now.
p347
aVSo we started out thinking
p348
aVthis was a stopgap measure.
p349
aVWe're now thinking that, in fact,
p350
aVthis is probably the start
p351
aVof a new way of regulating and addressing
p352
aVinternational challenges.
p353
aVCall it network governance. Call it what you will.
p354
aVThe private actors,
p355
aVcompanies and NGOs,
p356
aVare going to have to get together
p357
aVto face the major challenges we are going to face.
p358
aVJust look at pandemics \u2014
p359
aVswine flu, bird flu, H1N1.
p360
aVLook at the health systems in so many countries.
p361
aVDo they have the resources
p362
aVto face up to a serious pandemic?
p363
aVNo.
p364
aVCould the private sector and NGOs
p365
aVget together and marshal a response?
p366
aVAbsolutely.
p367
aVWhat they lack is that safe space
p368
aVto come together, agree
p369
aVand move to action.
p370
aVThat's what we're trying to provide.
p371
aa(lp372
VI know as well
p373
aVthat this often seems
p374
aVlike an overwhelming level of responsibility
p375
aVfor people to assume.
p376
aV"You want me to deliver human rights
p377
aVthroughout my global supply chain.
p378
aVThere are thousands of suppliers in there."
p379
aVIt seems too daunting, too dangerous,
p380
aVfor any company to take on.
p381
aVBut there are companies.
p382
aVWe have 4,000 companies who are members.
p383
aVSome of them are very, very large companies.
p384
aVThe sporting goods industry, in particular,
p385
aVstepped up to the plate and have done it.
p386
aVThe example, the role model, is there.
p387
aVAnd whenever we discuss
p388
aVone of these problems that we have to address \u2014
p389
aVchild labor in cottonseed farms in India \u2014
p390
aVthis year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.
p391
aVIt seems overwhelming.
p392
aVThe numbers just make you want to zone out.
p393
aVBut we break it down to some basic realities.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd human rights
p396
aVcomes down to a very simple proposition:
p397
aVcan I give this person their dignity back?
p398
aVPoor people,
p399
aVpeople whose human rights have been violated \u2014
p400
aVthe crux of that
p401
aVis the loss of dignity,
p402
aVthe lack of dignity.
p403
aVIt starts with just giving people back their dignity.
p404
aVI was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon
p405
aVjust next to Delhi,
p406
aVone of the flashiest, brightest new cities
p407
aVpopping up in India right now,
p408
aVand I was talking to workers
p409
aVwho worked in garment sweatshops down the road,
p410
aVand I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.
p411
aVThey didn't say money.
p412
aVThey said, "The people who employ us
p413
aVtreat us like we are less than human,
p414
aVlike we don't exist.
p415
aVPlease ask them to treat us like human beings."
p416
aVThat's my simple understanding of human rights.
p417
aVThat's my simple proposition to you,
p418
aVmy simple plea to every decision-maker
p419
aVin this room, everybody out there.
p420
aVWe can all make a decision
p421
aVto come together
p422
aVand pick up the balls and run with the balls
p423
aVthat governments have dropped.
p424
aVIf we don't do it,
p425
aVwe're abandoning hope,
p426
aVwe're abandoning our essential humanity,
p427
aVand I know that's not a place we want to be,
p428
aVand we don't have to be there.
p429
aVSo I appeal to you.
p430
aVJoin us, come into that safe space,
p431
aVand let's start to make this happen.
p432
