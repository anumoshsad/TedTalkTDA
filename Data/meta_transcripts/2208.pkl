VHello.
p4
aVI'm a toy developer.
p5
aVWith a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before,
p6
aVI began working at a toy company nine years ago.
p7
aVWhen I first started working there,
p8
aVI proposed many new ideas to my boss every day.
p9
aVHowever, my boss always asked
p10
aVif I had the data to prove it would sell,
p11
aVand asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data.
p12
aVData, data, data.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product.
p15
aVHowever, I was unable to think of anything new at that moment.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVMy ideas were unoriginal.
p18
aVI wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking.
p19
aVIt was so hard that I became this skinny.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVIt's true. (Applause)
p22
aa(lp23
VYou've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too.
p24
aVYour boss was being difficult. The data was difficult.
p25
aVYou become sick of thinking.
p26
aVNow, I throw out the data.
p27
aVIt's my dream to create new toys.
p28
aVAnd now, instead of data,
p29
aVI'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas.
p30
aa(lp31
VI would like to introduce this method today.
p32
aVWhat is Shiritori?
p33
aVTake apple, elephant  and trumpet, for example.
p34
aVIt's a game where  you take turns saying words
p35
aVthat start with the last letter of the previous word.
p36
aVIt's the same in Japanese and English.
p37
aVYou can play Shiritori as you like:
p38
aV"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc. [Cat, cola, concert, brush]
p39
aVMany random words will come out.
p40
aVYou force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas.
p41
aVIn my case, for example, since I want to think of toys,
p42
aVwhat could a toy cat be?
p43
aVA cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place?
p44
aVHow about a toy with cola?
p45
aVA toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet?
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VRidiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing.
p49
aVThe more ideas you produce, you're sure to come up with some good ones, too.
p50
aVA brush, for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?
p51
aVWe could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and \u2014
p52
aV(Music noises) \u2014
p53
aVyou've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth.
p54
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p55
aVKids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it.
p56
aa(lp57
VCan we make a hat into a toy?
p58
aVHow about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one,
p59
aVand then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top
p60
aVscreaming, "Ahh!"
p61
aVI wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties?
p62
aa(lp63
VIdeas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out.
p64
aVActually, this bubble wrap, which is used to pack fragile objects,
p65
aVcombined with a toy, made Mugen Pop Pop,
p66
aVa toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like.
p67
aVIt was a big hit when it reached stores.
p68
aVData had nothing to do with its success.
p69
aVAlthough it's only popping bubbles,
p70
aVit's a great way to kill time,
p71
aVso please pass this around
p72
aVamongst yourselves today and play with it.
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VAnyway, you continue to come up with useless ideas.
p76
aVThink up many trivial ideas, everyone.
p77
aVIf you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for,
p78
aVyou'll end up trying too hard,
p79
aVand you can't produce new ideas.
p80
aVEven if you know what your aim is,
p81
aVthink of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed.
p82
aVIf you do this, you surely will hit somewhere near the center.
p83
aVAt least one will.
p84
aVThat's the one you should choose.
p85
aVIf you do so, that idea will be in demand
p86
aVand, moreover, it will be brand new.
p87
aVThat is how I think of new ideas.
p88
aa(lp89
VIt doesn't have to be Shiritori; there are many different methods.
p90
aVYou just have to choose words at random.
p91
aVYou can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random.
p92
aVFor example, you could look up two random letters and gather the results
p93
aVor go to the store and connect product names
p94
aVwith what you want to think of.
p95
aVThe point is to gather random words,
p96
aVnot information from the category you're thinking for.
p97
aVIf you do this, the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected
p98
aVand form connections that will produce many ideas.
p99
aVThe greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images.
p100
aVBecause you're thinking of one word after another,
p101
aVthe image of the previous word is still with you.
p102
aVThat image will automatically be related with future words.
p103
aVUnconsciously, a concert will be connected to a brush
p104
aVand a roulette game will be connected to a hat.
p105
aVYou wouldn't even realize it.
p106
aVYou can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis method is, of course, not just for toys.
p109
aVYou can collect ideas for books, apps, events, and many other projects.
p110
aVI hope you all try this method.
p111
aVThere are futures that are born from data.
p112
aVHowever, using this silly game called Shiritori,
p113
aVI look forward to the exciting future you will create,
p114
aVa future you couldn't even imagine.
p115
aa(lp116
