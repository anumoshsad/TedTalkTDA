VI love theater.
p4
aVI love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else
p5
aVand look at life with a completely new perspective.
p6
aVI love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
p7
aVThe idea that in that room at that moment,
p8
aVeveryone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,
p9
aVcomes together.
p10
aVAt that moment, we transcend space and time together.
p11
aVTheater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
p12
aVAnd our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.
p13
aVOur ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.
p14
aVI was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,
p15
aVand began developing "Upwake."
p16
aV"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,
p17
aVa modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,
p18
aVstuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
p19
aVI wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.
p20
aVAnd I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
p21
aVSo I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.
p22
aa(lp23
VIf Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,
p24
aVhe would have drawn three holes inside that box
p25
aVand told you your sheep was inside.
p26
aVBecause, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
p27
aVThis is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination
p28
aVfrom head to paper to screen to life.
p29
aVIn "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,
p30
aVclones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,
p31
aVsails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.
p32
aVI wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
p33
aVGo from one world to another in a second.
p34
aVI wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity
p35
aVand use metaphors to suggest ideas.
p36
aVAt the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.
p37
aVTechnology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions
p38
aVin high definition, live, on stage.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship
p41
aVbetween theater and technology.
p42
aVLet's start with technology.
p43
aV(Fuse blowing)
p44
aVAll right. Let's start with theater.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aV(Buzzing)
p47
aV(Click, click, bang)
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aVThank you.
p51
aa(lp52
V"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.
p53
aVI project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage
p54
aVwhich I interact with.
p55
aVThe use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
p56
aVI didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.
p57
aVThere are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.
p58
aVIt's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
p59
aVThree hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,
p60
aVwhat started as a one person show became a collaborative work
p61
aVof nineteen most talented artists.
p62
aVAnd here are some excerpts.
p63
aV(Applause)
p64
aVThank you.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.
p67
aVAnd in Austin, Texas,
p68
aVI was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.
p69
aVWhen I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:
p70
aVSix hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.
p71
aVI was a little nervous performing without animation, costume \u2014 really \u2014 and make-up.
p72
aVBut the teachers came to me afterward and told me
p73
aVthey hadn't seen the kids that attentive.
p74
aVAnd I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality
p75
aVin order to transport them into another.
p76
aVSomething happened along the way.
p77
aVZero became a person and not just a character in a play.
p78
aVZero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
p79
aVZero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,
p80
aVand Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.
p81
aa(lp82
VIt's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box
p83
aVas it is about taking theater out of its box.
p84
aVAs a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.
p85
aVAnd that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,
p86
aVthen people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
p87
aVIt's as though you made something resonate within them.
p88
aVIt's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting
p89
aVallows them to be themselves just a bit more.
p90
aVBecause through your mask, they let theirs go.
p91
aa(lp92
VBeing human is an art form.
p93
aVI know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,
p94
aVand I know theater can heal.
p95
aVI've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
p96
aVI have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors
p97
aVbe lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.
p98
aVI know theater unites us.
p99
aVZero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,
p100
aVtell various stories through different mediums.
p101
aa(lp102
VComic books. Quantum physics video games.
p103
aVAnd Zero wants to go to the moon.
p104
aVIn 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,
p105
aVsuggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity
p106
aVevery Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
p107
aVThe idea is simple, basic. It's not original,
p108
aVbut it's important, and it's important to participate.
p109
aa(lp110
VThere is a revolution.
p111
aVIt's a human and technological revolution.
p112
aVIt's motion and emotion.
p113
aVIt's information.
p114
aVIt's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
p115
aVIt's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
p116
aVIt's happening.
p117
aVThe natural progression of science and art
p118
aVfinding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
p119
aVThere is a revolution in the way that we think,
p120
aVin the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,
p121
aVour evolution.
p122
aVThis is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.
p123
aVCharlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures
p124
aVand told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
p125
aVHe was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.
p126
aVHe gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings
p127
aVwhen they needed it the most.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.
p130
aVIn the science of today, we become artists.
p131
aVIn the art of today, we become scientists.
p132
aVWe design our world. We invent possibilities.
p133
aVWe teach, touch and move.
p134
aVIt is now that we can use the diversity of our talents
p135
aVto create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.
p136
aV(Ringing)
p137
aVThank you.
