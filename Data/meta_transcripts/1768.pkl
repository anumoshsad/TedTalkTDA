VOnce upon a time
p4
aVwe lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.
p5
aVThis was called the Great Moderation,
p6
aVthe misguided belief by most economists,
p7
aVpolicymakers and central banks
p8
aVthat we have transformed into a new world
p9
aVof never-ending growth and prosperity.
p10
aVThis was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,
p11
aVby low and controlled inflation,
p12
aVby low unemployment,
p13
aVand controlled and low financial volatility.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,
p16
aVthe great crash, broke this illusion.
p17
aVA few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector
p18
aVcascaded into five trillion dollars
p19
aVof losses in world GDP
p20
aVand almost $30 trillion losses
p21
aVin the global stock market.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo the understanding of this Great Recession
p24
aVwas that this was completely surprising,
p25
aVthis came out of the blue,
p26
aVthis was like the wrath of the gods.
p27
aVThere was no responsibility.
p28
aVSo, as a reflection of this,
p29
aVwe started the Financial Crisis Observatory.
p30
aVWe had the goal to diagnose in real time
p31
aVfinancial bubbles
p32
aVand identify in advance their critical time.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhat is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?
p35
aVWe developed a theory called "dragon-kings."
p36
aVDragon-kings represent extreme events
p37
aVwhich are of a class of their own.
p38
aVThey are special. They are outliers.
p39
aVThey are generated by specific mechanisms
p40
aVthat may make them predictable,
p41
aVperhaps controllable.
p42
aa(lp43
VConsider the financial price time series,
p44
aVa given stock, your perfect stock,
p45
aVor a global index.
p46
aVYou have these up-and-downs.
p47
aVA very good measure of the risk of this financial market
p48
aVis the peaks-to-valleys that represent
p49
aVa worst case scenario
p50
aVwhen you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.
p51
aVYou can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence
p52
aVof peak-to-valleys of different sizes,
p53
aVwhich is represented in this graph.
p54
aVNow, interestingly, 99 percent
p55
aVof the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes
p56
aVcan be represented by a universal power law
p57
aVrepresented by this red line here.
p58
aVMore interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions
p59
aVwhich are above this red line,
p60
aVoccur 100 times more frequently, at least,
p61
aVthan the extrapolation would predict them to occur
p62
aVbased on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining
p63
aVpeak-to-valleys.
p64
aVThey are due to trenchant dependancies
p65
aVsuch that a loss is followed by a loss
p66
aVwhich is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.
p67
aVThese kinds of dependencies
p68
aVare largely missed by standard risk management tools,
p69
aVwhich ignore them and see lizards
p70
aVwhen they should see dragon-kings.
p71
aVThe root mechanism of a dragon-king
p72
aVis a slow maturation towards instability,
p73
aVwhich is the bubble,
p74
aVand the climax of the bubble is often the crash.
p75
aVThis is similar to the slow heating of water
p76
aVin this test tube reaching the boiling point,
p77
aVwhere the instability of the water occurs
p78
aVand you have the phase transition to vapor.
p79
aVAnd this process, which is absolutely non-linear \u2014
p80
aVcannot be predicted by standard techniques \u2014
p81
aVis the reflection of a collective emergent behavior
p82
aVwhich is fundamentally endogenous.
p83
aVSo the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis
p84
aVhas to be found in an inner instability of the system,
p85
aVand any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, some of you may have come to the mind
p88
aVthat is this not related to the black swan concept
p89
aVyou have heard about frequently?
p90
aVRemember, black swan is this rare bird
p91
aVthat you see once and suddenly shattered your belief
p92
aVthat all swans should be white,
p93
aVso it has captured the idea of unpredictability,
p94
aVunknowability, that the extreme events
p95
aVare fundamentally unknowable.
p96
aVNothing can be further
p97
aVfrom the dragon-king concept I propose,
p98
aVwhich is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events
p99
aVare actually knowable and predictable.
p100
aVSo we can be empowered and take responsibility
p101
aVand make predictions about them.
p102
aVSo let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VThere are many early warning signals
p107
aVthat are predicted by this theory.
p108
aVLet me just focus on one of them:
p109
aVthe super-exponential growth with positive feedback.
p110
aVWhat does it mean?
p111
aVImagine you have an investment
p112
aVthat returns the first year five percent,
p113
aVthe second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,
p114
aVthe next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?
p115
aVThis is a super-exponential growth.
p116
aVA standard exponential growth corresponds
p117
aVto a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent
p118
aVThe point is that, many times during bubbles,
p119
aVthere are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,
p120
aVsuch that previous growths enhance,
p121
aVpush forward, increase the next growth
p122
aVthrough this kind of super-exponential growth,
p123
aVwhich is very trenchant, not sustainable.
p124
aVAnd the key idea is that the mathematical solution
p125
aVof this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,
p126
aVwhich means that there is a critical time
p127
aVwhere the system will break, will change regime.
p128
aVIt may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.
p129
aVAnd the key idea is that the critical time,
p130
aVthe information about the critical time is contained
p131
aVin the early development of this super-exponential growth.
p132
aa(lp133
VWe have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,
p134
aVto the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements
p135
aVon the iron rocket.
p136
aVUsing acoustic emission, you know, this little noise
p137
aVthat you hear a structure emit, sing to you
p138
aVwhen they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,
p139
aVthere's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,
p140
aVthe more damage gives the more damage,
p141
aVso you can actually predict,
p142
aVwithin, of course, a probability band,
p143
aVwhen the rupture will occur.
p144
aVSo this is now so successful that it is used
p145
aVin the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.
p146
aa(lp147
VPerhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory
p148
aVapplies to biology and medicine,
p149
aVparturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.
p150
aVFrom seven months of pregnancy, a mother
p151
aVstarts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus
p152
aVthat are the sign of these maturations
p153
aVtoward the instability, giving birth to the baby,
p154
aVthe dragon-king.
p155
aVSo if you measure the precursor signal,
p156
aVyou can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems
p157
aVin advance.
p158
aVEpileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,
p159
aVand when the brain goes to a super-critical state,
p160
aVyou have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability
p161
aVand this can help the patient to deal with this illness.
p162
aVWe have applied this theory to many systems,
p163
aVlandslides, glacier collapse,
p164
aVeven to the dynamics of prediction of success:
p165
aVblockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.
p166
aVBut perhaps the most important application
p167
aVis for finance, and this theory
p168
aVilluminates, I believe, the deep reason
p169
aVfor the financial crisis that we have gone through.
p170
aVThis is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,
p171
aVstarting in 1980, with the global bubble
p172
aVcrashing in 1987,
p173
aVfollowed by many other bubbles.
p174
aVThe biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble
p175
aVin 2000, crashing in 2000,
p176
aVthe real estate bubbles in many countries,
p177
aVfinancial derivative bubbles everywhere,
p178
aVstock market bubbles also everywhere,
p179
aVcommodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles \u2014
p180
aVbubbles, bubbles, bubbles.
p181
aa(lp182
VWe had a global bubble.
p183
aVThis is a measure of global overvaluation
p184
aVof all markets, expressing what I call
p185
aVan illusion of a perpetual money machine
p186
aVthat suddenly broke in 2007.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe problem is that we see the same process,
p189
aVin particular through quantitative easing,
p190
aVof a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays
p191
aVto tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,
p192
aVin Japan.
p193
aVThis has very important implications
p194
aVto understand the failure of quantitative easing
p195
aVas well as austerity measures
p196
aVas long as we don't attack the core,
p197
aVthe structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, these are big claims.
p200
aVWhy would you believe me?
p201
aVWell, perhaps because, in the last 15 years
p202
aVwe have come out of our ivory tower,
p203
aVand started to publish ex ante \u2014
p204
aVand I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" \u2014
p205
aVbefore the crash confirmed
p206
aVthe existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.
p207
aVThese are a few of the major bubbles
p208
aVthat we have lived through in recent history.
p209
aVAgain, many interesting stories for each of them.
p210
aVLet me tell you just one or two stories
p211
aVthat deal with massive bubbles.
p212
aa(lp213
VWe all know the Chinese miracle.
p214
aVThis is the expression of the stock market
p215
aVof a massive bubble, a factor of three,
p216
aV300 percent in just a few years.
p217
aVIn September 2007,
p218
aVI was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund
p219
aVmanagement conference,
p220
aVand I showed to the conference a prediction
p221
aVthat by the end of 2007, this bubble
p222
aVwould change regime.
p223
aVThere might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.
p224
aVNow, how do you believe the very smart,
p225
aVvery motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers
p226
aVreacted to this prediction?
p227
aVYou know, they had made billions
p228
aVjust surfing this bubble until now.
p229
aVThey told me, "Didier,
p230
aVyeah, the market might be overvalued,
p231
aVbut you forget something.
p232
aVThere is the Beijing Olympic Games coming
p233
aVin August 2008, and it's very clear that
p234
aVthe Chinese government is controlling the economy
p235
aVand doing what it takes
p236
aVto also avoid any wave and control the stock market."
p237
aa(lp238
VThree weeks after my presentation,
p239
aVthe markets lost 20 percent
p240
aVand went through a phase of volatility,
p241
aVupheaval, and a total market loss of
p242
aV70 percent until the end of the year.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo how can we be so collectively wrong
p245
aVby misreading or ignoring the science
p246
aVof the fact that when an instability has developed,
p247
aVand the system is ripe, any perturbation
p248
aVmakes it essentially impossible to control?
p249
aa(lp250
VThe Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.
p251
aVIn 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,
p252
aVa smaller one, was unsustainable,
p253
aVso we published again a prediction, in advance,
p254
aVstating that by August 2009, the market will correct,
p255
aVwill not continue on this track.
p256
aVOur critics, reading the prediction,
p257
aVsaid, "No, it's not possible.
p258
aVThe Chinese government is there.
p259
aVThey have learned their lesson. They will control.
p260
aVThey want to benefit from the growth."
p261
aVPerhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.
p262
aVSo the crisis did occur. The market corrected.
p263
aa(lp264
VThe same critics then said, "Ah, yes,
p265
aVbut you published your prediction.
p266
aVYou influenced the market.
p267
aVIt was not a prediction."
p268
aa(lp269
VMaybe I am very powerful then.
p270
aVNow, this is interesting.
p271
aVIt shows that it's essentially impossible until now
p272
aVto develop a science of economics
p273
aVbecause we are sentient beings who anticipate
p274
aVand there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo we invented a new way of doing science.
p277
aVWe created the Financial Bubble Experiment.
p278
aVThe idea is the following. We monitor the markets.
p279
aVWe identify excesses, bubbles.
p280
aVWe do our work. We write a report
p281
aVin which we put our prediction of the critical time.
p282
aVWe don't release the report. It's kept secret.
p283
aVBut with modern encrypting techniques,
p284
aVwe have a hash, we publish a public key,
p285
aVand six months later, we release the report,
p286
aVand there is authentication.
p287
aVAnd all this is done on an international archive
p288
aVso that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.
p289
aa(lp290
VLet me tease you with a very recent analysis.
p291
aV17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,
p292
aVwe identified that the U.S. stock market
p293
aVwas on an unsustainable path
p294
aVand we released this on our website on the 21st of May
p295
aVthat there will be a change of regime.
p296
aVThe next day, the market started to change regime, course.
p297
aVThis is not a crash.
p298
aVThis is just the third or fourth act
p299
aVof a massive bubble in the making.
p300
aVScaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,
p301
aVwe see the same thing.
p302
aVWherever we look, it's observable:
p303
aVin the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,
p304
aVshowing these super-exponential trajectories
p305
aVcharacterizing an unsustainable path
p306
aVand announcing a phase transition.
p307
aVThis diagram on the right
p308
aVshows a very beautiful compilation of studies
p309
aVsuggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear \u2014 possibility
p310
aVfor a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo there are bubbles everywhere.
p313
aVFrom one side, this is exciting
p314
aVfor me, as a professor who chases bubbles
p315
aVand slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.
p316
aa(lp317
VBut can we really slay the dragons?
p318
aVVery recently, with collaborators,
p319
aVwe studied a dynamical system
p320
aVwhere you see the dragon-king as these big loops
p321
aVand we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times
p322
aVthat removed, when control is on, these dragons.
p323
aa(lp324
V"Gouverner, c'est prévoir."
p325
aVGoverning is the art of planning and predicting.
p326
aVBut is it not the case that this is probably
p327
aVone of the biggest gaps of mankind,
p328
aVwhich has the responsibility to steer
p329
aVour societies and our planet toward sustainability
p330
aVin the face of growing challenges and crises?
p331
aa(lp332
VBut the dragon-king theory gives hope.
p333
aVWe learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.
p334
aVIt is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises
p335
aVso that we can be prepared, we can take measures,
p336
aVwe can take responsibility,
p337
aVand so that never again will
p338
aVextremes and crises like the Great Recession
p339
aVor the European crisis take us by surprise.
