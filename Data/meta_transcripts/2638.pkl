VWhen I was six years old,
p4
aVI received my gifts.
p5
aVMy first grade teacher had this brilliant idea.
p6
aVShe wanted us to experience receiving gifts
p7
aVbut also learning the virtue of complimenting each other.
p8
aVSo she had all of us come to the front of the classroom,
p9
aVand she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner.
p10
aVAnd she said,
p11
aV"Why don't we just stand here and compliment each other?
p12
aVIf you hear your name called,
p13
aVgo and pick up your gift and sit down."
p14
aVWhat a wonderful idea, right?
p15
aVWhat could go wrong?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VWell, there were 40 of us to start with,
p20
aVand every time I heard someone's name called,
p21
aVI would give out the heartiest cheer.
p22
aVAnd then there were 20 people left,
p23
aVand 10 people left,
p24
aVand five left ...
p25
aVand three left.
p26
aVAnd I was one of them.
p27
aVAnd the compliments stopped.
p28
aVWell, at that moment, I was crying.
p29
aVAnd the teacher was freaking out.
p30
aVShe was like, "Hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?"
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V"No one? OK, why don't you go get your gift and sit down.
p35
aVSo behave next year \u2014
p36
aVsomeone might say something nice about you."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VWell, as I'm describing this you,
p41
aVyou probably know I remember this really well.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VBut I don't know who felt worse that day.
p46
aVWas it me or the teacher?
p47
aVShe must have realized that she turned a team-building event
p48
aVinto a public roast for three six-year-olds.
p49
aVAnd without the humor.
p50
aVYou know, when you see people get roasted on TV,
p51
aVit was funny.
p52
aVThere was nothing funny about that day.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo that was one version of me,
p55
aVand I would die to avoid being in that situation again \u2014
p56
aVto get rejected in public again.
p57
aVThat's one version.
p58
aVThen fast-forward eight years.
p59
aVBill Gates came to my hometown \u2014
p60
aVBeijing, China \u2014
p61
aVto speak,
p62
aVand I saw his message.
p63
aVI fell in love with that guy.
p64
aVI thought, wow, I know what I want to do now.
p65
aVThat night I wrote a letter to my family
p66
aVtelling them: "By age 25,
p67
aVI will build the biggest company in the world,
p68
aVand that company will buy Microsoft."
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VI totally embraced this idea of conquering the world \u2014
p73
aVdomination, right?
p74
aVAnd I didn't make this up, I did write that letter.
p75
aVAnd here it is \u2014
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VYou don't have to read this through \u2014
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VThis is also bad handwriting, but I did highlight some key words.
p84
aVYou get the idea.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VSo ...
p89
aVthat was another version of me:
p90
aVone who will conquer the world.
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, then two years later,
p93
aVI was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States.
p94
aVI jumped on it,
p95
aVbecause that was where Bill Gates lived, right?
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VI thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey.
p100
aVThen, fast-forward another 14 years.
p101
aVI was 30.
p102
aVNope, I didn't build that company.
p103
aVI didn't even start.
p104
aVI was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company.
p105
aVAnd I felt I was stuck;
p106
aVI was stagnant.
p107
aVWhy is that?
p108
aVWhere is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter?
p109
aVIt's not because he didn't try.
p110
aVIt's because every time I had a new idea,
p111
aVevery time I wanted to try something new,
p112
aVeven at work \u2014
p113
aVI wanted to make a proposal,
p114
aVI wanted to speak up in front of people in a group \u2014
p115
aVI felt there was this constant battle
p116
aVbetween the 14-year-old and the six-year-old.
p117
aVOne wanted to conquer the world \u2014
p118
aVmake a difference \u2014
p119
aVanother was afraid of rejection.
p120
aVAnd every time that six-year-old won.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd this fear even persisted after I started my own company.
p123
aVI mean, I started my own company when I was 30 \u2014
p124
aVif you want to be Bill Gates,
p125
aVyou've got to start sooner or later, right?
p126
aVWhen I was an entrepreneur,
p127
aVI was presented with an investment opportunity,
p128
aVand then I was turned down.
p129
aVAnd that rejection hurt me.
p130
aVIt hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there.
p131
aVBut then I thought,
p132
aVhey, would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection?
p133
aVWould any successful entrepreneur quit like that?
p134
aVNo way.
p135
aVAnd this is where it clicked for me.
p136
aVOK, I can build a better company.
p137
aVI can build a better team or better product,
p138
aVbut one thing for sure:
p139
aVI've got to be a better leader.
p140
aVI've got to be a better person.
p141
aVI cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore.
p142
aVI have to put him back in his place.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo this is where I went online and looked for help.
p145
aVGoogle was my friend.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VI searched, "How do I overcome the fear of rejection?"
p150
aVI came up with a bunch of psychology articles
p151
aVabout where the fear and pain are coming from.
p152
aVThen I came up with a bunch of "rah-rah" inspirational articles
p153
aVabout "Don't take it personally, just overcome it."
p154
aVWho doesn't know that?
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VBut why was I still so scared?
p159
aVThen I found this website by luck.
p160
aVIt's called rejectiontherapy.com.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
V"Rejection Therapy" was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.
p165
aVHis name is Jason Comely.
p166
aVAnd basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection,
p167
aVand every day get rejected at something,
p168
aVand then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain.
p169
aVAnd I loved that idea.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VI said, "You know what? I'm going to do this.
p174
aVAnd I'll feel myself getting rejected 100 days."
p175
aVAnd I came up with my own rejection ideas,
p176
aVand I made a video blog out of it.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd so here's what I did.
p179
aVThis is what the blog looked like.
p180
aVDay One ...
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VBorrow 100 dollars from a stranger.
p185
aVSo this is where I went to where I was working.
p186
aVI came downstairs
p187
aVand I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk.
p188
aVHe looked like a security guard.
p189
aVSo I just approached him.
p190
aVAnd I was just walking
p191
aVand that was the longest walk of my life \u2014
p192
aVhair on the back of my neck standing up,
p193
aVI was sweating and my heart was pounding.
p194
aVAnd I got there and said,
p195
aV"Hey, sir, can I borrow 100 dollars from you?"
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd he looked up, he's like, "No."
p200
aV"Why?"
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd I just said, "No? I'm sorry."
p203
aVThen I turned around, and I just ran.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VI felt so embarrassed.
p208
aVBut because I filmed myself \u2014
p209
aVso that night I was watching myself getting rejected,
p210
aVI just saw how scared I was.
p211
aVI looked like this kid in "The Sixth Sense."
p212
aVI saw dead people.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VBut then I saw this guy.
p217
aVYou know, he wasn't that menacing.
p218
aVHe was a chubby, loveable guy,
p219
aVand he even asked me, "Why?"
p220
aVIn fact, he invited me to explain myself.
p221
aVAnd I could've said many things.
p222
aVI could've explained, I could've negotiated.
p223
aVI didn't do any of that.
p224
aVAll I did was run.
p225
aVI felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life.
p226
aVEvery time I felt the slightest rejection,
p227
aVI would just run as fast as I could.
p228
aVAnd you know what?
p229
aVThe next day, no matter what happens,
p230
aVI'm not going to run.
p231
aVI'll stay engaged.
p232
aa(lp233
VDay Two: Request a "burger refill."
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VIt's when I went to a burger joint,
p238
aVI finished lunch, and I went to the cashier and said,
p239
aV"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VHe was all confused, like, "What's a burger refill?"
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VI said, "Well, it's just like a drink refill but with a burger."
p248
aVAnd he said, "Sorry, we don't do burger refill, man."
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VSo this is where rejection happened and I could have run, but I stayed.
p253
aVI said, "Well, I love your burgers,
p254
aVI love your joint,
p255
aVand if you guys do a burger refill,
p256
aVI will love you guys more."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd he said, "Well, OK, I'll tell my manager about it,
p261
aVand maybe we'll do it, but sorry, we can't do this today."
p262
aVThen I left.
p263
aVAnd by the way,
p264
aVI don't think they've ever done burger refill.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VI think they're still there.
p269
aVBut the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time
p270
aVwas no longer there,
p271
aVjust because I stayed engaged \u2014
p272
aVbecause I didn't run.
p273
aVI said, "Wow, great, I'm already learning things.
p274
aVGreat."
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd then Day Three: Getting Olympic Doughnuts.
p277
aVThis is where my life was turned upside down.
p278
aVI went to a Krispy Kreme.
p279
aVIt's a doughnut shop
p280
aVin mainly the Southeastern part of the United States.
p281
aVI'm sure they have some here, too.
p282
aVAnd I went in,
p283
aVI said, "Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols?
p284
aVBasically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... "
p285
aVI mean there's no way they could say yes, right?
p286
aVThe doughnut maker took me so seriously.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VSo she put out paper,
p291
aVstarted jotting down the colors and the rings,
p292
aVand is like, "How can I make this?"
p293
aVAnd then 15 minutes later,
p294
aVshe came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings.
p295
aVAnd I was so touched.
p296
aVI just couldn't believe it.
p297
aVAnd that video got over five million views on Youtube.
p298
aVThe world couldn't believe that either.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VYou know, because of that I was in newspapers,
p303
aVin talk shows, in everything.
p304
aVAnd I became famous.
p305
aVA lot of people started writing emails to me
p306
aVand saying, "What you're doing is awesome."
p307
aVBut you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me.
p308
aVWhat I really wanted to do was learn,
p309
aVand to change myself.
p310
aVSo I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection
p311
aVinto this playground \u2014
p312
aVinto this research project.
p313
aVI wanted to see what I could learn.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd then I learned a lot of things.
p316
aVI discovered so many secrets.
p317
aVFor example, I found if I just don't run,
p318
aVif I got rejected,
p319
aVI could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,"
p320
aVand the magic word is, "why."
p321
aa(lp322
VSo one day I went to a stranger's house, I had this flower in my hand,
p323
aVknocked on the door and said,
p324
aV"Hey, can I plant this flower in your backyard?"
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd he said, "No."
p329
aVBut before he could leave I said,
p330
aV"Hey, can I know why?"
p331
aVAnd he said, "Well, I have this dog
p332
aVthat would dig up anything I put in the backyard.
p333
aVI don't want to waste your flower.
p334
aVIf you want to do this, go across the street and talk to Connie.
p335
aVShe loves flowers."
p336
aVSo that's what I did.
p337
aVI went across and knocked on Connie's door.
p338
aVAnd she was so happy to see me.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd then half an hour later,
p343
aVthere was this flower in Connie's backyard.
p344
aVI'm sure it looks better now.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VBut had I left after the initial rejection,
p349
aVI would've thought,
p350
aVwell, it's because the guy didn't trust me,
p351
aVit's because I was crazy,
p352
aVbecause I didn't dress up well, I didn't look good.
p353
aVIt was none of those.
p354
aVIt was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted.
p355
aVAnd he trusted me enough to offer me a referral,
p356
aVusing a sales term.
p357
aVI converted a referral.
p358
aa(lp359
VThen one day \u2014
p360
aVand I also learned that I can actually say certain things
p361
aVand maximize my chance to get a yes.
p362
aVSo for example, one day I went to a Starbucks,
p363
aVand asked the manager, "Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"
p364
aVHe was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?"
p365
aVI said, "Do you know those Walmart greeters?
p366
aVYou know, those people who say 'hi' to you before you walk in the store,
p367
aVand make sure you don't steal stuff, basically?
p368
aVI want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers."
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VWell, I'm not sure that's a good thing, actually \u2014
p373
aVActually, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing.
p374
aVAnd he was like, "Oh" \u2014
p375
aVyeah, this is how he looked, his name is Eric \u2014
p376
aVand he was like, "I'm not sure."
p377
aVThis is how he was hearing me. "Not sure."
p378
aVThen I ask him, "Is that weird?"
p379
aVHe's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man."
p380
aVBut as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed.
p381
aVIt's as if he's putting all the doubt on the floor.
p382
aVAnd he said, "Yeah, you can do this,
p383
aVjust don't get too weird."
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VSo for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter.
p388
aVI said "hi" to every customer that walked in,
p389
aVand gave them holiday cheers.
p390
aVBy the way, I don't know what your career trajectory is,
p391
aVdon't be a greeter.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VIt was really boring.
p396
aVBut then I found I could do this because I mentioned, "Is that weird?"
p397
aVI mentioned the doubt that he was having.
p398
aVAnd because I mentioned, "Is that weird?", that means I wasn't weird.
p399
aVThat means I was actually thinking just like him,
p400
aVseeing this as a weird thing.
p401
aVAnd again, and again,
p402
aVI learned that if I mention some doubt people might have
p403
aVbefore I ask the question,
p404
aVI gained their trust.
p405
aVPeople were more likely to say yes to me.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
p408
aVby asking.
p409
aVYou know, I came from four generations of teachers,
p410
aVand my grandma has always told me,
p411
aV"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,
p412
aVbut it'd be great if you became a teacher."
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VBut I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I didn't.
p417
aVBut it has always been my dream to actually teach something.
p418
aVSo I said, "What if I just ask
p419
aVand teach a college class?"
p420
aVI lived in Austin at the time,
p421
aVso I went to University of Texas at Austin
p422
aVand knocked on professors' doors and said, "Can I teach your class?"
p423
aVI didn't get anywhere the first couple of times.
p424
aVBut because I didn't run \u2014 I kept doing it \u2014
p425
aVand on the third try the professor was very impressed.
p426
aVHe was like, "No one has done this before."
p427
aVAnd I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson.
p428
aVHe said, "Wow, I can use this.
p429
aVWhy don't you come back in two months? I'll fit you in my curriculum."
p430
aVAnd two months later I was teaching a class.
p431
aa(lp432
VThis is me \u2014 you probably can't see, this is a bad picture.
p433
aVYou know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know?
p434
aa(lp435
V(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VBut wow \u2014
p438
aVwhen I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying,
p439
aVbecause I thought
p440
aVI could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking.
p441
aVI used to think I have to accomplish all these things \u2014
p442
aVhave to be a great entrepreneur, or get a PhD to teach \u2014
p443
aVbut no, I just asked,
p444
aVand I could teach.
p445
aa(lp446
VAnd in that picture, which you can't see,
p447
aVI quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.
p448
aVWhy? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world,
p449
aVwho change the way we live and the way we think,
p450
aVare the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections.
p451
aVPeople like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
p452
aVlike Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,
p453
aVor even Jesus Christ.
p454
aVThese people did not let rejection define them.
p455
aVThey let their own reaction after rejection define themselves.
p456
aVAnd they embraced rejection.
p457
aa(lp458
VAnd we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection,
p459
aVand in my case,
p460
aVrejection was my curse,
p461
aVwas my boogeyman.
p462
aVIt has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it.
p463
aVThen I started embracing it.
p464
aVI turned that into the biggest gift in my life.
p465
aVI started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities.
p466
aVI use my blog, I use my talk,
p467
aVI use the book I just published,
p468
aVand I'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection.
p469
aa(lp470
VWhen you get rejected in life,
p471
aVwhen you are facing the next obstacle
p472
aVor next failure,
p473
aVconsider the possibilities.
p474
aVDon't run.
p475
aVIf you just embrace them,
p476
aVthey might become your gifts as well.
p477
aa(lp478
VThank you.
