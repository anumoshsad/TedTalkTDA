VSo I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo
p4
aVand Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.
p5
aVWater and electricity supply are as unpredictable
p6
aVas the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,
p7
aVat the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends
p8
aVof mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.
p9
aVThe Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.
p10
aVSo as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,
p11
aV"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can
p12
aVjust put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"
p13
aVAnd I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I went home, and I did a little research,
p16
aVand I found some very shocking statistics.
p17
aVOver 2.5 billion people in the world today
p18
aVdo not have proper access to water and sanitation.
p19
aVFour hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,
p20
aVand five million of them are in South Africa.
p21
aVVarious diseases thrive in this environment,
p22
aVthe most drastic of which is called trachoma.
p23
aVTrachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt
p24
aVgetting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma
p25
aVcan leave you permanently blind.
p26
aVThe disease leaves eight million people permanently blind
p27
aVeach and every year. The shocking part about it
p28
aVis that to avoid being infected with trachoma,
p29
aVall you have to do is wash your face:
p30
aVno medicine, no pills, no injections.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,
p33
aV"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself
p34
aVand the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need
p35
aVto do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)
p36
aVSo with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone \u2014
p37
aVI didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,
p38
aVexcept for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe \u2014
p39
aVI did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,
p40
aVcreams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities \u2014
p41
aVI did high school science \u2014
p42
aVand I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,
p43
aVand it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.
p46
aVNow we need to get this thing into practice.
p47
aVFast forward four years later, after having written
p48
aVa 40-page business plan on the cell phone,
p49
aVhaving written my patent on the cell phone,
p50
aVI'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,
p51
aVand \u2014 ("No more bathing!") \u2014
p52
aVI can't say any more than that. (Laughter)
p53
aVI had invented DryBath, the world's first
p54
aVbath-substituting lotion.
p55
aVYou literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VSo after having tried to make it work in high school
p59
aVwith the limited resources I had, I went to university,
p60
aVmet a few people, got it into practice,
p61
aVand we have a fully functioning product that's ready
p62
aVto go to the market. It's actually available on the market.
p63
aVSo we learned a few lessons in commercializing
p64
aVand making DryBath available.
p65
aVOne of the things we learned was that poor communities
p66
aVdon't buy products in bulk.
p67
aVThey buy products on demand. A person in Alex
p68
aVdoesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette
p69
aVeach day, even though it's more expensive.
p70
aVSo we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.
p71
aVYou just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.
p72
aVAnd the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath
p73
aVfor five rand.
p74
aVAfter creating that model, we also learned a lot
p75
aVin terms of implementing the product.
p76
aVWe realized that even rich kids from the suburbs
p77
aVreally want DryBath. (Laughter)
p78
aVAt least once a week.
p79
aVAnyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters
p80
aVof water on average each time they skipped a bath,
p81
aVand also we would save two hours a day for kids
p82
aVwho are in rural areas, two hours more for school,
p83
aVtwo hours more for homework,
p84
aVtwo hours more to just be a kid.
p85
aa(lp86
VAfter seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down
p87
aVto our key value proposition,
p88
aVwhich was cleanliness and convenience.
p89
aVDryBath is a rich man's convenience
p90
aVand a poor man's lifesaver.
p91
aa(lp92
VHaving put the product into practice, we are actually now
p93
aVon the verge of selling the product
p94
aVonto a multinational to take it to the retail market,
p95
aVand one question I have for the audience today is,
p96
aVon the gravel roads of Limpopo,
p97
aVwith an allowance of 50 rand a week,
p98
aVI came up with a way for the world not to bathe.
p99
aVWhat's stopping you? (Applause)
p100
aVI'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.
p101
aVAnd another key thing that I learned a lot
p102
aVthroughout this whole process,
p103
aVlast year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.
p104
aVI'm also currently the best student entrepreneur
p105
aVin the world, the first African to get that accolade,
p106
aVand one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this
p107
aVjust because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.
p108
aV(Applause.)
