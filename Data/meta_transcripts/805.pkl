VOne day, Los Angeles Times columnist
p4
aVSteve Lopez was walking along
p5
aVthe streets of downtown Los Angeles
p6
aVwhen he heard beautiful music.
p7
aVAnd the source was a man,
p8
aVan African-American man,
p9
aVcharming, rugged, homeless,
p10
aVplaying a violin that only had two strings.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd I'm telling a story that many of you know,
p13
aVbecause Steve's columns became the basis
p14
aVfor a book, which was turned into a movie,
p15
aVwith Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,
p16
aVand Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,
p17
aVthe Juilliard-trained double bassist
p18
aVwhose promising career was cut short
p19
aVby a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
p20
aVNathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,
p21
aVand 30 years later he was living homeless
p22
aVon the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
p23
aVI encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie
p24
aVto understand not only the beautiful bond
p25
aVthat formed between these two men,
p26
aVbut how music helped shape that bond,
p27
aVand ultimately was instrumental \u2014 if you'll pardon the pun \u2014
p28
aVin helping Nathaniel get off the streets.
p29
aa(lp30
VI met Mr. Ayers in 2008,
p31
aVtwo years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
p32
aVHe had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,
p33
aVand came backstage and introduced himself.
p34
aVHe was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way
p35
aVabout Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton
p36
aVand how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,
p37
aVall because of the treacherous first violin passage work
p38
aVin the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.
p39
aVAnd we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later
p40
aVsaying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment
p43
aVbecause when he was treated it was with shock therapy
p44
aVand Thorazine and handcuffs,
p45
aVand that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.
p46
aVBut as a result now, he is prone to
p47
aVthese schizophrenic episodes,
p48
aVthe worst of which can manifest themselves as
p49
aVhim exploding
p50
aVand then disappearing for days,
p51
aVwandering the streets of Skid Row,
p52
aVexposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind
p53
aVunleashed upon him.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation
p56
aVwhen we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014
p57
aVhe had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,
p58
aVhe was lost.
p59
aVAnd he was talking about
p60
aVinvisible demons and smoke,
p61
aVand how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd I was afraid,
p64
aVnot for myself, but I was afraid
p65
aVthat I was going to lose him,
p66
aVthat he was going to sink into one of his states,
p67
aVand that I would ruin his relationship with the violin
p68
aVif I started talking about scales
p69
aVand arpeggios and other exciting forms of
p70
aVdidactic violin pedagogy.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVSo, I just started playing.
p73
aVAnd I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd as I played,
p76
aVI understood that there was a profound change
p77
aVoccurring in Nathaniel's eyes.
p78
aVIt was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,
p79
aVa chemical reaction, for which my playing the music
p80
aVwas its catalyst.
p81
aVAnd Nathaniel's manic rage
p82
aVwas transformed into understanding,
p83
aVa quiet curiosity and grace.
p84
aVAnd in a miracle, he lifted his own violin
p85
aVand he started playing, by ear,
p86
aVcertain snippets of violin concertos
p87
aVwhich he then asked me to complete \u2014 Mendelssohn,
p88
aVTchaikovsky, Sibelius.
p89
aVAnd we started talking about music, from Bach
p90
aVto Beethoven and Brahms,
p91
aVBruckner, all the B's,
p92
aVfrom Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd I understood that he not only
p95
aVhad an encyclopedic knowledge of music,
p96
aVbut he related to this music at a personal level.
p97
aVHe spoke about it with the kind of passion
p98
aVand understanding that I share with my colleagues
p99
aVin the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
p100
aVAnd through playing music and talking about music,
p101
aVthis man had transformed
p102
aVfrom the paranoid, disturbed man
p103
aVthat had just come from walking the streets
p104
aVof downtown Los Angeles
p105
aVto the charming, erudite,
p106
aVbrilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.
p107
aa(lp108
VMusic is medicine. Music changes us.
p109
aVAnd for Nathaniel, music is sanity.
p110
aVBecause music allows him to take his thoughts
p111
aVand delusions and shape them
p112
aVthrough his imagination and his creativity,
p113
aVinto reality.
p114
aVAnd that is an escape
p115
aVfrom his tormented state.
p116
aVAnd I understood that this was the very essence of art.
p117
aVThis was the very reason why we made music,
p118
aVthat we take something that exists within all of us
p119
aVat our very fundamental core,
p120
aVour emotions,
p121
aVand through our artistic lens,
p122
aVthrough our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.
p123
aVAnd the reality of that expression
p124
aVreaches all of us
p125
aVand moves us, inspires and unites us.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd for Nathaniel,
p128
aVmusic brought him back into a fold of friends.
p129
aVThe redemptive power of music brought him back
p130
aVinto a family of musicians
p131
aVthat understood him,
p132
aVthat recognized his talents
p133
aVand respected him.
p134
aVAnd I will always make music with Nathaniel,
p135
aVwhether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall
p136
aVor on Skid Row, because he reminds me
p137
aVwhy I became a musician.
p138
aVThank you.
p139
aV(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VBruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.

p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VRobert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.
p146
aVSo, please forgive me.
