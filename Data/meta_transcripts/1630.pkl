VI've been a journalist now since I was about 17,
p4
aVand it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,
p5
aVbecause as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval
p6
aVgoing on in media, and most of you probably know this
p7
aVfrom the business angle, which is that the business model
p8
aVis pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,
p9
aVthe profits have all been gobbled up by Google.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,
p12
aVbut the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.
p13
aVIt's on the input side. It's concern with
p14
aVhow we get information and how we gather the news.
p15
aVAnd that's changed, because we've had a huge shift
p16
aVin the balance of power from
p17
aVthe news organizations to the audience.
p18
aVAnd the audience for such a long time was in a position
p19
aVwhere they didn't have any way of affecting news
p20
aVor making any change. They couldn't really connect.
p21
aVAnd that's changed irrevocably.
p22
aa(lp23
VMy first connection with the news media was
p24
aVin 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.
p25
aVI wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons.
p26
aVSo I wrote a letter.
p27
aVAnd it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail:
p28
aV"Love Markham, Aged 4." Still works.
p29
aVI'm not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,
p30
aVbut what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.
p31
aVAnd that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone
p32
aVto have any impact and get some feedback.
p33
aVAnd that's changed now because, as journalists,
p34
aVwe interact in real time. We're not in a position
p35
aVwhere the audience is reacting to news.
p36
aVWe're reacting to the audience, and we're actually relying on them.
p37
aVThey're helping us find the news. They're helping us
p38
aVfigure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.
p39
aVSo it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening
p40
aVon a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.
p41
aa(lp42
VTo give an example of how we rely on the audience,
p43
aVon the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
p44
aVIt was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
p45
aVAnd 60 seconds is the amount of time it took
p46
aVfor it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
p47
aVSo the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.
p48
aVThirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,
p49
aVand this was someone saying "temblor," which means earthquake.
p50
aVSo 60 seconds was how long it took
p51
aVfor the physical earthquake to travel.
p52
aVThirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled
p53
aVall around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,
p54
aVhypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquake
p55
aVwas happening in Managua.
p56
aVAnd that happened because this one person had
p57
aVa documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,
p58
aVwhich is what we all do now, so if something happens,
p59
aVwe put our status update, or we post a photo,
p60
aVwe post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd what that means is just constant,
p63
aVhuge volumes of data going up.
p64
aVIt's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,
p65
aVevery minute there are 72 more hours
p66
aVof video on YouTube.
p67
aVSo that's, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.
p68
aVAnd in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.
p69
aVMore than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.
p70
aVSo by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864
p71
aVmore hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,
p72
aVand two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist,
p75
aVbecause we should have access to everything.
p76
aVAny event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about it
p77
aVpretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.
p78
aVAnd that goes for every single person in this room.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe only problem is, when you have that much information,
p81
aVyou have to find the good stuff, and that can be
p82
aVincredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes.
p83
aVAnd nowhere was this brought home more than during
p84
aVHurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was
p85
aVa superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time,
p86
aVhitting the iPhone capital of the universe \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p87
aVand you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before.
p88
aVAnd that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,
p89
aVso we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.
p90
aVWe had to deal with composite images
p91
aVthat were merging photos from previous storms.
p92
aVWe had to deal with images from films like "The Day After Tomorrow." (Laughter)
p93
aVAnd we had to deal with images that were so realistic
p94
aVit was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VBut joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram
p98
aVwhich was subjected to a grilling by journalists.
p99
aVThey weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.
p100
aVThe lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.
p101
aVAnd it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C
p102
aVin downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.
p103
aVAnd the reason that they could tell that it was real
p104
aVwas because they could get to the source, and in this case,
p105
aVthese guys were New York food bloggers.
p106
aVThey were well respected. They were known.
p107
aVSo this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.
p108
aVAnd that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.
p109
aVAnd you were, instead of going and finding the information
p110
aVand bringing it back to the reader, you were holding back
p111
aVthe stuff that was potentially damaging.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd finding the source becomes more and more important \u2014
p114
aVfinding the good source \u2014 and Twitter is where most journalists now go.
p115
aVIt's like the de facto real-time newswire,
p116
aVif you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd a good example of how useful it can be
p119
aVbut also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
p120
aVAs a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking
p121
aVfrom the outside, from Dublin,
p122
aVTwitter lists, and lists of good sources,
p123
aVpeople we could establish were credible, were really important.
p124
aVAnd how do you build a list like that from scratch?
p125
aVWell, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.
p126
aVThis visualization was done by an Italian academic.
p127
aVHe's called André Pannison, and he basically
p128
aVtook the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square
p129
aVon the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,
p130
aVand the dots you can see are retweets, so when someone
p131
aVretweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,
p132
aVand the more times that message is retweeted by other people,
p133
aVthe more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.
p134
aVAnd it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,
p135
aVbut what you get is hints at who is more interesting
p136
aVand who is worth investigating.
p137
aVAnd as the conversation grew and grew, it became
p138
aVmore and more lively, and eventually you were left
p139
aVwith this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.
p140
aVYou could find the nodes, though, and then you went,
p141
aVand you go, "Right, I've got to investigate these people.
p142
aVThese are the ones that are obviously making sense.
p143
aVLet's see who they are."
p144
aa(lp145
VNow in the deluge of information, this is where
p146
aVthe real-time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself,
p147
aVbecause we have more tools than ever
p148
aVto do that kind of investigation.
p149
aVAnd when you start digging into the sources, you can go
p150
aVfurther and further than you ever could before.
p151
aa(lp152
VSometimes you come across a piece of content that
p153
aVis so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it,
p154
aVbut you're not 100 percent sure if you can because
p155
aVyou don't know if the source is credible.
p156
aVYou don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload.
p157
aVAnd you have to do that investigative work.
p158
aVAnd this video, which I'm going to let run through,
p159
aVwas one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.
p160
aa(lp161
VVideo: Getting real windy in just a second.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Rain and wind sounds)
p164
aa(lp165
V(Explosion) Oh, shit!
p166
aa(lp167
VMarkham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something
p168
aVyou'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.
p169
aVYou know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,
p170
aVvery genuine video that they've shot in their back garden.
p171
aVBut how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked,
p172
aVor if it's something that's old and that's been reposted?
p173
aa(lp174
VSo we set about going to work on this video, and
p175
aVthe only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.
p176
aVThere was only one video posted to that account,
p177
aVand the username was Rita Krill.
p178
aVAnd we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.
p179
aVBut we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.
p180
aVThe first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.
p181
aVSo we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,
p182
aVwe found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.
p183
aVSo we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool
p184
aVcalled Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports
p185
aVfor the day in which this video had been uploaded,
p186
aVand when we went through all those various cities,
p187
aVwe found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.
p188
aVSo we went to the white pages, and we found,
p189
aVwe looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,
p190
aVand we looked through a couple of different addresses,
p191
aVand that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.
p192
aVAnd we found a house with a swimming pool that looked
p193
aVremarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video,
p194
aVand we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
p195
aVSo if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella,
p196
aVthere's a white lilo in the pool,
p197
aVthere are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,
p198
aVand there's two trees in the background.
p199
aVAnd we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,
p200
aVand sure enough, there's the white lilo,
p201
aVthere are the two trees,
p202
aVthere's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.
p203
aVLittle bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.
p204
aVSo we were able to call Rita, clear the video,
p205
aVmake sure that it had been shot, and then our clients
p206
aVwere delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
p207
aa(lp208
VSometimes the search for truth, though,
p209
aVis a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.
p210
aVSyria has been really interesting for us, because obviously
p211
aVa lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be
p212
aVpotentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube
p213
aVactually becomes the most important repository
p214
aVof information about what's going on in the world.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing,
p217
aVbecause it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.
p218
aVThis is from Hama.
p219
aVVideo: (Shouting)
p220
aVAnd what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,
p221
aVis bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck
p222
aVand thrown off a bridge.
p223
aVThe allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood
p224
aVand they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies
p225
aVoff the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,
p226
aVand there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,
p227
aVand whether or not they were what the video said it was.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been
p230
aVback and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,
p231
aVand the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.
p232
aVThree different sources said three different things about the bridge.
p233
aVThey said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.
p234
aVAnother one said the bridge does exist, but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else.
p235
aVAnd the third one said, "I think the bridge does exist,
p236
aVbut the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,
p237
aVso the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn't make sense."
p238
aVSo that was the only one that gave us a clue.
p239
aVWe looked through the video for other clues.
p240
aVWe saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.
p241
aVWe looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,
p242
aVso we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
p243
aVIt had black-and-white curbs.
p244
aVAs we looked at the river itself, you could see there's
p245
aVa concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood.
p246
aVThat's blood in the river. So the river is flowing
p247
aVsouth to north. That's what that tells me.
p248
aVAnd also, as you look away from the bridge,
p249
aVthere's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,
p250
aVand the river narrows.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo onto Google Maps we go, and we start
p253
aVlooking through literally every single bridge.
p254
aVWe go to the dam that we talked about, we start just
p255
aVliterally going through every time that road crosses the river,
p256
aVcrossing off the bridges that don't match.
p257
aVWe're looking for one that crosses east-west.
p258
aVAnd we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam
p259
aVto Hama and there's no bridge.
p260
aVSo we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,
p261
aVand we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.
p262
aVThe bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.
p263
aVSo this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.
p264
aVWe start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.
p265
aVAnd it's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,
p266
aVand as we click through it, you can see someone's
p267
aVuploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,
p268
aVso we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us
p269
aVmore detail that we can cross-reference with the video.
p270
aVThe first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,
p271
aVwhich is handy because we've seen that before.
p272
aVWe see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys
p273
aVthrowing the bodies over.
p274
aVAnd we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo what does that tell me? I've got to go back now
p277
aVto my three sources and look at what they told me:
p278
aVthe one who said the bridge didn't exist,
p279
aVthe one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama,
p280
aVand the one guy who said, "Yes, the bridge does exist, but I'm not sure about the water levels."
p281
aVNumber three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,
p282
aVand we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools
p283
aVsitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin
p284
aVin the space of 20 minutes.
p285
aVAnd that's part of the joy of this. Although the web
p286
aVis running like a torrent, there's so much information there
p287
aVthat it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,
p288
aVif you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.
p289
aVGiven a couple of clues, I could probably find out
p290
aVa lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut what it tells me is that, at a time when
p293
aVthere's more \u2014 there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been,
p294
aVit's harder to filter, we have greater tools.
p295
aVWe have free Internet tools that allow us,
p296
aVhelp us do this kind of investigation.
p297
aVWe have algorithms that are smarter than ever before,
p298
aVand computers that are quicker than ever before.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.
p301
aVThey're yes or no, they're black or white.
p302
aVTruth is never binary. Truth is a value.
p303
aVTruth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.
p304
aVNo matter how quick we get with computers, no matter
p305
aVhow much information we have, you'll never be able
p306
aVto remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,
p307
aVbecause in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.
p308
aVThanks very much. (Applause)
