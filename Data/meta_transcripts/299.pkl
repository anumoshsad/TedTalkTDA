VI don't speak English.
p4
aVI start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.
p5
aVI speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.
p6
aVI'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,
p7
aVand then went to university in Kisangani.
p8
aVAnd after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.
p9
aVBut what I've been doing \u2014
p10
aVwhen I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.
p11
aVAnd my father was a soldier,
p12
aVand my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.
p13
aVWhat I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,
p14
aVI was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat
p15
aVand whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,
p16
aVbring it in the main city to get access to the market.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut finally, I got myself involved.
p19
aVAround 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.
p20
aVAnd I wanted to do it, because \u2014 I believed \u2014 to continue my studies.
p21
aVI wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.
p22
aVSo, I did it.
p23
aVAnd for three to four years, I went to university.
p24
aVFor three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.
p25
aVI didn't succeed.
p26
aVI was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.
p27
aVAnd I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.
p28
aVMy family's poor, my area don't have better health care.
p29
aVI want to be a doctor to serve them."
p30
aVThree times, that means three years, and I start getting old.
p31
aVI say, "Oh, no, I continue."
p32
aVSo, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.
p33
aVWhen I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.
p34
aVIt's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing
p35
aVright up to now \u2014 I'm standing in front of you \u2014
p36
aVdoing botany and wildlife conservation.
p37
aa(lp38
VThat time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve
p39
aVwith some animals and also plants.
p40
aVAnd the training center there was built
p41
aVaround the scientific Congolese staff
p42
aVand some American scientists also.
p43
aVSo, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number \u2014
p44
aVI think that is the largest number of elephants
p45
aVwe have right now in protected areas in Congo.
p46
aVIt has also chimpanzees.
p47
aVAnd it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve
p48
aVbecause of this beautiful creature.
p49
aVThat is a forest giraffe.
p50
aVI think you guys know it quite well.
p51
aVHere we have savanna giraffes,
p52
aVbut through evolution we have this forest giraffe
p53
aVthat lives only in Congo.
p54
aVIt has also some beautiful primates.
p55
aVThirteen species \u2014 highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.
p56
aVAnd it has the Ituri Forest itself \u2014
p57
aVabout 1,300 species of plants, so far known.
p58
aa(lp59
VI joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,
p60
aVbut I started working with them as a student in 1991.
p61
aVI was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university
p62
aVbecause I accomplished with honor.
p63
aVBut I didn't like the way \u2014 the instruction I got was very poor.
p64
aVAnd I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.
p65
aVWith the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,
p66
aVthat most of you know, life became very, very difficult.
p67
aVAnd the work we have been doing
p68
aVwas completely difficult to do and to achieve it.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhen Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,
p71
aVso Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.
p72
aVSo they started fleeing from the east to the west.
p73
aVAnd the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,
p74
aVso there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,
p75
aVand coming like this.
p76
aVSo they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
p77
aVCongo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,
p78
aVand the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.
p79
aVSo soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
p80
aVOn their way, they looted everything.
p81
aVTorture, wars \u2014 oh, my God, you can't believe.
p82
aVEvery person was looking his way \u2014 where to go, we don't know.
p83
aVAnd it was for us, the young, the first time really
p84
aVwe hear the language of war, of guns.
p85
aVAnd even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,
p86
aVafter our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.
p87
aVThey were killing people. They were doing whatever they want
p88
aVbecause they have power.
p89
aVWho have been doing that?
p90
aVYoung children. Child soldiers.
p91
aVYou can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut I was from the west, working in the east.
p94
aVI even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.
p95
aVAnd when they came, they looted everything.
p96
aVYou can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,
p97
aVand everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.
p98
aVAnd I was from the same area to him.
p99
aVAll my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.
p100
aVBut I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.
p101
aVI stay. If I go, I will be killed.
p102
aVI can't go back to my area \u2014 it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].
p103
aa(lp104
VI stayed after they looted everything.
p105
aVWe have been doing research on botany,
p106
aVand we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.
p107
aVWe cut, we dry and we packed them,
p108
aVwe mounted them on a folder.
p109
aVPurpose: so that we start them for agriculture,
p110
aVfor medicine, for whatever, and for science,
p111
aVfor the study of the flora and the change of the forest.
p112
aVThat is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.
p113
aVAnd this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.
p114
aVI've been working with him about 10 years.
p115
aVAnd with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.
p116
aVBecause he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.
p117
aVHe has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.
p118
aVThey came to told me, I have to save him.
p119
aVAnd what I did, I gave him just antibiotics
p120
aVthat we care for tuberculosis.
p121
aVAnd fortunately, I saved his life.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd that was the language of the war.
p124
aVEverywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,
p125
aVkilling animals, the logging timbers and so on.
p126
aVAnd what of important things \u2014
p127
aVI think all of you here have a cell phone.
p128
aVThat mineral has killed a lot:
p129
aVfive millions of Congolese have gone because of this
p130
aVColombo-Tantalite \u2014 they call it Coltan \u2014
p131
aVthat they use it to make cell phones
p132
aVand it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,
p133
aVand good, big business of the war.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,
p136
aVI have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.
p137
aVI buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.
p138
aVAnd some of equipment went with them,
p139
aVon the top of the canopy, to save it.
p140
aVHe's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment
p141
aVon the canopy.
p142
aVAnd with the material that's left \u2014
p143
aVbecause they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,
p144
aVthey didn't understand it, they didn't go to school \u2014
p145
aVI packed it.
p146
aVAnd that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,
p147
aVto try to save that 4,000 material,
p148
aVwith people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.
p149
aVAnd after that, we succeeded.
p150
aVI housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
p151
aVAnd after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,
p152
aVso that we continue our studies.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe second war came while we didn't expect it.
p155
aVWith friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,
p156
aVand having some good music with WorldSpace radio,
p157
aVwhen it started, I think.
p158
aVSo, it was so bad.
p159
aVWe heard that now from the east again the war started,
p160
aVand it's going fast.
p161
aVThis time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.
p162
aVAnd the reserve was a target to the rebels.
p163
aVThree different movements and two militia acting in the same area
p164
aVand competing for natural resources.
p165
aVAnd there was no way to work.
p166
aVThey destroy everything.
p167
aVPoaching \u2014 oh, no way.
p168
aVAnd that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.
p169
aVWhat's the regulation of the reserve
p170
aVand what is the regulation of the parks?
p171
aVAnd they can't do what they are doing.
p172
aVSo we went to meet them.
p173
aVThat is Coltan extraction, gold mining.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, we started talking with them,
p176
aVconvincing them that we are in a protected area.
p177
aVThere are regulations
p178
aVthat it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.
p179
aVBut they said, "You guys,
p180
aVyou think that soldiers who are dying are not important,
p181
aVand your animals you are protecting are most important.
p182
aVWe don't think so.
p183
aVWe have to do it, because to let our movement advance."
p184
aVI say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."
p185
aVWe started talking with them and I was negotiating.
p186
aVTried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff
p187
aVand the villages of about 1,500 people.
p188
aVAnd we continued.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut I was doing that, negotiating with them.
p191
aVSometimes we are having meeting
p192
aVand they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,
p193
aVwith Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.
p194
aVSometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.
p195
aVI hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.
p196
aVSometimes, they are having a helicopter
p197
aVto supply them with ammunition and so on.
p198
aVThey used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,
p199
aVwhat comes from where, and where, and where.
p200
aVI had only this equipment \u2014 my satellite phone, my computer
p201
aVand a plastic solar panel \u2014 that I hide it in the forest.
p202
aVAnd every time, daily, after we have meeting,
p203
aVwhat compromise we have, whatever,
p204
aVI go, I write a short email, send it.
p205
aVI don't know how many people I had on my address.
p206
aVI sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war
p207
aVand what they are planning to do.
p208
aVThey started suspecting that what we do on the morning,
p209
aVand the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVSomething might be going on.
p212
aVAnd one day, we went for a meeting.
p213
aV(Applause)
p214
aVSorry.
p215
aa(lp216
VOne day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.
p217
aVHe had the same iridium cell phone like me.
p218
aVAnd he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?"
p219
aVI said, "I have never seen it.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVI don't know."
p222
aVAnd I had mine on my pocket.
p223
aVSo, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.
p224
aVThey didn't \u2014 they was not looking on me.
p225
aVSo I was scared.
p226
aVAnd when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.
p227
aVAnd I was sending news, doing whatever,
p228
aVreporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,
p229
aVwhat have been going.
p230
aVAnd for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.
p231
aVBecause there was no way \u2014
p232
aVwhatever they do, it's known the same time.
p233
aa(lp234
VDuring the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.
p235
aVWe have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.
p236
aVAnd during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,
p237
aVwe succeeded: we had the first Okapi.
p238
aVThis is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
p239
aVThis is not local population, this is rebels.
p240
aVThey are now happy sending the news
p241
aVthat they have protected the Okapi with the war,
p242
aVbecause we sent the news that they are killing
p243
aVand poaching everywhere.
p244
aVAfter a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,
p245
aVthey killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area
p246
aVwhere the zoo, where Okapi was born.
p247
aVAnd I was mad.
p248
aVI oppose it \u2014 that they are now going to dissect it,
p249
aVuntil I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.
p250
aVAnd I succeeded.
p251
aVThe elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.
p252
aa(lp253
VWhat we are doing after that \u2014 that was the situation of the war \u2014
p254
aVwe have to rebuild.
p255
aVI had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.
p256
aVI devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,
p257
aVbecause we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.
p258
aVWildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.
p259
aVI started this with 70 dollars,
p260
aVand start fundraising money to where I've been going.
p261
aVI had opportunity to go all over,
p262
aVwhere herbarium for my African material is.
p263
aVAnd they supported me a bit, and I built this.
p264
aVNow, it's doing work to train young Congolese.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd also, what one of the speciality we are doing,
p267
aVmy design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,
p268
aVand what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.
p269
aVThis is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,
p270
aVwhere we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,
p271
aVand we are tracking them.
p272
aVWe have now data of about 15 years,
p273
aVto see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.
p274
aVAnd that is \u2014 I think it's difficult for me.
p275
aVThis is a very embarrassing talk, I know.
p276
aVI don't know where to start, where to finish it.
p277
aa(lp278
VWhen I was thinking to come here,
p279
aVwhat best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.
p280
aVBut now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."
p281
aVWhere are you people?
p282
aVNow we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.
p283
aVBut is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?
p284
aVI think we see the war like a game \u2014
p285
aVlike soccer, football.
p286
aVEverybody is happy, but see what it's doing,
p287
aVsee what is going in Darfur.
p288
aVNow we say, oh, my God.
p289
aVSee what the wars in Rwanda.
p290
aVThat's because of the language of guns.
p291
aVI don't think that someone may blame Google,
p292
aVbecause it's doing the right things,
p293
aVeven if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google
p294
aVto connect between them.
p295
aVBut it's serving millions for the best.
p296
aVBut what is doing with gun industries?
p297
aVThank you.
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VChris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.
p301
aVJust wait over there.
p302
aVIt's an amazing story.
p303
aVI suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.
p304
aVHow can we help you?
p305
aa(lp306
VCorneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.
p307
aVI think that now I feel nervous.
p308
aVAnd I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.
p309
aVI did it myself.
p310
aVIf I know when I was young,
p311
aVthat [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,
p312
aVI would not have done it.
p313
aVMany, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,
p314
aVbut there are few who are going to school.
p315
aVMany are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,
p316
aVHIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.
p317
aVWhat you can assist us, it's by building capacities.
p318
aVHow many have got opportunity like me
p319
aVto go to U.S., do a master's?
p320
aVAnd go \u2014 now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.
p321
aVBut many of them are just here, because they don't have money.
p322
aVAnd they can't go even to university.
p323
aVThey can't even attain the bachelor's degree.
p324
aVBuilding capacities for the young generation
p325
aVis going to make a better generation
p326
aVand a better future tomorrow for Africa.
p327
aa(lp328
VCA: Thank you, thank you.
