VThank you so much. It's really scary to be here
p4
aVamong the smartest of the smart.
p5
aVI'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
p6
aVThere's a Jewish saying that I love.
p7
aVWhat is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
p8
aVI'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth
p9
aVabout our common humanity.
p10
aVAll stories interest me, and some haunt me
p11
aVuntil I end up writing them.
p12
aVCertain themes keep coming up:
p13
aVjustice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,
p14
aVfreedom.
p15
aVI'm aware of the mystery around us,
p16
aVso I write about coincidences, premonitions,
p17
aVemotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
p18
aa(lp19
VIn the last 20 years I have published a few books,
p20
aVbut I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,
p21
aVwhen I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
p22
aVThat made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,
p23
aVand my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVAllow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
p26
aVOne of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,
p27
aVof the opening ceremony,
p28
aVcalled me and said that I had been selected
p29
aVto be one of the flag-bearers.
p30
aVI replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity
p31
aVbecause I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
p32
aVActually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium
p33
aVwithout a walker.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVI was told that this was no laughing matter.
p36
aVThis would be the first time
p37
aVthat only women would carry the Olympic flag.
p38
aVFive women, representing five continents,
p39
aVand three Olympic gold medal winners.
p40
aVMy first question was, naturally,
p41
aVwhat was I going to wear?
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVA uniform, she said,
p44
aVand asked for my measurements.
p45
aVMy measurements.
p46
aVI had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,
p47
aVlooking like the Michelin Man.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBy the middle of February,
p51
aVI found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds
p52
aVcheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
p53
aVThose athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
p54
aVThey all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
p55
aVA speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,
p56
aVcan determine the result of a race or a game.
p57
aVHowever, what matters most \u2014 more than training or luck \u2014 is the heart.
p58
aVOnly a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
p59
aVIt is all about passion.
p60
aVThe streets of Turin were covered with red posters
p61
aVannouncing the slogan of the Olympics.
p62
aa(lp63
VPassion lives here. Isn't it always true?
p64
aVHeart is what drives us and determines our fate.
p65
aVThat is what I need for my characters in my books:
p66
aVa passionate heart.
p67
aVI need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,
p68
aVwho ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
p69
aVPeople like all of you in this room.
p70
aVNice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVThey only make good former spouses.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aV(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VIn the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:
p77
aVthree athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
p78
aVAlso, two women with passionate hearts:
p79
aVWangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya
p80
aVwho has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,
p81
aVshe has changed the soil, the weather,
p82
aVin some places in Africa, and of course
p83
aVthe economic conditions in many villages.
p84
aVAnd Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately
p85
aVagainst child prostitution.
p86
aVWhen she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
p87
aVShe told us of little girls raped by men who believe that
p88
aVhaving sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
p89
aVAnd of brothels where children are forced to receive five,
p90
aV15 clients per day,
p91
aVand if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
p92
aVIn the green room I received my uniform.
p93
aVIt was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,
p94
aVbut it was far from the Michelin Man suit
p95
aVthat I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
p96
aVI looked like a refrigerator.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVBut so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,
p99
aVthe universal symbol of beauty and passion.
p100
aVSophia is over 70 and she looks great.
p101
aVShe's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
p102
aVNow, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
p103
aVI don't know.
p104
aVWhen asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
p105
aVShe replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,
p106
aVand I don't make old people's noises."
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVSo, there you have some free advice
p109
aVfrom one of the most beautiful women on earth.
p110
aVNo grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,
p111
aVno talking to yourselves, no farting.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVWell, she didn't say that exactly.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAt some point around midnight,
p117
aVwe were summoned to the wings of the stadium,
p118
aVand the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started \u2014
p119
aVby the way, the same music that starts here,
p120
aVthe Aida March.
p121
aVSophia Loren was right in front of me \u2014 she's a foot taller than I am,
p122
aVnot counting the poofy hair.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVShe walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,
p125
aVholding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aV\u2014 on my tiptoes \u2014 holding the flag on my extended arm,
p128
aVso that my head was actually under the damn flag.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVAll the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.
p131
aVThat was fortunate for me, because in most press photos
p132
aVI appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVA place where most men would love to be.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aV(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VThe best four minutes of my entire life
p139
aVwere those in the Olympic stadium.
p140
aVMy husband is offended when I say this \u2014
p141
aValthough I have explained to him that what we do in private
p142
aVusually takes less than four minutes \u2014
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aV\u2014 so he shouldn't take it personally.
p145
aVI have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,
p146
aVbecause I don't want to forget them
p147
aVwhen old age destroys my brain cells.
p148
aa(lp149
VI want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics \u2014
p150
aVpassion.
p151
aVSo here's a tale of passion.
p152
aVThe year is 1998, the place is a prison camp
p153
aVfor Tutsi refugees in Congo.
p154
aVBy the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world
p155
aVare women and girls.
p156
aVWe can call this place in Congo a death camp,
p157
aVbecause those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
p158
aVThe protagonists of this story
p159
aVare a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
p160
aVShe's pregnant and a widow.
p161
aVSoldiers have forced her to watch
p162
aVas her husband was tortured and killed.
p163
aVSomehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,
p164
aVand a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
p165
aVTwo tiny little boys.
p166
aVShe cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,
p167
aVand ties it with her own hair.
p168
aVShe names the twins after the camp's commanders
p169
aVto gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea
p170
aVbecause her milk cannot sustain them.
p171
aVWhen the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,
p172
aVshe grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,
p173
aVeven when they hold a gun to her head.
p174
aVSomehow, the family survives for 16 months,
p175
aVand then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart
p176
aVof a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,
p177
aVwho manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,
p178
aVRose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,
p179
aVwhere they're now living and thriving.
p180
aa(lp181
VMapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
p182
aVThe protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women
p183
aVlike Rose Mapendo.
p184
aVI don't make them up. There's no need for that.
p185
aVI look around and I see them everywhere.
p186
aVI have worked with women and for women all my life.
p187
aVI know them well.
p188
aVI was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,
p189
aVin a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
p190
aVNo wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist \u2014
p191
aValthough the term had not reached Chile yet,
p192
aVso nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVI would soon find out that there was a high price to pay
p195
aVfor my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
p196
aVBut I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,
p197
aVI was able to deliver two.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVOnce, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,
p200
aVshe said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
p201
aVWe had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
p202
aVYes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,
p203
aVbut not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world
p204
aVwho are still forced into premature marriage,
p205
aVprostitution, forced labor \u2014
p206
aVthey have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
p207
aVThey have no control over their bodies or their lives.
p208
aVThey have no education and no freedom.
p209
aVThey are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
p210
aVFor most Western young women of today,
p211
aVbeing called a feminist is an insult.
p212
aVFeminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you
p213
aVthat it never stopped me from flirting,
p214
aVand I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVFeminism is not dead, by no means.
p217
aVIt has evolved. If you don't like the term,
p218
aVchange it, for Goddess' sake.
p219
aVCall it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;
p220
aVthe name doesn't matter,
p221
aVas long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
p224
aVThe place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
p225
aVThe year is 2005.
p226
aVJenny is a young American dental hygienist
p227
aVwho has gone to the clinic as a volunteer
p228
aVduring her three-week vacation.
p229
aVShe's prepared to clean teeth,
p230
aVbut when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,
p231
aVno dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
p232
aVOutside, there is a line of women
p233
aVwho have waited several hours to be treated.
p234
aVThe first patient is in excruciating pain
p235
aVbecause she has several rotten molars.
p236
aVJenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
p237
aVShe's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
p238
aVShe risks a lot and she's terrified.
p239
aVShe doesn't even have the proper instruments,
p240
aVbut fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
p241
aVJenny has a brave and passionate heart.
p242
aVShe murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
p243
aVAt the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
p244
aVThat day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
p245
aVThe next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,
p246
aVher first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
p247
aVThe woman's face looks like a watermelon.
p248
aVIt is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
p249
aVThe husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
p250
aVJenny is horrified at what she has done,
p251
aVbut then the translator explains
p252
aVthat the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
p253
aVThe day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home
p254
aVin time to prepare dinner for him.
p255
aa(lp256
VMillions of women live like this today.
p257
aVThey are the poorest of the poor.
p258
aVAlthough women do two-thirds of the world's labor,
p259
aVthey own less than one percent of the world's assets.
p260
aVThey are paid less than men for the same work
p261
aVif they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable
p262
aVbecause they have no economic independence,
p263
aVand they are constantly threatened by exploitation,
p264
aVviolence and abuse.
p265
aVIt is a fact that giving women education, work,
p266
aVthe ability to control their own income,
p267
aVinherit and own property, benefits the society.
p268
aVIf a woman is empowered,
p269
aVher children and her family will be better off.
p270
aVIf families prosper, the village prospers,
p271
aVand eventually so does the whole country.
p272
aa(lp273
VWangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
p274
aVShe talks with the women and explains that the land is barren
p275
aVbecause they have cut and sold the trees.
p276
aVShe gets the women to plant new trees and water them,
p277
aVdrop by drop.
p278
aVIn a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,
p279
aVthe soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
p280
aVThe poorest and most backward societies
p281
aVare always those that put women down.
p282
aVYet this obvious truth is ignored by governments
p283
aVand also by philanthropy.
p284
aVFor every dollar given to a women's program,
p285
aV20 dollars are given to men's programs.
p286
aVWomen are 51 percent of humankind.
p287
aVEmpowering them will change everything \u2014
p288
aVmore than technology and design and entertainment.
p289
aVI can promise you that women working together \u2014
p290
aVlinked, informed and educated \u2014
p291
aVcan bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
p292
aVIn any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,
p293
aVmainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
p294
aVMen run the world, and look at the mess we have.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhat kind of world do we want?
p297
aVThis is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
p298
aVDoes it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
p299
aVWe want a world where life is preserved
p300
aVand the quality of life is enriched for everybody,
p301
aVnot only for the privileged.
p302
aVIn January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings
p303
aVat the UC Berkeley library.
p304
aVNo museum or gallery in the United States,
p305
aVexcept for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,
p306
aVhas dared to show the paintings because the theme
p307
aVis the Abu Ghraib prison.
p308
aVThey are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,
p309
aVin the voluminous Botero style.
p310
aVI have not been able to get those images out of my mind
p311
aVor my heart.
p312
aVWhat I fear most is power with impunity.
p313
aVI fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
p314
aVIn our species, the alpha males define reality,
p315
aVand force the rest of the pack to accept that reality
p316
aVand follow the rules.
p317
aVThe rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,
p318
aVand in this case, the trickle-down effect,
p319
aVwhich does not work in economics, works perfectly.
p320
aVAbuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
p321
aVWomen and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
p322
aVEven the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse \u2014
p323
aVa woman or a child.
p324
aVI'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many
p325
aVthrough gender, income, race, and class.
p326
aa(lp327
VI think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
p328
aVin our civilization.
p329
aVBut for real change, we need feminine energy
p330
aVin the management of the world.
p331
aVWe need a critical number of women in positions of power,
p332
aVand we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
p333
aVI'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
p334
aVOld guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aVYes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs
p337
aVand legendary breasts.
p338
aVBut given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts
p339
aVof Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
p340
aVI want to make this world good.
p341
aVNot better, but to make it good.
p342
aVWhy not? It is possible. Look around in this room \u2014
p343
aVall this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
p344
aVLet's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves
p345
aVand get to work, passionately,
p346
aVin creating an almost perfect world.
p347
aVThank you.
