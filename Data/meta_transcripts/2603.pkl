VYou are a high-ranking military service member
p4
aVdeployed to Afghanistan.
p5
aVYou are responsible for the lives
p6
aVof hundreds of men and women,
p7
aVand your base is under attack.
p8
aVIncoming mortar rounds are exploding all around you.
p9
aVStruggling to see through the dust and the smoke,
p10
aVyou do your best to assist the wounded
p11
aVand then crawl to a nearby bunker.
p12
aa(lp13
VConscious but dazed by the blasts,
p14
aVyou lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened.
p15
aVAs you regain your vision,
p16
aVyou see a bloody face
p17
aVstaring back at you.
p18
aVThe image is terrifying,
p19
aVbut you quickly come to understand
p20
aVit's not real.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep.
p23
aVYou choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job
p24
aVor being seen as weak.
p25
aVYou give the vision a name,
p26
aVBloody Face in Bunker,
p27
aVand call it BFIB for short.
p28
aVYou keep BFIB locked away in your mind,
p29
aVsecretly haunting you,
p30
aVfor the next seven years.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow close your eyes.
p33
aVCan you see BFIB?
p34
aVIf you can, you're beginning to see the face
p35
aVof the invisible wounds of war,
p36
aVcommonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder
p37
aVand traumatic brain injury.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhile I can't say I have post-traumatic stress disorder,
p40
aVI've never been a stranger to it.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhen I was a little girl, I would visit my grandparents every summer.
p43
aVIt was my grandfather
p44
aVwho introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche.
p45
aVWhile my grandfather was serving as a Marine in the Korean War,
p46
aVa bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out.
p47
aVHe watched as a corpsman passed him over,
p48
aVdeclaring him a goner,
p49
aVand then leaving him to die.
p50
aa(lp51
VYears later, after his physical wounds had healed
p52
aVand he'd returned home,
p53
aVhe rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life.
p54
aVBut at night I would hear him shouting obscenities
p55
aVfrom his room down the hall.
p56
aVAnd during the day I would announce myself as I entered the room,
p57
aVcareful not to startle or agitate him.
p58
aVHe lived out the remainder of his days
p59
aVisolated and tight-lipped,
p60
aVnever finding a way to express himself,
p61
aVand I didn't yet have the tools to guide him.
p62
aa(lp63
VI wouldn't have a name for my grandfather's condition
p64
aVuntil I was in my 20s.
p65
aVSeeking a graduate degree in art therapy,
p66
aVI naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma.
p67
aVAnd while sitting in class learning about post-traumatic stress disorder,
p68
aVor PTSD for short,
p69
aVmy mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather
p70
aVbegan to take form.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe've had various names for post-traumatic stress
p73
aVthroughout the history of war:
p74
aVhomesickness,
p75
aVsoldier's heart,
p76
aVshell shock,
p77
aVthousand-yard stare, for instance.
p78
aVAnd while I was pursuing my degree, a new war was raging,
p79
aVand thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles,
p80
aVservice members were surviving blast injuries they wouldn't have before.
p81
aVBut the invisible wounds were reaching new levels,
p82
aVand this pushed military doctors and researchers
p83
aVto try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury, or TBI,
p84
aVand PTSD have on the brain.
p85
aa(lp86
VDue to advances in technology and neuroimaging,
p87
aVwe now know there's an actual shutdown in the Broca's,
p88
aVor the speech-language area of the brain, after an individual experiences trauma.
p89
aVThis physiological change,
p90
aVor speechless terror as it's often called,
p91
aVcoupled with mental health stigma,
p92
aVthe fear of being judged
p93
aVor misunderstood,
p94
aVpossibly even removed from their current duties,
p95
aVhas led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women.
p96
aVGeneration after generation of veterans
p97
aVhave chosen not to talk about their experiences,
p98
aVand suffer in solitude.
p99
aa(lp100
VI had my work cut out for me when I got my first job
p101
aVas an art therapist at the nation's largest military medical center,
p102
aVWalter Reed.
p103
aVAfter working for a few years on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,
p104
aVI eventually transferred to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,
p105
aVwhich leads TBI care for active duty service members.
p106
aVNow, I believed in art therapy,
p107
aVbut I was going to have to convince service members,
p108
aVbig, tough, strong, manly military men,
p109
aVand some women too,
p110
aVto give art-making as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe results have been nothing short of spectacular.
p113
aVVivid, symbolic artwork
p114
aVis being created by our servicemen and women,
p115
aVand every work of art tells a story.
p116
aVWe've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses
p117
aVthe speech-language issue with the brain.
p118
aVArt-making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma.
p119
aVService members can use the art-making to work through their experiences
p120
aVin a nonthreatening way.
p121
aVThey can then apply words to their physical creations,
p122
aVreintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, we've seen this can work with all forms of art \u2014
p125
aVdrawing, painting, collage \u2014
p126
aVbut what seems to have the most impact
p127
aVis mask-making.
p128
aVFinally, these invisible wounds don't just have a name,
p129
aVthey have a face.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd when service members create these masks,
p132
aVit allows them to come to grips, literally, with their trauma.
p133
aVAnd it's amazing how often that enables them
p134
aVto break through the trauma and start to heal.
p135
aa(lp136
VRemember BFIB?
p137
aVThat was a real experience for one of my patients,
p138
aVand when he created his mask,
p139
aVhe was able to let go of that haunting image.
p140
aVInitially, it was a daunting process for the service member,
p141
aVbut eventually he began to think of BFIB as the mask,
p142
aVnot his internal wound,
p143
aVand he would go to leave each session,
p144
aVhe would hand me the mask, and say, "Melissa, take care of him."
p145
aVEventually, we placed BFIB in a box to further contain him,
p146
aVand when the service member went to leave the NICoE,
p147
aVhe chose to leave BFIB behind.
p148
aVA year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,
p149
aVand both times BFIB was smiling
p150
aVand the service member didn't feel anxious.
p151
aVNow, whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory,
p152
aVhe continues to paint.
p153
aVEvery time he paints these disturbing images,
p154
aVhe sees them less or not at all.
p155
aa(lp156
VPhilosophers have told us for thousands of years
p157
aVthat the power to create
p158
aVis very closely linked to the power to destroy.
p159
aVNow science is showing us that the part of the brain
p160
aVthat registers a traumatic wound
p161
aVcan be the part of the brain where healing happens too.
p162
aVAnd art therapy is showing us how to make that connection.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe asked one of our service members
p165
aVto describe how mask-making impacted his treatment,
p166
aVand this is what he had to say.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Video) Service Member: You sort of just zone out into the mask.
p169
aVYou zone out into the drawing,
p170
aVand for me, it just released the block,
p171
aVso I was able to do it.
p172
aVAnd then when I looked at it after two days, I was like,
p173
aV"Holy crap, here's the picture, here's the key, here's the puzzle,"
p174
aVand then from there it just soared.
p175
aVI mean, from there my treatment just when out of sight,
p176
aVbecause they were like, Kurt, explain this, explain this.
p177
aVAnd for the first time in 23 years,
p178
aVI could actually talk about stuff openly to, like, anybody.
p179
aVI could talk to you about it right now if I wanted to,
p180
aVbecause it unlocked it.
p181
aVIt's just amazing.
p182
aVAnd it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD
p183
aVand TBI stuff together in one place
p184
aVthat has never happened before.
p185
aVSorry.
p186
aa(lp187
VMelissa Walker: Over the past five years,
p188
aVwe've had over 1,000 masks made.
p189
aVIt's pretty amazing, isn't it?
p190
aa(lp191
VThank you.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aVI wish I could have shared this process with my grandfather,
p195
aVbut I know that he would be thrilled
p196
aVthat we are finding ways
p197
aVto help today's and tomorrow's service members heal,
p198
aVand finding the resources within them
p199
aVthat they can call upon
p200
aVto heal themselves.
p201
aa(lp202
VThank you.
