VCode is the next universal language.
p4
aVIn the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.
p5
aVIn the eighties, it was probably money.
p6
aVBut for my generation of people,
p7
aVsoftware is the interface to our imagination and our world.
p8
aVAnd that means that we need
p9
aVa radically, radically more diverse set of people
p10
aVto build those products,
p11
aVto not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic,
p12
aVto see them as things that they can tinker
p13
aVand turn around and twist, and so forth.
p14
aa(lp15
VMy personal journey into the world of programming and technology
p16
aVstarted at the tender age of 14.
p17
aVI had this mad teenage crush on an older man,
p18
aVand the older man in question just happened to be
p19
aVthe then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.
p20
aVAnd I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.
p21
aVI wanted to somehow express all of this love,
p22
aVso I built him a website, it's over here.
p23
aVAnd in 2001, there was no Tumblr,
p24
aVthere was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.
p25
aVSo I needed to learn to code
p26
aVin order to express all of this longing and loving.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd that is how programming started for me.
p29
aVIt started as a means of self-expression.
p30
aVJust like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.
p31
aVAnd when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.
p32
aVBut then, there were other things to get excited about,
p33
aVlike poetry and knitting socks
p34
aVand conjugating French irregular verbs
p35
aVand coming up with make-believe worlds
p36
aVand Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.
p37
aVAnd I started to be one of those people
p38
aVwho felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.
p39
aa(lp40
VHere's what I think today.
p41
aVLittle girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
p42
aVLittle girls are amazing.
p43
aVThey are really, really good at concentrating on things
p44
aVand being exact and they ask amazing questions like,
p45
aV"What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"
p46
aVAnd they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
p47
aVIt's the parents who do.
p48
aVIt's us parents who feel
p49
aVlike computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline
p50
aVthat only belongs to the mystery makers.
p51
aVThat it's almost as far removed from everyday life
p52
aVas, say, nuclear physics.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd they are partly right about that.
p55
aVThere's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures
p56
aVand algorithms and practices,
p57
aVprotocols and paradigms in programming.
p58
aVAnd we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.
p59
aVWe've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other
p60
aVbetween the man and the machine
p61
aVto the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work
p62
aVor how to talk to them.
p63
aVAnd we do teach our kids how the human body works,
p64
aVwe teach them how the combustion engine functions
p65
aVand we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut
p66
aVyou can become one.
p67
aVBut when the kid comes to us and asks,
p68
aV"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"
p69
aVOr, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,'
p70
aVhow does it know which video to show?"
p71
aVOr, "Linda, is Internet a place?"
p72
aVWe adults, we grow oddly silent.
p73
aV"It's magic," some of us say.
p74
aV"It's too complicated," the others say.
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, it's neither.
p77
aVIt's not magic and it's not complicated.
p78
aVIt all just happened really, really, really fast.
p79
aVComputer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines,
p80
aVbut they made them very, very foreign to us,
p81
aVand also the language we speak to the computers
p82
aVso that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore
p83
aVwithout our fancy user interfaces.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd that's why no one recognized
p86
aVthat when I was conjugating French irregular verbs,
p87
aVI was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.
p88
aVAnd when I was excited about knitting,
p89
aVI actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands
p90
aVthat included loops inside of them.
p91
aVAnd that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest
p92
aVto find an exact language between English and mathematics
p93
aVfound its home inside of a computer.
p94
aVI was a programmer, but no one knew it.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.
p97
aVBut unless we give them tools to build with computers,
p98
aVwe are raising only consumers instead of creators.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis whole quest led me to this little girl.
p101
aVHer name is Ruby, she is six years old.
p102
aVShe is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.
p103
aVAnd every time I would run into a problem
p104
aVin trying to teach myself programming like,
p105
aV"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?",
p106
aVI would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it
p109
aVand the things Ruby taught me go like this.
p110
aVRuby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid
p111
aVof the bugs under your bed.
p112
aVAnd even the biggest of the problems
p113
aVare a group of tiny problems stuck together.
p114
aVAnd Ruby also introduced me to her friends,
p115
aVthe colorful side of the Internet culture.
p116
aVShe has friends like the Snow Leopard,
p117
aVwho is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.
p118
aVAnd she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.
p119
aVAnd she has friends like Linux the penguin
p120
aVwho's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.
p121
aVAnd idealistic foxes, and so on.
p122
aa(lp123
VIn Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.
p124
aVAnd, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff,
p125
aVso the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
p126
aVThis is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp
p127
aVclap, clap and jump."
p128
aVAnd you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.
p129
aVAnd you learn while loops by repeating that sequence
p130
aVwhile I'm standing on one leg.
p131
aVAnd you learn until loops by repeating that sequence
p132
aVuntil mom gets really mad.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVAnd most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhen coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world,
p137
aVI needed to really ask the kids how they see the world
p138
aVand what kind of questions they have
p139
aVand I would organize play testing sessions.
p140
aVI would start by showing the kids these four pictures.
p141
aVI would show them a picture of a car,
p142
aVa grocery store, a dog and a toilet.
p143
aVAnd I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"
p144
aVAnd the kids would be very conservative and go,
p145
aV"None of these is a computer.
p146
aVI know what a computer is:
p147
aVit's that glowing box
p148
aVin front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."
p149
aVBut then we would talk
p150
aVand we would discover that actually, a car is a computer,
p151
aVit has a navigation system inside of it.
p152
aVAnd a dog \u2014 a dog might not be a computer,
p153
aVbut it has a collar
p154
aVand the collar might have a computer inside of it.
p155
aVAnd grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers,
p156
aVlike the cashier system and the burglar alarms.
p157
aVAnd kids, you know what?
p158
aVIn Japan, toilets are computers
p159
aVand there's even hackers who hack them.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd we go further
p163
aVand I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them.
p164
aVAnd I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability
p165
aVto make anything in this room into a computer."
p166
aVAnd again, the kids go,
p167
aV"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this."
p168
aVBut I tell them, "Don't worry,
p169
aVyour parents don't know the right answer, either.
p170
aVThey've just started to hear about this thing
p171
aVcalled The Internet of Things.
p172
aVBut you kids, you are going to be the ones
p173
aVwho are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd then I had this little girl who came to me
p176
aVand took a bicycle lamp
p177
aVand she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer,
p178
aVit would change colors."
p179
aVAnd I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"
p180
aVAnd she thinks and she thinks,
p181
aVand she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer,
p182
aVwe could go on a biking trip with my father
p183
aVand we would sleep in a tent
p184
aVand this biking lamp could also be a movie projector."
p185
aVAnd that's the moment I'm looking for,
p186
aVthe moment when the kid realizes
p187
aVthat the world is definitely not ready yet,
p188
aVthat a really awesome way of making the world more ready
p189
aVis by building technology
p190
aVand that each one of us can be a part of that change.
p191
aa(lp192
VFinal story, we also built a computer.
p193
aVAnd we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM
p194
aVthat help it remember things.
p195
aVAnd after we've assembled our computer together,
p196
aVwe also design an application for it.
p197
aVAnd my favorite story is this little boy,
p198
aVhe's six years old
p199
aVand his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.
p200
aVAnd the boy, he has these huge headphones on
p201
aVand he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer
p202
aVbecause you see, he's built his own
p203
aVintergalactic planetary navigation application.
p204
aVAnd his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit,
p205
aVis on the other side of the room
p206
aVand the boy's important mission
p207
aVis to bring the father safely back to earth.
p208
aVAnd these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world
p209
aVand the way we build it with technology.
p210
aa(lp211
VFinally, the more approachable, the more inclusive,
p212
aVand the more diverse we make the world of technology,
p213
aVthe more colorful and better the world will look like.
p214
aVSo, imagine with me, for a moment,
p215
aVa world where the stories we tell
p216
aVabout how things get made don't only include
p217
aVthe twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys,
p218
aVbut also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians.
p219
aVImagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,
p220
aVwho live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s,
p221
aVthey grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology.
p222
aVThey embrace the powers and the opportunities
p223
aVand the limitations of the world.
p224
aVA world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical
p225
aVand a tiny bit weird.
p226
aa(lp227
VWhen I was a girl,
p228
aVI wanted to be a storyteller.
p229
aVI loved make-believe worlds
p230
aVand my favorite thing to do
p231
aVwas to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley.
p232
aVIn the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines.
p233
aVAnd in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia.
p234
aVAnd programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me.
p235
aVI still create worlds.
p236
aVInstead of stories, I do them with code.
p237
aa(lp238
VProgramming gives me this amazing power
p239
aVto build my whole little universe
p240
aVwith its own rules and paradigms and practices.
p241
aVCreate something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you.
