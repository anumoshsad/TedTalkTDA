(lp3
VSo a few weeks ago, a friend
p4
aVof mine gave this toy car to his
p5
aV8-year-old son.
p6
aVBut instead of going into a store and buying one,
p7
aVlike we do normally, he went to this
p8
aVwebsite and he downloaded
p9
aVa file, and then he printed it
p10
aVon this printer.
p11
aVSo this idea that you can
p12
aVmanufacture objects
p13
aVdigitally using these machines
p14
aVis something that The Economist magazine
p15
aVdefined as the Third Industrial Revolution.
p16
aa(lp17
VActually, I argue that there is another revolution
p18
aVgoing on, and it's the one that has to do with
p19
aVopen-source hardware and the maker's movement,
p20
aVbecause the printer that my friend used
p21
aVto print the toy is actually open-source.
p22
aVSo you go to the same website, you can download all the files
p23
aVthat you need in order to make that printer:
p24
aVthe construction files, the hardware, the software,
p25
aVall the instruction is there.
p26
aVAnd also this is part of a large
p27
aVcommunity where there are thousands of people
p28
aVaround the world that are actually
p29
aVmaking these kinds of printers,
p30
aVand there's a lot of innovation
p31
aVhappening because it's all open-source.
p32
aVYou don't need anybody's permission to create something great.
p33
aVAnd that space is like
p34
aVthe personal computer in 1976,
p35
aVlike the Apples with the other companies are fighting,
p36
aVand we will see in a few years,
p37
aVthere will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.
p38
aa(lp39
VWell, there's also another interesting thing.
p40
aVI said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart
p41
aVof this printer there is something I'm really attached to:
p42
aVthese Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of
p43
aVpowers this printer, is a project
p44
aVI've been working on for the past seven years.
p45
aVIt's an open-source project.
p46
aVI worked with these friends of mine that I have here.
p47
aVSo the five of us, two Americans, two Italians
p48
aVand a Spaniard, we \u2014 (Laughter)
p49
aVYou know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)
p50
aVSo we came together in this
p51
aVdesign institute called the Interaction Design Institute
p52
aVIvrea, which was teaching
p53
aVinteraction design, this idea that you can take
p54
aVdesign from the simple shape
p55
aVof an object and you can move it
p56
aVforward to design the way you interact with things.
p57
aVWell, when you design an object that's supposed to interact
p58
aVwith a human being, if you make a foam model
p59
aVof a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.
p60
aVYou have to have something that
p61
aVactually interacts with people.
p62
aVSo, we worked on Arduino and
p63
aVa lot of other projects there to
p64
aVcreate platforms that would be
p65
aVsimple for our students to use,
p66
aVso that our students could just build things that worked,
p67
aVbut they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo how do I make something that even a kid can use?
p70
aVAnd actually, with Arduino,
p71
aVwe have kids like Sylvia that you see here,
p72
aVthat actually make projects with Arduino.
p73
aVI have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me
p74
aVstuff they built for Arduino that's really
p75
aVscary to see the capabilities
p76
aVthat kids have when you give them the tools.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo let's look at what happens when you make a tool
p79
aVthat anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,
p80
aVso one of the examples that I like to sort of
p81
aVkick off this discussion is this
p82
aVexample of this cat feeder.
p83
aVThe gentleman who made this project had two cats.
p84
aVOne was sick and the other one
p85
aVwas healthy, so he had to make
p86
aVsure they ate the proper food.
p87
aVSo he made this thing that recognizes the cat
p88
aVfrom a chip mounted inside
p89
aVon the collar of the cat, and opens the door
p90
aVand the cat can eat the food.
p91
aVThis is made by recycling an old CD player
p92
aVthat you can get from an old computer,
p93
aVsome cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,
p94
aVand then suddenly you have a tool. You build something
p95
aVthat you cannot find on the market.
p96
aVAnd I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."
p97
aVIf you have an idea, you just go and you make it.
p98
aVThis is the equivalent of sketching on paper
p99
aVdone with electronics.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo one of the features that I
p102
aVthink is important about our work
p103
aVis that our hardware, on top of
p104
aVbeing made with love in Italy \u2014
p105
aVas you can see from the
p106
aVback of the circuit \u2014 (Laughter)
p107
aVis that it's open,
p108
aVso we publish all the design
p109
aVfiles for the circuit online,
p110
aVso you can download it and
p111
aVyou can actually use it to
p112
aVmake something, or to modify, to learn.
p113
aVYou know, when I was learning about programming,
p114
aVI learned by looking at other people's code,
p115
aVor looking at other people's circuits in magazines.
p116
aVAnd this is a good way to learn,
p117
aVby looking at other people's work.
p118
aVSo the different elements of the project are all open,
p119
aVso the hardware is released
p120
aVwith a Creative Commons license.
p121
aVSo, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes
p122
aVlike a piece of culture that you share
p123
aVand you build upon, like it was
p124
aVa song or a poem with Creative Commons.
p125
aVOr, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.
p126
aVThe documentation and the hands-on teaching
p127
aVmethodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.
p128
aVJust the name is protected so
p129
aVthat we can make sure that we can tell people
p130
aVwhat is Arduino and what isn't.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, Arduino itself is made of
p133
aVa lot of different open-source components
p134
aVthat maybe individually are hard to use for
p135
aVa 12-year-old kid, so Arduino
p136
aVwraps everything together into
p137
aVa mashup of open-source technologies
p138
aVwhere we try to give them the
p139
aVbest user experience to get something done quickly.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo you have situations like this,
p142
aVwhere some people in Chile
p143
aVdecided to make their own boards instead of buying them,
p144
aVto organize a workshop and
p145
aVto save money. Or there are
p146
aVcompanies that make their own
p147
aVvariations of Arduino that fit
p148
aVin a certain market, and there's
p149
aVprobably, maybe like a 150 of them
p150
aVor something at the moment.
p151
aVThis one is made by a company
p152
aVcalled Adafruit, which is run by
p153
aVthis woman called Limor Fried,
p154
aValso known as Ladyada, who is
p155
aVone of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement
p156
aVand the maker movement.
p157
aVSo, this idea that you have a new, sort of
p158
aVturbo-charged DIY community
p159
aVthat believes in open-source,
p160
aVin collaboration, collaborates
p161
aVonline, collaborates in different spaces.
p162
aVThere is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered
p163
aVall these people and sort of put them together
p164
aVas a community, and you see
p165
aVa very technical project explained in a
p166
aVvery simple language, beautifully typeset.
p167
aVOr you have websites,
p168
aVlike this one, like Instructables,
p169
aVwhere people actually teach each other about anything.
p170
aVSo this one is about Arduino projects,
p171
aVthe page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can
p172
aVlearn how to make a cake and everything else.
p173
aVSo let's look at some projects.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo this one is a quadcopter.
p176
aVIt's a small model helicopter.
p177
aVIn a way, it's a toy, no?
p178
aVAnd so this one was military technology
p179
aVa few years ago, and now it's
p180
aVopen-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.
p181
aVDIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.
p182
aVBut then somebody actually launched this start-up called
p183
aVMatternet, where they figured out that you could
p184
aVuse this to actually transport
p185
aVthings from one village to another in Africa,
p186
aVand the fact that this was easy to find,
p187
aVopen-source, easy to hack, enabled them
p188
aVto prototype their company really quickly.
p189
aVOr, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick
p190
aVof hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over
p191
aVagain, so I decided to do something about it.
p192
aVThis Arduino project,
p193
aVwhich I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime
p194
aVany of these over-exposed
p195
aVpersonalities is mentioned. (Laughter)
p196
aVI'll show you how I made it. (Applause)
p197
aVMB: Check this out.
p198
aVMR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier
p199
aVtoday to find out what she was planning on wearing to her \u2014
p200
aVMB: Eh? (Laughter)
p201
aVMR: It should do a pretty good
p202
aVjob of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details
p203
aVof Kim Kardashian's wedding.
p204
aVMB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here
p205
aVis that Matt found this module
p206
aVthat lets Arduino process
p207
aVTV signals, he found some code
p208
aVwritten by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,
p209
aVput it together and then created this great project.
p210
aa(lp211
VIt's also used, Arduino's used,
p212
aVin serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.
p213
aVThere's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of
p214
aVmeasuring some parameters.
p215
aVOr it's used for \u2014
p216
aV(Music)
p217
aVSo this is a musical interface
p218
aVbuilt by a student from Italy,
p219
aVand he's now turning this into
p220
aVa product. Because it was a
p221
aVstudent project becoming a product.
p222
aVOr it can be used to make an assistive device.
p223
aVThis is a glove that understands
p224
aVthe sign language and transforms
p225
aVthe gestures you make into sounds
p226
aVand writes the words that you're signing on a display
p227
aVAnd again, this is made of all different parts you can find
p228
aVon all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,
p229
aVand you assemble it into a project.
p230
aVOr this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,
p231
aVwhere they met with this boy
p232
aVwho has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,
p233
aVso they built this device that
p234
aVallows the kid to play baseball
p235
aValthough he has limited
p236
aVmovement capability.
p237
aa(lp238
VOr you can find it in arts projects.
p239
aVSo this is the txtBomber.
p240
aVSo you put a message into this device
p241
aVand then you roll it on the wall, and it basically
p242
aVhas all these solenoids
p243
aVpressing the buttons on spray cans,
p244
aVso you just pull it over a wall
p245
aVand it just writes on the wall
p246
aVall the political messages.
p247
aVSo, yeah. (Applause)
p248
aVThen we have this plant here.
p249
aVThis is called Botanicalls,
p250
aVbecause there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module
p251
aVin the plant, and it's measuring
p252
aVthe well-being of the plant,
p253
aVand it's creating a Twitter account
p254
aVwhere you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)
p255
aVSo, you know, this plant
p256
aVwill start to say, "This is really hot," or
p257
aVthere's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter)
p258
aVSo it just gives a personality to your plant.
p259
aVOr this is something that twitters when the
p260
aVbaby inside the belly of a
p261
aVpregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)
p262
aVOr this is a 14-year-old kid in
p263
aVChile who made a system that
p264
aVdetects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.
p265
aVHe has 280,000 followers.
p266
aVHe's 14 and he anticipated
p267
aVa governmental project by one year. (Applause)
p268
aVOr again, another project where,
p269
aVby analyzing the Twitter feed
p270
aVof a family, you can basically
p271
aVpoint where they are, like in the "Harry Potter" movie.
p272
aVSo you can find out everything about this project on the website.
p273
aVOr somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)
p274
aVIt's interesting how, in 2009,
p275
aVGizmodo basically defined,
p276
aVsaid that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,
p277
aVso it was \u2014 a lot changed in between. (Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo very serious project.
p280
aVWhen the Fukushima disaster happened,
p281
aVa bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information
p282
aVthat the government was giving wasn't really open
p283
aVand really reliable, so they built
p284
aVthis Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network
p285
aVinterface. They made 100
p286
aVof them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially
p287
aVthe data that they gathered gets published on this website
p288
aVcalled Cosm, another website
p289
aVthey built, so you can actually get reliable real-time
p290
aVinformation from the field,
p291
aVand you can get unbiased information.
p292
aVOr this machine here, it's from
p293
aVthe DIY bio movement,
p294
aVand it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,
p295
aVand again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.
p296
aVOr you have students in developing countries making
p297
aVreplicas of scientific instruments that cost
p298
aVa lot of money to make.
p299
aVActually they just build them themselves for a lot less
p300
aVusing Arduino and a few parts.
p301
aVThis is a pH probe.
p302
aVOr you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.
p303
aVThey learned how to program and to make robots when they
p304
aVwere probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino
p305
aVto make these robots that play football. They became
p306
aVworld champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
p307
aVAnd so when we had to make
p308
aVour own educational robot, we just went to them and said,
p309
aVyou know, "You design it, because you know exactly
p310
aVwhat is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."
p311
aVNot me. I'm an old guy.
p312
aVWhat am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)
p313
aVBut as I \u2014 in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VThere's also companies like Google
p316
aVthat are using the technology
p317
aVto create interfaces between
p318
aVmobile phones, tablets and the real world.
p319
aVSo the Accessory Development Kit
p320
aVfrom Google is open-source
p321
aVand based on Arduino, as opposed
p322
aVto the one from Apple which is
p323
aVclosed-source, NDA, sign your
p324
aVlife to Apple. Here you are.
p325
aVThere's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the
p326
aVmaze is moving when you tilt the tablet.
p327
aa(lp328
VAlso, I come from Italy, and the design is important
p329
aVin Italy, and yet very conservative.
p330
aVSo we worked with a design
p331
aVstudio called Habits, in Milan,
p332
aVto make this mirror, which is completely open-source.
p333
aVThis doubles also as an iPod speaker.
p334
aVSo the idea is that the hardware, the software,
p335
aVthe design of the object, the fabrication,
p336
aVeverything about this project is open-source
p337
aVand you can make it yourself.
p338
aVSo we want other designers to pick this up and learn how
p339
aVto make great devices, to learn
p340
aVhow to make interactive products
p341
aVby starting from something real.
p342
aa(lp343
VBut when you have this idea,
p344
aVyou know, what happens to all these ideas?
p345
aVThere's, like, thousands of ideas that I \u2014
p346
aVYou know, it would take seven hours for me to do
p347
aVall the presentations.
p348
aVI will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.
p349
aVBut let's start from this example:
p350
aVSo, the group of people
p351
aVthat started this company called Pebble, they prototyped
p352
aVa watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,
p353
aVand you can display information
p354
aVon it. And they prototyped with
p355
aVan old LCD screen from a Nokia
p356
aVmobile phone and an Arduino.
p357
aVAnd then, when they had a final
p358
aVproject, they actually went to Kickstarter
p359
aVand they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make
p360
aVa few of them to sell.
p361
aVThey got 10 million dollars.
p362
aVThey got a completely
p363
aVfully funded start-up, and they don't have to,
p364
aVyou know, get VCs involved or anything,
p365
aVjust excite the people with their great project.
p366
aa(lp367
VThe last project I want to show you is this:
p368
aVIt's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,
p369
aVso if you want to contribute, please do it.
p370
aVIt's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably
p371
aVthe least open-source thing you can imagine,
p372
aVand it contains an Arduino
p373
aVconnected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,
p374
aVyou can actually upload your experiments
p375
aVinto this satellite and run them.
p376
aVSo imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite
p377
aVfor a week and do satellite
p378
aVspace experiments like that.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo, as I said, there's
p381
aVlots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just
p382
aVwant to thank the Arduino community
p383
aVfor being the best, and just
p384
aVevery day making lots of projects.
p385
aVThank you. (Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd thanks to the community.
p390
aa(lp391
VChris Anderson: Massimo,
p392
aVyou told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,
p393
aVthat it would take off like this.
p394
aa(lp395
VMB: No.
p396
aa(lp397
VCA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you
p398
aVsee what you've unlocked?
p399
aa(lp400
VMB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community
p401
aVare enabling people to make
p402
aVgreat stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.
p403
aVIt's just, it's difficult to describe this.
p404
aVEvery morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that
p405
aVGoogle Alerts sends me, and it's
p406
aVjust amazing. It's just
p407
aVgoing into every field that you can imagine.
p408
aa(lp409
VCA: Thank you so much. (Applause)
