VIf you really want to understand
p4
aVthe problem that we're facing with the oceans,
p5
aVyou have to think about the biology
p6
aVat the same time you think about the physics.
p7
aVWe can't solve the problems
p8
aVunless we start studying the ocean
p9
aVin a very much more interdisciplinary way.
p10
aVSo I'm going to demonstrate that through
p11
aVdiscussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.
p12
aVWe'll look at sea level rise.
p13
aVWe'll look at ocean warming.
p14
aVAnd then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification \u2014
p15
aVif you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?
p16
aVWhat frightens you?"
p17
aVfor me, it's ocean acidification.
p18
aVAnd this has come onto the stage pretty recently.
p19
aVSo I will spend a little time at the end.
p20
aa(lp21
VI was in Copenhagen in December
p22
aVlike a number of you in this room.
p23
aVAnd I think we all found it, simultaneously,
p24
aVan eye-opening
p25
aVand a very frustrating experience.
p26
aVI sat in this large negotiation hall,
p27
aVat one point, for three or four hours,
p28
aVwithout hearing the word "oceans" one time.
p29
aVIt really wasn't on the radar screen.
p30
aVThe nations that brought it up
p31
aVwhen we had the speeches of the national leaders \u2014
p32
aVit tended to be the leaders of the small island states,
p33
aVthe low-lying island states.
p34
aVAnd by this weird quirk
p35
aVof alphabetical order of the nations,
p36
aVa lot of the low-lying states,
p37
aVlike Kiribati and Nauru,
p38
aVthey were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.
p39
aVYou know, they were marginalized
p40
aVin the negotiation room.
p41
aa(lp42
VOne of the problems
p43
aVis coming up with the right target.
p44
aVIt's not clear what the target should be.
p45
aVAnd how can you figure out how to fix something
p46
aVif you don't have a clear target?
p47
aVNow, you've heard about "two degrees":
p48
aVthat we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.
p49
aVBut there's not a lot of science behind that number.
p50
aVWe've also talked about
p51
aVconcentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
p52
aVShould it be 450? Should it be 400?
p53
aVThere's not a lot of science behind that one either.
p54
aVMost of the science that is behind these numbers,
p55
aVthese potential targets,
p56
aVis based on studies on land.
p57
aVAnd I would say, for the people that work in the ocean
p58
aVand think about what the targets should be,
p59
aVwe would argue that they must be much lower.
p60
aVYou know, from an oceanic perspective,
p61
aV450 is way too high.
p62
aVNow there's compelling evidence
p63
aVthat it really needs to be 350.
p64
aVWe are, right now, at 390 parts per million
p65
aVof CO2 in the atmosphere.
p66
aVWe're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,
p67
aVso we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,
p68
aVand the discussion as we go forward
p69
aVhas to focus on how far the overshoot goes
p70
aVand what's the pathway back to 350.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, why is this so complicated?
p73
aVWhy don't we know some of these things a little bit better?
p74
aVWell, the problem is that
p75
aVwe've got very complicated forces in the climate system.
p76
aVThere's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.
p77
aVThere's air-sea interactions.
p78
aVHere in Galapagos,
p79
aVwe're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.
p80
aVBut the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.
p81
aVVolcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.
p82
aVThat changes our climate.
p83
aVThe ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.
p84
aVSo anything that influences
p85
aVhow ocean surface waters mix with the deep water
p86
aVchanges the ocean of the planet.
p87
aVAnd we know the solar output's not constant through time.
p88
aVSo those are all natural causes of climate change.
p89
aVAnd then we have the human-induced causes
p90
aVof climate change as well.
p91
aVWe're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,
p92
aVthe reflectivity.
p93
aVWe inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,
p94
aVand we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide \u2014
p95
aVit's methane, ozone,
p96
aVoxides of sulfur and nitrogen.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.
p99
aVIs CO2 produced by man's activities
p100
aVcausing the planet to warm up?
p101
aVBut to answer that question,
p102
aVto make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,
p103
aVyou have to know something about
p104
aVall of these other agents of change.
p105
aVBut the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.
p106
aVYou know, thousands of scientists
p107
aVhave been working on understanding
p108
aVall of these man-made causes
p109
aVand the natural causes.
p110
aVAnd we've got it worked out, and we can say,
p111
aV"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."
p112
aVNow, we have many ways to study natural variability.
p113
aVI'll show you a few examples of this now.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.
p116
aVIt's a scientific drilling vessel.
p117
aVWe go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed
p118
aVto recover sediments
p119
aVthat tell us stories of climate change, right.
p120
aVLike one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future
p121
aVis to drill down in time
p122
aVto the last period
p123
aVwhere we had CO2 double what it is today.
p124
aVAnd so that's what we've done with this ship.
p125
aVThis was \u2014 this is south of the Antarctic Circle.
p126
aVIt looks downright tropical there.
p127
aVOne day where we had calm seas and sun,
p128
aVwhich was the reason I could get off the ship.
p129
aVMost of the time it looked like this.
p130
aVWe had a waves up to 50 ft.
p131
aVand winds averaging
p132
aVabout 40 knots for most of the voyage
p133
aVand up to 70 or 80 knots.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo that trip just ended,
p136
aVand I can't show you too many results from that right now,
p137
aVbut we'll go back one more year,
p138
aVto another drilling expedition I've been involved in.
p139
aVThis was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.
p140
aVIt's the ANDRILL project.
p141
aVAnd we made the very first bore hole
p142
aVthrough the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.
p143
aVThis is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket
p144
aVto keep everybody warm,
p145
aVdrilling at temperatures of minus 40.
p146
aVAnd we drilled in the Ross Sea.
p147
aVThat's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.
p148
aVSo, this huge floating ice shelf
p149
aVthe size of Alaska
p150
aVcomes from West Antarctica.
p151
aVNow, West Antarctica is the part of the continent
p152
aVwhere the ice is grounded on sea floor
p153
aVas much as 2,000 meters deep.
p154
aVSo that ice sheet is partly floating,
p155
aVand it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.
p158
aVBecause it's partly floating, you can imagine,
p159
aVis sea level rises a little bit,
p160
aVthe ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.
p161
aVWhen that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.
p162
aVSo we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,
p163
aVand exactly how fast that ice can melt.
p164
aVHere's the cartoon on the left there.
p165
aVWe drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf
p166
aVthen through 900 meters of water
p167
aVand then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.
p168
aVSo it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.
p169
aa(lp170
VIt took about 10 years to put this project together.
p171
aVAnd here's what we found.
p172
aVNow, there's 40 scientists working on this project,
p173
aVand people are doing all kinds of really complicated
p174
aVand expensive analyses.
p175
aVBut it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story
p176
aVwas this simple visual description.
p177
aVYou know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.
p178
aVWe saw these alternations
p179
aVbetween sediments that look like this \u2014
p180
aVthere's gravel and cobbles in there
p181
aVand a bunch of sand.
p182
aVThat's the kind of material in the deep sea.
p183
aVIt can only get there if it's carried out by ice.
p184
aVSo we know there's an ice shelf overhead.
p185
aVAnd that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.
p186
aVThis is absolutely beautiful stuff.
p187
aVThis sediment is 100 percent made up
p188
aVof the shells of microscopic plants.
p189
aVAnd these plants need sunlight,
p190
aVso we know when we find that sediment
p191
aVthere's no ice overhead.
p192
aVAnd we saw about 35 alternations
p193
aVbetween open water and ice-covered water,
p194
aVbetween gravels and these plant sediments.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo what that means is, what it tells us
p197
aVis that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,
p198
aVmelted back and formed anew
p199
aVabout 35 times.
p200
aVAnd this is in the past four million years.
p201
aVThis was completely unexpected.
p202
aVNobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
p203
aVwas this dynamic.
p204
aVIn fact, the lore for many years has been,
p205
aV"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,
p206
aVand it's been there ever since."
p207
aVAnd now we know that in our recent past
p208
aVit melted back and formed again,
p209
aVand sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.
p210
aa(lp211
VWhat caused it?
p212
aVWell, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes
p213
aVin the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,
p214
aVjust caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.
p215
aVBut here's the key thing:
p216
aVyou know, the other thing we found out
p217
aVis that the ice sheet passed a threshold,
p218
aVthat the planet warmed up enough \u2014
p219
aVand the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade \u2014
p220
aVthe planet warmed up enough that it became ...
p221
aVthat ice sheet became very dynamic
p222
aVand was very easily melted.
p223
aVAnd you know what?
p224
aVWe've actually changed the temperature in the last century
p225
aVjust the right amount.
p226
aVSo many of us are convinced now
p227
aVthat West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.
p228
aVWe do expect to see a sea-level rise
p229
aVon the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.
p230
aVAnd it could be larger than that.
p231
aVThis is a serious consequence
p232
aVfor nations like Kiribati,
p233
aVyou know, where the average elevation
p234
aVis about a little over a meter above sea level.
p235
aa(lp236
VOkay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.
p237
aVThis is a bleached coral,
p238
aVcoral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.
p239
aVThis is from Champion Island.
p240
aVIt's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.
p241
aVAnd it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
p242
aVWhen these things die,
p243
aVimmediately, organisms come in
p244
aVand encrust and live on that dead surface.
p245
aVAnd so, when a coral colony is killed
p246
aVby an El Nino event,
p247
aVit leaves this indelible record.
p248
aVYou can go then and study corals
p249
aVand figure out how often do you see this.
p250
aVSo one of the things thought of in the '80s
p251
aVwas to go back and take cores
p252
aVof coral heads throughout the Galapagos
p253
aVand find out how often was there a devastating event.
p254
aVAnd just so you know, 1982-'83,
p255
aVthat El Nino killed 95 percent
p256
aVof all the corals here in Galapagos.
p257
aVThen there was similar mortality in '97-'98.
p258
aVAnd what we found
p259
aVafter drilling back in time two to 400 years
p260
aVwas that these were unique events.
p261
aVWe saw no other mass mortality events.
p262
aVSo these events in our recent past really are unique.
p263
aVSo they're either just truly monster El Ninos,
p264
aVor they're just very strong El Ninos
p265
aVthat occurred against a backdrop of global warming.
p266
aVEither case, it's bad news
p267
aVfor the corals of the Galapagos Islands.
p268
aa(lp269
VHere's how we sample the corals.
p270
aVThis is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.
p271
aVThis coral is eight meters tall, right.
p272
aVAnd it been growing for about 600 years.
p273
aVNow, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.
p274
aVAnd she was diving here with John Lauret \u2014 I think it was 1994 \u2014
p275
aVand collected a little nugget and sent it to me.
p276
aVAnd we started working on it,
p277
aVand we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean
p278
aVfrom analyzing a coral like this.
p279
aVSo we have a diamond drill.
p280
aVWe're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.
p281
aVThe core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.
p282
aVAnd that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.
p283
aVYou can see some of the coral cores there on the right.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.
p286
aVWe're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.
p287
aVI'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.
p288
aVAnd we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.
p289
aVThat the place where,
p290
aVduring an earthquake in 1954,
p291
aVthis marine terrace was lifted up
p292
aVout of the ocean very quickly,
p293
aVand it was lifted up about six to seven meters.
p294
aVAnd so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.
p295
aVIf you go on the ground there, it looks like this,
p296
aVand this is the grandaddy coral.
p297
aVIt's 11 meters in diameter,
p298
aVand we know that it started growing
p299
aVin the year 1584.
p300
aVImagine that.
p301
aVAnd that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,
p302
aVuntil 1954, when the earthquake happened.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow the reason we know it's 1584
p305
aVis that these corals have growth bands.
p306
aVWhen you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,
p307
aVyou see these light and dark bands.
p308
aVEach one of those is a year.
p309
aVWe know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.
p310
aVAnd we just count on down to the bottom.
p311
aVThen their other attribute is
p312
aVthat they have this great chemistry.
p313
aVWe can analyze the carbonate
p314
aVthat makes up the coral,
p315
aVand there's a whole bunch of things we can do.
p316
aVBut in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.
p317
aVTheir ratio tells us the water temperature.
p318
aVIn this example here,
p319
aVwe had monitored this reef in Galapagos
p320
aVwith temperature recorders,
p321
aVso we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.
p322
aVThen after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,
p323
aVand now you can see, those curves match perfectly.
p324
aa(lp325
VIn this case, at these islands,
p326
aVyou know, corals
p327
aVare instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.
p328
aVAnd of course, our thermometers
p329
aVonly take us back 50 years or so here.
p330
aVThe coral can take us back
p331
aVhundreds and thousands of years.
p332
aVSo, what we do:
p333
aVwe've merged a lot of different data sets.
p334
aVIt's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.
p335
aVBut we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records
p336
aVof temperature change that go back hundreds of years,
p337
aVand we put them together.
p338
aVHere's a synthetic diagram.
p339
aVThere's a whole family of curves here.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years
p342
aVof temperature on the planet.
p343
aVAnd there's five or six different compilations there,
p344
aVBut each one of those compilations reflects input
p345
aVfrom hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.
p346
aVWe do similar things with ice cores.
p347
aVWe work with tree rings.
p348
aVAnd that's how we discover
p349
aVwhat is truly natural
p350
aVand how different is the last century, right?
p351
aVAnd I chose this one
p352
aVbecause it's complicated and messy looking, right.
p353
aVThis is as messy as it gets.
p354
aVYou can see there's some signals there.
p355
aVSome of the records
p356
aVshow lower temperatures than others.
p357
aVSome of them show greater variability.
p358
aVBut they all tell us
p359
aVwhat the natural variability is.
p360
aVSome of them are from the northern hemisphere;
p361
aVsome are from the entire globe.
p362
aa(lp363
VBut here's what we can say:
p364
aVwhat's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.
p365
aVIt was cooling down
p366
aVuntil about 1900 or so.
p367
aVAnd there is natural variability
p368
aVcaused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.
p369
aVA century-scale, decadal-scale variability,
p370
aVand we know the magnitude;
p371
aVit's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.
p372
aVBut then at the very end is where
p373
aVwe have the instrumental record in black.
p374
aVAnd there's the temperature up there in 2009.
p375
aVYou know, we've warmed the globe
p376
aVabout a degree Centigrade in the last century,
p377
aVand there's nothing
p378
aVin the natural part of that record
p379
aVthat resembles what we've seen in the last century.
p380
aVYou know, that's the strength of our argument,
p381
aVthat we are doing something that's truly different.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo I'll close with a short discussion
p384
aVof ocean acidification.
p385
aVI like it as a component of global change to talk about,
p386
aVbecause, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,
p387
aVand I talk to that community fairly often,
p388
aVyou cannot deny
p389
aVthe simple physics
p390
aVof CO2 dissolving in the ocean.
p391
aVYou know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,
p392
aVfrom fossil fuels, from cement production.
p393
aVRight now, about a third of that carbon dioxide
p394
aVis dissolving straight into the sea, right?
p395
aVAnd as it does so,
p396
aVit makes the ocean more acidic.
p397
aVSo, you cannot argue with that.
p398
aVThat is what's happening right now,
p399
aVand it's a very different issue
p400
aVthan the global warming issue.
p401
aVIt has many consequences.
p402
aa(lp403
VThere's consequences for carbonate organisms.
p404
aVThere are many organisms
p405
aVthat build their shells out of calcium carbonate \u2014
p406
aVplants and animals both.
p407
aVThe main framework material of coral reefs
p408
aVis calcium carbonate.
p409
aVThat material is more soluble
p410
aVin acidic fluid.
p411
aVSo one of the things we're seeing
p412
aVis organisms are having
p413
aVto spend more metabolic energy
p414
aVto build and maintain their shells.
p415
aVAt some point, as this transience,
p416
aVas this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,
p417
aVthat material's actually going to start to dissolve.
p418
aVAnd on coral reefs,
p419
aVwhere some of the main framework organisms disappear,
p420
aVwe will see a major loss
p421
aVof marine biodiversity.
p422
aVBut it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.
p423
aVThere's many physiological processes
p424
aVthat are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.
p425
aVSo many reactions involving enzymes and proteins
p426
aVare sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.
p427
aVSo, all of these things \u2014
p428
aVgreater metabolic demands,
p429
aVreduced reproductive success,
p430
aVchanges in respiration and metabolism.
p431
aVYou know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons
p432
aVto expect to see stressed
p433
aVcaused by this transience.
p434
aa(lp435
VSo we figured out some pretty interesting ways
p436
aVto track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,
p437
aVgoing back millions of years.
p438
aVWe used to do it just with ice cores,
p439
aVbut in this case, we're going back 20 million years.
p440
aVAnd we take samples of the sediment,
p441
aVand it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,
p442
aVand therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.
p443
aVAnd here's the thing:
p444
aVyou have to go back about 15 million years
p445
aVto find a time when CO2 levels
p446
aVwere about what they are today.

aVYou have to go back about 30 million years
p448
aVto find a time when CO2 levels
p449
aVwere double what they are today.
p450
aVNow, what that means is
p451
aVthat all of the organisms that live in the sea
p452
aVhave evolved in this chemostatted ocean,
p453
aVwith CO2 levels lower than they are today.
p454
aVThat's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt
p455
aVto this rapid acidification
p456
aVthat's going on right now.

VSo, Charlie Veron
p459
aVcame up with this statement last year:
p460
aV"The prospect of ocean acidification
p461
aVmay well be the most serious
p462
aVof all of the predicted outcomes
p463
aVof anthropogenic CO2 release."
p464
aVAnd I think that may very well be true,
p465
aVso I'll close with this.
p466
aVYou know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,
p467
aVbut for the sake of the oceans,
p468
aVwe have to cap or limit CO2 emissions
p469
aVas soon as possible.
