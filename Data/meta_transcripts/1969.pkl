VWhat is the intersection between technology, art and science?
p4
aVCuriosity and wonder,
p5
aVbecause it drives us to explore,
p6
aVbecause we're surrounded by things we can't see.
p7
aVAnd I love to use film to take us on a journey
p8
aVthrough portals of time and space,
p9
aVto make the invisible visible,
p10
aVbecause what that does,
p11
aVit expands our horizons,
p12
aVit transforms our perception,
p13
aVit opens our minds
p14
aVand it touches our heart.
p15
aVSo here are some scenes from my 3D IMAX film,
p16
aV"Mysteries of the Unseen World."

aa(lp20
VThere is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect,
p21
aVand time lapse makes us discover
p22
aVand broaden our perspective of life.
p23
aVWe can see how organisms emerge and grow,
p24
aVhow a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor
p25
aVto look at the sunlight.
p26
aVAnd at the grand scale,
p27
aVtime lapse allows us to see our planet in motion.
p28
aVWe can view not only the vast sweep of nature,
p29
aVbut the restless movement of humanity.
p30
aVEach streaking dot represents a passenger plane,
p31
aVand by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery,
p32
aVwe can see something that's above us constantly
p33
aVbut invisible:
p34
aVthe vast network of air travel over the United States.
p35
aVWe can do the same thing with ships at sea.
p36
aVWe can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion.
p37
aVAnd decades of data give us the view of our entire planet
p38
aVas a single organism
p39
aVsustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans
p40
aVand by clouds swirling through the atmosphere,
p41
aVpulsing with lightning,
p42
aVcrowned by the aurora Borealis.
p43
aVIt may be the ultimate time-lapse image:
p44
aVthe anatomy of Earth brought to life.
p45
aa(lp46
VAt the other extreme,
p47
aVthere are things that move too fast for our eyes,
p48
aVbut we have technology that can look into that world as well.
p49
aVWith high-speed cameras,
p50
aVwe can do the opposite of time lapse.
p51
aVWe can shoot images
p52
aVthat are thousands of times faster than our vision.
p53
aVAnd we can see how nature's ingenious devices work,
p54
aVand perhaps we can even imitate them.
p55
aVWhen a dragonfly flutters by,
p56
aVyou may not realize,
p57
aVbut it's the greatest flier in nature.
p58
aVIt can hover, fly backwards,
p59
aVeven upside down.
p60
aVAnd by tracking markers on an insect's wings,
p61
aVwe can visualize the air flow that they produce.
p62
aVNobody knew the secret,
p63
aVbut high speed shows that a dragonfly
p64
aVcan move all four wings in different directions
p65
aVat the same time.
p66
aVAnd what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers
p67
aVthat can expand our vision
p68
aVof important and remote places.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe're giants,
p71
aVand we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see.
p72
aVThe electron microscope fires electrons which creates images
p73
aVwhich can magnify things by as much as a million times.
p74
aVThis is the egg of a butterfly.
p75
aVAnd there are unseen creatures living all over your body,
p76
aVincluding mites that spend their entire lives
p77
aVdwelling on your eyelashes,
p78
aVcrawling over your skin at night.
p79
aVCan you guess what this is?
p80
aVShark skin.
p81
aVA caterpillar's mouth.
p82
aVThe eye of a fruit fly.
p83
aVAn eggshell.
p84
aVA flea.
p85
aVA snail's tongue.
p86
aVWe think we know most of the animal kingdom,
p87
aVbut there may be millions of tiny species
p88
aVwaiting to be discovered.
p89
aa(lp90
VA spider also has great secrets,
p91
aVbecause spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel
p92
aVbut completely elastic.
p93
aVThis journey will take us all the way down to the nano world.
p94
aVThe silk is 100 times thinner than human hair.
p95
aVOn there is bacteria,
p96
aVand near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,
p97
aVa virus.
p98
aVInside of that, 10 times smaller,
p99
aVthree strands of DNA.
p100
aVAnd nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes,
p101
aVsingle carbon atoms.
p102
aa(lp103
VWith the tip of a powerful microscope,
p104
aVwe can actually move atoms
p105
aVand begin to create amazing nano devices.
p106
aVSome could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases
p107
aVand clean out clogged arteries along the way.
p108
aVTiny chemical machines of the future
p109
aVcan one day, perhaps, repair DNA.
p110
aVWe are on the threshold of extraordinary advances,
p111
aVborn of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo under an endless rain of cosmic dust,
p114
aVthe air is full of pollen,
p115
aVmicro-diamonds and jewels
p116
aVfrom other planets and supernova explosions.
p117
aVPeople go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable.
p118
aVKnowing that there's so much around us we can't see
p119
aVforever changes our understanding of the world,
p120
aVand by looking at unseen worlds,
p121
aVwe recognize that we exist in the living universe,
p122
aVand this new perspective creates wonder
p123
aVand inspires us to become explorers
p124
aVin our own backyards.
p125
aa(lp126
VWho knows what awaits to be seen
p127
aVand what new wonders will transform our lives.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe'll just have to see.
