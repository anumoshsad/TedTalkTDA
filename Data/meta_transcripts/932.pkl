VWhen I saw a piece of technology called Kinect \u2014
p4
aVit was called Natal \u2014 I was inspired,
p5
aVand I thought for a moment,
p6
aVmaybe it's possible
p7
aVto address that one problem of storytelling,
p8
aVto create a character
p9
aVwhich seemed alive,
p10
aVwhich noticed me,
p11
aVthat could look me in the eyes
p12
aVand feel real,
p13
aVand sculpt a story about our relationship.
p14
aVAnd so a year ago,
p15
aVI showed this off
p16
aVat a computer show called E3.
p17
aVAnd this was a piece of technology
p18
aVwith someone called Claire interacting with this boy.
p19
aVAnd there was a huge row online
p20
aVabout, "Hey, this can't be real."
p21
aVAnd so I waited till now
p22
aVto have an actual demo
p23
aVof the real tech.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, this tech incorporates
p26
aVthree big elements.
p27
aVThe first is a Kinect camera,
p28
aVwhich will be out in November,
p29
aVsome incredible AI
p30
aVthat was hidden in the dusty vaults,
p31
aVcollecting dust
p32
aVin Microsoft,
p33
aVplus our quite crude
p34
aVattempts at AI
p35
aVat a company called Lionhead,
p36
aVmixing all those things together
p37
aVjust to get to this one simple idea:
p38
aVto create a real, living
p39
aVbeing in a computer.
p40
aVNow, I'll be honest with you
p41
aVand say that most of it
p42
aVis just a trick,
p43
aVbut it's a trick that actually works.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo why don't we go over and have
p46
aVa look at the demo now.
p47
aVThis is Dimitri.
p48
aVDimitri, just waggle your arm around.
p49
aVNow, you notice he's sitting.
p50
aVThere are no controllers,
p51
aVno keyboards,
p52
aVor mice,
p53
aVor joysticks, or joypads.
p54
aVHe is just going to use
p55
aVhis hand, his body and his voice,
p56
aVjust like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let's move forward.
p59
aVYou're going to meet Milo for the first time.
p60
aVWe had to give him a problem
p61
aVbecause when we first created Milo,
p62
aVwe realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,
p63
aVto be honest with you.
p64
aVHe was quite a know-it-all,
p65
aVand he wanted to kind of make you laugh.
p66
aVSo the problem we introduced to him was this:
p67
aVhe's just moved house.
p68
aVHe's moved from London
p69
aVto New England, over in America.
p70
aVHis parents are too busy
p71
aVto listen to his problems,
p72
aVand that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.
p73
aVSo here he is
p74
aVwalking through the grass.
p75
aVAnd you're able to interact with his world.
p76
aVThe cool thing is, what we're doing
p77
aVis we're changing the mind
p78
aVof Milo constantly.
p79
aVThat means no two people's Milos
p80
aVcan be the same.
p81
aVYou're actually sculpting a human being here.
p82
aVSo, he's discovering the garden.
p83
aVYou're helping him discover the garden
p84
aVby just pointing out these snails.
p85
aVVery simple at the start.
p86
aVBy the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;
p87
aVif you're a girl, it's butterflies
p88
aVbecause what we found was that girls hate snails.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VSo remember, this is the first time you've met him,
p93
aVand we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.
p94
aVHis face, by the way,
p95
aVis fully AI-driven.
p96
aVWe have complete control over his blush responses,
p97
aVthe diameter of his nostrils
p98
aVto denote stress.
p99
aVWe actually do something called body matching.
p100
aVIf you're leaning forward,
p101
aVhe will try and slightly change
p102
aVthe neuro-linguistic nature of his face,
p103
aVbecause we went out with this strong idea:
p104
aVhow can we make you believe that something's real?
p105
aVNow we've used the hand.
p106
aVThe other thing to use is your body.
p107
aVWhy not just, instead of pushing left and right
p108
aVwith a mouse or with a joypad,
p109
aVwhy not use your body just to lean on the chair \u2014
p110
aVagain, relaxed?
p111
aVYou can lean back,
p112
aVbut the camera will change its perspective
p113
aVdepending on which way you're looking.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo Dimitri's now going to use \u2014
p116
aVhe's used his hand; he's used his body.
p117
aVHe's now going to use the other thing which is essential,
p118
aVand that's his voice.
p119
aVNow, the thing about voice is,
p120
aVour experience with voice recognition
p121
aVis pretty awful, isn't it?
p122
aVIt never works.
p123
aVYou order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.
p124
aVSo we've tackled that problem,
p125
aVand we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.
p126
aa(lp127
VMilo: I could just squish it.
p128
aa(lp129
VPeter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?
p130
aa(lp131
VFemale Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,
p132
aVbut remember, even this choice
p133
aVwill affect how Milo develops.
p134
aVDo you want Milo to squash it?
p135
aVWhen you see the microphone,
p136
aVsay ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.
p137
aa(lp138
VDimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.
p139
aa(lp140
VPM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.
p141
aVNow look at his response.
p142
aVHe said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."
p143
aVWhat we're using there is,
p144
aVwe're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.
p145
aVIt's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.
p146
aVWe've got a database of words which we recognize.
p147
aVWe pick those words out.
p148
aVWe also reference that
p149
aVwith the tonation database
p150
aVthat we build up of Dimitri's voice,
p151
aVor the user's voice.
p152
aVNow we need to have a bit more engagement,
p153
aVand again, what we can do
p154
aVis we can look at the body.
p155
aVAnd we'll do that in a second.
p156
aa(lp157
VMilo: I wonder how deep it is.
p158
aVDeep.
p159
aa(lp160
VPM: Okay. So what we're going to do now
p161
aVis teach Milo to skim stones.
p162
aVWe're actually teaching him.
p163
aVIt's very, very interesting
p164
aVthat men, more than women,
p165
aVtend to be more competitive here.
p166
aVThey're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,
p167
aVbut then they want to beat Milo,
p168
aVwhere women,
p169
aVthey're more nurturing about this.
p170
aVOkay, this is skimming stones.
p171
aVHow do you skim stones?
p172
aVYou stand up,
p173
aVand you skim the stone.
p174
aVIt's that simple.
p175
aVJust recognizing your body,
p176
aVrecognizing the body's motions, the tech,
p177
aVunderstanding that you've gone
p178
aVfrom sitting down to standing up.
p179
aVAgain, all of this is done
p180
aVin the way us humans do things,
p181
aVand that's crucially important
p182
aVif we want Milo to appear real.
p183
aa(lp184
VFemale Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.
p185
aVTry hitting the boat.
p186
aa(lp187
VMilo: Ahhh. So close.
p188
aa(lp189
VPM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.
p190
aVNow beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.
p191
aa(lp192
VMilo: Okay.
p193
aa(lp194
VPM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,
p195
aVgiving us time to be alone
p196
aVand to help him out.
p197
aVBasically \u2014 the bit that we missed at the start \u2014
p198
aVhis parents had asked him to clean up his room.
p199
aVAnd we're going to help him with this now.
p200
aVBut this is going to be an introduction,
p201
aVand this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.
p202
aVWe're trying to introduce you
p203
aVto what I believe is the most wonderful part,
p204
aVyou being able to talk
p205
aVin your natural voice to Milo.
p206
aVNow, to do that, we needed a set up,
p207
aVlike a magician's trick.
p208
aVAnd what we did was,
p209
aVwe needed to give Milo this big problem.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo as Dimitri
p212
aVstarts tidying up,
p213
aVyou can overhear a conversation
p214
aVthat Milo's having with his parents.
p215
aa(lp216
VMilo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)
p217
aa(lp218
VMilo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.
p219
aa(lp220
VPM: So he's just spilled
p221
aVa plate of sausages on the floor,
p222
aVon the brand-new carpet.
p223
aVWe've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.
p224
aVNow's a chance for Dimitri
p225
aVto kind of reassure and calm Milo down.
p226
aVIt's all been too much for him.
p227
aVHe's just moved house. He's got no friends.
p228
aVNow is the time
p229
aVwhen we open that portal
p230
aVand allow you to talk to Milo.
p231
aa(lp232
VFemale Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging
p233
aVto cheer Milo up.
p234
aa(lp235
VDimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.
p236
aVThey're always getting stressed.
p237
aa(lp238
VMilo: What do they want to come here for anyway?
p239
aVWe don't know anyone.
p240
aa(lp241
VDimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
p242
aVYou're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.
p243
aVMilo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.
p244
aa(lp245
VDimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.
p246
aVYou've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.
p247
aa(lp248
VMilo: It was good skimming stones.
p249
aVThis looks nice.
p250
aVYou cleaned up my room.
p251
aVThanks.
p252
aa(lp253
VPM: So after three-quarters of an hour,
p254
aVhe recognizes you.
p255
aVAnd I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,
p256
aVthat is a truly wonderful moment.
p257
aVAnd we're ready now
p258
aVto tell a story about his childhood and his life,
p259
aVand it goes on,
p260
aVand he has, you know, many adventures.
p261
aVSome of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.
p262
aVSome of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging \u2014
p263
aVhe's got to go to school.
p264
aa(lp265
VThe cool thing is
p266
aVthat we're doing as well:
p267
aVas you interact with him,
p268
aVyou're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.
p269
aVHis mind is based in a cloud.
p270
aVThat means Milo's mind,
p271
aVas millions of people use it,
p272
aVwill get smarter and cleverer.
p273
aVHe'll recognize more objects
p274
aVand thus understand more words.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut for me,
p277
aVthis is a wonderful opportunity
p278
aVwhere technology, at last, can be connected with,
p279
aVwhere I am no longer restrained
p280
aVby the finger I hold in my hand \u2014
p281
aVas far as a computer game's concerned \u2014
p282
aVor by the blandness of not being noticed
p283
aVif you're watching a film or a book.
p284
aVAnd I love those revolutions,
p285
aVand I love the future that Milo brings.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you very much indeed.
p288
aa(lp289
