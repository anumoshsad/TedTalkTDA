VHow many of you are creatives,
p4
aVdesigners, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists,
p5
aVor maybe you just have a really big imagination?
p6
aVShow of hands? (Cheers)
p7
aa(lp8
VThat's most of you.
p9
aVI have some news for us creatives.
p10
aVOver the course of the next 20 years,
p11
aVmore will change around the way we do our work
p12
aVthan has happened in the last 2,000.
p13
aVIn fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.
p16
aVThe Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years.
p17
aVAnd then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years.
p18
aVThe Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries.
p19
aVAnd now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades.
p20
aVAnd now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.
p21
aa(lp22
VWelcome to the Augmented Age.
p23
aVIn this new era, your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented
p24
aVby computational systems that help you think,
p25
aVrobotic systems that help you make,
p26
aVand a digital nervous system
p27
aVthat connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.
p28
aVLet's start with cognitive augmentation.
p29
aVHow many of you are augmented cyborgs?
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VI would actually argue that we're already augmented.
p34
aVImagine you're at a party,
p35
aVand somebody asks you a question that you don't know the answer to.
p36
aVIf you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.
p37
aVBut this is just a primitive beginning.
p38
aVEven Siri is just a passive tool.
p39
aVIn fact, for the last three-and-a-half million years,
p40
aVthe tools that we've had have been completely passive.
p41
aVThey do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.
p42
aVOur very first tool only cut where we struck it.
p43
aVThe chisel only carves where the artist points it.
p44
aVAnd even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.
p45
aVIn fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,
p46
aVwe've always been limited
p47
aVby this need to manually push our wills into our tools \u2014
p48
aVlike, manual, literally using our hands,
p49
aVeven with computers.
p50
aVBut I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VI want to have a conversation with a computer.
p55
aVI want to say, "Computer, let's design a car,"
p56
aVand the computer shows me a car.
p57
aVAnd I say, "No, more fast-looking, and less German,"
p58
aVand bang, the computer shows me an option.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VThat conversation might be a little ways off,
p63
aVprobably less than many of us think,
p64
aVbut right now,
p65
aVwe're working on it.
p66
aVTools are making this leap from being passive to being generative.
p67
aVGenerative design tools use a computer and algorithms
p68
aVto synthesize geometry
p69
aVto come up with new designs all by themselves.
p70
aVAll it needs are your goals and your constraints.
p71
aa(lp72
VI'll give you an example.
p73
aVIn the case of this aerial drone chassis,
p74
aVall you would need to do is tell it something like,
p75
aVit has four propellers,
p76
aVyou want it to be as lightweight as possible,
p77
aVand you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.
p78
aVThen what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space:
p79
aVevery single possibility that solves and meets your criteria \u2014
p80
aVmillions of them.
p81
aVIt takes big computers to do this.
p82
aVBut it comes back to us with designs
p83
aVthat we, by ourselves, never could've imagined.
p84
aVAnd the computer's coming up with this stuff all by itself \u2014
p85
aVno one ever drew anything,
p86
aVand it started completely from scratch.
p87
aVAnd by the way, it's no accident
p88
aVthat the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VIt's because the algorithms are designed to work
p93
aVthe same way evolution does.
p94
aa(lp95
VWhat's exciting is we're starting to see this technology
p96
aVout in the real world.
p97
aVWe've been working with Airbus for a couple of years
p98
aVon this concept plane for the future.
p99
aVIt's a ways out still.
p100
aVBut just recently we used a generative-design AI
p101
aVto come up with this.
p102
aVThis is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.
p103
aVIt's stronger than the original yet half the weight,
p104
aVand it will be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.
p105
aVSo computers can now generate;
p106
aVthey can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.
p107
aVBut they're not intuitive.
p108
aVThey still have to start from scratch every single time,
p109
aVand that's because they never learn.
p110
aVUnlike Maggie.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VMaggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools.
p115
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p116
aVIf her owner picks up that leash,
p117
aVMaggie knows with a fair degree of certainty
p118
aVit's time to go for a walk.
p119
aVAnd how did she learn?
p120
aVWell, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk.
p121
aVAnd Maggie did three things:
p122
aVshe had to pay attention,
p123
aVshe had to remember what happened
p124
aVand she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.
p125
aa(lp126
VInterestingly, that's exactly what
p127
aVcomputer scientists have been trying to get AIs to do
p128
aVfor the last 60 or so years.
p129
aVBack in 1952,
p130
aVthey built this computer that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.
p131
aVBig deal.
p132
aVThen 45 years later, in 1997,
p133
aVDeep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.
p134
aV2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy,
p135
aVwhich is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.
p136
aVIn fact, rather than working from predefined recipes,
p137
aVWatson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.
p138
aVAnd then a couple of weeks ago,
p139
aVDeepMind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go,
p140
aVwhich is the most difficult game that we have.
p141
aVIn fact, in Go, there are more possible moves
p142
aVthan there are atoms in the universe.
p143
aVSo in order to win,
p144
aVwhat AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.
p145
aVAnd in fact, at some points, AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand
p146
aVwhy AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd things are moving really fast.
p149
aVI mean, consider \u2014 in the space of a human lifetime,
p150
aVcomputers have gone from a child's game
p151
aVto what's recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought.
p152
aVWhat's basically happening
p153
aVis computers are going from being like Spock
p154
aVto being a lot more like Kirk.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VRight? From pure logic to intuition.
p159
aVWould you cross this bridge?
p160
aVMost of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!"
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd you arrived at that decision in a split second.
p165
aVYou just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe.
p166
aVAnd that's exactly the kind of intuition
p167
aVthat our deep-learning systems are starting to develop right now.
p168
aVVery soon, you'll literally be able
p169
aVto show something you've made, you've designed,
p170
aVto a computer,
p171
aVand it will look at it and say,
p172
aV"Sorry, homie, that'll never work. You have to try again."
p173
aVOr you could ask it if people are going to like your next song,
p174
aVor your next flavor of ice cream.
p175
aVOr, much more importantly,
p176
aVyou could work with a computer to solve a problem
p177
aVthat we've never faced before.
p178
aVFor instance, climate change.
p179
aVWe're not doing a very good job on our own,
p180
aVwe could certainly use all the help we can get.
p181
aVThat's what I'm talking about,
p182
aVtechnology amplifying our cognitive abilities
p183
aVso we can imagine and design things that were simply out of our reach
p184
aVas plain old un-augmented humans.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo what about making all of this crazy new stuff
p187
aVthat we're going to invent and design?
p188
aVI think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world
p189
aVas it is about the virtual, intellectual realm.
p190
aVHow will technology augment us?
p191
aVIn the physical world, robotic systems.
p192
aVOK, there's certainly a fear
p193
aVthat robots are going to take jobs away from humans,
p194
aVand that is true in certain sectors.
p195
aVBut I'm much more interested in this idea
p196
aVthat humans and robots working together are going to augment each other,
p197
aVand start to inhabit a new space.
p198
aa(lp199
VThis is our applied research lab in San Francisco,
p200
aVwhere one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,
p201
aVspecifically, human-robot collaboration.
p202
aVAnd this is Bishop, one of our robots.
p203
aVAs an experiment, we set it up
p204
aVto help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks \u2014
p205
aVtasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, Bishop's human partner can tell what to do in plain English
p210
aVand with simple gestures,
p211
aVkind of like talking to a dog,
p212
aVand then Bishop executes on those instructions
p213
aVwith perfect precision.
p214
aVWe're using the human for what the human is good at:
p215
aVawareness, perception and decision making.
p216
aVAnd we're using the robot for what it's good at:
p217
aVprecision and repetitiveness.
p218
aa(lp219
VHere's another cool project that Bishop worked on.
p220
aVThe goal of this project, which we called the HIVE,
p221
aVwas to prototype the experience of humans, computers and robots
p222
aVall working together to solve a highly complex design problem.
p223
aVThe humans acted as labor.
p224
aVThey cruised around the construction site, they manipulated the bamboo \u2014
p225
aVwhich, by the way, because it's a non-isomorphic material,
p226
aVis super hard for robots to deal with.
p227
aVBut then the robots did this fiber winding,
p228
aVwhich was almost impossible for a human to do.
p229
aVAnd then we had an AI that was controlling everything.
p230
aVIt was telling the humans what to do, telling the robots what to do
p231
aVand keeping track of thousands of individual components.
p232
aVWhat's interesting is,
p233
aVbuilding this pavilion was simply not possible
p234
aVwithout human, robot and AI augmenting each other.
p235
aa(lp236
VOK, I'll share one more project. This one's a little bit crazy.
p237
aVWe're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D
p238
aVto generatively design and robotically print
p239
aVthe world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.
p240
aVSo, Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now, as we speak,
p241
aVin Amsterdam.
p242
aVAnd when they're done, we're going to hit "Go,"
p243
aVand robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,
p244
aVand then they're going to keep printing, without human intervention,
p245
aVuntil the bridge is finished.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo, as computers are going to augment our ability
p248
aVto imagine and design new stuff,
p249
aVrobotic systems are going to help us build and make things
p250
aVthat we've never been able to make before.
p251
aVBut what about our ability to sense and control these things?
p252
aVWhat about a nervous system for the things that we make?
p253
aa(lp254
VOur nervous system, the human nervous system,
p255
aVtells us everything that's going on around us.
p256
aVBut the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best.
p257
aVFor instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department
p258
aVthat it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway and Morrison.
p259
aVA building doesn't tell its designers
p260
aVwhether or not the people inside like being there,
p261
aVand the toy manufacturer doesn't know
p262
aVif a toy is actually being played with \u2014
p263
aVhow and where and whether or not it's any fun.
p264
aVLook, I'm sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for Barbie
p265
aVwhen they designed her.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VBut what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VIf the designers had known
p274
aVwhat was really happening in the real world
p275
aVwith their designs \u2014 the road, the building, Barbie \u2014
p276
aVthey could've used that knowledge to create an experience
p277
aVthat was better for the user.
p278
aVWhat's missing is a nervous system
p279
aVconnecting us to all of the things that we design, make and use.
p280
aVWhat if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you
p281
aVfrom the things you create in the real world?
p282
aVWith all of the stuff we make,
p283
aVwe spend a tremendous amount of money and energy \u2014
p284
aVin fact, last year, about two trillion dollars \u2014
p285
aVconvincing people to buy the things we've made.
p286
aVBut if you had this connection to the things that you design and create
p287
aVafter they're out in the real world,
p288
aVafter they've been sold or launched or whatever,
p289
aVwe could actually change that,
p290
aVand go from making people want our stuff,
p291
aVto just making stuff that people want in the first place.
p292
aa(lp293
VThe good news is, we're working on digital nervous systems
p294
aVthat connect us to the things we design.
p295
aVWe're working on one project
p296
aVwith a couple of guys down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers
p297
aVand their team.
p298
aVAnd one of the things these guys do is build insane cars
p299
aVthat do absolutely insane things.
p300
aVThese guys are crazy \u2014
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
Vin the best way.
p305
aVAnd what we're doing with them
p306
aVis taking a traditional race-car chassis
p307
aVand giving it a nervous system.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo we instrumented it with dozens of sensors,
p310
aVput a world-class driver behind the wheel,
p311
aVtook it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.
p312
aVAnd the car's nervous system captured everything
p313
aVthat was happening to the car.
p314
aVWe captured four billion data points;
p315
aVall of the forces that it was subjected to.
p316
aVAnd then we did something crazy.
p317
aVWe took all of that data,
p318
aVand plugged it into a generative-design AI we call "Dreamcatcher."
p319
aVSo what do get when you give a design tool a nervous system,
p320
aVand you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis?
p321
aVYou get this.
p322
aVThis is something that a human could never have designed.
p323
aVExcept a human did design this,
p324
aVbut it was a human that was augmented by a generative-design AI,
p325
aVa digital nervous system
p326
aVand robots that can actually fabricate something like this.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo if this is the future, the Augmented Age,
p329
aVand we're going to be augmented cognitively, physically and perceptually,
p330
aVwhat will that look like?
p331
aVWhat is this wonderland going to be like?
p332
aa(lp333
VI think we're going to see a world
p334
aVwhere we're moving from things that are fabricated
p335
aVto things that are farmed.
p336
aVWhere we're moving from things that are constructed
p337
aVto that which is grown.
p338
aVWe're going to move from being isolated
p339
aVto being connected.
p340
aVAnd we'll move away from extraction
p341
aVto embrace aggregation.
p342
aVI also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things
p343
aVto valuing autonomy.
p344
aa(lp345
VThanks to our augmented capabilities,
p346
aVour world is going to change dramatically.
p347
aVWe're going to have a world with more variety, more connectedness,
p348
aVmore dynamism, more complexity,
p349
aVmore adaptability and, of course,
p350
aVmore beauty.
p351
aVThe shape of things to come
p352
aVwill be unlike anything we've ever seen before.
p353
aVWhy?
p354
aVBecause what will be shaping those things is this new partnership
p355
aVbetween technology, nature and humanity.
p356
aVThat, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you all so much.
