VI love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.
p4
aVWe all know the Earth is in trouble.
p5
aVWe have now entered in the 6X,
p6
aVthe sixth major extinction on this planet.
p7
aVI often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms \u2014
p8
aVotherwise known as "Uh-Oh" \u2014
p9
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and every organism had a right to vote,
p10
aVwould we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?
p11
aVI think that vote is occurring right now.
p12
aa(lp13
VI want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,
p14
aVusing fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.
p15
aVThe mycelium infuses all landscapes,
p16
aVit holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.
p17
aVThis holds up to 30,000 times its mass.
p18
aVThey're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature \u2014 the soil magicians.
p19
aVThey generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.
p20
aVWe have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer
p21
aVof nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium \u2014
p22
aVso the mycelium is the mother
p23
aVthat is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees
p24
aVto hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.
p25
aa(lp26
VDusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.
p27
aVI'm in love with the old-growth forest,
p28
aVand I'm a patriotic American because we have those.
p29
aVMost of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.
p30
aVAnd frankly, I face a big obstacle.
p31
aVWhen I mention mushrooms to somebody,
p32
aVthey immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,
p33
aVtheir eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.
p34
aVSo, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.
p35
aVWe call it mycophobia,
p36
aVthe irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.
p37
aa(lp38
VMushrooms are very fast in their growth.
p39
aVDay 21, day 23, day 25.
p40
aVMushrooms produce strong antibiotics.
p41
aVIn fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.
p42
aVA group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists
p43
aVpublished a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta \u2014
p44
aVa super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.
p45
aVWe share in common the same pathogens.
p46
aVFungi don't like to rot from bacteria,
p47
aVand so our best antibiotics come from fungi.
p48
aVBut here is a mushroom that's past its prime.
p49
aVAfter they sporulate, they do rot.
p50
aVBut I propose to you that the sequence of microbes
p51
aVthat occur on rotting mushrooms
p52
aVare essential for the health of the forest.
p53
aVThey give rise to the trees,
p54
aVthey create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd so we see a mushroom here sporulating.
p57
aVAnd the spores are germinating,
p58
aVand the mycelium forms and goes underground.
p59
aVIn a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.
p60
aVMy foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.
p61
aa(lp62
VThis is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.
p63
aVAnd notice that as the mycelium grows,
p64
aVit conquers territory and then it begins the net.
p65
aVI've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,
p66
aVI have thousands of electron micrographs,
p67
aVand when I'm staring at the mycelium,
p68
aVI realize that they are microfiltration membranes.
p69
aVWe exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
p70
aVIt inhales oxygen, just like we do.
p71
aVBut these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.
p72
aVAnd I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.
p73
aVAnd in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,
p74
aVand as they fuse soils, they absorb water.
p75
aVThese are little wells.
p76
aVAnd inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.
p77
aVAnd so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,
p78
aVbut sets up a microbial universe
p79
aVthat gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.
p80
aa(lp81
VI first proposed, in the early 1990s,
p82
aVthat mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.
p83
aVWhen you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.
p84
aVAnd if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,
p85
aVbecause of the nodes of crossing \u2014
p86
aVInternet engineers maybe call them hot points \u2014
p87
aVthere are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
p88
aVThe mycelium is sentient.
p89
aVIt knows that you are there.
p90
aVWhen you walk across landscapes,
p91
aVit leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.
p92
aVSo, I believe the invention of the computer Internet
p93
aVis an inevitable consequence
p94
aVof a previously proven, biologically successful model.
p95
aVThe Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,
p96
aVand we now, being the top organism on this planet,
p97
aVare trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.
p98
aa(lp99
VGoing way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.
p100
aVI believe matter begets life;
p101
aVlife becomes single cells; single cells become strings;
p102
aVstrings become chains; chains network.
p103
aVAnd this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.
p104
aa(lp105
VMost of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.
p106
aVThey came to land 1.3 billion years ago,
p107
aVand plants followed several hundred million years later.
p108
aVHow is that possible?
p109
aVIt's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,
p110
aVand many other acids and enzymes,
p111
aVpockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals
p112
aVand forming calcium oxalates.
p113
aVMakes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.
p114
aVOxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.
p115
aVSo, fungi and mycelium
p116
aVsequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.
p117
aVAnd all sorts of other oxalates
p118
aVare also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals
p119
aVthat are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis was first discovered in 1859.
p122
aVThis is a photograph by Franz Hueber.
p123
aVThis photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.
p124
aV420 million years ago, this organism existed.
p125
aVIt was called Prototaxites.
p126
aVPrototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.
p127
aVThe tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.
p128
aVDr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,
p129
aVpublished an article in the Journal of Geology
p130
aVthis past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,
p131
aVa giant mushroom.
p132
aVAcross the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.
p133
aVAll across most land masses.
p134
aVAnd these existed for tens of millions of years.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward \u2014
p137
aV65 million years ago \u2014 most of you know about it \u2014
p138
aVwe had an asteroid impact.
p139
aVThe Earth was struck by an asteroid,
p140
aVa huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.
p141
aVSunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.
p142
aVThose organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,
p143
aVbecause fungi do not need light.
p144
aVMore recently, at Einstein University,
p145
aVthey just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,
p146
aVmuch like plants use light.
p147
aVSo, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,
p148
aVI think, is a forgone conclusion,
p149
aVat least in my own mind.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.
p152
aVI couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:
p153
aV2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.
p154
aVThe largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.
p155
aVHow is it that this organism can be so large,
p156
aVand yet be one cell wall thick,
p157
aVwhereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
p158
aVThe mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom \u2014
p159
aVit bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.
p160
aVWe were involved with several experiments.
p161
aVI'm going to show you six, if I can,
p162
aVsolutions for helping to save the world.
p163
aVBattelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.
p164
aVThere were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:
p165
aVone was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;
p166
aVone pile was treated with bacteria;
p167
aVand our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.
p168
aVThe mycelium absorbs the oil.
p169
aVThe mycelium is producing enzymes \u2014
p170
aVperoxidases \u2014 that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.
p171
aVThese are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
p172
aVSo, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,
p173
aVand then, when we returned six weeks later,
p174
aVall the tarps were removed,
p175
aVall the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.
p176
aVWe came back to our pile, it was covered
p177
aVwith hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,
p178
aVand the color changed to a light form.
p179
aVThe enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons
p180
aVinto carbohydrates \u2014 fungal sugars.
p181
aa(lp182
VSome of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.
p183
aVThey're very large.
p184
aVThey're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.
p185
aVBut something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.
p186
aVThey sporulated, the spores attract insects,
p187
aVthe insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.
p188
aVBirds then came, bringing in seeds,
p189
aVand our pile became an oasis of life.
p190
aVWhereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,
p191
aVand the PAH's \u2014 the aromatic hydrocarbons \u2014
p192
aVwent from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.
p193
aVThe last image we don't have.
p194
aVThe entire pile was a green berm of life.
p195
aVThese are gateway species,
p196
aVvanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn \u2014
p199
aVand putting the mycelium \u2014 using storm blown debris,
p200
aVyou can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream
p201
aVfrom a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,
p202
aVor a factory with chemical toxins,
p203
aVand it leads to habitat restoration.
p204
aVSo, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,
p205
aVand we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.
p206
aVAnd I'll show you a graph here.
p207
aVThis is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.
p208
aVThere's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,
p209
aVand 10 to the third power is around 1,000.
p210
aVIn 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species
p211
aVreduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.
p212
aVThink of the implications.
p213
aVThis is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris \u2014
p214
aVand we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.
p217
aVThis is my wife Dusty,
p218
aVwith a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis \u2014 Agarikon.
p219
aVIt's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest
p220
aVthat Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.
p221
aVas a treatment against consumption.
p222
aVThis mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,
p223
aVnorthern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.
p224
aVMay not seem that large \u2014
p225
aVlet's get closer.
p226
aVThis is extremely rare fungus.
p227
aVOur team \u2014 and we have a team of experts that go out \u2014
p228
aVwe went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.
p229
aVWe found one sample to be able to get into culture.
p230
aa(lp231
VPreserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest
p232
aVI think is absolutely critical for human health.
p233
aVI've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.
p234
aVWe submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,
p235
aVand mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.
p236
aVAnd a few years ago,
p237
aVwe received these results.
p238
aVWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
p239
aVthat were highly active against poxviruses.
p240
aVDr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert
p241
aVof the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds
p242
aVthat have a selectivity index of two or more are active.
p243
aV10 or greater are considered to be very active.
p244
aVOur mushroom strains were in the highly active range.
p245
aVThere's a vetted press release that you can read \u2014
p246
aVit's vetted by DOD \u2014
p247
aVif you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."
p248
aVOr you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.
p251
aVAnd so, for the first time, I am showing this.
p252
aVWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
p253
aVhighly active against flu viruses.
p254
aVHere's the selectivity index numbers \u2014
p255
aVagainst pox, you saw 10s and 20s \u2014 now against flu viruses,
p256
aVcompared to the ribavirin controls,
p257
aVwe have an extraordinarily high activity.
p258
aVAnd we're using a natural extract
p259
aVwithin the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.
p260
aVWe tried it against flu A viruses \u2014 H1N1, H3N2 \u2014
p261
aVas well as flu B viruses.
p262
aVSo then we tried a blend,
p263
aVand in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,
p264
aVand we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aVI then think that we can make the argument
p267
aVthat we should save the old-growth forest
p268
aVas a matter of national defense.
p269
aV(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VI became interested in entomopathogenic fungi \u2014
p272
aVfungi that kill insects.
p273
aVOur house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.
p274
aVSo, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies
p275
aVwith metarhizium species of a group of fungi
p276
aVthat kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.
p277
aVI did something that nobody else had done.
p278
aVI actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.
p279
aVThese are spores \u2014 this is in their spores.
p280
aVI was able to morph the culture
p281
aVinto a non-sporulating form.
p282
aVAnd so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars
p283
aVspecifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.
p284
aVBut the insects aren't stupid,
p285
aVand they would avoid the spores when they came close,
p286
aVand so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.
p287
aVAnd I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,
p288
aVI put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants
p289
aVwere making debris fields, every day,
p290
aVin my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,
p291
aVbecause there's no spores.
p292
aVThey gave it to the queen.
p293
aVOne week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd then \u2014 a delicate dance between dinner and death \u2014
p296
aVthe mycelium is consumed by the ants,
p297
aVthey become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aVNow after sporulation, the spores repel.
p300
aVSo, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.
p301
aVSo, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.
p302
aVAnd so my house came down, I received my first patent
p303
aVagainst carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.
p304
aVThen we tried extracts, and lo and behold,
p305
aVwe can steer insects to different directions.
p306
aVThis has huge implications.
p307
aVI then received my second patent \u2014 and this is a big one.
p308
aVIt's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
p309
aVIt covers over 200,000 species.
p310
aVThis is the most disruptive technology \u2014
p311
aVI've been told by executives of the pesticide industry \u2014
p312
aVthat they have ever witnessed.
p313
aVThis could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
p314
aVYou could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,
p315
aVbecause my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,
p316
aVprior to sporulation, attract the very insects
p317
aVthat are otherwise repelled by those spores.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.
p320
aVThe Life Box \u2014 you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference \u2014
p321
aVyou add soil, you add water,
p322
aVyou have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,
p323
aVlike of the Agarikon mushroom.
p324
aVThe seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
p325
aVAnd then you put tree seeds in here,
p326
aVand then you end up growing \u2014 potentially \u2014
p327
aVan old-growth forest from a cardboard box.
p328
aa(lp329
VI want to reinvent the delivery system,
p330
aVand the use of cardboard around the world,
p331
aVso they become ecological footprints.
p332
aVIf there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,
p333
aVyou could make it interactive, zip code specific \u2014
p334
aVwhere people could join together,
p335
aVand through satellite imaging systems,
p336
aVthrough Virtual Earth or Google Earth,
p337
aVyou could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered
p338
aVby the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.
p339
aa(lp340
VYou could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,
p341
aVyou could add water \u2014 I developed this for the refugee community \u2014
p342
aVcorns, beans and squash and onions.
p343
aVI took several containers \u2014 my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could \u2014
p344
aVand I ended up growing a seed garden.
p345
aVThen you harvest the seeds \u2014
p346
aVand thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this \u2014
p347
aVand then you're harvesting the seed garden.
p348
aVThen you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.
p349
aVI add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.
p350
aVNow, three corncobs, no other grain \u2014
p351
aVlots of mushrooms begin to form.
p352
aVToo many withdrawals from the carbon bank,
p353
aVand so this population will be shut down.
p354
aVBut watch what happens here.
p355
aVThe mushrooms then are harvested,
p356
aVbut very importantly,
p357
aVthe mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.
p358
aVAnd so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?
p359
aVAnd we came up with Econol.
p360
aa(lp361
VGenerating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary \u2014
p362
aVand you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.
p363
aVBut to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,
p364
aVand I think that we need to be econologically intelligent
p365
aVabout the generation of fuels.
p366
aVSo, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.
p367
aVThese are a species that we need to join with.
p368
aVI think engaging mycelium can help save the world.
p369
aVThank you very much.
