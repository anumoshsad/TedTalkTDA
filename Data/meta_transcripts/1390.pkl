VThe recent debate over copyright laws
p4
aVlike SOPA in the United States
p5
aVand the ACTA agreement in Europe
p6
aVhas been very emotional.
p7
aVAnd I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning
p8
aVcould really bring a great deal to the debate.
p9
aVI'd therefore like to propose
p10
aVthat we employ, we enlist,
p11
aVthe cutting edge field of copyright math
p12
aVwhenever we approach this subject.
p13
aa(lp14
VFor instance, just recently
p15
aVthe Motion Picture Association revealed
p16
aVthat our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year
p17
aVto copyright theft.
p18
aVNow rather than just argue about this number,
p19
aVa copyright mathematician will analyze it
p20
aVand he'll soon discover that this money
p21
aVcould stretch from this auditorium
p22
aVall the way across Ocean Boulevard
p23
aVto the Westin, and then to Mars ...
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aV... if we use pennies.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow this is obviously a powerful,
p28
aVsome might say dangerously powerful, insight.
p29
aVBut it's also a morally important one.
p30
aVBecause this isn't just the hypothetical retail value
p31
aVof some pirated movies that we're talking about,
p32
aVbut this is actual economic losses.
p33
aVThis is the equivalent
p34
aVto the entire American corn crop failing
p35
aValong with all of our fruit crops,
p36
aVas well as wheat, tobacco,
p37
aVrice, sorghum \u2014
p38
aVwhatever sorghum is \u2014 losing sorghum.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut identifying the actual losses to the economy
p41
aVis almost impossible to do
p42
aVunless we use copyright math.
p43
aVNow music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year
p44
aVsince Napster first came on the scene.
p45
aVSo that's a chunk of what we're looking for.
p46
aVBut total movie revenues
p47
aVacross theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.
p48
aVAnd TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.
p49
aVOther content markets like book publishing and radio
p50
aVare also up.
p51
aVSo this small missing chunk here
p52
aVis puzzling.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VSince the big content markets
p59
aVhave grown in line with historic norms,
p60
aVit's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,
p61
aVbut copyright math tells us
p62
aVit must therefore be foregone growth
p63
aVin a market that has no historic norms \u2014
p64
aVone that didn't exist in the 90's.
p65
aVWhat we're looking at here
p66
aVis the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aV50 billion dollars of it a year,
p69
aVwhich is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,
p70
aVthat could stretch from here
p71
aVto Neanderthal times.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVIt's true.
p74
aV(Applause)
p75
aVI have Excel.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VThe movie folks also tell us
p80
aVthat our economy loses
p81
aVover 370,000 jobs to content theft,
p82
aVwhich is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,
p83
aVthe Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated
p84
aVthat the motion picture and video industries
p85
aVwere employing 270,000 people.
p86
aVOther data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.
p87
aVAnd so the job losses that came with the Internet
p88
aVand all that content theft,
p89
aVhave therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.
p90
aVAnd this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics
p91
aVthat copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.
p92
aVAnd some people think that string theory is tough.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VNow this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.
p97
aVIt's the precise amount of harm
p98
aVthat comes to media companies
p99
aVwhenever a single copyrighted song or movie
p100
aVgets pirated.
p101
aVHollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically
p102
aVback when they last sat down to improve copyright damages
p103
aVand made this law.
p104
aVSome people think this number's a little bit large,
p105
aVbut copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts
p106
aVare merely surprised
p107
aVthat it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow when this law first passed,
p110
aVthe world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.
p111
aVAnd it was a big Christmas hit.
p112
aVBecause what little hoodlum wouldn't want
p113
aVa million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
V(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VThese days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,
p120
aVwhich is to say eight billion dollars-worth
p121
aVof stolen media.
p122
aV(Applause)
p123
aVOr about 75,000 jobs.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VNow you might find copyright math strange,
p130
aVbut that's because it's a field
p131
aVthat's best left to experts.
p132
aVSo that's it for now.
p133
aVI hope you'll join me next time
p134
aVwhen I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry
p135
aVinto the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.
p136
aa(lp137
VThank you very much.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
