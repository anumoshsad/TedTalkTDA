VI love my food.
p4
aVAnd I love information.
p5
aVMy children usually tell me
p6
aVthat one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBut what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so
p10
aVis to take you through how those passions developed,
p11
aVthe point in my life when the two passions merged,
p12
aVthe journey of learning that took place from that point.
p13
aVAnd one idea I want to leave you with today
p14
aVis what would would happen differently in your life
p15
aVif you saw information the way you saw food?
p16
aa(lp17
VI was born in Calcutta \u2014
p18
aVa family where my father and his father before him
p19
aVwere journalists,
p20
aVand they wrote magazines in the English language.
p21
aVThat was the family business.
p22
aVAnd as a result of that,
p23
aVI grew up with books everywhere around the house.
p24
aVAnd I mean books everywhere around the house.
p25
aVAnd that's actually a shop in Calcutta,
p26
aVbut it's a place where we like our books.
p27
aVIn fact, I've got 38,000 of them now
p28
aVand no Kindle in sight.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,
p31
aVwith people to talk to about those books,
p32
aVthis wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.
p33
aa(lp34
VBy the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.
p35
aVIt wasn't the only passion I had.
p36
aVI was a South Indian
p37
aVbrought up in Bengal.
p38
aVAnd two of the things about Bengal:
p39
aVthey like their savory dishes
p40
aVand they like their sweets.
p41
aVSo by the time I grew up,
p42
aVagain, I had a well-established passion for food.
p43
aVNow I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,
p44
aVand there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,
p45
aVbut these two were the ones that differentiated me.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd then life was fine, dandy.
p49
aVEverything was okay,
p50
aVuntil I got to about the age of 26,
p51
aVand I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."
p52
aVOh, some of you have seen it.
p53
aVAnd apparently it's being remade right now
p54
aVand it's going to be coming out next year.
p55
aVIt's the story of this experimental robot
p56
aVwhich got electrocuted and found a life.
p57
aVAnd as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input."
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I suddenly realized that for a robot
p60
aVboth information as well as food
p61
aVwere the same thing.
p62
aVEnergy came to it in some form or shape,
p63
aVdata came to it in some form or shape.
p64
aVAnd I began to think,
p65
aVI wonder what it would be like
p66
aVto start imagining myself
p67
aVas if energy and information were the two things I had as input \u2014
p68
aVas if food and information were similar in some form or shape.
p69
aa(lp70
VI started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,
p71
aVand started finding out
p72
aVthat actually human beings as primates
p73
aVhave far smaller stomachs
p74
aVthan should be the size for our body weight
p75
aVand far larger brains.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd as I went to research that even further,
p78
aVI got to a point where I discovered something
p79
aVcalled the expensive tissue hypothesis.
p80
aVThat actually for a given body mass of a primate
p81
aVthe metabolic rate was static.
p82
aVWhat changed was the balance of the tissues available.
p83
aVAnd two of the most expensive tissues in our human body
p84
aVare nervous tissue and digestive tissue.
p85
aVAnd what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis
p86
aVthat was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.
p87
aVIt's a lady named Leslie Aiello.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.
p90
aVIf you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,
p91
aVyou had to live with a smaller gut.
p92
aa(lp93
VThat then set me off completely
p94
aVto say, Okay, these two are connected.
p95
aVSo I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food
p96
aVand said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.
p97
aVWe moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.
p98
aa(lp99
VDoes that really explain what we're seeing
p100
aVwith the intellectual property battles nowadays?
p101
aVBecause those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin
p102
aVwanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,
p103
aVand those that were in the business of farming information
p104
aVwanted to build fences around it,
p105
aVcreate ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.
p106
aVSo there was always going to be a tension within that.
p107
aVAnd everything I saw in the cultivation
p108
aVsaid there were huge fights amongst the foodies
p109
aVbetween the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.
p110
aVAnd this is happening here.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhen I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,
p113
aVexpect that there were two schools.
p114
aVOne group of people said you can distill your information,
p115
aVyou can extract value, separate it and serve it up,
p116
aVwhile another group turned around
p117
aVand said no, no you can ferment it.
p118
aVYou bring it all together and mash it up
p119
aVand the value emerges that way.
p120
aVThe same is again true with information.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.
p123
aVBecause what I began to see then
p124
aVwas there were so many different ways people would consume this.
p125
aVThey'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.
p126
aVDo you cook it? Do you have it served to you?
p127
aVDo you go to a restaurant?
p128
aVThe same is true every time as I started thinking about information.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe analogies were getting crazy \u2014
p131
aVthat information had sell-by dates,
p132
aVthat people had misused information that wasn't dated properly
p133
aVand could really make an effect on the stock market,
p134
aVon corporate values, etc.
p135
aVAnd by this time I was hooked.
p136
aVAnd this is about 23 years into this process.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd I began to start thinking of myself
p139
aVas we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,
p140
aVdocu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.
p141
aVAre we going to reach the stage
p142
aVwhere information has a percentage for fact associated with it?
p143
aVWe start labeling information for the fact percentage?
p144
aVAre we going to start looking at what happens
p145
aVwhen your information source is turned off, as a famine?
p146
aa(lp147
VWhich brings me to the final element of this.
p148
aVClay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,
p149
aVthere is only filter failure.
p150
aVI put it to you that information,
p151
aVif viewed from the point of food,
p152
aVis never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.
p153
aVFundamentally it's a consumption issue.
p154
aVAnd we have to start thinking
p155
aVabout how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,
p156
aVto have the faculties to be able to deal with information,
p157
aVto have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.
p158
aVIn fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying,
p159
aVWhat would happen
p160
aVif an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVWould there be time to be able to work with it?
p163
aa(lp164
VSo you start really understanding
p165
aVthat you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,
p166
aVand once you start looking, and from that point on,
p167
aVeverything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,
p168
aVthe production of information, the preparation of information,
p169
aVI've looked at from the viewpoint of food.
p170
aVIt has probably not helped my waistline any
p171
aVbecause I like practicing on both sides.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut I'd like to leave you with just that question:
p174
aVIf you began to think of all the information that you consume
p175
aVthe way you think of food,
p176
aVwhat would you do differently?
p177
aa(lp178
VThank you very much for your time.
