VThis is your conference,
p4
aVand I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,
p5
aVabout this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.
p6
aVSo, I'm just going to grab a chair here.

aa(lp8
VTwo years ago at TED, I think \u2014
p9
aVI've come to this conclusion \u2014
p10
aVI think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.
p11
aVI think that I may have believed unconsciously,
p12
aVthen, that I was kind of a business hero.
p13
aVI had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;
p14
aVit was a magazine publishing company.
p15
aVIt had recently gone public
p16
aVand the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,
p17
aVa number I didn't really understand.
p18
aVA magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0
p19
aVwas fatter than a telephone directory,
p20
aVbusy pumping hot air into the bubble.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVAnd I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom
p23
aVthat was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.
p24
aVAnd all this had come from nothing.
p25
aVFifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at
p26
aVwhen I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."
p27
aVAnd 15 years later, there are 100 of them
p28
aVand 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.
p29
aVThe date was February 2000.
p30
aVI thought the little graph of my business life
p31
aVthat kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law \u2014
p32
aVever upward and to the right \u2014 it was going to go on forever.
p33
aVI mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe dotcom, ironically called Snowball,
p36
aVwas the very last consumer web company to go public
p37
aVthe next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.
p38
aVI watched everything that I'd built crumbling,
p39
aVand it looked like all this stuff was going to die
p40
aVand 15 years work would have come for nothing.
p41
aVAnd it was gut wrenching.
p42
aVIt took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,
p43
aVsomething which I was very proud of in the business.
p44
aVFebruary 2001 \u2014 in one day we laid off 350 people,
p45
aVand before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs
p46
aVfrom my companies. I felt sick.
p47
aVI watched my own net worth falling
p48
aVby about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.
p49
aVAnd worse than that, far worse than that,
p50
aVmy sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.
p51
aVI was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVAnd I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,
p54
aVis how the hell did I let my personal happiness
p55
aVget so tied up with this business thing?
p56
aa(lp57
VWell, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,
p58
aVbut I was, at that point, ready to move on.
p59
aVAnd to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.
p60
aVAnd the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,
p61
aVthat a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster \u2014
p62
aVemotional rollercoaster \u2014 in the last couple years.
p63
aVThis has been a big, big transition time,
p64
aVand I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us
p65
aVin taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.
p66
aVThe theme next year is re-birth.
p67
aa(lp68
VIt was at the same TED two years ago
p69
aVwhen Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.
p70
aVAnd at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,
p71
aVI started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:
p72
aVI started to read again.
p73
aVAnd I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,
p74
aVthere'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:
p75
aVcosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology
p76
aVto ... all this stuff had changed.
p77
aVAnd the way in which you could think about us as a species
p78
aVand us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.
p79
aVAnd what was really most exciting \u2014
p80
aVand I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did \u2014
p81
aVwas that all this stuff is connected.
p82
aVIt's connected; it all hooks into each other.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe talk about this a lot,
p85
aVand I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:
p86
aVMadame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,
p87
aVwas famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"
p88
aVAnd she answered, "A penis."
p89
aVAnd when you think about it, it's very true:
p90
aVwhat we all most desire is a penis \u2014
p91
aVor "happiness" as we say in English.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVAnd something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VBut something as basic as happiness,
p98
aVwhich 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion
p99
aVin the church or mosque or synagogue,
p100
aVtoday it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions
p101
aVthat you can ask about it, which are really interesting.
p102
aVYou can ask about what causes it biochemically:
p103
aVneuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.
p104
aVYou can ask what are the psychological causes of it:
p105
aVnature? Nurture? Current circumstance?
p106
aVTurns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.
p107
aVYou can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:
p108
aVdo you need to incorporate
p109
aVsome sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?
p110
aVYou can view it in sort of geopolitical terms
p111
aVand say, why is it that a billion people on this planet
p112
aVare so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,
p113
aVand whereas almost all the rest of them,
p114
aVregardless of how much money they have \u2014 whether it's two dollars a day or whatever \u2014
p115
aVare almost equally happy on average?
p116
aVOr you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:
p117
aVdid our genes invent this as a kind of trick
p118
aVto get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,
p119
aVto make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?
p120
aVAre we the victims of a mass delusion?
p121
aVAnd so on, and so on.
p122
aa(lp123
VTo understand even something as important to us as happiness,
p124
aVyou kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,
p125
aVand there's nowhere that I've discovered \u2014 other than TED \u2014
p126
aVwhere you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.
p127
aVAnd so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:
p128
aVto understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;
p129
aVa little bit about everything that surrounds it.
p130
aVAnd so, gradually over these three days,
p131
aVyou start off kind of trying to figure out,
p132
aV"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"
p133
aVAnd at the end of the four days,
p134
aVyour brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,
p135
aVand it's because all these different bits have been put together.
p136
aVIt's the total brain experience, we're going to ...
p137
aVit's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVEvery mental organ addressed. It really is.
p140
aa(lp141
VEnough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?
p142
aVSo, I will. Here's the vision for TED.
p143
aa(lp144
VNumber one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.
p145
aVJeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,
p146
aV"Chris, TED is a really great conference.
p147
aVYou're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVSo, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,
p150
aVand I will promise you right here and now
p151
aVthat the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.
p152
aVTruth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,
p153
aVno bandwagoning, no platforms.
p154
aVJust the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,
p155
aVacross all the disciplines that are represented here.
p156
aVThat's not going to be changed at all.
p157
aa(lp158
VNumber two: I am going to put together
p159
aVan incredible line up of speakers for next year.
p160
aVThe time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic
p161
aVafter coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.
p162
aVThere's a year to do this, and already \u2014
p163
aVI hope to show you a bit later \u2014
p164
aVthere's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.
p165
aVAnd I'm getting fantastic help from the community;
p166
aVthis is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts
p167
aVreach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.
p168
aVIt's true.
p169
aa(lp170
VNumber three: I do want to, if I can, find a way
p171
aVof extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.
p172
aVAnd one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.
p173
aVBooks kind of saved me in the last couple years,
p174
aVand that's a gift that I would like to pass on.
p175
aVSo, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package
p176
aVwith a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.
p177
aVThey may well be by a TED speaker,
p178
aVand so we can get the conversation going during the year
p179
aVand come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.
p180
aVI think it will be great.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,
p183
aVwhich is the new owner of TED.
p184
aVWhat Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED
p185
aVwill go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.
p186
aVAnd more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here
p187
aVare ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.
p188
aVAlready, just in the last few days,
p189
aVwe've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,
p190
aVthat they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,
p191
aVand the idea of getting this group of people together \u2014
p192
aVsome of the causes that we believe in,
p193
aVthe money that this conference can raise and the ideas \u2014
p194
aVI really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.
p195
aVI'm incredibly excited about that.
p196
aVIn fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.
p197
aVI'm in this for the long run,
p198
aVand I would be greatly honored and excited
p199
aVif you'll come on this journey with me.
