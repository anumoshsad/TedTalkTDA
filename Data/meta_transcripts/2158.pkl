VI'm a lexicographer.
p4
aVI make dictionaries.
p5
aVAnd my job as a lexicographer
p6
aVis to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary.
p7
aVMy job is not to decide what a word is; that is your job.
p8
aa(lp9
VEverybody who speaks English  decides together
p10
aVwhat's a word and what's not a word.
p11
aVEvery language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other.
p12
aVNow, sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad,
p13
aVthey don't really have a good reason.
p14
aVSo they say something like, "Because grammar!"
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVI don't actually really care about grammar too much \u2014 don't tell anybody.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut the word "grammar," actually, there are two kinds of grammar.
p19
aVThere's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain,
p20
aVand if you're a native  speaker of a language
p21
aVor a good speaker of a language,
p22
aVit's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language.
p23
aVAnd this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child.
p24
aVAnd here's an example:
p25
aVThis is a wug, right?
p26
aVIt's a wug.
p27
aVNow there is another one.
p28
aVThere are two of these.
p29
aVThere are two ...
p30
aVAudience: Wugs.
p31
aVErin McKean: Exactly! You know  how to make the plural of wug.
p32
aVThat rule lives in your brain.
p33
aVYou never had to be taught this rule,  you just understand it.
p34
aVThis is an experiment that was invented by a professor at [Boston University]
p35
aVnamed Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.
p36
aVSo we've been talking about this  for a long time.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain,
p39
aVthey're not like traffic laws, they're more like laws of nature.
p40
aVAnd nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature, right?
p41
aVWhen you leave the house in the morning,  your mom doesn't say,
p42
aV"Hey, honey, I think it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,
p43
aVdon't forget to obey the law of gravity."
p44
aVNobody says this.
p45
aVNow, there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature.
p46
aVSo you can think of a word as like a hat.
p47
aVOnce you know how hats work,
p48
aVnobody has to tell you,  "Don't wear hats on your feet."
p49
aVWhat they have to tell you is,  "Can you wear hats inside?
p50
aVWho gets to wear a hat?
p51
aVWhat are the kinds of hats you get to wear?"
p52
aVThose are more of the second kind  of grammar,
p53
aVwhich linguists often call usage,  as opposed to grammar.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, sometimes people use this kind of  rules-based grammar
p56
aVto discourage people from making up words.
p57
aVAnd I think that is, well, stupid.
p58
aVSo, for example,  people are always telling you,
p59
aV"Be creative, make new music, do art,  invent things, science and technology."
p60
aVBut when it comes to  words, they're like,
p61
aV"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here, whippersnappers. Give it a rest."
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVBut that makes no sense to me.
p64
aVWords are great. We should have more of them.
p65
aVI want you to make as many new words as possible.
p66
aVAnd I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe first way is the simplest way.
p69
aVBasically, steal them from other  languages.
p70
aV["Go rob other people"] (Laughter)
p71
aVLinguists call this borrowing,
p72
aVbut we never give the words back , so I'm just going to be honest
p73
aVand call it stealing.
p74
aVWe usually take words for things  that we like, like delicious food.
p75
aVWe took "kumquat" from Chinese, we took "caramel" from French.
p76
aVWe also take words  for cool things like "ninja," right?
p77
aVWe took that from Japanese,
p78
aVwhich is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VSo another way that you  can make words in English
p82
aVis by squishing two  other English words together.
p83
aVThis is called compounding.
p84
aVWords in English are like Lego:
p85
aVIf you use enough force,  you can put any two of them together.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVWe do this all the time in English:
p88
aVWords like "heartbroken," "bookworm,"  "sandcastle" all are compounds.
p89
aVSo go ahead and make words like "duckface," just don't make duckface.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VAnother way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding,
p93
aVbut instead you use so much force when you squish the words together
p94
aVthat some parts fall off.
p95
aVSo these are blend words,
p96
aVlike "brunch" is a blend  of "breakfast" and "lunch."
p97
aV"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."
p98
aVWho here knew that "motel"  was a blend word?
p99
aVYeah, that word is so old in English
p100
aVthat lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.
p101
aV"Edutainment" is a blend  of "education" and "entertainment."
p102
aVAnd of course, "electrocute" is a blend of "electric" and "execute."
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VYou can also make words by changing how they operate.
p106
aVThis is called functional shift.
p107
aVYou take a word that acts  as one part of speech,
p108
aVand you change it into another  part of speech.
p109
aVOkay, who here knew that "friend" hasn't always been a verb?
p110
aV"Friend" used to be noun  and then we verbed it.
p111
aVAlmost any word in English can be verbed.
p112
aVYou can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.
p113
aV"Commercial" used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun.
p114
aVAnd of course, you can "green" things.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnother way to make words in English is back-formation.
p117
aVYou can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit.
p118
aVSo for example, in English we had the word "editor" before we had the word "edit."
p119
aV"Edit" was formed from "editor."
p120
aVSometimes these back-formations  sound a little silly:
p121
aVBulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle  and burglers burgle.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VAnother way to make words in English
p125
aVis to take the first letters of something and squish them together.
p126
aVSo National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA.
p127
aVAnd of course you can do this  with anything, OMG!
p128
aa(lp129
VSo it doesn't matter how silly  the words are.
p130
aVThey can be really good words of English.
p131
aV"Absquatulate" is a perfectly  good word of English.
p132
aV"Mugwump" is a perfectly  good word of English.
p133
aVSo the words don't have have to sound  normal, they can sound really silly.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhy should you make words?
p136
aVYou should make words because every word
p137
aVis a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across.
p138
aVAnd new words grab people's attention.
p139
aVThey get people to focus on what  you're saying
p140
aVand that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across.
p141
aVA lot of people  on this stage today have said,
p142
aV"In the future, you can do this,
p143
aVyou can help with this, you can  help us explore, you can help us invent."
p144
aVYou can make a new word right now.
p145
aVEnglish has no age limit.
p146
aVGo ahead, start making words today,
p147
aVsend them to me, and I will put them  in my online dictionary, Wordnik.
p148
aVThank you so much.
