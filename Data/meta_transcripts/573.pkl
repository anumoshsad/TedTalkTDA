VI have had the distinct pleasure
p4
aVof living inside two biospheres.
p5
aVOf course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
p6
aVI've also lived in Biosphere 2.
p7
aVAnd the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.
p8
aVAnd hopefully from that I get to learn something.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo what did I learn? Well,
p11
aVhere I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.
p12
aVSo I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.
p13
aVAnd then of course I have to milk the goats
p14
aVand feed the goats in order to make the cheese.
p15
aVIt took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.
p16
aVHere in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,
p17
aVbecause I pick up the phone and I call and say,
p18
aV"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"
p19
aa(lp20
VSo Biosphere 2
p21
aVwas essentially a three-acre,
p22
aVentirely sealed, miniature world
p23
aVthat I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVOver the top it was sealed with steel and glass,
p26
aVunderneath it was sealed with a pan of steel \u2014
p27
aVessentially entirely sealed.
p28
aVSo we had our own miniature rainforest,
p29
aVa private beach with a coral reef.
p30
aVWe had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.
p31
aVWe had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.
p32
aVAnd of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.
p33
aa(lp34
VBack in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,
p35
aVwe had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.
p36
aVI mean, what is a biosphere?
p37
aVBack then, yes, I guess we all know now
p38
aVthat it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?
p39
aVWell, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
p40
aVAnd so we decided that what it really is
p41
aVis that it is entirely materially closed \u2014
p42
aVthat is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material \u2014
p43
aVand energetically open,
p44
aVwhich is essentially what planet Earth is.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2
p47
aVthat we called our Test Module.
p48
aVAnd the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,
p49
aVwalked in, to spend a couple of days in there
p50
aVwith all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there
p51
aVto hopefully keep him alive,
p52
aVthe doctors were incredibly concerned
p53
aVthat he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,
p54
aVor that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.
p55
aVBut of course none of that happened.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd over the ensuing few years,
p58
aVthere were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.
p59
aVBut by 1991
p60
aVwe finally had this thing built.
p61
aVAnd it was time for us to go in
p62
aVand give it a go.
p63
aVWe needed to know,
p64
aVis life this malleable?
p65
aVCan you take this biosphere,
p66
aVthat has evolved on a planetary scale,
p67
aVand jam it into a little bottle,
p68
aVand will it survive?
p69
aVBig questions.
p70
aVAnd we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else
p71
aVin the universe \u2014 if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,
p72
aVwould we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?
p73
aVWe also wanted to know so we can understand more about
p74
aVthe Earth that we all live in.
p75
aVWell, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in
p76
aVand try out this baby.
p77
aVLet's take it on a maiden voyage.
p78
aVWill it work? Or will something happen
p79
aVthat we can't understand and we can't fix,
p80
aVthereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
p81
aa(lp82
VSo eight of us went in: four men and four women.
p83
aVMore on that later.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd this is the world that we lived in.
p86
aVSo, on the top, we had
p87
aVthese beautiful rainforests and an ocean,
p88
aVand underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,
p89
aVwhich is where all the pumps and the valves
p90
aVand the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.
p91
aVOne of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden
p92
aVon top of an aircraft carrier."
p93
aVAnd then also we had the human habitat of course,
p94
aVwith the laboratories, and all of that.
p95
aVThis is the agriculture.
p96
aVIt was essentially an organic farm.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe day I walked into Biosphere 2,
p99
aVI was, for the first time,
p100
aVbreathing a completely different atmosphere
p101
aVthan everybody else in the world,
p102
aVexcept seven other people.
p103
aVAt that moment I became part of that biosphere.
p104
aVAnd I don't mean that in an abstract sense;
p105
aVI mean it rather literally.
p106
aVWhen I breathed out, my CO2
p107
aVfed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.
p108
aVAnd we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVAnd those sweet potatoes
p111
aVbecame part of me.
p112
aVIn fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes
p113
aVI became orange with sweet potato.
p114
aVI literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.
p115
aVI was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhen it came to our atmosphere, however,
p118
aVit wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,
p119
aVbecause it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.
p120
aVAnd we knew that we were losing CO2.
p121
aVAnd so we were working to sequester carbon.
p122
aVGood lord \u2014 we know that term now.
p123
aVWe were growing plants like crazy.
p124
aVWe were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,
p125
aVgrowing plants, going around, around, around,
p126
aVtrying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.
p127
aVWe were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.
p128
aVWe stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.
p129
aVWe stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.
p130
aVBut our oxygen was going down faster
p131
aVthan our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,
p132
aVbecause we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.
p133
aVAnd it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.
p134
aVWe had lost seven tons of oxygen.
p135
aVAnd we had no clue where it was.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen \u2014
p138
aVand our oxygen went down quite far;
p139
aVit went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent \u2014
p140
aVmy goodness, do you feel dreadful.
p141
aVI mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.
p142
aVAnd we had sleep apnea at night.
p143
aVSo you'd wake up gasping with breath,
p144
aVbecause your blood chemistry has changed.
p145
aVAnd that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you \u2014 (Gasps) \u2014
p146
aVtake a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.
p147
aVAnd everybody outside thought we were dying.
p148
aVI mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.
p149
aVAnd I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.
p150
aVWe're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
p151
aVAnd the doctor was, in fact, checking us
p152
aVto make sure we were, in fact, fine.
p153
aVBut in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.
p154
aVAnd one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.
p155
aVAnd it was time for us to put oxygen in.
p156
aVAnd you might think, well,
p157
aV"Boy, your life support system
p158
aVwas failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"
p159
aVYes. In a sense it was terrifying.
p160
aVExcept that I knew I could walk out the airlock door
p161
aVat any time, if it really got bad,
p162
aVthough who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?
p163
aVNot me, that was for sure.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,
p166
aVbecause we could really crank this baby up,
p167
aVas a scientific tool,
p168
aVand see if we could, in fact, find
p169
aVwhere those seven tons of oxygen had gone.
p170
aVAnd we did indeed find it.
p171
aVAnd we found it in the concrete.
p172
aVEssentially it had done something very simple.
p173
aVWe had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.
p174
aVIt broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;
p175
aVit put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.
p176
aVPretty straightforward really.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo at the end of the two years
p179
aVwhen we came out, we were elated,
p180
aVbecause, in fact, although you might say
p181
aVwe had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"
p182
aVwhen your oxygen is going down,
p183
aVstopped working, essentially, in your life support system,
p184
aVthat's a very bad failure.
p185
aVExcept that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.
p186
aVAnd nothing else emerged
p187
aVthat really was as serious as that.
p188
aVAnd we proved the concept, more or less.
p189
aVPeople, on the other hand, was a different subject.
p190
aVWe were \u2014 yeah I don't know that we were fixable.
p191
aVWe all went quite nuts, I will say.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd the day I came out of Biosphere 2,
p194
aVI was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.
p195
aVFor two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.
p196
aVAnd everybody ran up to me.
p197
aVAnd I recoiled. They stank!
p198
aVPeople stink!
p199
aVWe stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,
p200
aVand all kinds of stuff.
p201
aVNow we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,
p202
aVbut nothing with perfume.
p203
aVAnd boy do we stink out here.
p204
aVNot only that,
p205
aVbut I lost touch of where my food came from.
p206
aVI had been growing all my own food.
p207
aVI had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.
p208
aVI didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.
p209
aVIn fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,
p210
aVreading all the names on all of the things.
p211
aVPeople must have thought I was nuts.
p212
aVIt was really quite astonishing.
p213
aVAnd I slowly lost track
p214
aVof where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.
p215
aVIn Biosphere 2 I totally understood
p216
aVthat I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,
p217
aVand it had an impact on me,
p218
aVvery viscerally, very literally.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo I went about my business:
p221
aVParagon Space Development Corporation,
p222
aVa little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,
p223
aVbecause I had nothing else to do.
p224
aVAnd one of the things we did was
p225
aVtry to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,
p226
aVand what can you do with them?
p227
aVAnd so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.
p228
aVWe had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,
p229
aVfor 16 months, where we managed to produce
p230
aVthe first organisms to go through
p231
aVcomplete multiple life cycles in space \u2014
p232
aVreally pushing the envelope
p233
aVof understanding how malleable
p234
aVour life systems are.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd I'm also proud to announce
p237
aVthat you're getting a sneak preview \u2014 on Friday we're going to announce
p238
aVthat we're actually forming a team
p239
aVto develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,
p240
aVwhich is going to be pretty fun.
p241
aVAnd the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:
p242
aVan entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.
p243
aVAnd part of that is that we had to model
p244
aVvery rapid circulation of CO2
p245
aVand oxygen and water through this plant system.
p246
aa(lp247
VAs a result of that modeling
p248
aVI ended up in all places,
p249
aVin Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.
p250
aVEritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,
p251
aVis one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,
p252
aVincredibly stark, and I have no understanding
p253
aVof how people eke out a living there.
p254
aVIt is so dry.
p255
aVThis is what I saw.
p256
aVBut this is also what I saw.
p257
aVI saw a company that had
p258
aVtaken seawater
p259
aVand sand, and they were growing
p260
aVa kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.
p261
aVAnd it will produce a food crop.
p262
aVIn this case it was oilseed.
p263
aVIt was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves
p264
aVin a plantation.
p265
aVAnd the mangroves were providing wood
p266
aVand honey and leaves for the animals,
p267
aVso that they could produce milk and whatnot,
p268
aVlike we had in the Biosphere.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.
p271
aVShrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,
p272
aVfrankly, from an environmental point of view.
p273
aVThey pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.
p274
aVThey also pollute their next-door neighbors.
p275
aVSo they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.
p276
aVAnd what this project was doing
p277
aVwas taking the effluent of these,
p278
aVand turning them into all of this food.
p279
aVThey were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.
p280
aVThey had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.
p281
aa(lp282
VI was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion
p283
aVfor a carbon credit program, under the U.N.
p284
aVKyoto Protocol system.
p285
aVAnd as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,
p286
aVI was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"
p287
aVWhen I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,
p288
aVI know where to draw the boundary.
p289
aVIn a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.
p290
aVWell, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.
p291
aVAnd understand its interactions with the entire Earth.
p292
aVAnd put your project in that context.
p293
aa(lp294
VAround the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,
p295
aVfrom what I would call a biocidal species,
p296
aVone that \u2014 whether we intentionally or unintentionally \u2014
p297
aVhave designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.
p298
aVThis is in fact, this beautiful photograph,
p299
aVis in fact over the Amazon.
p300
aVAnd here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.
p301
aVAnd those beautiful wispy clouds
p302
aVare, in fact, fires, human-made fires.
p303
aVWe're in the process of transforming from this,
p304
aVto what I would call a biophilic society,
p305
aVone where we learn to nurture society.
p306
aVNow it may not seem like it, but we are.
p307
aVIt is happening all across the world,
p308
aVin every kind of walk of life,
p309
aVand every kind of career
p310
aVand industry that you can think of.
p311
aVAnd I think often times people get lost in that.
p312
aVThey go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?
p313
aVIt's such a huge subject."
p314
aVAnd I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.
p315
aa(lp316
VThis is the story of a rake in my backyard.
p317
aVThis was my backyard,
p318
aVvery early on, when I bought my property.
p319
aVAnd in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.
p320
aVAnd they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.
p321
aVAnd on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,
p322
aVand I want to throttle them.
p323
aVIt's a certain type of aesthetic.
p324
aVWe're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
p325
aVAnd I threw away my rake.
p326
aVAnd I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.
p327
aVAnd over time, essentially what have I been doing?
p328
aVI've been building topsoil.
p329
aVAnd so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.
p330
aVAnd I have an oasis.
p331
aVThis is what happens every spring. For six weeks,
p332
aVsix to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.
p333
aVThis is actually in a riparian area.
p334
aVAnd all of Tucson could be like this
p335
aVif everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.
p336
aVThe small stuff counts.
p337
aa(lp338
VThe Industrial Revolution \u2014 and Prometheus \u2014
p339
aVhas given us this, the ability to light up the world.
p340
aVIt has also given us this,
p341
aVthe ability to look at the world from the outside.
p342
aVNow we may not all have
p343
aVanother biosphere that we can run to,
p344
aVand compare it to this biosphere.
p345
aVBut we can look at the world,
p346
aVand try to understand where we are in its context,
p347
aVand how we choose to interact with it.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd if you lose where you are in your biosphere,
p350
aVor are perhaps having a difficulty connecting
p351
aVwith where you are in the biosphere,
p352
aVI would say to you,
p353
aVtake a deep breath.
p354
aVThe yogis had it right.
p355
aVBreath does, in fact, connect us all
p356
aVin a very literal way.
p357
aVTake a breath now.
p358
aVAnd as you breathe, think
p359
aVabout what is in your breath.
p360
aVThere perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.
p361
aVMaybe there is a little bit of oxygen
p362
aVfrom some algae on the beach not far from here.
p363
aVIt also connects us in time.
p364
aVThere may be some carbon in your breath
p365
aVfrom the dinosaurs.
p366
aVThere could also be carbon that you are exhaling now
p367
aVthat will be in the breath
p368
aVof your great-great-great-grandchildren.
p369
aVThank you. (Applause)
