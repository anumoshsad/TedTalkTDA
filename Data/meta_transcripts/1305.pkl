VI'm actually going to share something with you
p4
aVI haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years.
p5
aVSo bear with me as I take you through this journey.
p6
aVWhen I was 22 years old,
p7
aVI came home from work, put a leash on my dog
p8
aVand went for my usual run.
p9
aVI had no idea that at that moment,
p10
aVmy life was going to change forever.
p11
aVWhile I was preparing my dog for the run,
p12
aVa man was finishing drinking at a bar,
p13
aVpicked up his car keys, got into a car
p14
aVand headed south,
p15
aVor wherever he was.
p16
aVI was running across the street,
p17
aVand the only thing that I actually remember
p18
aVis feeling like a grenade went off in my head.
p19
aVAnd I remember putting my hands on the ground
p20
aVand feeling my life's blood
p21
aVemptying out of my neck and my mouth.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat had happened is, he ran a red light
p24
aVand hit me and my dog.
p25
aVShe ended up underneath the car.
p26
aVI flew out in front of the car,
p27
aVand then he ran over my legs.
p28
aVMy left leg got caught up in the wheel well \u2014
p29
aVspun it around.
p30
aVThe bumper of the car hit my throat,
p31
aVslicing it open.
p32
aVI ended up with blunt chest trauma.
p33
aVYour aorta comes up behind your heart, it's your major artery \u2014
p34
aVand it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
p35
aVIt foamed, and ... horrible things were happening to me.
p36
aVI had no idea what was going on,
p37
aVbut strangers intervened,
p38
aVkept my heart moving, beating.
p39
aVI say "moving," because it was quivering,
p40
aVand they were trying to put a beat back into it.
p41
aa(lp42
VSomebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck
p43
aVto open up my airway, so I could get some air in there.
p44
aVAnd my lung collapsed,
p45
aVso somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well,
p46
aVto stop that catastrophic event from happening.
p47
aVSomehow I ended up at the hospital.
p48
aVI was wrapped in ice,
p49
aVand then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.
p50
aa(lp51
VEighteen months later, I woke up.
p52
aVI was blind, I couldn't speak
p53
aVand I couldn't walk.
p54
aVI was 64 pounds.
p55
aVThe hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.
p56
aVAnd in fact, they started to call me a "gomer."
p57
aVThat's another story we won't even get into.
p58
aVI had so many surgeries to put my neck back together,
p59
aVto repair my heart a few times.
p60
aa(lp61
VSome things worked, some things didn't.
p62
aVI had lots of titanium put in me;
p63
aVcadaver bones,
p64
aVto try to get my feet moving the right way.
p65
aVAnd I ended up with a plastic nose,
p66
aVporcelain teeth and all kinds of other things.
p67
aVBut eventually, I started to look human again.
p68
aVBut ...
p69
aVIt's hard sometimes to talk about these things,
p70
aVso bear with me.
p71
aVI had more than 50 surgeries.
p72
aVBut who's counting?
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go.
p77
aVThey needed to open up space for somebody else
p78
aVthat they thought could come back
p79
aVfrom whatever they were going through.
p80
aVEverybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
p81
aVSo they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart,
p82
aVand it landed at a senior home, here in Colorado.
p83
aVAnd I know all of you are scratching your head:
p84
aV"A senior citizens' home?
p85
aVWhat in the world are you going to do there?"
p86
aVBut if you think about all of the skills and talent
p87
aVthat are in this room right now,
p88
aVthat's what a senior home has.
p89
aVSo there were all these skills and talents
p90
aVthat these seniors had.
p91
aVThe one advantage they had over most of you
p92
aVis wisdom,
p93
aVbecause they had a long life.
p94
aVAnd I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut imagine what it was like for them
p97
aVwhen I showed up at their doorstep.
p98
aVAt that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.
p99
aVI was bald.
p100
aVI was wearing hospital scrubs.
p101
aVAnd somebody donated tennis shoes for me.
p102
aVAnd I had a white cane in one hand
p103
aVand a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.
p104
aVSo the senior citizens realized
p105
aVthat they needed to have an emergency meeting.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VSo they pulled back and they were looking at each other,
p110
aVand they were going, "OK, what skills do we have in this room?
p111
aVThis kid needs a lot of work."
p112
aa(lp113
VSo they eventually started matching their talents and skills
p114
aVto all of my needs.
p115
aVBut one of the first things they needed to do
p116
aVwas assess what I needed right away.
p117
aVI needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being,
p118
aVsince I'd been eating through a tube in my chest
p119
aVand through my veins.
p120
aVSo I had to go through trying to eat again.
p121
aVAnd they went through that process.
p122
aVAnd then they had to figure out:
p123
aV"Well, she needs furniture.
p124
aVShe is sleeping in the corner of this apartment."
p125
aVSo they went to their storage lockers
p126
aVand all gathered their extra furniture \u2014
p127
aVgave me pots and pans, blankets \u2014
p128
aVeverything.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd then the next thing that I needed
p131
aVwas a makeover.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VSo out went the green scrubs,
p136
aVand in came the polyester and floral prints.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VWe're not going to talk about the hairstyles
p141
aVthey tried to force on me once my hair grew back.
p142
aVBut I did say no to the blue hair.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo eventually, what went on is,
p147
aVthey decided that, well, I need to learn to speak.
p148
aVYou can't be an independent person
p149
aVif you're not able to speak and you can't see.
p150
aVSo they figured not being able to see is one thing,
p151
aVbut they need to get me to talk.
p152
aVSo while Sally, the office manager,
p153
aVwas teaching me to speak in the day \u2014
p154
aVit's hard, because when you're a kid, you take things for granted.
p155
aVYou learn things unconsciously.
p156
aVBut for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing,
p157
aVand I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue
p158
aVand my new teeth and my lips,
p159
aVand capture the air and get the word out.
p160
aVSo, I acted like a two-year-old,
p161
aVand refused to work.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut the men had a better idea.
p164
aVThey were going to make it fun for me.
p165
aVSo they were teaching me cuss-word Scrabble at night.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd then, secretly, how to swear like a sailor.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VI'm going to just leave it to your imagination
p174
aVas to what my first words were \u2014
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
Vwhen Sally finally got my confidence built.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VSo I moved on from there.
p183
aVAnd a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's
p184
aVtook on the task of teaching me to write.
p185
aVThe redundancy was actually good for me.
p186
aVSo, we'll just keep moving on.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VOne of the pivotal times for me
p191
aVwas actually learning to cross the street again
p192
aVas a blind person.
p193
aVSo close your eyes.
p194
aVNow imagine you have to cross a street.
p195
aVYou don't know how far that street is,
p196
aVand you don't know if you're going straight.
p197
aVAnd you hear cars whizzing back and forth,
p198
aVand you had a horrible accident
p199
aVthat landed you in this situation.
p200
aVSo there were two obstacles I had to get through.
p201
aVOne was post-traumatic stress disorder.
p202
aVEvery time I approached the corner or the curb,
p203
aVI would panic.
p204
aVAnd the second one
p205
aVwas actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo one of the seniors just came up to me,
p208
aVand she pushed me up to the corner and said,
p209
aV"When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
p210
aVIf it's hit, don't cross the street."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VMade perfect sense.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VBut by the third cane that went whizzing across the road \u2014
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
Vthey realized that they needed to put their resources together,
p223
aVand they raised funds
p224
aVso that I could go to the Braille Institute
p225
aVand actually gain the skills to be a blind person,
p226
aVand also to go get a guide dog,
p227
aVwho transformed my life.
p228
aVAnd I was able to return to college
p229
aVbecause of the senior citizens who invested in me,
p230
aVand also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.
p231
aa(lp232
VTen years later, I gained my sight back.
p233
aVNot magically \u2014
p234
aVI opted in for three surgeries,
p235
aVand one of them was experimental.
p236
aVIt was actually robotic surgery
p237
aVthat removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe biggest change for me was that the world moved forward,
p240
aVthat there were innovations and all kinds of new things \u2014
p241
aVcellphones, laptops,
p242
aVall these things that I had never seen before.
p243
aVAnd as a blind person,
p244
aVyour visual memory fades,
p245
aVand is replaced with how you feel about things
p246
aVand how things sound
p247
aVand how things smell.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo one day, I was in my room
p250
aVand I saw this thing sitting in my room.
p251
aVI thought it was a monster,
p252
aVso I was walking around it.
p253
aVAnd I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
p254
aVAnd I touched it and I went,
p255
aV"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VEverything is different when you're a sighted person,
p260
aVbecause you take that for granted.
p261
aVBut when you're blind, you have the tactile memory for things.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe biggest change for me was looking down at my hands
p264
aVand seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life.
p265
aVI thought that time had stood still for some reason
p266
aVand moved on for family and friends.
p267
aVBut when I looked down,
p268
aVI realized that time marched on for me, too,
p269
aVand that I needed to get caught up.
p270
aVSo I got going on it.
p271
aa(lp272
VWe didn't have words like "crowdsourcing" and "radical collaboration"
p273
aVwhen I had my accident.
p274
aVBut the concept held true \u2014
p275
aVpeople working with people to rebuild me;
p276
aVpeople working with people to reeducate me.
p277
aVI wouldn't be standing here today
p278
aVif it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.
p279
aa(lp280
VThank you so much.
