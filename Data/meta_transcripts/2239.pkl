VTo be honest, by personality,
p4
aVI'm just not much of a crier.
p5
aVBut I think in my career that's been a good thing.
p6
aVI'm a civil rights lawyer,
p7
aVand I've seen some  horrible things in the world.
p8
aVI began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States.
p9
aVAnd then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda
p10
aVto be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation.
p11
aVIt turns out that tears  just aren't much help
p12
aVwhen you're trying  to investigate a genocide.
p13
aVThe things I had to see,  and feel and touch
p14
aVwere pretty unspeakable.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhat I can tell you is this:
p17
aVthat the Rwandan genocide
p18
aVwas one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion.
p19
aVThat word, compassion, actually  comes from two Latin words:
p20
aVcum passio, which simply mean  "to suffer with."
p21
aVAnd the things that I saw and experienced
p22
aVin Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering,
p23
aVit did, in moments, move me to tears.
p24
aVBut I just wish that I,  and the rest of the world,
p25
aVhad been moved earlier.
p26
aVAnd not just to tears,
p27
aVbut to actually stop the genocide.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow by contrast, I've also been involved
p30
aVwith one of the world's greatest successes of compassion.
p31
aVAnd that's the fight against  global poverty.
p32
aVIt's a cause that probably has involved all of us here.
p33
aVI don't know if your first introduction
p34
aVmight have been choruses of "We Are the World,"
p35
aVor maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door,
p36
aVor maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water.
p37
aVI don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was
p38
aVbut I do remember the most jarring.
p39
aa(lp40
VIt was when I met Venus \u2014
p41
aVshe's a mom from Zambia.
p42
aVShe's got three kids and she's a widow.
p43
aVWhen I met her, she had walked about 12 miles
p44
aVin the only garments she owned,
p45
aVto come to the capital city and to share her story.
p46
aVShe sat down with me for hours,
p47
aVjust ushered me in to  the world of poverty.
p48
aVShe described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire
p49
aVfinally just went completely cold.
p50
aVWhen that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out.
p51
aVWhen the last of the food,  despite her best efforts,
p52
aVran out.
p53
aVShe had to watch her youngest son, Peter,
p54
aVsuffer from malnutrition,
p55
aVas his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness.
p56
aVAs his eyes grew cloudy and dim.
p57
aVAnd then as Peter finally grew cold.
p58
aa(lp59
VFor over 50 years, stories like this have been moving us to compassion.
p60
aVWe whose kids have plenty to eat.
p61
aVAnd we're moved not only  to care about global poverty,
p62
aVbut to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering.
p63
aVNow there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough,
p64
aVand what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough,
p65
aVbut the truth is this:
p66
aVThe fight against global poverty is probably the broadest,
p67
aVlongest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion
p68
aVin the history of our species.
p69
aVAnd so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight
p70
aVthat might forever change the way you think about that struggle.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut first, let me begin with what you probably already know.
p73
aVThirty-five years ago, when I would have been graduating from high school,
p74
aVthey told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty.
p75
aVThat number, today, is now  down to 17,000.
p76
aVWay too many, of course,
p77
aVbut it does mean that every year,
p78
aVthere's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty.
p79
aVMoreover, the number of  people in our world
p80
aVwho are living in extreme poverty,
p81
aVwhich is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day,
p82
aVthat has fallen from 50 percent,
p83
aVto only 15 percent.
p84
aVThis is massive progress,
p85
aVand this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible.
p86
aVAnd I think you and I,
p87
aVI think, honestly, that we can  feel proud and encouraged
p88
aVto see the way that compassion  actually has the power
p89
aVto succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut here's the part that you  might not hear very much about.
p92
aVIf you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day,
p93
aVit turns out that virtually  the same two billion people
p94
aVwho were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school,
p95
aVare still stuck there,
p96
aV35 years later.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo why, why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty?
p99
aVWell, let's think about Venus for a moment.
p100
aVNow for decades, my wife and I have been moved by common compassion
p101
aVto sponsor kids, to fund microloans,
p102
aVto support generous levels of foreign aid.
p103
aVBut until I had actually talked to Venus,
p104
aVI would have had no idea that  none of those approaches
p105
aVactually addressed why she had to watch her son die.
p106
aV"We were doing fine," Venus told me,
p107
aV"until Brutus started to cause trouble."
p108
aVNow, Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and "cause trouble"
p109
aVis what happened the day after Venus' husband died,
p110
aVwhen Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house,
p111
aVstole all their land, and robbed their market stall.
p112
aVYou see, Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd then it occurred to me, of course,
p115
aVthat none of my child sponsorships, none of the microloans,
p116
aVnone of the traditional  anti-poverty programs
p117
aVwere going to stop Brutus,
p118
aVbecause they weren't meant to.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis became even more clear to me when I met Griselda.
p121
aVShe's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community
p122
aVin Guatemala.
p123
aVAnd one of the things we've learned over the years
p124
aVis that perhaps the most powerful thing
p125
aVthat Griselda and her family can do
p126
aVto get Griselda and her family  out of poverty
p127
aVis to make sure that she goes to school.
p128
aVThe experts call this the Girl Effect.
p129
aVBut when we met Griselda,  she wasn't going to school.
p130
aVIn fact, she was rarely ever  leaving her home.
p131
aa(lp132
VDays before we met her,
p133
aVwhile she was walking home from church with her family,
p134
aVin broad daylight,
p135
aVmen from her community  just snatched her off the street,
p136
aVand violently raped her.
p137
aVSee, Griselda had every opportunity to go to school,
p138
aVit just wasn't safe for her to get there.
p139
aVAnd Griselda's not the only one.
p140
aVAround the world, poor women and girls
p141
aVbetween the ages of 15 and 44,
p142
aVthey are \u2014 when victims of  the everyday violence
p143
aVof domestic abuse and sexual violence \u2014
p144
aVthose two forms of violence account for more death and disability
p145
aVthan malaria, than car accidents, than war combined.
p146
aVThe truth is, the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence.
p147
aa(lp148
VIn South Asia, for instance, I could drive past this rice mill
p149
aVand see this man hoisting  these 100-pound sacks
p150
aVof rice upon his thin back.
p151
aVBut I would have no idea, until later,
p152
aVthat he was actually a slave,
p153
aVheld by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school.
p154
aVDecades of anti-poverty programs right in his community
p155
aVwere never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves
p156
aVfrom the beatings and the rapes and the torture
p157
aVof violence inside the rice mill.
p158
aVIn fact, half a century of  anti-poverty programs
p159
aVhave left more poor people in slavery
p160
aVthan in any other time in human history.
p161
aa(lp162
VExperts tell us that there's about 35 million people in slavery today.
p163
aVThat's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada,
p164
aVwhere we're sitting today.
p165
aVThis is why, over time, I have come to call this epidemic of violence
p166
aVthe Locust Effect.
p167
aVBecause in the lives of the poor, it just descends like a plague
p168
aVand it destroys everything.
p169
aVIn fact, now when you survey very, very poor communities,
p170
aVresidents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence.
p171
aVBut notice the violence that they fear
p172
aVis not the violence of  genocide or the wars,
p173
aVit's everyday violence.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think,
p176
aVwell, of course we've got to change all the laws.
p177
aVWe've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.
p178
aVBut then I found out, it already is.
p179
aVThe problem is not that  the poor don't get laws,
p180
aVit's that they don't get law enforcement.
p181
aVIn the developing world,
p182
aVbasic law enforcement systems are so broken
p183
aVthat recently the U.N. issued  a report that found
p184
aVthat "most poor people live outside the protection of the law."
p185
aVNow honestly, you and I have  just about no idea
p186
aVof what that would mean
p187
aVbecause we have no  first-hand experience of it.
p188
aVFunctioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption.
p189
aVIn fact, nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers:
p190
aV9-1-1,
p191
aVwhich, of course, is the number for the emergency police operator
p192
aVhere in Canada and in the United States,
p193
aVwhere the average response time  to a police 911 emergency call
p194
aVis about 10 minutes.
p195
aVSo we take this just  completely for granted.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you?
p198
aVA woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like.
p199
aVShe was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night,
p200
aVwhen a man started to tear  his way into her home.
p201
aVThis was her worst nightmare,
p202
aVbecause this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault
p203
aVjust two weeks before.
p204
aVSo terrified, she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do:
p205
aVShe calls 911 \u2014
p206
aVbut only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county,
p207
aVlaw enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends.
p208
aVListen.
p209
aVDispatcher: I don't have anybody  to send out there.
p210
aVWoman: OK
p211
aVDispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you,
p212
aVcan you ask him to go away?
p213
aVOr do you know if he is intoxicated or anything?
p214
aVWoman: I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you.
p215
aVHe's broken in before, busted down my door, assaulted me.
p216
aVDispatcher: Uh-huh.
p217
aVWoman: Um, yeah, so ...
p218
aVDispatcher: Is there any way you could safely leave the residence?
p219
aVWoman: No, I can't, because he's blocking pretty much my only way out.
p220
aVDispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do  is give you some advice,
p221
aVand call the sheriff's office tomorrow.
p222
aVObviously, if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon
p223
aVor is trying to cause you physical harm, that's a different story.
p224
aVYou know, the sheriff's office doesn't work up there.
p225
aVI don't have anybody to send."
p226
aa(lp227
VGary Haugen: Tragically, the woman  inside that house
p228
aVwas violently assaulted, choked and raped
p229
aVbecause this is what it means to live outside the rule of law.
p230
aVAnd this is where billions of our poorest live.
p231
aVWhat does that look like?
p232
aVIn Bolivia, for example, if a man  sexually assaults a poor child,
p233
aVstatistically, he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying
p234
aVthan he is of ever going  to jail for that crime.
p235
aVIn South Asia, if you  enslave a poor person,
p236
aVyou're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning
p237
aVthan ever being sent  to jail for that crime.
p238
aVAnd so the epidemic of everyday  violence, it just rages on.
p239
aVAnd it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people
p240
aVout of their two-dollar-a-day hell.
p241
aVBecause the data just doesn't lie.
p242
aVIt turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services
p243
aVto the poor,
p244
aVbut if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies
p245
aVfrom taking it all away,
p246
aVyou're going to be very disappointed in the long-term impact of your efforts.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement
p249
aVin the developing world would be a huge priority
p250
aVfor the global fight against poverty.
p251
aVBut it's not.
p252
aVAuditors of international assistance recently couldn't find
p253
aVeven one percent of aid going  to protect the poor
p254
aVfrom the lawless chaos  of everyday violence.
p255
aVAnd honestly, when we do talk about  violence against the poor,
p256
aVsometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.
p257
aVA fresh water organization tells a heart-wrenching story
p258
aVof girls who are raped on the way to fetching water,
p259
aVand then celebrates the solution of a new well
p260
aVthat drastically shortens their walk.
p261
aVEnd of story.
p262
aVBut not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community.
p263
aVIf a young woman on one  of our college campuses
p264
aVwas raped on her walk to the library,
p265
aVwe would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm.
p266
aVAnd yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow the truth is, the traditional experts
p269
aVin economic development and poverty alleviation,
p270
aVthey don't know how to fix this problem.
p271
aVAnd so what happens?
p272
aVThey don't talk about it.
p273
aVBut the more fundamental reason
p274
aVthat law enforcement for the poor in the developing world
p275
aVis so neglected,
p276
aVis because the people inside the developing world, with money,
p277
aVdon't need it.
p278
aVI was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago
p279
aVtalking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world
p280
aVand I was just asking them,
p281
aV"How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence?"
p282
aVAnd they looked at each other,  and they said, practically in unison,
p283
aV"We buy it."
p284
aa(lp285
VIndeed, private security forces  in the developing world
p286
aVare now, four, five and seven times larger than the public police force.
p287
aVIn Africa, the largest employer  on the continent now is private security.
p288
aVBut see, the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer,
p289
aVbut the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected
p290
aVand they keep getting thrown to the ground.
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is a massive and scandalous outrage.
p293
aVAnd it doesn't have to be this way.
p294
aVBroken law enforcement can be fixed.
p295
aVViolence can be stopped.
p296
aVAlmost all criminal justice systems,
p297
aVthey start out broken and corrupt,
p298
aVbut they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe path forward is really pretty clear.
p301
aVNumber one: We have to start making
p302
aVstopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty.
p303
aVIn fact, any conversation about global poverty
p304
aVthat doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd secondly, we have to begin  to seriously invest resources
p307
aVand share expertise to support  the developing world
p308
aVas they fashion new,  public systems of justice,
p309
aVnot private security,
p310
aVthat give everybody a chance to be safe.
p311
aVThese transformations  are actually possible
p312
aVand they're happening today.
p313
aVRecently, the Gates Foundation  funded a project
p314
aVin the second largest city  of the Philippines,
p315
aVwhere local advocates and local law enforcement
p316
aVwere able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically,
p317
aVthat in just four short years,
p318
aVthey were able to measurably reduce
p319
aVthe commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by 79 percent.
p320
aa(lp321
VYou know, from the hindsight of history,
p322
aVwhat's always most inexplicable and inexcusable
p323
aVare the simple failures of compassion.
p324
aVBecause I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren
p325
aVand they just ask us,
p326
aV"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?
p327
aVWhere were you, Grandpa, when  the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany
p328
aVand were being rejected from our shores?
p329
aVWhere were you?
p330
aVAnd Grandma, where were you when they were marching
p331
aVour Japanese-American neighbors off to internment camps?
p332
aVAnd Grandpa, where were you  when they were beating
p333
aVour African-American neighbors
p334
aVjust because they were trying to register to vote?"
p335
aVLikewise, when our grandchildren ask us,
p336
aV"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you
p337
aVwhen two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos
p338
aVof everyday violence?"
p339
aVI hope we can say that we had compassion, that we raised our voice,
p340
aVand as a generation, we were moved to make the violence stop.
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you very much.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VChris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.
p347
aVTalk to us a bit about some of the things
p348
aVthat have actually been happening to, for example, boost police training.
p349
aVHow hard a process is that?
p350
aVGH: Well, one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now
p351
aVis that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious.
p352
aVThere's actually, now,  political will to do that.
p353
aVBut it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise.
p354
aVThere's a political will struggle  that's going to take place as well,
p355
aVbut those are winnable fights,
p356
aVbecause we've done some examples around the world
p357
aVat International Justice Mission that are very encouraging.
p358
aa(lp359
VCA: So just tell us in one country, how much it costs
p360
aVto make a material difference  to police, for example \u2014
p361
aVI know that's only one piece of it.
p362
aVGH: In Guatemala, for instance, we've started a project there
p363
aVwith the local police  and court system, prosecutors,
p364
aVto retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases.
p365
aVAnd we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence
p366
aVincrease by more than 1,000 percent.
p367
aVThis project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year,
p368
aVand the kind of bang  you can get for your buck
p369
aVin terms of leveraging a criminal justice system
p370
aVthat could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led,
p371
aVand these countries,  especially a middle class
p372
aVthat is seeing that there's  really no future
p373
aVwith this total instability and total privatization of security
p374
aVI think there's an opportunity, a window for change.
p375
aa(lp376
VCA: But to make this happen, you have to look at each part in the chain \u2014
p377
aVthe police, who else?
p378
aVGH: So that's the thing  about law enforcement,
p379
aVit starts out with the police,
p380
aVthey're the front end of the pipeline of justice,
p381
aVbut they hand if off to the prosecutors,
p382
aVand the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts,
p383
aVand the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services
p384
aVall the way through that.
p385
aVSo you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together.
p386
aVIn the past, there's been a little bit of training of the courts,
p387
aVbut they get crappy evidence  from the police,
p388
aVor a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism
p389
aVbut nothing to do with treating the common poor person
p390
aVwith excellent law enforcement,
p391
aVso it's about pulling that all together,
p392
aVand you can actually have people in very poor communities
p393
aVexperience law enforcement like us,
p394
aVwhich is imperfect in our  own experience, for sure,
p395
aVbut boy, is it a great thing to sense that you can call 911
p396
aVand maybe someone will protect you.
p397
aa(lp398
