VThe maxim, "Know thyself" has been around since the ancient Greeks.
p4
aVSome attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.
p5
aVBut the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first,
p6
aVbecause it's still sage advice, even today.
p7
aV"Know thyself."
p8
aVIt's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless,
p9
aVbut it rings familiar and true, doesn't it?
p10
aV"Know thyself."
p11
aVI understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems,
p12
aVor more exactly, the confusions, of consciousness.
p13
aVI've always been fascinated with knowing the self.
p14
aVThis fascination led me to submerge myself in art,
p15
aVstudy neuroscience, and later, to become a psychotherapist.
p16
aa(lp17
VToday I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon,
p18
aVa thought-controlled computing company.
p19
aVMy goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves.
p20
aVI take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself."
p21
aVIf you think about it,
p22
aVthis imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it?
p23
aVI mean, it's self-awareness
p24
aVthat separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.
p25
aa(lp26
VToday we're often too busy
p27
aVtending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves.
p28
aVUnder the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations,
p29
aVe-mails, relentless exchange of media channels
p30
aVand passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags,
p31
aVwe lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place:
p32
aVOurselves.
p33
aVMuch of the time we're transfixed
p34
aVby all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world.
p35
aVAnd we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.
p36
aVWe've cluttered ourselves up with all this.
p37
aVAnd we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat,
p38
aVleaving it all behind.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo we go far away to the top of a mountain,
p41
aVassuming that perching ourselves on a piece
p42
aVis bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,
p43
aVand find ourselves again.
p44
aVBut on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind,
p45
aVwhat are we really achieving?
p46
aVIt's really only a successful escape.
p47
aVThink of the term we use, "Retreat."
p48
aVThis is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.
p49
aVIt means we've got to get out of here.
p50
aVIs this how we feel about the pressures of our world,
p51
aVthat in order to get inside ourselves,
p52
aVyou have to run for the hills?
p53
aVAnd the problem with escaping your day-to-day life
p54
aVis that you have to come home, eventually.
p55
aVSo when you think about it,
p56
aVwe're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there.
p57
aVAnd eventually, that vacation's got to come to an end.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo my question to you is,
p60
aVcan we find ways to know ourselves without the escape?
p61
aVCan we redefine our relationship with the technologized world
p62
aVin order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek?
p63
aVCan we live here and now in our wired web
p64
aVand still follow those ancient instructions, "Know thyself?"
p65
aVI say the answer is yes.
p66
aVAnd I'm here today to share a new way
p67
aVthat we're working with technology to this end,
p68
aVto get familiar with our inner self like never before \u2014
p69
aVhumanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours
p70
aVto more fully know the self.
p71
aVIt's called thought-controlled computing.
p72
aa(lp73
VYou may or may not have noticed
p74
aVthat I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead.
p75
aVThis is actually a brainwave sensor
p76
aVthat's reading the electrical activity of my brain
p77
aVas I give this talk.
p78
aVThese brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph.
p79
aVLet me show you what it looks like.
p80
aVThat blue line there is my brainwave.
p81
aVIt's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time.
p82
aVThe green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency,
p83
aVwith lower frequencies here
p84
aVand higher frequencies up here.
p85
aVYou're actually looking inside my head as I speak.
p86
aVThese graphs are compelling, they're undulating,
p87
aVbut from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful.
p88
aVThat's why we've spent a lot of time
p89
aVthinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.
p90
aa(lp91
VFor instance,
p92
aVwhat if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment?
p93
aVOr what if I can take that information
p94
aVand put it into an organic shape up on the screen?
p95
aVThe shape on the right over here
p96
aVhas become an indicator of what's going on in my head.
p97
aVThe more relaxed I am,
p98
aVthe more the energy's going to fall through it.
p99
aVI may also be interested in knowing how focused I am,
p100
aVso I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side.
p101
aVAnd the more focused my brain is,
p102
aVthe more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
p103
aa(lp104
VOrdinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was
p105
aVin any tangible way.
p106
aVAs we know, our feelings about how we're feeling
p107
aVare notoriously unreliable.
p108
aVWe've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it
p109
aVuntil we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it,
p110
aVand then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves
p111
aVa little earlier.
p112
aVThis new awareness opens up vast possibilities
p113
aVfor applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.
p114
aVWe're trying to create technology that uses the insights
p115
aVto make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing
p116
aVand our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever.
p117
aVI'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit,
p118
aVbut first I want to take a look at how we got here.
p119
aVBy the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VMy team at InteraXon and I
p124
aVhave been developing thought-controlled application for almost a decade now.
p125
aVIn the first phase of development,
p126
aVwe were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind.
p127
aVWe were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.
p128
aVWe were transcending the space between the mind and the device.
p129
aVWe brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products
p130
aVthat you could control with your mind,
p131
aVlike thought-controlled home appliances
p132
aVor slot-car games or video games or a levitating chair.
p133
aVWe created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations,
p134
aVand it was really exciting.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics.
p137
aVWe were invited to create a massive installation
p138
aVat the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,
p139
aVwere used in Vancouver,
p140
aVgot to control the lighting on the CN Tower,
p141
aVthe Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls
p142
aVfrom all the way across the country using their minds.
p143
aVOver 17 days at the Olympics, 7,000 visitors from all over the world
p144
aVactually got to individually control the light
p145
aVfrom the CN Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time
p146
aVwith their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away.
p147
aVSo controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut we're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction.
p150
aVAnd so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications
p151
aVin a more complex frame than just control.
p152
aVAnd that was responsiveness.
p153
aVWe realized that we had a system
p154
aVthat allowed technology to know something about you.
p155
aVAnd it could join into the relationship with you.
p156
aVWe created the responsive room
p157
aVwhere the lights, music and blinds adjusted to your state.
p158
aVThey followed these little shifts in your mental activity.
p159
aVSo as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day,
p160
aVon the couch in our office,
p161
aVthe music would mellow with you.
p162
aVWhen you read, the desk lamp would get brighter.
p163
aVIf you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe then realized that if technology could know something about you
p166
aVand use it to help you,
p167
aVthere's an even more valuable application than that.
p168
aVThat you could know something about yourself.
p169
aVWe could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible
p170
aVand come to see things that were previously hidden.
p171
aVLet me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.
p172
aa(lp173
VHere's an application that I created for the iPad.
p174
aVSo the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.
p175
aVSo you use it with your headset.
p176
aVThe headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone.
p177
aVIn that headset, you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.
p178
aVIn the original Zen Bound game,
p179
aVyou play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad.
p180
aVIn the game that we created, of course,
p181
aVyou control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.
p182
aVAs you focus on the wooden form,
p183
aVit rotates.
p184
aVThe more you focus, the faster the rotation.
p185
aVThis is for real.
p186
aVThis is not a fake.
p187
aVWhat's really interesting to me though
p188
aVis at the end of the game, you get stats and feedback about how you did.
p189
aVYou have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing \u2014
p190
aVnot just how much rope you used or what your high score is,
p191
aVbut what was going on inside of your mind.
p192
aVAnd this is valuable feedback
p193
aVthat we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.
p194
aa(lp195
VI like to call this "intra-active."
p196
aVNormally, we think about technology as interactive.
p197
aVThis technology is intra-active.
p198
aVIt understands what's inside of you
p199
aVand builds a sort of responsive relationship
p200
aVbetween you and your technology
p201
aVso that you can use this information to move you forward.
p202
aVSo you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.
p203
aVAt InteraXon \u2014
p204
aVintra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.
p205
aVIt's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside
p206
aVinto this tight loop.
p207
aa(lp208
VFor example, thought-controlled computing
p209
aVcan teach children with ADD how to improve their focus.
p210
aVWith ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states
p211
aVand a high proportion of theta states.
p212
aVSo you can create applications that reward focused brain states.
p213
aVSo you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves
p214
aVand improving their ADD symptoms as they do it.
p215
aVThis can be as effective as Ritalin.
p216
aVPerhaps even more importantly,
p217
aVthought-controlled computing can give children with ADD
p218
aVinsights into their own fluctuating mental states,
p219
aVso they can better understand themselves and their learning needs.
p220
aVThe way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves
p221
aVwill upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas
p222
aVthat people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe can peer inside our heads
p225
aVand interact with what was once locked away from us,
p226
aVwhat once mystified and separated us.
p227
aVBrainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions
p228
aVand find the best solutions for our needs.
p229
aVImagine this collected awareness of the individual
p230
aVcomputed and reflected across an entire lifespan.
p231
aVImagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.
p232
aVIt would be like plugging into your own personal Google.
p233
aa(lp234
VOn the subject of Google,
p235
aVtoday you can search and tag images
p236
aVbased on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them.
p237
aVYou can tag pictures of baby animals as happy,
p238
aVor whatever baby animals are to you,
p239
aVand then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings,
p240
aVrather than the keywords that just hint at them.
p241
aVOr you could tag Facebook photos
p242
aVwith the emotions that you had associated with those memories
p243
aVand then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention,
p244
aVjust like this.
p245
aVHumanizing technology is about taking what's already natural
p246
aVabout the human-tech experience
p247
aVand building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
p248
aVAs it aligns with our human behaviors,
p249
aVit can allow us to make better sense of what we do
p250
aVand, more importantly, why.
p251
aVCreating a big picture out of all the important little details
p252
aVthat make up who we are.
p253
aa(lp254
VWith humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.
p255
aVWhen our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data
p256
aVand see how we can make more effective balance between work and play.
p257
aVDo you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self,
p258
aVwhat triggers cause you to be depressed
p259
aVor what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?
p260
aVImagine if you had access to data
p261
aVthat allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness
p262
aVwhich people in your life made you the happiest,
p263
aVor what activities brought you joy.
p264
aVWould you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize?
p265
aVWould you get a divorce?
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VWhat thought-controlled computing can allow you to do
p270
aVis build colorful layered pictures of our lives.
p271
aVAnd with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings
p272
aVand build a story of our behaviors over time.
p273
aVWe can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward
p274
aVand tell us about what's going on.
p275
aVAnd from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome
p276
aVand the character of our personal stories.
p277
aa(lp278
VTwo millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights.
p279
aVThey knew that a fundamental piece falls into place
p280
aVwhen you start to live out their little phrase,
p281
aVwhen you come into contact with yourself.
p282
aVThey understood the power of human narrative
p283
aVand the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing.
p284
aVBut they understood something more fundamental \u2014
p285
aVthe sheer joy in discovery,
p286
aVthe delight and fascination that we get from the world
p287
aVand being ourselves in it;
p288
aVthe richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.
p289
aa(lp290
VMy mom's an artist,
p291
aVand as a child, I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush.
p292
aVOne moment, it was all white space, pure possibility.
p293
aVThe next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions.
p294
aVAs I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas,
p295
aVI learned that you could create your own world.
p296
aVI learned that our own inner worlds \u2014
p297
aVour ideas, emotions and imaginations \u2014
p298
aVwere, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies.
p299
aVIf you could think it, if you could discover it,
p300
aVyou could bring it to life.
p301
aa(lp302
VTo me, thought-controlled computing
p303
aVis as simple and powerful as a paintbrush \u2014
p304
aVone more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us.
p305
aVI look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side,
p306
aVwatching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes
p307
aVand the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.
p308
