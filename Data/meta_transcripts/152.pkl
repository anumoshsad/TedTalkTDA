(lp2
(lp3
VIt's very, very difficult
p4
aVto speak at the end of a conference like this,
p5
aVbecause everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.
p6
aVSo I thought that what may be useful is to remind us
p7
aVof some of the things that have gone on here,
p8
aVand then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,
p9
aVand take forward and work on.
p10
aVThat's what I'd like to try and do.
p11
aVWe came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."
p12
aVBut we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"
p13
aVbecause we are looking at the old and the present chapter \u2014 that we're looking at,
p14
aVand saying it's not such a good thing.
p15
aVThe picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease
p16
aVis what we usually see.
p17
aVWhat we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"
p18
aVand that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.
p19
aVAnd I think it's worth remembering what we've heard
p20
aVthrough the conference right from the first day,
p21
aVwhere I heard that all the important statistics have been given \u2014
p22
aVabout where we are now,
p23
aVabout how the continent is doing much better.
p24
aVAnd the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I'm not going to spend too much time \u2014
p27
aVjust to show you, refresh your memories
p28
aVthat we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time
p29
aVthere really is a platform to build on.
p30
aVWe really do have it going right
p31
aVthat the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
p32
aVAfter decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,
p33
aVand it's going to \u2014 projected \u2014 6 and 7 percent even.
p34
aVAnd inflation has come down.
p35
aVExternal debt \u2014 something that I can tell you a long story about
p36
aVbecause I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent \u2014
p37
aVhas come down dramatically.
p38
aVYou know, as you can see,
p39
aVfrom almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
p40
aVNow this is a huge achievement.
p41
aa(lp42
VYou know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?
p43
aVIt's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies
p44
aVand gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
p45
aVWe've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference
p46
aVbecause private investment flows have increased.
p47
aVI want to remind you again \u2014
p48
aVI know you saw these statistics before \u2014
p49
aVfrom almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
p50
aVIn 2005, remittances \u2014 I just took one country, Nigeria
p51
aVskyrocketing \u2014 skyrocketing is too dramatic,
p52
aVbut increasing dramatically.
p53
aVAnd in many other countries this is happening.
p54
aVWhy is this important? Because it shows confidence.
p55
aVPeople are now confident to bring \u2014
p56
aVif your people in the diaspora bring their money back,
p57
aVit shows other people that, look,
p58
aVthere is emerging confidence in your country.
p59
aVAnd instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?
p62
aVIt's important that we build this platform,
p63
aVthat we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,
p64
aV"Look, we must do something different."
p65
aVBecause we are confronted with a challenge.
p66
aV62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.
p67
aVWhat does this mean?
p68
aVThis means that we have to focus on how our youth
p69
aVare going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.
p70
aVYou have to focus on how to create jobs,
p71
aVmake sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.
p72
aVBut most of all that they are productively engaged in life,
p73
aVand that they are creating the kind of productive environment
p74
aVin our countries that will make things happen.
p75
aVAnd to support this, I just recently \u2014
p76
aVone of the things I've done since leaving government
p77
aVis to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.
p78
aVMost of our countries don't even have any opinion research.
p79
aVPeople don't have voice.
p80
aVThere is no way you can know what people want.
p81
aa(lp82
VOne of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
p83
aVLike in every other country where this has been done,
p84
aVjobs is the top issue.
p85
aVI want to leave this up here and come back to it.
p86
aVBut before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.
p87
aVAnd to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform
p88
aVthat now enables us to move forward \u2014
p89
aVand we mustn't make light of it.
p90
aVIt was only 5, 6, 7 years ago
p91
aVwe couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.
p92
aVWe were going nowhere.
p93
aVThe economies were not growing.
p94
aVWe were having negative per capita growth.
p95
aVThe microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward
p96
aVwas not even there.
p97
aVSo let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,
p98
aVincluding all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
p99
aVCreating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,
p100
aVbuilding institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo now we have this platform we can build on.
p103
aVAnd it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:
p104
aVaid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.
p105
aVAnd someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things
p106
aVis that it's been a simplistic debate.
p107
aVAnd that's not what the debate should be about.
p108
aVThat's engaging in the wrong debate.
p109
aVThe issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,
p110
aVthe private sector and ordinary African people
p111
aVtaking charge of their own lives?
p112
aVHow do we combine all this?
p113
aVTo move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing
p114
aVthat I talked about \u2014 getting young people employed.
p115
aVGetting the creative juices flowing on this continent,
p116
aVmuch of what you have seen here.
p117
aVSo I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.
p118
aVWe need to bring it back to say,
p119
aVwhat is the combination of all these factors
p120
aVthat is going to yield what we want? (Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I want to tell you something.
p123
aVFor me, the issue about aid \u2014
p124
aVI don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side
p125
aVand feel bad about aid.
p126
aVAfrica has been giving the other countries aid.
p127
aVMo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that
p128
aVhe dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.
p129
aVAnd I said, "Mo, you're right. We have \u2014 no, but we've already been doing it!
p130
aVThe U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VIt is all the resources that were taken from Africa,
p135
aVincluding human, that built these countries today!
p136
aVSo when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
p137
aVThe issue is not that.
p138
aVThe issue is how are we using what has been given back.
p139
aVHow are we using it?
p140
aVIs it being directed effectively?
p141
aVI want to tell you a little story.
p142
aVWhy I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
p143
aVFrom 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war \u2014 the Nigeria-Biafra war.
p144
aVAnd in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.
p145
aVWe spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
p146
aVFor the army \u2014 my father joined the army as a brigadier \u2014 the Biafran army.
p147
aVWe were on the Biafran side.
p148
aVAnd we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,
p149
aVbut wherever we could help we did.
p150
aVAt a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
p151
aVWe were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
p152
aVPeople, children were dying of kwashiorkor.
p153
aVI'm sure some of you who are not so young
p154
aVwill remember those pictures.
p155
aVWell, I was in the middle of it.
p156
aa(lp157
VIn the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.
p158
aVWe thought she was going to die.
p159
aVMy father was not there.
p160
aVHe was in the army.
p161
aVSo I was the oldest person in the house.
p162
aVMy sister fell very ill with malaria.
p163
aVShe was three years old and I was 15.
p164
aVAnd she had such a high fever. We tried everything.
p165
aVIt didn't look like it was going to work.
p166
aVUntil we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was
p167
aVlooking at people and giving them meds.
p168
aVNow I put my sister on my back \u2014 burning \u2014
p169
aVand I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.
p170
aVIt was really hot. I was very hungry.
p171
aVI was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
p172
aVWe heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
p173
aVI walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
p174
aVI got there and I saw huge crowds.
p175
aVAlmost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
p176
aVShe was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?
p177
aa(lp178
VI had to crawl in between the legs of these people
p179
aVwith my sister strapped on my back,
p180
aVfind a way to a window.
p181
aVAnd while they were trying to break down the door,
p182
aVI climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
p183
aVThis woman told me it was in the nick of time.
p184
aVBy the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.
p185
aVShe gave a shot of her chloroquine \u2014 what I learned was the chloroquine then \u2014
p186
aVgave her some \u2014 it must have been a re-hydration \u2014
p187
aVand some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
p188
aVIn about two to three hours, she started to move.
p189
aVAnd then they toweled her down because she started sweating,
p190
aVwhich was a good sign.
p191
aVAnd then my sister woke up.
p192
aVAnd about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
p193
aVI strapped her on my back.
p194
aVI walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.
p195
aVI was so happy \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 that my sister was alive!
p196
aVToday she's 41 years old, a mother of three,
p197
aVand she's a physician saving other lives.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhy am I telling that? I'm telling you that because \u2014
p200
aVwhen it is you or your person involved \u2014
p201
aVyou don't care where \u2014 whether it's aid.
p202
aVYou don't care what it is! (Applause)
p203
aVYou just want the person to be alive!
p204
aVAnd now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives \u2014
p205
aVwhich some of the aid we get does on this continent \u2014
p206
aVwhen you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,
p207
aVthey are contributing productively into the economy.
p208
aVAnd as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
p209
aVThese are people who are productive agents in the economy.
p210
aVSo if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,
p211
aVit means they can form the base of production for our economy.
p212
aVAnd by the same token \u2014
p213
aVas someone said yesterday \u2014 if we don't and they die,
p214
aVtheir children will become a burden on the economy.
p215
aVSo even from an economic standpoint,
p216
aVif we leave the social and the humanitarian,
p217
aVwe need to save lives now.
p218
aVSo that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say
p219
aVlet's channel these resources we get into something productive.
p220
aVHowever, I will also tell you that I'm one of those
p221
aVwho doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.
p222
aVThat's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
p223
aVYou know, we have to use it well.
p224
aa(lp225
VWhat has happened in Europe?
p226
aVDo you all know that Spain \u2014 part of the EU \u2014
p227
aVgot 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?
p228
aVResources that were transferred to them \u2014
p229
aVand were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!
p230
aVThe EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?
p231
aVHave you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.
p232
aVInfrastructure everywhere.
p233
aVIt is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain
p234
aVhas developed into a services economy.
p235
aVDid you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?
p236
aVIreland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
p237
aVFor which many people, even from other parts of the world,
p238
aVare going there to find jobs.
p239
aVWhat did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?
p240
aVThey used it to build an information superhighway,
p241
aVgain infrastructure that
p242
aVenables them to participate in the
p243
aVinformation technology revolution,
p244
aVand to create jobs in their economy.
p245
aVThey didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."
p246
aVToday, the European Union is busy transferring aid.
p247
aVMy frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain \u2014
p248
aVwhich is roads, highways, other things that they can build \u2014
p249
aVI say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid
p250
aVto build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VWhen we ask them and tell them what we need,
p253
aVone of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
p254
aVNow we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that
p255
aVand the EU.
p256
aVWe also have private citizens now who have a lot of money \u2014
p257
aVsome of them in this audience, with private foundations.
p258
aVAnd one day, these foundations have so much money,
p259
aVthey will overtake the official aid that is being given.
p260
aVBut I fear \u2014 and I'm very grateful to all of them
p261
aVfor what they are trying to do on the continent \u2014
p262
aVbut I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly
p263
aVbecause I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
p264
aVAnd they're also going from country to country,
p265
aVand many times trying to find what to do.
p266
aVBut I'm not really sure that their assistance
p267
aVis also being channeled in the right way.
p268
aVAnd many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
p269
aVThey are just discovering.
p270
aVAnd many times I don't see Africans working with them.
p271
aVThey are just going alone! (Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested
p274
aVin hearing from Africans who might know.
p275
aVThey want to visit us,
p276
aVsee what's happening on the ground and make a decision.
p277
aVAnd now I'm maybe being harsh.
p278
aVBut I worry because this money is so important.
p279
aVNow, who are they accountable to?
p280
aVAre we on their boards when they make decisions
p281
aVabout where to channel money? Are we there?
p282
aVWill we make the same mistake that we made before?
p283
aVHave our presidents and our leaders \u2014 everyone is talking about \u2014
p284
aVhave they ever called these people together and said,
p285
aV"Look, your foundation and your foundation \u2014
p286
aVyou have so much money, we are grateful.
p287
aVLet's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled
p288
aVand where this aid should go."
p289
aVHave we done that? The answer is no.
p290
aVAnd each one is making their own individual effort.
p291
aVAnd then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,
p292
aVand we would still have the same problems.
p293
aa(lp294
VThis is what gives us the hopeless image.
p295
aVOur inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,
p296
aV"Sit down."
p297
aVAnd we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.
p298
aVWe've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,
p299
aVand everybody else who is helping and say,
p300
aV"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.
p301
aVAs a continent, here are our priorities.
p302
aVHere is where we want you to channel this money."
p303
aVEach one should not be an entrepreneur
p304
aVgoing out and finding what is best.
p305
aVWe're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.
p306
aVAnd what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
p307
aVTen years from now we will have the same story,
p308
aVand we will be repeating the same things.
p309
aVSo our problem right now is, how can we leverage
p310
aVall this good will that is coming towards our way?
p311
aVHow can we get government to combine properly
p312
aVwith these private foundations, with the international organizations,
p313
aVand with our private sector.
p314
aa(lp315
VI firmly believe in that private sector thing too.
p316
aVBut it cannot do it alone.
p317
aVSo there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
p318
aVThey said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.
p319
aVSo why don't we think of using some of this aid?
p320
aVWell, why don't we first say to those helping us out,
p321
aV"Don't be shy about infrastructure.
p322
aVThat health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.
p323
aVThat education will work better
p324
aVif we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.
p325
aVThat agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
p326
aVDon't be shy of it.
p327
aVInvest some of your resources in that, too."
p328
aVAnd then we can see that this is one combination
p329
aVof private, international, multilateral money,
p330
aVprivate sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,
p331
aVso that aid can be a facilitator.
p332
aVThat is all aid can be.
p333
aVAid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
p334
aVBut it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,
p335
aVwe would have failed.
p336
aa(lp337
VOne of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now \u2014
p338
aVone of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid
p339
aVand China is coming to take resources.
p340
aVIt's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.
p341
aVIf you tell them, "We need a road here,"
p342
aVthey will help you build it.
p343
aVThey don't shy away from infrastructure.
p344
aVIn fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,
p345
aVwhen I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.
p346
aVHe said, "There are two things you need only.
p347
aVInfrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
p348
aVYou are undisciplined." (Applause)
p349
aVAnd I repeat it for the continent.
p350
aVIt's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
p351
aVSo we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
p352
aVNow I realize \u2014 I'm not saying \u2014 health and education \u2014
p353
aVno, you can also provide that as well.
p354
aVBut I'm saying it's not either or.
p355
aVLet's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
p356
aVOne idea.
p357
aVSecond thing, for the private sector,
p358
aVpeople are afraid to take risks on the continent.
p359
aVWhy can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,
p360
aVto enable people to take risk?
p361
aa(lp362
V(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd finally, because they are both standing at my \u2014 I'm out of time.
p365
aVAm I out of time?
p366
aVOK, so let me not forget my punchline.
p367
aVOne of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is
p368
aVto support women, to create jobs. (Applause)
p369
aVA lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
p370
aVBut there are people \u2014 women \u2014 creating jobs.
p371
aVAnd we know, studies have shown
p372
aVthat when you put resources in the hand of the woman \u2014
p373
aVin fact, there's an econometric study,
p374
aVthe World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that
p375
aVtransfers into the hands of women result
p376
aVin healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
p377
aVSo I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here \u2014
p378
aVI'm not saying the men are not important \u2014
p379
aVobviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?
p380
aVThey'll come back home and get disgruntled,
p381
aVand it will result in difficulties we don't want.
p382
aVWe don't want men beating their wives
p383
aVbecause they don't have a job, and so on.
p384
aa(lp385
VBut at the margin, we also \u2014 I want to push this,
p386
aVbecause the reason is the men automatically \u2014
p387
aVthey get \u2014 not automatically, but they tend to get more support.
p388
aVBut I want you to realize that resources
p389
aVin the hands of African women is a powerful tool.
p390
aVThere are people creating jobs.
p391
aVBeatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
p392
aVWe have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.
p393
