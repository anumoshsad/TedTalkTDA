VThis is a photograph
p4
aVby the artist Michael Najjar,
p5
aVand it's real,
p6
aVin the sense that he went there to Argentina
p7
aVto take the photo.
p8
aVBut it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.
p9
aVAnd what he's done
p10
aVis he's actually reshaped, digitally,
p11
aVall of the contours of the mountains
p12
aVto follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.
p13
aVSo what you see,
p14
aVthat precipice, that high precipice with the valley,
p15
aVis the 2008 financial crisis.
p16
aVThe photo was made
p17
aVwhen we were deep in the valley over there.
p18
aVI don't know where we are now.
p19
aVThis is the Hang Seng index
p20
aVfor Hong Kong.
p21
aVAnd similar topography.
p22
aVI wonder why.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd this is art. This is metaphor.
p25
aVBut I think the point is
p26
aVthat this is metaphor with teeth,
p27
aVand it's with those teeth that I want to propose today
p28
aVthat we rethink a little bit
p29
aVabout the role of contemporary math \u2014
p30
aVnot just financial math, but math in general.
p31
aVThat its transition
p32
aVfrom being something that we extract and derive from the world
p33
aVto something that actually starts to shape it \u2014
p34
aVthe world around us and the world inside us.
p35
aVAnd it's specifically algorithms,
p36
aVwhich are basically the math
p37
aVthat computers use to decide stuff.
p38
aVThey acquire the sensibility of truth
p39
aVbecause they repeat over and over again,
p40
aVand they ossify and calcify,
p41
aVand they become real.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I was thinking about this, of all places,
p44
aVon a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,
p45
aVbecause I happened to be seated
p46
aVnext to a Hungarian physicist about my age
p47
aVand we were talking
p48
aVabout what life was like during the Cold War
p49
aVfor physicists in Hungary.
p50
aVAnd I said, "So what were you doing?"
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.
p55
aVHow does that work?"
p56
aVAnd to understand that,
p57
aVyou have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.
p58
aVAnd so \u2014 this is an over-simplification \u2014
p59
aVbut basically, it's not like
p60
aVyou can just pass a radar signal
p61
aVright through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
p62
aVIt's not just going to disappear.
p63
aVBut if you can take this big, massive thing,
p64
aVand you could turn it into
p65
aVa million little things \u2014
p66
aVsomething like a flock of birds \u2014
p67
aVwell then the radar that's looking for that
p68
aVhas to be able to see
p69
aVevery flock of birds in the sky.
p70
aVAnd if you're a radar, that's a really bad job.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.
p73
aVSo we didn't use a radar;
p74
aVwe built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,
p75
aVelectronic communication.
p76
aVAnd whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,
p77
aVwe thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I said, "Yeah.
p80
aVThat's good.
p81
aVSo you've effectively negated
p82
aV60 years of aeronautic research.
p83
aVWhat's your act two?
p84
aVWhat do you do when you grow up?"
p85
aVAnd he said,
p86
aV"Well, financial services."
p87
aVAnd I said, "Oh."
p88
aVBecause those had been in the news lately.
p89
aVAnd I said, "How does that work?"
p90
aVAnd he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,
p91
aVand I'm one of them."
p92
aVAnd I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd he said, "It's funny you ask that,
p95
aVbecause it's actually called black box trading.
p96
aVAnd it's also sometimes called algo trading,
p97
aValgorithmic trading."
p98
aVAnd algorithmic trading evolved in part
p99
aVbecause institutional traders have the same problems
p100
aVthat the United States Air Force had,
p101
aVwhich is that they're moving these positions \u2014
p102
aVwhether it's Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever \u2014
p103
aVthey're moving a million shares of something
p104
aVthrough the market.
p105
aVAnd if they do that all at once,
p106
aVit's like playing poker and going all in right away.
p107
aVYou just tip your hand.
p108
aVAnd so they have to find a way \u2014
p109
aVand they use algorithms to do this \u2014
p110
aVto break up that big thing
p111
aVinto a million little transactions.
p112
aVAnd the magic and the horror of that
p113
aVis that the same math
p114
aVthat you use to break up the big thing
p115
aVinto a million little things
p116
aVcan be used to find a million little things
p117
aVand sew them back together
p118
aVand figure out what's actually happening in the market.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo if you need to have some image
p121
aVof what's happening in the stock market right now,
p122
aVwhat you can picture is a bunch of algorithms
p123
aVthat are basically programmed to hide,
p124
aVand a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.
p125
aVAnd all of that's great, and it's fine.
p126
aVAnd that's 70 percent
p127
aVof the United States stock market,
p128
aV70 percent of the operating system
p129
aVformerly known as your pension,
p130
aVyour mortgage.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd what could go wrong?
p133
aVWhat could go wrong
p134
aVis that a year ago,
p135
aVnine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,
p136
aVand they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.
p137
aVAll of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,
p138
aVand nobody to this day
p139
aVcan even agree on what happened
p140
aVbecause nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.
p141
aVNobody had any control over what was actually happening.
p142
aVAll they had
p143
aVwas just a monitor in front of them
p144
aVthat had the numbers on it
p145
aVand just a red button
p146
aVthat said, "Stop."
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd that's the thing,
p149
aVis that we're writing things,
p150
aVwe're writing these things that we can no longer read.
p151
aVAnd we've rendered something
p152
aVillegible,
p153
aVand we've lost the sense
p154
aVof what's actually happening
p155
aVin this world that we've made.
p156
aVAnd we're starting to make our way.
p157
aVThere's a company in Boston called Nanex,
p158
aVand they use math and magic
p159
aVand I don't know what,
p160
aVand they reach into all the market data
p161
aVand they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.
p162
aVAnd when they find them they pull them out
p163
aVand they pin them to the wall like butterflies.
p164
aVAnd they do what we've always done
p165
aVwhen confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand \u2014
p166
aVwhich is that they give them a name
p167
aVand a story.
p168
aVSo this is one that they found,
p169
aVthey called the Knife,
p170
aVthe Carnival,
p171
aVthe Boston Shuffler,
p172
aVTwilight.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd the gag is
p175
aVthat, of course, these aren't just running through the market.
p176
aVYou can find these kinds of things wherever you look,
p177
aVonce you learn how to look for them.
p178
aVYou can find it here: this book about flies
p179
aVthat you may have been looking at on Amazon.
p180
aVYou may have noticed it
p181
aVwhen its price started at 1.7 million dollars.
p182
aVIt's out of print \u2014 still ...
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVIf you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.
p185
aVA few hours later, it had gone up
p186
aVto 23.6 million dollars,
p187
aVplus shipping and handling.
p188
aVAnd the question is:
p189
aVNobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
p190
aVAnd you see this behavior on Amazon
p191
aVas surely as you see it on Wall Street.
p192
aVAnd when you see this kind of behavior,
p193
aVwhat you see is the evidence
p194
aVof algorithms in conflict,
p195
aValgorithms locked in loops with each other,
p196
aVwithout any human oversight,
p197
aVwithout any adult supervision
p198
aVto say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.
p203
aVAnd so Netflix has gone through
p204
aVseveral different algorithms over the years.
p205
aVThey started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others \u2014
p206
aVthere's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.
p207
aVThey're using Pragmatic Chaos now.
p208
aVPragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,
p209
aVtrying to do the same thing.
p210
aVIt's trying to get a grasp on you,
p211
aVon the firmware inside the human skull,
p212
aVso that it can recommend what movie
p213
aVyou might want to watch next \u2014
p214
aVwhich is a very, very difficult problem.
p215
aVBut the difficulty of the problem
p216
aVand the fact that we don't really quite have it down,
p217
aVit doesn't take away
p218
aVfrom the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.
p219
aVPragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,
p220
aVdetermines, in the end,
p221
aV60 percent
p222
aVof what movies end up being rented.
p223
aVSo one piece of code
p224
aVwith one idea about you
p225
aVis responsible for 60 percent of those movies.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut what if you could rate those movies
p228
aVbefore they get made?
p229
aVWouldn't that be handy?
p230
aVWell, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,
p231
aVand they have "story algorithms" \u2014
p232
aVa company called Epagogix.
p233
aVAnd you can run your script through there,
p234
aVand they can tell you, quantifiably,
p235
aVthat that's a 30 million dollar movie
p236
aVor a 200 million dollar movie.
p237
aVAnd the thing is, is that this isn't Google.
p238
aVThis isn't information.
p239
aVThese aren't financial stats; this is culture.
p240
aVAnd what you see here,
p241
aVor what you don't really see normally,
p242
aVis that these are the physics of culture.
p243
aVAnd if these algorithms,
p244
aVlike the algorithms on Wall Street,
p245
aVjust crashed one day and went awry,
p246
aVhow would we know?
p247
aVWhat would it look like?
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd they're in your house. They're in your house.
p250
aVThese are two algorithms competing for your living room.
p251
aVThese are two different cleaning robots
p252
aVthat have very different ideas about what clean means.
p253
aVAnd you can see it
p254
aVif you slow it down and attach lights to them,
p255
aVand they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.
p256
aVAnd the idea that architecture itself
p257
aVis somehow subject to algorithmic optimization
p258
aVis not far-fetched.
p259
aVIt's super-real and it's happening around you.
p260
aa(lp261
VYou feel it most
p262
aVwhen you're in a sealed metal box,
p263
aVa new-style elevator;
p264
aVthey're called destination-control elevators.
p265
aVThese are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to
p266
aVbefore you get in the elevator.
p267
aVAnd it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.
p268
aVSo none of this mishegas
p269
aVof letting everybody go into whatever car they want.
p270
aVEverybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,
p271
aVand everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.
p272
aVAnd the problem with that
p273
aVis that people freak out.
p274
aVPeople panic.
p275
aVAnd you see why. You see why.
p276
aVIt's because the elevator
p277
aVis missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVLike the things that people use.
p280
aVAll it has
p281
aVis just the number that moves up or down
p282
aVand that red button that says, "Stop."
p283
aVAnd this is what we're designing for.
p284
aVWe're designing
p285
aVfor this machine dialect.
p286
aVAnd how far can you take that? How far can you take it?
p287
aVYou can take it really, really far.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo let me take it back to Wall Street.
p290
aVBecause the algorithms of Wall Street
p291
aVare dependent on one quality above all else,
p292
aVwhich is speed.
p293
aVAnd they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.
p294
aVAnd just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,
p295
aVit takes you 500,000 microseconds
p296
aVjust to click a mouse.
p297
aVBut if you're a Wall Street algorithm
p298
aVand you're five microseconds behind,
p299
aVyou're a loser.
p300
aVSo if you were an algorithm,
p301
aVyou'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt
p302
aVwho was hollowing out a skyscraper \u2014
p303
aVthrowing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,
p304
aVand just running steel on the floors
p305
aVto get ready for the stacks of servers to go in \u2014
p306
aVall so an algorithm
p307
aVcould get close to the Internet.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
p310
aVAnd of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
p311
aVIn New York, this is where it's distributed from:
p312
aVthe Carrier Hotel
p313
aVlocated on Hudson Street.
p314
aVAnd this is really where the wires come right up into the city.
p315
aVAnd the reality is that the further away you are from that,
p316
aVyou're a few microseconds behind every time.
p317
aVThese guys down on Wall Street,
p318
aVMarco Polo and Cherokee Nation,
p319
aVthey're eight microseconds
p320
aVbehind all these guys
p321
aVgoing into the empty buildings being hollowed out
p322
aVup around the Carrier Hotel.
p323
aVAnd that's going to keep happening.
p324
aVWe're going to keep hollowing them out,
p325
aVbecause you, inch for inch
p326
aVand pound for pound and dollar for dollar,
p327
aVnone of you could squeeze revenue out of that space
p328
aVlike the Boston Shuffler could.
p329
aa(lp330
VBut if you zoom out,
p331
aVif you zoom out,
p332
aVyou would see an 825-mile trench
p333
aVbetween New York City and Chicago
p334
aVthat's been built over the last few years
p335
aVby a company called Spread Networks.
p336
aVThis is a fiber optic cable
p337
aVthat was laid between those two cities
p338
aVto just be able to traffic one signal
p339
aV37 times faster than you can click a mouse \u2014
p340
aVjust for these algorithms,
p341
aVjust for the Carnival and the Knife.
p342
aVAnd when you think about this,
p343
aVthat we're running through the United States
p344
aVwith dynamite and rock saws
p345
aVso that an algorithm can close the deal
p346
aVthree microseconds faster,
p347
aVall for a communications framework
p348
aVthat no human will ever know,
p349
aVthat's a kind of manifest destiny;
p350
aVand we'll always look for a new frontier.
p351
aa(lp352
VUnfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.
p353
aVThis is just theoretical.
p354
aVThis is some mathematicians at MIT.
p355
aVAnd the truth is I don't really understand
p356
aVa lot of what they're talking about.
p357
aVIt involves light cones and quantum entanglement,
p358
aVand I don't really understand any of that.
p359
aVBut I can read this map,
p360
aVand what this map says
p361
aVis that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,
p362
aVthat's where people are, where the cities are,
p363
aVyou're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are
p364
aVto do that most effectively.
p365
aVAnd the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots
p366
aVis that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.
p367
aVSo that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,
p368
aVor platforms.
p369
aVWe'll actually part the water
p370
aVto pull money out of the air,
p371
aVbecause it's a bright future
p372
aVif you're an algorithm.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd it's not the money that's so interesting actually.
p377
aVIt's what the money motivates,
p378
aVthat we're actually terraforming
p379
aVthe Earth itself
p380
aVwith this kind of algorithmic efficiency.
p381
aVAnd in that light,
p382
aVyou go back
p383
aVand you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,
p384
aVand you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.
p385
aVThey're prophecy
p386
aVfor the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects
p387
aVof the math that we're making.
p388
aVAnd the landscape was always made
p389
aVby this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration
p390
aVbetween nature and man.
p391
aVBut now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms \u2014
p392
aVthe Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.
p393
aVAnd we will have to understand those as nature,
p394
aVand in a way, they are.
