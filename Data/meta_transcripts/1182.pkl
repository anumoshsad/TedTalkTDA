VThe Highline
p4
aVis an old, elevated rail line
p5
aVthat runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.
p6
aVAnd it was originally a freight line
p7
aVthat ran down 10th Ave.
p8
aVAnd it became known as "Death Avenue"
p9
aVbecause so many people were run over by the trains
p10
aVthat the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,
p11
aVand he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."
p12
aVBut even with a cowboy,
p13
aVabout one person a month
p14
aVwas killed and run over.
p15
aVSo they elevated it.
p16
aVThey built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.
p17
aVBut with the rise of interstate trucking,
p18
aVit was used less and less.
p19
aVAnd by 1980, the last train rode.
p20
aVIt was a train loaded with frozen turkeys \u2014 they say, at Thanksgiving \u2014
p21
aVfrom the meatpacking district.
p22
aVAnd then it was abandoned.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I live in the neighborhood,
p25
aVand I first read about it in the New York Times,
p26
aVin an article that said it was going to be demolished.
p27
aVAnd I assumed someone was working
p28
aVto preserve it or save it
p29
aVand I could volunteer,
p30
aVbut I realized no one was doing anything.
p31
aVI went to my first community board meeting \u2014
p32
aVwhich I'd never been to one before \u2014
p33
aVand sat next to another guy named Joshua David,
p34
aVwho's a travel writer.
p35
aVAnd at the end of the meeting, we realized
p36
aVwe were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;
p37
aVmost people wanted to tear it down.
p38
aVSo we exchanged business cards,
p39
aVand we kept calling each other
p40
aVand decided to start this organization,
p41
aVFriends of the High Line.
p42
aVAnd the goal at first
p43
aVwas just saving it from demolition,
p44
aVbut then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd what first attracted me, or interested me,
p47
aVwas this view from the street \u2014
p48
aVwhich is this steel structure,
p49
aVsort of rusty,
p50
aVthis industrial relic.
p51
aVBut when I went up on top,
p52
aVit was a mile and a half of wildflowers
p53
aVrunning right through the middle of Manhattan
p54
aVwith views of the Empire State Building
p55
aVand the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.
p56
aVAnd that's really where we started,
p57
aVthe idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,
p58
aVand let's have it be sort of inspired
p59
aVby this wildscape.
p60
aa(lp61
VAt the time, there was a lot of opposition.
p62
aVMayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
p63
aVI'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits
p64
aVand a lot of community engagement.
p65
aVMayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,
p66
aVbut we still had to make the economic case.
p67
aVThis was after 9/11;
p68
aVthe city was in tough times.
p69
aVSo we commissioned an economic feasibility study
p70
aVto try to make the case.
p71
aVAnd it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
p72
aVWe thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.
p73
aVSo far it's cost about 150 million.
p74
aVAnd the main case was,
p75
aVthis is going to make good economic sense for the city.
p76
aVSo we said over a 20-year time period,
p77
aVthe value to the city in increased property values
p78
aVand increased taxes
p79
aVwould be about 250 million.
p80
aVThat was enough. It really got the city behind it.
p81
aVIt turns out we were wrong on that.
p82
aVNow people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,
p83
aVor will create about a half a billion dollars,
p84
aVin tax revenues for the city.
p85
aVWe did a design competition,
p86
aVselected a design team.
p87
aVWe worked with them to really create a design
p88
aVthat was inspired by that wildscape.
p89
aVThere's three sections.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe opened the fist section in 2009.
p92
aVIt's been successful beyond our dreams.
p93
aVLast year we had about two million people,
p94
aVwhich is about 10 times what we ever estimated.
p95
aVThis is one of my favorite features in section one.
p96
aVIt's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.
p97
aVAnd the first section ends at 20th St. right now.
p98
aVThe other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;
p99
aVit's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.
p100
aVThere's a point, you can stand here
p101
aVand see buildings by Frank Gehry,
p102
aVJean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,
p103
aVNeil Denari.
p104
aVAnd the Whitney is moving downtown
p105
aVand is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.
p106
aVAnd this has been designed by Renzo Piano.
p107
aVAnd they're going to break ground in May.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd we've already started construction on section two.
p110
aVThis is one of my favorite features,
p111
aVthis flyover where you're eight feet
p112
aVoff the surface of the High Line,
p113
aVrunning through a canopy of trees.
p114
aVThe High Line used to be covered in billboards,
p115
aVand so we've taken a playful take
p116
aVwhere, instead of framing advertisements,
p117
aVit's going to frame people in views of the city.
p118
aVThis was just installed last month.
p119
aVAnd then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,
p120
aVwhich is the largest undeveloped site
p121
aVin Manhattan.
p122
aVAnd the city has planned \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014
p123
aV12 million square-feet of development
p124
aVthat the High Line is going to ring around.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut what really, I think, makes the High Line special
p127
aVis the people.
p128
aVAnd honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,
p129
aVI was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,
p130
aVbecause I fell in love with that wildscape \u2014
p131
aVand how could you recreate that magic?
p132
aVBut what I found
p133
aVis it's in the people and how they use it
p134
aVthat, to me, makes it so special.
p135
aVJust one quick example
p136
aVis I realized right after we opened
p137
aVthat there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.
p138
aVAnd I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;
p139
aVwe just don't do that outside.
p140
aVBut you see that happening on the High Line,
p141
aVand I think that's the power
p142
aVthat public space can have
p143
aVto transform how people experience their city
p144
aVand interact with each other.
