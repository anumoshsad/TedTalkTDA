p5
aVand he stops at a pub to get a drink.
p6
aVAnd the only people in there is a bartender
p7
aVand an old man nursing a beer.
p8
aVAnd he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.
p9
aVAnd suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,
p10
aV"You see this bar?
p11
aVI built this bar with my bare hands
p12
aVfrom the finest wood in the county.

aVBut do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."
p15
aVPoints out the window.
p16
aV"You see that stone wall out there?
p17
aVI built that stone wall with my bare hands.
p18
aVFound every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.
p19
aVBut do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."
p20
aVPoints out the window.

p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVis joke telling.
p32
aVIt's knowing your punchline,
p33
aVyour ending,
p34
aVknowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,
p35
aVis leading to a singular goal,
p36
aVand ideally confirming some truth
p37
aVthat deepens our understandings
p38
aVof who we are as human beings.
p39
aVWe all love stories.
p40
aVWe're born for them.
p41
aVStories affirm who we are.
p42
aVWe all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.
p43
aVAnd nothing does a greater affirmation
p44
aVthan when we connect through stories.
p45
aVIt can cross the barriers of time,
p46
aVpast, present and future,
p47
aVand allow us to experience
p48
aVthe similarities between ourselves
p49
aVand through others, real and imagined.

aa(lp51
VThe children's television host Mr. Rogers
p52
aValways carried in his wallet
p53
aVa quote from a social worker
p54
aVthat said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love
p55
aVonce you've heard their story."
p56
aVAnd the way I like to interpret that
p57
aVis probably the greatest story commandment,
p58
aVwhich is "Make me care" \u2014
p59
aVplease, emotionally,
p60
aVintellectually, aesthetically,
p61
aVjust make me care.
p62
aVWe all know what it's like to not care.
p63
aVYou've gone through hundreds of TV channels,
p64
aVjust switching channel after channel,
p65
aVand then suddenly you actually stop on one.
p66
aVIt's already halfway over,
p67
aVbut something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.
p68
aVThat's not by chance,
p69
aVthat's by design.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,
p72
aVhow I was born for it,
p73
aVhow I learned along the way this subject matter?
p74
aVAnd to make it more interesting,
p75
aVwe'll start from the ending
p76
aVand we'll go to the beginning.
p77
aVAnd so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,
p78
aVit would go something like this:
p79
aVAnd that's what ultimately led me
p80
aVto speaking to you here at TED
p81
aVabout story.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd the most current story lesson that I've had
p84
aVwas completing the film I've just done
p85
aVthis year in 2012.
p86
aVThe film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"
p87
aVwhich was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
p88
aVAnd Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself
p89
aVas a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.
p90
aVAnd he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion
p91
aVwith a telegram saying, "See me at once."
p92
aVBut once he gets there,
p93
aVhe's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away
p94
aVand been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.
p97
aVThing only opens from the inside.
p98
aVHe insisted,
p99
aVno embalming, no open coffin,
p100
aVno funeral.
p101
aVYou don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded
p102
aVby being like the rest of us, huh?
p103
aVCome, let's go inside.
p104
aa(lp105
VAS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,
p106
aVis it's fundamentally making a promise.
p107
aVIt's making a promise to you
p108
aVthat this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.
p109
aVAnd that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.
p110
aVYou could do it an infinite amount of ways.
p111
aVSometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "
p112
aVThese Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.
p113
aVAnd I always thought it was such a fantastic device.
p114
aVIt's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,
p115
aVor somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.
p116
aVIt didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,
p117
aVbut it's going to be worth your time."
p118
aVA well told promise
p119
aVis like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot
p120
aVand propels you forward through the story
p121
aVto the end.
p122
aa(lp123
VIn 2008,
p124
aVI pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time
p125
aVto the limits of my understanding on this project.
p126

V(Video) (Mechanical Sounds)
p128
aV\u266b And that is all \u266b
p129
aV\u266b that love's about \u266b
p130
aV\u266b And we'll recall \u266b
p131
aV\u266b when time runs out \u266b
p132
aV\u266b That it only \u266b
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VAS: Storytelling without dialogue.
p136
aVIt's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.
p137
aVIt's the most inclusive approach you can take.
p138
aVIt confirmed something I really had a hunch on,
p139
aVis that the audience
p140
aVactually wants to work for their meal.
p141
aVThey just don't want to know that they're doing that.
p142
aVThat's your job as a storyteller,
p143
aVis to hide the fact
p144
aVthat you're making them work for their meal.
p145
aVWe're born problem solvers.
p146
aVWe're compelled to deduce
p147
aVand to deduct,
p148
aVbecause that's what we do in real life.
p149
aVIt's this well-organized absence of information
p150
aVthat draws us in.
p151
aVThere's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.
p152
aVIt's not just that they're damn cute;
p153
aVit's because they can't completely express
p154
aVwhat they're thinking and what their intentions are.
p155
aVAnd it's like a magnet.
p156
aVWe can't stop ourselves
p157
aVfrom wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.
p158
aa(lp159
VI first started
p160
aVreally understanding this storytelling device
p161
aVwhen I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."
p162
aVAnd we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.
p163
aVMake the audience put things together.
p164
aVDon't give them four,
p165
aVgive them two plus two.
p166
aVThe elements you provide and the order you place them in
p167
aVis crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.
p168
aVEditors and screenwriters have known this all along.
p169
aVIt's the invisible application
p170
aVthat holds our attention to story.
p171
aVI don't mean to make it sound
p172
aVlike this is an actual exact science, it's not.
p173
aVThat's what's so special about stories,
p174
aVthey're not a widget, they aren't exact.
p175
aVStories are inevitable, if they're good,
p176
aVbut they're not predictable.
p177
aa(lp178
VI took a seminar in this year
p179
aVwith an acting teacher named Judith Weston.
p180
aVAnd I learned a key insight to character.
p181
aVShe believed that all well-drawn characters
p182
aVhave a spine.
p183
aVAnd the idea is that the character has an inner motor,
p184
aVa dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,
p185
aVan itch that they can't scratch.
p186
aVShe gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,
p187
aVAl Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"
p188
aVand that probably his spine
p189
aVwas to please his father.
p190
aVAnd it's something that always drove all his choices.
p191
aVEven after his father died,
p192
aVhe was still trying to scratch that itch.
p193
aVI took to this like a duck to water.
p194
aVWall-E's was to find the beauty.
p195
aVMarlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"
p196
aVwas to prevent harm.
p197
aVAnd Woody's was to do what was best for his child.
p198
aVAnd these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.
p199
aVSometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.
p200
aa(lp201
VI'm really blessed to be a parent,
p202
aVand watching my children grow, I really firmly believe
p203
aVthat you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,
p204
aVand you don't have any say about it,
p205
aVand there's no changing it.
p206
aVAll you can do is learn to recognize it
p207
aVand own it.
p208
aVAnd some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,
p209
aVsome are negative.
p210
aVBut a major threshold is passed
p211
aVwhen you mature enough
p212
aVto acknowledge what drives you
p213
aVand to take the wheel and steer it.
p214
aVAs parents, you're always learning who your children are.
p215
aVThey're learning who they are.
p216
aVAnd you're still learning who you are.
p217
aVSo we're all learning all the time.
p218
aVAnd that's why change is fundamental in story.
p219
aVIf things go static, stories die,
p220
aVbecause life is never static.
p221
aa(lp222
VIn 1998,
p223
aVI had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"
p224
aVand I was completely hooked on screenwriting.
p225
aVSo I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.
p226
aVSo I researched everything I possibly could.
p227
aVAnd I finally came across this fantastic quote
p228
aVby a British playwright, William Archer:
p229
aV"Drama is anticipation
p230
aVmingled with uncertainty."
p231
aVIt's an incredibly insightful definition.
p232
aa(lp233
VWhen you're telling a story,
p234
aVhave you constructed anticipation?
p235
aVIn the short-term, have you made me want to know
p236
aVwhat will happen next?
p237
aVBut more importantly,
p238
aVhave you made me want to know
p239
aVhow it will all conclude in the long-term?
p240
aVHave you constructed honest conflicts
p241
aVwith truth that creates doubt
p242
aVin what the outcome might be?
p243
aVAn example would be in "Finding Nemo,"
p244
aVin the short tension, you were always worried,
p245
aVwould Dory's short-term memory
p246
aVmake her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.
p247
aVBut under that was this global tension
p248
aVof will we ever find Nemo
p249
aVin this huge, vast ocean?
p250
aa(lp251
VIn our earliest days at Pixar,
p252
aVbefore we truly understood the invisible workings of story,
p253
aVwe were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.
p254
aVAnd it's interesting to see
p255
aVhow that led us places
p256
aVthat were actually pretty good.
p257
aVYou've got to remember that in this time of year,
p258
aV1993,
p259
aVwhat was considered a successful animated picture
p260
aVwas "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,"
p261
aV"Aladdin," "Lion King."
p262
aVSo when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,
p263
aVhe walked in and he said,
p264
aV"You don't want me to sing, do you?"
p265
aVAnd I thought that epitomized perfectly
p266
aVwhat everybody thought animation had to be at the time.
p267
aVBut we really wanted to prove
p268
aVthat you could tell stories completely different in animation.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe didn't have any influence then,
p271
aVso we had a little secret list of rules
p272
aVthat we kept to ourselves.
p273
aVAnd they were: No songs,
p274
aVno "I want" moment,
p275
aVno happy village,
p276
aVno love story.
p277
aVAnd the irony is that, in the first year,
p278
aVour story was not working at all
p279
aVand Disney was panicking.
p280
aVSo they privately got advice
p281
aVfrom a famous lyricist, who I won't name,
p282
aVand he faxed them some suggestions.
p283
aVAnd we got a hold of that fax.
p284
aVAnd the fax said,
p285
aVthere should be songs,
p286
aVthere should be an "I want" song,
p287
aVthere should be a happy village song,
p288
aVthere should be a love story
p289
aVand there should be a villain.
p290
aVAnd thank goodness
p291
aVwe were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.
p292
aVThat just gave us more determination
p293
aVto prove that you could build a better story.
p294
aVAnd a year after that, we did conquer it.
p295
aVAnd it just went to prove
p296
aVthat storytelling has guidelines,
p297
aVnot hard, fast rules.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnother fundamental thing we learned
p300
aVwas about liking your main character.
p301
aVAnd we had naively thought,
p302
aVwell Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,
p303
aVso you've got to start from someplace.
p304
aVSo let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?
p307
aVOff the bed.
p308
aVHey, off the bed!
p309
aVMr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?
p310
aVWoody: No, he is.
p311
aVSlinky? Slink ... Slinky!
p312
aVGet up here and do your job.
p313
aVAre you deaf?
p314
aVI said, take care of them.
p315
aVSlinky: I'm sorry, Woody,
p316
aVbut I have to agree with them.
p317
aVI don't think what you did was right.
p318
aVWoody: What? Am I hearing correctly?
p319
aVYou don't think I was right?
p320
aVWho said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?
p321
aa(lp322
VAS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?
p323
aVWe realized, you can make him kind,
p324
aVgenerous, funny, considerate,
p325
aVas long as one condition is met for him,
p326
aVis that he stays the top toy.
p327
aVAnd that's what it really is,
p328
aVis that we all live life conditionally.
p329
aVWe're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,
p330
aVas long as certain conditions are met.
p331
aVAfter that, all bets are off.
p332
aVAnd before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,
p333
aVI can now see key things that happened in my youth
p334
aVthat really sort of opened my eyes
p335
aVto certain things about story.
p336
aa(lp337
VIn 1986, I truly understood the notion
p338
aVof story having a theme.
p339
aVAnd that was the year that they restored and re-released
p340
aV"Lawrence of Arabia."
p341
aVAnd I saw that thing seven times in one month.
p342
aVI couldn't get enough of it.
p343
aVI could just tell there was a grand design under it \u2014
p344
aVin every shot, every scene, every line.
p345
aVYet, on the surface it just seemed
p346
aVto be depicting his historical lineage
p347
aVof what went on.
p348
aVYet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?
p349
aVAnd it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,
p350
aVthat the veil was lifted
p351
aVand it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert
p352
aVand he's reached the Suez Canal,
p353
aVand I suddenly got it.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
p356
aVCyclist: Who are you?
p357
aVWho are you?
p358
aa(lp359
VAS: That was the theme: Who are you?
p360
aVHere were all these seemingly disparate
p361
aVevents and dialogues
p362
aVthat just were chronologically telling the history of him,
p363
aVbut underneath it was a constant,
p364
aVa guideline, a road map.
p365
aVEverything Lawrence did in that movie
p366
aVwas an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.
p367
aVA strong theme is always running through
p368
aVa well-told story.
p369
aa(lp370
VWhen I was five,
p371
aVI was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient
p372
aVthat I feel a story should have,
p373
aVbut is rarely invoked.
p374
aVAnd this is what my mother took me to when I was five.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.
p377
aVLook.
p378
aVThe water's stiff.
p379
aVBambi: Yippee!
p380
aVThumper: Some fun,
p381
aVhuh, Bambi?
p382
aVCome on. Get up.
p383
aVLike this.
p384
aVHa ha. No, no, no.
p385
aa(lp386
VAS: I walked out of there
p387
aVwide-eyed with wonder.
p388
aVAnd that's what I think the magic ingredient is,
p389
aVthe secret sauce,
p390
aVis can you invoke wonder.
p391
aVWonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
p392
aVIt can't be artificially evoked.
p393
aVFor me, there's no greater ability
p394
aVthan the gift of another human being giving you that feeling \u2014
p395
aVto hold them still just for a brief moment in their day
p396
aVand have them surrender to wonder.
p397
aVWhen it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,
p398
aVit reaches you almost to a cellular level.
p399
aVAnd when an artist does that to another artist,
p400
aVit's like you're compelled to pass it on.
p401
aVIt's like a dormant command
p402
aVthat suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.
p403
aVDo unto others what's been done to you.
p404
aVThe best stories infuse wonder.
p405
aa(lp406
VWhen I was four years old,
p407
aVI have a vivid memory
p408
aVof finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle
p409
aVand asking my dad what they were.
p410
aVAnd he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,
p411
aVbut I couldn't see them because of my hair.
p412
aVAnd he explained that when I was born,
p413
aVI was born premature,
p414
aVthat I came out much too early,
p415
aVand I wasn't fully baked;
p416
aVI was very, very sick.
p417
aVAnd when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,
p418
aVhe looked straight at my mom and said,
p419
aV"He's not going to live."
p420
aVAnd I was in the hospital for months.
p421
aVAnd many blood transfusions later,
p422
aVI lived,
p423
aVand that made me special.
p424
aa(lp425
VI don't know if I really believe that.
p426
aVI don't know if my parents really believe that,
p427
aVbut I didn't want to prove them wrong.
p428
aVWhatever I ended up being good at,
p429
aVI would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.
p430
aa(lp431

p433
aVIt's okay, daddy's here.

aVDaddy's got you.
p435
aVI promise,
p436
aVI will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.
p437
aa(lp438
VAS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.
p439
aVUse what you know. Draw from it.
p440
aVIt doesn't always mean plot or fact.
p441
aVIt means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,
p442
aVexpressing values you personally feel
p443
aVdeep down in your core.
p444
aVAnd that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you
p445
