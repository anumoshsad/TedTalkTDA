VFrancesca Fedeli: Ciao.
p4
aVSo he's Mario. He's our son.
p5
aVHe was born two and a half years ago,
p6
aVand I had a pretty tough pregnancy
p7
aVbecause I had to stay still in a bed for, like, eight months.
p8
aVBut in the end everything seemed to be under control.
p9
aVSo he got the right weight at birth.
p10
aVHe got the right Apgar index.
p11
aVSo we were pretty reassured by this.
p12
aVBut at the end, 10 days later after he was born,
p13
aVwe discovered that he had a stroke.
p14
aVAs you might know,
p15
aVa stroke is a brain injury.
p16
aVA perinatal stroke could be something
p17
aVthat can happen during the nine months of pregnancy
p18
aVor just suddenly after the birth,
p19
aVand in his case, as you can see,
p20
aVthe right part of his brain has gone.
p21
aVSo the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body
p22
aVcould be the fact that he couldn't be able to control
p23
aVthe left side of his body.
p24
aVJust imagine, if you have a computer and a printer
p25
aVand you want to transmit, to input to print out a document,
p26
aVbut the printer doesn't have the right drives,
p27
aVso the same is for Mario.
p28
aVIt's just like, he would like to move his left side
p29
aVof his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input
p30
aVto move his left arm and left leg.
p31
aVSo life had to change.
p32
aVWe needed to change our schedule.
p33
aVWe needed to change the impact that this birth had
p34
aVon our life.
p35
aVRoberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,
p36
aVunfortunately, we were not ready.
p37
aVNobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities,
p38
aVand as many questions as possible started
p39
aVto come to our minds.
p40
aVAnd that has been really a tough time.
p41
aVQuestions, some basics, like, you know,
p42
aVwhy did this happen to us?
p43
aVAnd what went wrong?
p44
aVSome more tough, like, really,
p45
aVwhat will be the impact on Mario's life?
p46
aVI mean, at the end, will he be able to work?
p47
aVWill he be able to be normal?
p48
aVAnd, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time,
p49
aVwhy is he not going to be better than us?
p50
aVAnd this, indeed, really is tough to say,
p51
aVbut a few months later, we realized that
p52
aVwe were really feeling like a failure.
p53
aVI mean, the only real product of our life,
p54
aVat the end, was a failure.
p55
aVAnd you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself,
p56
aVbut it was a failure that will impact his full life.
p57
aVHonestly, we went down.
p58
aVI mean we went really down, but at the end,
p59
aVwe started to look at him,
p60
aVand we said, we have to react.
p61
aVSo immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life.
p62
aVWe started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation,
p63
aVand one of the paths that we were following
p64
aVin terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot.
p65
aVBasically, we spent months doing this with Mario.
p66
aVYou have an object, and we showed him
p67
aVhow to grab the object.
p68
aVNow, the theory of mirror neurons simply says
p69
aVthat in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this,
p70
aVyou are activating exactly the same neurons
p71
aVas if you do the actions.
p72
aVIt looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation.
p73
aVBut one day we found that Mario
p74
aVwas not looking at our hand.
p75
aVHe was looking at us.
p76
aVWe were his mirror.
p77
aVAnd the problem, as you might feel,
p78
aVis that we were down, we were depressed,
p79
aVwe were looking at him as a problem,
p80
aVnot as a son, not from a positive perspective.
p81
aVAnd that day really changed our perspective.
p82
aVWe realized that we had to become
p83
aVa better mirror for Mario.
p84
aVWe restarted from our strengths,
p85
aVand at the same time we restarted from his strengths.
p86
aVWe stopped looking at him as a problem,
p87
aVand we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve.
p88
aVAnd really, this was the change,
p89
aVand from our side, we said,
p90
aV"What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario?"
p91
aVAnd we started from our passions.
p92
aVI mean, at the end, my wife and myself
p93
aVare quite different,
p94
aVbut we have many things in common.
p95
aVWe love to travel, we love music,
p96
aVwe love to be in places like this,
p97
aVand we started to bring Mario with us
p98
aVjust to show to him the best things that we can show to him.
p99
aVThis short video is from last week.
p100
aVI am not saying \u2014
p101
aV(Applause) \u2014
p102
aVI am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message,
p103
aVbecause we are just at the beginning of the path.
p104
aVBut we want to share what was the key learning,
p105
aVthe key learning that Mario drove to us,
p106
aVand it is to consider what you have as a gift
p107
aVand not only what you miss,
p108
aVand to consider what you miss just as an opportunity.
p109
aVAnd this is the message that we want to share with you.
p110
aVThis is why we are here.
p111
aVMario!
p112
aVAnd this is why \u2014
p113
aV(Applause) \u2014
p114
aVAnd this is why
p115
aVwe decided to share the best mirror in the world with him.
p116
aVAnd we thank you so much, all of you.
p117
aVFF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aVFF: Thank you. (Applause)
