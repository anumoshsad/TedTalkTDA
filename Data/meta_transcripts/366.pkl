VI grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me
p4
aVwhen I was between seven and 10 years old.
p5
aVAnd I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew
p6
aVwere able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them \u2014
p7
aVhow few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,
p8
aVsatisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security
p9
aVwas destroyed by the war.
p10
aVSo I became interested in understanding
p11
aVwhat contributed to a life that was worth living.
p12
aVAnd I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy
p13
aVand to get involved in art and religion and many other ways
p14
aVthat I could see as a possible answer to that question.
p15
aVAnd finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.
p16
aa(lp17
VI was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money
p18
aVto actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and
p19
aVI didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the \u2014
p20
aVI read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation
p21
aVby someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,
p22
aVand it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.
p23
aVAnd I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,
p24
aVat least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
p25
aVAnd the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
p26
aVInstead of talking about little green men,
p27
aVhe talked about how the psyche of the Europeans
p28
aVhad been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting
p29
aVflying saucers into the sky.
p30
aVHe talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion
p31
aVwere kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain
p32
aVsome sense of order after the chaos of war.
p33
aVAnd this seemed very interesting to me.
p34
aVAnd I started reading his books after that lecture.
p35
aVAnd that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.
p36
aa(lp37
VThen I came to this country to study psychology
p38
aVand I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.
p39
aVThis is a typical result that many people have presented,
p40
aVand there are many variations on it.
p41
aVBut this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people
p42
aVsurveyed in the United States since 1956
p43
aVsay that their life is very happy.
p44
aVAnd that hasn't changed at all.
p45
aVWhereas the personal income,
p46
aVon a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,
p47
aVhas more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.
p48
aVBut you find essentially the same results,
p49
aVnamely, that after a certain basic point \u2014 which corresponds more or less
p50
aVto just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level \u2014
p51
aVincreases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
p52
aVIn fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,
p53
aVmaterial resources, contributes to unhappiness,
p54
aVbut the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo my research has been focused more on \u2014
p57
aVafter finding out these things that actually corresponded
p58
aVto my own experience, I tried to understand:
p59
aVwhere \u2014 in everyday life, in our normal experience \u2014
p60
aVdo we feel really happy?
p61
aVAnd to start
p62
aVthose studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people \u2014
p63
aVfirst artists and scientists, and so forth \u2014 trying to understand
p64
aVwhat made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life
p65
aVdoing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,
p66
aVbut which made their life meaningful and worth doing.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.
p69
aVAnd the interview was 40 pages long.
p70
aVBut this little excerpt is a very good summary
p71
aVof what he was saying during the interview.
p72
aVAnd it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
p73
aVAnd he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, "ecstasy" in Greek meant
p76
aVsimply to stand to the side of something.
p77
aVAnd then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state
p78
aVwhere you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
p79
aVSo ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.
p80
aVAnd it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about
p81
aVthe civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement \u2014
p82
aVwhether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,
p83
aVor the Mayas, or Egyptians \u2014 what we know about them
p84
aVis really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.
p85
aVWe know the temples they built, where people could come
p86
aVto experience a different reality.
p87
aVWe know about the circuses,
p88
aVthe arenas, the theaters.
p89
aVThese are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went
p90
aVto experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,
p93
aVwhich is also \u2014 this place, this arena, which is built
p94
aVlike a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.
p95
aVWe are participating in a reality that is different
p96
aVfrom that of the everyday life that we're used to.
p97
aVBut this man doesn't need to go there.
p98
aVHe needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,
p99
aVand as he does that, he can imagine sounds
p100
aVthat had not existed before in that particular combination.
p101
aVSo once he gets to that point of beginning to create,
p102
aVlike Jennifer did in her improvisation,
p103
aVa new reality \u2014 that is, a moment of ecstasy \u2014
p104
aVhe enters that different reality.
p105
aVNow he says also that this is so intense an experience
p106
aVthat it feels almost as if he didn't exist.
p107
aVAnd that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.
p108
aVBut actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing
p109
aVmore than about 110 bits of information per second.
p110
aVAnd in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,
p111
aVyou need to process about 60 bits per second.
p112
aVThat's why you can't hear more than two people.
p113
aVYou can't understand more than two people talking to you.
p114
aa(lp115
VWell, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process
p116
aVof creating something new, as this man is,
p117
aVhe doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor
p118
aVhow his body feels, or his problems at home.
p119
aVHe can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
p120
aVHis body disappears,
p121
aVhis identity disappears from his consciousness,
p122
aVbecause he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,
p123
aVto really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,
p124
aVand at the same time to feel that he exists.
p125
aVSo existence is temporarily suspended.
p126
aVAnd he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
p127
aVNow, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel
p128
aVany awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what it's telling you here
p131
aVis that obviously this automatic,
p132
aVspontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone
p133
aVwho is very well trained and who has developed technique.
p134
aVAnd it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity
p135
aVthat you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years
p136
aVof technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.
p137
aVWhether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long
p138
aVto be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better
p139
aVthan what was there before.
p140
aVNow, when that happens,
p141
aVhe says the music just flows out.
p142
aVAnd because all of these people I started interviewing \u2014
p143
aVthis was an interview which is over 30 years old \u2014
p144
aVso many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow
p145
aVthat I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
p146
aVAnd it happens in different realms.
p147
aa(lp148
VFor instance, a poet describes it in this form.
p149
aVThis is by a student of mine who interviewed
p150
aVsome of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
p151
aVAnd it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling
p152
aVthat you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
p153
aVThis poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky \u2014
p154
aVa very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave
p155
aVas to how he imagined the forces of relativity,
p156
aVwhen he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
p157
aVBut it happens in other activities.
p158
aVFor instance, this is another student of mine,
p159
aVSusan Jackson from Australia, who did work
p160
aVwith some of the leading athletes in the world.
p161
aVAnd you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,
p162
aVthe same essential description of the phenomenology
p163
aVof the inner state of the person.
p164
aVYou don't think; it goes automatically,
p165
aVif you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
p166
aa(lp167
VIt happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,
p168
aVcalled "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs
p169
aVwho had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful
p170
aVand very ethical, very socially responsible.
p171
aVYou see that these people define success
p172
aVas something that helps others and at the same time
p173
aVmakes you feel happy as you are working at it.
p174
aVAnd like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,
p175
aVyou can't have just one of these things be successful
p176
aVif you want a meaningful and successful job.
p177
aVAnita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.
p178
aVShe is the founder of Body Shop,
p179
aVthe natural cosmetics king.
p180
aVIt's kind of a passion that comes
p181
aVfrom doing the best and having flow while you're working.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,
p184
aVwho was at that time starting out Sony without any money,
p185
aVwithout a product \u2014 they didn't have a product,
p186
aVthey didn't have anything, but they had an idea.
p187
aVAnd the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers
p188
aVcan feel the joy of technological innovation,
p189
aVbe aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.
p190
aVI couldn't improve on this as a good example
p191
aVof how flow enters the workplace.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, when we do studies \u2014
p194
aVwe have, with other colleagues around the world,
p195
aVdone over 8,000 interviews of people \u2014 from Dominican monks,
p196
aVto blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds \u2014
p197
aVwho enjoy their work.
p198
aVAnd regardless of the culture,
p199
aVregardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions
p200
aVthat seem to be there when a person is in flow.
p201
aVThere's this focus that, once it becomes intense,
p202
aVleads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:
p203
aVyou know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;
p204
aVyou get immediate feedback.
p205
aVYou know that what you need to do
p206
aVis possible to do, even though difficult,
p207
aVand sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,
p208
aVyou feel part of something larger.
p209
aVAnd once the conditions are present,
p210
aVwhat you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.
p211
aa(lp212
VIn our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.
p213
aVAnd we can measure this very precisely, actually,
p214
aVbecause we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,
p215
aVand whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,
p216
aVwhere you are, what you're thinking about.
p217
aVAnd two things that we measure is the amount of challenge
p218
aVpeople experience at that moment and the amount of skill
p219
aVthat they feel they have at that moment.
p220
aVSo for each person we can establish an average,
p221
aVwhich is the center of the diagram.
p222
aVThat would be your mean level of challenge and skill,
p223
aVwhich will be different from that of anybody else.
p224
aVBut you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.
p225
aa(lp226
VIf we know what that set point is,
p227
aVwe can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,
p228
aVand it will be when your challenges are higher than average
p229
aVand skills are higher than average.
p230
aVAnd you may be doing things very differently from other people,
p231
aVbut for everyone that flow channel, that area there,
p232
aVwill be when you are doing what you really like to do \u2014
p233
aVplay the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,
p234
aVif work is what provides flow for you.
p235
aVAnd then the other areas become less and less positive.
p236
aa(lp237
VArousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.
p238
aVYour skills are not quite as high as they should be,
p239
aVbut you can move into flow fairly easily
p240
aVby just developing a little more skill.
p241
aVSo, arousal is the area where most people learn from,
p242
aVbecause that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone
p243
aVand to enter that \u2014 going back to flow \u2014
p244
aVthen they develop higher skills.
p245
aVControl is also a good place to be,
p246
aVbecause there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
p247
aVIt's not very challenging any more.
p248
aVAnd if you want to enter flow from control,
p249
aVyou have to increase the challenges.
p250
aVSo those two are ideal and complementary areas
p251
aVfrom which flow is easy to go into.
p252
aa(lp253
VThe other combinations of challenge and skill
p254
aVbecome progressively less optimal.
p255
aVRelaxation is fine \u2014 you still feel OK.
p256
aVBoredom begins to be very aversive
p257
aVand apathy becomes very negative:
p258
aVyou don't feel that you're doing anything,
p259
aVyou don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
p260
aVUnfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.
p261
aVThe largest single contributor to that experience
p262
aVis watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.
p263
aVEven though sometimes watching television
p264
aVabout seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,
p265
aVbut that's when you choose a program you really want to watch
p266
aVand you get feedback from it.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo the question we are trying to address \u2014 and I'm way over time \u2014
p269
aVis how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.
p270
aVAnd that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.
p271
aVAnd some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously
p272
aVwithout any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.
p273
aVAnd that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.
p274
