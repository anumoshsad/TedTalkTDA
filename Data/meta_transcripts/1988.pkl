VWe live in a very complex environment:
p4
aVcomplexity and dynamism
p5
aVand patterns of evidence
p6
aVfrom satellite photographs, from videos.
p7
aVYou can even see it outside your window.
p8
aVIt's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,
p9
aVbut the patterns kind of repeat,
p10
aVbut they never repeat exactly.
p11
aVIt's a huge challenge to understand.
p12
aVThe patterns that you see
p13
aVare there at all of the different scales,
p14
aVbut you can't chop it into one little bit and say,
p15
aV"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."
p16
aVI can't use the normal products of reductionism
p17
aVto get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study
p18
aVin a laboratory and say, "Oh,
p19
aVnow that's something I now understand."
p20
aVIt's the whole or it's nothing.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe different scales that give you
p23
aVthese kinds of patterns
p24
aVrange over an enormous range of magnitude,
p25
aVroughly 14 orders of magnitude,
p26
aVfrom the small microscopic particles
p27
aVthat seed clouds
p28
aVto the size of the planet itself,
p29
aVfrom 10 to the minus six
p30
aVto 10 to the eight,
p31
aV14 orders of spatial magnitude.
p32
aVIn time, from milliseconds to millennia,
p33
aVagain around 14 orders of magnitude.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat does that mean?
p36
aVOkay, well if you think about how
p37
aVyou can calculate these things,
p38
aVyou can take what you can see,
p39
aVokay, I'm going to chop it up
p40
aVinto lots of little boxes,
p41
aVand that's the result of physics, right?
p42
aVAnd if I think about a weather model,
p43
aVthat spans about five orders of magnitude,
p44
aVfrom the planet to a few kilometers,
p45
aVand the time scale
p46
aVfrom a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.
p47
aVWe're interested in more than that.
p48
aVWe're interested in the climate.
p49
aVThat's years, that's millennia,
p50
aVand we need to go to even smaller scales.
p51
aVThe stuff that we can't resolve,
p52
aVthe sub-scale processes,
p53
aVwe need to approximate in some way.
p54
aVThat is a huge challenge.
p55
aVClimate models in the 1990s
p56
aVtook an even smaller chunk of that,
p57
aVonly about three orders of magnitude.
p58
aVClimate models in the 2010s,
p59
aVkind of what we're working with now,
p60
aVfour orders of magnitude.
p61
aVWe have 14 to go,
p62
aVand we're increasing our capability
p63
aVof simulating those at about
p64
aVone extra order of magnitude every decade.
p65
aVOne extra order of magnitude in space
p66
aVis 10,000 times more calculations.
p67
aVAnd we keep adding more things,
p68
aVmore questions to these different models.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what does a climate model look like?
p71
aVThis is an old climate model, admittedly,
p72
aVa punch card, a single line of Fortran code.
p73
aVWe no longer use punch cards.
p74
aVWe do still use Fortran.
p75
aVNew-fangled ideas like C
p76
aVreally haven't had a big impact
p77
aVon the climate modeling community.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut how do we go about doing it?
p80
aVHow do we go from that complexity that you saw
p81
aVto a line of code?
p82
aVWe do it one piece at a time.
p83
aVThis is a picture of sea ice
p84
aVtaken flying over the Arctic.
p85
aVWe can look at all of the different equations
p86
aVthat go into making the ice grow
p87
aVor melt or change shape.
p88
aVWe can look at the fluxes.
p89
aVWe can look at the rate at which
p90
aVsnow turns to ice, and we can code that.
p91
aVWe can encapsulate that in code.
p92
aVThese models are around
p93
aVa million lines of code at this point,
p94
aVand growing by tens of thousands of lines of code
p95
aVevery year.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo you can look at that piece,
p98
aVbut you can look at the other pieces too.
p99
aVWhat happens when you have clouds?
p100
aVWhat happens when clouds form,
p101
aVwhen they dissipate, when they rain out?
p102
aVThat's another piece.
p103
aVWhat happens when we have radiation
p104
aVcoming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,
p105
aVbeing absorbed and reflected?
p106
aVWe can code each of those very small pieces as well.
p107
aVThere are other pieces:
p108
aVthe winds changing the ocean currents.
p109
aVWe can talk about the role of vegetation
p110
aVin transporting water from the soils
p111
aVback into the atmosphere.
p112
aVAnd each of these different elements
p113
aVwe can encapsulate and put into a system.
p114
aVEach of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd you get something like this.
p117
aVYou get a beautiful representation
p118
aVof what's going on in the climate system,
p119
aVwhere each and every one of those
p120
aVemergent patterns that you can see,
p121
aVthe swirls in the Southern Ocean,
p122
aVthe tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,
p123
aVand there's two more that are going to pop up
p124
aVin the Pacific at any point now,
p125
aVthose rivers of atmospheric water,
p126
aVall of those are emergent properties
p127
aVthat come from the interactions
p128
aVof all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.
p129
aVThere's no code that says,
p130
aV"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."
p131
aVThere's no code that says, "Have two
p132
aVtropical cyclones that spin around each other."
p133
aVAll of those things are emergent properties.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is all very good. This is all great.
p136
aVBut what we really want to know
p137
aVis what happens to these emergent properties
p138
aVwhen we kick the system?
p139
aVWhen something changes, what happens to those properties?
p140
aVAnd there's lots of different ways to kick the system.
p141
aVThere are wobbles in the Earth's orbit
p142
aVover hundreds of thousands of years
p143
aVthat change the climate.
p144
aVThere are changes in the solar cycles,
p145
aVevery 11 years and longer, that change the climate.
p146
aVBig volcanoes go off and change the climate.
p147
aVChanges in biomass burning, in smoke,
p148
aVin aerosol particles, all of those things
p149
aVchange the climate.
p150
aVThe ozone hole changed the climate.
p151
aVDeforestation changes the climate
p152
aVby changing the surface properties
p153
aVand how water is evaporated
p154
aVand moved around in the system.
p155
aVContrails change the climate
p156
aVby creating clouds where there were none before,
p157
aVand of course greenhouse gases change the system.
p158
aa(lp159
VEach of these different kicks
p160
aVprovides us with a target
p161
aVto evaluate whether we understand
p162
aVsomething about this system.
p163
aVSo we can go to look at
p164
aVwhat model skill is.
p165
aVNow I use the word "skill" advisedly:
p166
aVModels are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.
p167
aVThey're always approximations.
p168
aVThe question you have to ask
p169
aVis whether a model tells you more information
p170
aVthan you would have had otherwise.
p171
aVIf it does, it's skillful.
p172
aVThis is the impact of the ozone hole
p173
aVon sea level pressure, so low pressure, high pressures,
p174
aVaround the southern oceans, around Antarctica.
p175
aVThis is observed data.
p176
aVThis is modeled data.
p177
aVThere's a good match
p178
aVbecause we understand the physics
p179
aVthat controls the temperatures in the stratosphere
p180
aVand what that does to the winds
p181
aVaround the southern oceans.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe can look at other examples.
p184
aVThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991
p185
aVput an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,
p186
aVinto the stratosphere.
p187
aVThat changed the radiation balance of the whole planet.
p188
aVThere was less energy coming in than there was before,
p189
aVso that cooled the planet,
p190
aVand those red lines and those green lines,
p191
aVthose are the differences between what we expected
p192
aVand what actually happened.
p193
aVThe models are skillful,
p194
aVnot just in the global mean,
p195
aVbut also in the regional patterns.
p196
aa(lp197
VI could go through a dozen more examples:
p198
aVthe skill associated with solar cycles,
p199
aVchanging the ozone in the stratosphere;
p200
aVthe skill associated with orbital changes
p201
aVover 6,000 years.
p202
aVWe can look at that too, and the models are skillful.
p203
aVThe models are skillful in response to the ice sheets
p204
aV20,000 years ago.
p205
aVThe models are skillful
p206
aVwhen it comes to the 20th-century trends
p207
aVover the decades.
p208
aVModels are successful at modeling
p209
aVlake outbursts into the North Atlantic
p210
aV8,000 years ago.
p211
aVAnd we can get a good match to the data.
p212
aa(lp213
VEach of these different targets,
p214
aVeach of these different evaluations,
p215
aVleads us to add more scope
p216
aVto these models,
p217
aVand leads us to more and more
p218
aVcomplex situations that we can ask
p219
aVmore and more interesting questions,
p220
aVlike, how does dust from the Sahara,
p221
aVthat you can see in the orange,
p222
aVinteract with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?
p223
aVHow do organic aerosols from biomass burning,
p224
aVwhich you can see in the red dots,
p225
aVintersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?
p226
aVHow does pollution, which you can see
p227
aVin the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,
p228
aVhow does that affect the temperatures at the surface
p229
aVand the sunlight that you get at the surface?
p230
aa(lp231
VWe can look at this across the world.
p232
aVWe can look at the pollution from China.
p233
aVWe can look at the impacts of storms
p234
aVon sea salt particles in the atmosphere.
p235
aVWe can see the combination
p236
aVof all of these different things
p237
aVhappening all at once,
p238
aVand we can ask much more interesting questions.
p239
aVHow do air pollution and climate coexist?
p240
aVCan we change things
p241
aVthat affect air pollution and climate at the same time?
p242
aVThe answer is yes.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo this is a history of the 20th century.
p245
aVThe first one is the model.
p246
aVThe weather is a little bit different
p247
aVto what actually happened.
p248
aVThe second one are the observations.
p249
aVAnd we're going through the 1930s.
p250
aVThere's variability, there are things going on,
p251
aVbut it's all kind of in the noise.
p252
aVAs you get towards the 1970s,
p253
aVthings are going to start to change.
p254
aVThey're going to start to look more similar,
p255
aVand by the time you get to the 2000s,
p256
aVyou're already seeing the patterns of global warming,
p257
aVboth in the observations and in the model.
p258
aa(lp259
VWe know what happened over the 20th century.
p260
aVRight? We know that it's gotten warmer.
p261
aVWe know where it's gotten warmer.
p262
aVAnd if you ask the models why did that happen,
p263
aVand you say, okay, well, yes,
p264
aVbasically it's because of the carbon dioxide
p265
aVwe put into the atmosphere.
p266
aVWe have a very good match
p267
aVup until the present day.
p268
aa(lp269
VBut there's one key reason why we look at models,
p270
aVand that's because of this phrase here.
p271
aVBecause if we had observations of the future,
p272
aVwe obviously would trust them more than models,
p273
aVBut unfortunately,
p274
aVobservations of the future are not available at this time.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo when we go out into the future, there's a difference.
p277
aVThe future is unknown, the future is uncertain,
p278
aVand there are choices.
p279
aVHere are the choices that we have.
p280
aVWe can do some work to mitigate
p281
aVthe emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
p282
aVThat's the top one.
p283
aVWe can do more work
p284
aVto really bring it down
p285
aVso that by the end of the century,
p286
aVit's not much more than there is now.
p287
aVOr we can just leave it to fate
p288
aVand continue on
p289
aVwith a business-as-usual type of attitude.
p290
aVThe differences between these choices
p291
aVcan't be answered by looking at models.
p292
aa(lp293
VThere's a great phrase
p294
aVthat Sherwood Rowland,
p295
aVwho won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry
p296
aVthat led to ozone depletion,
p297
aVwhen he was accepting his Nobel Prize,
p298
aVhe asked this question:
p299
aV"What is the use of having developed a science
p300
aVwell enough to make predictions if, in the end,
p301
aVall we're willing to do is stand around
p302
aVand wait for them to come true?"
p303
aVThe models are skillful,
p304
aVbut what we do with the information from those models
p305
aVis totally up to you.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.
