VThe following are my opinions,
p4
aVand do not reflect the opinions or policies
p5
aVof any particular prosecutor's office.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI am a prosecutor.
p10
aVI believe in law and order.
p11
aVI am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.
p12
aVI believe in accountability
p13
aVand that we should all be safe in our communities.
p14
aVI love my job
p15
aVand the people that do it.
p16
aVI just think that it's our responsibility
p17
aVto do it better.
p18
aa(lp19
VBy a show of hands,
p20
aVhow many of you, by the age of 25,
p21
aVhad either acted up in school,
p22
aVwent somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of,
p23
aVor drank alcohol before your legal age?
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VAll right.
p28
aa(lp29
VHow many of you shoplifted,
p30
aVtried an illegal drug
p31
aVor got into a physical fight \u2014
p32
aVyes, even with a sibling?
p33
aVNow, how many of you ever spent one day in jail
p34
aVfor any of those decisions?
p35
aVHow many of you sitting here today
p36
aVthink that you're a danger to society
p37
aVor should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VPoint taken.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhen we talk about criminal justice reform,
p44
aVwe often focus on a few things,
p45
aVand that's what I want to talk to you about today.
p46
aVBut first I'm going to \u2014 since you shared with me,
p47
aVI'm going to give you a confession on my part.
p48
aVI went to law school
p49
aVto make money.
p50
aVI had no interest in being a public servant,
p51
aVI had no interest in criminal law,
p52
aVand I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.
p53
aa(lp54
VNear the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship
p55
aVin the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.
p56
aVI knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston,
p57
aVplagued by gun violence and drug crime.
p58
aVMy life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.
p59
aVI walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people
p60
aVwho, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom
p61
aVto say two words and two words only:
p62
aV"Not guilty."
p63
aVThey were predominately black and brown.
p64
aVAnd then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor
p65
aVwould make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.
p66
aVThey were predominately white.
p67
aVAs each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom,
p68
aVI couldn't stop but think:
p69
aVHow did they get here?
p70
aVI wanted to know their stories.
p71
aVAnd as the prosecutor read the facts of each case,
p72
aVI was thinking to myself,
p73
aVwe could have predicted that.
p74
aVThat seems so preventable...
p75
aVnot because I was an expert in criminal law,
p76
aVbut because it was common sense.
p77
aa(lp78
VOver the course of the internship,
p79
aVI began to recognize people in the auditorium,
p80
aVnot because they were criminal masterminds
p81
aVbut because they were coming to us for help
p82
aVand we were sending them out without any.
p83
aa(lp84
VMy second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney,
p85
aVand in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.
p86
aVEven in our "worst," I saw human stories.
p87
aVAnd they all contained childhood trauma,
p88
aVvictimization, poverty, loss,
p89
aVdisengagement from school,
p90
aVearly interaction with the police and the criminal justice system,
p91
aVall leading to a seat in a courtroom.
p92
aVThose convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison,
p93
aVand it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom
p94
aVwhy we would spend so much money
p95
aVto keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years
p96
aVwhen we could have reinvested it up front,
p97
aVand perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VMy third year of law school,
p102
aVI defended people accused of small street crimes,
p103
aVmostly mentally ill,
p104
aVmostly homeless,
p105
aVmostly drug-addicted,
p106
aVall in need of help.
p107
aVThey would come to us,
p108
aVand we would send them away without that help.
p109
aVThey were in need of our assistance.
p110
aVBut we weren't giving them any.
p111
aVProsecuted, adjudged and defended
p112
aVby people who knew nothing about them.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.
p115
aVThe unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.
p116
aVThe power dynamic that I came to understand
p117
aVmade me become a prosecutor.
p118
aa(lp119
VI don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.
p120
aVWe know the criminal justice system needs reform,
p121
aVwe know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons,
p122
aVmaking us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.
p123
aVWe know there's another seven million people on probation or parole,
p124
aVwe know that the criminal justice system
p125
aVdisproportionately affects people of color,
p126
aVparticularly poor people of color.
p127
aVAnd we know there are system failures happening everywhere
p128
aVthat bring people to our courtrooms.
p129
aVBut what we do not discuss
p130
aVis how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.
p131
aVWhen we talk about criminal justice reform,
p132
aVwe, as a society, focus on three things.
p133
aVWe complain, we tweet, we protest
p134
aVabout the police, about sentencing laws
p135
aVand about prison.
p136
aVWe rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.
p137
aa(lp138
VIn the fall of 2009,
p139
aVa young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.
p140
aVHe was 18 years old, he was African American
p141
aVand he was a senior at a local public school.
p142
aVHe had his sights set on college
p143
aVbut his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity
p144
aVhe needed to enroll in school.
p145
aVIn a series of bad decisions,
p146
aVhe stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.
p147
aVThis led to his arrest
p148
aVand a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.
p149
aVThe potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.
p150
aVBut what he had little understanding of
p151
aVwas the impact a criminal record would have on his future.
p152
aa(lp153
VI was standing in arraignments that day
p154
aVwhen Christopher's case came across my desk.
p155
aVAnd at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment,
p156
aVI had Christopher's life in my hands.
p157
aVI was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor,
p158
aVand I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make
p159
aVwould impact Christopher's life.
p160
aVChristopher's case was a serious one
p161
aVand it needed to be dealt with as such,
p162
aVbut I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life
p163
aVwas the right answer.
p164
aa(lp165
VFor the most part, prosecutors step onto the job
p166
aVwith little appreciation of the impact of our decisions,
p167
aVregardless of our intent.
p168
aVDespite our broad discretion,
p169
aVwe learn to avoid risk at all cost,
p170
aVrendering our discretion
p171
aVbasically useless.
p172
aVHistory has conditioned us to believe that somehow,
p173
aVthe criminal justice system brings about accountability
p174
aVand improves public safety,
p175
aVdespite evidence to the contrary.
p176
aVWe're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins,
p177
aVso prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative
p178
aVat our case dispositions,
p179
aVor to take risks on people we might not otherwise.
p180
aVWe stick to an outdated method,
p181
aVcounterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want,
p182
aVand that's safer communities.
p183
aa(lp184
VYet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.
p185
aVThey have little appreciation for what we can do.
p186
aVArraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record,
p187
aVmaking it harder for him to get a job,
p188
aVsetting in motion a cycle
p189
aVthat defines the failing criminal justice system today.
p190
aVWith a criminal record and without a job,
p191
aVChristopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.
p192
aVWithout those protective factors in his life,
p193
aVChristopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.
p194
aVThe more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system,
p195
aVthe more likely it would be that he would return again
p196
aVand again and again \u2014
p197
aVall at tremendous social cost to his children, to his family
p198
aVand to his peers.
p199
aVAnd, ladies and gentlemen,
p200
aVit is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.
p201
aa(lp202
VWhen I came out of law school,
p203
aVI did the same thing as everybody else.
p204
aVI came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice,
p205
aVbut I never learned what justice was in my classes \u2014
p206
aVnone of us do.
p207
aVNone of us do.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors
p210
aVin the criminal justice system.
p211
aVOur power is virtually boundless.
p212
aVIn most cases, not the judge,
p213
aVnot the police, not the legislature,
p214
aVnot the mayor, not the governor, not the President
p215
aVcan tell us how to prosecute our cases.
p216
aVThe decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record
p217
aVwas exclusively mine.
p218
aVI would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony,
p219
aVfor a misdemeanor,
p220
aVor at all.
p221
aVI would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal
p222
aVor take the case to trial, and ultimately,
p223
aVI would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail.
p224
aVThese are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered,
p225
aVand we are unaware and untrained
p226
aVof the grave consequences of those decisions.
p227
aa(lp228
VOne night this past summer,
p229
aVI was at a small gathering of professional men of color
p230
aVfrom around the city.
p231
aVAs I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth,
p232
aVas you do as public servant \u2014
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VI noticed across the room,
p237
aVa young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me.
p238
aVAnd I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where,
p239
aVand before I knew it, this young man was hugging me.
p240
aVAnd thanking me.
p241
aV"You cared about me, and you changed my life."
p242
aVIt was Christopher.
p243
aa(lp244
VSee, I never arraigned Christopher.
p245
aVHe never faced a judge or a jail,
p246
aVhe never had a criminal record.
p247
aVInstead, I worked with Christopher;
p248
aVfirst on being accountable for his actions,
p249
aVand then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend.
p250
aVWe recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold
p251
aVand gave them back to Best Buy,
p252
aVand came up with a financial plan
p253
aVto repay for the computers we couldn't recover.
p254
aVChristopher did community service.
p255
aVHe wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future
p256
aVand that of the community.
p257
aVHe applied to college,
p258
aVhe obtained financial aid,
p259
aVand he went on to graduate from a four-year school.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VAfter we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag,
p264
aVto learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston.
p265
aVChristopher had accomplished \u2014 and making a lot more money than me \u2014
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VHe had accomplished all of this
p270
aVin the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court.
p271
aVI can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success,
p272
aVbut I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.
p273
aa(lp274
VThere are thousands of Christophers out there,
p275
aVsome locked in our jails and prisons.
p276
aVWe need thousands of prosecutors
p277
aVto recognize that and to protect them.
p278
aVAn employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one.
p279
aVIt's a bigger win for all of us.
p280
aVIn retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher
p281
aVmakes perfect sense.
p282
aVWhen I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court,
p283
aVI didn't see a criminal standing there.
p284
aVI saw myself \u2014 a young person in need of intervention.
p285
aVAs an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens,
p286
aVI knew firsthand the power of opportunity
p287
aVas opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system.
p288
aVAlong the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney,
p289
aVmy supervisor and judges,
p290
aVI learned the power of the prosecutor
p291
aVto change lives instead of ruining them.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd that's how we do it in Boston.
p294
aVWe helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids
p295
aVget a job.
p296
aVInstead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail
p297
aVfor punching another teenager,
p298
aVwe secured mental health treatment and community supervision.
p299
aVA runaway girl who was arrested
p300
aVfor prostituting, to survive on the streets,
p301
aVneeded a safe place to live and grow \u2014
p302
aVsomething we could help her with.
p303
aVI even helped a young man
p304
aVwho was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school,
p305
aVthat one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack,
p306
aVhe put a loaded 9-millimeter.
p307
aVWe would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases
p308
aVfor months and months for trial down the road
p309
aVby coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.
p310
aa(lp311
VWhich is the better way to spend our time?
p312
aVHow would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs?
p313
aVWhy are we spending 80 billion dollars
p314
aVon a prison industry that we know is failing,
p315
aVwhen we could take that money and reallocate it into education,
p316
aVinto mental health treatment,
p317
aVinto substance abuse treatment
p318
aVand to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VSo why should this matter to you?
p323
aVWell, one, we're spending a lot of money.
p324
aVOur money.
p325
aVIt costs 109,000 dollars in some states
p326
aVto lock up a teenager for a year,
p327
aVwith a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system.
p328
aVThat is a terrible return on investment.
p329
aa(lp330
VNumber two: it's the right thing to do.
p331
aVIf prosecutors were a part of creating the problem,
p332
aVit's incumbent on us to create a solution
p333
aVand we can do that using other disciplines
p334
aVthat have already done the data and research for us.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd number three:
p337
aVyour voice and your vote can make that happen.
p338
aVThe next time there's a local district attorney's election
p339
aVin your jurisdiction,
p340
aVask candidates these questions.
p341
aVOne: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer?
p342
aVTwo: What data are you collecting,
p343
aVand how are you training your prosecutors
p344
aVto make sure that it's working?
p345
aVAnd number three:
p346
aVIf it's not working for everybody,
p347
aVwhat are you doing to fix it?
p348
aVIf they can't answer the questions,
p349
aVthey shouldn't be doing the job.
p350
aa(lp351
VEach one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk
p352
aVis a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity,
p353
aVof intervention,
p354
aVof support
p355
aVand of love.
p356
aVWhile each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline
p357
aVfor whatever malfeasances you committed,
p358
aVbarely any of you needed a day in jail
p359
aVto make you the people that you are today \u2014
p360
aVsome of the greatest minds on the planet.
p361
aa(lp362
VEvery day, thousands of times a day,
p363
aVprosecutors around the United States wield power so great
p364
aVthat it can bring about catastrophe
p365
aVas quickly as it can bring about opportunity,
p366
aVintervention,
p367
aVsupport
p368
aVand yes, even love.
p369
aVThose qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community,
p370
aVand a strong community is a safe one.
p371
aVIf our communities are broken,
p372
aVdon't let the lawyers that you elect fix them
p373
aVwith outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.
p374
aa(lp375
VDemand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail,
p376
aVnot putting them in.
p377
aa(lp378
VDemand better.
p379
aVYou deserve it, your children deserve it,
p380
aVthe people who are tied up in the system deserve it,
p381
aVbut most of all,
p382
aVthe people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.
p383
aa(lp384
VWe must,
p385
aVwe must do better.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Applause)
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you.
p392
aa(lp393

p394
aa(lp395
