VHere's my thing.
p4
aVHold on. There I go. Hey.
p5
aVI want to start today \u2014 talk about the structure of a polypeptide.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI get a lot of people asking me, in terms of "Lost," you know,
p10
aV"What the hell's that island?"
p11
aVYou know, it's usually followed by,
p12
aV"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"
p13
aa(lp14
VWhy so many mysteries?
p15
aVWhat is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to?
p16
aVAnd I was thinking about this, what to talk about at TED.
p17
aVWhen I talked to the kind rep from TED,
p18
aVand I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
p19
aVHe said, "Don't worry about it. Just be profound."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd I took enormous comfort in that.
p24
aVSo thank you, if you're here.
p25
aa(lp26
VI was trying to think, what do I talk about? Good question.
p27
aVWhy do I do so much stuff that involves mystery?
p28
aVAnd I started trying to figure it out.
p29
aVAnd I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,
p30
aVand I started thinking about my grandfather.
p31
aVI loved my grandfather.
p32
aVHarry Kelvin was his name, my mother's father.
p33
aVHe died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.
p34
aVAnd one of the reasons he was amazing:
p35
aVAfter World War II, he began an electronics company.
p36
aVHe started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
p37
aVSo he had this incredible curiosity.
p38
aVAs a kid, I saw him come over to me
p39
aVwith radios and telephones and all sorts of things.
p40
aVAnd he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings \u2014
p41
aVwhich many of us, I'm sure, take for granted.
p42
aVBut it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
p43
aVTo open up this thing and show how it works
p44
aVand why it works and what it is.
p45
aVHe was the ultimate deconstructor, in many ways.
p46
aVAnd my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart,
p47
aVbut he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,
p48
aVlike, you know, printing, like the letter press.
p49
aVI'm obsessed with printing.
p50
aVI'm obsessed with silk-screening and bookbinding and box making.
p51
aVWhen I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.
p54
aVI was just looking at it. And I'm telling you \u2014
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VIt's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.
p59
aVI mean, when you look at the box and you sort of see how it works.
p60
aVRives is here, and I met him years ago at a book fair;
p61
aVhe does pop-up books.
p62
aVAnd I'm obsessed with engineering of paper.
p63
aVThe scoring of it, the printing of it,
p64
aVwhere the thing gets glued, the registration marks for the ink.
p65
aVI just love boxes.
p66
aVMy grandfather was the guy
p67
aVwho kind of got me into all sorts of these things.
p68
aVHe would also supply me with tools.
p69
aVHe was this amazing encourager \u2014 this patron, sort of, to make stuff.
p70
aVAnd he got me a Super 8 camera when I was 10 years old.
p71
aVAnd in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,
p72
aVto be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.
p73
aVAnd you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.
p74
aVHe wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation.
p75
aVI mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,
p76
aV"Listen, Grandpa, I really need this camera.
p77
aVYou don't understand. This is, like, I want to make movies.
p78
aVI'll get invited to TED one day \u2014"
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd, you know, my grandmother was the greatest.
p83
aVBecause she'd be like, you know \u2014 she'd get on the phone.
p84
aVShe'd be like, "Harry, it's better than the drugs.
p85
aVShe was fantastic.
p86
aVSo I found myself getting this stuff, thanks to her assist,
p87
aVand suddenly, you know,
p88
aVI had a synthesizer when I was 14 years old \u2014
p89
aVthis kind of stuff.
p90
aVAnd it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.
p91
aVHe sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.
p92
aVThe thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City
p93
aVcalled Lou Tannen's Magic.
p94
aVIt was this great magic store.
p95
aVIt was a crappy little building in Midtown,
p96
aVbut you'd be in the elevator, the elevator would open \u2014
p97
aVthere'd be this little, small magic store.
p98
aVYou'd be in the magic store. And it was a magical place.
p99
aVSo I got all these magic tricks. Here. I'll show you.
p100
aVThis is the kind of thing. So it would be like, you know.
p101
aVWhich is good, but now I can't move.
p102
aVNow, I have to do the rest of the thing like this.
p103
aVI'm like, "Oh, wow. Look at my computer over there!"
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:
p108
aVTannen's Mystery Magic Box.
p109
aVThe premise behind the Mystery Magic Box was the following:
p110
aV15 dollars buys you 50 dollars worth of magic.
p111
aVWhich is a savings.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding.
p116
aVIf you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.
p117
aVBut I've had this forever.
p118
aVNow, I was looking at this,
p119
aVit was in my office, as it always is, on the shelf,
p120
aVand I was thinking, why have I not opened this?
p121
aVAnd why have I kept it?
p122
aVBecause I'm not a pack rat.
p123
aVI don't keep everything,
p124
aVbut for some reason I haven't opened this box.
p125
aVAnd I felt like there was a key to this, somehow,
p126
aVin talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before,
p127
aVand bored people elsewhere.
p128
aVSo I thought, maybe there's something with this.
p129
aVAnd there was this giant question mark.
p130
aVI love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing.
p131
aVAnd I started thinking, why haven't I opened it?
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd I realized that I haven't opened it
p134
aVbecause it represents something important \u2014 to me.
p135
aVIt represents my grandfather.
p136
aVAm I allowed to cry at TED?
p137
aVBecause \u2014 no, I'm not going to cry.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut \u2014
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThe thing is that it represents infinite possibility.
p146
aVIt represents hope. It represents potential.
p147
aVAnd what I love about this box,
p148
aVand what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do,
p149
aVis I find myself drawn to infinite possibility,
p150
aVthat sense of potential.
p151
aVAnd I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination.
p152
aVNow, it's not the most ground-breaking idea,
p153
aVbut when I started to think that maybe there are times
p154
aVwhen mystery is more important than knowledge.
p155
aVI started getting interested in this.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd so I started thinking about "Lost" and the stuff that we do,
p158
aVand I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!
p159
aVIn the creation of "Lost," Damon Lindelof and I,
p160
aVwho created the show with me,
p161
aVwe were basically tasked with creating this series
p162
aVthat we had very little time to do.
p163
aVWe had 11 and a half weeks
p164
aVto write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.
p165
aVSo it was not a lot of time.
p166
aVAnd that sense of possibility \u2014 what could this thing be?
p167
aVThere was no time to develop it.
p168
aVI'm sure you're all familiar with people
p169
aVwho tell you what you can't do and what you should change.
p170
aVThere was no time for that, which is kind of amazing.
p171
aVAnd so we did this show,
p172
aVand for those of you who haven't seen it, or don't know it,
p173
aVI can show you one little clip from the pilot,
p174
aVjust to show you some stuff that we did.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Engine roaring)
p177
aa(lp178
V(Video) Claire: Help!
p179
aa(lp180
VPlease help me!
p181
aVHelp me! Please, help me!
p182
aa(lp183
VJack: Get him out of here! Get him away from the engine!
p184
aVGet him out of here!
p185
aa(lp186
V(Engine roaring)
p187
aa(lp188
VC: Help me, please! I'm having contractions!
p189
aa(lp190
VJ: How many months pregnant are you?
p191
aa(lp192
VC: I'm only eight months.
p193
aa(lp194
VJ: And how far apart are they coming?
p195
aa(lp196
VC: I don't know. I think it just happened.
p197
aa(lp198
VMan: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
VJJ Abrams: 10 years ago, if we wanted to do that,
p201
aVwe'd have to kill a stuntman.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VIt would be harder.
p206
aVTake two would be a bitch.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo the amazing thing was, we were able to do this thing.
p211
aVAnd part of that was the amazing availability of technology,
p212
aVknowing we could do anything.
p213
aVI mean, we could never have done that.
p214
aVWe might have been able to write it;
p215
aVwe wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did.
p216
aVSo part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process,
p217
aVtechnology is mind-blowingly inspiring to me.
p218
aVI realize that that blank page is a magic box, you know?
p219
aVIt needs to be filled with something fantastic.
p220
aa(lp221
VI used to have the "Ordinary People" script that I'd flip through.
p222
aVThe romance was amazing to me; it would inspire me.
p223
aVI wanted to try and fill pages
p224
aVwith the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion
p225
aVthat that script did.
p226
aVSo, you know, I love Apple computers.
p227
aVI'm obsessed.
p228
aVSo the Apple computer \u2014 the PowerBook \u2014 this computer,
p229
aVit challenges me.
p230
aVIt basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me?
p231
aVI feel this \u2014 I'm compelled.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd I often am like, you know, dude, today I'm out.
p236
aVI got nothing. You know? So there's that.
p237
aa(lp238
VIn terms of the content of it,
p239
aVyou look at stories, you think, what are stories but mystery boxes?
p240
aVThere's a fundamental question \u2014 in TV, the first act is called the teaser.
p241
aVIt's literally the teaser. It's the big question.
p242
aVSo you're drawn into it. Then there's another question.
p243
aVAnd it goes on. Look at "Star Wars."
p244
aVThe droids meet the mysterious woman.
p245
aVWho's that? We don't know. Mystery box! Then you meet Luke Skywalker.
p246
aVHe gets the droid, you see the holographic image.
p247
aVYou learn it's a message. She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.
p248
aVHe's her only hope. But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?
p249
aVMystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.
p250
aVBen Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit! So it keeps us \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VHave you guys not seen that?
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VIt's huge! Anyway \u2014
p259
aVSo there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled.
p260
aVThen there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination \u2014
p261
aVthe withholding of information.
p262
aVYou know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.
p263
aVWhether it's like the shark in "Jaws" \u2014
p264
aVif Spielberg's mechanical shark, Bruce, had worked,
p265
aVit would not be remotely as scary; you would have seen it too much.
p266
aVIn "Alien", they never really showed the alien: terrifying!
p267
aVEven in a movie like a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"
p268
aVthey're having that date, and they're in the car,
p269
aVand it's loud, and so they put the top up.
p270
aVYou don't hear anything they're saying!
p271
aVYou can't hear a word! But it's the most romantic date ever.
p272
aVAnd you love it because you don't hear it.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo to me, there's that. And then, finally, there's this idea \u2014
p275
aVstretching the paradigm a little bit \u2014
p276
aVbut the idea of the mystery box.
p277
aVMeaning, what you think you're getting, then what you're really getting.
p278
aVAnd it's true in so many movies and stories.
p279
aVLook at "E.T.," for example \u2014
p280
aV"E.T." is this unbelievable movie about what?
p281
aVIt's about an alien who meets a kid, right?
p282
aVWell, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.
p283
aV"E.T." is about a heartbroken, divorce-crippled family,
p284
aVand ultimately, this kid who can't find his way.
p285
aV"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun, action-adventure movie in a building.
p286
aVIt's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.
p287
aVHe's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.
p288
aVThere are great scenes \u2014
p289
aVmaybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time,
p290
aVbut pretty great scenes.
p291
aVThere's a half an hour of investment in character
p292
aVbefore you get to the stuff that you're expecting.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhen you look at a movie like "Jaws,"
p295
aVthe scene that you expect \u2014 we have the screen?
p296
aVThese are the kind of scenes
p297
aVthat you remember and expect from "Jaws."
p298
aVAnd she's being eaten;
p299
aVthere's a shark.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Woman screaming)
p302
aa(lp303
VThe thing about "Jaws" is, it's really about a guy
p304
aVwho is sort of dealing with his place in the world \u2014 with his masculinity,
p305
aVwith his family, how he's going to, you know, make it work in this new town.
p306
aVThis is one of my favorite scenes ever,
p307
aVand this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of
p308
aVwhen you think of "Jaws." But it's an amazing scene.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Video) Father: C'mere.
p311
aVGive us a kiss.
p312
aa(lp313
VSon: Why?
p314
aa(lp315
VFather: 'Cause I need it.
p316
aa(lp317
VJJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?
p318
aVBest scene ever, right?
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VCome on! So you think of "Jaws" \u2014
p323
aVso that's the kind of stuff that,
p324
aVlike, you know \u2014 the investment of character,
p325
aVwhich is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?
p326
aVIt's why when people do sequels, or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,
p327
aVthey're ripping off the wrong thing.
p328
aVYou're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster.
p329
aVYou know, if you rip something off \u2014 rip off the character.
p330
aVRip off the stuff that matters.
p331
aVI mean, look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you.
p332
aVBecause ultimately, the mystery box is all of us.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo there's that. Then the distribution.
p335
aVWhat's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater? You know?
p336
aVYou go to the theater, you're just so excited to see anything.
p337
aVThe moment the lights go down is often the best part.
p338
aVAnd you're full of that amazing \u2014 that feeling of excited anticipation.
p339
aVAnd often, the movie's there and it's going,
p340
aVand then something happens and you go, "Oh \u2014", and then, "Mmm ..."
p341
aVWhen it's a great movie, you're along for the ride
p342
aVbecause you're willing to give yourself to it.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo to me, whether it's a TV, an iPod, computer, cell phone \u2014
p345
aVIt's funny, I'm an \u2014 as I said, Apple fanatic \u2014
p346
aVand one day, about a year or so ago,
p347
aVI was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,
p348
aVbecause I always do.
p349
aVAnd he came on, he was presenting the video iPod,
p350
aVand what was on the enormous iPod behind him?
p351
aV"Lost"! I had no idea!
p352
aVAnd I realized, holy shit, it'd come full circle.
p353
aVThe inspiration I get from the technology
p354
aVis now using the stuff that I do to sell technology. It's nuts!
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VI was going to show you a couple of other things I'm going to skip.
p359
aVI'll show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything.
p360
aVThis is something online; six years ago, they did this.
p361
aVThis is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience.
p362
aVBut the point was, that they were doing things
p363
aVthat were using these mystery boxes that they had \u2014 everyone has now.
p364
aVWhat I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,
p365
aVeveryone has access to now.
p366
aVYou don't need to have my grandfather, though you wish you had.
p367
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014
p368
aVthis is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra 950 computer \u2014
p369
aVthe resolution's a little bit low \u2014
p370
aVusing Infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago.
p371
aVHe's doing stuff that looks as amazing
p372
aVas stuff I've seen released from Hollywood.
p373
aa(lp374
VThe most incredible sort of mystery, I think,
p375
aVis now the question of what comes next.
p376
aVBecause it is now democratized.
p377
aVSo now, the creation of media \u2014 it's everywhere.
p378
aVThe stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid
p379
aVis now ubiquitous.
p380
aVAnd so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.
p381
aVAnd when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now
p382
aVwho would have been silenced, you know \u2014
p383
aVwho have been silenced in the past \u2014
p384
aVit's a very exciting thing.
p385
aa(lp386
VI used to say in classes and lectures and stuff,
p387
aVto someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing."
p388
aVIt's free, you don't need permission.
p389
aVBut now I can say, "Go make your movie!" There's nothing stopping you
p390
aVfrom going out there and getting the technology.
p391
aVYou can lease, rent, buy stuff off the shelf
p392
aVthat is either as good, or just as good,
p393
aVas the stuff that's being used by the, you know, "legit people."
p394
aVNo community is best served when only the elite have control.
p395
aVAnd I feel like this is an amazing opportunity
p396
aVto see what else is out there.
p397
aa(lp398
VWhen I did "Mission: Impossible III," we had amazing visual effects.
p399
aVILM did the effects; it was incredible.
p400
aVAnd sort of my dream to be involved.
p401
aVAnd there are a couple of sequences in the movie,
p402
aVlike these couple of moments I'll show you.
p403
aVThere's that.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!
p406
aa(lp407
V(Explosion)
p408
aa(lp409
VObviously, I have an obsession with big crazy explosions.
p410
aVSo my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.
p411
aVIt's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up.
p412
aVHe's drowsy. He's crazy.
p413
aVAnd the guy wakes up, and he shoves this gun in his nose
p414
aVand shoots this little capsule into his brain
p415
aVthat he's going to use later to kill him, as bad guys do.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
p418
aa(lp419
VJJA: OK, now.
p420
aVWhen we shot that scene,
p421
aVthe actor who had the gun, an English actor, Eddie Marsan \u2014
p422
aVsweetheart, great guy \u2014
p423
aVhe kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose,
p424
aVand it was hurting Tom's nose.
p425
aVAnd I learned this very early on in my career:
p426
aVDon't hurt Tom's nose.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Laughter)
p429
aa(lp430
VThere are three things you don't want to do.
p431
aVNumber two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.
p432
aVSo Eddie has this gun \u2014 and he's this sweet English guy.
p433
aVHe's like, "Sorry, I don't want to hurt you."
p434
aVI'm like, "We have to make this look good."
p435
aVAnd I realized that we had to do something because it wasn't working.
p436
aVAnd I thought back to what I would have done
p437
aVusing the Super 8 camera that my grandfather got me
p438
aVsitting in that room,
p439
aVand I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.
p440
aVIt could be Tom's.
p441
aVAnd Tom would know just how hard to push the gun.
p442
aVHe wouldn't hurt himself.
p443
aa(lp444
VSo we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's.
p445
aVWe put it in Eddie's sleeve,
p446
aVand so the hand that you see \u2014
p447
aVthat's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's. So Tom is playing two roles.

aa(lp451
VAnd he didn't ask for any more money.
p452
aVSo here, here. Watch it again.
p453
aVThere he is. He's waking up.
p454
aVHe's drowsy, been through a lot.
p455
aa(lp456
V(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
p457
aa(lp458
VJJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.
