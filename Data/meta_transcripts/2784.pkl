VI have a two-year-old daughter named Naya
p4
aVwho is under the mistaken impression
p5
aVthat this conference is named in honor of her father.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VWho am I to contradict my baby girl?
p10
aa(lp11
VAs many of you know, there's something about becoming a parent
p12
aVthat concentrates the mind on long-term problems like climate change.
p13
aVIt was the birth of my daughter that inspired me
p14
aVto launch this climate organization,
p15
aVin order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue
p16
aVin the United States,
p17
aVand to find a conservative pathway forward.
p18
aVYes, folks, a Republican climate solution is possible,
p19
aVand you know what?
p20
aVIt may even be better.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VLet me try to prove that to you.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat we really need is a killer app to climate policy.
p27
aVIn the technology world, a killer app is an application so transformative
p28
aVthat it creates its own market,
p29
aVlike Uber.
p30
aVIn the climate world,
p31
aVa killer app is a new solution so promising
p32
aVthat it can break through the seemingly insurmountable
p33
aVbarriers to progress.
p34
aVThese include the psychological barrier.
p35
aVClimate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens
p36
aVto make short-term sacrifices now
p37
aVfor benefits that accrue to other people
p38
aVin other countries 30 or 40 years in the future.
p39
aVIt just doesn't fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature.
p40
aa(lp41
VNext is the geopolitical barrier.
p42
aVUnder the current rules of global trade,
p43
aVcountries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions
p44
aVof other nations,
p45
aVinstead of strengthening their own programs.
p46
aVThis has been the curse
p47
aVof every international climate negotiations, including Paris.
p48
aVFinally, we have the partisan barrier.
p49
aVEven the most committed countries \u2014
p50
aVGermany, the United Kingdom, Canada \u2014
p51
aVare nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed.
p52
aVNot even close.
p53
aVAnd the partisan climate divide is far more acute
p54
aVhere in the United States.
p55
aVWe are fundamentally stuck,
p56
aVand that is why we need a killer app of climate policy
p57
aVto break through each of these barriers.
p58
aa(lp59
VI'm convinced that the road to climate progress in the United States
p60
aVruns through the Republican Party
p61
aVand the business community.
p62
aVSo in launching the Climate Leadership Council,
p63
aVI started by reaching out to a who's who of Republican elder statesmen
p64
aVand business leaders,
p65
aVincluding James Baker and George Schultz,
p66
aVthe two most respected Republican elder statesmen in America;
p67
aVMartin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,
p68
aVthe two most respected conservative economists in the country;
p69
aVand Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,
p70
aVtwo of the most successful and admired business leaders.
p71
aVTogether, we co-authored
p72
aV"The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends."
p73
aVThis represents the first time
p74
aVthat Republican leaders put forth
p75
aVa concrete market-based climate solution.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VThank you.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VWe presented our plan at the White House
p84
aVtwo weeks after President Trump moved in.
p85
aVAlmost every leading editorial board in the country
p86
aVhas since endorsed our plan,
p87
aVand Fortune 100 companies from a wide range of industries
p88
aVare now getting behind it.
p89
aVSo by now you're probably wondering,
p90
aVwhat exactly is this plan?
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars.
p93
aVThe first is a gradually rising carbon tax.
p94
aVAlthough capitalism is a wonderful system,
p95
aVlike many operating systems, it's prone to bugs,
p96
aVwhich, in this case, are called "market failures."
p97
aVBy far the largest is that market prices fail to take
p98
aVsocial and environmental costs into account.
p99
aVThat means every market transaction is based on incorrect information.
p100
aVThis fundamental bug of capitalism, more than any other single factor,
p101
aVis to blame for our climate predicament.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow in theory, this should be an easy problem to fix.
p104
aVEconomists agree
p105
aVthat the best solution is to put a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels,
p106
aVotherwise known as a carbon tax.
p107
aVThis would discourage carbon emissions
p108
aVin every single economic transaction,
p109
aVevery day of the year.
p110
aVHowever, a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular
p111
aVand a political dead end.
p112
aVThe answer is to return all the money raised
p113
aVdirectly to citizens,
p114
aVin the form of equal monthly dividends.
p115
aVThis would transform an unpopular carbon tax
p116
aVinto a popular and populist solution,
p117
aVand it would also solve
p118
aVthe underlying psychological barrier that we discussed,
p119
aVby giving everyone a concrete benefit in the here and now.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd these benefits would be significant.
p122
aVAssuming a carbon tax rate that starts at 40 dollars per ton,
p123
aVa family of four would receive 2,000 dollars per year
p124
aVfrom the get-go.
p125
aVAccording to the US Treasury Department,
p126
aVthe bottom 70 percent of Americans would receive more in dividends
p127
aVthan they would pay in increased energy prices.
p128
aVThat means 223 million Americans would win economically
p129
aVfrom solving climate change.
p130
aVAnd that \u2014
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
Vis revolutionary,
p135
aVand could fundamentally alter climate politics.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut there's another revolutionary element here.
p138
aVThe amount of the dividend would grow
p139
aVas the carbon tax rate increases.
p140
aVThe more we protect our climate,
p141
aVthe more our citizens benefit.
p142
aVThis creates a positive feedback loop,
p143
aVwhich is crucial,
p144
aVbecause the only way we will reach our long-term emission-reduction goals
p145
aVis if the carbon tax rate goes up every year.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations
p148
aVthat are no longer needed
p149
aVonce a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
p150
aVThis is a key selling point to Republicans and business leaders.
p151
aVSo why should we trade
p152
aVclimate regulations for a price on carbon?
p153
aVWell, let me show you.
p154
aVOur plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions
p155
aVof all Obama-era climate regulations combined,
p156
aVand nearly three times the new baseline
p157
aVafter President Trump repeals all of those regulations.
p158
aVThat assumes a carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton,
p159
aVwhich translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
p160
aVOur plan by itself
p161
aVwould meet the high end of America's commitment
p162
aVunder the Paris Climate Agreement,
p163
aVand as you can see,
p164
aVthe emissions reductions would continue over time.
p165
aVThis illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution
p166
aVbased on free markets and limited government.
p167
aVWe would end up with less regulation
p168
aVand far less pollution at the same time,
p169
aVwhile helping working-class Americans get ahead.
p170
aVDoesn't that sound like something we could all support?
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VThe fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate domino effect,
p175
aVbased on border carbon adjustments.
p176
aVNow that may sound complicated,
p177
aVbut it, too, is revolutionary,
p178
aVbecause it provides us a whole new strategy
p179
aVto reach a global price on carbon,
p180
aVwhich is ultimately what we need.
p181
aVLet me show you an example.
p182
aVSuppose Country A adopts a carbon dividends plan,
p183
aVand Country B does not.
p184
aVWell, to level the playing field
p185
aVand protect the competitiveness of its industries,
p186
aVCountry A would tax imports from Country B
p187
aVbased on their carbon content.
p188
aVFair enough.
p189
aVBut here's where it gets really interesting,
p190
aVbecause the money raised at the border would increase the dividends
p191
aVgoing to the citizens of Country A.
p192
aVWell, how long do you think it would take the public in Country B to realize
p193
aVthat that money should be going to them,
p194
aVand to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land?
p195
aVAdd a few more countries,
p196
aVand we get a new climate domino effect.
p197
aa(lp198
VOnce one major country or region adopts carbon dividends
p199
aVwith border carbon adjustments,
p200
aVother countries are compelled to follow suit.
p201
aVOne by one the dominoes fall.
p202
aVAnd this domino effect could start anywhere.
p203
aVMy preference, strongly, is the United States,
p204
aVbut it could also start in the United Kingdom,
p205
aVin Germany or another European country,
p206
aVor even in China.
p207
aa(lp208
VLet's take China as an example.
p209
aVChina is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
p210
aVbut what its leaders care even more about
p211
aVis transitioning their economy to consumer-led economic development.
p212
aVWell, nothing could do more to hasten that transition
p213
aVthan giving every Chinese citizen a monthly dividend.
p214
aVIn fact, this is the only policy solution
p215
aVthat would enable China to meet its environmental and economic goals
p216
aVat the same time.
p217
aa(lp218
VThat's why this is the killer app of climate policy,
p219
aVbecause it would enable us to overcome
p220
aVeach of the barriers we discussed earlier:
p221
aVthe psychological barrier, the partisan barrier,
p222
aVand, as we've just seen, the geopolitical barrier.
p223
aVAll we need is a country to lead the way.
p224
aVAnd one method of finding what you're looking for
p225
aVis to take out an ad.
p226
aVSo let's read this one together.
p227
aa(lp228
VWanted: country to pioneer carbon dividends plan.
p229
aVCost to country: zero.
p230
aVStarting date: as soon as possible.
p231
aVAdvantages: most effective climate solution,
p232
aVpopular and populist,
p233
aVpro-growth and pro-business,
p234
aVshrinks government and helps the working class.
p235
aVAdditional compensation: gratitude of current and future generations,
p236
aVincluding my daughter.
p237
aa(lp238
VThank you.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VChris Anderson: Just one question for you, Ted.
p243
aVI'm actually not sure
p244
aVI've seen a conservative get a standing O at TED before that.
p245
aVThat's pretty cool.
p246
aVThe logic seems really powerful,
p247
aVbut some people you talk to in politics
p248
aVsay it's hard to imagine this still getting through Congress.
p249
aVHow are you feeling about momentum behind this?
p250
aa(lp251
VTed Halstead: So I understand that many are very pessimistic
p252
aVabout what's happening in the United States with President Trump.
p253
aVI'm less pessimistic; here's why.
p254
aVThe actions of this White House, the early actions on climate,
p255
aVare just the first move in a complex game of climate chess.
p256
aVSo far it's been a repeal-only strategy;
p257
aVthe pressure is going to mount  for a replacement program,
p258
aVwhich is where we come in.
p259
aVAnd there are three reasons why, which I'll go through real quickly.
p260
aa(lp261
VOne, the business community is fundamentally parting ways
p262
aVwith the White House on climate change.
p263
aVIn fact, we're finding
p264
aVa number of Fortune 100 companies supporting our program.
p265
aVWithin two months, we're going to be announcing
p266
aVsome really surprising names coming out in favor of this program.
p267
aVTwo, there is no issue in American politics
p268
aVwhere there's a more fundamental gap between the Republican base
p269
aVand the Republican leadership than climate change.
p270
aVAnd three, thinking of this analogy of chess,
p271
aVthe big decision up ahead is: Does the administration stay in Paris?
p272
aVWell, let's pan it out both ways.
p273
aVIf it stays in Paris, as many are pushing for in the administration,
p274
aVwell then that begs a question: What's the plan?
p275
aVWe have the plan.
p276
aVBut if they don't stay in Paris,
p277
aVthe international pressure will be overwhelming.
p278
aVOur Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions,
p279
aVand they'll be saying, "No, give us our Paris commitment.
p280
aVCome through on your commitments, we'll come through on ours."
p281
aa(lp282
VSo, international, business and even the Republican base
p283
aVwill all be calling for a Republican replacement plan.
p284
aVAnd, hopefully, we've provided one.
p285
aa(lp286
VCA: Thank you so much, Ted.
p287
aa(lp288
VTH: Thank you, Chris.
