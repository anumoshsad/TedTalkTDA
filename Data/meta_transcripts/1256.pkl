VI moved to Boston 10 years ago from Chicago,
p4
aVwith an interest in cancer and in chemistry.
p5
aVYou might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules
p6
aVor, to my taste,
p7
aVnew drugs for cancer.
p8
aVAnd you might also know that, for science and medicine,
p9
aVBoston is a bit of a candy store.
p10
aVYou can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student.
p11
aVThe bar is called the Miracle of Science.
p12
aVThe billboards say "Lab Space Available."
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd it's fair to say that in these 10 years,
p15
aVwe've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution \u2014
p16
aVthat of genome medicine.
p17
aVWe know more about the patients that enter our clinic now
p18
aVthan ever before.
p19
aVAnd we're able, finally, to answer the question
p20
aVthat's been so pressing for so many years:
p21
aVWhy do I have cancer?
p22
aVThis information is also pretty staggering.
p23
aVYou might know that, so far, in just the dawn of this revolution,
p24
aVwe know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations
p25
aVaffecting more than 10,000 genes,
p26
aVand that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers,
p27
aVcauses of cancer.
p28
aa(lp29
VYet comparatively,
p30
aVwe have about a dozen targeted medications.
p31
aVAnd this inadequacy of cancer medicine
p32
aVreally hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
p33
aVWe didn't fly him to Boston.
p34
aVWe didn't sequence his genome.
p35
aVIt's been known for decades what causes this malignancy.
p36
aVIt's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.
p37
aVThis is old information we've known since about the 80s,
p38
aVyet there's no medicine I can prescribe
p39
aVto a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors
p40
aVcaused by these three ...
p41
aVHorsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.
p42
aVThere's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd you might fairly ask: Why is that?
p45
aVAnd the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is:
p46
aVit's too hard.
p47
aVThat for whatever reason,
p48
aVthese three proteins have entered a space, in the language of our field,
p49
aVthat's called the undruggable genome \u2014
p50
aVwhich is like calling a computer unsurfable
p51
aVor the Moon unwalkable.
p52
aVIt's a horrible term of trade.
p53
aVBut what it means
p54
aVis that we've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins,
p55
aVinto which we, like molecular locksmiths,
p56
aVcan fashion an active, small, organic molecule or drug substance.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, as I was training in clinical medicine
p59
aVand hematology and oncology and stem-cell transplantation,
p60
aVwhat we had instead,
p61
aVcascading through the regulatory network at the FDA,
p62
aVwere these substances:
p63
aVarsenic,
p64
aVthalidomide,
p65
aVand this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas.
p66
aVAnd this is the 21st century.
p67
aVAnd so, I guess you'd say,
p68
aVdissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines,
p69
aVI went back to school, in chemistry,
p70
aVwith the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry
p71
aVand approaching it in the context of this brave new world
p72
aVof the open source,
p73
aVthe crowd source,
p74
aVthe collaborative network that we have access to within academia,
p75
aVthat we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies
p76
aVto our patients.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so, please consider this a work in progress,
p79
aVbut I'd like to tell you today a story
p80
aVabout a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma,
p81
aVabout the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer,
p82
aVcalled BRD4,
p83
aVand about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
p84
aVcalled JQ1,
p85
aVwhich we affectionately named for Jun Qi,
p86
aVthe chemist that made this molecule.
p87
aVNow, BRD4 is an interesting protein.
p88
aa(lp89
VYou might ask: with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,
p90
aVhow does it remember it's cancer?
p91
aVWhen it winds up its genome,
p92
aVdivides into two cells and unwinds again,
p93
aVwhy does it not turn into an eye, into a liver,
p94
aVas it has all the genes necessary to do this?
p95
aVIt remembers that it's cancer.
p96
aVAnd the reason is that cancer, like every cell in the body,
p97
aVplaces little molecular bookmarks,
p98
aVlittle Post-it notes,
p99
aVthat remind the cell, "I'm cancer; I should keep growing."
p100
aVAnd those Post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class \u2014
p101
aVso-called bromodomains.
p102
aVSo we developed an idea, a rationale,
p103
aVthat perhaps if we made a molecule
p104
aVthat prevented the Post-it note from sticking
p105
aVby entering into the little pocket
p106
aVat the base of this spinning protein,
p107
aVthen maybe we could convince cancer cells,
p108
aVcertainly those addicted to this BRD4 protein,
p109
aVthat they're not cancer.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd so we started to work on this problem.
p112
aVWe developed libraries of compounds
p113
aVand eventually arrived at this and similar substances
p114
aVcalled JQ1.
p115
aVNow, not being a drug company,
p116
aVwe could do certain things, we had certain flexibilities,
p117
aVthat I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have.
p118
aVWe just started mailing it to our friends.
p119
aVI have a small lab.
p120
aVWe thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves.
p121
aVWe sent it to Oxford, England,
p122
aVwhere a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture,
p123
aVwhich helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent
p124
aVfor this protein target.
p125
aVIt's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity,
p126
aVor hand in glove.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, this is a very rare cancer,
p129
aVthis BRD4-addicted cancer.
p130
aVAnd so we worked with samples of material
p131
aVthat were collected by young pathologists at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
p132
aVAnd as we treated these cells with this molecule,
p133
aVwe observed something really striking.
p134
aVThe cancer cells \u2014
p135
aVsmall, round and rapidly dividing,
p136
aVgrew these arms and extensions.
p137
aVThey were changing shape.
p138
aVIn effect,
p139
aVthe cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer
p140
aVand becoming a normal cell.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis got us very excited.
p143
aVThe next step would be to put this molecule into mice.
p144
aVThe only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer.
p145
aVAnd so at the time we were doing this research,
p146
aVI was caring for a 29-year-old firefighter from Connecticut
p147
aVwho was very much at the end of life
p148
aVwith this incurable cancer.
p149
aVThis BRD4-addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung.
p150
aVAnd he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris.
p151
aVAnd every nursing shift, we would throw this material out.
p152
aVAnd so we approached this patient
p153
aVand asked if he would collaborate with us.
p154
aVCould we take this precious and rare cancerous material
p155
aVfrom this chest tube
p156
aVand drive it across town and put it into mice
p157
aVand try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug,
p158
aVwell, that would be, of course, impossible
p159
aVand, rightly, illegal to do in humans.
p160
aVAnd he obliged us.
p161
aVAt the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging,
p162
aVour colleague, Andrew Kung, grew this cancer successfully in mice
p163
aVwithout ever touching plastic.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd you can see this PET scan of a mouse \u2014 what we call a pet PET.
p166
aVThe cancer is growing
p167
aVas this red, huge mass in the hind limb of this animal.
p168
aVAnd as we treat it with our compound,
p169
aVthis addiction to sugar,
p170
aVthis rapid growth, faded.
p171
aVAnd on the animal on the right,
p172
aVyou see that the cancer was responding.
p173
aVWe've completed, now, clinical trials
p174
aVin four mouse models of this disease.
p175
aVAnd every time, we see the same thing.
p176
aVThe mice with this cancer that get the drug live,
p177
aVand the ones that don't rapidly perish.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we started to wonder,
p180
aVwhat would a drug company do at this point?
p181
aVWell, they probably would keep this a secret
p182
aVuntil they turn the prototype drug
p183
aVinto an active pharmaceutical substance.
p184
aVSo we did just the opposite.
p185
aVWe published a paper that described this finding
p186
aVat the earliest prototype stage.
p187
aVWe gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule,
p188
aVtypically a secret in our discipline.
p189
aVWe told people exactly how to make it.
p190
aVWe gave them our email address,
p191
aVsuggesting that if they write us,
p192
aVwe'll send them a free molecule.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VWe basically tried to create the most competitive environment
p197
aVfor our lab as possible.
p198
aVAnd this was, unfortunately, successful.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VBecause now, we've shared this molecule,
p203
aVjust since December of last year,
p204
aVwith 40 laboratories in the United States
p205
aVand 30 more in Europe \u2014
p206
aVmany of them pharmaceutical companies,
p207
aVseeking now to enter this space,
p208
aVto target this rare cancer that, thankfully right now,
p209
aVis quite desirable to study in that industry.
p210
aVBut the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories
p211
aVabout the use of this molecule
p212
aVhas provided us insights we might not have had on our own.
p213
aVLeukemia cells treated with this compound
p214
aVturn into normal white blood cells.
p215
aVMice with multiple myeloma,
p216
aVan incurable malignancy of the bone marrow,
p217
aVrespond dramatically
p218
aVto the treatment with this drug.
p219
aVYou might know that fat has memory.
p220
aVI'll nicely demonstrate that for you.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VIn fact, this molecule
p225
aVprevents this adipocyte, this fat stem cell,
p226
aVfrom remembering how to make fat,
p227
aVsuch that mice on a high-fat diet,
p228
aVlike the folks in my hometown of Chicago \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
Vfail to develop fatty liver,
p233
aVwhich is a major medical problem.
p234
aa(lp235
VWhat this research taught us \u2014
p236
aVnot just my lab, but our institute,
p237
aVand Harvard Medical School more generally \u2014
p238
aVis that we have unique resources in academia
p239
aVfor drug discovery;
p240
aVthat our center, which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules
p241
aVin a scientific way
p242
aVthan any other,
p243
aVnever made one of its own.
p244
aVFor all the reasons you see listed here,
p245
aVwe think there's a great opportunity for academic centers
p246
aVto participate in this earliest, conceptually tricky
p247
aVand creative discipline
p248
aVof prototype drug discovery.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo what next?
p251
aVWe have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
p252
aVIt's not orally bioavailable.
p253
aVWe need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients.
p254
aVAnd everyone in the lab,
p255
aVespecially following the interaction with these patients,
p256
aVfeels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance
p257
aVbased on this molecule.
p258
aVIt's here where I'd say
p259
aVthat we could use your help and your insights,
p260
aVyour collaborative participation.
p261
aVUnlike a drug company, we don't have a pipeline
p262
aVthat we can deposit these molecules into.
p263
aVWe don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers
p264
aVto tell us how to position this drug against the other.
p265
aVWhat we do have is the flexibility of an academic center
p266
aVto work with competent, motivated,
p267
aVenthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people
p268
aVto carry these molecules forward into the clinic
p269
aVwhile preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide.
p270
aa(lp271
VThis molecule will soon leave our benches
p272
aVand go into a small start-up company called Tensha Therapeutics.
p273
aVAnd, really, this is the fourth of these molecules
p274
aVto kind of "graduate" from our little pipeline
p275
aVof drug discovery,
p276
aVtwo of which \u2014 a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin
p277
aVand an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma \u2014
p278
aVwill actually come to the bedside for the first clinical trial
p279
aVin July of this year \u2014 for us, a major and exciting milestone.
p280
aVI want to leave you with just two ideas.
p281
aVThe first is: if anything is unique about this research,
p282
aVit's less the science than the strategy.
p283
aVThis, for us, was a social experiment \u2014
p284
aVan experiment in "What would happen if we were as open and honest
p285
aVat the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research
p286
aVas we could be?"
p287
aa(lp288
VThis string of letters and numbers
p289
aVand symbols and parentheses
p290
aVthat can be texted, I suppose,
p291
aVor Twittered worldwide,
p292
aVis the chemical identity of our pro compound.
p293
aVIt's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies,
p294
aVthe information on how these early prototype drugs might work.
p295
aVYet this information is largely a secret.
p296
aVAnd so we seek, really, to download
p297
aVfrom the amazing successes of the computer-science industry,
p298
aVtwo principles \u2014 that of open source and that of crowdsourcing \u2014
p299
aVto quickly, responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics
p300
aVto patients with cancer.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, the business model involves all of you.
p303
aVThis research is funded by the public.
p304
aVIt's funded by foundations.
p305
aVAnd one thing I've learned in Boston
p306
aVis that you people will do anything for cancer, and I love that.
p307
aVYou bike across the state, you walk up and down the river.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VI've never seen, really, anywhere,
p312
aVthis unique support for cancer research.
p313
aVAnd so I want to thank you
p314
aVfor your participation, your collaboration
p315
aVand most of all,
p316
aVfor your confidence in our ideas.
