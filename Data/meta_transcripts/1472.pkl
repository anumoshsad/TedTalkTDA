VI always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement:
p4
aVto resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations,
p5
aVin the act of being with them.
p6
aVAs a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance,
p7
aVthat sense of the other that happens so quickly,
p8
aVin the blink of an eye.
p9
aVWe intuit other people's feelings;
p10
aVwe know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
p11
aVWe're always in this stance
p12
aVof being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.
p13
aVWe do that all the time. We just can't shake it off.
p14
aVIt's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves,
p15
aVto understand the world around us,
p16
aVare shaped by that stance.
p17
aVWe are social to the core.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo my journey in autism really started
p20
aVwhen I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
p21
aVMost of those individuals had spent most of their lives
p22
aVin long-stay hospitals.
p23
aVThis is a long time ago.
p24
aVAnd for them, autism was devastating.
p25
aVThey had profound intellectual disabilities.
p26
aVThey didn't talk.
p27
aVBut most of all,
p28
aVthey were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them,
p29
aVfrom their environment
p30
aVand from the people.
p31
aVIn fact, at the time, if you walked into a school
p32
aVfor individuals with autism,
p33
aVyou'd hear a lot of noise,
p34
aVplenty of commotion, actions, people doing things.
p35
aVBut they're always doing things by themselves.
p36
aVSo they may be looking at a light in the ceiling,
p37
aVor they may be isolated in the corner,
p38
aVor they might be engaged in these repetitive movements,
p39
aVin self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.
p40
aVExtremely, extremely isolated.
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, now we know that autism is this disruption,
p43
aVthe disruption of this resonance that I am telling you about.
p44
aVThese are survival skills.
p45
aVThese are survival skills that we inherited
p46
aVover many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
p47
aa(lp48
VYou see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.
p49
aVWithout the caregiver, they wouldn't survive,
p50
aVso it stands to reason that nature would endow them
p51
aVwith these mechanisms of survival.
p52
aVThey orient to the caregiver.
p53
aVFrom the first days and weeks of life,
p54
aVbabies prefer to hear human sounds,
p55
aVrather than just sounds in the environment.
p56
aVThey prefer to look at people rather than at things,
p57
aVand even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes,
p58
aVbecause the eye is the window to the other person's experiences,
p59
aVso much so that they even prefer to look at people
p60
aVwho are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.
p61
aVWell, they orient to the caregiver.
p62
aVThe caregiver seeks the baby.
p63
aVAnd it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography
p64
aVthat a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind \u2014
p65
aVthe social mind, the social brain \u2014 depends on.
p66
aa(lp67
VWe always think about autism
p68
aVas something that happens later on in life.
p69
aVIt doesn't; it begins with the beginning of life.
p70
aVAs babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well,
p71
aVthere is something between the ears that is very important \u2014
p72
aVit's invisible, you can't see it, but it's really critical.
p73
aVAnd that thing is called attention.
p74
aVAnd they learn soon enough,
p75
aVeven before they can utter one word,
p76
aVthat they can take that attention and move somewhere
p77
aVin order to get things they want.
p78
aVThey also learn to follow other people's gazes,
p79
aVbecause whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.
p80
aVAnd soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things,
p81
aVbecause when somebody is looking at something
p82
aVor somebody is pointing at something,
p83
aVthey're not just getting a directional cue.
p84
aVThey are getting the other person's meaning of that thing,
p85
aVthe attitude.
p86
aVAnd soon enough, they start building this body of meanings,
p87
aVbut meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.
p88
aVThose are meanings that are acquired
p89
aVas part of their shared experiences with others.
p90
aa(lp91
VWell, this is a 15-month-old little girl,
p92
aVand she has autism.
p93
aVAnd I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face,
p94
aVand she's quite oblivious to me.
p95
aVImagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face.
p96
aVYou'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?
p97
aVYou would recoil. You would call the police.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VYou would do something,
p102
aVbecause it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space
p103
aVand not get that reaction.
p104
aVWe do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.
p105
aVThis is our body wisdom;
p106
aVit's not something mediated by our language.
p107
aVOur body just knows that.
p108
aVAnd we've known that for a long time.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd this is not something that happens to humans only.
p111
aVIt happens to some of our phyletic cousins,
p112
aVbecause if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey,
p113
aVand that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you,
p114
aVand that is considered to be a signal or threat,
p115
aVwell, you are not going to be alive for long.
p116
aVSo something that in other species are survival mechanisms,
p117
aVwithout which they wouldn't basically live,
p118
aVwe bring into the context of human beings,
p119
aVand this is what we need to simply act, socially.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her,
p122
aVand you think, maybe she can see you,
p123
aVmaybe she can hear you.
p124
aVWell, a few minutes later,
p125
aVshe goes to the corner of the room,
p126
aVand she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&M.
p127
aVSo I could not attract her attention,
p128
aVbut something \u2014 a thing \u2014 did.
p129
aVNow, most of us make a big dichotomy
p130
aVbetween the world of things and the world of people.
p131
aVNow, for this girl, that division line is not so clear,
p132
aVand the world of people is not attracting her
p133
aVas much as we would like.
p134
aVNow, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.
p135
aVWhat she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging,
p136
aVmoment by moment,
p137
aVas she is isolating herself further and further.
p138
aVSo we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic,
p139
aVthe brain determines who we're going to be.
p140
aVBut, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are,
p141
aVand at the same time that her behaviors are taking away
p142
aVfrom the realm of social interaction,
p143
aVthis is what's happening with her mind,
p144
aVand this is what's happening with her brain.
p145
aa(lp146
VWell, autism is the most strongly genetic condition
p147
aVof all developmental disorders.
p148
aVAnd it's a brain disorder.
p149
aVIt's a disorder that begins much prior to the time
p150
aVthat the child is born.
p151
aVWe now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
p152
aVThere are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled
p153
aVbut there are those that are gifted.
p154
aVThere are those individuals who don't talk at all;
p155
aVthere are those individuals who talk too much.
p156
aVThere are those individuals that if you observe them in their school,
p157
aVyou see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them,
p158
aVto those individuals who cannot stop coming to you
p159
aVand trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly,
p160
aVbut often in an awkward fashion,
p161
aVwithout that immediate resonance.
p162
aa(lp163
VWell, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.
p164
aVWhen I started in this field,
p165
aVwe thought there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 \u2014
p166
aVa very rare condition.
p167
aVWell, now we know it's more like one in 100.
p168
aVThere are millions of individuals with autism all around us.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe societal cost of this condition is huge,
p171
aVin the US alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.
p172
aVAnd you know what?
p173
aVMost of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults
p174
aVwho are severely disabled,
p175
aVindividuals who need wraparound services \u2014
p176
aVservices that are very, very intensive.
p177
aVAnd those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.
p178
aVThose are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment,
p179
aVbecause now we know that autism creates itself
p180
aVas individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.
p181
aVWere we to be able to identify this condition
p182
aVat an earlier point, and intervene and treat \u2014
p183
aVI can tell you, this has been probably something that has changed my life
p184
aVin the past 10 years,
p185
aVthis notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.
p186
aVAlso, we have a window of opportunity,
p187
aVbecause the brain is malleable for just so long,
p188
aVand that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.
p189
aVIt's not that that window closes; it doesn't.
p190
aVBut it diminishes considerably.
p191
aVAnd yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country
p192
aVis still about five years,
p193
aVand in disadvantaged populations,
p194
aVthe populations that don't have access to clinical services,
p195
aVrural populations, minorities,
p196
aVthe age of diagnosis is later still,
p197
aVwhich is almost as if I were to tell you
p198
aVthat we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism
p199
aVwhose condition is going to be more severe.
p200
aVSo I feel that we have a bioethical imperative.
p201
aVThe science is there.
p202
aVBut no science is of relevance
p203
aVif it doesn't have an impact on the community.
p204
aVAnd we just can't afford that missed opportunity,
p205
aVbecause children with autism become adults with autism.
p206
aVAnd we feel that those things we can do
p207
aVfor these children, for those families, early on,
p208
aVwill have lifetime consequences \u2014
p209
aVfor the child, for the family, and for the community at large.
p210
aVSo this is our view of autism.
p211
aa(lp212
VThere are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism.
p213
aVIn fact, we believe there are going to be
p214
aVsomething between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism,
p215
aVand genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.
p216
aVAnd we actually have a bit of a question here,
p217
aVbecause if there are so many different causes of autism,
p218
aVhow do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?
p219
aVBecause people like myself,
p220
aVwhen we walk into a playroom,
p221
aVwe recognize a child as having autism.
p222
aVSo how do you go from multiple causes
p223
aVto a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
p224
aVAnd the answer is what lies in between,
p225
aVwhich is development.
p226
aVAnd in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life,
p227
aVbecause those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.
p228
aVAutism creates itself.
p229
aVWere we to be able to intervene during those years of life,
p230
aVwe might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo how do we do that?
p233
aVHow do we enter that feeling of resonance,
p234
aVhow do we enter another person's being?
p235
aVI remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old,
p236
aVthe thing that came to my mind was,
p237
aV"How do you come into her world?
p238
aVIs she thinking about me? Is she thinking about others?"
p239
aVWell, it's hard to do that,
p240
aVso we had to create the technologies.
p241
aVWe had to basically step inside a body.
p242
aVWe had to see the world through her eyes.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd so in the past many years,
p245
aVwe've been building these new technologies
p246
aVthat are based on eye tracking.
p247
aVWe can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with.
p248
aVThis is my colleague, Warren Jones,
p249
aVwith whom we've been building these methods, these studies,
p250
aVfor the past 12 years.
p251
aVAnd you see there a happy five-month-old,
p252
aVa five-month little boy who is going to watch things
p253
aVthat are brought from his world:
p254
aVhis mom, the caregiver,
p255
aVbut also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
p256
aVWhat we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory,
p257
aVbut in order for us to do that,
p258
aVwe had to create these very sophisticated measures,
p259
aVmeasures of how people, how little babies,
p260
aVhow newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment.
p261
aVWhat is important and what is not.
p262
aa(lp263
VWell, we created those measures,
p264
aVand here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.
p265
aVYou're watching a video \u2014
p266
aVthose frames are separated by about a second \u2014
p267
aVthrough the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.
p268
aVAnd we freeze one frame,
p269
aVand this is what the typical children are doing.
p270
aVIn this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.
p271
aVSo on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this,
p272
aVthe emotion of expression of that little boy
p273
aVas he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.
p274
aVWhat are the children with autism doing?
p275
aVThey are focusing on the revolving door,
p276
aVopening and shutting.
p277
aVWell, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here
p278
aVdoesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
p279
aVIt happens moment by moment in their real lives,
p280
aVand their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized
p281
aVin something other than what is happening with their typical peers.
p282
aa(lp283
VWell, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends,
p284
aVthe concept of growth charts \u2014
p285
aVyou know, when you take a child to the pediatrician,
p286
aVand you have physical height and weight.
p287
aVWell, we decided we were going to create growth charts
p288
aVof social engagement.
p289
aVWe sought children from the time they're born.
p290
aVWhat you see here on the x-axis
p291
aVis two, three, four, five, six months and nine,
p292
aVuntil about the age of 24 months.
p293
aVThis is the percent of their viewing time
p294
aVthat they're focusing on people's eyes,
p295
aVand this is their growth chart.
p296
aVThey start over here \u2014 they love people's eyes \u2014
p297
aVand it remains quite stable.
p298
aVIt sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
p299
aVNow, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.
p300
aVIt's something very different.
p301
aVIt starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.
p302
aVIt's very much like they brought into this world the reflex
p303
aVthat orients them to people, but it has no traction.
p304
aVIt's almost as if that stimulus \u2014 you \u2014
p305
aVyou're not exerting influence on what happens
p306
aVas they navigate their daily lives.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, we thought those data were so powerful, in a way,
p309
aVthat we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life,
p310
aVbecause if you interact with a two- and a three-month-old,
p311
aVyou'd be surprised by how social those babies are.
p312
aVAnd what we see in the first six months of life
p313
aVis that those two groups can be segregated very easily.
p314
aVAnd using these kinds of measures and many others,
p315
aVwhat we found out is that our science could, in fact,
p316
aVidentify this condition early on.
p317
aVWe didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism
p318
aVto emerge in the second year of life.
p319
aVIf we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved,
p320
aVand developmentally very early-emerging \u2014
p321
aVthings that are online from the first weeks of life \u2014
p322
aVwe could push the detection of autism
p323
aVall the way to those first months,
p324
aVand that's what we are doing now.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow, we can create the very best technologies
p327
aVand the very best methods to identify the children,
p328
aVbut this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact
p329
aVon what happens in their reality in the community.
p330
aVNow we want those devices, of course,
p331
aVto be deployed by those who are in the trenches \u2014
p332
aVour colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child \u2014
p333
aVand we need to transform those technologies
p334
aVinto something that is going to add value to their practice,
p335
aVbecause they have to see so many children.
p336
aVAnd we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child.
p337
aVBut this would be immoral
p338
aVif we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.
p339
aVWe need to be able to work with the families, support the families,
p340
aVto manage those first years with them.
p341
aVWe need to be able to really go
p342
aVfrom universal screening to universal access to treatment,
p343
aVbecause those treatments are going to change
p344
aVthese children's and those families' lives.
p345
aa(lp346
VNow, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years,
p347
aVI can tell you, having been in this field for so long,
p348
aVone feels really rejuvenated.
p349
aVThere is a sense that the science that one worked on
p350
aVcan actually have an impact on realities,
p351
aVpreventing, in fact, those experiences
p352
aVthat I really started in my journey in this field.
p353
aVI thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.
p354
aVNo longer. We can do a great deal of things.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd the idea is not to cure autism.
p357
aVThat's not the idea.
p358
aVWhat we want is to make sure
p359
aVthat those individuals with autism can be free
p360
aVfrom the devastating consequences that come with it at times,
p361
aVthe profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language,
p362
aVthe profound, profound isolation.
p363
aVWe feel that individuals with autism, in fact,
p364
aVhave a very special perspective on the world,
p365
aVand we need diversity.
p366
aVAnd they can work extremely well in some areas of strength:
p367
aVpredictable situations, situations that can be defined.
p368
aVBecause after all, they learn about the world
p369
aValmost, like, about it,
p370
aVrather than learning how to function in it.
p371
aVBut this is a strength if you're working, for example, in technology.
p372
aVAnd there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.
p373
aVWe want them to be free to do that.
p374
aVWe want that the next generations of individuals with autism
p375
aVwill be able not only to express their strengths,
p376
aVbut to fulfill their promise.
p377
aa(lp378
