VRadical openness is still a distant future
p4
aVin the field of school education.
p5
aVWe have such a hard time figuring out
p6
aVthat learning is not a place but an activity.
p7
aa(lp8
VBut I want to tell you the story of PISA,
p9
aVOECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills
p10
aVof 15-year-olds around the world,
p11
aVand it's really a story of how international comparisons
p12
aVhave globalized the field of education that we usually treat
p13
aVas an affair of domestic policy.
p14
aa(lp15
VLook at how the world looked in the 1960s,
p16
aVin terms of the proportion of people
p17
aVwho had completed high school.
p18
aVYou can see the United States ahead of everyone else,
p19
aVand much of the economic success of the United States
p20
aVdraws on its long-standing advantage
p21
aVas the first mover in education.
p22
aVBut in the 1970s, some countries caught up.
p23
aVIn the 1980s, the global expansion
p24
aVof the talent pool continued.
p25
aVAnd the world didn't stop in the 1990s.
p26
aVSo in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
p27
aVIn the '90s, it was 13th,
p28
aVand not because standards had fallen,
p29
aVbut because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.
p30
aa(lp31
VKorea shows you what's possible in education.
p32
aVTwo generations ago, Korea had the standard of living
p33
aVof Afghanistan today,
p34
aVand was one of the lowest education performers.
p35
aVToday, every young Korean finishes high school.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo this tells us that, in a global economy,
p38
aVit is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,
p39
aVbut the best performing education systems internationally.
p40
aVThe trouble is that
p41
aVmeasuring how much time people spend in school
p42
aVor what degree they have got is not always
p43
aVa good way of seeing what they can actually do.
p44
aVLook at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,
p45
aVwhile employers say they cannot find the people
p46
aVwith the skills they need.
p47
aVAnd that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate
p48
aVinto better skills and better jobs and better lives.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo with PISA, we try to change this
p51
aVby measuring the knowledge and skills
p52
aVof people directly.
p53
aVAnd we took a very special angle to this.
p54
aVWe were less interested in whether students can simply
p55
aVreproduce what they have learned in school,
p56
aVbut we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate
p57
aVfrom what they know
p58
aVand apply their knowledge in novel situations.
p59
aVNow, some people have criticized us for this.
p60
aVThey say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes
p61
aVis terribly unfair to people, because we test students
p62
aVwith problems they haven't seen before.
p63
aVBut if you take that logic, you know,
p64
aVyou should consider life unfair, because
p65
aVthe test of truth in life is not whether we can remember
p66
aVwhat we learned in school,
p67
aVbut whether we are prepared for change,
p68
aVwhether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,
p69
aVto use technologies that haven't been invented,
p70
aVto solve problems we just can't anticipate today.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd once hotly contested,
p73
aVour way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
p74
aVIn our latest assessment in 2009,
p75
aVwe measured 74 school systems
p76
aVthat together cover 87 percent of the economy.
p77
aVThis chart shows you the performance of countries.
p78
aVIn red, sort of below OECD average.
p79
aVYellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.
p80
aVYou can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;
p81
aVFinland in Europe;
p82
aVCanada in North America doing really well.
p83
aVYou can also see that there is a gap of almost
p84
aVthree and a half school years between
p85
aV15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile,
p86
aVand the gap grows to seven school years
p87
aVwhen you include the countries with really poor performance.
p88
aVThere's a world of difference in the way in which
p89
aVyoung people are prepared for today's economy.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut I want to introduce a second important dimension
p92
aVinto this picture.
p93
aVEducators like to talk about equity.
p94
aVWith PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,
p95
aVin terms of ensuring that people
p96
aVfrom different social backgrounds have equal chances.
p97
aVAnd we see that in some countries, the impact
p98
aVof social background on learning outcomes
p99
aVis very, very strong.
p100
aVOpportunities are unequally distributed.
p101
aVA lot of potential of young children is wasted.
p102
aVWe see in other countries that it matters much less
p103
aVinto which social context you're born.
p104
aVWe all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,
p105
aVwhere performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
p106
aVNobody, and no country, can afford to be there,
p107
aVwhere performance is poor
p108
aVand there are large social disparities.
p109
aVAnd then we can debate, you know, is it better
p110
aVto be there, where performance is strong
p111
aVat the price of large disparities?
p112
aVOr do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?
p113
aVBut actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,
p114
aVyou see there are a lot of countries that actually
p115
aVare combining excellence with equity.
p116
aVIn fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison
p117
aVis that you don't have to compromise equity
p118
aVto achieve excellence.
p119
aVThese countries have moved on from providing excellence
p120
aVfor just some to providing excellence for all,
p121
aVa very important lesson.
p122
aVAnd that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems
p123
aVthat believe they are mainly there to sort people.
p124
aVAnd ever since those results came out, policymakers,
p125
aVeducators, researchers from around the world
p126
aVhave tried to figure out
p127
aVwhat's behind the success of those systems.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut let's step back for a moment
p130
aVand focus on the countries that actually started PISA,
p131
aVand I'm giving them a colored bubble now.
p132
aVAnd I'm making the size of the bubble
p133
aVproportional
p134
aVto the amount of money that countries spent on students.
p135
aVIf money would tell you everything
p136
aVabout the quality of learning outcomes,
p137
aVyou would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?
p138
aVBut that's not what you see.
p139
aVSpending per student only explains about,
p140
aVwell, less than 20 percent
p141
aVof the performance variation among countries,
p142
aVand Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,
p143
aVdoesn't do particularly well.
p144
aVWhat you see is that two countries with similar spending
p145
aVachieve very different results.
p146
aVYou also see \u2014 and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings \u2014
p147
aVthat we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided
p148
aVbetween rich and well-educated countries,
p149
aVand poor and badly-educated ones,
p150
aVa very, very important lesson.
p151
aa(lp152
VLet's look at this in greater detail.
p153
aVThe red dot shows you
p154
aVspending per student relative to a country's wealth.
p155
aVOne way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,
p156
aVand you can see Korea investing a lot
p157
aVin attracting the best people into the teaching profession.
p158
aVAnd Korea also invests into long school days,
p159
aVwhich drives up costs further.
p160
aVLast but not least, Koreans want their teachers
p161
aVnot only to teach but also to develop.
p162
aVThey invest in professional development and collaboration
p163
aVand many other things.
p164
aVAll that costs money.
p165
aVHow can Korea afford all of this?
p166
aVThe answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
p167
aVThis is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
p168
aVYou go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,
p169
aVand you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,
p170
aVso Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.
p171
aVBut, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers
p172
aVin Luxembourg all like small classes.
p173
aVYou know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.
p174
aVSo they have invested all their money into there,
p175
aVand the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.
p176
aVBut even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,
p177
aVand the price for this is that
p178
aVteachers are not paid particularly well.
p179
aVStudents don't have long hours of learning.
p180
aVAnd basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.
p181
aVSo you can see two countries spent their money very differently,
p182
aVand actually how they spent their money
p183
aVmatters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
p184
aa(lp185
VLet's go back to the year 2000.
p186
aVRemember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.
p187
aVThis is how the world looked then
p188
aVin terms of PISA performance.
p189
aVThe first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
p190
aVWe spent a lot less on education,
p191
aVabout 35 percent less on education.
p192
aVSo you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,
p193
aVhas it become so much better?
p194
aVAnd the bitter truth really is that, you know,
p195
aVnot in many countries.
p196
aVBut there are some countries which have seen
p197
aVimpressive improvements.
p198
aVGermany, my own country, in the year 2000,
p199
aVfeatured in the lower quadrant,
p200
aVbelow average performance, large social disparities.
p201
aVAnd remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries
p202
aVthat comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.
p203
aVVery disappointing results.
p204
aVPeople were stunned by the results.
p205
aVAnd for the very first time, the public debate in Germany
p206
aVwas dominated for months by education,
p207
aVnot tax, not other kinds of issues, but education
p208
aVwas the center of the public debate.
p209
aVAnd then policymakers began to respond to this.
p210
aVThe federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.
p211
aVA lot was done to increase the life chances of students
p212
aVwith an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
p213
aVAnd what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about
p214
aVoptimizing existing policies,
p215
aVbut data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms
p216
aVunderlying German education.
p217
aVFor example, traditionally, the education of the very young children
p218
aVwas seen as the business of families, and you would have cases
p219
aVwhere women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities
p220
aVwhen they sent their children to kindergarten.
p221
aVPISA has transformed that debate,
p222
aVand pushed early childhood education right at the center
p223
aVof public policy in Germany.
p224
aVOr traditionally, the German education divides children
p225
aVat the age of 10, very young children,
p226
aVbetween those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers
p227
aVand those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,
p228
aVand that mainly along socioeconomic lines,
p229
aVand that paradigm is being challenged now too.
p230
aVA lot of change.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd the good news is, nine years later,
p233
aVyou can see improvements in quality and equity.
p234
aVPeople have taken up the challenge, done something about it.
p235
aa(lp236
VOr take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.
p237
aVIn the year 2000, Korea did already very well,
p238
aVbut the Koreans were concerned that only a small share
p239
aVof their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.
p240
aVThey took up the challenge,
p241
aVand Korea was able to double the proportion of students
p242
aVachieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.
p243
aVWell, if you only focus on your brightest students,
p244
aVyou know what happens is disparities grow,
p245
aVand you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,
p246
aVbut still, an impressive improvement.
p247
aa(lp248
VA major overhaul of Poland's education
p249
aVhelped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,
p250
aVturn around many of the lowest-performing schools,
p251
aVand raise performance by over half a school year.
p252
aVAnd you can see other countries as well.
p253
aVPortugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,
p254
aVraise quality and improve equity,
p255
aVand so did Hungary.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.
p258
aVAnd even those people who complain and say that
p259
aVthe relative standing of countries
p260
aVon something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,
p261
aVof economic factors, of social issues,
p262
aVof homogeneity of societies, and so on,
p263
aVthese people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
p264
aVYou know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.
p265
aVIt didn't change its economy. It didn't change
p266
aVthe compositions of its population.
p267
aVIt didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies
p268
aVand practice. Very impressive.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn
p271
aVfrom those countries in the green quadrant
p272
aVwho have achieved high levels of equity,
p273
aVhigh levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
p274
aVAnd, of course, the question is, can what works in one context
p275
aVprovide a model elsewhere?
p276
aVOf course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,
p277
aVbut these comparisons have identified a range of factors
p278
aVthat high-performing systems share.
p279
aVEverybody agrees that education is important.
p280
aVEverybody says that.
p281
aVBut the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority
p282
aVagainst other priorities?
p283
aVHow do countries pay their teachers
p284
aVrelative to other highly skilled workers?
p285
aVWould you want your child to become a teacher
p286
aVrather than a lawyer?
p287
aVHow do the media talk about schools and teachers?
p288
aVThose are the critical questions, and what we have learned
p289
aVfrom PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,
p290
aVthe leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices
p291
aVthat value education, their future,
p292
aVmore than consumption today.
p293
aVAnd you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,
p294
aVbut there are countries in which the most attractive place
p295
aVto be is not the shopping center but the school.
p296
aVThose things really exist.
p297
aa(lp298
VBut placing a high value on education
p299
aVis just part of the picture.
p300
aVThe other part is the belief that all children
p301
aVare capable of success.
p302
aVYou have some countries where students
p303
aVare segregated early in their ages.
p304
aVYou know, students are divided up,
p305
aVreflecting the belief that only some children
p306
aVcan achieve world-class standards.
p307
aVBut usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
p308
aVIf you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,
p309
aVparents and teachers in those countries
p310
aVexpect every student to succeed,
p311
aVand you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.
p312
aVWhen we asked students what counts
p313
aVfor success in mathematics,
p314
aVstudents in North America would typically tell us,
p315
aVyou know, it's all about talent.
p316
aVIf I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.
p317
aVNine out of 10 Japanese students say
p318
aVthat it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,
p319
aVand that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
p320
aa(lp321
VIn the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
p322
aVHigh performers on PISA embrace diversity
p323
aVwith differentiated pedagogical practices.
p324
aVThey realize that
p325
aVordinary students have extraordinary talents,
p326
aVand they personalize learning opportunities.
p327
aa(lp328
VHigh-performing systems also share
p329
aVclear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
p330
aVEvery student knows what matters.
p331
aVEvery student knows what's required to be successful.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd nowhere does the quality of an education system
p334
aVexceed the quality of its teachers.
p335
aVHigh-performing systems are very careful
p336
aVin how they recruit and select their teachers
p337
aVand how they train them.
p338
aVThey watch how they improve the performances of teachers
p339
aVin difficulties who are struggling,
p340
aVand how they structure teacher pay.
p341
aVThey provide an environment also in which teachers work together
p342
aVto frame good practice.
p343
aVAnd they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow
p344
aVin their careers.
p345
aVIn bureaucratic school systems,
p346
aVteachers are often left alone in classrooms
p347
aVwith a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
p348
aVHigh-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.
p349
aVThey set very ambitious standards, but then they enable
p350
aVtheir teachers to figure out,
p351
aVwhat do I need to teach to my students today?
p352
aVThe past was about delivered wisdom in education.
p353
aVNow the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
p354
aVHigh performers have moved on from professional
p355
aVor from administrative forms of accountability and control \u2014
p356
aVsort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education \u2014
p357
aVto professional forms of work organization.
p358
aVThey enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.
p359
aVThey provide them with the kind of development they need
p360
aVto develop stronger pedagogical practices.
p361
aVThe goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
p362
aVHigh-performing systems have made teachers
p363
aVand school principals inventive.
p364
aVIn the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,
p365
aVon provision.
p366
aVThe high-performing systems have helped teachers
p367
aVand school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,
p368
aVthe next school around their lives.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems
p371
aVis that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
p372
aVYou've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,
p373
aVbut what makes Finland so impressive
p374
aVis that only five percent of the performance variation
p375
aVamongst students lies between schools.
p376
aVEvery school succeeds.
p377
aVThis is where success is systemic.
p378
aVAnd how do they do that?
p379
aVThey invest resources where they can make the most difference.
p380
aVThey attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,
p381
aVand the most talented teachers
p382
aVinto the most challenging classroom.
p383
aa(lp384
VLast but not least, those countries align policies
p385
aVacross all areas of public policy.
p386
aVThey make them coherent over sustained periods of time,
p387
aVand they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
p388
aa(lp389
VNow, knowing what successful systems are doing
p390
aVdoesn't yet tell us how to improve.
p391
aVThat's also clear, and that's where some of the limits
p392
aVof international comparisons of PISA are.
p393
aVThat's where other forms of research need to kick in,
p394
aVand that's also why PISA doesn't venture into
p395
aVtelling countries what they should be doing.
p396
aVBut its strength lies in telling them
p397
aVwhat everybody else has been doing.
p398
aVAnd the example of PISA shows that data
p399
aVcan be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy
p400
aVthrough which we usually run education systems.
p401
aa(lp402
VYou know, some people argue that
p403
aVchanging educational administration
p404
aVis like moving graveyards.
p405
aVYou just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)
p406
aVBut PISA has shown what's possible in education.
p407
aVIt has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
p408
aVIt has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.
p409
aVAnd it has helped countries to set meaningful targets
p410
aVin terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
p411
aVIf we can help every child, every teacher, every school,
p412
aVevery principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,
p413
aVthat only the sky is the limit to education improvement,
p414
aVwe have laid the foundations
p415
aVfor better policies and better lives.
