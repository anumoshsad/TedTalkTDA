VEver since I was a little girl
p4
aVseeing "Star Wars" for the first time,
p5
aVI've been fascinated by this idea
p6
aVof personal robots.
p7
aVAnd as a little girl,
p8
aVI loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us
p9
aVmuch more like a helpful, trusted sidekick \u2014
p10
aVsomething that would delight us, enrich our lives
p11
aVand help us save a galaxy or two.
p12
aVI knew robots like that didn't really exist,
p13
aVbut I knew I wanted to build them.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo 20 years pass \u2014
p16
aVI am now a graduate student at MIT
p17
aVstudying artificial intelligence,
p18
aVthe year is 1997,
p19
aVand NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.
p20
aVBut robots are still not in our home, ironically.
p21
aVAnd I remember thinking about
p22
aVall the reasons why that was the case.
p23
aVBut one really struck me.
p24
aVRobotics had really been about interacting with things,
p25
aVnot with people \u2014
p26
aVcertainly not in a social way that would be natural for us
p27
aVand would really help people accept robots
p28
aVinto our daily lives.
p29
aVFor me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.
p30
aVAnd so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,
p31
aVthe world's first social robot.
p32
aVThree years later \u2014
p33
aVa lot of programming,
p34
aVworking with other graduate students in the lab \u2014
p35
aVKismet was ready to start interacting with people.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.
p38
aa(lp39
VKismet: (Nonsense)
p40
aa(lp41
VScientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
p42
aa(lp43
VKismet: (Nonsense)
p44
aa(lp45
VScientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.
p46
aVI almost lost it this week.
p47
aa(lp48
VCynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people
p49
aVlike kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,
p50
aVwhich I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.
p51
aVIt didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.
p52
aVThis little robot was somehow able
p53
aVto tap into something deeply social within us \u2014
p54
aVand with that, the promise of an entirely new way
p55
aVwe could interact with robots.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo over the past several years
p58
aVI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,
p59
aVnow at the media lab
p60
aVwith my own team of incredibly talented students.
p61
aVAnd one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.
p62
aVWe developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.
p63
aVAnd so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
p64
aVThis is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,
p65
aVintroducing Leo to a new object.
p66
aVAnd because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.
p67
aVBut sort of like us, he can actually learn about it
p68
aVfrom watching Matt's reaction.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.
p71
aVLeo, this is Cookie Monster.
p72
aVCan you find Cookie Monster?
p73
aVLeo, Cookie Monster is very bad.
p74
aVHe's very bad, Leo.
p75
aVCookie Monster is very, very bad.
p76
aVHe's a scary monster.
p77
aVHe wants to get your cookies.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VCB: All right, so Leo and Cookie
p82
aVmight have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,
p83
aVbut they get along great now.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo what I've learned
p86
aVthrough building these systems
p87
aVis that robots are actually
p88
aVa really intriguing social technology,
p89
aVwhere it's actually their ability
p90
aVto push our social buttons
p91
aVand to interact with us like a partner
p92
aVthat is a core part of their functionality.
p93
aVAnd with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine
p94
aVnew questions, new possibilities for robots
p95
aVthat we might not have thought about otherwise.
p96
aVBut what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"
p97
aVWell, one of the things that we've learned
p98
aVis that, if we design these robots to communicate with us
p99
aVusing the same body language,
p100
aVthe same sort of non-verbal cues that people use \u2014
p101
aVlike Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here \u2014
p102
aVwhat we find is that people respond to robots
p103
aVa lot like they respond to people.
p104
aVPeople use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,
p105
aVhow likable, how engaging,
p106
aVhow trustworthy.
p107
aVIt turns out it's the same for robots.
p108
aa(lp109
VIt's turning out now
p110
aVthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool
p111
aVto understand human behavior.
p112
aVTo answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,
p113
aVwe're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?
p114
aVMimicry's believed to play a role, but how?
p115
aVIs it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?
p116
aVIt turns out it's really hard
p117
aVto learn this or understand this from watching people
p118
aVbecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.
p119
aVWe can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.
p120
aVBut with the robot, you can.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd so in this video here \u2014
p123
aVthis is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.
p124
aVHe's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.
p125
aVThere's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues
p126
aVto be able to study this question.
p127
aVAnd the bottom line is \u2014 the reason why this works is
p128
aVbecause it turns out people just behave like people
p129
aVeven when interacting with a robot.
p130
aVSo given that key insight,
p131
aVwe can now start to imagine
p132
aVnew kinds of applications for robots.
p133
aVFor instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,
p134
aVmaybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.
p135
aVSo imagine this:
p136
aVWhat about a robot accessory for your cellphone?
p137
aVYou call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,
p138
aVand, bam! You're a MeBot \u2014
p139
aVyou can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,
p140
aVyou can move around, you can gesture \u2014
p141
aVmaybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
p142
aa(lp143
VTo explore this question,
p144
aVmy student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study
p145
aVwhere we brought human participants, people, into our lab
p146
aVto do a collaborative task
p147
aVwith a remote collaborator.
p148
aVThe task involved things
p149
aVlike looking at a set of objects on the table,
p150
aVdiscussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task \u2014
p151
aVthis ended up being a survival task \u2014
p152
aVand then rating them in terms
p153
aVof how valuable and important they thought they were.
p154
aVThe remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group
p155
aVwho used one of three different technologies
p156
aVto interact with the participants.
p157
aVThe first was just the screen.
p158
aVThis is just like video conferencing today.
p159
aVThe next was to add mobility \u2014 so, have the screen on a mobile base.
p160
aVThis is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today \u2014
p161
aVthis is mirroring that situation.
p162
aVAnd then the fully expressive MeBot.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo after the interaction,
p165
aVwe asked people to rate their quality of interaction
p166
aVwith the technology, with a remote collaborator
p167
aVthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.
p168
aVWe looked at psychological involvement \u2014
p169
aVhow much empathy did you feel for the other person?
p170
aVWe looked at overall engagement.
p171
aVWe looked at their desire to cooperate.
p172
aVAnd this is what we see when they use just the screen.
p173
aVIt turns out, when you add mobility \u2014 the ability to roll around the table \u2014
p174
aVyou get a little more of a boost.
p175
aVAnd you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.
p176
aVSo it seems like this physical, social embodiment
p177
aVactually really makes a difference.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow let's try to put this into a little bit of context.
p180
aVToday we know that families are living further and further apart,
p181
aVand that definitely takes a toll on family relationships
p182
aVand family bonds over distance.
p183
aVFor me, I have three young boys,
p184
aVand I want them to have a really good relationship
p185
aVwith their grandparents.
p186
aVBut my parents live thousands of miles away,
p187
aVso they just don't get to see each other that often.
p188
aVWe try Skype, we try phone calls,
p189
aVbut my boys are little \u2014 they don't really want to talk;
p190
aVthey want to play.
p191
aVSo I love the idea of thinking about robots
p192
aVas a new kind of distance-play technology.
p193
aVI imagine a time not too far from now \u2014
p194
aVmy mom can go to her computer,
p195
aVopen up a browser and jack into a little robot.
p196
aVAnd as grandma-bot,
p197
aVshe can now play, really play,
p198
aVwith my sons, with her grandsons,
p199
aVin the real world with his real toys.
p200
aVI could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays
p201
aVwith their granddaughters, with their friends,
p202
aVand to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,
p203
aVlike sharing a bedtime story.
p204
aVAnd through this technology,
p205
aVbeing able to be an active participant
p206
aVin their grandchildren's lives
p207
aVin a way that's not possible today.
p208
aa(lp209
VLet's think about some other domains,
p210
aVlike maybe health.
p211
aVSo in the United States today,
p212
aVover 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,
p213
aVand now it's a big problem with our children as well.
p214
aVAnd we know that as you get older in life,
p215
aVif you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases
p216
aVthat not only reduce your quality of life,
p217
aVbut are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.
p218
aVBut if robots can be engaging,
p219
aVif we like to cooperate with robots,
p220
aVif robots are persuasive,
p221
aVmaybe a robot can help you
p222
aVmaintain a diet and exercise program,
p223
aVmaybe they can help you manage your weight.
p224
aVSort of like a digital Jiminy \u2014
p225
aVas in the well-known fairy tale \u2014
p226
aVa kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there
p227
aVto be able to help you make the right decision
p228
aVin the right way at the right time
p229
aVto help you form healthy habits.
p230
aVSo we actually explored this idea in our lab.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is a robot, Autom.
p233
aVCory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
p234
aVAnd it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
p235
aVIt had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
p236
aVIt could make eye contact with you.
p237
aVIt could share information looking down at a screen.
p238
aVYou'd use a screen interface to enter information,
p239
aVlike how many calories you ate that day,
p240
aVhow much exercise you got.
p241
aVAnd then it could help track that for you.
p242
aVAnd the robot spoke with a synthetic voice
p243
aVto engage you in a coaching dialogue
p244
aVmodeled after trainers
p245
aVand patients and so forth.
p246
aVAnd it would build a working alliance with you
p247
aVthrough that dialogue.
p248
aVIt could help you set goals and track your progress,
p249
aVand it would help motivate you.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo an interesting question is,
p252
aVdoes the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?
p253
aVIs it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?
p254
aVTo explore that question,
p255
aVwe did a study in the Boston area
p256
aVwhere we put one of three interventions in people's homes
p257
aVfor a period of several weeks.
p258
aVOne case was the robot you saw there, Autom.
p259
aVAnother was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,
p260
aVran exactly the same dialogues.
p261
aVThe quality of advice was identical.
p262
aVAnd the third was just a pen and paper log,
p263
aVbecause that's the standard intervention you typically get
p264
aVwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo one of the things we really wanted to look at
p267
aVwas not how much weight people lost,
p268
aVbut really how long they interacted with the robot.
p269
aVBecause the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.
p270
aVAnd the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,
p271
aVwell that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.
p272
aVSo the first thing I want to look at is how long,
p273
aVhow long did people interact with these systems.
p274
aVIt turns out that people interacted with the robot
p275
aVsignificantly more,
p276
aVeven though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.
p277
aVWhen it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,
p278
aVpeople rated the robot higher
p279
aVand they trusted the robot more.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aVAnd when you look at emotional engagement,
p282
aVit was completely different.
p283
aVPeople would name the robots.
p284
aVThey would dress the robots.
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVAnd even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,
p287
aVthey would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
p288
aVThey didn't do this with a computer.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe last thing I want to talk about today
p291
aVis the future of children's media.
p292
aVWe know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,
p293
aVwhether it's television or computer games or whatnot.
p294
aVMy sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.
p295
aVBut I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,
p296
aVlike, real-world play.
p297
aVAnd so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today
p298
aVcalled Playtime Computing
p299
aVthat's really trying to think about how we can take
p300
aVwhat's so engaging about digital media
p301
aVand literally bring it off the screen
p302
aVinto the real world of the child,
p303
aVwhere it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.
p304
aVSo here's the first exploration of this idea,
p305
aVwhere characters can be physical or virtual,
p306
aVand where the digital content
p307
aVcan literally come off the screen
p308
aVinto the world and back.
p309
aVI like to think of this
p310
aVas the Atari Pong
p311
aVof this blended-reality play.
p312
aa(lp313
VBut we can push this idea further.
p314
aVWhat if \u2014
p315
aV(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
p316
aVCB: \u2014 the character itself could come into your world?
p317
aVIt turns out that kids love it
p318
aVwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.
p319
aVAnd when it's in their world,
p320
aVthey can relate to it and play with it in a way
p321
aVthat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
p322
aVAnother important idea is this notion
p323
aVof persistence of character across realities.
p324
aVSo changes that children make in the real world
p325
aVneed to translate to the virtual world.
p326
aVSo here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
p327
aVYou can imagine maybe these symbols
p328
aVgive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.
p329
aVSo they are now sending the character back into that world.
p330
aVAnd now it's got number power.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd then finally, what I've been trying to do here
p333
aVis create a really immersive experience for kids,
p334
aVwhere they really feel like they are part of that story,
p335
aVa part of that experience.
p336
aVAnd I really want to spark their imaginations
p337
aVthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."
p338
aVBut I want to do more than that.
p339
aVI actually want them to create those experiences.
p340
aVI want them to be able to literally build their imagination
p341
aVinto these experiences and make them their own.
p342
aVSo we've been exploring a lot of ideas
p343
aVin telepresence and mixed reality
p344
aVto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space
p345
aVwhere other kids can interact with them
p346
aVand build upon them.
p347
aVI really want to come up with new ways of children's media
p348
aVthat foster creativity and learning and innovation.
p349
aVI think that's very, very important.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo this is a new project.
p352
aVWe've invited a lot of kids into this space,
p353
aVand they think it's pretty cool.
p354
aVBut I can tell you, the thing that they love the most
p355
aVis the robot.
p356
aVWhat they care about is the robot.
p357
aVRobots touch something deeply human within us.
p358
aVAnd so whether they're helping us
p359
aVto become creative and innovative,
p360
aVor whether they're helping us
p361
aVto feel more deeply connected despite distance,
p362
aVor whether they are our trusted sidekick
p363
aVwho's helping us attain our personal goals
p364
aVin becoming our highest and best selves,
p365
aVfor me, robots are all about people.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.
