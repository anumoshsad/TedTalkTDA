VHenry Evans: Hello.
p9
aVMy name is Henry Evans,
p10
aVand until August 29, 2002,
p11
aVI was living my version of the American dream.
p12
aVI grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.
p13
aVMy dad was a lawyer.
p14
aVMy mom was a homemaker.
p15
aVMy six siblings and I were good kids,
p16
aVbut caused our fair share of trouble.
p17
aVAfter high school, I left home to study
p18
aVand learn more about the world.
p19
aVI went to Notre Dame University
p20
aVand graduated with degrees in accounting and German,
p21
aVincluding spending a year of study in Austria.
p22
aVLater on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.
p23
aVI married my high school sweetheart, Jane.
p24
aVI am lucky to have her.
p25
aVTogether, we raised four wonderful children.
p26
aVI worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder,
p27
aVeventually becoming a chief financial officer
p28
aVin Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.
p29
aVMy family and I bought our first and only home
p30
aVon December 13, 2001,
p31
aVa fixer-upper in a beautiful spot
p32
aVof Los Altos Hills, California,
p33
aVfrom where I am speaking to you now.
p34
aa(lp35
VWe were looking forward to rebuilding it,
p36
aVbut eight months after we moved in,
p37
aVI suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect.
p38
aVOvernight, I became a mute quadriplegic
p39
aVat the ripe old age of 40.
p40
aVIt took me several years,
p41
aVbut with the help of an incredibly supportive family,
p42
aVI finally decided life was still worth living.
p43
aVI became fascinated with using technology
p44
aVto help the severely disabled.
p45
aVHead tracking devices sold commercially
p46
aVby the company Madentec
p47
aVconvert my tiny head movements into cursor movements,
p48
aVand enable my use of a regular computer.
p49
aVI can surf the web, exchange email with people,
p50
aVand routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins
p51
aVin online word games.
p52
aVThis technology allows me to remain engaged,
p53
aVmentally active,
p54
aVand feel like I am a part of the world.
p55
aa(lp56
VOne day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,
p57
aVwhen I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp
p58
aVof the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech
p59
aVdemonstrating a PR2 robot.
p60
aVI emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,
p61
aVand we formed the Robots for Humanity project.
p62
aVFor about two years, Robots for Humanity
p63
aVdeveloped ways for me to use the PR2
p64
aVas my body surrogate.
p65
aVI shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.
p66
aVFrom my home in California,
p67
aVI shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)
p68
aVI handed out Halloween candy.
p69
aVI opened my refrigerator on my own.
p70
aVI began doing tasks around the house.
p71
aVI saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities
p72
aVto live and contribute,
p73
aVboth for myself and others in my circumstance.
p74
aa(lp75
VAll of us have disabilities in one form or another.
p76
aVFor example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour,
p77
aVboth of us will need an assistive device called a car.
p78
aVYour disability doesn't make you any less of a person,
p79
aVand neither does mine.
p80
aVBy the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)
p81
aVSince birth, we have both suffered from the inability
p82
aVto fly on our own.
p83
aa(lp84
VLast year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage
p85
aVconnected with me Chad Jenkins.
p86
aVChad showed me how easy it is
p87
aVto purchase and fly aerial drones.
p88
aVIt was then I realized that I could also use
p89
aVan aerial drone to expand the worlds
p90
aVof bedridden people through flight,
p91
aVgiving a sense of movement and control
p92
aVthat is incredible.
p93
aVUsing a mouse cursor I control with my head,
p94
aVthese web interfaces allow me
p95
aVto see video from the robot
p96
aVand send control commands
p97
aVby pressing buttons in a web browser.
p98
aVWith a little practice, I became good enough with this interface
p99
aVto drive around my home on my own.
p100
aVI could look around our garden
p101
aVand see the grapes we are growing.
p102
aVI inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)
p103
aVOne of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone
p104
aVon our basketball hoop.
p105
aVI went even further by seeing if I could use
p106
aVa head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,
p107
aVas modified by Fighting Walrus,
p108
aVto have an immersive experience
p109
aVcontrolling the drone.
p110
aVWith Chad's group at Brown,
p111
aVI regularly fly drones around his lab
p112
aVseveral times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away.
p113
aVAll work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,
p114
aVso we also find time to play friendly games
p115
aVof robot soccer. (Laughter)
p116
aVI never thought I would be able to casually
p117
aVmove around a campus like Brown on my own.
p118
aVI just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VChad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,
p121
aVI bet all of these people here
p122
aVwould love to see you fly this drone
p123
aVfrom your bed in California 3,000 miles away.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VOkay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAre you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VCan you show us how excited you are?
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VAll right, big finish.
p140
aVCan you show us how good of a pilot you are?
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VAll right, we still have a little ways to go with that,
p145
aVbut I think it shows the promise.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat makes Henry's story amazing
p148
aVis it's about understanding Henry's needs,
p149
aVunderstanding what people in Henry's situation
p150
aVneed from technology,
p151
aVand then also understanding
p152
aVwhat advanced technology can provide,
p153
aVand then bringing those two things together
p154
aVfor use in a wise and responsible way.
p155
aVWhat we're trying to do is democratize robotics,
p156
aVso that anybody can be a part of this.
p157
aVWe're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms
p158
aVsuch as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,
p159
aVthe Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars,
p160
aValong with open-source robotics software
p161
aVso that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.
p162
aVAnd our hope is that, by providing these tools,
p163
aVthat you'll be able to think of better ways
p164
aVto provide movement for the disabled,
p165
aVto provide care for our aging population,
p166
aVto help better educate our children,
p167
aVto think about what the new types
p168
aVof middle class jobs could be for the future,
p169
aVto both monitor and protect our environment,
p170
aVand to explore the universe.
p171
aa(lp172
VBack to you, Henry.
p173
aa(lp174
VHE: Thank you, Chad.
p175
aa(lp176
VWith this drone setup, we show the potential
p177
aVfor bedridden people to once again be able
p178
aVto explore the outside world,
p179
aVand robotics will eventually provide
p180
aVa level playing field
p181
aVwhere one is only limited by their mental acuity
p182
aVand imagination,
p183
aVwhere the disabled are able to perform
p184
aVthe same activities as everyone else,
p185
aVand perhaps better,
p186
aVand technology will even allow us to provide
p187
aVan outlet for many people who are presently
p188
aVconsidered vegetables.
p189
aVOne hundred years ago,
p190
aVI would have been treated like a vegetable.
p191
aVActually, that's not true.
p192
aVI would have died.
p193
aa(lp194
VIt is up to us, all of us, to decide how
p195
aVrobotics will be used, for good or for evil,
p196
aVfor simply replacing people
p197
aVor for making people better,
p198
aVfor allowing us to do and enjoy more.
p199
aa(lp200
VOur goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power
p201
aVby making the world more physically accessible
p202
aVto people such as myself and others like me
p203
aVaround the globe.
p204
aVWith the help of people like you,
p205
aVwe can make this dream a reality.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you.
