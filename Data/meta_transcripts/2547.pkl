V"Mom, who are these people?"
p4
aVIt was an innocent question from my young daughter Alia
p5
aVaround the time when she was three.
p6
aVWe were walking along with my husband
p7
aVin one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.
p8
aVAlia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall.
p9
aVIt featured the three rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
p10
aVAs she tucked in my side,
p11
aVI bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the UAE
p12
aVwho had worked hard to develop their nation
p13
aVand preserve its unity.
p14
aVShe asked, "Mom, why is it that here where we live,
p15
aVand back in Lebanon, where grandma and grandpa live,
p16
aVwe never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls?
p17
aVIs it because women are not important?"
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is probably the hardest question I've had to answer in my years as a parent
p20
aVand in my 16-plus years of professional life, for that matter.
p21
aVI had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,
p22
aVthe younger of two daughters to a very hard-working pilot
p23
aVand director of operations for the Lebanese Airlines
p24
aVand a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma.
p25
aVMy father had encouraged my sister and I to pursue our education
p26
aVeven though our culture emphasized at the time
p27
aVthat it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated.
p28
aVI was one of very few girls of my generation
p29
aVwho left home at 18 to study abroad.
p30
aVMy father didn't have a son,
p31
aVand so I, in a sense, became his.
p32
aa(lp33
VFast-forward a couple of decades, and I hope I didn't do too badly
p34
aVin making my father proud of his would-be son.
p35
aVAs I got my Bachelor's and PhD in electrical engineering,
p36
aVdid R&D in the UK, then consulting in the Middle East,
p37
aVI have always been in male-dominated environments.
p38
aVTruth be told, I have never found a role model I could truly identify with.
p39
aVMy mother's generation wasn't into professional leadership.
p40
aVThere were some encouraging men along the way,
p41
aVbut none knew the demands and pressures I was facing,
p42
aVpressures that got particularly acute when I had my own two beautiful children.
p43
aVAnd although Western women love to give us poor, oppressed Arab women advice,
p44
aVthey live different lives with different constraints.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo Arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models.
p47
aVWe have had to juggle more than Arab men,
p48
aVand we have had to face more cultural rigidity than Western women.
p49
aVAs a result, I would like to think that we poor, oppressed women
p50
aVactually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share,
p51
aVlessons that might turn out useful
p52
aVfor anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world.
p53
aVHere are three of mine.
p54
aa(lp55
V["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VThere is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success:
p62
aVresilience.
p63
aVWell, what exactly is resilience, and how do you develop it?
p64
aVI believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel.
p65
aa(lp66
VIn my previous job, well before my current firm,
p67
aVI was working with a man we will call John.
p68
aVI had teamed up with John and was working hard,
p69
aVhoping he would notice how great I was
p70
aVand that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm.
p71
aVI was, in addition to delivering on my consulting projects,
p72
aVwriting passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment.
p73
aVOne day, I got to present my research to a roomful of MBA students.
p74
aVJohn was part of the audience
p75
aVlistening for the first time to the details of my study.
p76
aVAs I proceeded with my presentation,
p77
aVI could see John in the corner of my eye.
p78
aVHe had turned a dark shade of pink
p79
aVand had slid under his chair in apparent shame.
p80
aa(lp81
VI finished my presentation to an applauding audience
p82
aVand we rushed out and jumped into the car.
p83
aVThere he exploded.
p84
aV"What you did up there was unacceptable!
p85
aVYou are a consultant, not an activist!"
p86
aVI said, "John, I don't understand.
p87
aVI presented a couple of gender parity indices,
p88
aVand some conclusions about the Arab world.
p89
aVYes, we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index,
p90
aVbut what is it that I said or presented that was not factual?"
p91
aa(lp92
VTo which he replied, "The whole premise of your study is wrong.
p93
aVWhat you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society."
p94
aVHe paused, then added,
p95
aV"When women have children, their place is in the home."
p96
aa(lp97
VTime stood still for a long while,
p98
aVand all I could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was:
p99
aV"You can forget about that partnership, Leila.
p100
aVIt's just never going to happen."
p101
aVIt took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications,
p102
aVbut once I did, I reached three conclusions.
p103
aVOne, that these were his issues,
p104
aVhis complexes.
p105
aVThere may be many like him in our society,
p106
aVbut I would never let their issues become mine.
p107
aVTwo, that I needed another sponsor, and fast.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VI got one, by the way, and boy, was he great.
p112
aVAnd three, that I would get to show John what women with children can do.
p113
aVI apply this lesson equally well to my personal life.
p114
aVAs I have progressed in my career,
p115
aVI have received many words of encouragement,
p116
aVbut I have also often been met by women, men and couples
p117
aVwho have clearly had an issue with my husband and I
p118
aVhaving chosen the path of a dual-career couple.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo you get this well-meaning couple
p121
aVwho tells you straight out at a family gathering
p122
aVor at a friends gathering,
p123
aVthat, come on, you must know you're not a great mom,
p124
aVgiven how much you're investing in your career, right?
p125
aVI would lie if I said these words didn't hurt.
p126
aVMy children are the most precious thing to me,
p127
aVand the thought that I could be failing them in any way is intolerable.
p128
aVBut just like I did with John,
p129
aVI quickly reminded myself that these were their issues,
p130
aVtheir complexes.
p131
aVSo instead of replying,
p132
aVI gave back one of my largest smiles
p133
aVas I saw, in flashing light,
p134
aVthe following sign in my mind's eye.
p135
aa(lp136
V[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VYou see, as a young woman in these situations, you have two options.
p141
aVYou can either decide to internalize these negative messages
p142
aVthat are being thrown at you,
p143
aVto let them make you feel like a failure,
p144
aVlike success is way too hard to ever achieve,
p145
aVor you can choose to see that others' negativity is their own issue,
p146
aVand instead transform it into your own personal fuel.
p147
aVI have learned to always go for option two,
p148
aVand I have found that it has taken me from strength to strength.
p149
aVAnd it's true what they say:
p150
aVsuccess is the best revenge.
p151
aa(lp152
VSome women in the Middle East
p153
aVare lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career.
p154
aVCorrection: I should say "smart enough,"
p155
aVbecause who you marry is your own choice,
p156
aVand you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career.
p157
aVStill today, the Arab man is not an equal contributor in the home.
p158
aVIt's simply not expected by our society,
p159
aVand even frowned upon as not very manly.
p160
aVAs for the Arab woman, our society still assumes
p161
aVthat her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity
p162
aVof her children and husband.
p163
aVShe mostly exists for her family.
p164
aVThings are changing, but it will take time.
p165
aa(lp166
VFor now, it means that the professional Arab woman
p167
aVhas to somehow maintain the perfect home,
p168
aVmake sure that her children's every need is being taken care of
p169
aVand manage her demanding career.
p170
aVTo achieve this, I have found the hard way
p171
aVthat you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life.
p172
aVYou need to work your life.
p173
aa(lp174
VHere is how I do this in my personal life.
p175
aVOne thing to know about the Middle East
p176
aVis that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help.
p177
aVThe challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively.
p178
aVJust like I would in my business life, I have based the selection
p179
aVof who would support me with my children while I'm at work
p180
aVon a strong referral.
p181
aVCristina had worked for four years with my sister
p182
aVand the quality of her work was well-established.
p183
aVShe is now an integral member of our family,
p184
aVhaving been with us since Alia was six months old.
p185
aVShe makes sure that the house is running smoothly while I'm at work,
p186
aVand I make sure to empower her
p187
aVin the most optimal conditions for her and my children,
p188
aVjust like I would my best talent at work.
p189
aVThis lesson applies whatever your childcare situation,
p190
aVwhether an au pair, nursery,
p191
aVpart-time nanny that you share with someone else.
p192
aVChoose very carefully, and empower.
p193
aa(lp194
VIf you look at my calendar,
p195
aVyou will see every working day
p196
aVone and a half hours from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time
p197
aVblocked and called "family time."
p198
aVThis is sacred time.
p199
aVI have done this ever since Alia was a baby.
p200
aVI do everything in my power to protect this time
p201
aVso that I can be home by then to spend quality time with my children,
p202
aVasking them about their day,
p203
aVchecking up on homework, reading them a bedtime story
p204
aVand giving them lots of kisses and cuddles.
p205
aVIf I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone,
p206
aVI use Skype to connect with my children even if I am miles away.
p207
aVOur son Burhan is five years old,
p208
aVand he's learning to read and do basic maths.
p209
aa(lp210
VHere's another confession:
p211
aVI have found that our daughter is actually more successful
p212
aVat teaching him these skills than I am.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VIt started as a game, but Alia loves playing teacher to her little brother,
p217
aVand I have found that these sessions actually improve Burhan's literacy,
p218
aVincrease Alia's sense of responsibility,
p219
aVand strengthen the bonding between them,
p220
aVa win-win all around.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe successful Arab women I know
p223
aVhave each found their unique approach to working their life
p224
aVas they continue to shoulder
p225
aVthe lion's share of responsibility in the home.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut this is not just about surviving in your dual role
p228
aVas a career woman and mother.
p229
aVThis is also about being in the present.
p230
aVWhen I am with my children,
p231
aVI try to leave work out of our lives.
p232
aVInstead of worrying about how many minutes I can spend with them every day,
p233
aVI focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments,
p234
aVmoments where I'm seeing my kids,
p235
aVhearing them, connecting with them.
p236
aa(lp237
V["Join forces, don't compete."]
p238
aa(lp239
VArab women of my generation have not been very visible
p240
aVin the public eye as they grew up.
p241
aVThis explains, I think, to some extent,
p242
aVwhy you find so few women in politics in the Arab world.
p243
aVThe upside of this, however,
p244
aVis that we have spent a lot of time
p245
aVdeveloping a social skill behind the scenes,
p246
aVin coffee shops, in living rooms,
p247
aVon the phone,
p248
aVa social skill that is very important to success:
p249
aVnetworking.
p250
aVI would say the average Arab woman
p251
aVhas a large network of friends and acquaintances.
p252
aVThe majority of those are also women.
p253
aa(lp254
VIn the West, it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women
p255
aVhoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room.
p256
aVThis leads to the much-spoken-about competitive behavior
p257
aVbetween professional women.
p258
aVIf there's only room for one woman at the top,
p259
aVthen you can't make room for others, much less lift them up.
p260
aa(lp261
VArab women, generally speaking,
p262
aVhave not fallen for this psychological trap.
p263
aVFaced with a patriarchal society,
p264
aVthey have found that by helping each other out,
p265
aVall benefit.
p266
aa(lp267
VIn my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East,
p268
aVso one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues
p269
aVcouldn't bring many benefits
p270
aVand that I should instead invest my time
p271
aVdeveloping my relationships with male seniors and peers.
p272
aVYet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women.
p273
aVIt was the head of marketing who initially suggested
p274
aVI be considered as a young global leader to the World Economic Forum.
p275
aVShe was familiar with my media engagements and my publications,
p276
aVand when she was asked to voice her opinion,
p277
aVshe highlighted my name.
p278
aVIt was a young consultant, a Saudi lady and friend,
p279
aVwho helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia,
p280
aVa market I was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman.
p281
aVShe introduced me to a client,
p282
aVand that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in Saudi.
p283
aVToday, I have two senior women on my team,
p284
aVand I see making them successful as key to my own success.
p285
aVWomen continue to advance in the world,
p286
aVnot fast enough, but we're moving.
p287
aa(lp288
VThe Arab world, too, is making progress, despite many recent setbacks.
p289
aVJust this year, the UAE appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet,
p290
aVfor a total of eight female ministers.
p291
aVThat's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,
p292
aVand more than many developed countries can claim.
p293
aVThis is today my daughter Alia's favorite picture.
p294
aVThis is the result, no doubt, of great leadership,
p295
aVbut it is also the result of strong Arab women
p296
aVnot giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries.
p297
aVIt is the result of Arab women deciding every day like me
p298
aVto convert shit into fuel,
p299
aVto work their life to keep work out of their life,
p300
aVand to join forces and not compete.
p301
aa(lp302
VAs I look to the future,
p303
aVmy hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage
p304
aVsome 20, 30 years from now
p305
aVare that she be as proud to call herself her mother's daughter
p306
aVas her father's daughter.
p307
aa(lp308
VMy hopes for my son
p309
aVare that by then, the expression "her mother's son" or "mama's boy"
p310
aVwould have taken on a completely different meaning.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.
