VIt's Monday morning.
p4
aVIn Washington,
p5
aVthe president of the United States
p6
aVis sitting in the Oval Office,
p7
aVassessing whether or not
p8
aVto strike Al Qaeda
p9
aVin Yemen.
p10
aVAt Number 10 Downing Street,
p11
aVDavid Cameron is trying to work out
p12
aVwhether to cut more public sector jobs
p13
aVin order to stave off a double-dip recession.
p14
aVIn Madrid, Maria Gonzalez
p15
aVis standing at the door,
p16
aVlistening to her baby crying and crying,
p17
aVtrying to work out whether she should let it cry
p18
aVuntil it falls asleep
p19
aVor pick it up and hold it.
p20
aVAnd I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,
p21
aVtrying to work out
p22
aVwhether I should let him drink
p23
aVthe one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water
p24
aVthat his doctors just came in and said,
p25
aV"You must make him drink today," \u2014
p26
aVmy father's been nil by mouth for a week \u2014
p27
aVor whether, by giving him this bottle,
p28
aVI might actually kill him.
p29
aa(lp30
VWe face momentous decisions
p31
aVwith important consequences
p32
aVthroughout our lives,
p33
aVand we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
p34
aVWe talk things over with our friends,
p35
aVwe scour the Internet,
p36
aVwe search through books.
p37
aVBut still,
p38
aVeven in this age
p39
aVof Google and TripAdvisor
p40
aVand Amazon Recommends,
p41
aVit's still experts
p42
aVthat we rely upon most \u2014
p43
aVespecially when the stakes are high
p44
aVand the decision really matters.
p45
aVBecause in a world of data deluge
p46
aVand extreme complexity,
p47
aVwe believe that experts
p48
aVare more able to process information than we can \u2014
p49
aVthat they are able to come to better conclusions
p50
aVthan we could come to on our own.
p51
aVAnd in an age
p52
aVthat is sometimes nowadays frightening
p53
aVor confusing,
p54
aVwe feel reassured
p55
aVby the almost parental-like authority
p56
aVof experts
p57
aVwho tell us so clearly what it is
p58
aVwe can and cannot do.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut I believe
p61
aVthat this is a big problem,
p62
aVa problem with potentially dangerous consequences
p63
aVfor us as a society,
p64
aVas a culture
p65
aVand as individuals.
p66
aVIt's not that experts
p67
aVhave not massively contributed to the world \u2014
p68
aVof course they have.
p69
aVThe problem lies with us:
p70
aVwe've become addicted to experts.
p71
aVWe've become addicted to their certainty,
p72
aVtheir assuredness,
p73
aVtheir definitiveness,
p74
aVand in the process,
p75
aVwe have ceded our responsibility,
p76
aVsubstituting our intellect
p77
aVand our intelligence
p78
aVfor their supposed words of wisdom.
p79
aVWe've surrendered our power,
p80
aVtrading off our discomfort
p81
aVwith uncertainty
p82
aVfor the illusion of certainty
p83
aVthat they provide.
p84
aVThis is no exaggeration.
p85
aVIn a recent experiment,
p86
aVa group of adults
p87
aVhad their brains scanned in an MRI machine
p88
aVas they were listening to experts speak.
p89
aVThe results were quite extraordinary.
p90
aVAs they listened to the experts' voices,
p91
aVthe independent decision-making parts of their brains
p92
aVswitched off.
p93
aVIt literally flat-lined.
p94
aVAnd they listened to whatever the experts said
p95
aVand took their advice, however right or wrong.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut experts do get things wrong.
p98
aVDid you know that studies show
p99
aVthat doctors misdiagnose
p100
aVfour times out of 10?
p101
aVDid you know
p102
aVthat if you file your tax returns yourself,
p103
aVyou're statistically more likely
p104
aVto be filing them correctly
p105
aVthan if you get a tax adviser
p106
aVto do it for you?
p107
aVAnd then there's, of course, the example
p108
aVthat we're all too aware of:
p109
aVfinancial experts
p110
aVgetting it so wrong
p111
aVthat we're living through the worst recession
p112
aVsince the 1930s.
p113
aVFor the sake of our health,
p114
aVour wealth
p115
aVand our collective security,
p116
aVit's imperative that we keep
p117
aVthe independent decision-making parts of our brains
p118
aVswitched on.
p119
aVAnd I'm saying this as an economist
p120
aVwho, over the past few years,
p121
aVhas focused my research
p122
aVon what it is we think
p123
aVand who it is we trust and why,
p124
aVbut also \u2014
p125
aVand I'm aware of the irony here \u2014
p126
aVas an expert myself,
p127
aVas a professor,
p128
aVas somebody who advises prime ministers,
p129
aVheads of big companies,
p130
aVinternational organizations,
p131
aVbut an expert who believes
p132
aVthat the role of experts needs to change,
p133
aVthat we need to become more open-minded,
p134
aVmore democratic
p135
aVand be more open
p136
aVto people rebelling against
p137
aVour points of view.
p138
aVSo in order to help you understand
p139
aVwhere I'm coming from,
p140
aVlet me bring you into my world,
p141
aVthe world of experts.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow there are, of course, exceptions,
p144
aVwonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.
p145
aVBut what my research has shown me
p146
aVis that experts tend on the whole
p147
aVto form very rigid camps,
p148
aVthat within these camps,
p149
aVa dominant perspective emerges
p150
aVthat often silences opposition,
p151
aVthat experts move with the prevailing winds,
p152
aVoften hero-worshipping
p153
aVtheir own gurus.
p154
aVAlan Greenspan's proclamations
p155
aVthat the years of economic growth
p156
aVwould go on and on,
p157
aVnot challenged by his peers,
p158
aVuntil after the crisis, of course.
p159
aVYou see,
p160
aVwe also learn
p161
aVthat experts are located,
p162
aVare governed,
p163
aVby the social and cultural norms
p164
aVof their times \u2014
p165
aVwhether it be the doctors
p166
aVin Victorian England, say,
p167
aVwho sent women to asylums
p168
aVfor expressing sexual desire,
p169
aVor the psychiatrists in the United States
p170
aVwho, up until 1973,
p171
aVwere still categorizing homosexuality
p172
aVas a mental illness.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd what all this means
p175
aVis that paradigms
p176
aVtake far too long to shift,
p177
aVthat complexity and nuance are ignored
p178
aVand also that money talks \u2014
p179
aVbecause we've all seen the evidence
p180
aVof pharmaceutical companies
p181
aVfunding studies of drugs
p182
aVthat conveniently leave out
p183
aVtheir worst side effects,
p184
aVor studies funded by food companies
p185
aVof their new products,
p186
aVmassively exaggerating the health benefits
p187
aVof the products they're about to bring by market.
p188
aVThe study showed that food companies exaggerated
p189
aVtypically seven times more
p190
aVthan an independent study.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd we've also got to be aware
p193
aVthat experts, of course,
p194
aValso make mistakes.
p195
aVThey make mistakes every single day \u2014
p196
aVmistakes born out of carelessness.
p197
aVA recent study in the Archives of Surgery
p198
aVreported surgeons
p199
aVremoving healthy ovaries,
p200
aVoperating on the wrong side of the brain,
p201
aVcarrying out procedures on the wrong hand,
p202
aVelbow, eye, foot,
p203
aVand also mistakes born out of thinking errors.
p204
aVA common thinking error
p205
aVof radiologists, for example \u2014
p206
aVwhen they look at CT scans \u2014
p207
aVis that they're overly influenced
p208
aVby whatever it is
p209
aVthat the referring physician has said
p210
aVthat he suspects
p211
aVthe patient's problem to be.
p212
aVSo if a radiologist
p213
aVis looking at the scan
p214
aVof a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,
p215
aVwhat happens is that,
p216
aVif they see evidence
p217
aVof pneumonia on the scan,
p218
aVthey literally stop looking at it \u2014
p219
aVthereby missing the tumor
p220
aVsitting three inches below
p221
aVon the patient's lungs.
p222
aa(lp223
VI've shared with you so far
p224
aVsome insights into the world of experts.
p225
aVThese are, of course,
p226
aVnot the only insights I could share,
p227
aVbut I hope they give you a clear sense at least
p228
aVof why we need to stop kowtowing to them,
p229
aVwhy we need to rebel
p230
aVand why we need to switch
p231
aVour independent decision-making capabilities on.
p232
aVBut how can we do this?
p233
aVWell for the sake of time,
p234
aVI want to focus on just three strategies.
p235
aVFirst, we've got to be ready and willing
p236
aVto take experts on
p237
aVand dispense with this notion of them
p238
aVas modern-day apostles.
p239
aVThis doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.
p240
aVin every single subject,
p241
aVyou'll be relieved to hear.
p242
aVBut it does mean persisting
p243
aVin the face of their inevitable annoyance
p244
aVwhen, for example,
p245
aVwe want them to explain things to us
p246
aVin language that we can actually understand.
p247
aVWhy was it that, when I had an operation,
p248
aVmy doctor said to me,
p249
aV"Beware, Ms. Hertz,
p250
aVof hyperpyrexia,"
p251
aVwhen he could have just as easily said,
p252
aV"Watch out for a high fever."
p253
aVYou see, being ready to take experts on
p254
aVis about also being willing
p255
aVto dig behind their graphs,
p256
aVtheir equations, their forecasts,
p257
aVtheir prophecies,
p258
aVand being armed with the questions to do that \u2014
p259
aVquestions like:
p260
aVWhat are the assumptions that underpin this?
p261
aVWhat is the evidence upon which this is based?
p262
aVWhat has your investigation focused on?
p263
aVAnd what has it ignored?
p264
aa(lp265
VIt recently came out
p266
aVthat experts trialing drugs
p267
aVbefore they come to market
p268
aVtypically trial drugs
p269
aVfirst, primarily on male animals
p270
aVand then, primarily on men.
p271
aVIt seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact
p272
aVthat over half the world's population are women.
p273
aVAnd women have drawn the short medical straw
p274
aVbecause it now turns out that many of these drugs
p275
aVdon't work nearly as well on women
p276
aVas they do on men \u2014
p277
aVand the drugs that do work well work so well
p278
aVthat they're actively harmful for women to take.
p279
aVBeing a rebel is about recognizing
p280
aVthat experts' assumptions
p281
aVand their methodologies
p282
aVcan easily be flawed.
p283
aa(lp284
VSecond,
p285
aVwe need to create the space
p286
aVfor what I call "managed dissent."
p287
aVIf we are to shift paradigms,
p288
aVif we are to make breakthroughs,
p289
aVif we are to destroy myths,
p290
aVwe need to create an environment
p291
aVin which expert ideas are battling it out,
p292
aVin which we're bringing in
p293
aVnew, diverse, discordant, heretical views
p294
aVinto the discussion,
p295
aVfearlessly,
p296
aVin the knowledge that progress comes about,
p297
aVnot only from the creation of ideas,
p298
aVbut also from their destruction \u2014
p299
aVand also from the knowledge
p300
aVthat, by surrounding ourselves
p301
aVby divergent, discordant,
p302
aVheretical views.
p303
aVAll the research now shows us
p304
aVthat this actually makes us smarter.
p305
aVEncouraging dissent is a rebellious notion
p306
aVbecause it goes against our very instincts,
p307
aVwhich are to surround ourselves
p308
aVwith opinions and advice
p309
aVthat we already believe
p310
aVor want to be true.
p311
aVAnd that's why I talk about the need
p312
aVto actively manage dissent.
p313
aa(lp314
VGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt
p315
aVis a practical practitioner
p316
aVof this philosophy.
p317
aVIn meetings, he looks out for the person in the room \u2014
p318
aVarms crossed, looking a bit bemused \u2014
p319
aVand draws them into the discussion,
p320
aVtrying to see if they indeed are
p321
aVthe person with a different opinion,
p322
aVso that they have dissent within the room.
p323
aVManaging dissent
p324
aVis about recognizing the value
p325
aVof disagreement, discord
p326
aVand difference.
p327
aVBut we need to go even further.
p328
aVWe need to fundamentally redefine
p329
aVwho it is that experts are.
p330
aVThe conventional notion
p331
aVis that experts are people
p332
aVwith advanced degrees,
p333
aVfancy titles, diplomas,
p334
aVbest-selling books \u2014
p335
aVhigh-status individuals.
p336
aVBut just imagine
p337
aVif we were to junk
p338
aVthis notion of expertise
p339
aVas some sort of elite cadre
p340
aVand instead embrace the notion
p341
aVof democratized expertise \u2014
p342
aVwhereby expertise was not just the preserve
p343
aVof surgeons and CEO's,
p344
aVbut also shop-girls \u2014 yeah.
p345
aa(lp346
VBest Buy,
p347
aVthe consumer electronics company,
p348
aVgets all its employees \u2014
p349
aVthe cleaners, the shop assistants,
p350
aVthe people in the back office,
p351
aVnot just its forecasting team \u2014
p352
aVto place bets, yes bets,
p353
aVon things like whether or not
p354
aVa product is going to sell well before Christmas,
p355
aVon whether customers' new ideas
p356
aVare going to be or should be taken on by the company,
p357
aVon whether a project
p358
aVwill come in on time.
p359
aVBy leveraging
p360
aVand by embracing
p361
aVthe expertise within the company,
p362
aVBest Buy was able to discover, for example,
p363
aVthat the store that it was going to open in China \u2014
p364
aVits big, grand store \u2014
p365
aVwas not going to open on time.
p366
aVBecause when it asked its staff,
p367
aVall its staff, to place their bets
p368
aVon whether they thought the store would open on time or not,
p369
aVa group from the finance department
p370
aVplaced all their chips
p371
aVon that not happening.
p372
aVIt turned out that they were aware,
p373
aVas no one else within the company was,
p374
aVof a technological blip
p375
aVthat neither the forecasting experts,
p376
aVnor the experts on the ground in China,
p377
aVwere even aware of.
p378
aa(lp379
VThe strategies
p380
aVthat I have discussed this evening \u2014
p381
aVembracing dissent,
p382
aVtaking experts on,
p383
aVdemocratizing expertise,
p384
aVrebellious strategies \u2014
p385
aVare strategies that I think
p386
aVwould serve us all well to embrace
p387
aVas we try to deal with the challenges
p388
aVof these very confusing, complex,
p389
aVdifficult times.
p390
aVFor if we keep
p391
aVour independent decision-making part
p392
aVof our brains switched on,
p393
aVif we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,
p394
aVif we devolve authority,
p395
aVif we are rebellious,
p396
aVbut also
p397
aVif we become much more comfortable
p398
aVwith nuance,
p399
aVuncertainty and doubt,
p400
aVand if we allow our experts
p401
aVto express themselves
p402
aVusing those terms too,
p403
aVwe will set ourselves up
p404
aVmuch better
p405
aVfor the challenges of the 21st century.
p406
aVFor now, more than ever,
p407
aVis not the time
p408
aVto be blindly following,
p409
aVblindly accepting,
p410
aVblindly trusting.
p411
aVNow is the time to face the world
p412
aVwith eyes wide open \u2014
p413
aVyes, using experts
p414
aVto help us figure things out, for sure \u2014
p415
aVI don't want to completely do myself out of a job here \u2014
p416
aVbut being aware
p417
aVof their limitations
p418
aVand, of course, also our own.
