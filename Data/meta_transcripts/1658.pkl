VHuman beings start putting each other into boxes
p4
aVthe second that they see each other \u2014
p5
aVIs that person dangerous? Are they attractive?
p6
aVAre they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?
p7
aVWe do this little interrogation when we meet people
p8
aVto make a mental resume for them.
p9
aVWhat's your name? Where are you from?
p10
aVHow old are you? What do you do?
p11
aVThen we get more personal with it.
p12
aVHave you ever had any diseases?
p13
aVHave you ever been divorced?
p14
aVDoes your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?
p15
aVWhat are you into? Who are you into?
p16
aVWhat gender do you like to sleep with?
p17
aa(lp18
VI get it.
p19
aVWe are neurologically hardwired
p20
aVto seek out people like ourselves.
p21
aVWe start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough
p22
aVto know what acceptance feels like.
p23
aVWe bond together based on anything that we can \u2014
p24
aVmusic preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
p25
aVWe seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.
p26
aVSometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"
p27
aVcan feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box
p28
aVand asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
p29
aVBecause the categories, I've found, are too limiting.
p30
aVThe boxes are too narrow.
p31
aVAnd this can get really dangerous.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo here's a disclaimer about me, though,
p34
aVbefore we get too deep into this.
p35
aVI grew up in a very sheltered environment.
p36
aVI was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,
p37
aVtwo blocks from the epicenter of punk music.
p38
aVI was shielded from the pains of bigotry
p39
aVand the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.
p40
aVWhere I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker
p41
aVor a performance artist of some kind,
p42
aVyou were the weirdo.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVIt was an unorthodox upbringing,
p45
aVbut as a kid on the streets of New York,
p46
aVyou learn how to trust your own instincts,
p47
aVyou learn how to go with your own ideas.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
p50
aVI went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.
p51
aVThey said they wouldn't let girls play.
p52
aVSo I went home, and I shaved my head,
p53
aVand I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."
p54
aVI mean, who knows, right?
p55
aVWhen you're six, maybe you can do that.
p56
aVI didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.
p57
aVI kept up the charade for eight years.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo this is me when I was 11.
p60
aVI was playing a kid named Walter
p61
aVin a movie called "Julian Po."
p62
aVI was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
p63
aVSee, I was also a child actor,
p64
aVwhich doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,
p65
aVbecause no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.
p66
aVIn fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl \u2014
p67
aVnot my teachers at school, not my friends,
p68
aVnot the directors that I worked with.
p69
aVKids would often come up to me in class
p70
aVand grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple
p71
aVor grab my crotch to check what I was working with.
p72
aVWhen I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls
p73
aVso that it looked like I was peeing standing up.
p74
aVAt sleepovers I would have panic attacks
p75
aVtrying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me
p76
aVwithout outing myself.
p77
aa(lp78
VIt's worth mentioning though
p79
aVthat I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.
p80
aVI didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.
p81
aVI felt like I was performing this elaborate act.
p82
aVI wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
p83
aVIf my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,
p84
aVthey probably would have diagnosed me
p85
aVas something like gender dysmorphic
p86
aVand put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
p87
aVBut in my particular case,
p88
aVI just woke up one day when I was 14,
p89
aVand I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
p90
aVPuberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,
p91
aVand I was ready to figure out who I actually was.
p92
aa(lp93
VWhen a kid behaves like I did,
p94
aVthey don't exactly have to come out, right?
p95
aVNo one is exactly shocked.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVBut I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.
p98
aVWhen I was 15, and I called my father
p99
aVto tell him that I had fallen in love,
p100
aVit was the last thing on either of our minds
p101
aVto discuss what the consequences were
p102
aVof the fact that my first love was a girl.
p103
aVThree years later, when I fell in love with a man,
p104
aVneither of my parents batted an eyelash either.
p105
aVSee, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood
p106
aVthat I wasn't ever asked to define myself
p107
aVas any one thing at any point.
p108
aVI was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo four, almost five years ago,
p111
aVProposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,
p112
aVwas raising a lot of dust around this country.
p113
aVAnd at the time, getting married wasn't really something
p114
aVI spent a lot of time thinking about.
p115
aVBut I was struck by the fact that America,
p116
aVa country with such a tarnished civil rights record,
p117
aVcould be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.
p118
aVAnd I remember watching the discussion on television
p119
aVand thinking how interesting it was
p120
aVthat the separation of church and state
p121
aVwas essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,
p122
aVbetween places where people believed in it
p123
aVand places where people didn't.
p124
aVAnd then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.
p125
aa(lp126
VIf this was a war with two disparate sides,
p127
aVI, by default, fell on team gay,
p128
aVbecause I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.
p129
aVAt the time I was just beginning to emerge
p130
aVfrom this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag
p131
aVthat saw me go from being a boy
p132
aVto being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes
p133
aVto the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,
p134
aVover-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl
p135
aVto finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,
p136
aVa tomboyish girl
p137
aVwho liked both boys and girls depending on the person.
p138
aa(lp139
VI had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,
p140
aVwho fell kind of between-the-lines \u2014
p141
aVgirls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,
p142
aVgirls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,
p143
aVgirls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,
p144
aVgirls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls
p145
aVwho all hated being boxed in to anything.
p146
aVI loved these people, and I admired their freedom,
p147
aVbut I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble
p148
aVexploded into these raging debates
p149
aVwhere pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.
p150
aVAnd this powerful awareness rolled in over me
p151
aVthat I was a minority, and in my own home country,
p152
aVbased on one facet of my character.
p153
aVI was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.
p154
aa(lp155
VI was not an activist.
p156
aVI wave no flags in my own life.
p157
aVBut I was plagued by this question:
p158
aVHow could anyone vote to strip the rights
p159
aVof the vast variety of people that I knew
p160
aVbased on one element of their character?
p161
aVHow could they say that we as a group
p162
aVwere not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?
p163
aVWere we even a group? What group?
p164
aVAnd had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
p165
aVDid they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd then it occurred to me,
p168
aVperhaps if they could look into the eyes
p169
aVof the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship
p170
aVit might make it harder for them to do.
p171
aVIt might give them pause.
p172
aVObviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,
p173
aVso I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically
p174
aVwithout any artifice, without any lighting,
p175
aVor without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
p176
aVBecause in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers
p177
aVwithout the fear of him ripping your face off.
p178
aa(lp179
VFor me, photography is not just about exposing film,
p180
aVit's about exposing the viewer
p181
aVto something new, a place they haven't gone before,
p182
aVbut most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.
p183
aVLife magazine introduced generations of people
p184
aVto distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.
p185
aVSo I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,
p186
aVmugshots if you will.
p187
aVAnd I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country
p188
aVthat was not 100 percent straight,
p189
aVwhich, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VSo this was a very large undertaking,
p194
aVand to do it we needed some help.
p195
aVSo I ran out in the freezing cold,
p196
aVand I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to
p197
aVin February of about two years ago.
p198
aVAnd I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.
p199
aVAnd they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.
p200
aVAnd then we made this.

p206
aa(lp207
VSelf Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.
p208
aVMy aim is to take a simple portrait
p209
aVof anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight
p210
aVor feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.
p211
aVMy goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us
p212
aVthrough the simplicity of a face.
p213
aV(Music)
p214
aa(lp215
V"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."
p216
aVIt's written in the Declaration of Independence.
p217
aVWe are failing as a nation
p218
aVto uphold the morals upon which we were founded.
p219
aVThere is no equality in the United States.
p220
aa(lp221
V["What does equality mean to you?"]
p222
aV["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"]
p223
aV["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"]
p224
aa(lp225
VIt's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.
p226
aVThe fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
p227
aVToday in 29 states, more than half of this country,
p228
aVyou can legally be fired just for your sexuality.
p229
aa(lp230
V["Who is responsible for equality?"]
p231
aa(lp232
VI've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:
p233
aV"We are all responsible for equality."
p234
aVSo far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.
p235
aVAnd we wouldn't have been able to do any of it
p236
aVwithout the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.
p237
aVI want to take the project across the country.
p238
aVI want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.
p239
aVThis is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.
p240
aVI challenge you to look into the faces of these people
p241
aVand tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.
p242
aV(Music)
p243
aa(lp244
V["Self evident truths"]
p245
aV["4,000 faces across America"]

V(Music)
p248
aV(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
ViO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.
p251
aVAlmost 85,000 people watched that video,
p252
aVand then they started emailing us from all over the country,
p253
aVasking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.
p254
aVAnd a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.
p255
aVSo I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.
p256
aVThat video was made in the spring of 2011,
p257
aVand as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities
p258
aVand photographed almost 2,000 people.
p259
aa(lp260
VI know that this is a talk,
p261
aVbut I'd like to have a minute of just quiet
p262
aVand have you just look at these faces
p263
aVbecause there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.
p264
aVBecause if a picture is worth a thousand words,
p265
aVthen a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo after traveling and talking to people
p268
aVin places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,
p269
aVwe found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.
p270
aVVisibility really is key.
p271
aVFamiliarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.
p272
aVOnce an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,
p273
aVyou're far more likely to explore sympathy for it
p274
aVor explore a new perspective on it.
p275
aVOf course, in my travels I met people
p276
aVwho legally divorced their children for being other than straight,
p277
aVbut I also met people who were Southern Baptists
p278
aVwho switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
p279
aVSparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.
p280
aa(lp281
VBut here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:
p282
aVSelf Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.
p283
aVIn fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.
p284
aVIt presents, not just the complexities
p285
aVfound in a procession of different human beings,
p286
aVbut the complexities found within each individual person.
p287
aVIt wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.
p288
aa(lp289
VAt some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed,
p290
aVbecause there were a million different shades of gay.
p291
aVHere I was trying to help,
p292
aVand I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid \u2014
p293
aVyet another box.
p294
aVAt some point I added a question to the release form
p295
aVthat asked people to quantify themselves
p296
aVon a scale of one to 100 percent gay.
p297
aVAnd I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aVPeople didn't know what to do
p300
aVbecause they had never been presented with the option before.
p301
aVCan you quantify your openness?
p302
aa(lp303
VOnce they got over the shock, though,
p304
aVby and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent
p305
aVor the 3 to 20 percent marks.
p306
aVOf course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,
p307
aVbut I found that a much larger proportion of people
p308
aVidentified as something that was much more nuanced.
p309
aVI found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."
p310
aa(lp311
VLet me be clear though \u2014 and this is very important \u2014
p312
aVin no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.
p313
aVAnd I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,
p314
aVbecause if any of you happen to be of the belief
p315
aVthat sexual orientation is a choice,
p316
aVI invite you to go out and try to be grey.
p317
aVI'll take your picture just for trying.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVWhat I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.
p320
aVThe most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:
p321
aVIf you have gay people over here
p322
aVand you have straight people over here,
p323
aVand while we recognize that most people identify
p324
aVas somewhere closer to one binary or another,
p325
aVthere is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
p328
aVBecause, for example, if you pass a law
p329
aVthat allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,
p330
aVwhere exactly do you draw the line?
p331
aVIs it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?
p332
aVOr is it over here
p333
aVby the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?
p334
aVWhere exactly does one become a second-class citizen?
p335
aa(lp336
VAnother interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels
p337
aVis just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.
p338
aVAfter traveling so much and meeting so many people,
p339
aVlet me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts
p340
aVand Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens
p341
aVand every other polarization you can possibly think of
p342
aVwithin the LGBT community
p343
aVas there are within the human race.
p344
aVAside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,
p345
aVand once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,
p346
aVjust being other than straight
p347
aVdoesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,
p350
aVas it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,
p351
aVbus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,
p352
aVperhaps in watching this procession of humanity,
p353
aVsomething interesting and useful will begin to happen.
p354
aVHopefully these categories, these binaries,
p355
aVthese over-simplified boxes
p356
aVwill begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
p357
aVBecause really, they describe nothing that we see
p358
aVand no one that we know and nothing that we are.
p359
aVWhat we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.
p360
aVAnd seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.
p361
aVAt the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo is it me particularly
p364
aVthat you would choose to deny the right to housing,
p365
aVthe right to adopt children, the right to marriage,
p366
aVthe freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?
p367
aVAm I the one that you choose to disown
p368
aVas your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,
p369
aVyour neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,
p370
aVyour police woman or the fireman?
p371
aVIt's too late.
p372
aVBecause I already am all of those things.
p373
aVWe already are all of those things, and we always have been.
p374
aVSo please don't greet us as strangers,
p375
aVgreet us as your fellow human beings, period.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you.
