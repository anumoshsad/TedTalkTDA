VGood morning.
p4
aVLet's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.
p5
aVWe're all familiar with his fantastic work \u2014
p6
aVhis drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.
p7
aVBut we do not know his face.
p8
aVThousands of books have been written about him,
p9
aVbut there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.
p10
aVEven this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, what do you think?
p13
aVIs this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?
p14
aVLet's find out.
p15
aVLeonardo was a man that drew everything around him.
p16
aVHe drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.
p17
aVBut no faces?
p18
aVI find that hard to believe.
p19
aVHis contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here \u2014
p20
aVen face or three-quarters.
p21
aVSo, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo
p22
aVmust have made self-portraits from time to time.
p23
aVSo let's try to find them.
p24
aa(lp25
VI think that if we were to scan all of his work
p26
aVand look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.
p27
aVSo I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,
p28
aVand looked for male portraits.
p29
aVThere are about 120, you see them here.
p30
aVWhich ones of these could be self-portraits?
p31
aVWell, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.
p32
aVSo we can eliminate all the profiles.
p33
aVIt also has to be sufficiently detailed.
p34
aVSo we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.
p35
aVAnd we know from his contemporaries
p36
aVthat Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.
p37
aVSo we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd look what happens \u2014 only three candidates remain that fit the bill.
p41
aVAnd here they are.
p42
aVYes, indeed, the old man is there,
p43
aVas is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.
p44
aVAnd lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."
p45
aa(lp46
VBefore we go into these faces,
p47
aVI should explain why I have some right to talk about them.
p48
aVI've made more than 1,100 portraits myself
p49
aVfor newspapers, over the course of 300 \u2014 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVBut there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.
p52
aVSo I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.
p53
aVOK, now let's look at these three portraits.
p54
aVAnd hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,
p55
aVremark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,
p56
aVthe long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.
p57
aa(lp58
VI couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.
p59
aVThere is no reason why these portraits should look alike.
p60
aVAll we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,
p61
aVand look, they are very similar.
p62
aVNow, are they made in the right order?
p63
aVThe young man should be made first.
p64
aVAnd as you see here from the years that they were created,
p65
aVit is indeed the case.
p66
aVThey are made in the right order.
p67
aVWhat was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?
p68
aVYes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo we have three pictures, potentially of the same person
p71
aVof the same age as Leonardo at the time.
p72
aVBut how do we know it's him, and not someone else?
p73
aVWell, we need a reference.
p74
aVAnd here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.
p75
aVIt's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,
p76
aVfor which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.
p77
aVAnd if we now compare the face of the statue,
p78
aVwith the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
p79
aVThe statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo
p80
aVto those three faces.
p81
aa(lp82
VLadies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.
p83
aVIt's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.
p84
aVThe icon of icons finally has a face.
p85
aVHere he is: Leonardo da Vinci.
