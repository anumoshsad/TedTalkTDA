VMy name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.
p4
aVI've been making toys for the last 30 years.
p5
aVThe early '70s, I was in college.
p6
aVIt was a very revolutionary time.
p7
aVIt was a political ferment, so to say \u2014
p8
aVstudents out in the streets of Paris,
p9
aVrevolting against authority.
p10
aVAmerica was jolted
p11
aVby the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.
p12
aVIn India, we had the Naxalite movement,
p13
aVthe [unclear] movement.
p14
aVBut you know, when there is a political churning of society,
p15
aVit unleashes a lot of energy.
p16
aVThe National Movement of India
p17
aVwas testimony to that.
p18
aVLots of people resigned from well-paid jobs
p19
aVand jumped into the National Movement.
p20
aVNow in the early '70s,
p21
aVone of the great programs in India
p22
aVwas to revitalize
p23
aVprimary science in village schools.
p24
aa(lp25
VThere was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech
p26
aVand returned back as a molecular biologist
p27
aVin India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.
p28
aVAt 31, he was not able
p29
aVto relate the kind of [unclear] research,
p30
aVwhich he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.
p31
aVSo he designed and went and started a village science program.
p32
aVMany people were inspired by this.
p33
aVThe slogan of the early '70s
p34
aVwas "Go to the people.
p35
aVLive with them; love them.
p36
aVStart from what they know. Build on what they have."
p37
aVThis was kind of the defining slogan.
p38
aa(lp39
VWell I took one year.
p40
aVI joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.
p41
aVI worked there for two years,
p42
aVand I realized that I was not born to make trucks.
p43
aVOften one doesn't know what one wants to do,
p44
aVbut it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.
p45
aVSo I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.
p46
aVAnd it was a turning point.
p47
aVIt was a very small village \u2014
p48
aVa weekly bazaar
p49
aVwhere people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.
p50
aVSo I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."
p51
aVSo I just bought one specimen
p52
aVof everything which was sold on the roadside.
p53
aVAnd one thing which I found
p54
aVwas this black rubber.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis is called a cycle valve tube.
p57
aVWhen you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.
p58
aVAnd some of these models \u2014
p59
aVso you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,
p60
aVyou can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
p61
aVIt's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles \u2014
p62
aVan acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.
p63
aVIt's like its own little coupling.
p64
aVIf you have three of them, and you loop them together,
p65
aVwell you make a triangle.
p66
aVWith four, you make a square,
p67
aVyou make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,
p68
aVyou make all these kind of polygons.
p69
aVAnd they have some wonderful properties.
p70
aVIf you look at the hexagon, for instance,
p71
aVit's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
p72
aVYou can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.
p73
aVYou give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
p74
aVBut this is very shaky.
p75
aVLook at the pentagon, for instance,
p76
aVpull this out \u2014 it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
p77
aVPush it and it becomes house shaped.
p78
aVThis becomes an isosceles triangle \u2014
p79
aVagain, very shaky.
p80
aVThis square might look very square and prim.
p81
aVGive it a little push \u2014 this becomes a rhombus.
p82
aVIt becomes kite-shaped.
p83
aVBut give a child a triangle,
p84
aVhe can't do a thing to it.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhy use triangles?
p87
aVBecause triangles are the only rigid structures.
p88
aVWe can't make a bridge with squares
p89
aVbecause the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
p90
aVOrdinary people know about this
p91
aVbecause if you go to a village in India,
p92
aVthey might not have gone to engineering college,
p93
aVbut no one makes a roof placed like this.
p94
aVBecause if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.
p95
aVThey always make a triangular roof.
p96
aVNow this is people science.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd if you were to just poke a hole over here
p99
aVand put a third matchstick,
p100
aVyou'll get a T joint.
p101
aVAnd if I were to poke all the three legs of this
p102
aVin the three vertices of this triangle,
p103
aVI would make a tetrahedron.
p104
aVSo you make all these 3D shapes.
p105
aVYou make a tetrahedron like this.
p106
aVAnd once you make these,
p107
aVyou make a little house.
p108
aVPut this on top.
p109
aVYou can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.
p110
aVYou just need a ton.
p111
aVNow this was \u2014 you make a joint of six,
p112
aVyou make an icosahedron.
p113
aVYou can play around with it.
p114
aVThis makes an igloo.
p115
aVNow this is in 1978.
p116
aVI was a 24-year-old young engineer.
p117
aVAnd I thought this was so much better than making trucks.
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aVIf you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,
p120
aVyou simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.
p121
aVFour atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,
p122
aVwhich means the little carbon atom.
p123
aa(lp124
VWell since then,
p125
aVI just thought that I've been really privileged
p126
aVto go to over 2,000 schools in my country \u2014
p127
aVvillage schools, government schools,
p128
aVmunicipal schools, Ivy League schools \u2014
p129
aVI've been invited by most of them.
p130
aVAnd every time I go to a school,
p131
aVI see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
p132
aVI see hope. I see happiness in their faces.
p133
aVChildren want to make things. Children want to do things.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
p136
aVNow this is a little pump
p137
aVwith which you could inflate a balloon.
p138
aVIt's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
p139
aVAnd we have a slogan
p140
aVthat the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.
p141
aVSo all you do is \u2014
p142
aVit's a very kind of provocative statement \u2014
p143
aVthis old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]
p144
aVThis filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.
p145
aVAnd this is how you make a valve.
p146
aVYou put a little sticky tape.
p147
aVThis is one-way traffic.
p148
aVWell we make lots and lots of pumps.
p149
aVAnd this is the other one \u2014
p150
aVthat you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside
p151
aVand you make two half-cuts.
p152
aVNow this is what you do,
p153
aVis you bend both these legs into a triangle,
p154
aVand you just wrap some tape around.
p155
aVAnd this is the pump.
p156
aVAnd now, if you have this pump,
p157
aVit's like a great, great sprinkler.
p158
aVIt's like a centrifuge.
p159
aVIf you spin something, it tends to fly out.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VWell in terms of \u2014 if you were in Andhra Pradesh,
p164
aVyou would make this with the palmyra leaf.
p165
aVMany of our folk toys
p166
aVhave great science principles.
p167
aVIf you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
p168
aVIf I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.
p169
aVRight.
p170
aVThis is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.
p171
aVThere are four pictures.
p172
aVYou see insects,
p173
aVyou see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,
p174
aVfrogs, snakes, eagles.
p175
aVHere's a paper which you could [unclear] \u2014
p176
aVdesigned by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,
p177
aVArthur Stone,
p178
aVdocumented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.
p179
aVBut this is great fun for children.
p180
aVThey all study about the food chain.
p181
aVThe insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;
p182
aVthe snakes are eaten by the eagles.
p183
aVAnd this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper \u2014
p184
aVA4 size paper \u2014
p185
aVyou could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school \u2014
p186
aVa paper, a scale and a pencil \u2014 no glue, no scissors.
p187
aVIn three minutes, you just fold this up.
p188
aVAnd what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.
p189
aVIf you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.
p190
aVWith a bigger one, you make a bigger one.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow this is a pencil with a few slots over here.
p193
aVAnd you put a little fan here.
p194
aVAnd this is a hundred-year-old toy.
p195
aVThere have been six major research papers on this.
p196
aVThere's some grooves over here, you can see.
p197
aVAnd if I take a reed \u2014 if I rub this,
p198
aVsomething very amazing happens.
p199
aVSix major research papers on this.
p200
aVAs a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.
p201
aVHe wrote a paper on this.
p202
aVAnd you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider
p203
aVfor doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)
p204
aVThis is there for every child,
p205
aVand every child can enjoy this.
p206
aVIf you want to put a colored disk,
p207
aVwell all these seven colors coalesce.
p208
aVAnd this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,
p209
aVthat white light's made of seven colors,
p210
aVjust by spinning this around.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis is a straw.
p213
aVWhat we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,
p214
aVnipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,
p215
aVso there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.
p216
aVThis is a kind of a blowing straw.
p217
aVI just put this inside this.
p218
aVThere's a hole here, and I shut this.
p219
aVAnd this costs very little money to make \u2014
p220
aVgreat fun for children to do.
p221
aa(lp222
VWhat we do
p223
aVis make a very simple electric motor.
p224
aVNow this is the simplest motor on Earth.
p225
aVThe most expensive thing is the battery inside this.
p226
aVIf you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.
p227
aVThis is an old bicycle tube,
p228
aVwhich gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.
p229
aVThis is a permanent magnet.
p230
aVWhenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.
p231
aVIt's the interaction of both these magnets
p232
aVwhich makes this motor spin.
p233
aVWe made 30,000.
p234
aa(lp235
VTeachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,
p236
aVthey just muck up the definition and they spit it out.
p237
aVWhen teachers make it, children make it.
p238
aVYou can see a gleam in their eye.
p239
aVThey get a thrill
p240
aVof what science is all about.
p241
aVAnd this science is not a rich man's game.
p242
aVIn a democratic country,
p243
aVscience must reach to our most oppressed,
p244
aVto the most marginalized children.
p245
aVThis program started with 16 schools
p246
aVand spread to 1,500 government schools.
p247
aVOver 100,000 children learn science this way.
p248
aVAnd we're just trying to see possibilities.
p249
aa(lp250
VLook, this is the tetrapak \u2014
p251
aVawful materials from the point of view of the environment.
p252
aVThere are six layers \u2014 three layers of plastic, aluminum \u2014
p253
aVwhich are are sealed together.
p254
aVThey are fused together, so you can't separate them.
p255
aVNow you can just make a little network like this
p256
aVand fold them and stick them together
p257
aVand make an icosahedron.
p258
aVSo something which is trash,
p259
aVwhich is choking all the seabirds,
p260
aVyou could just recycle this into a very, very joyous \u2014
p261
aVall the platonic solids can be made with things like this.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis is a little straw,
p264
aVand what you do is you just nip two corners here,
p265
aVand this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.
p266
aVYou put this in your mouth, and you blow.
p267
aV(Honk)
p268
aVIt's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.
p269
aVYou're not able to see how the sound is produced,
p270
aVbecause the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
p271
aVI'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.
p272
aV(Honk)
p273
aVSo no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound
p274
aVwith wire vibrations.
p275
aVThe other is that you keep blowing at it,
p276
aVkeep making the sound,
p277
aVand you keep cutting it.
p278
aVAnd something very, very nice happens.
p279
aV(Honk)
p280
aV(Applause)
p281
aVAnd when you get a very small one \u2014
p282
aV(Honk)
p283
aVThis is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.
p284
aa(lp285
VWell before I go any further,
p286
aVthis is something worth sharing.
p287
aVThis is a touching slate meant for blind children.
p288
aVThis is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,
p289
aVand this is my drawing pen,
p290
aVwhich is basically a film box.
p291
aVIt's basically like a fisherman's line,
p292
aVa fishing line.
p293
aVAnd this is wool over here.
p294
aVIf I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.
p295
aVAnd what a blind child can do is to just draw this.
p296
aVWool sticks on Velcro.
p297
aVThere are 12 million blind children in our country \u2014
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aVwho live in a world of darkness.
p300
aVAnd this has come as a great boon to them.
p301
aVThere's a factory out there making our children blind,
p302
aVnot able to provide them with food,
p303
aVnot able to provide them with vitamin A.
p304
aVBut this has come as a great boon for them.
p305
aVThere are no patents. Anyone can make it.
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is very, very simple.
p308
aVYou can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.
p309
aVThese are two magnets.
p310
aVThis is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.
p311
aVSmall pulley and two strong magnets.
p312
aVAnd this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
p313
aVIf I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.
p314
aVThere will be a spinning magnetic field.
p315
aVLines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.
p316
aVAnd you can see, this LED is going to glow.
p317
aVSo this is a small crank generator.
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, this is, again,
p320
aVit's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.
p321
aVAnd what you can do
p322
aVis just, if you give it a twirl,
p323
aVwell they just keep going on.
p324
aVAnd imagine a bunch of kids
p325
aVstanding in a circle
p326
aVand just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.
p327
aVAnd they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.
p328
aa(lp329
VWell in the end, what we can also do:
p330
aVwe use a lot of old newspapers
p331
aVto make caps.
p332
aVThis is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
p333
aVIt's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)
p334
aVWhen first you see Nehru and Gandhi,
p335
aVthis is the Nehru cap \u2014 just half a newspaper.
p336
aVWe make lots of toys with newspapers,
p337
aVand this is one of them.
p338
aVAnd this is \u2014 you can see \u2014
p339
aVthis is a flapping bird.
p340
aVAll of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.
p341
aVAnd if you have one of these birds \u2014
p342
aVchildren in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.
p343
aVAnd you can see,
p344
aVthis is a little fantail bird.
p345
aa(lp346
VWell in the end, I'll just end with a story.
p347
aVThis is called "The Captain's Hat Story."
p348
aVThe captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
p349
aVIt goes very slowly.
p350
aVAnd there were lots of passengers on the ship,
p351
aVand they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.
p352
aV"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,
p353
aVand I'll provide you with good food and drinks."
p354
aVAnd the captain would wear a cap everyday
p355
aVand join in the regalia.
p356
aVThe first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,
p357
aVlike a captain's cap.
p358
aVThat night, when the passengers would be sleeping,
p359
aVhe would give it one more fold,
p360
aVand the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap \u2014
p361
aVwith a little shoot just like a designer cap,
p362
aVbecause it protects the spinal cord.
p363
aVAnd the second night, he would take the same cap
p364
aVand give it another fold.
p365
aVAnd the third day, it would be a Shikari cap \u2014
p366
aVjust like an adventurer's cap.
p367
aVAnd the third night, he would give it two more folds \u2014
p368
aVand this is a very, very famous cap.
p369
aVIf you've seen any of our Bollywood films,
p370
aVthis is what the policeman wears,
p371
aVit's called a zapalu cap.
p372
aVIt's been catapulted to international glory.
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
p375
aVSo that's a ship.
p376
aVAnd now the end:
p377
aVeveryone was enjoying the journey very much.
p378
aVThey were singing and dancing.
p379
aVSuddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
p380
aVAnd all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.
p381
aVA huge wave comes and slaps the front
p382
aVand knocks it down.
p383
aVAnd another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.
p384
aVAnd there's a third one over here.
p385
aVThis swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
p386
aVAnd the ship sinks,
p387
aVand the captain has lost everything,
p388
aVbut for a life jacket.
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you so much.
