VBack in 2003,
p4
aVthe UK government carried out a survey.
p5
aVAnd it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy
p6
aVin the population.
p7
aVAnd they were shocked to find out
p8
aVthat for every 100 working age adults in the country,
p9
aV47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.
p10
aVNow, Level 1 numeracy skills \u2014 that's low-end GCSE score.
p11
aVIt's the ability to deal with fractions, percentages and decimals.
p12
aVSo this figure prompted a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.
p13
aVPolicies were changed,
p14
aVinvestments were made,
p15
aVand then they ran the survey again in 2011.
p16
aVSo can you guess what happened to this number?
p17
aVIt went up to 49.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd in fact, when I reported this figure in the FT,
p22
aVone of our readers joked and said,
p23
aV"This figure is only shocking to 51 percent of the population."
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VBut I preferred, actually, the reaction of a schoolchild
p28
aVwhen I presented at a school this information,
p29
aVwho raised their hand and said,
p30
aV"How do we know that the person who made that number
p31
aVisn't one of the 49 percent either?"
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo clearly, there's a numeracy issue,
p36
aVbecause these are important skills for life,
p37
aVand a lot of the changes that we want to introduce in this century
p38
aVinvolve us becoming more comfortable with numbers.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, it's not just an English problem.
p41
aVOECD this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people,
p42
aVand leading the way, the USA \u2014
p43
aVnearly 40 percent of young people in the US have low numeracy.
p44
aVNow, England is there too,
p45
aVbut there are seven OECD countries with figures above 20 percent.
p46
aVThat is a problem, because it doesn't have to be that way.
p47
aVIf you look at the far end of this graph,
p48
aVyou can see the Netherlands and Korea are in single figures.
p49
aVSo there's definitely a numeracy problem that we want to address.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, as useful as studies like these are,
p52
aVI think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories;
p53
aVthat there are two kinds of people:
p54
aVthose people that are comfortable with numbers, that can do numbers,
p55
aVand the people who can't.
p56
aVAnd what I'm trying to talk about here today
p57
aVis to say that I believe that is a false dichotomy.
p58
aVIt's not an immutable pairing.
p59
aVI think you don't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy
p60
aVto be inspired by numbers,
p61
aVand that should be the starting point to the journey ahead.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd one of the ways in which we can begin that journey, for me,
p64
aVis looking at statistics.
p65
aVNow, I am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat
p66
aVof an image problem.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VIt's the part of mathematics
p71
aVthat even mathematicians don't particularly like,
p72
aVbecause whereas the rest of maths is all about precision and certainty,
p73
aVstatistics is almost the reverse of that.
p74
aVBut actually, I was a late convert to the world of statistics myself.
p75
aVIf you'd asked my undergraduate professors
p76
aVwhat two subjects would I be least likely to excel in after university,
p77
aVthey'd have told you statistics and computer programming,
p78
aVand yet here I am, about to show you some statistical graphics
p79
aVthat I programmed.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo what inspired that change in me?
p82
aVWhat made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing?
p83
aVIt's really because statistics are about us.
p84
aVIf you look at the etymology of the word statistics,
p85
aVit's the science of dealing with data
p86
aVabout the state or the community that we live in.
p87
aVSo statistics are about us as a group,
p88
aVnot us as individuals.
p89
aVAnd I think as social animals,
p90
aVwe share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups,
p91
aVto our peers.
p92
aVAnd statistics in this way are at their most powerful
p93
aVwhen they surprise us.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd there's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently
p96
aVby Ipsos MORI in the last few years.
p97
aVThey did a survey of over 1,000 adults in the UK,
p98
aVand said, for every 100 people in England and Wales,
p99
aVhow many of them are Muslim?
p100
aVNow the average answer from this survey,
p101
aVwhich was supposed to be representative of the total population, was 24.
p102
aVThat's what people thought.
p103
aVBritish people think 24 out of every 100 people in the country are Muslim.
p104
aVNow, official figures reveal that figure to be about five.
p105
aVSo there's this big variation between what we think, our perception,
p106
aVand the reality as given by statistics.
p107
aVAnd I think that's interesting.
p108
aVWhat could possibly be causing that misperception?
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd I was so thrilled with this study,
p111
aVI started to take questions out in presentations. I was referring to it.
p112
aVNow, I did a presentation
p113
aVat St. Paul's School for Girls in Hammersmith,
p114
aVand I had an audience rather like this,
p115
aVexcept it was comprised entirely of sixth-form girls.
p116
aVAnd I said, "Girls,
p117
aVhow many teenage girls do you think the British public think
p118
aVget pregnant every year?"
p119
aVAnd the girls were apoplectic when I said
p120
aVthe British public think that 15 out of every 100 teenage girls
p121
aVget pregnant in the year.
p122
aVAnd they had every right to be angry,
p123
aVbecause in fact, I'd have to have closer to 200 dots
p124
aVbefore I could color one in,
p125
aVin terms of what the official figures tell us.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd rather like numeracy, this is not just an English problem.
p128
aVIpsos MORI expanded the survey in recent years to go across the world.
p129
aVAnd so, they asked Saudi Arabians,
p130
aVfor every 100 adults in your country,
p131
aVhow many of them are overweight or obese?
p132
aVAnd the average answer from the Saudis was just over a quarter.
p133
aVThat's what they thought.
p134
aVJust over a quarter of adults are overweight or obese.
p135
aVThe official figures show, actually, it's nearer to three-quarters.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VSo again, a big variation.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I love this one: they asked in Japan, they asked the Japanese,
p142
aVfor every 100 Japanese people,
p143
aVhow many of them live in rural areas?
p144
aVThe average was about a 50-50 split, just over halfway.
p145
aVThey thought 56 out of every 100 Japanese people lived in rural areas.
p146
aVThe official figure is seven.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo extraordinary variations, and surprising to some,
p149
aVbut not surprising to people who have read the work
p150
aVof Daniel Kahneman, for example, the Nobel-winning economist.
p151
aVHe and his colleague, Amos Tversky, spent years researching this disjoint
p152
aVbetween what people perceive and the reality,
p153
aVthe fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians.
p154
aVAnd there are many reasons for this.
p155
aVIndividual experiences, certainly, can influence our perceptions,
p156
aVbut so, too, can things like the media reporting things by exception,
p157
aVrather than what's normal.
p158
aVKahneman had a nice way of referring to that.
p159
aVHe said, "We can be blind to the obvious" \u2014
p160
aVso we've got the numbers wrong \u2014
p161
aV"but we can be blind to our blindness about it."
p162
aVAnd that has enormous repercussions for decision making.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo at the statistics office while this was all going on,
p165
aVI thought this was really interesting.
p166
aVI said, this is clearly a global problem,
p167
aVbut maybe geography is the issue here.
p168
aVThese were questions that were all about, how well do you know your country?
p169
aVSo in this case, it's how well do you know 64 million people?
p170
aVNot very well, it turns out. I can't do that.
p171
aVSo I had an idea,
p172
aVwhich was to think about this same sort of approach
p173
aVbut to think about it in a very local sense.
p174
aVIs this a local?
p175
aVIf we reframe the questions and say,
p176
aVhow well do you know your local area,
p177
aVwould your answers be any more accurate?
p178
aa(lp179
VSo I devised a quiz:
p180
aVHow well do you know your area?
p181
aVIt's a simple Web app.
p182
aVYou put in a post code
p183
aVand then it will ask you questions based on census data
p184
aVfor your local area.
p185
aVAnd I was very conscious in designing this.
p186
aVI wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people,
p187
aVnot just the 49 percent who can get the numbers.
p188
aVI wanted everyone to engage with it.
p189
aVSo for the design of the quiz,
p190
aVI was inspired by the isotypes
p191
aVof Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.
p192
aVNow, these are methods for representing numbers
p193
aVusing repeating icons.
p194
aVAnd the numbers are there, but they sit in the background.
p195
aVSo it's a great way of representing quantity
p196
aVwithout resorting to using terms like "percentage,"
p197
aV"fractions" and "ratios."
p198
aa(lp199
VSo here's the quiz.
p200
aVThe layout of the quiz is,
p201
aVyou have your repeating icons on the left-hand side there,
p202
aVand a map showing you the area we're asking you questions about
p203
aVon the right-hand side.
p204
aVThere are seven questions.
p205
aVEach question, there's a possible answer between zero and a hundred,
p206
aVand at the end of the quiz,
p207
aVyou get an overall score between zero and a hundred.
p208
aVAnd so because this is TEDxExeter,
p209
aVI thought we would have a quick look at the quiz
p210
aVfor the first few questions of Exeter.
p211
aVAnd so the first question is:
p212
aVFor every 100 people, how many are aged under 16?
p213
aVNow, I don't know Exeter very well at all, so I had a guess at this,
p214
aVbut it gives you an idea of how this quiz works.
p215
aVYou drag the slider to highlight your icons,
p216
aVand then just click "Submit" to answer,
p217
aVand we animate away the difference between your answer and reality.
p218
aVAnd it turns out, I was a pretty terrible guess: five.
p219
aa(lp220
VHow about the next question?
p221
aVThis is asking about what the average age is,
p222
aVso the age at which half the population are younger
p223
aVand half the population are older.
p224
aVAnd I thought 35 \u2014 that sounds middle-aged to me.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VActually, in Exeter, it's incredibly young,
p229
aVand I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area.
p230
aVThe questions get harder as you go through.
p231
aVSo this one's now asking about homeownership:
p232
aVFor every 100 households, how many are owned with a mortgage or loan?
p233
aVAnd I hedged my bets here,
p234
aVbecause I didn't want to be more than 50 out on the answer.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd actually, these get harder, these questions,
p239
aVbecause when you're in an area, when you're in a community,
p240
aVthings like age \u2014 there are clues to whether a population is old or young.
p241
aVJust by looking around the area, you can see it.
p242
aVSomething like homeownership is much more difficult to see,
p243
aVso we revert to our own heuristics,
p244
aVour own biases about how many people we think own their own homes.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow the truth is, when we published this quiz,
p247
aVthe census data that it's based on was already a few years old.
p248
aVWe've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code
p249
aVand get statistics back for years.
p250
aVSo in some senses,
p251
aVthis was all a little bit old and not necessarily new.
p252
aVBut I was interested to see what reaction we might get
p253
aVby gamifying the data in the way that we have,
p254
aVby using animation
p255
aVand playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions.
p256
aa(lp257
VIt turns out, the reaction was, um ...
p258
aVwas more than I could have hoped for.
p259
aVIt was a long-held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website
p260
aVdue to public demand.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VThis URL contains the words "statistics," "gov" and "UK,"
p265
aVwhich are three of people's least favorite words in a URL.
p266
aVAnd the amazing thing about this was that the website came down
p267
aVat quarter to 10 at night,
p268
aVbecause people were actually engaging with this data
p269
aVof their own free will,
p270
aVusing their own personal time.
p271
aVI was very interested to see
p272
aVthat we got something like a quarter of a million people
p273
aVplaying the quiz within the space of 48 hours of launching it.
p274
aVAnd it sparked an enormous discussion online, on social media,
p275
aVwhich was largely dominated
p276
aVby people having fun with their misconceptions,
p277
aVwhich is something that I couldn't have hoped for any better,
p278
aVin some respects.
p279
aVI also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians.
p280
aVHow well do you know the area you claim to represent?
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd then just to finish,
p285
aVgoing back to the two kinds of people,
p286
aVI thought it would be really interesting to see
p287
aVhow people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz.
p288
aVThe national statistician of England and Wales, John Pullinger,
p289
aVyou would expect he would be pretty good.
p290
aVHe got 44 for his own area.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VJeremy Paxman \u2014 admittedly, after a glass of wine \u2014 36.
p295
aVEven worse.
p296
aVIt just shows you that the numbers can inspire us all.
p297
aVThey can surprise us all.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo very often, we talk about statistics
p300
aVas being the science of uncertainty.
p301
aVMy parting thought for today is:
p302
aVactually, statistics is the science of us.
p303
aVAnd that's why we should be fascinated by numbers.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you very much.
