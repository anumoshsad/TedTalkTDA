VWhen we think of games, there's all kinds of things.
p4
aVMaybe you're ticked off, or maybe, you're looking forward to a new game.
p5
aVYou've been up too late playing a game.
p6
aVAll these things happen to me.
p7
aVBut when we think about games,
p8
aVa lot of times we think about stuff like this:
p9
aVfirst-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games,
p10
aVor maybe you're a Facebook game player.
p11
aVThis is one my partner and I worked on.
p12
aVMaybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.
p13
aVThis is a lighter form of game.
p14
aVMaybe you think about the tragically boring board games
p15
aVthat hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.
p16
aVThis would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out.
p17
aVOr maybe you're in your living room,
p18
aVplaying with the Wii with the kids,
p19
aVand there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.
p20
aVI make my living from games, I've been lucky enough to do this
p21
aVsince I was 15, which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable,
p24
aVbut let's just think about this.
p25
aVSo this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.
p26
aVNow I don't know where you guys were,
p27
aVbut I was in my living room.
p28
aVIt was practically a religious event.
p29
aVAnd this is when the Americans beat the Russians,
p30
aVand this was \u2014 yes, it was technically a game.
p31
aVHockey is a game.
p32
aVBut really, was this a game?
p33
aVI mean, people cried.
p34
aVI've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aVAnd so this was an amazing experience.
p38
aa(lp39
VOr, if anybody here is from Boston \u2014
p40
aVSo when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series
p41
aVafter I believe, 351 years \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
Vwhen they won the World Series, it was amazing.
p46
aVI happened to be living in Springfield at the time,
p47
aVand the best part of it was,
p48
aVyou would close the women's door in the bathroom,
p49
aVand I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?
p50
aVOr the houses, you'd come out, because every game,
p51
aVwell, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?
p52
aVSo we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on in the whole block.
p53
aVAnd kids \u2014 the attendance was down in school,
p54
aVkids weren't going to school, but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?
p55
aVI mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox,
p56
aVand we know where they're stacked.
p57
aVSo this was an amazing experience,
p58
aVand again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles,
p59
aVpeople didn't say, "You know, really, I can die now, because the Red Sox won."
p60
aVAnd many people did.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo games, it means something more to us.
p63
aVIt absolutely means something more.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo now, this is an abrupt transition here.
p66
aVThere was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.
p67
aVI was the head of a college department teaching games,
p68
aVso, again, it was sort of a real job,
p69
aVand now I got to talk about making them as opposed to making them.
p70
aVPart of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department,
p71
aVis to eat, and I did that very well \u2014
p72
aVand so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson.
p73
aVSo this is Zig in this photograph, this is also one of Zig's photographs.
p74
aVHe's a photographer.
p75
aVAnd he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself,
p76
aVand you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation.
p77
aVAnd this particular shot \u2014
p78
aVthis is one of the more traditional shots.
p79
aVThis is a rain dancer.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd this is one of my favorite shots here.
p82
aVSo you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.
p83
aVThis is an expression of culture, right?
p84
aVAnd this is actually from his Degradation series.
p85
aVAnd what was most fascinating to me about this series
p86
aVis just, look at that little boy there, can you imagine?
p87
aVWe can see that's a traditional Native American.
p88
aVNow I just want to change that guy's race.
p89
aVJust imagine if that's a black guy.
p90
aVSo, "Honey, come here, let's get you a picture with the black guy." Right?
p91
aVLike, seriously, nobody would do this.
p92
aVIt baffles the mind.
p93
aVAnd so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind.
p94
aVHis favorite photograph \u2014
p95
aVmy favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here \u2014
p96
aVis Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I happen to be at dinner with this photographer,
p101
aVand he was talking with another photographer
p102
aVabout a shooting that had occurred,
p103
aVand it was on an Indian Reservation.
p104
aVHe'd taken his camera up there to photograph it,
p105
aVbut when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it.
p106
aVHe just couldn't capture the picture.
p107
aVAnd so they were talking back and forth about this question.
p108
aVDo you take the picture or not?
p109
aVAnd that was fascinating to me as a game designer,
p110
aVbecause it never occurs to me,
p111
aVshould I make the game about this difficult topic or not?
p112
aVBecause we just make things that are fun
p113
aVor will make you feel fear, that visceral excitement.
p114
aVBut every other medium does it.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo this is my kid.
p117
aVThis is Maezza, and when she was seven years old,
p118
aVshe came home from school one day,
p119
aVand like I do every single day, I asked her, "What did you do today?"
p120
aVSo she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black,
p123
aVand I knew this day was coming.
p124
aVI wasn't expecting it at seven, I don't know why, but I wasn't.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"
p127
aVSo she proceeded to tell me,
p128
aVand so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
p129
aV"The ships start in England, they come down from England,
p130
aVthey go to Africa, they go across the ocean \u2014
p131
aVthat's the Middle Passage part \u2014
p132
aVthey come to America, where the slaves are sold," she's telling me.
p133
aVBut Abraham Lincoln was elected president,
p134
aVand then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation,
p135
aVand now they're free.
p136
aa(lp137
VPause for about 10 seconds.
p138
aa(lp139
V"Can I play a game, Mommy?"
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I thought, that's it? And so, you know,
p142
aVthis is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event,
p143
aVand she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise,
p144
aVthis is more or less how it sounds to her.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd so, to me, I wanted more value in this,
p149
aVso when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so I happened to have all of these little pieces.
p154
aVI'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.
p155
aVI said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these,
p156
aVand I tell her to paint them in different families.
p157
aVThese are pictures of Maezza when she was \u2014
p158
aVGod, it still chokes me up seeing these.
p159
aVSo she's painting her little families.
p160
aVSo then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
p161
aVThis was the boat, it was made quickly, obviously.
p162
aVAnd so the basic gist of it is, I grabbed a bunch of families,
p163
aVand she's like, "Mommy, but you forgot the pink baby
p164
aVand you forgot the blue daddy
p165
aVand you forgot all these other things."
p166
aVAnd she says, "They want to go."
p167
aVAnd I said, "Honey, no, they don't want to go.
p168
aVThis is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."
p169
aVSo she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother,
p170
aVand as we're going across the ocean, following these rules,
p171
aVshe realizes that she's rolling pretty high,
p172
aVand she says to me, "We're not going to make it."
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd she realizes, we don't have enough food,
p175
aVand so she asks what to do,
p176
aVand I say \u2014 remember, she's seven \u2014
p177
aV"We can either put some people in the water
p178
aVor we can hope that they don't get sick
p179
aVand we make it to the other side."
p180
aVJust the look on her face came over \u2014
p181
aVnow mind you this is after a month of \u2014
p182
aVthis is Black History Month, right?
p183
aVAfter a month, she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
p184
aVAnd I said, "Yes." And so she said \u2014
p185
aVthis is her brother and sister \u2014
p186
aV"If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone."
p187
aV"Yes."
p188
aV"But I'd get to see them in America."
p189
aV"No."
p190
aV"But what if I saw them? Couldn't we stay together?"
p191
aV"So Daddy could be gone."
p192
aV"Yes."
p193
aVShe was fascinated by this, and she started to cry,
p194
aVI started to cry, her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.
p195
aVHe didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd so, we made this game, and she got it.
p198
aVShe got it because she spent time with these people.
p199
aVIt wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.
p202
aVThis is the game, which I've ended up calling "The New World,"
p203
aVbecause I like the phrase.
p204
aVI don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting
p205
aVto the people who were brought over on slave ships.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut when this happened, I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.
p208
aVI'd been making games for 20-some years,
p209
aVand then I decided to do it again.
p210
aVMy history is Irish.
p211
aVSo this is a game called "Síochán Leat." It's "peace be with you."
p212
aVIt's the entire history of my family in a single game.
p213
aa(lp214
VI made another game called "Train."
p215
aVI was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics,
p216
aVand if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover,
p217
aVand I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.
p220
aVThis is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.
p221
aVI was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.
p222
aVIt's the same thing.
p223
aVI'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd the one I'm working on right now, which is \u2014
p226
aVbecause I'm right in the middle of it,
p227
aVand these for some reason choke me up like crazy \u2014
p228
aVis a game called "Mexican Kitchen Workers."
p229
aVAnd originally, it was a math problem, more or less.
p230
aVHere's the economics of illegal immigration.
p231
aVAnd the more I learned about Mexican culture \u2014
p232
aVmy partner is Mexican \u2014 the more I learned that,
p233
aVyou know, for all of us, food is a basic need,
p234
aVand it is obviously with Mexicans, too, but it's much more than that.
p235
aVIt's an expression of love. It's an expression of \u2014
p236
aVGod, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.
p237
aVI'll look away from the picture.
p238
aVIt's an expression of beauty, it's how they say they love you.
p239
aVIt's how they say they care,
p240
aVand you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother
p241
aVwithout saying "food" in the first sentence.
p242
aVAnd so to me, this beautiful culture,
p243
aVthis beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics,
p246
aVit changes our perceptions about those people in topics,
p247
aVand it changes ourselves.
p248
aVWe change as people through games,
p249
aVbecause we're involved, and we're playing,
p250
aVand we're learning as we do so.
p251
