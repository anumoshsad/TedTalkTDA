VMelati Wijsen: Bali \u2014 island of gods.
p4
aa(lp5
VIsabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
p6
aa(lp7
VMW: Or ...
p8
aVa paradise lost.
p9
aVBali:
p10
aVisland of garbage.
p11
aa(lp12
VIW: In Bali,
p13
aVwe generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day.
p14
aVThat's about a 14-story building.
p15
aVAnd when it comes to plastic bags,
p16
aVless than five percent gets recycled.
p17
aa(lp18
VMW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island.
p19
aVIt changed ours, too, when we learned about it,
p20
aVwhen we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains
p21
aVand then in our rivers
p22
aVand then in our ocean.
p23
aVAnd those that don't even make it to the ocean,
p24
aVthey're either burned or littered.
p25
aa(lp26
VIW: So we decided to do something about it.
p27
aVAnd we've been working for almost three years now
p28
aVto try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.
p29
aVAnd we have had some significant successes.
p30
aa(lp31
VMW: We are sisters,
p32
aVand we go to the best school on earth:
p33
aVGreen School, Bali.
p34
aVGreen School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo,
p35
aVbut also in the way that it teaches.
p36
aVWe are taught to become leaders of today,
p37
aVsomething a normal textbook cannot match.
p38
aa(lp39
VIW: One day we had a lesson in class
p40
aVwhere we learned about significant people,
p41
aVlike Nelson Mandela,
p42
aVLady Diana
p43
aVand Mahatma Gandhi.
p44
aVWalking home that day,
p45
aVwe agreed that we also wanted to be significant.
p46
aVWhy should we wait until we were grown up
p47
aVto be significant?
p48
aVWe wanted to do something now.
p49
aa(lp50
VMW: Sitting on the sofa that night,
p51
aVwe brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.
p52
aVAnd one thing that stood out to us the most
p53
aVwas the plastic garbage.
p54
aVBut that is a huge problem.
p55
aVSo we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids:
p56
aVplastic bags.
p57
aVAnd the idea was born.
p58
aa(lp59
VIW: We started researching,
p60
aVand let's just say, the more we learned,
p61
aVthere was nothing good about plastic bags.
p62
aVAnd you know what?
p63
aVWe don't even need them.
p64
aa(lp65
VMW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags
p66
aVin many other places,
p67
aVfrom Hawaii to Rwanda
p68
aVand to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.
p69
aa(lp70
VIW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."
p71
aVMW: In the years that we have been campaigning,
p72
aVwe have learned a lot.
p73
aa(lp74
VLesson number one:
p75
aVyou cannot do it all by yourself.
p76
aVYou need a big team of like-minded kids,
p77
aVand so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.
p78
aVThe volunteer team includes children from all over the island,
p79
aVfrom both international and local schools.
p80
aVAnd together with them,
p81
aVwe started a multi-layered approach,
p82
aVbased on an on- and off-line signature petition,
p83
aVeducational and inspirational presentations at schools
p84
aVand we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.
p85
aVAnd last but not least,
p86
aVwe distribute alternative bags,
p87
aVbags like net bags,
p88
aVrecycled newspaper bags
p89
aVor 100 percent organic material bags,
p90
aVall made by local initiatives on the island.
p91
aa(lp92
VIW: We run a pilot village,
p93
aVhome of 800 families.
p94
aVThe village mayor was our first friend
p95
aVand he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.
p96
aVWe focused on making the customers aware,
p97
aVbecause that's where the change needs to happen.
p98
aVThe village is already two-thirds along the way
p99
aVof becoming plastic bag free.
p100
aa(lp101
VOur first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed.
p102
aVSo we thought,
p103
aV"Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures.
p104
aVThey can't ignore us, right?"
p105
aa(lp106
VMW: Right!
p107
aa(lp108
VIW: But, who would have guessed
p109
aVone million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VWe got stuck \u2014
p114
aVtill we learned lesson number two:
p115
aVthink outside the box.
p116
aVSomeone mentioned
p117
aVthat the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
p118
aa(lp119
VMW: But how do we get into the airport?
p120
aVAnd here comes lesson number three:
p121
aVpersistence.
p122
aVOff we headed to the airport.
p123
aVWe got past the janitor.
p124
aVAnd then it was his boss's boss,
p125
aVand then the assistant office manager,
p126
aVand then the office manager,
p127
aVand then ...
p128
aVwe got shuffled down two levels and thought,
p129
aVwell, here comes the janitor again.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd after several days knocking on doors
p132
aVand just being kids on a mission,
p133
aVwe finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports.
p134
aVAnd we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man,
p135
aVhe said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say,
p136
aVbut I'm going to give authorization
p137
aVto collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VIW: In our first hour and a half there,
p144
aVwe got almost 1,000 signatures.
p145
aVHow cool is that?
p146
aa(lp147
VLesson number four:
p148
aVyou need champions at all levels of society,
p149
aVfrom students to commercial managers to famous people.
p150
aVAnd thanks to the attraction of Green School,
p151
aVwe had access to a steady stream of celebrities.
p152
aVBan Ki Moon taught us
p153
aVthat Secretary-Generals of the United Nations
p154
aVdon't sign petitions \u2014
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
Veven if kids ask nicely.
p159
aVBut he promised to spread the word,
p160
aVand now we work closely with the United Nations.
p161
aa(lp162
VMW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network.
p163
aVShe started with just one Roots & Shoots group
p164
aVand now she has 4,000 groups around the world.
p165
aVWe are one of them.
p166
aVShe's a real inspiration.
p167
aa(lp168
VIf you're a fellow Rotarian,
p169
aVnice to meet you.
p170
aVWe're Interactors,
p171
aVthe youngest department of Rotary International.
p172
aa(lp173
VIW: But we have also learned much about patience,
p174
aa(lp175
VMW: how to deal with frustrations,
p176
aa(lp177
VIW: leadership,
p178
aa(lp179
VMW: teamwork,
p180
aa(lp181
VIW: friendship,
p182
aa(lp183
VMW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture
p184
aa(lp185
VIW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.
p186
aa(lp187
VMW: It's not always easy.
p188
aVSometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.
p189
aa(lp190
VIW: But last year, we did exactly that.
p191
aVWe went to India to give a talk,
p192
aVand our parents took us to visit
p193
aVthe former private house of Mahatma Gandhi.
p194
aVWe learned about the power of hunger strikes
p195
aVhe did to reach his goals.
p196
aVYes, by the end of the tour,
p197
aVwhen we met our parents again,
p198
aVwe both made a decision and said,
p199
aV"We're going on a hunger strike!"
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VMW: And you can probably imagine their faces.
p204
aVIt took a lot of convincing,
p205
aVand not only to our parents
p206
aVbut to our friends and to our teachers as well.
p207
aVIsabel and I were serious about doing this.
p208
aVSo we met with a nutritionist,
p209
aVand we came up with a compromise
p210
aVof not eating from sunrise to sunset every day
p211
aVuntil the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us
p212
aVto talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.
p213
aa(lp214
VIW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,
p215
aVstarted.
p216
aVWe used social media to support our goal
p217
aVand already on day two,
p218
aVpolice started to come to our home and school.
p219
aVWhat were these two girls doing?
p220
aVWe knew we weren't making the governor look his best
p221
aVby doing this food strike \u2014
p222
aVwe could have gone to jail.
p223
aVBut, hey, it worked.
p224
aVTwenty-four hours later,
p225
aVwe were picked up from school
p226
aVand escorted to the office of the governor.
p227
aa(lp228
VMW: And there he was \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
Vwaiting for us to meet and speak,
p233
aVbeing all supportive and thankful for our willingness
p234
aVto care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.
p235
aa(lp236
VHe signed a promise
p237
aVto help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags.
p238
aVAnd we are now friends,
p239
aVand on a regular basis,
p240
aVwe remind him and his team of the promises he has made.
p241
aVAnd indeed,
p242
aVrecently he stated and committed
p243
aVthat Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VIW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters
p248
aVis planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
p249
aa(lp250
VMW: Stop handing out free plastic bags
p251
aVand bring in your own reusable bag
p252
aVis our next message to change that mindset of the public.
p253
aa(lp254
VIW: Our short-term campaign,
p255
aV"One Island / One Voice,"
p256
aVis all about this.
p257
aVWe check and recognize the shops and restaurants
p258
aVthat have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone,
p259
aVand we put this sticker at their entrance
p260
aVand publish their names on social media
p261
aVand some important magazines on Bali.
p262
aVAnd conversely,
p263
aVthat highlights those who do not have the sticker.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VMW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this?
p268
aVWell, partly, it is because we are proud
p269
aVof the results that, together with our team,
p270
aVwe have been able to reach.
p271
aVBut also because along the way,
p272
aVwe have learned that kids can do things.
p273
aVWe can make things happen.
p274
aVIsabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old
p275
aVwhen we started this.
p276
aVWe never had a business plan,
p277
aVnor a fixed strategy,
p278
aVnor any hidden agendas \u2014
p279
aVjust the idea in front of us
p280
aVand a group of friends working with us.
p281
aVAll we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags
p282
aVfrom wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home.
p283
aVKids have a boundless energy
p284
aVand a motivation to be the change the world needs.
p285
aa(lp286
VIW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world:
p287
aVgo for it!
p288
aVMake that difference.
p289
aVWe're not telling you it's going to be easy.
p290
aVWe're telling you it's going to be worth it.
p291
aVUs kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population,
p292
aVbut we are 100 percent of the future.
p293
aa(lp294
VMW: We still have a lot of work to do,
p295
aVbut know that we still not stop
p296
aVuntil the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be
p297
aa(lp298
VBoth: "Welcome to Bali,
p299
aVdo you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VOm shanti shanti shanti om.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.
