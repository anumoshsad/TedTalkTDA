VI want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth.
p4
aVThink of the planet like a human body that we inhabit.
p5
aVThe skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways,
p6
aVbridges and tunnels, air and seaports
p7
aVthat enable our mobility across the continents.
p8
aVThe vascular system that powers the body
p9
aVare the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids.
p10
aVthat distribute energy.
p11
aVAnd the nervous system of communications
p12
aVis the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks
p13
aVand data centers that allow us to share information.
p14
aa(lp15
VThis ever-expanding infrastructural matrix
p16
aValready consists of 64 million kilometers of roads,
p17
aVfour million kilometers of railways,
p18
aVtwo million kilometers of pipelines
p19
aVand one million kilometers of Internet cables.
p20
aVWhat about international borders?
p21
aVWe have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders.
p22
aa(lp23
VLet's build a better map of the world.
p24
aVAnd we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology.
p25
aVThere's a saying with which all students of history are familiar:
p26
aV"Geography is destiny."
p27
aVSounds so grave, doesn't it?
p28
aVIt's such a fatalistic adage.
p29
aVIt tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor,
p30
aVthat small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors,
p31
aVthat vast distances are insurmountable.
p32
aVBut every journey I take around the world,
p33
aVI see an even greater force sweeping the planet:
p34
aVconnectivity.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe global connectivity revolution, in all of its forms \u2014
p37
aVtransportation, energy and communications \u2014
p38
aVhas enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people,
p39
aVof goods, of resources, of knowledge,
p40
aVsuch that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it.
p41
aVIn fact, I view the two forces as fusing together
p42
aVinto what I call "connectography."
p43
aa(lp44
VConnectography represents a quantum leap
p45
aVin the mobility of people, resources and ideas,
p46
aVbut it is an evolution,
p47
aVan evolution of the world from political geography,
p48
aVwhich is how we legally divide the world,
p49
aVto functional geography,
p50
aVwhich is how we actually use the world,
p51
aVfrom nations and borders, to infrastructure and supply chains.
p52
aa(lp53
VOur global system is evolving
p54
aVfrom the vertically integrated empires of the 19th century,
p55
aVthrough the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century,
p56
aVinto a global network civilization in the 21st century.
p57
aVConnectivity, not sovereignty,
p58
aVhas become the organizing principle of the human species.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VWe are becoming this global network civilization
p63
aVbecause we are literally building it.
p64
aVAll of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together
p65
aVtotal just under two trillion dollars per year.
p66
aVMeanwhile, our global infrastructure spending
p67
aVis projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year
p68
aVwithin the coming decade.
p69
aVAnd, well, it should.
p70
aVWe have been living off an infrastructure stock
p71
aVmeant for a world population of three billion,
p72
aVas our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion
p73
aVand eventually nine billion and more.
p74
aVAs a rule of thumb, we should spend about one trillion dollars
p75
aVon the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world.
p76
aa(lp77
VNot surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.
p78
aVIn 2015, China announced the creation
p79
aVof the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,
p80
aVwhich together with a network of other organizations
p81
aVaims to construct a network of iron and silk roads,
p82
aVstretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd as all of this topographical engineering unfolds,
p85
aVwe will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next 40 years,
p86
aVwe will build more infrastructure in the next 40 years,
p87
aVthan we have in the past 4,000 years.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow let's stop and think about it for a minute.
p90
aVSpending so much more on building the foundations of global society
p91
aVrather than on the tools to destroy it
p92
aVcan have profound consequences.
p93
aVConnectivity is how we optimize the distribution
p94
aVof people and resources around the world.
p95
aVIt is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts.
p96
aVI believe that is what is happening.
p97
aa(lp98
VConnectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century:
p99
aVplanetary urbanization.
p100
aVCities are the infrastructures that most define us.
p101
aVBy 2030, more than two thirds of the world's population
p102
aVwill live in cities.
p103
aVAnd these are not mere little dots on the map,
p104
aVbut they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere we are in Vancouver,
p107
aVat the head of the Cascadia Corridor
p108
aVthat stretches south across the US border to Seattle.
p109
aVThe technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley
p110
aVbegins north of San Francisco down to San Jose
p111
aVand across the bay to Oakland.
p112
aVThe sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego
p113
aVacross the Mexican border to Tijuana.
p114
aVSan Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal
p115
aVwhere you can exit into either country.
p116
aVEventually, a high-speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine.
p117
aVAmerica's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York
p118
aVand Philadelphia to Washington.
p119
aVIt contains more than 50 million people
p120
aVand also has plans for a high-speed rail network.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together.
p123
aVThis continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka
p124
aVcontains more than 80 million people
p125
aVand most of Japan's economy.
p126
aVIt is the world's largest megacity.
p127
aVFor now.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut in China, megacity clusters are coming together
p130
aVwith populations reaching 100 million people.
p131
aVThe Bohai Rim around Beijing,
p132
aVThe Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai
p133
aVand the Pearl River Delta,
p134
aVstretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou.
p135
aVAnd in the middle,
p136
aVthe Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,
p137
aVwhose geographic footprint is almost the same size
p138
aVas the country of Austria.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd any number of these megacity clusters
p141
aVhas a GDP approaching two trillion dollars \u2014
p142
aVthat's almost the same as all of India today.
p143
aVSo imagine if our global diplomatic institutions, such as the G20,
p144
aVwere to base their membership on economic size
p145
aVrather than national representation.
p146
aVSome Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table,
p147
aVwhile entire countries, like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.
p148
aa(lp149
VMoving to India, whose population will soon exceed that of China,
p150
aVit too has a number of megacity clusters,
p151
aVsuch as the Delhi Capital Region
p152
aVand Mumbai.
p153
aVIn the Middle East,
p154
aVGreater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population.
p155
aVMost of Egypt's 80 million people
p156
aVlive in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria.
p157
aVAnd in the gulf, a necklace of city-states is forming,
p158
aVfrom Bahrain and Qatar,
p159
aVthrough the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then there's Lagos,
p162
aVAfrica's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub.
p163
aVIt has plans for a rail network
p164
aVthat will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,
p165
aVstretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,
p166
aVto Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut these countries are suburbs of Lagos.
p169
aVIn a megacity world,
p170
aVcountries can be suburbs of cities.
p171
aVBy 2030, we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.
p172
aVSo which map tells you more?
p173
aVOur traditional map of 200 discrete nations
p174
aVthat hang on most of our walls,
p175
aVor this map of the 50 megacity clusters?
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd yet, even this is incomplete
p178
aVbecause you cannot understand any individual megacity
p179
aVwithout understanding its connections to the others.
p180
aVPeople move to cities to be connected,
p181
aVand connectivity is why these cities thrive.
p182
aVAny number of them, such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,
p183
aVhas a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half
p184
aVof their entire national GDP.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut equally importantly,
p187
aVyou cannot calculate any of their individual value
p188
aVwithout understanding the role of the flows of people,
p189
aVof finance, of technology
p190
aVthat enable them to thrive.
p191
aVTake the Gauteng province of South Africa,
p192
aVwhich contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.
p193
aVIt too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP.
p194
aVBut equally importantly, it is home to the offices
p195
aVof almost every single multinational corporation
p196
aVthat invests directly into South Africa
p197
aVand indeed, into the entire African continent.
p198
aa(lp199
VCities want to be part of global value chains.
p200
aVThey want to be part of this global division of labor.
p201
aVThat is how cities think.
p202
aVI've never met a mayor who said to me,
p203
aV"I want my city to be cut off."
p204
aVThey know that their cities belong as much
p205
aVto the global network civilization as to their home countries.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, for many people, urbanization causes great dismay.
p208
aVThey think cities are wrecking the planet.
p209
aVBut right now,
p210
aVthere are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving.
p211
aVThat is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations
p212
aVthat we have.
p213
aVAnd all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose,
p214
aVmankind's number one priority in the 21st century:
p215
aVsustainable urbanization.
p216
aa(lp217
VIs it working?
p218
aVLet's take climate change.
p219
aVWe know that summit after summit in New York and Paris
p220
aVis not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
p221
aVBut what we can see is that transferring technology
p222
aVand knowledge and policies between cities
p223
aVis how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies.
p224
aa(lp225
VCities are learning from each other.
p226
aVHow to install zero-emissions buildings,
p227
aVhow to deploy electric car-sharing systems.
p228
aVIn major Chinese cities,
p229
aVthey're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets.
p230
aVIn many Western cities,
p231
aVyoung people don't even want to drive anymore.
p232
aVCities have been part of the problem,
p233
aVnow they are part of the solution.
p234
aa(lp235
VInequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization.
p236
aVWhen I travel through megacities from end to end \u2014
p237
aVit takes hours and days \u2014
p238
aVI experience the tragedy of extreme disparity
p239
aVwithin the same geography.
p240
aVAnd yet, our global stock of financial assets
p241
aVhas never been larger,
p242
aVapproaching 300 trillion dollars.
p243
aVThat's almost four times the actual GDP of the world.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis,
p246
aVbut have we invested them in inclusive growth?
p247
aVNo, not yet.
p248
aVOnly when we build sufficient, affordable public housing,
p249
aVwhen we invest in robust transportation networks
p250
aVto allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally,
p251
aVthat's when our divided cities and societies
p252
aVwill come to feel whole again.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd that is why infrastructure has just been included
p257
aVin the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
p258
aVbecause it enables all the others.
p259
aVOur political and economic leaders
p260
aVare learning that connectivity is not charity,
p261
aVit's opportunity.
p262
aVAnd that's why our financial community needs to understand
p263
aVthat connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, cities can make the world more sustainable,
p266
aVthey can make the world more equitable,
p267
aVI also believe that connectivity between cities
p268
aVcan make the world more peaceful.
p269
aVIf we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders,
p270
aVwe see more trade, more investment
p271
aVand more stability.
p272
aVWe all know the story of Europe after World War II,
p273
aVwhere industrial integration kicked off a process
p274
aVthat gave rise to today's peaceful European Union.
p275
aVAnd you can see that Russia, by the way,
p276
aVis the least connected of major powers in the international system.
p277
aVAnd that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today.
p278
aVCountries that have less stake in the system
p279
aValso have less to lose in disturbing it.
p280
aVIn North America, the lines that matter most on the map
p281
aVare not the US-Canada border or the US-Mexico border,
p282
aVbut the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines
p283
aVand electricity grids and even water canals
p284
aVthat are forming an integrated North American union.
p285
aVNorth America does not need more walls, it needs more connections.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VBut the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world.
p290
aVAll of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary
p291
aVand where generations of leaders
p292
aVhave had hostile relations with each other.
p293
aVBut now a new group of leaders has come into power
p294
aVand is burying the hatchet.
p295
aa(lp296
VLet's take Southeast Asia, where high-speed rail networks
p297
aVare planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore
p298
aVand trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar.
p299
aVNow this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources
p300
aVand its industrial output.
p301
aVIt is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana,
p302
aVa peace among Southeast Asian nations.
p303
aa(lp304
VA similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa,
p305
aVwhere a half dozen countries
p306
aVare investing in railways and multimodal corridors
p307
aVso that landlocked countries can get their goods to market.
p308
aVNow these countries coordinate their utilities
p309
aVand their investment policies.
p310
aVThey, too, are evolving into a Pax Africana.
p311
aa(lp312
VOne region we know could especially use this kind of thinking
p313
aVis the Middle East.
p314
aVAs Arab states tragically collapse,
p315
aVwhat is left behind but the ancient cities,
p316
aVsuch as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?
p317
aVIn fact, the nearly 400 million people of the Arab world
p318
aVare almost entirely urbanized.
p319
aVAs societies, as cities,
p320
aVthey are either water rich or water poor,
p321
aVenergy rich or energy poor.
p322
aVAnd the only way to correct these mismatches
p323
aVis not through more wars and more borders,
p324
aVbut through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals.
p325
aVSadly, this is not yet the map of the Middle East.
p326
aVBut it should be,
p327
aVa connected Pax Arabia,
p328
aVinternally integrated
p329
aVand productively connected to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow, it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now
p332
aVtowards the world's most turbulent region.
p333
aVBut we know from history that more connectivity is the only way
p334
aVto bring about stability in the long run.
p335
aVBecause we know that in region after region,
p336
aVconnectivity is the new reality.
p337
aVCities and countries are learning to aggregate
p338
aVinto more peaceful and prosperous wholes.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut the real test is going to be Asia.
p341
aVCan connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry
p342
aVamong the great powers of the Far East?
p343
aVAfter all, this is where World War III is supposed to break out.
p344
aVSince the end of the Cold War, a quarter century ago,
p345
aVat least six major wars have been predicted for this region.
p346
aVBut none have broken out.
p347
aa(lp348
VTake China and Taiwan.
p349
aVIn the 1990s, this was everyone's leading World War III scenario.
p350
aVBut since that time,
p351
aVthe trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense
p352
aVthat last November,
p353
aVleaders from both sides held a historic summit
p354
aVto discuss eventual peaceful reunification.
p355
aVAnd even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan
p356
aVthat's pro-independence earlier this year
p357
aVdoes not undermine this fundamental dynamic.
p358
aa(lp359
VChina and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry
p360
aVand have been deploying their air forces and navies
p361
aVto show their strength in island disputes.
p362
aVBut in recent years,
p363
aVJapan has been making its largest foreign investments in China.
p364
aVJapanese cars are selling in record numbers there.
p365
aVAnd guess where the largest number of foreigners
p366
aVresiding in Japan today comes from?
p367
aVYou guessed it: China.
p368
aa(lp369
VChina and India have fought a major war
p370
aVand have three outstanding border disputes,
p371
aVbut today India is the second largest shareholder
p372
aVin the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
p373
aVThey're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India
p374
aVthrough Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China.
p375
aVTheir trade volume has grown from 20 billion dollars a decade ago
p376
aVto 80 billion dollars today.
p377
aa(lp378
VNuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars
p379
aVand continue to dispute Kashmir,
p380
aVbut they're also negotiating a most-favored-nation trade agreement
p381
aVand want to complete a pipeline
p382
aVstretching from Iran through Pakistan to India.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd let's talk about Iran.
p385
aVWasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable?
p386
aVThen why is every single major power rushing to do business there today?
p387
aa(lp388
VLadies and gentlemen,
p389
aVI cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out.
p390
aVBut we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet.
p391
aVEven though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries,
p392
aVthese same countries are also investing billions of dollars
p393
aVin each other's infrastructure and supply chains.
p394
aVThey are more interested in each other's functional geography
p395
aVthan in their political geography.
p396
aVAnd that is why their leaders think twice, step back from the brink,
p397
aVand decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo often it seems like the world is falling apart,
p400
aVbut building more connectivity
p401
aVis how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again,
p402
aVmuch better than before.
p403
aVAnd by wrapping the world
p404
aVin such seamless physical and digital connectivity,
p405
aVwe evolve towards a world
p406
aVin which people can rise above their geographic constraints.
p407
aVWe are the cells and vessels
p408
aVpulsing through these global connectivity networks.
p409
aa(lp410
VEveryday, hundreds of millions of people go online
p411
aVand work with people they've never met.
p412
aVMore than one billion people cross borders every year,
p413
aVand that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade.
p414
aa(lp415
VWe don't just build connectivity,
p416
aVwe embody it.
p417
aVWe are the global network civilization,
p418
aVand this is our map.
p419
aVA map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny.
p420
aVInstead, the future has a new and more hopeful motto:
p421
aVconnectivity is destiny.
p422
