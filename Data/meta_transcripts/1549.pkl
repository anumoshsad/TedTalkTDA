VI've got a great idea that's going to change the world.
p4
aVIt's fantastic, it's going to blow your mind.
p5
aVIt's my beautiful baby.
p6
aVHere's the thing: everybody loves a beautiful baby.
p7
aVI mean, I was a beautiful baby.
p8
aVHere's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo in the world of product design,
p11
aVthe beautiful baby's like the concept car.
p12
aVIt's the knockout.
p13
aVYou see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!"
p14
aVSo why is it that this year's new cars
p15
aVlook pretty much exactly like last year's new cars?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VWhat went wrong between the design studio and the factory?
p20
aVToday, I don't want to talk about beautiful babies,
p21
aVI want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design \u2014
p22
aVthose sort of dorky teenage years
p23
aVwhere you're trying to figure out how the world works.
p24
aa(lp25
VI'm going to start with an example
p26
aVfrom some work that we did on newborn health.
p27
aVSo here's a problem:
p28
aVfour million babies around the world, mostly in developing countries,
p29
aVdie every year before their first birthday,
p30
aVeven before their first month of life.
p31
aVIt turns out half of those kids,
p32
aVor about 1.8 million newborns around the world,
p33
aVwould make it if you could just keep them warm
p34
aVfor the first three days, maybe the first week.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu, Nepal.
p37
aVAll of these kids in blankets belong in incubators \u2014
p38
aVsomething like this.
p39
aVThis is a donated Japanese Atom incubator
p40
aVthat we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.
p41
aVThis is what we want.
p42
aVProbably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment
p43
aVand donated their old stuff to Nepal.
p44
aVThe problem is, without technicians, without spare parts,
p45
aVdonations like this very quickly turn into junk.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo this seemed like a problem that we could do something about.
p48
aVKeeping a baby warm for a week \u2014 that's not rocket science.
p49
aVSo we got started.
p50
aVWe partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston.
p51
aVWe conducted months of user research overseas,
p52
aVtrying to think like designers, human-centered design \u2014
p53
aV"Let's figure out what people want."
p54
aVWe killed thousands of Post-it notes.
p55
aVWe made dozens of prototypes to get to this.
p56
aVSo this is the NeoNurture infant incubator,
p57
aVand this has a lot of smarts built into it, and we felt great.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo the idea here is, unlike the concept car,
p60
aVwe want to marry something beautiful
p61
aVwith something that actually works.
p62
aVAnd our idea is that this design
p63
aVwould inspire manufacturers and other people of influence
p64
aVto take this model and run with it.
p65
aa(lp66
VHere's the bad news:
p67
aVthe only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator
p68
aVwas this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot.
p69
aVSo recognition is fantastic.
p70
aVWe want design to get out for people to see it.
p71
aVIt won lots of awards.
p72
aVBut it felt like a booby prize.
p73
aVWe wanted to make beautiful things
p74
aVthat are going to make the world a better place,
p75
aVand I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo it turns out that design  for inspiration doesn't really ...
p78
aVI guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do,
p79
aVit's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective.
p80
aVSo, really, I want to design for outcomes.
p81
aVI don't want to make beautiful stuff; I want to make the world a better place.
p82
aVSo when we were designing NeoNurture,
p83
aVwe paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing,
p84
aVfor example, poor families, rural doctors,
p85
aVoverloaded nurses, even repair technicians.
p86
aVWe thought we had all our bases covered, we'd done everything right.
p87
aa(lp88
VWell, it turns out there's this whole constellation of people
p89
aVwho have to be involved in a product for it to be successful:
p90
aVmanufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation.
p91
aVMichael Free at PATH says you have to figure out
p92
aVwho will "choose, use and pay the dues"
p93
aVfor a product like this.
p94
aVAnd I have to ask the question that VCs always ask:
p95
aV"Sir, what is your business, and who is your customer?"
p96
aa(lp97
VWho is our customer?
p98
aVWell, here's an example.
p99
aVThis is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility.
p100
aVIt turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment.
p101
aVThose decisions are made by the Ministry of Health
p102
aVor by foreign donors,
p103
aVand it just kind of shows up.
p104
aVSimilarly, here's a multinational medical-device manufacturer.
p105
aVIt turns out they've got to fish where the fish are.
p106
aVSo it turns out that in emerging markets \u2014 where the fish are \u2014
p107
aVare the emerging middle class of these countries \u2014
p108
aVdiseases of affluence: heart disease, infertility.
p109
aVSo it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect
p110
aVreally means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.
p111
aVOK, that was an important lesson.
p112
aa(lp113
VSecond, we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.
p114
aVSo we started by finding a manufacturer,
p115
aVan organization called MTTS in Vietnam,
p116
aVthat manufactures newborn-care technologies for Southeast Asia.
p117
aVOur other partner is East Meets West,
p118
aVan American foundation that distributes that technology
p119
aVto poor hospitals around that region.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo we started with them, saying, "Well, what do you want?
p122
aVWhat's a problem you want to solve?"
p123
aVAnd they said, "Let's work on newborn jaundice."
p124
aVSo this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.
p125
aVJaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.
p126
aVOf those newborns, one in 10 roughly,
p127
aVif it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe
p128
aVthat it leads to either a life-long disability,
p129
aVor the kids could even die.
p130
aVThere's one way to treat jaundice,
p131
aVand that's what's called an exchange transfusion.
p132
aVSo as you can imagine, that's expensive and a little bit dangerous.
p133
aa(lp134
VThere is another cure.
p135
aVIt's very technological, it's very complex, a little daunting.
p136
aVYou've got to shine blue light on the kid.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.
p141
aVHow is this a hard problem?
p142
aVI went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo here's an example.
p147
aVThis is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals,
p148
aVand here's how it's supposed to be used.
p149
aVIt's over the baby, illuminating a single patient.
p150
aVTake it out of an American hospital,
p151
aVsend it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia,
p152
aVhere's how it's actually used.
p153
aVThe effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity.
p154
aVThese dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy.
p155
aVHere's what it looks like under actual use.
p156
aVSo those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy.
p157
aVBut without training, without some kind of light meter,
p158
aVhow would you know?
p159
aa(lp160
VWe see other examples of problems like this.
p161
aVHere's a neonatal intensive care unit,
p162
aVwhere moms come in to visit their babies.
p163
aVAnd keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C-section,
p164
aVso that's already kind of a bummer.
p165
aVMom's visiting her kid.
p166
aVShe sees her baby naked, lying under some blue lights,
p167
aVlooking kind of vulnerable.
p168
aVIt's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby.
p169
aVFrom a phototherapy standpoint, maybe not the best behavior.
p170
aVIn fact, that sounds kind of dumb.
p171
aVExcept, what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user \u2014
p172
aVthere are only dumb products.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe have to think like existentialists:
p175
aVit's not the painting we would have painted,
p176
aVit's the painting that we actually painted.
p177
aVIt's the use \u2014 designed for actual use.
p178
aVHow are people actually going to use this?
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, similarly, when we think about our partner MTTS,
p181
aVthey've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses.
p182
aVSo here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.
p183
aVThey're inexpensive, really rugged.
p184
aVThey've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology.
p185
aVBut here's the problem:
p186
aVEvery doctor in the world, every hospital administrator,
p187
aVhas seen TV \u2014 curse those "ER" reruns!
p188
aVTurns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like.
p189
aVThey want Buck Rogers, they don't want effective.
p190
aVIt sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,
p191
aVbut there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment
p192
aVthan something that looks cheap and crummy.
p193
aVSo again, if we want people to trust a device,
p194
aVit has to look trustworthy.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo thinking about outcomes,
p197
aVit turns out appearances matter.
p198
aVWe took all that information together.
p199
aVWe tried, this time, to get it right.
p200
aVAnd here's what we developed.
p201
aVThis is the Firefly phototherapy device,
p202
aVexcept this time, we didn't stop at the concept car.
p203
aVFrom the very beginning, we started by talking to manufacturers.
p204
aVOur goal is to make a state-of-the-art product
p205
aVthat our partner MTTS can actually manufacture.
p206
aVOur goal is to study how they work, the resources they have access to,
p207
aVso that they can make this product.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo that's the design for manufacture question.
p210
aVWhen we think about actual use,
p211
aVyou'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
p212
aVIt only fits a single baby,
p213
aVand the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device.
p214
aVIf you try to put more than one kid in,
p215
aVyou're stacking them on top of each other.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong.
p220
aVIn other words, you want to make the right way to use it
p221
aVthe easiest way to use it.
p222
aVAnother example \u2014 again, silly Mom.
p223
aVSilly Mom thinks her baby looks cold, wants to put a blanket over the baby.
p224
aVThat's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly,
p225
aVso if Mom does put a blanket over the baby,
p226
aVit's still receiving effective phototherapy from below.
p227
aa(lp228
VLast story here:
p229
aVI've got a friend in India who told me
p230
aVthat you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology
p231
aVfor distribution in Asia,
p232
aVuntil you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee
p233
aVon every single little component on the inside.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VYou think it's funny.
p238
aVI had a laptop in the Peace Corps,
p239
aVand the screen had all these dead pixels on it.
p240
aVAnd one day I looked in \u2014 they were all dead ants
p241
aVthat had gotten into my laptop and perished.
p242
aVThose poor ants.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VSo with Firefly, what we did is \u2014 the problem is electronics get hot,
p247
aVand you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool \u2014
p248
aVin most products.
p249
aVWe decided we can't put a "Do not enter" sign next to the vent.
p250
aVWe actually got rid of all that stuff.
p251
aVSo Firefly's totally sealed.
p252
aa(lp253
VThese are the kinds of lessons \u2014
p254
aVas awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager,
p255
aVmuch worse to be a frustrated designer.
p256
aVSo I was thinking, "What I really want to do is change the world.
p257
aVI have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution.
p258
aVI have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device.
p259
aVI actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure.
p260
aa(lp261
VI have to think like an existentialist.
p262
aVI have to accept that there are no dumb users, only dumb products."
p263
aVWe have to ask ourselves hard questions.
p264
aVAre we designing for the world that we want?
p265
aVAre we designing for the world that we have?
p266
aVAre we designing for the world that's coming,
p267
aVwhether we're ready or not?
p268
aa(lp269
VI got into this business designing products.
p270
aVI've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world,
p271
aVyou have to design outcomes.
p272
aVAnd that's design that matters.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you.
