VIt was just an ordinary Saturday.
p4
aVMy dad was outside mowing the lawn,
p5
aVmy mom was upstairs folding laundry,
p6
aVmy sister was in her room doing homework
p7
aVand I was in the basement playing video games.
p8
aVAnd as I came upstairs to get something to drink,
p9
aVI looked out the window
p10
aVand realized that there was something that I was supposed to be doing,
p11
aVand this is what I saw.
p12
aa(lp13
VNo, this wasn't my family's dinner on fire.
p14
aVThis was my science project.
p15
aVFlames were pouring out,
p16
aVsmoke was in the air
p17
aVand it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire.
p18
aVI immediately started yelling.
p19
aVMy mom was freaking out,
p20
aVmy dad ran around to put out the fire
p21
aVand of course my sister started recording a Snapchat video.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VThis was just the beginning of my team's science project.
p26
aVMy team is composed of me and three other students
p27
aVwho are here in the audience today.
p28
aVWe competed in FIRST LEGO League
p29
aVwhich is an international LEGO robotics competition for kids,
p30
aVand in addition to a robotics game,
p31
aVwe also worked on a separate science project,
p32
aVand this was the project that we were working on.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo the idea for this project all started
p35
aVwhen a few months earlier,
p36
aVa couple of my teammates took a trip to Central America
p37
aVand saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,
p38
aVor expanded polystyrene foam.
p39
aVAnd when they came back and told us about it,
p40
aVwe really started thinking about the ways in which we see Styrofoam every day.
p41
aVGet a new flat-screen TV?
p42
aVYou end up with a block of Styrofoam bigger than the TV itself.
p43
aVDrink a cup of coffee?
p44
aVWell, those Styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up.
p45
aVAnd where do all these items go after their one-time use?
p46
aVSince there aren't any good existing solutions for used Styrofoam,
p47
aValmost all of them end up right in the landfill,
p48
aVor the oceans and beaches,
p49
aVtaking over 500 years to degrade.
p50
aVAnd in fact, every year, the US alone
p51
aVproduces over two billion pounds of Styrofoam,
p52
aVfilling up a staggering 25 percent of landfills.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo why do we have these ghost accumulations of Styrofoam waste?
p55
aVWhy can't we just recycle them like many plastics?
p56
aVWell, simply put, recycled polystyrene is too expensive
p57
aVand potentially contaminated,
p58
aVso there is very little market demand for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.
p59
aVAnd as a result, Styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material,
p60
aVbecause it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene.
p61
aVAnd in fact, many cities across the US
p62
aVhave even passed ordinances
p63
aVthat simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene,
p64
aVwhich includes disposable utensils,
p65
aVpacking peanuts, takeout containers
p66
aVand even plastic beach toys,
p67
aVall products that are very useful in today's society.
p68
aVAnd now France has become the first country
p69
aVto completely ban all plastic utensils,
p70
aVcups and plates.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut what if we could keep using Styrofoam
p73
aVand keep benefiting from its cheap, lightweight, insulating
p74
aVand excellent packing ability,
p75
aVwhile not having to suffer from the repercussions
p76
aVof having to dispose of it?
p77
aVWhat if we could turn it into something else that's actually useful?
p78
aVWhat if we could make the impossible possible?
p79
aa(lp80
VMy team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that's already in Styrofoam
p81
aVto create activated carbon,
p82
aVwhich is used in almost every water filter today.
p83
aVAnd activated carbon works by using very small micropores
p84
aVto filter out contaminants from water or even air.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo we started out by doing a variety of heating tests,
p87
aVand unfortunately, we had many failures.
p88
aVLiterally, nothing worked.
p89
aVBesides my dad's grill catching on fire,
p90
aVmost of our samples vaporized into nothing,
p91
aVor exploded inside expensive furnaces,
p92
aVleaving a horribly sticky mess.
p93
aVIn fact, we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo why did we keep trying
p96
aVwhen all the adults said it was impossible?
p97
aVWell, maybe it's because we're kids. We don't know any better.
p98
aVBut the truth is, we kept trying because we thought it was still possible.
p99
aVWe knew that if we were successful,
p100
aVwe would be helping the environment and making the world a better place.
p101
aVSo we kept trying
p102
aVand failing
p103
aVand trying
p104
aVand failing.
p105
aVWe were so ready to give up.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut then it happened.
p108
aVWith the right temperatures, times and chemicals,
p109
aVwe finally got that successful test result
p110
aVshowing us that we had created activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.
p111
aVAnd at that moment, the thing that had been impossible
p112
aVall of a sudden wasn't.
p113
aVIt showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning,
p114
aVwe were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted.
p115
aVAnd moreover, not only were we able to create activated carbon
p116
aVfor purifying water,
p117
aVbut we were also able to reduce Styrofoam waste,
p118
aVsolving two global problems with just one solution.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo from then on, we were inspired to take our project further,
p121
aVperforming more tests to make it more effective
p122
aVand testing it in real world situations.
p123
aVWe then proceeded to receive funding
p124
aVfrom the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION STEM-in-Action program
p125
aVsponsored by the US Army,
p126
aVas well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards
p127
aVsponsored by XPRIZE.
p128
aVAnd we were also honored
p129
aVwith the Scientific American Innovator Award
p130
aVfrom Google Science Fair.
p131
aVAnd using these funds, we plan to file a full patent on our process
p132
aVand to continue to work on our project.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo yes, although we started with catching my dad's grill on fire
p135
aVand failing so many times that we almost quit,
p136
aVit was well worth it when we look back at it now.
p137
aVWe took a problem that many people said was impossible
p138
aVand we made it possible,
p139
aVand we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work.
p140
aVWe learned that you can't have success
p141
aVwithout a little,
p142
aVor a lot, of failure.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo in the future, don't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames,
p145
aVbecause you never know when your idea might just catch fire.
p146
aa(lp147
VThank you.
