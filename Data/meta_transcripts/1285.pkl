VIf your life were a book
p4
aVand you were the author,
p5
aVhow would you want your story to go?
p6
aVThat's the question that changed my life forever.
p7
aVGrowing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,
p8
aVall I wanted was to be free.
p9
aVI would daydream about traveling the world,
p10
aVliving in a place where it snowed,
p11
aVand I would picture all of the stories
p12
aVthat I would go on to tell.
p13
aa(lp14
VAt the age of 19,
p15
aVthe day after I graduated high school,
p16
aVI moved to a place where it snowed
p17
aVand I became a massage therapist.
p18
aVWith this job all I needed were my hands
p19
aVand my massage table by my side
p20
aVand I could go anywhere.
p21
aVFor the first time in my life,
p22
aVI felt free, independent
p23
aVand completely in control of my life.
p24
aVThat is, until my life took a detour.
p25
aVI went home from work early one day
p26
aVwith what I thought was the flu,
p27
aVand less than 24 hours later
p28
aVI was in the hospital
p29
aVon life support
p30
aVwith less than a two percent chance of living.
p31
aVIt wasn't until days later
p32
aVas I lay in a coma
p33
aVthat the doctors diagnosed me
p34
aVwith bacterial meningitis,
p35
aVa vaccine-preventable blood infection.
p36
aVOver the course of two and a half months
p37
aVI lost my spleen, my kidneys,
p38
aVthe hearing in my left ear
p39
aVand both of my legs below the knee.
p40
aa(lp41
VWhen my parents wheeled me out of the hospital
p42
aVI felt like I had been pieced back together
p43
aVlike a patchwork doll.
p44
aVI thought the worst was over
p45
aVuntil weeks later when I saw my new legs
p46
aVfor the first time.
p47
aVThe calves were bulky blocks of metal
p48
aVwith pipes bolted together for the ankles
p49
aVand a yellow rubber foot
p50
aVwith a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle
p51
aVto look like a vein.
p52
aVI didn't know what to expect,
p53
aVbut I wasn't expecting that.
p54
aa(lp55
VWith my mom by my side
p56
aVand tears streaming down our faces,
p57
aVI strapped on these chunky legs
p58
aVand I stood up.
p59
aVThey were so painful and so confining
p60
aVthat all I could think was,
p61
aVhow am I ever going to travel the world
p62
aVin these things?
p63
aVHow was I ever going to live
p64
aVthe life full of adventure and stories,
p65
aVas I always wanted?
p66
aVAnd how was I going to snowboard again?
p67
aa(lp68
VThat day, I went home, I crawled into bed
p69
aVand this is what my life looked like
p70
aVfor the next few months:
p71
aVme passed out, escaping from reality,
p72
aVwith my legs resting by my side.
p73
aVI was absolutely physically and emotionally broken.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I knew that in order to move forward,
p76
aVI had to let go of the old Amy
p77
aVand learn to embrace the new Amy.
p78
aVAnd that is when it dawned on me
p79
aVthat I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.
p80
aVI could be as tall as I wanted!
p81
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p82
aVOr as short as I wanted, depending on who I was dating.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd if I snowboarded again,
p85
aVmy feet aren't going to get cold.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd best of all, I thought,
p88
aVI can make my feet the size of all the shoes
p89
aVthat are on the sales rack. (Laughter)
p90
aVAnd I did!
p91
aVSo there were benefits here.
p92
aa(lp93
VIt was this moment that I asked myself
p94
aVthat life-defining question:
p95
aVIf my life were a book
p96
aVand I were the author,
p97
aVhow would I want the story to go?
p98
aVAnd I began to daydream.
p99
aVI daydreamed like I did as a little girl
p100
aVand I imagined myself
p101
aVwalking gracefully,
p102
aVhelping other people through my journey
p103
aVand snowboarding again.
p104
aVAnd I didn't just see myself
p105
aVcarving down a mountain of powder,
p106
aVI could actually feel it.
p107
aVI could feel the wind against my face
p108
aVand the beat of my racing heart
p109
aVas if it were happening in that very moment.
p110
aVAnd that is when a new chapter in my life began.
p111
aa(lp112
VFour months later I was back up on a snowboard,
p113
aValthough things didn't go quite as expected:
p114
aVMy knees and my ankles wouldn't bend
p115
aVand at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift
p116
aVwhen I fell and my legs,
p117
aVstill attached to my snowboard \u2014
p118
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p119
aVwent flying down the mountain,
p120
aVand I was on top of the mountain still.
p121
aVI was so shocked,
p122
aVI was just as shocked as everybody else, and I was so discouraged,
p123
aVbut I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet
p124
aVthat I would be able to do this again.
p125
aVAnd this is when I learned that our borders
p126
aVand our obstacles can only do two things:
p127
aVone, stop us in our tracks
p128
aVor two, force us to get creative.
p129
aa(lp130
VI did a year of research, still couldn't figure out
p131
aVwhat kind of legs to use,
p132
aVcouldn't find any resources that could help me.
p133
aVSo I decided to make a pair myself.
p134
aVMy leg maker and I put random parts together
p135
aVand we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in.
p136
aVAs you can see,
p137
aVrusted bolts, rubber, wood and neon pink duct tape.
p138
aVAnd yes, I can change my toenail polish.
p139
aVIt was these legs
p140
aVand the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive \u2014
p141
aVa new kidney from my dad \u2014
p142
aVthat allowed me to follow my dreams again.
p143
aVI started snowboarding,
p144
aVthen I went back to work, then I went back to school.
p145
aa(lp146
VThen in 2005 I cofounded a nonprofit organization
p147
aVfor youth and young adults with physical disabilities
p148
aVso they could get involved with action sports.
p149
aVFrom there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,
p150
aVwhere I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet
p151
aVso they could attend school.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd just this past February,
p154
aVI won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals \u2014
p155
aV(Applause) \u2014
p156
aVwhich made me
p157
aVthe highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder
p158
aVin the world.
p159
aa(lp160
VEleven years ago, when I lost my legs,
p161
aVI had no idea what to expect.
p162
aVBut if you ask me today,
p163
aVif I would ever want to change my situation,
p164
aVI would have to say no.
p165
aVBecause my legs haven't disabled me,
p166
aVif anything they've enabled me.
p167
aVThey've forced me to rely on my imagination
p168
aVand to believe in the possibilities,
p169
aVand that's why I believe
p170
aVthat our imaginations can be used as tools
p171
aVfor breaking through borders,
p172
aVbecause in our minds, we can do anything
p173
aVand we can be anything.
p174
aa(lp175
VIt's believing in those dreams
p176
aVand facing our fears head-on
p177
aVthat allows us to live our lives
p178
aVbeyond our limits.
p179
aVAnd although today is about innovation without borders,
p180
aVI have to say that in my life,
p181
aVinnovation has only been possible
p182
aVbecause of my borders.
p183
aVI've learned that borders are where the actual ends,
p184
aVbut also where the imagination
p185
aVand the story begins.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo the thought that I would like  to challenge you with today
p188
aVis that maybe instead of looking at  our challenges and our limitations
p189
aVas something negative or bad,
p190
aVwe can begin to look at them as blessings,
p191
aVmagnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations
p192
aVand help us go further than we ever knew we could go.
p193
aVIt's not about breaking down borders.
p194
aVIt's about pushing off of them
p195
aVand seeing what amazing places
p196
aVthey might bring us.
p197
aVThank you.
