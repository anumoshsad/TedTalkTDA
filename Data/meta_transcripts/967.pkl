VWe live in in a remarkable time,
p4
aVthe age of genomics.
p5
aVYour genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
p6
aVYour sequence and mine are slightly different.
p7
aVThat's why we look different.
p8
aVI've got brown eyes;
p9
aVyou might have blue or gray.
p10
aVBut it's not just skin-deep.
p11
aVThe headlines tell us
p12
aVthat genes can give us scary diseases,
p13
aVmaybe even shape our personality,
p14
aVor give us mental disorders.
p15
aVOur genes seem to have
p16
aVawesome power over our destinies.
p17
aVAnd yet, I would like to think
p18
aVthat I am more than my genes.
p19
aVWhat do you guys think?
p20
aVAre you more than your genes?
p21
aV(Audience: Yes.) Yes?
p22
aVI think some people agree with me.
p23
aVI think we should make a statement.
p24
aVI think we should say it all together.
p25
aVAll right: "I'm more than my genes" \u2014 all together.
p26
aVEverybody: I am more than my genes.
p27
aV(Cheering)
p28
aVSebastian Seung: What am I?
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVI am my connectome.
p31
aVNow, since you guys are really great,
p32
aVmaybe you can humor me and say this all together too.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVRight. All together now.
p35
aVEverybody: I am my connectome.
p36
aVSS: That sounded great.
p37
aVYou know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is,
p38
aVand you're willing to play along with me.
p39
aVI could just go home now.
p40
aa(lp41
VWell, so far only one connectome is known,
p42
aVthat of this tiny worm.
p43
aVIts modest nervous system
p44
aVconsists of just 300 neurons.
p45
aVAnd in the 1970s and '80s,
p46
aVa team of scientists
p47
aVmapped all 7,000 connections
p48
aVbetween the neurons.
p49
aVIn this diagram, every node is a neuron,
p50
aVand every line is a connection.
p51
aVThis is the connectome
p52
aVof the worm C. elegans.
p53
aVYour connectome is far more complex than this
p54
aVbecause your brain
p55
aVcontains 100 billion neurons
p56
aVand 10,000 times as many connections.
p57
aVThere's a diagram like this for your brain,
p58
aVbut there's no way it would fit on this slide.
p59
aVYour connectome contains one million times more connections
p60
aVthan your genome has letters.
p61
aVThat's a lot of information.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat's in that information?
p64
aVWe don't know for sure, but there are theories.
p65
aVSince the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated
p66
aVthat maybe your memories \u2014
p67
aVthe information that makes you, you \u2014
p68
aVmaybe your memories are stored
p69
aVin the connections between your brain's neurons.
p70
aVAnd perhaps other aspects of your personal identity \u2014
p71
aVmaybe your personality and your intellect \u2014
p72
aVmaybe they're also encoded
p73
aVin the connections between your neurons.
p74
aVAnd so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:
p75
aVI am my connectome.
p76
aVI didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;
p77
aVI just want you to remember it.
p78
aVAnd in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,
p79
aVbecause we have never had technologies
p80
aVpowerful enough to test it.
p81
aVFinding that worm connectome
p82
aVtook over a dozen years of tedious labor.
p83
aVAnd to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,
p84
aVwe need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,
p85
aVthat will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
p86
aVAnd in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,
p87
aVwhich are currently under development
p88
aVin my lab and the labs of my collaborators.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.
p91
aVYou can recognize them instantly
p92
aVby their fantastic shapes.
p93
aVThey extend long and delicate branches,
p94
aVand in short, they look like trees.
p95
aVBut this is just a single neuron.
p96
aVIn order to find connectomes,
p97
aVwe have to see all the neurons at the same time.
p98
aVSo let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,
p99
aVwho works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman
p100
aVat Harvard University.
p101
aVBobby is holding fantastically thin slices
p102
aVof a mouse brain.
p103
aVAnd we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times
p104
aVto obtain the resolution,
p105
aVso that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.
p106
aVExcept, you still may not really recognize them,
p107
aVand that's because we have to work in three dimensions.
p108
aa(lp109
VIf we take many images of many slices of the brain
p110
aVand stack them up,
p111
aVwe get a three-dimensional image.
p112
aVAnd still, you may not see the branches.
p113
aVSo we start at the top,
p114
aVand we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,
p115
aVand we do that for the next slice
p116
aVand for the next slice.
p117
aVAnd we keep on doing that,
p118
aVslice after slice.
p119
aVIf we continue through the entire stack,
p120
aVwe can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape
p121
aVof a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.
p122
aVAnd we can do that for another neuron in green.
p123
aVAnd you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron
p124
aVat two locations,
p125
aVand these are what are called synapses.
p126
aa(lp127
VLet's zoom in on one synapse,
p128
aVand keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
p129
aVYou should see small circles \u2014
p130
aVthese are called vesicles.
p131
aVThey contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
p132
aVAnd so when the green neuron wants to communicate,
p133
aVit wants to send a message to the red neuron,
p134
aVit spits out neurotransmitter.
p135
aVAt the synapse, the two neurons
p136
aVare said to be connected
p137
aVlike two friends talking on the telephone.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo you see how to find a synapse.
p140
aVHow can we find an entire connectome?
p141
aVWell, we take this three-dimensional stack of images
p142
aVand treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.
p143
aVWe color every neuron in, in a different color,
p144
aVand then we look through all of the images,
p145
aVfind the synapses
p146
aVand note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
p147
aVIf we can do that throughout all the images,
p148
aVwe could find a connectome.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, at this point,
p151
aVyou've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
p152
aVAnd so I think we're ready to tackle
p153
aVone of the most important questions in neuroscience:
p154
aVhow are the brains of men and women different?
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVAccording to this self-help book,
p157
aVguys brains are like waffles;
p158
aVthey keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.
p159
aVGirls' brains are like spaghetti;
p160
aVeverything in their life is connected to everything else.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVYou guys are laughing,
p163
aVbut you know, this book changed my life.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVBut seriously, what's wrong with this?
p166
aVYou already know enough to tell me \u2014 what's wrong with this statement?
p167
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,
p168
aVeveryone's brains are like spaghetti.
p169
aVOr maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
p170
aVJust as one strand of spaghetti
p171
aVcontacts many other strands on your plate,
p172
aVone neuron touches many other neurons
p173
aVthrough their entangled branches.
p174
aVOne neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,
p175
aVbecause there can be synapses
p176
aVat these points of contact.
p177
aVBy now, you might have sort of lost perspective
p178
aVon how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.
p181
aVI assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.
p182
aVSo, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.
p183
aVAnd you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches
p184
aVare contained inside this cube.
p185
aVAnd a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
p186
aVAnd that's just a mouse brain \u2014
p187
aVit's a lot smaller than a human brain.
p188
aVSo when show my friends this,
p189
aVsometimes they've told me,
p190
aV"You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
p191
aVNeuroscience is hopeless."
p192
aVBecause if you look at a brain with your naked eye,
p193
aVyou don't really see how complex it is,
p194
aVbut when you use a microscope,
p195
aVfinally the hidden complexity is revealed.
p196
aa(lp197
VIn the 17th century,
p198
aVthe mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal,
p199
aVwrote of his dread of the infinite,
p200
aVhis feeling of insignificance
p201
aVat contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.
p202
aVAnd, as a scientist,
p203
aVI'm not supposed to talk about my feelings \u2014
p204
aVtoo much information, professor.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVBut may I?
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aV(Applause)
p209
aVI feel curiosity,
p210
aVand I feel wonder,
p211
aVbut at times I have also felt despair.
p212
aVWhy did I choose to study
p213
aVthis organ that is so awesome in its complexity
p214
aVthat it might well be infinite?
p215
aVIt's absurd.
p216
aVHow could we even dare to think
p217
aVthat we might ever understand this?
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
p220
aVAnd indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
p221
aVSomeday,
p222
aVa fleet of microscopes will capture
p223
aVevery neuron and every synapse
p224
aVin a vast database of images.
p225
aVAnd some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers
p226
aVwill analyze the images without human assistance
p227
aVto summarize them in a connectome.
p228
aVI do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,
p229
aVbecause finding an entire human connectome
p230
aVis one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.
p231
aVIt will take the work of generations to succeed.
p232
aVAt the present time, my collaborators and I,
p233
aVwhat we're aiming for is much more modest \u2014
p234
aVjust to find partial connectomes
p235
aVof tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
p236
aVBut even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis
p237
aVthat I am my connectome.
p238
aVFor now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,
p239
aVthat it's actually worth taking seriously.
p240
aa(lp241
VAs you grow during childhood
p242
aVand age during adulthood,
p243
aVyour personal identity changes slowly.
p244
aVLikewise, every connectome
p245
aVchanges over time.
p246
aVWhat kinds of changes happen?
p247
aVWell, neurons, like trees,
p248
aVcan grow new branches,
p249
aVand they can lose old ones.
p250
aVSynapses can be created,
p251
aVand they can be eliminated.
p252
aVAnd synapses can grow larger,
p253
aVand they can grow smaller.
p254
aVSecond question:
p255
aVwhat causes these changes?
p256
aVWell, it's true.
p257
aVTo some extent, they are programmed by your genes.
p258
aVBut that's not the whole story,
p259
aVbecause there are signals, electrical signals,
p260
aVthat travel along the branches of neurons
p261
aVand chemical signals
p262
aVthat jump across from branch to branch.
p263
aVThese signals are called neural activity.
p264
aVAnd there's a lot of evidence
p265
aVthat neural activity
p266
aVis encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,
p267
aVour mental experiences.
p268
aVAnd there's a lot of evidence that neural activity
p269
aVcan cause your connections to change.
p270
aVAnd if you put those two facts together,
p271
aVit means that your experiences
p272
aVcan change your connectome.
p273
aVAnd that's why every connectome is unique,
p274
aVeven those of genetically identical twins.
p275
aVThe connectome is where nature meets nurture.
p276
aVAnd it might true
p277
aVthat just the mere act of thinking
p278
aVcan change your connectome \u2014
p279
aVan idea that you may find empowering.
p280
aa(lp281
VWhat's in this picture?
p282
aVA cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
p283
aVWhat else is in this picture?
p284
aVDo not forget that groove in the Earth
p285
aVcalled the stream bed.
p286
aVWithout it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
p287
aVAnd with the stream,
p288
aVI would like to propose a metaphor
p289
aVfor the relationship between neural activity
p290
aVand connectivity.
p291
aVNeural activity is constantly changing.
p292
aVIt's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
p293
aVThe connections
p294
aVof the brain's neural network
p295
aVdetermines the pathways
p296
aValong which neural activity flows.
p297
aVAnd so the connectome is like bed of the stream;
p298
aVbut the metaphor is richer than that,
p299
aVbecause it's true that the stream bed
p300
aVguides the flow of the water,
p301
aVbut over long timescales,
p302
aVthe water also reshapes the bed of the stream.
p303
aVAnd as I told you just now,
p304
aVneural activity can change the connectome.
p305
aVAnd if you'll allow me to ascend
p306
aVto metaphorical heights,
p307
aVI will remind you that neural activity
p308
aVis the physical basis \u2014 or so neuroscientists think \u2014
p309
aVof thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
p310
aVAnd so we might even speak of
p311
aVthe stream of consciousness.
p312
aVNeural activity is its water,
p313
aVand the connectome is its bed.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo let's return from the heights of metaphor
p316
aVand return to science.
p317
aVSuppose our technologies for finding connectomes
p318
aVactually work.
p319
aVHow will we go about testing the hypothesis
p320
aV"I am my connectome?"
p321
aVWell, I propose a direct test.
p322
aVLet us attempt
p323
aVto read out memories from connectomes.
p324
aVConsider the memory
p325
aVof long temporal sequences of movements,
p326
aVlike a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
p327
aVAccording to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,
p328
aVsuch memories are stored
p329
aVas chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
p330
aVBecause, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,
p331
aVthrough their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,
p332
aVand so on down the line,
p333
aVlike a chain of falling dominoes.
p334
aVAnd this sequence of neural activation
p335
aVis hypothesized to be the neural basis
p336
aVof those sequence of movements.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo one way of trying to test the theory
p339
aVis to look for such chains
p340
aVinside connectomes.
p341
aVBut it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
p342
aVThey're going to be scrambled up.
p343
aVSo we'll have to use our computers
p344
aVto try to unscramble the chain.
p345
aVAnd if we can do that,
p346
aVthe sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling
p347
aVwill be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity
p348
aVthat is replayed in the brain during memory recall.
p349
aVAnd if that were successful,
p350
aVthat would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VWhat a mess \u2014
p355
aVhave you ever tried to wire up a system
p356
aVas complex as this?
p357
aVI hope not.
p358
aVBut if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.
p359
aVThe branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.
p360
aVCan anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?
p361
aVI'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVI estimate, millions of miles,
p364
aVall packed in your skull.
p365
aVAnd if you appreciate that number,
p366
aVyou can easily see
p367
aVthere is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.
p368
aVAnd indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,
p369
aV"Anorexic brains are wired differently,"
p370
aVor "Autistic brains are wired differently."
p371
aVThese are plausible claims,
p372
aVbut in truth,
p373
aVwe can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough
p374
aVto tell if these are really true.
p375
aVAnd so the technologies for seeing connectomes
p376
aVwill allow us to finally
p377
aVread mis-wiring of the brain,
p378
aVto see mental disorders in connectomes.
p379
aa(lp380
VSometimes the best way to test a hypothesis
p381
aVis to consider its most extreme implication.
p382
aVPhilosophers know this game very well.
p383
aVIf you believe that I am my connectome,
p384
aVI think you must also accept the idea
p385
aVthat death is the destruction
p386
aVof your connectome.
p387
aVI mention this because there are prophets today
p388
aVwho claim that technology
p389
aVwill fundamentally alter the human condition
p390
aVand perhaps even transform the human species.
p391
aVOne of their most cherished dreams
p392
aVis to cheat death
p393
aVby that practice known as cryonics.
p394
aVIf you pay 100,000 dollars,
p395
aVyou can arrange to have your body frozen after death
p396
aVand stored in liquid nitrogen
p397
aVin one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse,
p398
aVawaiting a future civilization
p399
aVthat is advanced to resurrect you.
p400
aa(lp401
VShould we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality,
p402
aVcalling them fools?
p403
aVOr will they someday chuckle
p404
aVover our graves?
p405
aVI don't know \u2014
p406
aVI prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.
p407
aVI propose that we attempt to find a connectome
p408
aVof a frozen brain.
p409
aVWe know that damage to the brain
p410
aVoccurs after death and during freezing.
p411
aVThe question is: has that damage erased the connectome?
p412
aVIf it has, there is no way that any future civilization
p413
aVwill be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.
p414
aVResurrection might succeed for the body,
p415
aVbut not for the mind.
p416
aVOn the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,
p417
aVwe cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
p418
aa(lp419
VI've described a quest
p420
aVthat begins in the world of the very small,
p421
aVand propels us to the world of the far future.
p422
aVConnectomes will mark a turning point in human history.
p423
aVAs we evolved from our ape-like ancestors
p424
aVon the African savanna,
p425
aVwhat distinguished us was our larger brains.
p426
aVWe have used our brains to fashion
p427
aVever more amazing technologies.
p428
aVEventually, these technologies will become so powerful
p429
aVthat we will use them to know ourselves
p430
aVby deconstructing and reconstructing
p431
aVour own brains.
p432
aVI believe that this voyage of self-discovery
p433
aVis not just for scientists,
p434
aVbut for all of us.
p435
aVAnd I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.
