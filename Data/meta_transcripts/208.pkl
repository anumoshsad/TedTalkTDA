V"Jó napot, pacák" Which, as somebody here must surely know,
p4
aVmeans "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,
p5
aVthat peculiar non-Indo-European language spoken by Hungarians
p6
aVfor which, given the fact that cognitive diversity is
p7
aVat least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet,
p8
aVfew would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago.
p9
aVBut there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"
p10
aVI said somebody here must surely know, because
p11
aVdespite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with,
p12
aVand the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop
p13
aVof Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life
p14
aVthere has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me.
p15
aVI even have dreams that take place in landscapes
p16
aVI recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films,
p17
aVespecially the early movies of Miklos Jancso.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, how do I explain this mysterious affinity?
p20
aVMaybe it's because my native state of South Carolina,
p21
aVwhich is not much smaller than present-day Hungary,
p22
aVonce imagined a future for itself as an independent country.
p23
aVAnd as a consequence of that presumption,
p24
aVmy hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army,
p25
aVan experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village
p26
aVthroughout its long and troubled history.
p27
aVOr maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '50s,
p28
aVmy uncle Henry \u2014 having denounced the Ku Klux Klan
p29
aVand been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard,
p30
aVliving under death threat \u2014 took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety
p31
aVand went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone.
p32
aVThat was a very Hungarian thing to do,
p33
aVas anyone will attest who remembers 1956.
p34
aVAnd of course, from time to time Hungarians
p35
aVhave invented their own equivalent of the Klan.
p36
aa(lp37
VWell, it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life
p38
aVis difficult to account for, but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration
p39
aVfor people with a complex moral awareness,
p40
aVwith a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado.
p41
aVIt's not a typical mindset for most Americans,
p42
aVbut it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians.
p43
aVSo, "Jó napot, pacák!"
p44
aa(lp45
VI went back to South Carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn
p46
aVat the tail end of the 1960s,
p47
aVwith the reckless condescension of that era
p48
aVthinking I would save my people.
p49
aVNever mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving.
p50
aVI labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before
p51
aVmaking my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina,
p52
aVa Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College.
p53
aVI knew nothing about Wofford
p54
aVand even less about Methodism,
p55
aVbut I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College
p56
aVto find, among the auditors in my classroom,
p57
aVa 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women
p58
aVwho seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.
p59
aa(lp60
VHis name was Sandor Teszler.
p61
aVHe was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead
p62
aVand whose grandchildren lived far away.
p63
aVIn appearance, he resembled Mahatma Gandhi,
p64
aVminus the loincloth, plus orthopedic boots.
p65
aVHe had been born in 1903 in the provinces
p66
aVof the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,
p67
aVin what later would become Yugoslavia.
p68
aVHe was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew \u2014
p69
aVhis parents weren't very religious anyhow \u2014
p70
aVbut because he had been born with two club feet,
p71
aVa condition which, in those days, required institutionalization
p72
aVand a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11.
p73
aVHe went to the commercial business high school as a young man
p74
aVin Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest
p75
aVand he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation
p76
aVwhen he went into textile engineering, the success continued.
p77
aVHe built one plant after another.
p78
aVHe married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who
p79
aVassured him that he was of great value to the economy.
p80
aa(lp81
VOnce, as he had left instructions to have done,
p82
aVhe was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants.
p83
aVThe night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks \u2014
p84
aVit was a hosiery mill, and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock
p85
aVand was shoveling in mountains of socks.
p86
aVMr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said,
p87
aV"But why do you steal from me? If you need money you have only to ask."
p88
aVThe night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant,
p89
aVsaid, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"
p90
aVBut Mr. Teszler answered, "No, that will not be necessary.
p91
aVHe will not steal from us again."
p92
aa(lp93
VWell, maybe he was too trusting, because he stayed where he was
p94
aVlong after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria
p95
aVand even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest.
p96
aVHe took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets
p97
aVthat could be worn about the necks of himself and his family.
p98
aVAnd then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested
p99
aVand they were taken to a death house on the Danube.
p100
aVIn those early days of the Final Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;
p101
aVpeople were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river.
p102
aVBut none who entered that death house had ever come out alive.
p103
aVAnd in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film \u2014
p104
aVthe Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief
p105
aVwho had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.
p106
aVIt was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality,
p107
aVone of Mr. Teszler's sons, Andrew, looked up and said,
p108
aV"Is it time to take the capsule now, Papa?"
p109
aVAnd the Gauleiter, who afterwards vanishes from this story,
p110
aVleaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear,
p111
aV"No, do not take the capsule. Help is on the way."
p112
aVAnd then resumed the beating.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut help was on the way, and shortly afterwards
p115
aVa car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.
p116
aVThey were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens
p117
aVand they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers
p118
aVfor the duration of the War, surviving burnings and bombings
p119
aVand, at the end of the War, arrest by the Soviets.
p120
aVProbably, Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts
p121
aVbecause he managed to take his family first to Great Britain,
p122
aVthen to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South.
p123
aVWhich, as chance would have it, was Spartanburg, South Carolina,
p124
aVthe location of Wofford College.
p125
aVAnd there, Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success,
p126
aVespecially after he invented the process
p127
aVfor manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education,
p130
aVwhen the Klan was resurgent all over the South,
p131
aVMr. Teszler said, "I have heard this talk before."
p132
aVAnd he called his top assistant to him and asked,
p133
aV"Where would you say, in this region, racism is most virulent?"
p134
aV"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."
p135
aV"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain
p136
aVand announce we are going to build a major plant there."
p137
aVThe man did as he was told, and shortly afterwards,
p138
aVMr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.
p139
aVNow, you should know that at that time,
p140
aVthe textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated.
p141
aVThe white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said,
p142
aV"Mr. Teszler, I trust you\u2019re going to be hiring a lot of white workers."
p143
aVMr. Teszler told him, "You bring me the best workers that you can find,
p144
aVand if they are good enough, I will hire them."
p145
aVHe also received a visit from the leader of the black community,
p146
aVa minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler, I sure hope you're going to
p147
aVhire some black workers for this new plant of yours."
p148
aVHe got the same answer: "You bring the best workers that you can find,
p149
aVand if they are good enough, I will hire them."
p150
aVAs it happens, the black minister did his job better than the white mayor,
p151
aVbut that's neither here or there.
p152
aVMr. Teszler hired 16 men: eight white, eight black.
p153
aa(lp154
VThey were to be his seed group, his future foremen.
p155
aVHe had installed the heavy equipment for his new process
p156
aVin an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,
p157
aVand for two months these 16 men would live and work together,
p158
aVmastering the new process.
p159
aVHe gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility
p160
aVand he asked if there were any questions.
p161
aVThere was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet,
p162
aVand then one of the white workers stepped forward and said,
p163
aV"Well, yeah. We\u2019ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep,
p164
aVthere's only one place to eat, there's only one bathroom,
p165
aVthere's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what?"
p166
aVMr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region
p167
aVand this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions?"
p168
aV"No, I reckon I don't."
p169
aVAnd two months later when the main plant opened
p170
aVand hundreds of new workers, white and black,
p171
aVpoured in to see the facility for the first time,
p172
aVthey were met by the 16 foremen, white and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.
p173
aVThey toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions, and
p174
aVinevitably the same question arose:
p175
aV"Is this plant integrated or what?"
p176
aVAnd one of the white foremen stepped forward and said,
p177
aV"You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers
p178
aVin this industry in this region and this is how we do business.
p179
aVDo you have any other questions?"
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd there were none. In one fell swoop,
p182
aVMr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South.
p183
aVIt was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,
p184
aVconducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint.
p185
aVIn his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having retired from the textile industry,
p186
aVadopted Wofford College,
p187
aVauditing courses every semester,
p188
aVand because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved,
p189
aVbecoming affectionately known as "Opi" \u2014 which is Magyar for grandfather \u2014
p190
aVby all and sundry. Before I got there, the library of the college
p191
aVhad been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993,
p192
aVthe faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College \u2014
p193
aVpartly because at that point he had already taken
p194
aVall of the courses in the catalog, but mainly because
p195
aVhe was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us.
p196
aVTo me, it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit
p197
aVof this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina
p198
aVwas a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe.
p199
aVWise he was, indeed, but he also had a wonderful sense of humor.
p200
aVAnd once for an interdisciplinary class,
p201
aVI was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."
p202
aVAs the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase
p203
aVof the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden,
p204
aVonly to find the specter of death waiting for him,
p205
aVMr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And
p206
aVas death opened his cloak to embrace the knight
p207
aVin a ghastly embrace, I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:
p208
aV"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't look so good." (Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VBut it was music that was his greatest passion, especially opera.
p211
aVAnd on the first occasion that I visited his house, he gave me
p212
aVhonor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to.
p213
aVAnd I delighted him by rejecting "Cavalleria Rusticana"
p214
aVin favor of Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."
p215
aVI love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,
p216
aVand he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued.
p217
aVAnd it was at his house that I heard for the first time
p218
aVBartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from
p219
aVMr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina
p220
aVin the last year of the composer's life.
p221
aVHe was dying of leukemia and he knew it,
p222
aVand he dedicated this concerto to his wife,
p223
aVDita, who was herself a concert pianist.
p224
aVAnd into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso,"
p225
aVhe incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard
p226
aVoutside his window in what he knew would be his last spring;
p227
aVhe was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
p228
aVAnd clearly this composition is his final statement to her \u2014
p229
aVit was first performed after his death \u2014
p230
aVand through her to the world.
p231
aVAnd just as clearly, it is saying, "It's okay. It was all so beautiful.
p232
aVWhenever you hear this, I will be there."
p233
aa(lp234
VIt was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned
p235
aVthat the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York
p236
aVwas paid for by Sandor Teszler. "Jó napot, Bela!"
p237
aVNot long before Mr. Teszler\u2019s own death at the age of 97,
p238
aVhe heard me hold forth on human iniquity.
p239
aVI delivered a lecture in which I described history
p240
aVas, on the whole, a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality,
p241
aVand Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said,
p242
aV"You know, Doctor, human beings are fundamentally good."
p243
aVAnd I made a vow to myself, then and there,
p244
aVthat if this man who had such cause to think otherwise
p245
aVhad reached that conclusion,
p246
aVI would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow.
p247
aVAnd now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.
p248
aV"Jó napot, Sandor!"
p249
aa(lp250
VI thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end,
p251
aVbut almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor \u2014
p252
aVactually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina, then in his late seventies \u2014
p253
aVwho had been a pioneer in open-heart surgery,
p254
aVand, tinkering away in his garage behind his house,
p255
aVhad invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures.
p256
aVHe's also a prodigious art collector, beginning as an intern in Budapest
p257
aVby collecting 16th- and 17th-century Dutch art and Hungarian painting,
p258
aVand when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art,
p259
aVRussian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.
p260
aVHe's the author of seven books, six of them on Mayan ceramics.
p261
aVIt was he who broke the Mayan codex, enabling scholars to relate
p262
aVthe pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.
p263
aa(lp264
VOn the occasion of my first visit, we toured his house
p265
aVand we saw hundreds of works of museum quality,
p266
aVand then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said,
p267
aVwith obvious pride, "Now for the piece De resistance."
p268
aVAnd he opened the door and we walked into a
p269
aVwindowless 20-by-20-foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling, and
p270
aVcrammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics.
p271
aVNow, I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics,
p272
aVbut I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said,
p273
aV"But Dr. Robicsek, this is absolutely dazzling."
p274
aV"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
p275
aVThey would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece,
p276
aVbut it was not a good one." (Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VWell, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek
p279
aVto lecture at Wofford College on \u2014 what else?
p280
aV\u2014 Leonardo da Vinci. And further, I should invite him to meet
p281
aVmy oldest trustee, who had majored in French history at Yale
p282
aVsome 70-odd years before and, at 89, still ruled the world's
p283
aVlargest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand.
p284
aVHis name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed,
p285
aVand Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited
p286
aVand delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success.
p287
aVAnd afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek
p288
aVon one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.
p289
aVAnd it was only at that moment, as we were sitting down to dinner,
p290
aVthat I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created,
p291
aVbecause to bring these two titans, these two masters of the universe
p292
aVtogether \u2014 it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.
p293
aVIf they didn't like each other, we could all get trampled to death.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut they did, they did like each other.
p296
aVThey got along famously until the very end of the meal,
p297
aVand then they got into a furious argument.
p298
aVAnd what they were arguing about was this:
p299
aVwhether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first. (Laughter)
p300
aVMr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
p301
aVI was still trying to take in the notion that these titans,
p302
aVthese masters of the universe, in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies,
p303
aVwhen Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying,
p304
aV"You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book."
p305
aVAnd Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair, but quickly gathered his wits,
p306
aVleaned forward and said, "Well, that is true, but I'll bet you went
p307
aVto the movie with a grandchild." "Well, yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.
p308
aV"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I realized, in this moment of revelation,
p311
aVthat what these two men were revealing was the secret
p312
aVof their extraordinary success, each in his own right.
p313
aVAnd it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity,
p314
aVthat irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject,
p315
aVno matter what the cost,
p316
aVeven at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock
p317
aVare willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around
p318
aVto imagine anything in the year 2100, a scant 93 years from now.
p319
aV"Live each day as if it is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.
p320
aV"Learn as if you'll live forever."
p321
aVThis is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this.
p322
aVIt is this inextinguishable, undaunted appetite for learning and experience,
p323
aVno matter how risible, no matter how esoteric,
p324
aVno matter how seditious it might seem.
p325
aVThis defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians \u2014
p326
aVRobicsek, Teszler and Bartok \u2014 as it does my own.
p327
aVAs it does, I suspect, that of everybody here.
p328
aa(lp329
VTo which I need only add, "Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves."
p330
aVThis is our task; we know it will be hard.
p331
aV"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves. Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)
