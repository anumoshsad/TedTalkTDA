VI used to think
p4
aVthe whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.
p5
aVEveryone said the path to happiness was success,
p6
aVso I searched for that ideal job,
p7
aVthat perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment.
p8
aVBut instead of ever feeling fulfilled,
p9
aVI felt anxious and adrift.
p10
aVAnd I wasn't alone; my friends \u2014 they struggled with this, too.
p11
aa(lp12
VEventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology
p13
aVto learn what truly makes people happy.
p14
aVBut what I discovered there changed my life.
p15
aVThe data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.
p16
aVAnd what really struck me was this:
p17
aVthe suicide rate has been rising around the world,
p18
aVand it recently reached a 30-year high in America.
p19
aVEven though life is getting objectively better
p20
aVby nearly every conceivable standard,
p21
aVmore people feel hopeless,
p22
aVdepressed and alone.
p23
aVThere's an emptiness gnawing away at people,
p24
aVand you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.
p25
aVSooner or later, I think we all wonder:
p26
aVIs this all there is?
p27
aVAnd according to the research, what predicts this despair
p28
aVis not a lack of happiness.
p29
aVIt's a lack of something else,
p30
aVa lack of having meaning in life.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut that raised some questions for me.
p33
aVIs there more to life than being happy?
p34
aVAnd what's the difference between being happy
p35
aVand having meaning in life?
p36
aVMany psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease,
p37
aVfeeling good in the moment.
p38
aVMeaning, though, is deeper.
p39
aVThe renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says
p40
aVmeaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself
p41
aVand from developing the best within you.
p42
aVOur culture is obsessed with happiness,
p43
aVbut I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.
p44
aVAnd the studies show that people who have meaning in life,
p45
aVthey're more resilient,
p46
aVthey do better in school and at work,
p47
aVand they even live longer.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo this all made me wonder:
p50
aVHow can we each live more meaningfully?
p51
aVTo find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people
p52
aVand reading through thousands of pages of psychology,
p53
aVneuroscience and philosophy.
p54
aVBringing it all together,
p55
aVI found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.
p56
aVAnd we can each create lives of meaning
p57
aVby building some or all of these pillars in our lives.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe first pillar is belonging.
p60
aVBelonging comes from being in relationships
p61
aVwhere you're valued for who you are intrinsically
p62
aVand where you value others as well.
p63
aVBut some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging;
p64
aVyou're valued for what you believe,
p65
aVfor who you hate,
p66
aVnot for who you are.
p67
aVTrue belonging springs from love.
p68
aVIt lives in moments among individuals,
p69
aVand it's a choice \u2014 you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.
p70
aa(lp71
VHere's an example.
p72
aVEach morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper
p73
aVfrom the same street vendor in New York.
p74
aVThey don't just conduct a transaction, though.
p75
aVThey take a moment to slow down, talk,
p76
aVand treat each other like humans.
p77
aVBut one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change,
p78
aVand the vendor said,
p79
aV"Don't worry about it."
p80
aVBut Jonathan insisted on paying,
p81
aVso he went to the store and bought something he didn't need
p82
aVto make change.
p83
aVBut when he gave the money to the vendor,
p84
aVthe vendor drew back.
p85
aVHe was hurt.
p86
aVHe was trying to do something kind,
p87
aVbut Jonathan had rejected him.
p88
aa(lp89
VI think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it.
p90
aVI do.
p91
aVI'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.
p92
aVI'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.
p93
aVThese acts devalue others.
p94
aVThey make them feel invisible and unworthy.
p95
aVBut when you lead with love, you create a bond
p96
aVthat lifts each of you up.
p97
aa(lp98
VFor many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning,
p99
aVthose bonds to family and friends.
p100
aVFor others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose.
p101
aVNow, finding your purpose is not the same thing
p102
aVas finding that job that makes you happy.
p103
aVPurpose is less about what you want than about what you give.
p104
aVA hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.
p105
aVMany parents tell me,
p106
aV"My purpose is raising my children."
p107
aVThe key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.
p108
aVOf course, for many of us, that happens through work.
p109
aVThat's how we contribute and feel needed.
p110
aVBut that also means that issues like disengagement at work,
p111
aVunemployment,
p112
aVlow labor force participation \u2014
p113
aVthese aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.
p114
aVWithout something worthwhile to do,
p115
aVpeople flounder.
p116
aVOf course, you don't have to find purpose at work,
p117
aVbut purpose gives you something to live for,
p118
aVsome "why" that drives you forward.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself,
p121
aVbut in a completely different way:
p122
aVtranscendence.
p123
aVTranscendent states are those rare moments
p124
aVwhen you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life,
p125
aVyour sense of self fades away,
p126
aVand you feel connected to a higher reality.
p127
aVFor one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art.
p128
aVFor another person, it was at church.
p129
aVFor me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.
p130
aVSometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.
p131
aVThese transcendent experiences can change you.
p132
aVOne study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees
p133
aVfor one minute.
p134
aVBut afterwards they felt less self-centered,
p135
aVand they even behaved more generously
p136
aVwhen given the chance to help someone.
p137
aa(lp138
VBelonging, purpose, transcendence.
p139
aVNow, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found,
p140
aVtends to surprise people.
p141
aVThe fourth pillar is storytelling,
p142
aVthe story you tell yourself about yourself.
p143
aVCreating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.
p144
aVIt helps you understand how you became you.
p145
aVBut we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories
p146
aVand can change the way we're telling them.
p147
aVYour life isn't just a list of events.
p148
aVYou can edit, interpret and retell your story,
p149
aVeven as you're constrained by the facts.
p150
aa(lp151
VI met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.
p152
aVAfter his injury, Emeka told himself,
p153
aV"My life was great playing football,
p154
aVbut now look at me."
p155
aVPeople who tell stories like this \u2014
p156
aV"My life was good. Now it's bad." \u2014
p157
aVtend to be more anxious and depressed.
p158
aVAnd that was Emeka for a while.
p159
aVBut with time, he started to weave a different story.
p160
aVHis new story was,
p161
aV"Before my injury, my life was purposeless.
p162
aVI partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy.
p163
aVBut my injury made me realize I could be a better man."
p164
aVThat edit to his story changed Emeka's life.
p165
aVAfter telling the new story to himself,
p166
aVEmeka started mentoring kids,
p167
aVand he discovered what his purpose was:
p168
aVserving others.
p169
aVThe psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story,"
p170
aVwhere the bad is redeemed by the good.
p171
aVPeople leading meaningful lives, he's found,
p172
aVtend to tell stories about their lives
p173
aVdefined by redemption, growth and love.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut what makes people change their stories?
p176
aVSome people get help from a therapist,
p177
aVbut you can do it on your own, too,
p178
aVjust by reflecting on your life thoughtfully,
p179
aVhow your defining experiences shaped you,
p180
aVwhat you lost, what you gained.
p181
aVThat's what Emeka did.
p182
aVYou won't change your story overnight;
p183
aVit could take years and be painful.
p184
aVAfter all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.
p185
aVBut embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom,
p186
aVto finding that good that sustains you.
p187
aa(lp188
VBelonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling:
p189
aVthose are the four pillars of meaning.
p190
aVWhen I was younger,
p191
aVI was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars.
p192
aVMy parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.
p193
aVSufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes
p194
aVand the poet Rumi.
p195
aVTwice a week, Sufis would come to our home
p196
aVto meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories.
p197
aVTheir practice also involved serving all of creation
p198
aVthrough small acts of love,
p199
aVwhich meant being kind even when people wronged you.
p200
aVBut it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.
p201
aa(lp202
VEventually, I left home for college
p203
aVand without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life,
p204
aVI felt unmoored.
p205
aVAnd I started searching for those things that make life worth living.
p206
aVThat's what set me on this journey.
p207
aVLooking back, I now realize
p208
aVthat the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning.
p209
aVThe pillars were part of the architecture,
p210
aVand the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply.
p211
aa(lp212
VOf course, the same principle applies
p213
aVin other strong communities as well \u2014
p214
aVgood ones and bad ones.
p215
aVGangs, cults:
p216
aVthese are cultures of meaning that use the pillars
p217
aVand give people something to live and die for.
p218
aVBut that's exactly why we as a society
p219
aVmust offer better alternatives.
p220
aVWe need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions
p221
aVto help people become their best selves.
p222
aVBut living a meaningful life takes work.
p223
aVIt's an ongoing process.
p224
aVAs each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives,
p225
aVadding to our story.
p226
aVAnd sometimes we can get off track.
p227
aa(lp228
VWhenever that happens to me,
p229
aVI remember a powerful experience I had with my father.
p230
aVSeveral months after I graduated from college,
p231
aVmy dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him.
p232
aVHe survived, and when I asked him what was going through his mind
p233
aVas he faced death,
p234
aVhe said all he could think about was needing to live
p235
aVso he could be there for my brother and me,
p236
aVand this gave him the will to fight for life.
p237
aVWhen he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery,
p238
aVinstead of counting backwards from 10,
p239
aVhe repeated our names like a mantra.
p240
aVHe wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth
p241
aVif he died.
p242
aa(lp243
VMy dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.
p244
aVIt's a humble life,
p245
aVbut a good life.
p246
aVLying there facing death, he had a reason to live:
p247
aVlove.
p248
aVHis sense of belonging within his family,
p249
aVhis purpose as a dad,
p250
aVhis transcendent meditation, repeating our names \u2014
p251
aVthese, he says, are the reasons why he survived.
p252
aVThat's the story he tells himself.
p253
aa(lp254
VThat's the power of meaning.
p255
aVHappiness comes and goes.
p256
aVBut when life is really good
p257
aVand when things are really bad,
p258
aVhaving meaning gives you something to hold on to.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
