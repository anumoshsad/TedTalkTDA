VI'm here today to talk about social change,
p4
aVnot a new therapy or a new intervention
p5
aVor a new way of working with kids or something like that,
p6
aVbut a new business model for social change,
p7
aVa new way of tackling the problem.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn Britain, 63 percent of all men
p10
aVwho come out of short sentences from prison
p11
aVre-offend again within a year.
p12
aVNow how many previous offenses
p13
aVdo you think they have on average
p14
aVmanaged to commit?
p15
aVForty-three.
p16
aVAnd how many previous times do you think they've been in prison?
p17
aVSeven.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,
p20
aVand we said to the Ministry of Justice,
p21
aVwhat's it worth to you
p22
aVif fewer of these guys re-offend?
p23
aVIt's got to be worth something, right?
p24
aVI mean, there's prison costs,
p25
aVthere's police costs, there's court costs,
p26
aVall these things that you're spending money on
p27
aVto deal with these guys. What's it worth?
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, of course, we care about the social value.
p30
aVSocial Finance, the organization I helped set up,
p31
aVcares about social stuff.
p32
aVBut we wanted to make the economic case,
p33
aVbecause if we could make the economic case,
p34
aVthen the value of doing this  would be completely compelling.
p35
aVAnd if we can agree on both a value
p36
aVand a way of measuring whether we've been
p37
aVsuccessful at reducing that re-offending,
p38
aVthen we can do something
p39
aVwe think rather interesting.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe idea is called the social impact bond.
p42
aVNow, the social impact bond is simply saying,
p43
aVif we can get the government to agree,
p44
aVthat we can create a contract where
p45
aVthey only pay if it worked.
p46
aVSo that means that they can try out new stuff
p47
aVwithout the embarrassment
p48
aVof having to pay if it didn't work,
p49
aVwhich for still quite a lot of bits of government,
p50
aVthat's a serious issue.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, many of you may have noticed
p53
aVthere's a problem at this point,
p54
aVand that is that it takes a long time to measure
p55
aVwhether those outcomes have happened.
p56
aVSo we have to raise some money.
p57
aVWe use the contract to raise money
p58
aVfrom socially motivated investors.
p59
aVSocially motivated investors:
p60
aVthere's an interesting idea, right?
p61
aVBut actually, there's a lot of people who,
p62
aVif they're given the chance,
p63
aVwould love to invest in something
p64
aVthat does social good.
p65
aVAnd here's the opportunity.
p66
aVDo you want to also help government find
p67
aVwhether there's a better economic model,
p68
aVnot just leaving these guys to come out of prison
p69
aVand waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again,
p70
aVbut actually working with them
p71
aVto move to a different path
p72
aVto end up with fewer crimes
p73
aVand fewer victims?
p74
aa(lp75
VSo we find some investors,
p76
aVand they pay for a set of services,
p77
aVand if those services are successful,
p78
aVthen they improve outcomes,
p79
aVand with those measured reductions in re-offending,
p80
aVgovernment saves money,
p81
aVand with those savings,
p82
aVthey can pay outcomes.
p83
aVAnd the investors do not just get their money back,
p84
aVbut they make a return.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo in March 2010, we signed
p87
aVthe first social impact bond
p88
aVwith the Ministry of Justice
p89
aVaround Peterborough Prison.
p90
aVIt was to work with 3,000 offenders
p91
aVsplit into three cohorts of 1,000 each.
p92
aVNow, each of those cohorts
p93
aVwould get measured over the two years
p94
aVthat they were coming out of prison.
p95
aVThey've got to have a year to commit their crimes,
p96
aVsix months to get through the court system,
p97
aVand then they would be compared to a group
p98
aVtaken from the police national computer,
p99
aVas similar as possible,
p100
aVand we would get paid
p101
aVproviding we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction,
p102
aVfor every conviction event that didn't happen.
p103
aVSo we get paid for crimes saved.
p104
aVNow if we achieved that 10-percent reduction
p105
aVacross all three cohorts,
p106
aVthen the investors get a seven and a half percent
p107
aVannualized return on their investment,
p108
aVand if we do better than that,
p109
aVthey can get up to 13 percent
p110
aVannualized return on their investment,
p111
aVwhich is okay.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo everyone wins here, right?
p114
aVThe Ministry of Justice can try out a new program
p115
aVand they only pay if it works.
p116
aVInvestors get two opportunities:
p117
aVfor the first time, they can invest in social change.
p118
aVAlso, they make a reasonable return,
p119
aVand they also know that
p120
aVfirst investors in these kinds of things,
p121
aVthey're going to have to believers.
p122
aVThey're going to have to care in the social program,
p123
aVbut if this builds a track record
p124
aVover five or 10 years,
p125
aVthen you can widen that investor community
p126
aVas more people have confidence in the product.
p127
aVThe service providers, well, for the first time,
p128
aVthey've got an opportunity to provide services
p129
aVand grow the evidence for what they're doing
p130
aVin a really constructive way and learn
p131
aVand demonstrate the value of what they're doing
p132
aVover five or six years, not just one or two
p133
aVas often happens at the moment.
p134
aVSociety wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.
p135
aVNow, the offenders, they also benefit.
p136
aVInstead of just coming out of the prison
p137
aVwith 46 pounds in their pocket,
p138
aVhalf of them not knowing where they're spending
p139
aVtheir first night out of jail,
p140
aVactually, someone meets them in prison,
p141
aVlearns about their issues,
p142
aVmeets them at the gate,
p143
aVtakes them through to somewhere to stay,
p144
aVconnects them to benefits, connects them to employment,
p145
aVdrug rehabilitation, mental health,
p146
aVwhatever's needed.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo let's think of another example:
p149
aVworking with children in care.
p150
aVSocial impact bonds work great
p151
aVfor any area where there is at the moment
p152
aVvery expensive provision that produces
p153
aVpoor outcomes for people.
p154
aVSo children in the state care
p155
aVtend to do very badly.
p156
aVOnly 13 percent achieve a reasonable level
p157
aVof five GCSEs at 16,
p158
aVagainst 58 percent of the wider population.
p159
aVMore troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison
p160
aVhave spent some time in care.
p161
aVAnd even more worryingly,
p162
aVand this is a Home Office statistic,
p163
aV70 percent of prostitutes
p164
aVhave spent some time in care.
p165
aVThe state is not a great parent.
p166
aVBut there are great programs
p167
aVfor adolescents who are on the edge of care,
p168
aVand 30 percent of kids going into care
p169
aVare adolescents.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo we set up a program with Essex County Council
p172
aVto test out intensive family therapeutic support
p173
aVfor those families with adolescents
p174
aVon the edge of the care system.
p175
aVEssex only pays in the event
p176
aVthat it's saving them care costs.
p177
aVInvestors have put in 3.1 million pounds.
p178
aVThat program started last month.
p179
aVOthers, around homelessness in London,
p180
aVaround youth and employment and education
p181
aVelsewhere in the country.
p182
aVThere are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,
p183
aVand amazing levels of interest in this idea
p184
aVall over the world.
p185
aVSo David Cameron's put 20 million pounds
p186
aVinto a social outcomes fund to support this idea.
p187
aVObama has suggested 300 million dollars
p188
aVin the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas
p189
aVand structures to move it forward,
p190
aVand a lot of other countries
p191
aVare demonstrating considerable interest.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what's caused this excitement?
p194
aVWhy is this so different for people?
p195
aVWell, the first piece, which we've talked about,
p196
aVis innovation.
p197
aVIt enables testing of new ideas
p198
aVin a way that's less difficult for everybody.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe second piece it brings is rigor.
p201
aVBy working to outcomes, people really have to test
p202
aVand bring data into the situation that one's dealing with.
p203
aVSo taking Peterborough as an example,
p204
aVwe add case management
p205
aVacross all of the different organizations that we're working with
p206
aVso they know
p207
aVwhat actually has been done with different prisoners,
p208
aVand at the same time they learn
p209
aVfrom the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,
p210
aVbecause we pushed for the data,
p211
aVwhat actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not.
p212
aVAnd we learn and adapt the program accordingly.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd this leads to the third element, which is new,
p215
aVand that's flexibility.
p216
aVBecause normal contracting for things,
p217
aVwhen you're spending government money,
p218
aVyou're spending our money, tax money,
p219
aVand the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it
p220
aVso the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it.
p221
aVNow any entrepreneur in the room knows
p222
aVthat version 1.0, the business plan,
p223
aVis not the one that generally works.
p224
aVSo when you're trying to do something like this,
p225
aVyou need the flexibility to adapt the program.
p226
aVAnd again, in Peterborough, we started off
p227
aVwith a program, but we also collected data,
p228
aVand over the period of time,
p229
aVwe nuanced and changed that program
p230
aVto add a range of other elements,
p231
aVso that the service adapts
p232
aVand we meet the needs of the long term
p233
aVas well as the short term:
p234
aVgreater engagement from the prisoners,
p235
aVlonger-term engagement as well.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe last element is partnership.
p238
aVThere is, at the moment, a stale  debate going on very often:
p239
aVstate's better, public sector's better,
p240
aVprivate sector's better, social sector's better,
p241
aVfor a lot of these programs.
p242
aVActually, for creating social change,
p243
aVwe need to bring in the expertise
p244
aVfrom all of those parties
p245
aVin order to make this work.
p246
aVAnd this creates a structure
p247
aVthrough which they can combine.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo where does this leave us?
p250
aVThis leaves us with a way
p251
aVthat people can invest in social change.
p252
aVWe've met thousands, possibly millions of people,
p253
aVwho want the opportunity to invest in social change.
p254
aVWe've met champions all over the public sector
p255
aVkeen to make these kinds of differences.
p256
aVWith this kind of model,
p257
aVwe can help bring them together.
p258
aa(lp259
VThank you.
