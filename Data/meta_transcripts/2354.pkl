(lp2
(lp3
VA few years ago,
p4
aVwith my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,
p5
aVI invented a new technology for editing genomes.
p6
aVIt's called CRISPR-Cas9.
p7
aVThe CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes
p8
aVto the DNA in cells
p9
aVthat could allow us to cure genetic disease.
p10
aa(lp11
VYou might be interested to know
p12
aVthat the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project
p13
aVthat was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections.
p14
aVBacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment,
p15
aVand we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb \u2014
p16
aVa bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb
p17
aVbefore it gets destroyed.
p18
aVSo, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,
p19
aVthat allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it.
p20
aa(lp21
VPart of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas9,
p22
aVthat's able to seek out, cut and eventually degrade viral DNA
p23
aVin a specific way.
p24
aVAnd it was through our research
p25
aVto understand the activity of this protein, Cas9,
p26
aVthat we realized that we could harness its function
p27
aVas a genetic engineering technology \u2014
p28
aVa way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells
p29
aVwith incredible precision \u2014
p30
aVthat would offer opportunities
p31
aVto do things that really haven't been possible in the past.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe CRISPR technology has already been used
p34
aVto change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys,
p35
aVother organisms as well.
p36
aVChinese scientists showed recently
p37
aVthat they could even use the CRISPR technology
p38
aVto change genes in human embryos.
p39
aVAnd scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR
p40
aVto remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus
p41
aVfrom infected human cells.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe opportunity to do this kind of genome editing
p44
aValso raises various ethical issues that we have to consider,
p45
aVbecause this technology can be employed not only in adult cells,
p46
aVbut also in the embryos of organisms,
p47
aVincluding our own species.
p48
aVAnd so, together with my colleagues,
p49
aVI've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented,
p50
aVso that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications
p51
aVof a technology like this.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhat I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is,
p54
aVwhat it can do,
p55
aVwhere we are today
p56
aVand why I think we need to take a prudent path forward
p57
aVin the way that we employ this technology.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhen viruses infect a cell, they inject their DNA.
p60
aVAnd in a bacterium,
p61
aVthe CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus,
p62
aVand inserted in little bits into the chromosome \u2014
p63
aVthe DNA of the bacterium.
p64
aVAnd these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR.
p65
aVCRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VA big mouthful \u2014 you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR.
p69
aVIt's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time,
p70
aVthe viruses they have been exposed to.
p71
aVAnd importantly, those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny,
p72
aVso cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation,
p73
aVbut over many generations of cells.
p74
aVThis allows the cells to keep a record of infection,
p75
aVand as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,
p76
aVthe CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells.
p77
aVOnce those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome,
p78
aVthe cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA,
p79
aVwhich is orange in this picture,
p80
aVthat is an exact replicate of the viral DNA.
p81
aVRNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,
p82
aVand it allows interaction with DNA molecules
p83
aVthat have a matching sequence.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus
p86
aVassociate \u2014 they bind \u2014 to protein called Cas9,
p87
aVwhich is white in the picture,
p88
aVand form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell.
p89
aVIt searches through all of the DNA in the cell,
p90
aVto find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs.
p91
aVAnd when those sites are found \u2014
p92
aVas you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA \u2014
p93
aVthis complex associates with that DNA
p94
aVand allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.
p95
aVIt makes a very precise break.
p96
aVSo we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex
p97
aVlike a pair of scissors that can cut DNA \u2014
p98
aVit makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix.
p99
aVAnd importantly, this complex is programmable,
p100
aVso it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences,
p101
aVand make a break in the DNA at that site.
p102
aa(lp103
VAs I'm going to tell you now,
p104
aVwe recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering,
p105
aVto allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA
p106
aVat the site where this break was introduced.
p107
aVThat's sort of analogous
p108
aVto the way that we use a word-processing program
p109
aVto fix a typo in a document.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering
p112
aVis because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA
p113
aVand repair it.
p114
aVSo when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA,
p115
aVit can fix that break,
p116
aVeither by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA
p117
aVwith a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position,
p118
aVor it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.
p119
aVSo if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA
p120
aVat precise places,
p121
aVwe can trigger cells to repair those breaks,
p122
aVby either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information.
p123
aVSo if we were able to program the CRISPR technology
p124
aVto make a break in DNA
p125
aVat the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example,
p126
aVwe could trigger cells to repair that mutation.
p127
aa(lp128
VGenome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s.
p129
aVWe've had technologies for sequencing DNA,
p130
aVfor copying DNA,
p131
aVand even for manipulating DNA.
p132
aVAnd these technologies were very promising,
p133
aVbut the problem was that they were either inefficient,
p134
aVor they were difficult enough to use
p135
aVthat most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories,
p136
aVor certainly for many clinical applications.
p137
aVSo, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,
p138
aVbecause of its relative simplicity.
p139
aVWe can think of older genome engineering technologies
p140
aVas similar to having to rewire your computer
p141
aVeach time you want to run a new piece of software,
p142
aVwhereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome,
p143
aVwe can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo once a double-stranded break is made in DNA,
p146
aVwe can induce repair,
p147
aVand thereby potentially achieve astounding things,
p148
aVlike being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia
p149
aVor cause Huntington's Disease.
p150
aVI actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology
p151
aVare going to happen in the blood,
p152
aVwhere it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells,
p153
aVcompared to solid tissues.
p154
aa(lp155
VRight now, a lot of the work that's going on
p156
aVapplies to animal models of human disease, such as mice.
p157
aVThe technology is being used to make very precise changes
p158
aVthat allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA
p159
aVaffect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow in this example,
p162
aVthe CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene
p163
aVby making a tiny change in the DNA
p164
aVin a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice.
p165
aVImagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates
p166
aVby just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome,
p167
aVand they're otherwise completely normal.
p168
aVAnd when we sequence the DNA from these animals,
p169
aVwe find that the change in the DNA
p170
aVhas occurred at exactly the place where we induced it,
p171
aVusing the CRISPR technology.
p172
aa(lp173
VAdditional experiments are going on in other animals
p174
aVthat are useful for creating models for human disease,
p175
aVsuch as monkeys.
p176
aVAnd here we find that we can use these systems
p177
aVto test the application of this technology in particular tissues,
p178
aVfor example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells.
p179
aVWe also want to understand better
p180
aVhow to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut,
p181
aVand also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target,
p182
aVor unintended effects of using the technology.
p183
aa(lp184
VI think that we will see clinical application of this technology,
p185
aVcertainly in adults,
p186
aVwithin the next 10 years.
p187
aVI think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials
p188
aVand possibly even approved therapies within that time,
p189
aVwhich is a very exciting thing to think about.
p190
aVAnd because of the excitement around this technology,
p191
aVthere's a lot of interest in start-up companies
p192
aVthat have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology,
p193
aVand lots of venture capitalists
p194
aVthat have been investing in these companies.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut we have to also consider
p197
aVthat the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement.
p198
aVImagine that we could try to engineer humans
p199
aVthat have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones,
p200
aVor less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease
p201
aVor even to have properties
p202
aVthat we would consider maybe to be desirable,
p203
aVlike a different eye color or to be taller, things like that.
p204
aV"Designer humans," if you will.
p205
aVRight now, the genetic information
p206
aVto understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits
p207
aVis mostly not known.
p208
aVBut it's important to know
p209
aVthat the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes,
p210
aVonce that knowledge becomes available.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider,
p213
aVand this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause
p214
aVin any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,
p215
aVto give us time
p216
aVto really consider all of the various implications of doing so.
p217
aVAnd actually, there is an important precedent for such a pause
p218
aVfrom the 1970s,
p219
aVwhen scientists got together
p220
aVto call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning,
p221
aVuntil the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, genome-engineered humans are not with us yet,
p224
aVbut this is no longer science fiction.
p225
aVGenome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now.
p226
aVAnd this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility,
p227
aVto consider carefully both the unintended consequences
p228
aVas well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough.
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause ends)
p235
aa(lp236
VBruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is a technology with huge consequences,
p237
aVas you pointed out.
p238
aVYour attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine
p239
aVis incredibly responsible.
p240
aVThere are, of course, the therapeutic results of this,
p241
aVbut then there are the un-therapeutic ones
p242
aVand they seem to be the ones gaining traction,
p243
aVparticularly in the media.
p244
aVThis is one of the latest issues of The Economist \u2014 "Editing humanity."
p245
aVIt's all about genetic enhancement, it's not about therapeutics.
p246
aVWhat kind of reactions did you get back in March
p247
aVfrom your colleagues in the science world,
p248
aVwhen you asked or suggested
p249
aVthat we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it?
p250
aa(lp251
VJennifer Doudna: My colleagues were actually, I think, delighted
p252
aVto have the opportunity to discuss this openly.
p253
aVIt's interesting that as I talk to people,
p254
aVmy scientific colleagues as well as others,
p255
aVthere's a wide variety of viewpoints about this.
p256
aVSo clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion.
p257
aa(lp258
VBG: There's a big meeting happening in December
p259
aVthat you and your colleagues are calling,
p260
aVtogether with the National Academy of Sciences and others,
p261
aVwhat do you hope will come out of the meeting, practically?
p262
aa(lp263
VJD: Well, I hope that we can air the views
p264
aVof many different individuals and stakeholders
p265
aVwho want to think about how to use this technology responsibly.
p266
aVIt may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view,
p267
aVbut I think we should at least understand
p268
aVwhat all the issues are as we go forward.
p269
aa(lp270
VBG: Now, colleagues of yours,
p271
aVlike George Church, for example, at Harvard,
p272
aVthey say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety.
p273
aVWe test and test and test again, in animals and in labs,
p274
aVand then once we feel it's safe enough, we move on to humans."
p275
aVSo that's kind of the other school of thought,
p276
aVthat we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it.
p277
aVIs there a possible split happening in the science community about this?
p278
aVI mean, are we going to see some people holding back
p279
aVbecause they have ethical concerns,
p280
aVand some others just going forward
p281
aVbecause some countries under-regulate or don't regulate at all?
p282
aa(lp283
VJD: Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this,
p284
aVthere are going to be a variety of viewpoints,
p285
aVand I think that's perfectly understandable.
p286
aVI think that in the end,
p287
aVthis technology will be used for human genome engineering,
p288
aVbut I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion
p289
aVof the risks and potential complications
p290
aVwould not be responsible.
p291
aa(lp292
VBG: There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science
p293
aVthat are developing exponentially, pretty much like yours.
p294
aVI'm thinking about artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.
p295
aVNo one seems \u2014
p296
aVaside from autonomous warfare robots \u2014
p297
aVnobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields,
p298
aVin calling for a moratorium.
p299
aVDo you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields?
p300
aa(lp301
VJD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory.
p302
aVSpeaking for myself,
p303
aVit's a little bit uncomfortable to do that.
p304
aVBut I do think that being involved in the genesis of this
p305
aVreally puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility.
p306
aVAnd I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies
p307
aVwill be considered in the same way,
p308
aVjust as we would want to consider something that could have implications
p309
aVin other fields besides biology.
p310
aa(lp311
VBG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.
