VWhat I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects,
p4
aVand that is the neuroscience of sleep.
p5
aa(lp6
VNow, there is a sound \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Alarm clock)
p9
aa(lp10
VAh, it worked!
p11
aVA sound that is desperately familiar to most of us,
p12
aVand of course it's the sound of the alarm clock.
p13
aVAnd what that truly ghastly, awful sound does
p14
aVis stop the single most important behavioral experience
p15
aVthat we have, and that's sleep.
p16
aVIf you're an average sort of person,
p17
aV36 percent of your life will be spent asleep,
p18
aVwhich means that if you live to 90,
p19
aVthen 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important.
p22
aVAnd yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.
p23
aVWe throw it away.
p24
aVWe really just don't think about sleep.
p25
aVAnd so what I'd like to do today is change your views,
p26
aVchange your ideas and your thoughts about sleep.
p27
aVAnd the journey that I want to take you on,
p28
aVwe need to start by going back in time.
p29
aa(lp30
V"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."
p31
aVAny ideas who said that?
p32
aVShakespeare's Julius Caesar.
p33
aVYes, let me give you a few more quotes.
p34
aV"O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse,
p35
aVhow have I frighted thee?"
p36
aVShakespeare again, from \u2014 I won't say it \u2014
p37
aVthe Scottish play.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VFrom the same time:
p42
aV"Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together."
p43
aVExtremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut if we jump forward 400 years,
p46
aVthe tone about sleep changes somewhat.
p47
aVThis is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century:
p48
aV"Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days."
p49
aVBang!
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember
p54
aVthat Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said,
p55
aV"Sleep is for wimps."
p56
aVAnd of course the infamous \u2014 what was his name? \u2014
p57
aVthe infamous Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street" said,
p58
aV"Money never sleeps."
p59
aa(lp60
VWhat do we do in the 20th century about sleep?
p61
aVWell, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb
p62
aVto invade the night, and we occupied the dark,
p63
aVand in the process of this occupation,
p64
aVwe've treated sleep as an illness, almost.
p65
aVWe've treated it as an enemy.
p66
aVAt most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep,
p67
aVand at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep
p68
aVas an illness that needs some sort of a cure.
p69
aVAnd our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound.
p70
aVWhy is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts?
p71
aVWell, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems.
p72
aVYou don't eat. You don't drink.
p73
aVAnd you don't have sex.
p74
aVWell, most of us anyway.
p75
aVAnd so, therefore it's \u2014
p76
aVSorry.
p77
aVIt's a complete waste of time, right?
p78
aVWrong.
p79
aVActually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology,
p80
aVand neuroscientists are beginning to explain
p81
aVwhy it's so very important.
p82
aVSo let's move to the brain.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, here we have a brain.
p85
aVThis is donated by a social scientist,
p86
aVand they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so \u2014
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VSorry.
p91
aVSo I borrowed it.
p92
aVI don't think they noticed. OK.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThe point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep,
p97
aVthis thing doesn't shut down.
p98
aVIn fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active
p99
aVduring the sleep state than during the wake state.
p100
aVThe other thing that's really important about sleep
p101
aVis that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain,
p102
aVbut is to some extent a network property.
p103
aVIf we flip the brain on its back \u2014
p104
aVI love this little bit of spinal cord here \u2014
p105
aVthis bit here is the hypothalamus,
p106
aVand right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures,
p107
aVnot least the biological clock.
p108
aVThe biological clock tells us when it's good to be up,
p109
aVwhen it's good to be asleep,
p110
aVand what that structure does is interact
p111
aVwith a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus,
p112
aVthe lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.
p113
aVAll of those combine,
p114
aVand they send projections down to the brain stem here.
p115
aVThe brain stem then projects forward
p116
aVand bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,
p117
aVwith neurotransmitters that keep us awake
p118
aVand essentially provide us with our consciousness.
p119
aVSo sleep arises from a whole raft
p120
aVof different interactions within the brain,
p121
aVand essentially, sleep is turned on and off
p122
aVas a result of a range of interactions in here.
p123
aa(lp124
VOK. So where have we got to?
p125
aVWe've said that sleep is complicated
p126
aVand it takes 32 years of our life.
p127
aVBut what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.
p128
aVSo why do we sleep?
p129
aVAnd it won't surprise any of you that, of course,
p130
aVas scientists, we don't have a consensus.
p131
aVThere are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep,
p132
aVand I'm going to outline three of those.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe first is sort of the restoration idea,
p135
aVand it's somewhat intuitive.
p136
aVEssentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day,
p137
aVwe restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night.
p138
aVAnd indeed, as an explanation, it goes back to Aristotle,
p139
aVso that's what \u2014 2,300 years ago.
p140
aVIt's gone in and out of fashion.
p141
aVIt's fashionable at the moment
p142
aVbecause what's been shown is that within the brain,
p143
aVa whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep,
p144
aVand those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways.
p145
aVSo there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat about energy conservation?
p148
aVAgain, perhaps intuitive.
p149
aVYou essentially sleep to save calories.
p150
aVNow, when you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out.
p151
aVIf you compare an individual who has slept at night,
p152
aVor stayed awake and hasn't moved very much,
p153
aVthe energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night.
p154
aVNow, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun.
p155
aVNow, I would say that a hot dog bun
p156
aVis kind of a meager return
p157
aVfor such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep.
p158
aVSo I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut the third idea I'm quite attracted to,
p161
aVwhich is brain processing and memory consolidation.
p162
aVWhat we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task,
p163
aVand you sleep-deprive individuals,
p164
aVthe ability to learn that task is smashed.
p165
aVIt's really hugely attenuated.
p166
aVSo sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.
p167
aVHowever, it's not just the laying down of memory
p168
aVand recalling it.
p169
aVWhat's turned out to be really exciting
p170
aVis that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems
p171
aVis hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.
p172
aVIn fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage.
p173
aVSleeping at night enhances our creativity.
p174
aVAnd what seems to be going on is that, in the brain,
p175
aVthose neural connections that are important,
p176
aVthose synaptic connections that are important,
p177
aVare linked and strengthened,
p178
aVwhile those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important.
p179
aa(lp180
VOK.
p181
aVSo we've had three explanations for why we might sleep,
p182
aVand I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary,
p183
aVand it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.
p184
aVBut sleep is not an indulgence.
p185
aVIt's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually.
p186
aVI think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade
p187
aVfrom economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of.
p188
aVIt's not even an upgrade from economy to first class.
p189
aVThe critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep,
p190
aVyou don't fly.
p191
aVEssentially, you never get there.
p192
aVAnd what's extraordinary about much of our society these days
p193
aVis that we are desperately sleep-deprived.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo let's now look at sleep deprivation.
p196
aVHuge sectors of society are sleep-deprived,
p197
aVand let's look at our sleep-o-meter.
p198
aVSo in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us
p199
aVwere getting around eight hours of sleep a night.
p200
aVNowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night,
p201
aVso we're in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league.
p202
aVFor teenagers, it's worse, much worse.
p203
aVThey need nine hours for full brain performance,
p204
aVand many of them, on a school night, are only getting five hours of sleep.
p205
aVIt's simply not enough.
p206
aVIf we think about other sectors of society \u2014 the aged;
p207
aVif you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block
p208
aVis somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again,
p209
aVless than five hours a night.
p210
aa(lp211
VShift work.
p212
aVShift work is extraordinary,
p213
aVperhaps 20 percent of the working population,
p214
aVand the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night.
p215
aVIt's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us.
p216
aVSo when the poor old shift worker is going home
p217
aVto try and sleep during the day, desperately tired,
p218
aVthe body clock is saying, "Wake up. This is the time to be awake."
p219
aVSo the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker
p220
aVis usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region.
p221
aVAnd then, of course, tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag.
p222
aVSo who here has jet lag?
p223
aVWell, my goodness gracious.
p224
aVWell, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep,
p225
aVbecause that's what your brain is craving.
p226
aa(lp227
VOne of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps,
p228
aVthis involuntary falling asleep,
p229
aVand you have essentially no control over it.
p230
aVNow, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing,
p231
aVbut they can also be deadly.
p232
aVIt's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers
p233
aVwill fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life,
p234
aVand in the US, the statistics are pretty good:
p235
aV100,000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness,
p236
aVloss of vigilance, and falling asleep \u2014 a hundred thousand a year.
p237
aVIt's extraordinary.
p238
aVAt another level of terror,
p239
aVwe dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl
p240
aVand indeed the space shuttle Challenger,
p241
aVwhich was so tragically lost.
p242
aVAnd in the investigations that followed those disasters,
p243
aVpoor judgment as a result of extended shift work
p244
aVand loss of vigilance and tiredness
p245
aVwas attributed to a big chunk of those disasters.
p246
aVWhen you're tired and you lack sleep,
p247
aVyou have poor memory, you have poor creativity,
p248
aVyou have increased impulsiveness,
p249
aVand you have overall poor judgment.
p250
aVBut my friends, it's so much worse than that.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VIf you are a tired brain,
p255
aVthe brain is craving things to wake it up.
p256
aVSo drugs, stimulants.
p257
aVCaffeine represents the stimulant of choice
p258
aVacross much of the Western world.
p259
aVMuch of the day is fueled by caffeine,
p260
aVand if you're a really naughty tired brain, nicotine.
p261
aVOf course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants,
p262
aVand then, of course, it gets to 11 o'clock at night,
p263
aVand the brain says to itself,
p264
aV"Actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly.
p265
aVWhat do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired?"
p266
aVWell, of course, you then resort to alcohol.
p267
aVNow alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice,
p268
aVto use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.
p269
aVIt can actually ease the sleep transition.
p270
aVBut what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.
p271
aVA biological mimic for sleep,
p272
aVit sedates you.
p273
aVSo it actually harms some of the neural processing
p274
aVthat's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.
p275
aVSo it's a short-term acute measure,
p276
aVbut for goodness sake,
p277
aVdon't become addicted to alcohol
p278
aVas a way of getting to sleep every night.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnother connection between loss of sleep is weight gain.
p281
aVIf you sleep around about five hours or less every night,
p282
aVthen you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.
p283
aVWhat's the connection here?
p284
aVWell, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin,
p285
aVthe hunger hormone.
p286
aVGhrelin is released.
p287
aVIt gets to the brain.
p288
aVThe brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"
p289
aVand what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars.
p290
aVSo there's a link between tiredness
p291
aVand the metabolic predisposition for weight gain: stress.
p292
aVTired people are massively stressed.
p293
aVAnd one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory,
p294
aVwhich is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of.
p295
aVBut stress is so much more.
p296
aVSo, if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem,
p297
aVbut it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem.
p298
aVSustained stress leads to suppressed immunity.
p299
aVAnd so, tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection,
p300
aVand there's some very good studies
p301
aVshowing that shift workers, for example, have higher rates of cancer.
p302
aVIncreased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation.
p303
aVGlucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature
p304
aVand essentially you become glucose intolerant.
p305
aVTherefore, diabetes 2.
p306
aVStress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure.
p307
aVSo there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss
p308
aVthat are more than just a mildly impaired brain,
p309
aVwhich is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo at this point in the talk, this is a nice time to think,
p312
aV"Well, do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep?"
p313
aVSo a quick show of hands.
p314
aVWho feels that they're getting enough sleep here?
p315
aVOh. Well, that's pretty impressive.
p316
aVGood. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo most of us, of course, ask the question,
p319
aV"How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"
p320
aVWell, it's not rocket science.
p321
aVIf you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning,
p322
aVif you are taking a long time to get up,
p323
aVif you need lots of stimulants,
p324
aVif you're grumpy, if you're irritable,
p325
aVif you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable,
p326
aVchances are you are sleep-deprived.
p327
aVListen to them. Listen to yourself.
p328
aa(lp329
VWhat do you do?
p330
aVWell \u2014 and this is slightly offensive \u2014
p331
aVsleep for dummies.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VMake your bedroom a haven for sleep.
p336
aVThe first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can,
p337
aVand also make it slightly cool.
p338
aVVery important.
p339
aVActually, reduce your amount of light exposure
p340
aVat least half an hour before you go to bed.
p341
aVLight increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep.
p342
aVWhat's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed?
p343
aVWe stand in a massively lit bathroom,
p344
aVlooking into the mirror cleaning our teeth.
p345
aVIt's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep.
p346
aVTurn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers.
p347
aVTurn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain.
p348
aVTry not to drink caffeine too late in the day,
p349
aVideally not after lunch.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed,
p352
aVbut light exposure in the morning
p353
aVis very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle.
p354
aVSo seek out morning light.
p355
aVBasically, listen to yourself.
p356
aVWind down.
p357
aVDo those sorts of things
p358
aVthat you know are going to ease you off
p359
aVinto the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
p360
aa(lp361
VOK.
p362
aVThat's some facts. What about some myths?
p363
aa(lp364
VTeenagers are lazy.
p365
aVNo. Poor things.
p366
aVThey have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late,
p367
aVso give them a break.
p368
aa(lp369
VWe need eight hours of sleep a night.
p370
aVThat's an average.
p371
aVSome people need more. Some people need less.
p372
aVAnd what you need to do is listen to your body.
p373
aVDo you need that much or do you need more?
p374
aVSimple as that.
p375
aa(lp376
VOld people need less sleep.
p377
aVNot true.
p378
aVThe sleep demands of the aged do not go down.
p379
aVEssentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust,
p380
aVbut sleep requirements do not go down.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd the fourth myth is early to bed, early to rise
p383
aVmakes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
p384
aVWell, that's wrong at so many different levels.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VThere is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early
p389
aVgives you more wealth at all.
p390
aVThere's no difference in socioeconomic status.
p391
aVIn my experience,
p392
aVthe only difference between morning people and evening people
p393
aVis that those people that get up in the morning early
p394
aVare just horribly smug.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
V(Applause)
p399
aa(lp400
VOK.
p401
aVSo for the last few minutes,
p402
aVwhat I want to do is change gears
p403
aVand talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience,
p404
aVwhich is the association between mental health,
p405
aVmental illness and sleep disruption.
p406
aVWe've known for 130 years that in severe mental illness,
p407
aVthere is always, always sleep disruption,
p408
aVbut it's been largely ignored.
p409
aVIn the 1970s, when people started to think about this again,
p410
aVthey said, "Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia,
p411
aVbecause they're on antipsychotics.
p412
aVIt's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems,"
p413
aVignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously,
p414
aVsleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo what's going on?
p417
aVSeveral groups are studying
p418
aVconditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar
p419
aVand what's going on in terms of sleep disruption.
p420
aVWe have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia,
p421
aVand the data were quite extraordinary.
p422
aVIn those individuals with schizophrenia,
p423
aVmuch of the time, they were awake during the night phase
p424
aVand then they were asleep during the day.
p425
aVOther groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever \u2014
p426
aVtheir sleep was absolutely smashed.
p427
aVAnd some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle.
p428
aVThey were getting up later and later and later and later each night.
p429
aVIt was smashed.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo what's going on?
p432
aVAnd the really exciting news
p433
aVis that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated,
p434
aVbut they are physically linked within the brain.
p435
aVThe neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep,
p436
aVgive you normal sleep,
p437
aVand those that give you normal mental health, are overlapping.
p438
aVAnd what's the evidence for that?
p439
aVWell, genes that have been shown
p440
aVto be very important in the generation of normal sleep,
p441
aVwhen mutated, when changed,
p442
aValso predispose individuals to mental health problems.
p443
aVAnd last year, we published a study
p444
aVwhich showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia,
p445
aVwhen mutated, also smashes the sleep.
p446
aVSo we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap
p447
aVbetween these two important systems.
p448
aa(lp449
VOther work flowed from these studies.
p450
aVThe first was that sleep disruption
p451
aVactually precedes certain types of mental illness,
p452
aVand we've shown that in those young individuals
p453
aVwho are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder,
p454
aVthey already have a sleep abnormality
p455
aVprior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar.
p456
aVThe other bit of data was that sleep disruption
p457
aVmay actually exacerbate, make worse, the mental illness state.
p458
aVMy colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents
p459
aVwhich have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia
p460
aVin those individuals by 50 percent.
p461
aa(lp462
VSo what have we got?
p463
aVWe've got, in these connections, some really exciting things.
p464
aVIn terms of the neuroscience,
p465
aVby understanding these two systems,
p466
aVwe're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness
p467
aVare generated and regulated within the brain.
p468
aVThe second area is that if we can use sleep
p469
aVand sleep disruption as an early warning signal,
p470
aVthen we have the chance of going in.
p471
aVIf we know these individuals are vulnerable,
p472
aVearly intervention then becomes possible.
p473
aVAnd the third, which I think is the most exciting,
p474
aVis that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain
p475
aVas a new therapeutic target.
p476
aVStabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable,
p477
aVwe can certainly make them healthier,
p478
aVbut also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness.
p479
aa(lp480
VSo let me just finish.
p481
aVWhat I started by saying is: Take sleep seriously.
p482
aVOur attitudes toward sleep are so very different
p483
aVfrom a pre-industrial age,
p484
aVwhen we were almost wrapped in a duvet.
p485
aVWe used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep.
p486
aVAnd this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense.
p487
aVThis is a pragmatic response to good health.
p488
aVIf you have good sleep, it increases your concentration,
p489
aVattention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health.
p490
aVIf you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress,
p491
aVyour levels of anger, your impulsivity,
p492
aVand your tendency to drink and take drugs.
p493
aVAnd we finished by saying
p494
aVthat an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep
p495
aVis really informing the way we think
p496
aVabout some of the causes of mental illness,
p497
aVand indeed is providing us new ways
p498
aVto treat these incredibly debilitating conditions.
p499
aa(lp500
VJim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,
p501
aV"Sleep is God. Go worship."
p502
aVAnd I can only recommend that you do the same.
