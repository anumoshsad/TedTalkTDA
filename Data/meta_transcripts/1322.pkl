VWhat I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines
p4
aVthat create the living fabric of your body.
p5
aVNow molecules are really, really tiny.
p6
aVAnd by tiny, I mean really.
p7
aVThey're smaller than a wavelength of light,
p8
aVso we have no way to directly observe them.
p9
aVBut through science, we do have a fairly good idea
p10
aVof what's going on down at the molecular scale.
p11
aVSo what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules,
p12
aVbut we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules.
p13
aa(lp14
VOne way around this is to draw pictures.
p15
aVAnd this idea is actually nothing new.
p16
aVScientists have always created pictures
p17
aVas part of their thinking and discovery process.
p18
aVThey draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes,
p19
aVthrough technology like telescopes and microscopes,
p20
aVand also what they're thinking about in their minds.
p21
aVI picked two well-known examples,
p22
aVbecause they're very well-known for expressing science through art.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I start with Galileo, who used the world's first telescope
p25
aVto look at the Moon.
p26
aVAnd he transformed our understanding of the Moon.
p27
aVThe perception in the 17th century
p28
aVwas the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere.
p29
aVBut what Galileo saw was a rocky, barren world,
p30
aVwhich he expressed through his watercolor painting.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnother scientist with very big ideas,
p33
aVthe superstar of biology is Charles Darwin.
p34
aVAnd with this famous entry in his notebook,
p35
aVhe begins in the top left-hand corner with, "I think,"
p36
aVand then sketches out the first tree of life,
p37
aVwhich is his perception of how all the species,
p38
aVall living things on Earth are connected through evolutionary history \u2014
p39
aVthe origin of species through natural selection
p40
aVand divergence from an ancestral population.
p41
aa(lp42
VEven as a scientist,
p43
aVI used to go to lectures by molecular biologists
p44
aVand find them completely incomprehensible,
p45
aVwith all the fancy technical language and jargon
p46
aVthat they would use in describing their work,
p47
aVuntil I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell,
p48
aVwho is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute.
p49
aVAnd his pictures \u2014 everything's accurate and it's all to scale.
p50
aVAnd his work illuminated for me
p51
aVwhat the molecular world inside us is like.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo this is a transection through blood.
p54
aVIn the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area.
p55
aVThe yellow-green area is the fluid of blood, which is mostly water,
p56
aVbut it's also antibodies, sugars, hormones, that kind of thing.
p57
aVAnd the red region is a slice into a red blood cell.
p58
aVAnd those red molecules are hemoglobin.
p59
aVThey are actually red; that's what gives blood its color.
p60
aVAnd hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge
p61
aVto soak up the oxygen in your lungs
p62
aVand then carry it to other parts of the body.
p63
aa(lp64
VI was very much inspired by this image many years ago,
p65
aVand I wondered whether we could use computer graphics
p66
aVto represent the molecular world.
p67
aVWhat would it look like?
p68
aVAnd that's how I really began.
p69
aVSo let's begin.
p70
aa(lp71
VThis is DNA in its classic double helix form.
p72
aVAnd it's from X-ray crystallography, so it's an accurate model of DNA.
p73
aVIf we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands,
p74
aVyou see these things that look like teeth.
p75
aVThose are the letters of genetic code,
p76
aVthe 25,000 genes you've got written in your DNA.
p77
aVThis is what they typically talk about \u2014 the genetic code \u2014
p78
aVthis is what they're talking about.
p79
aVBut I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science,
p80
aVand that is the physical nature of DNA.
p81
aVIt's these two strands that run in opposite directions
p82
aVfor reasons I can't go into right now.
p83
aVBut they physically run in opposite directions,
p84
aVwhich creates a number of complications for your living cells,
p85
aVas you're about to see,
p86
aVmost particularly when DNA is being copied.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd so what I'm about to show you
p89
aVis an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine
p90
aVthat's occurring right now inside your body,
p91
aVat least 2002 biology.
p92
aVSo DNA's entering the production line from the left-hand side,
p93
aVand it hits this collection, these miniature biochemical machines,
p94
aVthat are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy.
p95
aVSo DNA comes in and hits this blue, doughnut-shaped structure
p96
aVand it's ripped apart into its two strands.
p97
aVOne strand can be copied directly,
p98
aVand you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there.
p99
aVBut things aren't so simple for the other strand
p100
aVbecause it must be copied backwards.
p101
aVSo it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops
p102
aVand copied one section at a time, creating two new DNA molecules.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you,
p105
aVcopying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.
p106
aVIt's an accurate representation,
p107
aVand it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you.
p108
aVI've left out error correction and a bunch of other things.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VThis was work from a number of years ago\u2014
p113
aVThank you.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VThis is work from a number of years ago,
p118
aVbut what I'll show you next is updated science,
p119
aVit's updated technology.
p120
aVSo again, we begin with DNA.
p121
aVAnd it's jiggling and wiggling there
p122
aVbecause of the surrounding soup of molecules,
p123
aVwhich I've stripped away so you can see something.
p124
aVDNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny.
p125
aVBut in each one of your cells,
p126
aVeach strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long.
p127
aVSo to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code,
p128
aVit's wrapped around these purple proteins \u2014
p129
aVor I've labeled them purple here.
p130
aVIt's packaged up and bundled up.
p131
aVAll this field of view is a single strand of DNA.
p132
aVThis huge package of DNA is called a chromosome.
p133
aVAnd we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute.
p134
aa(lp135
VWe're pulling out, we're zooming out,
p136
aVout through a nuclear pore,
p137
aVwhich is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA,
p138
aVcalled the nucleus.
p139
aVAll of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology,
p140
aVand I've got seven minutes,
p141
aVSo we're not going to be able to do that today?
p142
aVNo, I'm being told, "No."
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope.
p145
aVAnd it's been filmed under time-lapse, which is why you can see it moving.
p146
aVThe nuclear envelope breaks down.
p147
aVThese sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes,
p148
aVand we'll focus on them.
p149
aVThey go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots.
p150
aVWhen the cell feels it's ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome.
p151
aVOne set of DNA goes to one side,
p152
aVthe other side gets the other set of DNA \u2014
p153
aVidentical copies of DNA.
p154
aVAnd then the cell splits down the middle.
p155
aVAnd again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process
p156
aVright now inside of you.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes,
p159
aVand look at its structure and describe it.
p160
aVSo again, here we are at that equator moment.
p161
aVThe chromosomes line up.
p162
aVAnd if we isolate just one chromosome,
p163
aVwe're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure.
p164
aVSo this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have,
p165
aVat least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us.
p166
aVSo this is a single chromosome.
p167
aVAnd you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome.
p168
aVOne is bundled up into one sausage.
p169
aVThe other strand is bundled up into the other sausage.
p170
aa(lp171
VThese things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side
p172
aVare the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.
p173
aVThey're called microtubules, that name's not important.
p174
aVBut we're going to focus on the region labeled red here \u2014
p175
aVand it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding
p176
aVand the chromosomes.
p177
aVIt is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes.
p178
aVWe have no idea, really, as to how it's achieving that movement.
p179
aa(lp180
VWe've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore
p181
aVfor over a hundred years with intense study,
p182
aVand we're still just beginning to discover what it's about.
p183
aVIt is made up of about 200 different types of proteins,
p184
aVthousands of proteins in total.
p185
aVIt is a signal broadcasting system.
p186
aVIt broadcasts through chemical signals,
p187
aVtelling the rest of the cell when it's ready,
p188
aVwhen it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go
p189
aVfor the separation of the chromosomes.
p190
aVIt is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules.
p191
aa(lp192
VIt's involved with the growing of the microtubules,
p193
aVand it's able to transiently couple onto them.
p194
aVIt's also an attention-sensing system.
p195
aVIt's able to feel when the cell is ready,
p196
aVwhen the chromosome is correctly positioned.
p197
aVIt's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right.
p198
aVAnd you'll see, there's this one little last bit
p199
aVthat's still remaining red.
p200
aVAnd it's walked away down the microtubules.
p201
aVThat is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal.
p202
aVAnd it's walked away \u2014 I mean, it's that mechanical.
p203
aVIt's molecular clockwork.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is how you work at the molecular scale.
p206
aVSo with a little bit of molecular eye candy,
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
Vwe've got kinesins, the orange ones.
p211
aVThey're little molecular courier molecules walking one way.
p212
aVAnd here are the dynein, they're carrying that broadcasting system.
p213
aVAnd they've got their long legs
p214
aVso they can step around obstacles and so on.
p215
aVSo again, this is all derived accurately from the science.
p216
aVThe problem is we can't show it to you any other way.
p217
aa(lp218
VExploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding,
p219
aVis mind-blowing.
p220
aVDiscovering this stuff
p221
aVis certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science.
p222
aVBut most medical researchers \u2014
p223
aVdiscovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals,
p224
aVwhich are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering
p225
aVand the misery that disease causes
p226
aVand to lift people out of poverty.
p227
