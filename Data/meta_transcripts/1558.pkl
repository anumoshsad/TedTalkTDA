VSo when the White House was built
p4
aVin the early 19th century, it was an open house.
p5
aVNeighbors came and went. Under President Adams,
p6
aVa local dentist happened by.
p7
aVHe wanted to shake the President's hand.
p8
aVThe President dismissed the Secretary of State,
p9
aVwhom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist
p10
aVif he would remove a tooth.
p11
aVLater, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,
p12
aVhe was known to have remarked
p13
aV\u2014 probably the only thing he's known for \u2014
p14
aVwhen a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see
p15
aVthe beautiful house," and Pierce said to him,
p16
aV"Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
p17
aVThis isn't my house. It is the people's house."
p18
aa(lp19
VWell, when I got to the White House in the beginning
p20
aVof 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,
p21
aVthe White House was anything but open.
p22
aVBomb blast curtains covered my windows.
p23
aVWe were running Windows 2000.
p24
aVSocial media were blocked at the firewall.
p25
aVWe didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts
p26
aVlike we have today.
p27
aVI came in to become the head of Open Government,
p28
aVto take the values and the practices of transparency,
p29
aVparticipation and collaboration, and instill them
p30
aVinto the way that we work, to open up government,
p31
aVto work with people.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow one of the things that we know
p34
aVis that companies are very good at getting people to work
p35
aVtogether in teams and in networks to make
p36
aVvery complex products, like cars and computers,
p37
aVand the more complex the products are a society creates,
p38
aVthe more successful the society is over time.
p39
aVCompanies make goods, but governments,
p40
aVthey make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer
p41
aVand educating our children and making roads,
p42
aVbut we don't have institutions that are particularly good
p43
aVat this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions
p44
aVthat are good at bringing our talents to bear,
p45
aVat working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,
p48
aVwhat did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector
p49
aVemployees how we should open up government.
p50
aVTurns out that had never been done before.
p51
aVWe wanted to ask members of the public to help us
p52
aVcome up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting
p53
aVon a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,
p54
aVbut in advance. There was no legal precedent,
p55
aVno cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.
p56
aVIn fact, many people told us it was illegal.
p57
aa(lp58
VHere's the crux of the obstacle.
p59
aVGovernments exist to channel the flow of two things,
p60
aVreally, values and expertise to and from government
p61
aVand to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
p62
aVBut the way that our institutions are designed,
p63
aVin our rather 18th-century, centralized model,
p64
aVis to channel the flow of values through voting,
p65
aVonce every four years, once every two years, at best,
p66
aVonce a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this
p67
aVera of social media, for us to actually express our values.
p68
aVToday we have technology that lets us express ourselves
p69
aVa great deal, perhaps a little too much.
p70
aa(lp71
VThen in the 19th century, we layer on
p72
aVthe concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state
p73
aVto help us govern complex and large societies.
p74
aVBut we've centralized these bureaucracies.
p75
aVWe've entrenched them. And we know that
p76
aVthe smartest person always works for someone else.
p77
aVWe need to only look around this room to know that
p78
aVexpertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,
p79
aVand not limited simply to our institutions.
p80
aa(lp81
VScientists have been studying in recent years
p82
aVthe phenomenon that they often describe as flow,
p83
aVthat the design of our systems, whether natural or social,
p84
aVchannel the flow of whatever runs through them.
p85
aVSo a river is designed to channel the flow of water,
p86
aVand the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels
p87
aVthe flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel
p88
aVthe flow of nutrients to the tree,
p89
aVsometimes even having to route around an obstacle,
p90
aVbut to get that nutrition flowing.
p91
aVThe same can be said for our social systems, for our
p92
aVsystems of government, where, at the very least,
p93
aVflow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding
p94
aVwhat the problem is, what's really broken,
p95
aVand the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,
p96
aVto redesign the flow of our institutions.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,
p99
aVand we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions
p100
aVthat are actually quite recent.
p101
aVThink about it: What other business do you know,
p102
aVwhat other sector of the economy, and especially one
p103
aVas big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent
p104
aVits business model on a regular basis?
p105
aVSure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest
p106
aVin broadband and science education and science grants,
p107
aVbut we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning
p108
aVthe institutions that we have.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, it's very easy to complain, of course, about
p111
aVpartisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love
p112
aVto complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,
p113
aVespecially around election time, but
p114
aVthe world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,
p115
aVmany of whom will lack basic resources.
p116
aVSo complain as we might, what actually can replace
p117
aVwhat we have today?
p118
aVWhat comes the day after the Arab Spring?
p119
aa(lp120
VWell, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself
p121
aVto us is that of networks. Right? Networks
p122
aVlike Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.
p123
aVYou've got 3,000 employees at Facebook
p124
aVgoverning 900 million inhabitants.
p125
aVWe might even call them citizens, because they've recently
p126
aVrisen up to fight against legislative incursion,
p127
aVand the citizens of these networks work together
p128
aVto serve each other in great ways.
p129
aVBut private communities, private, corporate,
p130
aVprivatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
p131
aVThey cannot replace government.
p132
aVFriending someone on Facebook is not complex enough
p133
aVto do the hard work of you and I collaborating
p134
aVwith each other and doing the hard work of governance.
p135
aVBut social media do teach us something.
p136
aVWhy is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
p137
aVIt opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands
p138
aVof new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can
p139
aVread and process information in new and exciting ways.
p140
aVWe need to think about how to open up the API
p141
aVof government, and the way that we're going to do that,
p142
aVthe next great superpower is going to be the one
p143
aVwho can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution \u2014
p144
aVbecause we have to maintain those public values,
p145
aVwe have to coordinate the flow \u2014 but with the diversity
p146
aVand the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement
p147
aVof networks, all of us working together to build
p148
aVthese new innovations on top of our institutions,
p149
aVto engage in the practice of governance.
p150
aa(lp151
VWe have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,
p152
aVin the 12th century, invented the jury.
p153
aVPowerful, practical, palpable model for handing power
p154
aVfrom government to citizens.
p155
aVToday we have the opportunity, and we have
p156
aVthe imperative, to create thousands of new ways
p157
aVof interconnecting between networks and institutions,
p158
aVthousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,
p159
aVthe Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning
p160
aVto invent the models by which we can cocreate
p161
aVthe process of governance.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like
p164
aVyet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution
p165
aVemerging all around us \u2014 maybe not even evolution,
p166
aVI'd even start to call it a revolution \u2014 in the way that we govern.
p167
aVSome of it's very high-tech,
p168
aVand some of it is extremely low-tech,
p169
aVsuch as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,
p170
aVIndia, where they take the spending data of the state
p171
aVand paint it on 100,000 village walls,
p172
aVand then invite the villagers to come and comment
p173
aVwho is on the government payroll, who's actually died,
p174
aVwhat are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,
p175
aVand to work together through civic engagement to save
p176
aVreal money and participate and have access to that budget.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut it's not just about policing government.
p179
aVIt's also about creating government.
p180
aVSpacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,
p181
aVgetting you and me to raise the money to build
p182
aVthe goalposts and the park benches that will actually
p183
aVallow us to deliver better services in our communities.
p184
aVNo one is better at this activity of actually getting us
p185
aVto engage in delivering services,
p186
aVsometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
p187
aVCreated after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,
p188
aVthis crisis-mapping website and community is actually able
p189
aVto crowdsource and target the delivery of
p190
aVbetter rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,
p191
aVwhether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,
p192
aVor more recently in Italy.
p193
aVAnd the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter
p194
aVis certifying them, not simply to supplement existing
p195
aVgovernment institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,
p198
aVis the opening up of government data,
p199
aVnot enough examples of this yet, but we're starting
p200
aVto see this practice of people creating and generating
p201
aVinnovative applications on top of government data.
p202
aVThere's so many examples I could have picked, and I
p203
aVselected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you
p204
aVmay or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen
p205
aVin New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless
p206
aVand particularly homeless veterans.
p207
aVIn February, he approached the White House, and said,
p208
aV"I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national
p209
aVapplications, apps, that will help not only the homeless
p210
aVbut those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."
p211
aVFebruary 2012 to June of 2012,
p212
aVthe finalists are announced in the competition.
p213
aVCan you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,
p214
aVgetting anything done in a four-month period of time?
p215
aVYou can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,
p216
aVlet alone generate real, palpable innovations
p217
aVthat improve people's lives.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd I want to be clear to mention that this open government
p220
aVrevolution is not about privatizing government,
p221
aVbecause in many cases what it can do when we have
p222
aVthe will to do so is to deliver more progressive
p223
aVand better policy than the regulations and the legislative
p224
aVand litigation-oriented strategies
p225
aVby which we make policy today.
p226
aVIn the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,
p227
aVfrom well-driller to florist.
p228
aVNow, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,
p229
aVbut do not make a flower arrangement without a license,
p230
aVbecause that will land you in jail.
p231
aVSo what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,
p232
aVusing online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of
p233
aVburdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,
p234
aVbut to replace those regulations with more innovative
p235
aValternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation
p236
aVof new iPhone apps that will allows us
p237
aVboth to protect consumers and the public
p238
aVand to encourage economic development.
p239
aa(lp240
VThat is a nice sideline of open government.
p241
aVIt's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard
p242
aVto development. It's the economic benefits and the
p243
aVjob creation that's coming from this open innovation work.
p244
aVSberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,
p245
aVlargely owned by the Russian government,
p246
aVhas started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging
p247
aVits employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
p248
aVLast year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,
p249
aVfrom open innovation, and they're pushing radically
p250
aVthe extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,
p251
aVbut into the public sector.
p252
aVAnd we see lots of examples of these innovators using
p253
aVopen government data, not simply to make apps,
p254
aVbut then to make companies and to hire people
p255
aVto build them working with the government.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo a lot of these innovations are local.
p258
aVIn San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app
p259
aVin which they allow you or me to say we are certified
p260
aVCPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,
p261
aVa notification goes out so that you
p262
aVcan rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
p263
aVThe victim who receives bystander CPR
p264
aVis more than twice as likely to survive.
p265
aV"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut it's not limited to the local.
p268
aVBritish Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue
p269
aVof all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage
p270
aVwith the state in the cocreation of governance.
p271
aa(lp272
VLet me be very clear,
p273
aVand perhaps controversial,
p274
aVthat open government is not
p275
aVabout transparent government.
p276
aVSimply throwing data over the transom doesn't change
p277
aVhow government works.
p278
aVIt doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data
p279
aVto change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change
p280
aVgovernment.
p281
aVWhat it does is it creates an adversarial relationship
p282
aVbetween civil society and government
p283
aVover the control and ownership of information.
p284
aVAnd transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow
p285
aVof money into politics, and arguably,
p286
aVit's not even producing accountability as well as it might
p287
aVif we took the next step of combining participation and
p288
aVcollaboration with transparency to transform how we work.
p289
aa(lp290
VWe're going to see this evolution really in two phases,
p291
aVI think. The first phase of the open government revolution
p292
aVis delivering better information from the crowd
p293
aVinto the center.
p294
aVStarting in 2005, and this is how this open government
p295
aVwork in the U.S. really got started,
p296
aVI was teaching a patent law class to my students and
p297
aVexplaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy
p298
aVhas the power to make a decision
p299
aVabout which patent application becomes the next patent,
p300
aVand therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights
p301
aVover an entire field of inventive activity.
p302
aVWell, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,
p303
aVwe can make an expert network, a social network,
p304
aVthat would connect the network to the institution
p305
aVto allow scientists and technologists to get
p306
aVbetter information to the patent office
p307
aVto aid in making those decisions.
p308
aVWe piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan
p309
aVand Australia, and now I'm pleased to report
p310
aVthat the United States Patent Office will be rolling out
p311
aVuniversal, complete, and total openness,
p312
aVso that all patent applications will now be open
p313
aVfor citizen participation, beginning this year.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe second phase of this evolution \u2014 Yeah. (Applause)
p316
aVThey deserve a hand. (Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VThe first phase is in getting better information in.
p319
aVThe second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
p320
aVParticipatory budgeting has long been practiced
p321
aVin Porto Alegre, Brazil.
p322
aVThey're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.
p323
aVRussia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,
p324
aVas is Lithuania. When we start to see
p325
aVpower over the core functions of government
p326
aV\u2014 spending, legislation, decision-making \u2014
p327
aVthen we're well on our way to an open government revolution.
p328
aa(lp329
VThere are many things that we can do to get us there.
p330
aVObviously opening up the data is one,
p331
aVbut the important thing is to create lots more \u2014
p332
aVcreate and curate \u2014 lots more participatory opportunities.
p333
aVHackathons and mashathons and working with data
p334
aVto build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage
p335
aVand participate, like the jury is,
p336
aVbut we're going to need lots more things like it.
p337
aVAnd that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
p338
aVWe've heard talk here at TED about people
p339
aVbiohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,
p340
aVand Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting
p341
aVyoung people to build websites and make videos.
p342
aVWhen we start by teaching young people that we live,
p343
aVnot in a passive society, a read-only society,
p344
aVbut in a writable society, where we have the power
p345
aVto change our communities, to change our institutions,
p346
aVthat's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway
p347
aVtowards this open government innovation,
p348
aVtowards this open government movement,
p349
aVtowards this open government revolution.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo let me close by saying that I think the important thing
p352
aVfor us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
p353
aVWe don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
p354
aVWords like equality and fairness and the traditional
p355
aVelections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
p356
aVThey're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough
p357
aVto get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity
p358
aVthat awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see
p359
aVthe kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting
p360
aVinnovations that we hear talked about here at TED,
p361
aVin clean energy, in clean education,
p362
aVin development, if we want to see those adopted
p363
aVand we want to see those scaled,
p364
aVwe want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,
p365
aVthen we must all participate,
p366
aVthen we must get involved.
p367
aVWe must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,
p368
aVwe must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,
p369
aVthroughout our culture, to create open institutions
p370
aVto create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.
p371
aVThank you. (Applause)
