VHere's an intriguing fact.
p4
aVIn the developed world,
p5
aVeverywhere, women live an average of six to eight years longer than men do.
p6
aVSix to eight years longer.
p7
aVThat's, like, a huge gap.
p8
aVIn 2015, the "Lancet" published an article
p9
aVshowing that men in rich countries
p10
aVare twice as likely to die as women are
p11
aVat any age.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut there is one place in the world
p14
aVwhere men live as long as women.
p15
aVIt's a remote, mountainous zone,
p16
aVa blue zone,
p17
aVwhere super longevity
p18
aVis common to both sexes.
p19
aVThis is the blue zone in Sardinia,
p20
aVan Italian island in the Mediterranean,
p21
aVbetween Corsica and Tunisia,
p22
aVwhere there are six times as many centenarians
p23
aVas on the Italian mainland,
p24
aVless than 200 miles away.
p25
aVThere are 10 times as many centenarians
p26
aVas there are in North America.
p27
aVIt's the only place where men live as long as women.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut why?
p30
aVMy curiosity was piqued.
p31
aVI decided to research the science and the habits of the place,
p32
aVand I started with the genetic profile.
p33
aVI discovered soon enough
p34
aVthat genes account for just 25 percent of their longevity.
p35
aVThe other 75 percent is lifestyle.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo what does it take to live to 100 or beyond?
p38
aVWhat are they doing right?
p39
aVWhat you're looking at is an aerial view of Villagrande.
p40
aVIt's a village at the epicenter of the blue zone
p41
aVwhere I went to investigate this,
p42
aVand as you can see, architectural beauty is not its main virtue,
p43
aVdensity is:
p44
aVtightly spaced houses,
p45
aVinterwoven alleys and streets.
p46
aVIt means that the villagers' lives constantly intersect.
p47
aVAnd as I walked through the village,
p48
aVI could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me
p49
aVfrom behind doorways and curtains,
p50
aVfrom behind shutters.
p51
aVBecause like all ancient villages,
p52
aVVillagrande couldn't have survived
p53
aVwithout this structure, without its walls, without its cathedral,
p54
aVwithout its village square,
p55
aVbecause defense and social cohesion defined its design.
p56
aa(lp57
VUrban priorities changed as we moved towards the industrial revolution
p58
aVbecause infectious disease became the risk of the day.
p59
aVBut what about now?
p60
aVNow, social isolation is the public health risk of our time.
p61
aVNow, a third of the population says
p62
aVthey have two or fewer people to lean on.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut let's go to Villagrande now as a contrast
p65
aVto meet some centenarians.
p66
aa(lp67
VMeet Giuseppe Murinu. He's 102, a supercentenarian
p68
aVand a lifelong resident of the village of Villagrande.
p69
aVHe was a gregarious man.
p70
aVHe loved to recount stories
p71
aVsuch as how he lived like a bird
p72
aVfrom what he could find on the forest floor
p73
aVduring not one but two world wars,
p74
aVhow he and his wife, who also lived past 100,
p75
aVraised six children in a small, homey kitchen
p76
aVwhere I interviewed him.
p77
aVHere he is with his sons Angelo and Domenico,
p78
aVboth in their 70s and looking after their father,
p79
aVand who were quite frankly very suspicious of me and my daughter
p80
aVwho came along with me on this research trip,
p81
aVbecause the flip side of social cohesion
p82
aVis a wariness of strangers and outsiders.
p83
aVBut Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.
p84
aVHe was a happy-go-lucky guy,
p85
aVvery outgoing with a positive outlook.
p86
aVAnd I wondered: so is that what it takes to live to be 100 or beyond,
p87
aVthinking positively?
p88
aVActually, no.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VMeet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,
p93
aVthe grumpiest person I have ever met.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd he put a lie to the notion
p98
aVthat you have to be positive to live a long life.
p99
aVAnd there is evidence for this.
p100
aVWhen I asked him why he lived so long,
p101
aVhe kind of looked at me under hooded eyelids and he growled,
p102
aV"Nobody has to know my secrets."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VBut despite being a sourpuss,
p107
aVthe niece who lived with him and looked after him
p108
aVcalled him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure."
p109
aVAnd she respected him and loved him,
p110
aVand she told me, when I questioned this obvious loss of her freedom,
p111
aV"You just don't understand, do you?
p112
aVLooking after this man is a pleasure.
p113
aVIt's a huge privilege for me.
p114
aVThis is my heritage."
p115
aVAnd indeed, wherever I went to interview these centenarians,
p116
aVI found a kitchen party.
p117
aVHere's Giovanni with his two nieces,
p118
aVMaria above him
p119
aVand beside him his great-niece Sara,
p120
aVwho came when I was there to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.
p121
aVAnd I quickly discovered by being there
p122
aVthat in the blue zone, as people age,
p123
aVand indeed across their lifespans,
p124
aVthey're always surrounded by extended family, by friends,
p125
aVby neighbors, the priest, the barkeeper, the grocer.
p126
aVPeople are always there or dropping by.
p127
aVThey are never left to live solitary lives.
p128
aVThis is unlike the rest of the developed world,
p129
aVwhere as George Burns quipped,
p130
aV"Happiness is having a large, loving, caring family in another city."
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, so far we've only met men,
p135
aVlong-living men, but I met women too,
p136
aVand here you see Zia Teresa.
p137
aVShe, at over 100, taught me how to make the local specialty,
p138
aVwhich is called culurgiones,
p139
aVwhich are these large pasta pockets
p140
aVlike ravioli about this size,
p141
aVthis size,
p142
aVand they're filled with high-fat ricotta and mint
p143
aVand drenched in tomato sauce.
p144
aVAnd she showed me how to make just the right crimp
p145
aVso they wouldn't open,
p146
aVand she makes them with her daughters every Sunday
p147
aVand distributes them by the dozens to neighbors and friends.
p148
aVAnd that's when I discovered a low-fat, gluten-free diet
p149
aVis not what it takes to live to 100 in the blue zone.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, these centenarians' stories along with the science that underpins them
p154
aVprompted me to ask myself some questions too,
p155
aVsuch as, when am I going to die and how can I put that day off?
p156
aVAnd as you will see, the answer is not what we expect.
p157
aVJulianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher at Brigham Young University
p158
aVand she addressed this very question
p159
aVin a series of studies
p160
aVof tens of thousands of middle aged people
p161
aVmuch like this audience here.
p162
aVAnd she looked at every aspect of their lifestyle:
p163
aVtheir diet, their exercise,
p164
aVtheir marital status,
p165
aVhow often they went to the doctor,
p166
aVwhether they smoked or drank, etc.
p167
aVShe recorded all of this
p168
aVand then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years
p169
aVto see who would still be breathing.
p170
aVAnd of the people left standing,
p171
aVwhat reduced their chances of dying the most?
p172
aVThat was her question.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo let's now look at her data in summary,
p175
aVgoing from the least powerful predictor to the strongest.
p176
aVOK?
p177
aVSo clean air, which is great,
p178
aVit doesn't predict how long you will live.
p179
aVWhether you have your hypertension treated
p180
aVis good.
p181
aVStill not a strong predictor.
p182
aVWhether you're lean or overweight, you can stop feeling guilty about this,
p183
aVbecause it's only in third place.
p184
aVHow much exercise you get is next,
p185
aVstill only a moderate predictor.
p186
aVWhether you've had a cardiac event and you're in rehab and exercising,
p187
aVgetting higher now.
p188
aVWhether you've had a flu vaccine.
p189
aVDid anybody here know
p190
aVthat having a flu vaccine protects you more than doing exercise?
p191
aVWhether you were drinking and quit,
p192
aVor whether you're a moderate drinker,
p193
aVwhether you don't smoke, or if you did, whether you quit,
p194
aVand getting towards the top predictors
p195
aVare two features of your social life.
p196
aVFirst, your close relationships.
p197
aVThese are the people that you can call on for a loan
p198
aVif you need money suddenly,
p199
aVwho will call the doctor if you're not feeling well
p200
aVor who will take you to the hospital,
p201
aVor who will sit with you if you're having an existential crisis,
p202
aVif you're in despair.
p203
aVThose people, that little clutch of people
p204
aVare a strong predictor, if you have them, of how long you'll live.
p205
aVAnd then something that surprised me,
p206
aVsomething that's called social integration.
p207
aVThis means how much you interact with people
p208
aVas you move through your day.
p209
aVHow many people do you talk to?
p210
aVAnd these mean both your weak and your strong bonds,
p211
aVso not just the people you're really close to,
p212
aVwho mean a lot to you,
p213
aVbut, like, do you talk to the guy who every day makes you your coffee?
p214
aVDo you talk to the postman?
p215
aVDo you talk to the woman who walks by your house every day with her dog?
p216
aVDo you play bridge or poker, have a book club?
p217
aVThose interactions are one of the strongest predictors
p218
aVof how long you'll live.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, this leads me to the next question:
p221
aVif we now spend more time online than on any other activity,
p222
aVincluding sleeping,
p223
aVwe're now up to 11 hours a day,
p224
aVone hour more than last year, by the way,
p225
aVdoes it make a difference?
p226
aVWhy distinguish between interacting in person
p227
aVand interacting via social media?
p228
aVIs it the same thing as being there
p229
aVif you're in contact constantly with your kids through text, for example?
p230
aVWell, the short answer to the question is no,
p231
aVit's not the same thing.
p232
aVFace-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,
p233
aVand like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present
p234
aVand well into the future.
p235
aVSo simply making eye contact with somebody,
p236
aVshaking hands, giving somebody a high-five
p237
aVis enough to release oxytocin,
p238
aVwhich increases your level of trust
p239
aVand it lowers your cortisol levels.
p240
aVSo it lowers your stress.
p241
aVAnd dopamine is generated, which gives us a little high
p242
aVand it kills pain.
p243
aVIt's like a naturally produced morphine.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow, all of this passes under our conscious radar,
p246
aVwhich is why we conflate online activity with the real thing.
p247
aVBut we do have evidence now, fresh evidence,
p248
aVthat there is a difference.
p249
aVSo let's look at some of the neuroscience.
p250
aVElizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland,
p251
aVtried to map the difference
p252
aVbetween what goes on in our brains when we interact in person
p253
aVversus when we're watching something that's static.
p254
aVAnd what she did was she compared the brain function
p255
aVof two groups of people,
p256
aVthose interacting live with her
p257
aVor with one of her research associates
p258
aVin a dynamic conversation,
p259
aVand she compared that to the brain activity of people
p260
aVwho were watching her talk about the same subject
p261
aVbut in a canned video, like on YouTube.
p262
aVAnd by the way, if you want to know
p263
aVhow she fit two people in an MRI scanner at the same time,
p264
aVtalk to me later.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what's the difference?
p267
aVThis is your brain on real social interaction.
p268
aVWhat you're seeing is the difference in brain activity
p269
aVbetween interacting in person and taking in static content.
p270
aVIn orange, you see the brain areas that are associated with attention,
p271
aVsocial intelligence \u2014
p272
aVthat means anticipating what somebody else is thinking
p273
aVand feeling and planning \u2014
p274
aVand emotional reward.
p275
aVAnd these areas become much more engaged
p276
aVwhen we're interacting with a live partner.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, these richer brain signatures
p279
aVmight be why recruiters from Fortune 500 companies
p280
aVevaluating candidates
p281
aVthought that the candidates were smarter
p282
aVwhen they heard their voices
p283
aVcompared to when they just read their pitches in a text, for example,
p284
aVor an email or a letter.
p285
aVNow, our voices and body language convey a rich signal.
p286
aVIt shows that we're thinking, feeling,
p287
aVsentient human beings
p288
aVwho are much more than an algorithm.
p289
aVNow, this research by Nicholas Epley
p290
aVat the University of Chicago Business School
p291
aVis quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing.
p292
aVIf somebody hears your voice,
p293
aVthey think you're smarter.
p294
aVI mean, that's quite a simple thing.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow, to return to the beginning,
p297
aVwhy do women live longer than men?
p298
aVAnd one major reason is that women are more likely
p299
aVto prioritize and groom their face-to-face relationships
p300
aVover their lifespans.
p301
aVFresh evidence shows
p302
aVthat these in-person friendships
p303
aVcreate a biological force field against disease and decline.
p304
aVAnd it's not just true of humans
p305
aVbut their primate relations, our primate relations as well.
p306
aVAnthropologist Joan Silk's work shows that female baboons
p307
aVwho have a core of female friends
p308
aVshow lower levels of stress via their cortisol levels,
p309
aVthey live longer and they have more surviving offspring.
p310
aVAt least three stable relationships.
p311
aVThat was the magic number.
p312
aVThink about it.
p313
aVI hope you guys have three.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe power of such face-to-face contact
p316
aVis really why there are the lowest rates of dementia
p317
aVamong people who are socially engaged.
p318
aVIt's why women who have breast cancer
p319
aVare four times more likely to survive their disease than loners are.
p320
aVWhy men who've had a stroke who meet regularly to play poker
p321
aVor to have coffee
p322
aVor to play old-timer's hockey \u2014
p323
aVI'm Canadian, after all \u2014
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
Vare better protected by that social contact
p328
aVthan they are by medication.
p329
aVWhy men who've had a stroke who meet regularly \u2014
p330
aVthis is something very powerful they can do.
p331
aVThis face-to-face contact provides stunning benefits,
p332
aVyet now almost a quarter of the population says they have no one to talk to.
p333
aa(lp334
VWe can do something about this.
p335
aVLike Sardinian villagers,
p336
aVit's a biological imperative to know we belong,
p337
aVand not just the women among us.
p338
aVBuilding in-person interaction into our cities, into our workplaces,
p339
aVinto our agendas
p340
aVbolsters the immune system,
p341
aVsends feel-good hormones surging through the bloodstream and brain
p342
aVand helps us live longer.
p343
aVI call this building your village,
p344
aVand building it and sustaining it is a matter of life and death.
p345
aVThank you.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VHelen Walters: Susan, come back. I have a question for you.
p350
aVI'm wondering if there's a middle path.
p351
aVSo you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face,
p352
aVbut what about digital technology?
p353
aVWe've seen enormous improvements in digital technology
p354
aVlike FaceTime, things like that.
p355
aVDoes that work too?
p356
aVI mean, I see my nephew.
p357
aVHe plays Minecraft and he's yelling at his friends.
p358
aVIt seems like he's connecting pretty well.
p359
aVIs that useful? Is that helpful?
p360
aa(lp361
VSusan Pinker: Some of the data are just emerging.
p362
aVThe data are so fresh that the digital revolution happened
p363
aVand the health data trailed behind.
p364
aVSo we're just learning,
p365
aVbut I would say there are some improvements
p366
aVthat we could make in the technology.
p367
aVFor example, the camera on your laptop is at the top of the screen,
p368
aVso for example, when you're looking into the screen,
p369
aVyou're not actually making eye contact.
p370
aVSo something as simple as even just looking into the camera
p371
aVcan increase those neurotransmitters,
p372
aVor maybe changing the position of the camera.
p373
aVSo it's not identical, but I think we are getting closer with the technology.
p374
aa(lp375
