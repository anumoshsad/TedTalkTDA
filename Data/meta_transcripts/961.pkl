VJust a few minutes ago, I took this picture
p4
aVabout 10 blocks from here.
p5
aVThis is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.
p6
aVI took this picture because this turns out to be
p7
aVthe first coffeehouse to open
p8
aVin England in 1650.
p9
aVThat's its great claim to fame,
p10
aVand I wanted to show it to you,
p11
aVnot because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour
p12
aVof historic England,
p13
aVbut rather because
p14
aVthe English coffeehouse was crucial
p15
aVto the development and spread
p16
aVof one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,
p17
aVwhat we now call the Enlightenment.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd the coffeehouse played such a big role
p20
aVin the birth of the Enlightenment,
p21
aVin part, because of what people were drinking there.
p22
aVBecause, before the spread
p23
aVof coffee and tea through British culture,
p24
aVwhat people drank \u2014 both elite and mass folks drank \u2014
p25
aVday-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk
p26
aVwas alcohol.
p27
aVAlcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.
p28
aVYou would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,
p29
aVa little gin \u2014 particularly around 1650 \u2014
p30
aVand top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.
p31
aVThat was the healthy choice \u2014 right \u2014
p32
aVbecause the water wasn't safe to drink.
p33
aVAnd so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,
p34
aVyou had an entire population
p35
aVthat was effectively drunk all day.
p36
aVAnd you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life \u2014
p37
aVand I know this is true of some of you \u2014
p38
aVif you were drinking all day,
p39
aVand then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,
p40
aVyou would have better ideas.
p41
aVYou would be sharper and more alert.
p42
aVAnd so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened
p43
aVas England switched to tea and coffee.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important
p46
aVis the architecture of the space.
p47
aVIt was a space where people would get together
p48
aVfrom different backgrounds,
p49
aVdifferent fields of expertise, and share.
p50
aVIt was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.
p51
aVThis was their conjugal bed, in a sense \u2014
p52
aVideas would get together there.
p53
aVAnd an astonishing number of innovations from this period
p54
aVhave a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.
p55
aa(lp56
VI've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses
p57
aVfor the last five years,
p58
aVbecause I've been kind of on this quest
p59
aVto investigate this question
p60
aVof where good ideas come from.
p61
aVWhat are the environments
p62
aVthat lead to unusual levels of innovation,
p63
aVunusual levels of creativity?
p64
aVWhat's the kind of environmental \u2014
p65
aVwhat is the space of creativity?
p66
aVAnd what I've done is
p67
aVI've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;
p68
aVI've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,
p69
aVthat have been extraordinarily innovative;
p70
aVI've gone back to the history of the first cities;
p71
aVI've even gone to biological environments,
p72
aVlike coral reefs and rainforests,
p73
aVthat involve unusual levels of biological innovation;
p74
aVand what I've been looking for is shared patterns,
p75
aVkind of signature behavior that shows up
p76
aVagain and again in all of these environments.
p77
aVAre there recurring patterns that we can learn from,
p78
aVthat we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,
p79
aVor our own organizations,
p80
aVor our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?
p81
aVAnd I think I've found a few.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut what you have to do to make sense of this
p84
aVand to really understand these principles
p85
aVis you have to do away
p86
aVwith a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language
p87
aVsteers us towards
p88
aVcertain concepts of idea-creation.
p89
aVWe have this very rich vocabulary
p90
aVto describe moments of inspiration.
p91
aVWe have the kind of the flash of insight,
p92
aVthe stroke of insight,
p93
aVwe have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,
p94
aVwe have the lightbulb moments, right?
p95
aVAll of these concepts,
p96
aVas kind of rhetorically florid as they are,
p97
aVshare this basic assumption,
p98
aVwhich is that an idea is a single thing,
p99
aVit's something that happens often
p100
aVin a wonderful illuminating moment.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with
p103
aVis this idea that an idea is a network
p104
aVon the most elemental level.
p105
aVI mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.
p106
aVAn idea \u2014 a new idea \u2014 is a new network of neurons
p107
aVfiring in sync with each other inside your brain.
p108
aVIt's a new configuration that has never formed before.
p109
aVAnd the question is: how do you get your brain into environments
p110
aVwhere these new networks are going to be more likely to form?
p111
aVAnd it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world
p112
aVmimic a lot of the network patterns
p113
aVof the internal world of the human brain.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the metaphor I'd like the use
p116
aVI can take
p117
aVfrom a story of a great idea that's quite recent \u2014
p118
aVa lot more recent than the 1650s.
p119
aVA wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,
p120
aVwho has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.
p121
aVThey decided to tackle this really pressing problem
p122
aVof, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates
p123
aVin the developing world.
p124
aVOne of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,
p125
aVby getting modern neonatal incubators
p126
aVinto any context,
p127
aVif we can keep premature babies warm, basically \u2014 it's very simple \u2014
p128
aVwe can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.
p129
aVSo, the technology is there.
p130
aVThese are standard in all the industrialized worlds.
p131
aVThe problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,
p132
aVand you send it off
p133
aVto a mid-sized village in Africa,
p134
aVit will work great for a year or two years,
p135
aVand then something will go wrong and it will break,
p136
aVand it will remain broken forever,
p137
aVbecause you don't have a whole system of spare parts,
p138
aVand you don't have the on-the-ground expertise
p139
aVto fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.
p140
aVAnd so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money
p141
aVgetting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,
p142
aVand then it ends up being useless.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo what Prestero and his team decided to do
p145
aVis to look around and see: what are the abundant resources
p146
aVin these developing world contexts?
p147
aVAnd what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs,
p148
aVthey don't have a lot of microwaves,
p149
aVbut they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.
p150
aVThere's a Toyota Forerunner
p151
aVon the street in all these places.
p152
aVThey seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.
p153
aVSo they started to think,
p154
aV"Could we build a neonatal incubator
p155
aVthat's built entirely out of automobile parts?"
p156
aVAnd this is what they ended up coming with.
p157
aVIt's called a "neonurture device."
p158
aVFrom the outside, it looks like a normal little thing
p159
aVyou'd find in a modern, Western hospital.
p160
aVIn the inside, it's all car parts.
p161
aVIt's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,
p162
aVit's got door chimes for alarm \u2014
p163
aVit runs off a car battery.
p164
aVAnd so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota
p165
aVand the ability to fix a headlight,
p166
aVand you can repair this thing.
p167
aVNow, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact,
p168
aVthis is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.
p169
aVWe like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,
p170
aVare like that $40,000, brand new incubator,
p171
aVstate-of-the-art technology,
p172
aVbut more often than not, they're cobbled together
p173
aVfrom whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe take ideas from other people,
p176
aVfrom people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,
p177
aVand we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.
p178
aVThat's really where innovation happens.
p179
aVAnd that means that we have to change some of our models
p180
aVof what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.
p181
aVI mean, this is one vision of it.
p182
aVAnother is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.
p183
aVThis is a statue from Oxford.
p184
aVYou know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,
p185
aVand the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.
p186
aVIn fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation
p187
aVtend to look like this, right.
p188
aVThis is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,
p189
aVbut this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.
p190
aVThis is the kind of chaotic environment
p191
aVwhere ideas were likely to come together,
p192
aVwhere people were likely to have
p193
aVnew, interesting, unpredictable collisions \u2014 people from different backgrounds.
p194
aVSo, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,
p195
aVwe have to build spaces that \u2014 strangely enough \u2014 look a little bit more like this.
p196
aVThis is what your office should look like,
p197
aVis part of my message here.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd one of the problems with this is that
p200
aVpeople are actually \u2014 when you research this field \u2014
p201
aVpeople are notoriously unreliable,
p202
aVwhen they actually kind of self-report
p203
aVon where they have their own good ideas,
p204
aVor their history of their best ideas.
p205
aVAnd a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar
p206
aVdecided to go around
p207
aVand basically do the Big Brother approach
p208
aVto figuring out where good ideas come from.
p209
aVHe went to a bunch of science labs around the world
p210
aVand videotaped everyone
p211
aVas they were doing every little bit of their job.
p212
aVSo when they were sitting in front of the microscope,
p213
aVwhen they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.
p214
aVAnd he recorded all of these conversations
p215
aVand tried to figure out where the most important ideas,
p216
aVwhere they happened.
p217
aVAnd when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,
p218
aVwe have this image \u2014 you know, they're pouring over the microscope,
p219
aVand they see something in the tissue sample.
p220
aVAnd "oh, eureka," they've got the idea.
p221
aa(lp222
VWhat happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape
p223
aVis that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas
p224
aVdid not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.
p225
aVThey happened at the conference table
p226
aVat the weekly lab meeting,
p227
aVwhen everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,
p228
aVoftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,
p229
aVthe error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.
p230
aVAnd something about that environment \u2014
p231
aVand I've started calling it the "liquid network,"
p232
aVwhere you have lots of different ideas that are together,
p233
aVdifferent backgrounds, different interests,
p234
aVjostling with each other, bouncing off each other \u2014
p235
aVthat environment is, in fact,
p236
aVthe environment that leads to innovation.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe other problem that people have
p239
aVis they like to condense their stories of innovation down
p240
aVto kind of shorter time frames.
p241
aVSo they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.
p242
aVThey want to say, "There I was, I was standing there
p243
aVand I had it all suddenly clear in my head."
p244
aVBut in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,
p245
aVit turns out that a lot of important ideas
p246
aVhave very long incubation periods \u2014
p247
aVI call this the "slow hunch."
p248
aVWe've heard a lot recently
p249
aVabout hunch and instinct
p250
aVand blink-like sudden moments of clarity,
p251
aVbut in fact, a lot of great ideas
p252
aVlinger on, sometimes for decades,
p253
aVin the back of people's minds.
p254
aVThey have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,
p255
aVbut they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.
p256
aVThey spend all this time working on certain problems,
p257
aVbut there's another thing lingering there
p258
aVthat they're interested in, but they can't quite solve.
p259
aa(lp260
VDarwin is a great example of this.
p261
aVDarwin himself, in his autobiography,
p262
aVtells the story of coming up with the idea
p263
aVfor natural selection
p264
aVas a classic "eureka!" moment.
p265
aVHe's in his study,
p266
aVit's October of 1838,
p267
aVand he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.
p268
aVAnd all of a sudden,
p269
aVthe basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head
p270
aVand he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."
p271
aVThat's in his autobiography.
p272
aVAbout a decade or two ago,
p273
aVa wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back
p274
aVand looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.
p275
aVAnd Darwin kept these copious notebooks
p276
aVwhere he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.
p277
aVAnd what Gruber found was
p278
aVthat Darwin had the full theory of natural selection
p279
aVfor months and months and months
p280
aVbefore he had his alleged epiphany,
p281
aVreading Malthus in October of 1838.
p282
aVThere are passages where you can read it,
p283
aVand you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,
p284
aVfrom the period before he has this epiphany.
p285
aVAnd so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,
p286
aVhad the idea, he had the concept,
p287
aVbut was unable of fully thinking it yet.
p288
aVAnd that is actually how great ideas often happen;
p289
aVthey fade into view over long periods of time.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow the challenge for all of us is:
p292
aVhow do you create environments
p293
aVthat allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?
p294
aVIt's hard to go to your boss and say,
p295
aV"I have an excellent idea for our organization.
p296
aVIt will be useful in 2020.
p297
aVCould you just give me some time to do that?"
p298
aVNow a couple of companies \u2014 like Google \u2014
p299
aVthey have innovation time off, 20 percent time,
p300
aVwhere, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.
p301
aVBut that's a key thing.
p302
aVAnd the other thing is to allow those hunches
p303
aVto connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.
p304
aVYou have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,
p305
aVand if you're in the right environment,
p306
aVthey turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.
p307
aVSo, in a sense,
p308
aVwe often talk about the value
p309
aVof protecting intellectual property,
p310
aVyou know, building barricades,
p311
aVhaving secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have,
p312
aVso that those ideas will remain valuable,
p313
aVand people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,
p314
aVand the culture will be more innovative.
p315
aVBut I think there's a case to be made
p316
aVthat we should spend at least as much time, if not more,
p317
aVvaluing the premise of connecting ideas
p318
aVand not just protecting them.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd I'll leave you with this story,
p321
aVwhich I think captures a lot of these values,
p322
aVand it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation
p323
aVand how it happens in unlikely ways.
p324
aVIt's October of 1957,
p325
aVand Sputnik has just launched,
p326
aVand we're in Laurel Maryland,
p327
aVat the applied physics lab
p328
aVassociated with Johns Hopkins University.
p329
aVAnd it's Monday morning,
p330
aVand the news has just broken about this satellite
p331
aVthat's now orbiting the planet.
p332
aVAnd of course, this is nerd heaven, right?
p333
aVThere are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,
p334
aV"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened."
p335
aVAnd two of them,
p336
aVtwo 20-something researchers at the APL
p337
aVare there at the cafeteria table
p338
aVhaving an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.
p339
aVAnd these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.
p340
aVAnd they start talking, and one of them says,
p341
aV"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?
p342
aVThere's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space
p343
aVthat's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.
p344
aVWe could probably hear it, if we tune in."
p345
aVAnd so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,
p346
aVand everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.
p347
aVThat's an interesting idea."
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert
p350
aVin microwave reception,
p351
aVand he's got a little antennae set up
p352
aVwith an amplifier in his office.
p353
aVAnd so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,
p354
aVand they start kind of noodling around \u2014 hacking, as we might call it now.
p355
aVAnd after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,
p356
aVbecause the Soviets made Sputnik
p357
aVvery easy to track.
p358
aVIt was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,
p359
aVbecause they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
p360
aVSo they made it really easy to find it.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,
p363
aVand people start kind of coming into the office and saying,
p364
aV"Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great."
p365
aVAnd before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.
p366
aVWe may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.
p367
aVWe should record it."
p368
aVAnd so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder
p369
aVand they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.
p370
aVAnd they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps
p371
aVfor each little bleep that they record.
p372
aVAnd they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing
p373
aVsmall little frequency variations here.
p374
aVWe could probably calculate the speed
p375
aVthat the satellite is traveling,
p376
aVif we do a little basic math here
p377
aVusing the Doppler effect."
p378
aVAnd then they played around with it a little bit more,
p379
aVand they talked to a couple of their colleagues
p380
aVwho had other kind of specialties.
p381
aVAnd they said, "Jeez, you know,
p382
aVwe think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect
p383
aVto figure out the points at which
p384
aVthe satellite is closest to our antennae
p385
aVand the points at which it's farthest away.
p386
aVThat's pretty cool."
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd eventually, they get permission \u2014
p389
aVthis is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.
p390
aVThey get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer
p391
aVthat takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.
p392
aVThey run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,
p393
aVturns out they have mapped the exact trajectory
p394
aVof this satellite around the Earth,
p395
aVjust from listening to this one little signal,
p396
aVgoing off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do
p397
aVover lunch one morning.
p398
aa(lp399
VA couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,
p400
aVpulls them into the room and says,
p401
aV"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something
p402
aVabout that project you were working on.
p403
aVYou've figured out an unknown location
p404
aVof a satellite orbiting the planet
p405
aVfrom a known location on the ground.
p406
aVCould you go the other way?
p407
aVCould you figure out an unknown location on the ground,
p408
aVif you knew the location of the satellite?"
p409
aVAnd they thought about it and they said,
p410
aV"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here."
p411
aVSo they went back, and they thought about it.
p412
aVAnd they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."
p413
aVAnd he said, "Oh, that's great.
p414
aVBecause see, I have these new nuclear submarines
p415
aVthat I'm building.
p416
aVAnd it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile
p417
aVso that it will land right on top of Moscow,
p418
aVif you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
p419
aVSo we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites
p420
aVand use it to track our submarines
p421
aVand figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.
p422
aVCould you work on that problem?"
p423
aa(lp424
VAnd that's how GPS was born.
