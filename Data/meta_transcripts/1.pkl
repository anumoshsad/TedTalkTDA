VThank you so much, Chris.
p4
aVAnd it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity
p5
aVto come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
p6
aVI have been blown away by this conference,
p7
aVand I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments
p8
aVabout what I had to say the other night.
p9
aVAnd I say that sincerely,
p10
aVpartly because (Mock sob)
p11
aVI need that.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VPut yourselves in my position.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI flew on Air Force Two for eight years.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VNow I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
V(Applause)
p28
aa(lp29
VI'll tell you one quick story
p30
aVto illustrate what that's been like for me.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VIt's a true story \u2014 every bit of this is true.
p35
aa(lp36
VSoon after Tipper and I left the \u2014 (Mock sob) White House \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
Vwe were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have
p41
aV50 miles east of Nashville.
p42
aVDriving ourselves.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VI know it sounds like a little thing to you, but \u2014
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VI looked in the rear-view mirror
p51
aVand all of a sudden it just hit me.
p52
aVThere was no motorcade back there.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VYou've heard of phantom limb pain?
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VThis was a rented Ford Taurus.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VIt was dinnertime,
p65
aVand we started looking for a place to eat.
p66
aVWe were on I-40.
p67
aVWe got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.
p68
aVWe got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
p69
aVLow-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.
p70
aVWe went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,
p71
aVmade a big commotion over Tipper.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VShe took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us,
p76
aVand she lowered her voice so much,
p77
aVI had to really strain to hear what she was saying.
p78
aVAnd she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore
p79
aVand his wife, Tipper."
p80
aVAnd the man said,
p81
aV"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VThere's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VThe very next day, continuing the totally true story,
p92
aVI got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,
p93
aVin the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.
p94
aVAnd I began the speech by telling them the story
p95
aVof what had just happened the day before in Nashville.
p96
aVAnd I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:
p97
aVTipper and I were driving ourselves,
p98
aVShoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain,
p99
aVwhat the man said \u2014 they laughed.
p100
aVI gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
p101
aVI fell asleep on the plane
p102
aVuntil, during the middle of the night, we landed
p103
aVon the Azores Islands for refueling.
p104
aVI woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,
p105
aVand I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.
p106
aVAnd he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,
p107
aV"Call Washington! Call Washington!"
p108
aVAnd I thought to myself, in the middle of the night,
p109
aVin the middle of the Atlantic,
p110
aVwhat in the world could be wrong in Washington?
p111
aVThen I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VBut what it turned out to be,
p116
aVwas that my staff was extremely upset
p117
aVbecause one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story
p118
aVabout my speech,
p119
aVand it had already been printed in cities
p120
aVall across the United States of America.
p121
aVIt was printed in Monterey, I checked.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd the story began,
p126
aV"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:
p127
aV'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" \u2014
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
V"'named Shoney's,
p132
aVand we are running it ourselves.'"
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VBefore I could get back to U.S. soil,
p137
aVDavid Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on \u2014
p138
aVone of them had me in a big white chef's hat,
p139
aVTipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!"
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThree days later,
p144
aVI got a nice, long, handwritten letter
p145
aVfrom my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,
p146
aV"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VWe like to celebrate each other's successes in life.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VI was going to talk about information ecology.
p155
aVBut I was thinking that,
p156
aVsince I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,
p157
aVthat maybe I could talk about that another time.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VChris Anderson: It's a deal!
p162
aa(lp163
V(Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
VAl Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said
p166
aVyou would like me to elaborate on:
p167
aVWhat can you do about the climate crisis?
p168
aVI want to start with a couple of \u2014
p169
aVI'm going to show some new images,
p170
aVand I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.
p171
aVNow, the slide show.
p172
aVI update the slide show every time I give it.
p173
aVI add new images,
p174
aVbecause I learn more about it every time I give it.
p175
aVIt's like beach-combing, you know?
p176
aVEvery time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
p177
aVJust in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.
p178
aVThis is just for the United States of America.
p179
aVHistorical average for Januarys is 31 degrees;
p180
aVlast month was 39.5 degrees.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment \u2014
p183
aVI'm kidding.
p184
aVBut these are the recapitulation slides,
p185
aVand then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.
p186
aVBut I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
p187
aVFirst of all, this is where we're projected to go
p188
aVwith the U.S. contribution to global warming,
p189
aVunder business as usual.
p190
aVEfficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy
p191
aVis the low-hanging fruit.
p192
aVEfficiency and conservation \u2014 it's not a cost; it's a profit.
p193
aVThe sign is wrong.
p194
aVIt's not negative; it's positive.
p195
aVThese are investments that pay for themselves.
p196
aVBut they are also very effective in deflecting our path.
p197
aa(lp198
VCars and trucks \u2014 I talked about that in the slideshow,
p199
aVbut I want you to put it in perspective.
p200
aVIt's an easy, visible target of concern \u2014
p201
aVand it should be \u2014
p202
aVbut there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings
p203
aVthan from cars and trucks.
p204
aVCars and trucks are very significant,
p205
aVand we have the lowest standards in the world.
p206
aVAnd so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.
p207
aVOther transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
p208
aVRenewables at the current levels of technological efficiency
p209
aVcan make this much difference.
p210
aVAnd with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here \u2014
p211
aVthere are a lot of people directly involved in this \u2014
p212
aVthis wedge is going to grow much more rapidly
p213
aVthan the current projection shows it.
p214
aVCarbon Capture and Sequestration \u2014 that's what CCS stands for \u2014
p215
aVis likely to become the killer app that will enable us
p216
aVto continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.
p217
aVNot quite there yet.
p218
aVOK. Now, what can you do?
p219
aa(lp220
VReduce emissions in your home.
p221
aVMost of these expenditures are also profitable.
p222
aVInsulation, better design.
p223
aVBuy green electricity where you can.
p224
aVI mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid.
p225
aVUse light rail.
p226
aVFigure out some of the other options that are much better.
p227
aVIt's important.
p228
aa(lp229
VBe a green consumer.
p230
aVYou have choices with everything you buy,
p231
aVbetween things that have a harsh effect,
p232
aVor a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.
p233
aVConsider this:
p234
aVMake a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.
p235
aVThose of you who are good at branding,
p236
aVI'd love to get your advice and help
p237
aVon how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
p238
aVIt is easier than you think.
p239
aVIt really is.
p240
aVA lot of us in here have made that decision,
p241
aVand it is really pretty easy.
p242
aVIt means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions
p243
aVwith the full range of choices that you make,
p244
aVand then purchase or acquire offsets
p245
aVfor the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
p246
aVAnd what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
p247
aa(lp248
VThere is a carbon calculator.
p249
aVParticipant Productions convened \u2014
p250
aVwith my active involvement \u2014
p251
aVthe leading software writers in the world,
p252
aVon this arcane science of carbon calculation,
p253
aVto construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
p254
aVYou can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,
p255
aVand then you will be given options to reduce.
p256
aVAnd by the time the movie comes out in May,
p257
aVthis will be updated to 2.0,
p258
aVand we will have click-through purchases of offsets.
p259
aa(lp260
VNext, consider making your business carbon-neutral.
p261
aVAgain, some of us have done that,
p262
aVand it's not as hard as you think.
p263
aVIntegrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,
p264
aVwhether you are from the technology,
p265
aVor entertainment, or design and architecture community.
p266
aVInvest sustainably.
p267
aVMajora mentioned this.
p268
aVListen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate
p269
aVon the basis of their annual performance,
p270
aVdon't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.
p271
aVOver time, people do what you pay them to do.
p272
aVAnd if they judge how much they're going to get paid
p273
aVon your capital that they've invested,
p274
aVbased on the short-term returns,
p275
aVyou're going to get short-term decisions.
p276
aVA lot more to be said about that.
p277
aa(lp278
VBecome a catalyst of change.
p279
aVTeach others, learn about it, talk about it.
p280
aVThe movie is a movie version of the slideshow
p281
aVI gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
p282
aVAnd it comes out in May.
p283
aVMany of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
p284
aVConsider sending somebody to Nashville.
p285
aVPick well.
p286
aVAnd I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow \u2014
p287
aVre-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced
p288
aVwith a generic approach,
p289
aVand it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
p290
aVAnd it's how they link together.
p291
aVAnd so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer
p292
aVfor a group of people that are nominated by different folks
p293
aVto come and then give it en masse,
p294
aVin communities all across the country,
p295
aVand we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week,
p296
aVto keep it right on the cutting edge.
p297
aVWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,
p298
aVposted with tools and limited-use copyrights,
p299
aVso that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VWhere did anybody get the idea
p304
aVthat you ought to stay arm's length from politics?
p305
aVIt doesn't mean that if you're a Republican,
p306
aVthat I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.
p307
aVWe need Republicans as well.
p308
aVThis used to be a bipartisan issue,
p309
aVand I know that in this group it really is.
p310
aVBecome politically active.
p311
aVMake our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
p312
aVSupport the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014
p313
aVglobal warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.
p314
aVHere's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,
p315
aVit's not a closed system.
p316
aVOnce it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,
p317
aVthen everybody who's on a board of directors \u2014
p318
aVhow many people here serve on the board of directors
p319
aVof a corporation?
p320
aVOnce it's a closed system,
p321
aVyou will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO
p322
aVto get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions
p323
aVthat can be avoided.
p324
aVThe market will work to solve this problem \u2014
p325
aVif we can accomplish this.
p326
aVHelp with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
p327
aVWe have to change the minds of the American people.
p328
aVBecause presently, the politicians do not have permission
p329
aVto do what needs to be done.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes
p332
aVmediating between wealth and power the way it once did.
p333
aVIt's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.
p334
aVWe have to buy a lot of those ads.
p335
aVLet's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.
p336
aVI like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"
p337
aVbut again, those of you who are good at branding,
p338
aVI need your help on this.
p339
aVSomebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,
p340
aVis whether the combination of an opposable thumb
p341
aVand a neocortex is a viable combination.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VThat's really true.
p346
aa(lp347
VI said the other night, and I'll repeat now:
p348
aVthis is not a political issue.
p349
aVAgain, the Republicans here \u2014 this shouldn't be partisan.
p350
aVYou have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
p351
aVThis is an opportunity.
p352
aVNot just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,
p353
aVto bring more coherence to them.
p354
aVWe are one.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you very much, I appreciate it.
