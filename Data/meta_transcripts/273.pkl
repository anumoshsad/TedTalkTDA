VYou know, culture was born of the imagination,
p4
aVand the imagination \u2014 the imagination as we know it \u2014
p5
aVcame into being when our species descended
p6
aVfrom our progenitor, Homo erectus,
p7
aVand, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it
p8
aVto every corner of the habitable world.
p9
aVFor a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,
p10
aVwho clearly had some spark of awareness,
p11
aVbut \u2014 whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,
p12
aVor the development of language,
p13
aVor some other evolutionary catalyst \u2014
p14
aVwe quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.
p15
aVBy the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,
p16
aV27,000 years ago,
p17
aVour direct ancestors had already,
p18
aVand for 5,000 years,
p19
aVbeen crawling into the belly of the earth,
p20
aVwhere in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,
p21
aVthey had brought into being
p22
aVthe great art of the Upper Paleolithic.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I spent two months in the caves of southwest France
p25
aVwith the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."
p26
aVAnd you could look at this art and you could, of course,
p27
aVsee the complex social organization
p28
aVof the people who brought it into being.
p29
aVBut more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,
p30
aVsomething far more sophisticated than hunting magic.
p31
aVAnd the way Clayton put it was this way.
p32
aVHe said, "You know, clearly at some point,
p33
aVwe were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."
p34
aVAnd he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,
p35
aVthrough ritual, to rekindle a connection
p36
aVthat had been irrevocably lost.
p37
aVSo, he saw this art not as
p38
aVhunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.
p39
aVAnd viewed in that light,
p40
aVit takes on a whole other resonance.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art
p43
aVis that as an aesthetic expression,
p44
aVit lasted for almost 20,000 years.
p45
aVIf these were postcards of nostalgia,
p46
aVours was a very long farewell indeed.
p47
aVAnd it was also the beginning of our discontent,
p48
aVbecause if you wanted to distill all of our experience
p49
aVsince the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:
p50
aVhow and why.
p51
aVAnd these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.
p52
aVNow, all people share the same
p53
aVraw, adaptive imperatives.
p54
aVWe all have children.
p55
aVWe all have to deal with the mystery of death,
p56
aVthe world that waits beyond death,
p57
aVthe elders who fall away into their elderly years.
p58
aVAll of this is part of our common experience,
p59
aVand this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,
p60
aVbiologists have finally proven it to be true,
p61
aVsomething that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.
p62
aVAnd that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.
p63
aVWe are all cut from the same genetic cloth.
p64
aVAll of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people
p65
aVwho left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut the corollary of that is that,
p68
aVif we all are brothers and sisters
p69
aVand share the same genetic material,
p70
aVall human populations share the same raw human genius,
p71
aVthe same intellectual acuity.
p72
aVAnd so whether that genius is placed
p73
aVinto \u2014 technological wizardry
p74
aVhas been the great achievement of the West \u2014
p75
aVor by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads
p76
aVof memory inherent in a myth,
p77
aVis simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.
p78
aVThere is no progression of affairs
p79
aVin human experience.
p80
aVThere is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid
p81
aVthat conveniently places Victorian England at the apex
p82
aVand descends down the flanks
p83
aVto the so-called primitives of the world.
p84
aVAll peoples are simply cultural options,
p85
aVdifferent visions of life itself.
p86
aVBut what do I mean by different visions of life
p87
aVmaking for completely different
p88
aVpossibilities for existence?
p89
aa(lp90
VWell, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere
p91
aVever brought into being by the imagination,
p92
aVthat of Polynesia.
p93
aV10,000 square kilometers,
p94
aVtens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.
p95
aVI recently sailed on the Hokulea,
p96
aVnamed after the sacred star of Hawaii,
p97
aVthroughout the South Pacific to make a film
p98
aVabout the navigators.
p99
aVThese are men and women who, even today, can name
p100
aV250 stars in the night sky.
p101
aVThese are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls
p102
aVof islands beyond the visible horizon,
p103
aVsimply by watching the reverberation of waves
p104
aVacross the hull of their vessel, knowing full well
p105
aVthat every island group in the Pacific
p106
aVhas its unique refractive pattern
p107
aVthat can be read with the same perspicacity
p108
aVwith which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.
p109
aVThese are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,
p110
aVcan distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells
p111
aVmoving through the canoe at any one point in time,
p112
aVdistinguishing local wave disturbances
p113
aVfrom the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,
p114
aVthat can be followed with the same ease
p115
aVthat a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.
p116
aVIndeed, if you took all of the genius
p117
aVthat allowed us to put a man on the moon
p118
aVand applied it to an understanding of the ocean,
p119
aVwhat you would get is Polynesia.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd if we slip from the realm of the sea
p122
aVinto the realm of the spirit of the imagination,
p123
aVyou enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.
p124
aVAnd I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."
p125
aVWhy did we use that word, science?
p126
aVWhat is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?
p127
aVWhat is Buddhism but 2,500 years
p128
aVof empirical observation
p129
aVas to the nature of mind?
p130
aVI travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,
p131
aVand you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us
p132
aVhere once at TED,
p133
aV"Western science is a major response to minor needs."
p134
aVWe spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100
p135
aVwithout losing our teeth.
p136
aVThe Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.
p137
aa(lp138
VOur billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.
p139
aVTheir billboards are manuals,
p140
aVprayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.
p141
aVAnd with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage
p142
aVto a curious destination,
p143
aVaccompanied by a great doctor.
p144
aVAnd the destination was a single room in a nunnery,
p145
aVwhere a woman had gone into lifelong retreat
p146
aV55 years before.
p147
aVAnd en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,
p148
aVand he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,
p149
aVthe essence of the Buddhist path.
p150
aVAll life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.
p151
aVIt means things happen.
p152
aVThe cause of suffering is ignorance.
p153
aVBy that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;
p154
aVhe meant clinging to the illusion
p155
aVthat life is static and predictable.
p156
aVThe third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.
p157
aVAnd the fourth and most important, of course,
p158
aVwas the delineation of a contemplative practice
p159
aVthat not only had the possibility
p160
aVof a transformation of the human heart,
p161
aVbut had 2,500 years of empirical evidence
p162
aVthat such a transformation was a certainty.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman
p165
aVwho had not been out of that room in 55 years,
p166
aVyou did not see a mad woman.
p167
aVYou saw a woman who was more clear
p168
aVthan a pool of water in a mountain stream.
p169
aVAnd of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.
p170
aVThey said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe
p171
aVyou went to the moon, but you did.
p172
aVYou may not believe that we achieve enlightenment
p173
aVin one lifetime, but we do.
p174
aVAnd if we move from the realm of the spirit
p175
aVto the realm of the physical,
p176
aVto the sacred geography of Peru \u2014
p177
aVI've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people
p178
aVthat literally believe that the Earth is alive,
p179
aVresponsive to all of their aspirations,
p180
aVall of their needs.
p181
aVAnd, of course, the human population
p182
aVhas its own reciprocal obligations.
p183
aa(lp184
VI spent 30 years living amongst
p185
aVthe people of Chinchero
p186
aVand I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.
p187
aVOnce each year, the fastest young boy
p188
aVin each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.
p189
aVAnd for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister
p190
aVand he becomes a transvestite,
p191
aVa waylaka. And for that day,
p192
aVhe leads all able-bodied men on a run,
p193
aVbut it's not your ordinary run.
p194
aVYou start off at 11,500 feet.
p195
aVYou run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.
p196
aVYou run up to 15,000 feet,
p197
aVdescend 3,000 feet.
p198
aVClimb again over the course of 24 hours.
p199
aVAnd of course, the waylakama spin,
p200
aVthe trajectory of the route,
p201
aVis marked by holy mounds of Earth,
p202
aVwhere coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,
p203
aVthe vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.
p204
aVAnd the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,
p205
aVbut through exhaustion, through sacrifice,
p206
aVyou emerge as a community that has once again
p207
aVreaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.
p208
aVAnd at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,
p209
aVonly one to finish it.
p210
aVI only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day
p211
aVthan anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut these localized rituals become pan-Andean,
p214
aVand these fantastic festivals,
p215
aVlike that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs
p216
aVwhen the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.
p217
aVIt's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:
p218
aV60,000 Indians on pilgrimage
p219
aVto the end of a dirt road
p220
aVthat leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,
p221
aVwhich is dominated by three tongues
p222
aVof the great glacier.
p223
aVThe metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,
p224
aVin this wonderful fusion of Christian
p225
aVand pre-Columbian ideas.
p226
aVYou place the cross into the ice,
p227
aVin the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,
p228
aVor sacred mountains of the Inca.
p229
aVAnd then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, these ideas and these events
p232
aVallow us even to deconstruct iconic places
p233
aVthat many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.
p234
aVMachu Picchu was never a lost city.
p235
aVOn the contrary, it was completely linked in
p236
aVto the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads
p237
aVthe Inca made in less than a century.
p238
aVBut more importantly, it was linked in
p239
aVto the Andean notions of sacred geography.
p240
aVThe intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,
p241
aVis actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light
p242
aVthat falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,
p243
aVwhich is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.
p244
aVIf you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.
p245
aVClimb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.
p246
aVTake a direct north-south bearing,
p247
aVyou find to your astonishment
p248
aVthat it bisects the intiwatana stone,
p249
aVgoes to the skyline,
p250
aVhits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains
p251
aVof the Incan empire.
p252
aVAnd then beyond Salcantay, of course,
p253
aVwhen the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,
p254
aVdirectly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.
p255
aVBut what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?
p256
aVThe sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,
p257
aVwhich is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,
p258
aVbut it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked
p259
aVat the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.
p260
aVAnd where does the river rise?
p261
aVRight on the slopes of the Koariti.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo, 500 years after Columbus,
p264
aVthese ancient rhythms of landscape
p265
aVare played out in ritual.
p266
aVNow, when I was here at the first TED,
p267
aVI showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,
p268
aVthe descendants, survivors of El Dorado.
p269
aVThese, of course, are the descendants
p270
aVof the ancient Tairona civilization.
p271
aVIf those of you who are here remember that I mentioned
p272
aVthat they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,
p273
aVbut the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.
p274
aVTaken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
p275
aVfor 18 years \u2014 two nine-year periods deliberately chosen
p276
aVto evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.
p277
aVAll that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
p278
aVas they are taught the values of their society.
p279
aVValues that maintain the proposition that their prayers,
p280
aVand their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.
p281
aVNow, the measure of a society is not only what it does,
p282
aVbut the quality of its aspirations.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd I always wanted to go back into these mountains,
p285
aVto see if this could possibly be true,
p286
aVas indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,
p287
aVReichel-Dolmatoff.
p288
aVSo, literally two weeks ago,
p289
aVI returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers
p290
aVon what was clearly the most
p291
aVextraordinary trip of my life.
p292
aVThese really are a people who live and breathe
p293
aVthe realm of the sacred,
p294
aVa baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.
p295
aVThey consume more coca leaves than any human population,
p296
aVhalf a pound per man, per day.
p297
aVThe gourd you see here is \u2014
p298
aVeverything in their lives is symbolic.
p299
aVTheir central metaphor is a loom.
p300
aVThey say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."
p301
aVThey refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient
p302
aVas "threads."
p303
aVWhen they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,
p304
aVspinning their thoughts into the heavens.
p305
aa(lp306
VYou can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.
p307
aVThe gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.
p308
aVYou put the stick in the powder
p309
aVto take the sacred ashes \u2014 well, they're not ashes,
p310
aVthey're burnt limestone \u2014
p311
aVto empower the coca leaf, to change
p312
aVthe pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption
p313
aVof cocaine hydrochloride.
p314
aVBut if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,
p315
aVbecause every stroke of that stick
p316
aVthat has built up that calcium,
p317
aVthe measure of a man's life,
p318
aVhas a thought behind it.
p319
aVFields are planted in such an extraordinary way,
p320
aVthat the one side of the field
p321
aVis planted like that by the women.
p322
aVThe other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,
p323
aVyou turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.
p324
aVAnd they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,
p325
aVthe greatest goldsmiths of South America,
p326
aVwho in the wake of the conquest,
p327
aVretreated into this isolated volcanic massif
p328
aVthat soars to 20,000 feet
p329
aVabove the Caribbean coastal plain.
p330
aa(lp331
VThere are four societies:
p332
aVthe Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.
p333
aVI traveled with the Arhuacos,
p334
aVand the wonderful thing about this story
p335
aVwas that this man, Danilo Villafane \u2014
p336
aVif we just jump back here for a second.
p337
aVWhen I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,
p338
aVI couldn't help but say, "You know,
p339
aVyou look a lot like an old friend of mine."
p340
aVWell, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,
p341
aVfrom 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.
p342
aVAnd I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,
p343
aVbut when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,
p344
aVup and down the mountains."
p345
aVAnd because of that, Danilo invited us
p346
aVto go to the very heart of the world,
p347
aVa place where no journalist had ever been permitted.
p348
aVNot simply to the flanks of the mountains,
p349
aVbut to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd this man sitting cross-legged
p352
aVis now a grown-up Eugenio,
p353
aVa man who I've known since 1974.
p354
aVAnd this is one of those initiates.
p355
aVNo, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,
p356
aVbut they are kept within the confines
p357
aVof the ceremonial men's circle
p358
aVfor 18 years.
p359
aVThis little boy will never step outside
p360
aVof the sacred fields
p361
aVthat surround the men's hut for all that time,
p362
aVuntil he begins his journey of initiation.
p363
aVFor that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
p364
aVas he is taught the values of society,
p365
aVincluding this notion that their prayers alone
p366
aVmaintain the cosmic balance.
p367
aVBefore we could begin our journey,
p368
aVwe had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.
p369
aVAnd it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.
p370
aVAnd you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet \u2014
p371
aVthere must be nothing between the feet
p372
aVand the Earth for a mamo.
p373
aVAnd this is actually the place where the Great Mother
p374
aVsent the spindle into the world
p375
aVthat elevated the mountains and created the homeland
p376
aVthat they call the heart of the world.
p377
aa(lp378
VWe traveled high into the paramo,
p379
aVand as we crested the hills,
p380
aVwe realized that the men were interpreting
p381
aVevery single bump on the landscape
p382
aVin terms of their own intense religiosity.
p383
aVAnd then of course, as we reached our final destination,
p384
aVa place called Mamancana,
p385
aVwe were in for a surprise,
p386
aVbecause the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.
p387
aVAnd so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,
p388
aVhidden away until the darkness.
p389
aVAnd then, abandoning all our gear,
p390
aVwe were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,
p391
aVin a quite dramatic scene.
p392
aVIt's going to look like a John Ford Western.
p393
aVAnd we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.
p394
aVIt will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating
p395
aVis that the minute there was a sense of dangers,
p396
aVthe mamos went into a circle of divination.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd of course, this is a photograph
p399
aVliterally taken the night we were in hiding,
p400
aVas they divine their route
p401
aVto take us out of the mountains.
p402
aVWe were able to, because we had trained
p403
aVpeople in filmmaking,
p404
aVcontinue with our work,
p405
aVand send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers
p406
aVto the final sacred lakes
p407
aVto get the last shots for the film,
p408
aVand we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,
p409
aVtaking the elements from the highlands to the sea.
p410
aVAnd here you see how their sacred landscape
p411
aVhas been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,
p412
aVand yet, still they pray.
p413
aVAnd it's an amazing thing to think
p414
aVthat this close to Miami,
p415
aVtwo hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people
p416
aVpraying every day for your well-being.
p417
aVThey call themselves the Elder Brothers.
p418
aVThey dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world
p419
aVas the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand
p420
aVwhy it is that we do what we do to the Earth.
p421
aa(lp422
VNow, if we slip to another end of the world,
p423
aVI was up in the high Arctic
p424
aVto tell a story about global warming,
p425
aVinspired in part by
p426
aVthe former Vice President's wonderful book.
p427
aVAnd what struck me so extraordinary
p428
aVwas to be again with the Inuit \u2014
p429
aVa people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.
p430
aVA people who
p431
aVfind a way, with their imagination,
p432
aVto carve life out of that very frozen.
p433
aVA people for whom blood on ice
p434
aVis not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.
p435
aVAnd yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,
p436
aVyou find to your astonishment
p437

VNow, I want to stress that none of these peoples
p445
aVthat I've been quickly talking about here
p446
aVare disappearing worlds.
p447
aVThese are not dying peoples.
p448
aVOn the contrary, you know,
p449
aVif you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,
p450
aVyou discover that the world is not flat.
p451
aVThe world remains a rich tapestry.
p452
aVIt remains a rich topography of the spirit.
p453
aVThese myriad voices of humanity
p454
aVare not failed attempts at being new,
p455
aVfailed attempts at being modern.
p456
aVThey're unique facets of the human imagination.
p457
aVThey're unique answers to a fundamental question:
p458
aVwhat does it mean to be human and alive?
p459
aVAnd when asked that question, they respond
p460
aVwith 6,000 different voices.
p461
aVAnd collectively, those voices become our human repertoire
p462
aVfor dealing with the challenges that will confront us
p463
aVin the ensuing millennia.

aVThat shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone
p468
aVthat we have all of the answers
p469
aVfor all of the questions that will confront us
p470
aVin the ensuing millennia.
p471
aVThe myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.
p472
aVThey are unique answers to that fundamental question:
p473
aVwhat does it mean to be human and alive?
p474
aVAnd there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,
p475
aVtaking with it not only plants and animals,
p476

VRight now, as we sit here in this room,
p479
aVof those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,
p480
aVfully half aren't being taught to children.
p481
aVSo, you're living through a time
p482
aVwhen virtually half of humanity's intellectual,
p483
aVsocial and spiritual legacy
p484
aVis being allowed to slip away.
p485
aVThis does not have to happen.

VIn every case, these are dynamic, living peoples

aVbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces.
p492
aVThat's actually an optimistic observation,
p493
aVbecause it suggests that if human beings
p494
aVare the agents of cultural destruction,
p495
aVwe can also be, and must be,

aVthe facilitators of cultural survival.
