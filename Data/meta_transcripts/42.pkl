VIf you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:
p4
aVtheir interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.
p5
aVThe odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVMy talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,
p8
aVand then as a worried member of the human race.
p9
aVBut let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed
p10
aVhow we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
p11
aVAnd what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology
p12
aVis to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,
p13
aVto set our Earth in a cosmic context.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd let me just run through a few slides.
p16
aVThis was the impact that happened last week on a comet.
p17
aVIf they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular
p18
aVthan what actually happened last Monday.
p19
aVSo that's another project for NASA.
p20
aVThat's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
p21
aVThis artist's impression turned into reality
p22
aVwhen a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
p23
aVIt landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
p24
aVThat looks like a coastline.
p25
aVIt is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane \u2014
p26
aVthe temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.
p27
aVIf we go beyond our solar system,
p28
aVwe've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
p29
aVEach one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
p30
aVAnd we can see places where stars are forming,
p31
aVlike the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.
p32
aVIn six billion years, the sun will look like that.
p33
aVAnd some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,
p34
aVleaving remnants like that.
p35
aa(lp36
VOn a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
p37
aVWe see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
p38
aVAnd to the cosmologist,
p39
aVthese galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.
p40
aVThis picture shows a patch of sky
p41
aVso small that it would take about 100 patches like it
p42
aVto cover the full moon in the sky.
p43
aVThrough a small telescope, this would look quite blank,
p44
aVbut you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
p45
aVEach is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,
p46
aVwhich looks so small and faint because its light
p47
aVhas taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
p48
aVThe stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
p49
aVThere's scant chance of life there \u2014 that's because there's been no time
p50
aVfor the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,
p51
aVthe building blocks of planets and of life.
p52
aVWe believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang \u2014
p53
aVa hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang
p54
aVturn into our complex cosmos?
p55
aa(lp56
VI'm going to show you a movie simulation
p57
aV16 powers of 10 faster than real time,
p58
aVwhich shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
p59
aVBut you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,
p60
aVyou will see structures evolve as gravity feeds
p61
aVon small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.
p62
aVAnd we'll end up after 13 billion years
p63
aVwith something looking rather like our own universe.
p64
aVAnd we compare simulated universes like that \u2014
p65
aVI'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk \u2014
p66
aVwith what we actually see in the sky.
p67
aVWell, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,
p68
aVbut we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
p69
aa(lp70
VThat's a challenge for 21st-century science.
p71
aVIf my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:
p72
aVan ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left \u2014
p73
aVthe world of the quantum \u2014 and on the right
p74
aVthe large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
p75
aVWe know our universes are united though \u2014
p76
aVlinks between left and right.
p77
aVThe everyday world is determined by atoms,
p78
aVhow they stick together to make molecules.
p79
aVStars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
p80
aVAnd, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together
p81
aVby the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:
p82
aVparticles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.
p83
aVBut we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
p84
aVThe micro-world of the quantum is understood.
p85
aVOn the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
p86
aVBut the unfinished business for 21st-century science
p87
aVis to link together cosmos and micro-world
p88
aVwith a unified theory \u2014 symbolized, as it were, gastronomically
p89
aVat the top of that picture. (Laughter)
p90
aVAnd until we have that synthesis,
p91
aVwe won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe
p92
aVbecause when our universe was itself the size of an atom,
p93
aVquantum effects could shake everything.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,
p96
aVwhich we don't yet have.
p97
aVOne idea, incidentally \u2014
p98
aVand I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on \u2014
p99
aVis that our Big Bang was not the only one.
p100
aVOne idea is that our three-dimensional universe
p101
aVmay be embedded in a high-dimensional space,
p102
aVjust as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
p103
aVYou can imagine ants on one of them
p104
aVthinking it's a two-dimensional universe,
p105
aVnot being aware of another population of ants on the other.
p106
aVSo there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,
p107
aVbut we're not aware of it because that millimeter
p108
aVis measured in some fourth spatial dimension,
p109
aVand we're imprisoned in our three.
p110
aVAnd so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality
p111
aVthan what we've normally called our universe \u2014
p112
aVthe aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
p113
aVBottom right depicts our universe,
p114
aVwhich on the horizon is not beyond that,
p115
aVbut even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
p116
aVMany people suspect that just as we've gone from believing
p117
aVin one solar system to zillions of solar systems,
p118
aVone galaxy to many galaxies,
p119
aVwe have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,
p120
aVperhaps these many Big Bangs displaying
p121
aVan immense variety of properties.
p122
aa(lp123
VWell, let's go back to this picture.
p124
aVThere's one challenge symbolized at the top,
p125
aVbut there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
p126
aVYou want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,
p127
aVbut we want to understand the very complex.
p128
aVAnd the most complex things are ourselves,
p129
aVmidway between atoms and stars.
p130
aVWe depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
p131
aVWe depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
p132
aVWe clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,
p133
aVto have layer upon layer of complex structure.
p134
aVWe clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets \u2014
p135
aVotherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
p136
aVIt would take as many human bodies to make up the sun
p137
aVas there are atoms in each of us.
p138
aVThe geometric mean of the mass of a proton
p139
aVand the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,
p140
aVwithin a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
p141
aVWell, most of you anyway.
p142
aVThe science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,
p143
aVgreater than that of the very small on the left
p144
aVand the very large on the right.
p145
aVAnd it's this science,
p146
aVwhich is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,
p147
aVbut also transforming our world faster than ever.
p148
aVAnd more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I now move on to the second part of my talk,
p151
aVand the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.
p152
aVIf I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,
p153
aVand I would add that it's available in paperback.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd in America it was called "Our Final Hour"
p158
aVbecause Americans like instant gratification.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VBut my theme is that in this century,
p163
aVnot only has science changed the world faster than ever,
p164
aVbut in new and different ways.
p165
aVTargeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,
p166
aVperhaps even implants into our brains,
p167
aVmay change human beings themselves. And human beings,
p168
aVtheir physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
p169
aVIt may change this century.
p170
aVIt's new in our history.
p171
aVAnd the human impact on the global environment \u2014 greenhouse warming,
p172
aVmass extinctions and so forth \u2014 is unprecedented, too.
p173
aVAnd so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
p174
aVBio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign
p175
aVin that they offer marvelous prospects,
p176
aVwhile, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
p177
aVBut they will have a dark side.
p178
aVIn our interconnected world, novel technology could empower
p179
aVjust one fanatic,
p180
aVor some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,
p181
aVto trigger some kind on disaster.
p182
aVIndeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure \u2014
p183
aVerror rather than terror.
p184
aVAnd even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable
p185
aVwhen the downside could be of global consequence.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article
p188
aVexpressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
p189
aVI don't go along with all that,
p190
aVbut it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
p191
aVIt was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
p192
aVHe wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science
p193
aVand keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
p194
aVFirst, any scientific discovery has benign consequences
p195
aVas well as dangerous ones.
p196
aVAnd also, when a scientist makes a discovery,
p197
aVhe or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
p198
aVAnd so what this means is that we have to accept the risks
p199
aVif we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
p200
aVWe have to accept that there will be hazards.
p201
aVAnd I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,
p202
aVpost-World War II, when the nuclear scientists
p203
aVwho'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,
p204
aVin many cases were concerned that they should do all they could
p205
aVto alert the world to the dangers.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd they were inspired not by the young Einstein,
p208
aVwho did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,
p209
aVthe icon of poster and t-shirt,
p210
aVwho failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
p211
aVHe was premature. But he was a moral compass \u2014
p212
aVan inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
p213
aVAnd perhaps the greatest living person
p214
aVis someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
p215
aVEqually untidy office there, as you can see.
p216
aVHe's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
p217
aVHe persuaded Einstein, as his last act,
p218
aVto sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
p219
aVAnd he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
p220
aVAnd I think to harness science optimally,
p221
aVto choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,
p222
aVwe need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe need not just campaigning physicists,
p225
aVbut we need biologists, computer experts
p226
aVand environmentalists as well.
p227
aVAnd I think academics and independent entrepreneurs
p228
aVhave a special obligation because they have more freedom
p229
aVthan those in government service,
p230
aVor company employees subject to commercial pressure.
p231
aVI wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,
p232
aVjust a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,
p233
aVin which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,
p234
aVand that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
p235
aVThe stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past
p236
aVare now part of common culture \u2014
p237
aVoutside the American Bible Belt, anyway \u2014
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVbut most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,
p240
aVaren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,
p243
aVbut it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
p244
aVOn that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.
p245
aVAnd it'll be another six billion before that happens,
p246
aVand any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
p247
aVThere's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,
p248
aVexperiencing the sun's demise,
p249
aVbut any life and intelligence that exists then
p250
aVwill be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
p251
aVThe unfolding of intelligence and complexity
p252
aVstill has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
p253
aVSo we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
p254
aVin our Earth and beyond.
p255
aVIf you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,
p256
aVsay from January when it was made to December,
p257
aVthe 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June \u2014
p258
aVa tiny fraction of the year.
p259
aVBut even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,
p260
aVour century is very, very special,
p261
aVthe first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
p262
aa(lp263
VAs I should have shown this earlier,
p264
aVit will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;
p265
aVit will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
p266
aVWhen Einstein died in 1955,
p267
aVone striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon
p268
aVby Herblock in the Washington Post.
p269
aVThe plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
p270
aVAnd I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
p271
aVWe've been familiar for 40 years with this image:
p272
aVthe fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,
p273
aVcontrasted with the sterile moonscape
p274
aVon which the astronauts left their footprints.
p275
aVBut let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot
p276
aVin the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,
p277
aVbut for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
p278
aVWhat would they have seen?
p279
aVOver nearly all that immense time,
p280
aVEarth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
p281
aVThe only abrupt worldwide change
p282
aVwould have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
p283
aVApart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
p284
aa(lp285
VThe continental landmasses drifted around.
p286
aVIce cover waxed and waned.
p287
aVSuccessions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
p288
aVBut in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,
p289
aVthe last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,
p290
aVthe patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
p291
aVThis signaled the start of agriculture.
p292
aVChange has accelerated as human populations rose.
p293
aVThen other things happened even more abruptly.
p294
aVWithin just 50 years \u2014
p295
aVthat's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age \u2014
p296
aVthe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,
p297
aVand ominously fast.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe planet became an intense emitter of radio waves \u2014
p300
aVthe total output from all TV and cell phones
p301
aVand radar transmissions. And something else happened.
p302
aVMetallic objects \u2014 albeit very small ones, a few tons at most \u2014
p303
aVescaped into orbit around the Earth.
p304
aVSome journeyed to the moons and planets.
p305
aVA race of advanced extraterrestrials
p306
aVwatching our solar system from afar
p307
aVcould confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
p308
aVBut could they have predicted this unprecedented spike
p309
aVless than halfway through the Earth's life?
p310
aVThese human-induced alterations
p311
aVoccupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime
p312
aVand seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
p313
aVIf they continued their vigil,
p314
aVwhat might these hypothetical aliens witness
p315
aVin the next hundred years?
p316
aVWill some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
p317
aVOr will the biosphere stabilize?
p318
aVOr will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth
p319
aVspawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
p320
aa(lp321
VThe science done by the young Einstein will continue
p322
aVas long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,
p323
aVwe'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein \u2014
p324
aVhumane, global and farseeing.
p325
aVAnd whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century
p326
aVwill resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,
p327
aVfar beyond the Earth as depicted here.
