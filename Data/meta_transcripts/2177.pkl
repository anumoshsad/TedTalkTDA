VWhen I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago,
p4
aVwe discussed a number  of titles with the organizers,
p5
aVand a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed.
p6
aVBut nobody suggested this one,
p7
aVand the reason for that was two months ago,
p8
aVEbola was escalating exponentially
p9
aVand spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen,
p10
aVand the world was terrified,  concerned and alarmed
p11
aVby this disease, in a way we've not  seen in recent history.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut today, I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola
p14
aVbecause of people  whom you've never heard of,
p15
aVpeople like Peter Clement, a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County,
p16
aVa place that many of you have  never heard of, probably, in Liberia.
p17
aVThe reason that Lofa County  is so important
p18
aVis because about five months ago,
p19
aVwhen the epidemic was  just starting to escalate,
p20
aVLofa County was right at the center,  the epicenter of this epidemic.
p21
aVAt that time, MSF and the treatment center there,
p22
aVthey were seeing dozens of patients  every single day,
p23
aVand these patients, these communities were becoming more and more terrified
p24
aVas time went by, with this disease  and what it was doing to their families,
p25
aVto their communities,  to their children, to their relatives.
p26
aVAnd so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that 12-hour-long rough road
p27
aVfrom Monrovia, the capital, up to Lofa County,
p28
aVto try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you.
p31
aVSo he sat down with the local chiefs,  and he listened.
p32
aVAnd what he heard was heartbreaking.
p33
aVHe heard about the devastation  and the desperation
p34
aVof people affected by this disease.
p35
aVHe heard the heartbreaking stories
p36
aVabout not just the damage that Ebola did to people,
p37
aVbut what it did to families  and what it did to communities.
p38
aVAnd he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him \u2014
p39
aVThey said, "When our children are sick,  when our children are dying,
p40
aVwe can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them.
p41
aVWhen our relatives die, we can't take care of them as our tradition demands.
p42
aVWe are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them
p43
aVthe way our communities and  our rituals demand.
p44
aVAnd for this reason, they were deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed
p45
aVand the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them.
p46
aa(lp47
VPeople were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come,
p48
aVthe heroes who had come to try  and help save the community,
p49
aVto help work with the community, and they were unable to access them.
p50
aVAnd what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders.
p51
aVThe leaders listened.  They turned the tables.
p52
aVAnd Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was.
p53
aVHe explained what it did to their communities.
p54
aVAnd he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human.
p55
aVEbola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation.
p56
aVYou can't bury your dead  the way that you would.
p57
aVYou have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd ladies and gentlemen, what  happened then was rather extraordinary:
p60
aVThe community and the health workers,  Peter, they sat down together
p61
aVand they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.
p62
aVAnd the reason that this is such  an important story, ladies and gentlemen,
p63
aVis because today, this county, which is  right at the center of this epidemic
p64
aVyou've been watching,  you've been seeing in the newspapers,
p65
aVyou've been seeing on  the television screens,
p66
aVtoday Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola.
p67
aV(Applause)
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, this doesn't mean that  the job is done, obviously.
p70
aVThere's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there.
p71
aVBut what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten.
p72
aVThat's the key thing.
p73
aVEven on this scale,
p74
aVeven with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here,
p75
aVwe now know Ebola can be beaten.
p76
aVWhen communities come together  with health care workers, work together,
p77
aVthat's when this disease can be stopped.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place?
p80
aVWell, for that, we have to go back  12 months, to the start of this epidemic.
p81
aVAnd as many of you know,  this virus went undetected,
p82
aVit evaded detection for three  or four months when it began.
p83
aVThat's because this is not  a disease of West Africa,
p84
aVit's a disease of Central Africa,  half a continent away.
p85
aVPeople hadn't seen the disease before;
p86
aVhealth workers hadn't seen  the disease before.
p87
aVThey didn't know what  they were dealing with,
p88
aVand to make it  even more complicated,
p89
aVthe virus itself was causing a symptom, a type of a presentation
p90
aVthat wasn't classical of the disease.
p91
aVSo people didn't even recognize  the disease, people who knew Ebola.
p92
aVFor that reason it evaded detection  for some time,
p93
aa(lp94
VBut contrary to public belief  sometimes these days,
p95
aVonce the virus was detected,  there was a rapid surge in of support.
p96
aVMSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center, as many of you know, in the area.
p97
aVThe World Health Organization and the partners that it works with
p98
aVdeployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months
p99
aVto be able to help track the virus.
p100
aVThe problem, ladies and gentlemen, is by then, this virus,
p101
aVwell known now as Ebola,  had spread too far.
p102
aVIt had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses
p103
aVthat had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak.
p104
aa(lp105
VBy the middle of the year, not just Guinea
p106
aVbut now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected.
p107
aVAs the virus was spreading geographically, the numbers were increasing
p108
aVand at this time, not only were  hundreds of people infected
p109
aVand dying of the disease,
p110
aVbut as importantly, the front line responders,
p111
aVthe people who had gone to try and help,
p112
aVthe health care workers, the other  responders
p113
aVwere also sick and dying by the dozens.
p114
aVThe presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies.
p115
aVThey met right around that time,  they agreed on common action
p116
aVand they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry
p117
aVto try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped,
p118
aVto implement the strategies we talked about.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola.
p121
aVWhat happened then was the virus,  or someone sick with the virus,
p122
aVboarded an airplane,  flew to another country,
p123
aVand for the first time, we saw in another distant country
p124
aVthe virus pop up again.
p125
aVThis time it was in Nigeria, in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,
p126
aV21 million people.
p127
aVNow the virus was in that environment.
p128
aVAnd as you can anticipate,  there was international alarm,
p129
aVinternational concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years
p130
aVcaused by a disease like this.
p131
aVThe World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel,
p132
aVlooked at the situation,  declared an international emergency.
p133
aVAnd in doing so, the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring
p134
aVof international assistance to help these countries
p135
aVwhich were in so much trouble and concern at that time.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut what we saw was  something very different.
p138
aVThere was some great response.
p139
aVA number of countries came to assist \u2014 many, many NGOs and others, as you know,
p140
aVbut at the same time, the opposite  happened in many places.
p141
aVAlarm escalated, and very soon  these countries found themselves
p142
aVnot receiving the support they needed, but increasingly isolated.
p143
aVWhat we saw was commercial airlines [stopped] flying into these countries
p144
aVand people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus
p145
aVwere no longer allowed to travel.
p146
aVThis caused not only problems, obviously,  for the countries themselves,
p147
aVbut also for the response.
p148
aVThose organizations that were  trying to bring people in,
p149
aVto try and help them respond to the outbreak,
p150
aVthey could not get  people on airplanes,
p151
aVthey could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond.
p152
aVIn that situation, ladies and gentleman,
p153
aVa virus like Ebola takes advantage.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before.
p156
aVNot only did this virus  continue in the places
p157
aVwhere they'd already become infected, but then it started to escalate
p158
aVand we saw the case numbers that you see here,
p159
aVsomething we'd never seen before on such a scale,
p160
aVan exponential increase of Ebola cases
p161
aVnot just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries
p162
aVbut also spreading further and  deeper into these countries.
p163
aVLadies and gentleman, this was one of the most concerning
p164
aVinternational emergencies in public health we've ever seen.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd what happened in these countries then,
p167
aVmany of you saw, again, on the television, read about in the newspapers,
p168
aVwe saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic.
p169
aVWe saw the schools begin to close,  markets no longer started,
p170
aVno longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries.
p171
aVWe saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread
p172
aVeven faster through the communities, which became even more alarmed
p173
aVabout the situation.
p174
aVThey started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits,
p175
aVas they call them,  who had come to help them.
p176
aVAnd then the situation deteriorated even further.
p177
aVThe countries had to declare a state of emergency.
p178
aVLarge populations needed to be quarantined in some areas, and then riots broke out.
p179
aVIt was a very, very terrifying situation.
p180
aa(lp181
VAround the world, many people began to ask,
p182
aVcan we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this?
p183
aVAnd they started to ask, how well  do we really know this virus?
p184
aVThe reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well.
p185
aVIt's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it.
p186
aVWe've known the disease only for 40 years,
p187
aVsince it first popped up in Central Africa in 1976.
p188
aVBut despite that, we do know many things:
p189
aVWe know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat.
p190
aVWe know that it probably enters  a human population
p191
aVwhen we come in contact with a wild animal
p192
aVthat has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it.
p193
aVThen we know that the virus spreads from person to person
p194
aVthrough contaminated body fluids.
p195
aVAnd as you've all seen,
p196
aVwe know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans,
p197
aVwhere we see this disease cause severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,
p198
aVand then unfortunately, in 70 percent of the cases or often more, death.
p199
aVThis is a very dangerous, debilitating, and deadly disease.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time,
p202
aVand we don't know everything about it, we do know how to stop this disease.
p203
aVThere are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola.
p204
aVFirst and foremost, the communities  have got to understand this disease,
p205
aVthey've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case,
p208
aVevery contact of those cases,
p209
aVand begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission.
p210
aVWe have to have treatment centers, specialized Ebola treatment centers,
p211
aVwhere the workers can be protected
p212
aVas they try to provide support to the people who are infected,
p213
aVso that they might survive the disease.
p214
aVAnd then for those who do die,
p215
aVwe have to ensure there is a safe, but at the same time dignified, burial process,
p216
aVso that there is no spread  at that time as well.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo we do know how to stop Ebola, and these strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.
p219
aVThe virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies
p220
aVand the people implementing  them, obviously.
p221
aVIt was stopped in Senegal, where it had spread, and also in the other countries
p222
aVthat were affected by this virus,  in this outbreak.
p223
aVSo there's no question that  these strategies actually work.
p224
aVThe big question, ladies and gentlemen, was whether these strategies could work
p225
aVon this scale, in this situation, with so many countries affected
p226
aVwith the kind of exponential  growth that you saw.
p227
aa(lp228
VThat was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago.
p229
aVToday we know the answer to that question.
p230
aVAnd we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work
p231
aVof an incredible group of NGOs, of governments, of local leaders,
p232
aVof U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations
p233
aVthat came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut what had to be done there  was slightly different.
p236
aVThese countries took those strategies  I just showed you;
p237
aVthe community engagement, the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,
p238
aVand they turned them on their head.
p239
aVThere was so much disease, they approached it differently.
p240
aVWhat they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic
p241
aVby rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers
p242
aVso that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected.
p243
aVThey would rapidly build out many, many burial teams
p244
aVso that they could safely deal with the dead,
p245
aVand with that, they would try  and slow this outbreak
p246
aVto see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach
p247
aVof case finding and contact tracing.
p248
aVAnd when I went to West Africa about three months ago,
p249
aVwhen I was there what I saw was extraordinary.
p250
aVI saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola
p251
aVso that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion
p252
aVthis surge of international support  to try and stop this disease.
p253
aVWe saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond
p254
aVcoming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers
p255
aVthat could be used to isolate  those who were sick.
p256
aVWe saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there
p257
aVto help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead
p258
aVin a dignified manner themselves.
p259
aVAnd we saw the U.N. agencies,  the World Food Program,
p260
aVbuild a tremendous air bridge
p261
aVthat could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly
p262
aVto be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat we saw, ladies and gentlemen,  which was probably most impressive,
p265
aVwas this incredible work by the governments,
p266
aVby the leaders in these countries, with the communities,
p267
aVto try to ensure people  understood this disease,
p268
aVunderstood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola.
p269
aVAnd as a result, ladies and gentlemen,
p270
aVwe saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier,
p271
aVwhether or not it would be possible.
p272
aVWhat we saw was  what you see now in this graph,
p273
aVwhen we took stock on December 1.
p274
aVWhat we saw was we could  bend that curve, so to speak,
p275
aVchange this exponential growth,
p276
aVand bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak.
p277
aVAnd for this reason, ladies and gentlemen, there's absolutely no question now
p278
aVthat we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe big question, though,  that many people are asking,
p281
aVeven when they saw this curve, they said,
p282
aV"Well, hang on a minute \u2014 that's great you can slow it down,
p283
aVbut can you actually drive it down to zero?"
p284
aVWe already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk,
p285
aVwhen I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.
p286
aVWe told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation
p287
aVwhere they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks.
p288
aVBut there are similar stories from  the other countries as well.
p289
aVFrom Gueckedou in Guinea,
p290
aVthe first area where the first case was actually diagnosed.
p291
aa(lp292
VWe've seen very, very few cases in the last couple of months,
p293
aVand here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone,  another area in the epicenter,
p294
aVwe have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks \u2014
p295
aVway too early to declare  victory, obviously,
p296
aVbut evidence, ladies and gentlemen,
p297
aVnot only can the response  catch up to the disease,
p298
aVbut this disease can be driven to zero.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe challenge now, of course,  is doing this on the scale needed
p301
aVright across these three countries, and that is a huge challenge.
p302
aVBecause when you've been at something for this long, on this scale,
p303
aVtwo other big threats  come in to join the virus.
p304
aVThe first of those is complacency,
p305
aVthe risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend,
p306
aVthe media look elsewhere,  the world looks elsewhere.
p307
aVComplacency always a risk.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd the other risk, of course, is when you've been working so hard for so long,
p310
aVand slept so few hours  over the past months,
p311
aVpeople are tired, people become fatigued,
p312
aVand these new risks  start to creep into the response.
p313
aVLadies and gentlemen, I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa.
p314
aVThe people of these countries, the leaders of these countries,
p315
aVthey are not complacent.
p316
aVThey want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries.
p317
aVAnd these people, yes, they're tired,  but they are not fatigued.
p318
aVThey have an energy, they have a courage,
p319
aVthey have the strength  to get this finished.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhat they need, ladies and gentlemen, at this point,
p322
aVis the unwavering support of the  international community,
p323
aVto stand with them,
p324
aVto bolster and bring even more support  at this time, to get the job finished.
p325
aVBecause finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus,
p326
aVand beginning to hunt it.
p327
aa(lp328
VRemember, this virus, this whole crisis,  rather, started with one case,
p329
aVand is going to finish with one case.
p330
aVBut it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists,
p331
aVenough health workers, enough logisticians and enough other people working with them
p332
aVto be able to find every one  of those cases, track their contacts
p333
aVand make sure that this disease  stops once and for all.
p334
aa(lp335
VLadies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.
p336
aVNow we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen
p337
aVand educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola,
p338
aVand more importantly, we need you to advocate with the people
p339
aVwho can help us bring the resources we need to these countries,
p340
aVto beat this disease.
p341
aVThere are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive,
p342
aVin part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola.
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.
