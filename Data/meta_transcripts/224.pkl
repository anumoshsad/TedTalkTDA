VRoy Gould: Less than a year from now,
p4
aVthe world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,
p5
aVwhich marks the 400th anniversary
p6
aVof Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.
p7
aVIn a few months, the world is also going to celebrate
p8
aVthe launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,
p9
aVwhich I think is going to have as profound an impact
p10
aVon the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.
p11
aVIt's called the WorldWide Telescope,
p12
aVand I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.
p13
aVAnd I want to urge you, when you get a chance,
p14
aVto give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe WorldWide Telescope takes the best images
p17
aVfrom the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,
p18
aVand has woven them seamlessly
p19
aVto produce a holistic view of the universe.
p20
aVIt's going to change the way we do astronomy,
p21
aVit's going to change the way we teach astronomy
p22
aVand I think most importantly
p23
aVit's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.
p24
aa(lp25
VIf we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,
p26
aVthat might not be so big a claim.
p27
aVIn 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;
p28
aVif you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;
p29
aVand if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,
p30
aVwhat you saw was thought to be the entire universe.
p31
aVIn fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then
p32
aVgave a great debate in which he argued
p33
aVthat the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.
p34
aa(lp35
VHarvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter)
p36
aVOf course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.
p37
aVWe can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,
p38
aVall the way back in time,
p39
aValmost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.
p40
aVWe can see across the entire spectrum of light,
p41
aVrevealing worlds that had previously been invisible.
p42
aVWe see these magnificent star nurseries,
p43
aVwhere nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers
p44
aVand just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.
p45
aVWe see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems \u2014
p46
aV300 now, and still counting \u2014
p47
aVand they're not like us.
p48
aVWe see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,
p49
aVin the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,
p50
aVwhere time itself seems to stand still.
p51
aVBut until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,
p52
aVand I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us
p53
aVhave fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.
p54
aa(lp55
VI want to just briefly mention three reasons
p56
aVwhy my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,
p57
aVare so excited about the WorldWide Telescope
p58
aVand why we think it's truly transformative.
p59
aVFirst, it enables you to experience the universe:
p60
aVthe WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet
p61
aVthat lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.
p62
aVSecond: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.
p63
aVAnd I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,
p64
aVbut really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,
p65
aVwho can share their enthusiasm
p66
aVand can make the universe a welcoming place.
p67
aVAnd third, you can create your own tours \u2014
p68
aVyou can share them with friends, you can create them with friends \u2014
p69
aVand that's the part that I think I'm most excited about
p70
aVbecause I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.
p71
aVAnd in telling stories,
p72
aVeach of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.
p73
aVWe're going to have a personal universe.
p74
aVI think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.
p75
aa(lp76
VBefore I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,
p77
aVI just want to leave you with this brief thought:
p78
aVwhen I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"
p79
aVthey often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."
p80
aVWell, our gaze fills the universe.
p81
aVAnd thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,
p82
aVwe can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.
p83
aVI think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you
p84
aVthat we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.
p85
aVThank you.
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VI can't tell you what a privilege it is
p89
aVto introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VCurtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.
p92
aVSo, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,
p93
aVbut it's one of the tours.
p94
aVAnd actually this tour is one that was created earlier.
p95
aVAnd the tours are all totally interactive,
p96
aVso that if I were to go somewhere ...
p97
aVyou may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,
p98
aVpull up other information \u2014
p99
aVthere are lots of Web and information sources
p100
aVabout places you might want to go \u2014
p101
aVyou can zoom in, you can pull back out.
p102
aVThe whole resources are there available for you.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, Microsoft \u2014 this is a project that \u2014 WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,
p105
aVwho's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did
p106
aVis really what makes this project possible.
p107
aVIt's a labor of love for us and our small team,
p108
aVand we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
p109
aVSo basically, kids of all ages, like us.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.
p112
aVIt'll be a free download \u2014 thank you, Craig Mundie \u2014
p113
aVand it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,
p114
aVwhich is something new.
p115
aVAnd so, what you've seen today
p116
aVis less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,
p117
aVand in the TED Lab, we have a tour
p118
aVthat was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin
p119
aVthat will knock your socks off. (Laughter)
p120
aVSo we'll see you there. Thank you.
