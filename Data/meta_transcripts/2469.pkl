VPeople returning to work after a career break:
p4
aVI call them relaunchers.
p5
aVThese are people who have taken career breaks for elder care,
p6
aVfor childcare reasons,
p7
aVpursuing a personal interest
p8
aVor a personal health issue.
p9
aVClosely related are career transitioners of all kinds:
p10
aVveterans, military spouses,
p11
aVretirees coming out of retirement
p12
aVor repatriating expats.
p13
aVReturning to work after a career break is hard
p14
aVbecause of a disconnect between the employers
p15
aVand the relaunchers.
p16
aVEmployers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume
p17
aVas a high-risk proposition,
p18
aVand individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities
p19
aVto relaunch their careers,
p20
aVespecially if they've been out for a long time.
p21
aVThis disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field.
p24
aVThis is Sami Kafala.
p25
aVHe's a nuclear physicist in the UK
p26
aVwho took a five-year career break to be home with his five children.
p27
aVThe Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work
p28
aVafter long career breaks.
p29
aVAnd speaking of long career breaks,
p30
aVthis is Mimi Kahn.
p31
aVShe's a social worker in Orange County, California,
p32
aVwho returned to work in a social services organization
p33
aVafter a 25-year career break.
p34
aVThat's the longest career break that I'm aware of.
p35
aVSupreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
p36
aVtook a five-year career break early in her career.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break.
p39
aVTracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show
p40
aVfrom people who were trying to return to work
p41
aVbut having a difficult time of it.
p42
aVTracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home,
p43
aVbut she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work,
p44
aVplus she really wanted to bring work back into her life
p45
aVbecause she loved working.
p46
aVTracy was doing what so many of us do
p47
aVwhen we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search.
p48
aVShe was looking for a finance or accounting role,
p49
aVand she had just spent the last nine months
p50
aVvery diligently researching companies online
p51
aVand applying for jobs with no results.
p52
aa(lp53
VI met Tracy in June of 2011,
p54
aVwhen the Today Show asked me if I could work with her
p55
aVto see if I could help her turn things around.
p56
aVThe first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house.
p57
aVI told her she had to go public with her job search
p58
aVand tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.
p59
aVI also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations
p60
aVthat don't go anywhere.
p61
aVExpect that, and don't be discouraged by it.
p62
aVThere will be a handful
p63
aVthat ultimately lead to a job opportunity."
p64
aa(lp65
VI'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit,
p66
aVbut I want to share with you a discovery that I made
p67
aVwhen I was returning to work
p68
aVafter my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce.
p69
aVAnd that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time.
p70
aVWhat I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people
p71
aVand you get back in touch with those people from the past,
p72
aVthe people with whom you worked or went to school,
p73
aVthey are going to remember you as you were
p74
aVbefore your career break.
p75
aVAnd that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time,
p76
aVas happens with so many of us
p77
aVthe farther removed we are from our professional identities.
p78
aVSo for example, you might think of yourself
p79
aVas someone who looks like this.
p80
aVThis is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan.
p81
aVOr here I am in the kitchen.
p82
aVBut those people from the past,
p83
aVthey don't know about any of this.
p84
aVThey only remember you as you were,
p85
aVand it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people
p86
aVand hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.
p87
aa(lp88
VThere's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break.
p89
aVAnd that was that I hardly kept up with the business news.
p90
aVMy background is in finance,
p91
aVand I hardly kept up with any news
p92
aVwhen I was home caring for my four young children.
p93
aVSo I was afraid I'd go into an interview
p94
aVand start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore.
p95
aVSo I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal
p96
aVand read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt
p97
aVlike I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.
p98
aa(lp99
VI believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce,
p100
aVand here's why.
p101
aVThink about our life stage:
p102
aVfor those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons,
p103
aVwe have fewer or no maternity leaves.
p104
aVWe did that already.
p105
aVWe have fewer spousal or partner job relocations.
p106
aVWe're in a more settled time of life.
p107
aVWe have great work experience.
p108
aVWe have a more mature perspective.
p109
aVWe're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense.
p110
aVPlus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work
p111
aVprecisely because we've been away from it for a while.
p112
aa(lp113
VOn the flip side, I speak with employers,
p114
aVand here are two concerns that employers have
p115
aVabout hiring relaunchers.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers
p118
aVare technologically obsolete.
p119
aVNow, I can tell you,
p120
aVhaving been technologically obsolete myself at one point,
p121
aVthat it's a temporary condition.
p122
aVI had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.
p123
aVI don't know if anyone can even remember back that far,
p124
aVbut I had to relearn it on Excel.
p125
aVIt actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same.
p126
aVI found PowerPoint much more challenging,
p127
aVbut now I use PowerPoint all the time.
p128
aVI tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table
p129
aVwith a working knowledge of basic office management software.
p130
aVAnd if they're not up to speed,
p131
aVthen it's their responsibility to get there.
p132
aVAnd they do.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers
p135
aVis they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do.
p136
aVI tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work
p137
aVto figure out whether their interests and skills have changed
p138
aVor have not changed
p139
aVwhile they have been on career break.
p140
aVThat's not the employer's job.
p141
aVIt's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer
p142
aVwhere they can add the most value.
p143
aa(lp144
VBack in 2010 I started noticing something.
p145
aVI had been tracking return to work programs since 2008,
p146
aVand in 2010, I started noticing
p147
aVthe use of a short-term paid work opportunity,
p148
aVwhether it was called an internship or not,
p149
aVbut an internship-like experience,
p150
aVas a way for professionals to return to work.
p151
aVI saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee
p152
aVstart corporate reentry internship programs.
p153
aVI saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate,
p154
aVapply for an entry-level internship program in the military,
p155
aVand then get a permanent job afterward.
p156
aVI saw two universities integrate internships
p157
aVinto mid-career executive education programs.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo I wrote a report about what I was seeing,
p160
aVand it became this article for Harvard Business Review
p161
aVcalled "The 40-Year-Old Intern."
p162
aVI have to thank the editors there for that title,
p163
aVand also for this artwork
p164
aVwhere you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns.
p165
aVAnd then, courtesy of Fox Business News,
p166
aVthey called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VSo five of the biggest financial services companies
p171
aVhave reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals.
p172
aVAnd at this point, hundreds of people have participated.
p173
aVThese internships are paid,
p174
aVand the people who move on to permanent roles
p175
aVare commanding competitive salaries.
p176
aVAnd now, seven of the biggest engineering companies
p177
aVare piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers
p178
aVas part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.
p179
aVNow, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?
p180
aVBecause the internship allows the employer
p181
aVto base their hiring decision on an actual work sample
p182
aVinstead of a series of interviews,
p183
aVand the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision
p184
aVuntil the internship period is over.
p185
aVThis testing out period removes the perceived risk
p186
aVthat some managers attach to hiring relaunchers,
p187
aVand they are attracting excellent candidates
p188
aVwho are turning into great hires.
p189
aa(lp190
VThink about how far we have come.
p191
aVBefore this, most employers were not interested
p192
aVin engaging with relaunchers at all.
p193
aVBut now, not only are programs being developed
p194
aVspecifically with relaunchers in mind,
p195
aVbut you can't even apply for these programs
p196
aVunless you have a gap on your résumé.
p197
aa(lp198
VThis is the mark of real change,
p199
aVof true institutional shift,
p200
aVbecause if we can solve this problem for relaunchers,
p201
aVwe can solve it for other career transitioners too.
p202
aVIn fact, an employer just told me
p203
aVthat their veterans return to work program
p204
aVis based on their reentry internship program.
p205
aVAnd there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program.
p206
aVDifferent pool, same concept.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro.
p209
aVRemember that she had to tell everyone she knew
p210
aVabout her interest in returning to work.
p211
aVWell, one critical conversation with another parent in her community
p212
aVled to a job offer for Tracy,
p213
aVand it was an accounting job in a finance department.
p214
aVBut it was a temp job.
p215
aVThe company told her there was a possibility
p216
aVit could turn into something more, but no guarantees.
p217
aVThis was in the fall of 2011.
p218
aVTracy loved this company, and she loved the people
p219
aVand the office was less than 10 minutes from her house.
p220
aVSo even though she had a second job offer
p221
aVat another company for a permanent full-time role,
p222
aVshe decided to take her chances with this internship
p223
aVand hope for the best.
p224
aVWell, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations,
p225
aVand the company not only made her a permanent offer
p226
aVat the beginning of 2012,
p227
aVbut they made it even more interesting and challenging,
p228
aVbecause they knew what Tracy could handle.
p229
aa(lp230
VFast forward to 2015,
p231
aVTracy's been promoted.
p232
aVThey've paid for her to get her MBA at night.
p233
aVShe's even hired another relauncher to work for her.
p234
aVTracy's temp job was a tryout,
p235
aVjust like an internship,
p236
aVand it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept
p239
aVto more and more employers.
p240
aVBut in the meantime,
p241
aVif you are returning to work after a career break,
p242
aVdon't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement
p243
aVto an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.
p244
aVBe their first success story,
p245
aVand you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you.
