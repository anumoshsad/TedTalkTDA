(lp3
VThe Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"
p4
aVone translation of which is, "The world is sound."
p5
aVAnd in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.
p6
aVIn fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.
p7
aVEvery part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
p8
aVSo you are, in fact, a chord \u2014
p9
aVeach of you an individual chord.
p10
aVOne definition of health may be
p11
aVthat that chord is in complete harmony.
p12
aVYour ears can't hear that chord;
p13
aVthey can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.
p14
aVIncidentally, we see just one octave.
p15
aVYour ears are always on \u2014 you have no ear lids.
p16
aVThey work even when you sleep.
p17
aVThe smallest sound you can perceive
p18
aVmoves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.
p19
aVThe loudest sound you can hear
p20
aVis a trillion times more powerful than that.
p21
aa(lp22
VEars are made not for hearing,
p23
aVbut for listening.
p24
aVListening is an active skill,
p25
aVwhereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at \u2014
p26
aVit's a relationship with sound.
p27
aVAnd yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
p28
aVFor example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,
p29
aVplaces you can listen from?
p30
aVHere are two of them.
p31
aVReductive listening is listening "for."
p32
aVIt reduces everything down to what's relevant
p33
aVand it discards everything that's not relevant.
p34
aVMen typically listen reductively.
p35
aVSo he's saying, "I've got this problem."
p36
aVHe's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."
p37
aVThat's the way we talk, right guys?
p38
aa(lp39
VExpansive listening, on the other hand,
p40
aVis listening "with," not listening "for."
p41
aVIt's got no destination in mind \u2014
p42
aVit's just enjoying the journey.
p43
aVWomen typically listen expansively.
p44
aVIf you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,
p45
aVpossibly both talking at the same time.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVMen, if you get nothing else out of this talk,
p48
aVpractice expansive listening,
p49
aVand you can transform your relationships.
p50
aa(lp51
VThe trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear
p52
aVis noise, surrounding us all the time.
p53
aVNoise like this, according to the European Union,
p54
aVis reducing the health and the quality of life
p55
aVof 25 percent
p56
aVof the population of Europe.
p57
aVTwo percent of the population of Europe \u2014
p58
aVthat's 16 million people \u2014
p59
aVare having their sleep devastated
p60
aVby noise like that.
p61
aVNoise kills
p62
aV200,000 people a year in Europe.
p63
aVIt's a really big problem.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,
p66
aVyou'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.
p67
aVThese days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.
p68
aVIt looks a bit like this.
p69
aVThe trouble with widespread headphone use
p70
aVis it brings three really big health issues.
p71
aVThe first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:
p72
aV"schizophonia."
p73
aVIt's a dislocation
p74
aVbetween what you see and what you hear.
p75
aVSo, we're inviting into our lives
p76
aVthe voices of people who are not present with us.
p77
aVI think there's something deeply unhealthy
p78
aVabout living all the time in schizophonia.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe second problem that comes with headphone abuse
p81
aVis compression.
p82
aVWe squash music to fit it into our pocket
p83
aVand there is a cost attached to this.
p84
aVListen to this \u2014 this is an uncompressed piece of music.
p85
aV(Music)
p86
aVAnd now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.
p87
aV(Music)
p88
aVI do hope that some of you at least
p89
aVcan hear the difference between those two.
p90
aVThere is a cost of compression.
p91
aVIt makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.
p92
aVYou're having to imagine it.
p93
aVIt's not good for you in the long run.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe third problem with headphones is this: deafness \u2014
p96
aVnoise-induced hearing disorder.
p97
aVTen million Americans already have this for one reason or another,
p98
aVbut really worryingly,
p99
aV16 percent \u2014
p100
aVroughly one in six \u2014 of American teenagers
p101
aVsuffer from noise-induced hearing disorder
p102
aVas a result of headphone abuse.
p103
aVOne study at an American university
p104
aVfound that 61 percent of college freshmen
p105
aVhad damaged hearing
p106
aVas a result of headphone abuse.
p107
aVWe may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.
p108
aVNow that's a really serious problem.
p109
aa(lp110
VI'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears
p111
aVand pass these on to your children, please.
p112
aVProfessional hearing protectors are great;
p113
aVI use some all the time.
p114
aVIf you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford
p115
aVbecause quality means you don't have to have it so loud.
p116
aVIf you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,
p117
aVit's too loud.
p118
aVAnd thirdly, if you're in bad sound,
p119
aVit's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.
p120
aVProtect your ears in that way.
p121
aa(lp122
VLet's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.
p123
aVWWB:
p124
aVWind, water, birds \u2014
p125
aVstochastic natural sounds
p126
aVcomposed of lots of individual random events,
p127
aVall of it very healthy,
p128
aVall of it sound that we evolved to over the years.
p129
aVSeek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.
p130
aVSilence is beautiful.
p131
aVThe Elizabethans described language
p132
aVas decorated silence.
p133
aVI urge you to move away from silence with intention
p134
aVand to design soundscapes just like works of art.
p135
aVHave a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.
p136
aVIt's fun to get into designing with sound.
p137
aVIf you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
p138
aVSound design is the future,
p139
aVand I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.
p140
aa(lp141
VI'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,
p142
aVeight ways sound can improve health.
p143
aVFirst, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;
p144
aVit's also now being used to treat cancer.
p145
aVLithotripsy \u2014 saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel
p146
aVby pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
p147
aVSound healing is a wonderful modality.
p148
aVIt's been around for thousands of years.
p149
aVI do urge you to explore this.
p150
aVThere are great things being done there, treating now autism,
p151
aVdementia and other conditions.
p152
aVAnd music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,
p153
aVif it's music that's made with good intention,
p154
aVmade with love, generally.
p155
aVDevotional music, good \u2014 Mozart, good.
p156
aVThere are all sorts of types of music
p157
aVthat are very healthy.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd four modalities where you need to take some action
p160
aVand get involved.
p161
aVFirst of all, listen consciously.
p162
aVI hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.
p163
aVIt's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.
p164
aVSecondly, get in touch with making some sound \u2014
p165
aVcreate sound.
p166
aVThe voice is the instrument we all play,
p167
aVand yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;
p168
aVlearn to sing, learn to play an instrument.
p169
aVMusicians have bigger brains \u2014 it's true.
p170
aVYou can do this in groups as well.
p171
aVIt's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;
p172
aVto make music and sound in a group of people,
p173
aVwhichever style you enjoy particularly.
p174
aVAnd let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
p175
aVProtect your ears? Yes, absolutely.
p176
aVDesign soundscapes to be beautiful around you
p177
aVat home and at work.
p178
aVAnd let's start to speak up
p179
aVwhen people are assailing us
p180
aVwith the noise that I played you early on.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now
p183
aVto improve your health with sound.
p184
aVMy vision is of a world that sounds beautiful
p185
aVand if we all start doing these things,
p186
aVwe will take a very big step in that direction.
p187
aVSo I urge you to take that path.
p188
aa(lp189
VI'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.
p190
aVI wish you sound health.
