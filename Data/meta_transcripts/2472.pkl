VOK, so, confession:
p4
aVI've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.
p5
aVI remember watching Saturday morning cartoons,
p6
aVpaying more attention to the commercials
p7
aVthan to the shows,
p8
aVtrying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.
p9
aVUltimately, that led me to my dream job.
p10
aVI became a partner at a big New York ad agency.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997,
p13
aVwhen my little brother Matt was shot in the head
p14
aVin a shooting that happened on the observation deck
p15
aVof the Empire State Building.
p16
aVSuddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare,
p17
aVbeing told that my brother was going to die,
p18
aVactually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him,
p19
aVthen several emergency brain surgeries
p20
aVand now what's amounted, for Matt,
p21
aVto a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
p22
aVHe is definitely my hero.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut as much as (Applause) \u2014 yeah, deserves it \u2014
p25
aa(lp26
V(Applause)
p27
aa(lp28
VBut as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family,
p29
aVI often think about how much worse it could have been;
p30
aVin fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day
p31
aVwho aren't as fortunate,
p32
aVwho lose loved ones \u2014 brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.
p33
aVThey don't all make national headlines.
p34
aVIn fact, most of them don't.
p35
aVThey go largely unnoticed,
p36
aVin a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic
p37
aVas some kind of new normal.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I quit my job in advertising
p40
aVto try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic,
p41
aVbecause I came to realize
p42
aVthat the challenges to preventing gun violence
p43
aVare actually the same ones that made me love advertising,
p44
aVwhich is to try to figure out how to engage people.
p45
aVOnly instead of doing it to sell products,
p46
aVdoing it to save lives.
p47
aVAnd that comes down to finding common ground,
p48
aVwhere what I want overlaps with what you want.
p49
aVAnd you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence,
p50
aVjust how much common ground there is.
p51
aa(lp52
VLet's look, for example, at people who love to hunt,
p53
aVa sport enjoyed by millions across the US.
p54
aVIt's a proud tradition. Families.
p55
aVIn some places,
p56
aVthe first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.
p57
aVWhat do hunters want?
p58
aVWell, they want to hunt. They love their guns.
p59
aVThey believe deeply
p60
aVin the Second Amendment right to own those guns.
p61
aVBut that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn fact, there's a lot of it,
p64
aVstarting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
p65
aVThis isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.
p66
aVIt's about keeping all guns away from certain people,
p67
aVand it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns:
p68
aVconvicted violent criminals, domestic abusers,
p69
aVthe dangerously mentally ill.
p70
aVWe can all appreciate
p71
aVhow Brady background checks have been incredibly effective
p72
aVin keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.
p73
aVIn 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers
p74
aVhave blocked 2.4 million gun sales
p75
aVto those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate
p80
aVthat there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day
p81
aVat guns shows or online
p82
aVwithout those Brady background checks,
p83
aVjust like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane \u2014
p84
aVone with security and one with no security.
p85
aVAnd \u2014
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public:
p90
aV90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks
p91
aVto all gun sales \u2014 including 90 percent of Republicans,
p92
aVmore than 80 percent of gun owners,
p93
aVmore than 70 percent of NRA members.
p94
aVThis is not a controversial idea.
p95
aVIn fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.
p96
aVThat's about the percentage of the American public
p97
aVthat believes the moon landing was a fake.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd it's also about the percentage that believes the government
p102
aVis putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.
p103
aVThat's the extent to which we agree about background checks.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut what about the 300 million guns
p106
aValready out there in homes across America?
p107
aVWell first, it's important to realize
p108
aVthat those guns are mostly in the hands and homes
p109
aVof decent, law-abiding people like you and me,
p110
aVwho want what we all want \u2014 including keeping our families safe.
p111
aVIn fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.
p112
aVTen years ago, 42 percent of the American public
p113
aVbelieved \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that a gun makes your home safer.
p114
aVToday, that number is 63 percent.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhy?
p117
aVI kind of hate to say it,
p118
aVbecause it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising,
p119
aVwhich is if you tell a big enough lie enough times,
p120
aVeventually that lie becomes the truth.
p121
aVAnd that's exactly what's happened here.
p122
aVThe corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars
p123
aVblocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic
p124
aVof gun violence;
p125
aVblocking pediatricians from talking to parents
p126
aVabout the dangers of guns in the home;
p127
aVblocking smart-gun technology and other technology
p128
aVthat would prevent kids from firing parents' guns
p129
aVand would save lives.
p130
aVThey're desperate to hide the truth,
p131
aVbecause they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd every day,
p134
aVpeople are dying as a result.
p135
aVAnd a lot of those people are children.
p136
aVEvery day in the US,
p137
aVnine kids are just shot unintentionally.
p138
aV900 children and teens take their own lives every year.
p139
aVAnd here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.
p140
aVEven two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home,
p141
aVincluding the terrible tragedy
p142
aVat Sandy Hook.
p143
aVI meet so many of these parents;
p144
aVit's the most heartbreaking part of my job.
p145
aVThese are not bad people.
p146
aVThey're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision,
p147
aVmade based on very bad information
p148
aVthat was put into their minds by very bad people,
p149
aVwho know good and well the misery that they're causing,
p150
aVbut just don't care.
p151
aVAnd the result is a nightmare \u2014
p152
aVnot only for families like mine,
p153
aVbut for, really, at the end of the day, all of us.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence.
p156
aVI'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share,
p157
aVwhich is the dream of a better, safer, future.
p158
aVFor my organization, for the Brady Campaign,
p159
aVthat dream is reflected in the bold goal
p160
aVto cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025.
p161
aVAnd I hope to leave all of you here tonight
p162
aVwith a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach.
p163
aVBecause folks,
p164
aVfor every great movement around the world,
p165
aVthere's a moment where you can look back and say,
p166
aV"That's when things really started to change."
p167
aVAnd I'm here to say
p168
aVthat for the movement to end gun violence in America,
p169
aVthat moment is here.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VWe are so clearly at a tipping point,
p174
aVbecause the American public has come together by the millions
p175
aVlike never before, based on that common ground,
p176
aVto say, "Enough."
p177
aVEnough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters
p178
aVand churches and schools.
p179
aVEnough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets
p180
aVthat's claimed the lives of women and young black men
p181
aVin staggering proportions.
p182
aVEnough of easy access to guns
p183
aVby the people that we all agree shouldn't have them.
p184
aVAnd enough of a small group of craven politicians
p185
aVputting the interests of the corporate gun lobby
p186
aVahead of the people they have been elected to represent.
p187
aVEnough.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me
p192
aVthat are saying it anymore.
p193
aVIt's so much bigger than that.
p194
aVAnd if you want proof,
p195
aVlet's start where most conversations in the US seem to start \u2014
p196
aVwith Kim Kardashian.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd here's the thing: it's not really a joke.
p201
aVI mean, think about when issues change.
p202
aVIt's when they go from being political and advocacy issues
p203
aVto being part of pop culture,
p204
aVvoices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms,
p205
aVmusicians, athletes.
p206
aVThe NBA has come forward.
p207
aVConservative pundits that you never would have imagined
p208
aVhave come forward.
p209
aVThere's real cultural change \u2014
p210
aVI even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year.
p211
aVThat's the extent to which this cultural change is happening.
p212
aVAnd yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal
p213
aVto her 35 million Twitter followers
p214
aVfor expanded background checks.
p215
aa(lp216
VLet's look at the political elections that are heating up.
p217
aVThis used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats.
p218
aVCouldn't run from it fast enough.
p219
aVNow candidates are running on it.
p220
aVSome are being forced to reverse very bad positions
p221
aVthey defended very comfortably, until very recently.
p222
aVFor somebody like me,
p223
aVwatching people wave around their negative NRA ratings \u2014
p224
aVit's almost surreal to watch.
p225
aVWe're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby,
p226
aVand ultimately that needs to change.
p227
aVBut you know what?
p228
aVWe're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side.
p229
aVAnd we're on offense.
p230
aa(lp231
VYou know, they say that the Internet democratizes information.
p232
aVSocial media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it
p233
aVhave democratized activism.
p234
aVIt's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like.
p235
aVSometimes I think of it \u2014
p236
aVyou know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions,
p237
aVkind of like white blood cells.
p238
aVIt's enabled us to start to really close \u2014 and this is the bottom line \u2014
p239
aVclose that disgraceful disconnect
p240
aVbetween what the American public wants
p241
aVand what our elected leaders are doing about it.
p242
aa(lp243
VUntil recently,
p244
aVthe narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side,
p245
aVfrom that six percent,
p246
aVoutnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.
p247
aVWe're flipping that narrative on its head.
p248
aVAfter that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino,
p249
aVwe jammed Congressional switchboards.
p250
aVWe put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours.
p251
aVAnd you know what?
p252
aVWe got a vote on a bill
p253
aVthat nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon.
p254
aVWe're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil,
p255
aVugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade.
p256
aVThe stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken.
p257
aVWe've seen President Obama's historic executive actions.
p258
aVThey don't go all the way,
p259
aVbut they are going to save lives,
p260
aVbecause they expand Brady background checks
p261
aVto thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously.
p262
aVAnd we're marching across the country \u2014 we're not just waiting
p263
aVfor Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity.
p264
aVWe're marching across the country,
p265
aVstate by state, marriage-equality style.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd you know what? We're winning.
p268
aVCongress is almost always the last to wake up and realize
p269
aVthat it's on the wrong side of history.
p270
aVAnd when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them.
p271
aVAnd that's exactly what we're doing right now,
p272
aVas we're in this tipping point.
p273
aa(lp274
VYou know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech
p275
aVto a large group like this, although far less intimidating,
p276
aVand the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching
p277
aVone of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men,"
p278
aVa period TV show about advertising
p279
aVin the 1960s.
p280
aVAnd as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks,
p281
aVI'd glance up at her screen every now and then,
p282
aVand it seemed that every time I did,
p283
aVI'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children
p284
aVor while pregnant or drinking and driving
p285
aVor driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd ultimately it dawned on me:
p288
aVwhat tremendous inspiration
p289
aVto those of us who have this dream to end gun violence.
p290
aVI mean, think about how much the world has changed
p291
aVin a relatively short period of time,
p292
aVhow all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal \u2014
p293
aVsome even glamorous or sexy \u2014
p294
aVhave become stigmatized in just a generation or two,
p295
aVonce they became conversations about our common ground.
p296
aVThat is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create
p297
aVaround gun violence.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd that's my dream,
p300
aVthat maybe someday,
p301
aVsome period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence,
p302
aVand a future generation of children might only be able to imagine
p303
aVhow terrible it must have been.
p304
aa(lp305
