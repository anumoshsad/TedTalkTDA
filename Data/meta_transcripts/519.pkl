VI'm here today, as June said,
p4
aVto talk about a project
p5
aVthat my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
p6
aVWe're crocheting a coral reef.
p7
aVAnd it's a project that we've actually
p8
aVbeen now joined by hundreds of people around the world,
p9
aVwho are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people
p10
aVhave actually been involved in this project,
p11
aVin many of its different aspects.
p12
aVIt's a project that now reaches across three continents,
p13
aVand its roots go into the fields of mathematics,
p14
aVmarine biology, feminine handicraft
p15
aVand environmental activism.
p16
aVIt's true.
p17
aVIt's also a project
p18
aVthat in a very beautiful way,
p19
aVthe development of this
p20
aVhas actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,
p21
aVwhich is a particularly lovely thing to be saying
p22
aVright here in February 2009 \u2014
p23
aVwhich, as one of our previous speakers told us,
p24
aVis the 200th anniversary
p25
aVof the birth of Charles Darwin.
p26
aa(lp27
VAll of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.
p28
aVBut let me first begin by showing you
p29
aVsome pictures of what this thing looks like.
p30
aVJust to give you an idea of scale,
p31
aVthat installation there is about six feet across,
p32
aVand the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
p33
aVThis is some more images of it.
p34
aVThat one on the right is about five feet high.
p35
aVThe work involves hundreds of different crochet models.
p36
aVAnd indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people
p37
aVhave contributed all over the world as part of this.
p38
aVThe totality of this project
p39
aVinvolves tens of thousands of hours
p40
aVof human labor \u2014
p41
aV99 percent of it done by women.
p42
aVOn the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation
p43
aVthat is about 12 feet long.
p44
aa(lp45
VMy sister and I started this project in 2005
p46
aVbecause in that year, at least in the science press,
p47
aVthere was a lot of talk about global warming,
p48
aVand the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.
p49
aVCorals are very delicate organisms,
p50
aVand they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.
p51
aVIt causes these vast bleaching events
p52
aVthat are the first signs of corals of being sick.
p53
aVAnd if the bleaching doesn't go away \u2014
p54
aVif the temperatures don't go down \u2014 reefs start to die.
p55
aVA great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,
p56
aVparticularly in coral reefs all over the world.
p57
aVThis is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
p58
aa(lp59
VWe have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,
p60
aVwhich is a little organization we started
p61
aVto promote, to do projects about the
p62
aVaesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.
p63
aVAnd I went and put a little announcement up on our site,
p64
aVasking for people to join us in this enterprise.
p65
aVTo our surprise, one of the first people who called
p66
aVwas the Andy Warhol Museum.
p67
aVAnd they said they were having an exhibition
p68
aVabout artists' response to global warming,
p69
aVand they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.
p70
aVI laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,
p71
aVyou can have a little bit of it."
p72
aVSo in 2007 we had an exhibition,
p73
aVa small exhibition of this crochet reef.
p74
aVAnd then some people in Chicago came along and they said,
p75
aV"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is
p76
aVglobal warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery
p77
aVand we want you to fill it with your reef."
p78
aVAnd I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."
p79
aVNow I say "naively" because actually
p80
aVmy profession is as a science writer.
p81
aVWhat I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.
p82
aVI've written books about the history of space,
p83
aVthe history of physics and religion,
p84
aVand I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.
p85
aVSo I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
p86
aVSo I said yes to this proposition.
p87
aVAnd I went home, and I told my sister Christine.
p88
aVAnd she nearly had a fit
p89
aVbecause Christine is a professor at one of
p90
aVL.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,
p91
aVand she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
p92
aVShe thought I'd gone off my head.
p93
aVBut she went into crochet overdrive.
p94
aVAnd to cut a long story short, eight months later
p95
aVwe did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's
p96
aV3,000 square foot gallery.
p97
aa(lp98
VBy this stage the project had taken on
p99
aVa viral dimension of its own,
p100
aVwhich got completely beyond us.
p101
aVThe people in Chicago decided
p102
aVthat as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do
p103
aVwas have the local people there make a reef.
p104
aVSo we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.
p105
aVAnd the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.
p106
aVAnd it was exhibited alongside ours.
p107
aVThere were hundreds of people involved in that.
p108
aVWe got invited to do the whole thing
p109
aVin New York, and in London,
p110
aVand in Los Angeles.
p111
aVIn each of these cities, the local citizens,
p112
aVhundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.
p113
aVAnd more and more people get involved in this,
p114
aVmost of whom we've never met.
p115
aVSo the whole thing has sort of morphed
p116
aVinto this organic, ever-evolving creature,
p117
aVthat's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow some of you are sitting here thinking,
p120
aV"What planet are these people on?
p121
aVWhy on earth are you crocheting a reef?
p122
aVWoolenness and wetness aren't exactly
p123
aVtwo concepts that go together.
p124
aVWhy not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
p125
aVCast it in bronze."
p126
aVBut it turns out there is a very good reason
p127
aVwhy we are crocheting it
p128
aVbecause many organisms in coral reefs
p129
aVhave a very particular kind of structure.
p130
aVThe frilly crenulated forms that you see
p131
aVin corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,
p132
aVis a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.
p133
aVAnd the only way that mathematicians know
p134
aVhow to model this structure
p135
aVis with crochet. It happens to be a fact.
p136
aVIt's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,
p137
aVand it's almost impossible to do it on computers.
p138
aVSo what is this hyperbolic geometry
p139
aVthat corals and sea slugs embody?
p140
aa(lp141
VThe next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up
p142
aVto the level of a sea slug.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVThis sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics
p145
aVwhen it was first discovered in the 19th century.
p146
aVBut not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand
p147
aVhow they could model it.
p148
aVIn 1997 a mathematician
p149
aVat Cornell, Daina Taimina,
p150
aVmade the discovery that this structure
p151
aVcould actually be done in knitting and crochet.
p152
aVThe first one she did was knitting.
p153
aVBut you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized
p154
aVcrochet was the better thing.
p155
aVBut what she was doing was actually making a model
p156
aVof a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians
p157
aVhad thought it was actually impossible to model.
p158
aVAnd indeed they thought that anything like this structure
p159
aVwas impossible per se.
p160
aVSome of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years
p161
aVtrying to prove that this structure was impossible.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?
p164
aVBefore hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew
p165
aVabout two kinds of space:
p166
aVEuclidean space, and spherical space.
p167
aVAnd they have different properties.
p168
aVMathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.
p169
aVYou all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.
p170
aVBut mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.
p171
aVAnd what they do is, they do it through the concept
p172
aVof parallel lines.
p173
aVSo here we have a line and a point outside the line.
p174
aVAnd Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?
p175
aVI ask the question, how many lines can I draw through
p176
aVthe point but never meet the original line?"
p177
aVAnd you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?
p178
aVOne. Great. Okay.
p179
aVThat's our definition of a parallel line.
p180
aVIt's a definition really of Euclidean space.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut there is another possibility that you all know of:
p183
aVspherical space.
p184
aVThink of the surface of a sphere \u2014
p185
aVjust like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.
p186
aVI have a straight line on my spherical surface.
p187
aVAnd I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines
p188
aVcan I draw through the point
p189
aVbut never meet the original line?
p190
aVWhat do we mean to talk about
p191
aVa straight line on a curved surface?
p192
aVNow mathematicians have answered that question.
p193
aVThey've understood there is a generalized concept
p194
aVof straightness, it's called a geodesic.
p195
aVAnd on the surface of a sphere,
p196
aVa straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.
p197
aVSo it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.
p198
aVSo we ask the question again,
p199
aV"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,
p200
aVbut never meet the original line?"
p201
aVDoes someone want to guess?
p202
aVZero. Very good.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.
p205
aVIt's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,
p206
aVZero and one.
p207
aVTwo answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.
p208
aVTo a mathematician if there are two answers,
p209
aVand the first two are zero and one,
p210
aVthere is another number that immediately suggests itself
p211
aVas the third alternative.
p212
aVDoes anyone want to guess what it is?
p213
aVInfinity. You all got it right. Exactly.
p214
aVThere is, there's a third alternative.
p215
aVThis is what it looks like.
p216
aVThere's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines
p217
aVthat go through the point and never meet the original line.
p218
aVThis is the drawing.
p219
aVThis nearly drove mathematicians bonkers
p220
aVbecause, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.
p221
aVThinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.
p222
aVBut that's only because I'm projecting it onto a
p223
aVflat surface.
p224
aVMathematicians for several hundred years
p225
aVhad to really struggle with this.
p226
aVHow could they see this?
p227
aVWhat did it mean to actually have a physical model
p228
aVthat looked like this?
p229
aa(lp230
VIt's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.
p231
aVThen our mathematicians come along
p232
aVand said, "There's this thing called a sphere,
p233
aVand the lines come together at the north and south pole."
p234
aVBut you don't know what a sphere looks like.
p235
aVAnd someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."
p236
aVAnd you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.
p237
aVI can touch it. I can play with it."
p238
aVAnd that's exactly what happened
p239
aVwhen Daina Taimina
p240
aVin 1997, showed that you could crochet models
p241
aVin hyperbolic space.
p242
aVHere is this diagram in crochetness.
p243
aVI've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.
p244
aVAnd the lines look curved.
p245
aVBut look, I can prove to you that they're straight
p246
aVbecause I can take any one of these lines,
p247
aVand I can fold along it.
p248
aVAnd it's a straight line.
p249
aVSo here, in wool,
p250
aVthrough a domestic feminine art,
p251
aVis the proof that the most famous postulate
p252
aVin mathematics is wrong.
p253
aV(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd you can stitch all sorts of mathematical
p256
aVtheorems onto these surfaces.
p257
aVThe discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics
p258
aVthat is called non-Euclidean geometry.
p259
aVAnd this is actually the field of mathematics
p260
aVthat underlies general relativity
p261
aVand is actually ultimately going to show us
p262
aVabout the shape of the universe.
p263
aVSo there is this direct line
p264
aVbetween feminine handicraft,
p265
aVEuclid and general relativity.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
p268
aVHere's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate \u2014
p269
aVdidn't know it was impossible to violate,
p270
aVand they're simply getting on with it.
p271
aVThey've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
p272
aVI once asked the mathematicians why it was
p273
aVthat mathematicians thought this structure was impossible
p274
aVwhen sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.
p275
aVTheir answer was interesting.
p276
aVThey said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians
p277
aVsitting around looking at sea slugs."
p278
aVAnd that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
p279
aVIt also says a whole lot of things
p280
aVabout what mathematicians thought mathematics was,
p281
aVwhat they thought it could and couldn't do,
p282
aVwhat they thought it could and couldn't represent.
p283
aVEven mathematicians, who in some sense
p284
aVare the freest of all thinkers,
p285
aVliterally couldn't see
p286
aVnot only the sea slugs around them,
p287
aVbut the lettuce on their plate \u2014
p288
aVbecause lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,
p289
aVthey also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.
p290
aVAnd so in some sense they literally,
p291
aVthey had such a symbolic view of mathematics,
p292
aVthey couldn't actually see what was going on
p293
aVon the lettuce in front of them.
p294
aVIt turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd so, too, we've discovered
p297
aVthat there is an infinite taxonomy
p298
aVof crochet hyperbolic creatures.
p299
aVWe started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,
p300
aVdoing the simple mathematically perfect models.
p301
aVBut we found that when we deviated from the specific
p302
aVsetness of the mathematical code
p303
aVthat underlies it \u2014 the simple algorithm
p304
aVcrochet three, increase one \u2014
p305
aVwhen we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,
p306
aVthe models immediately started to look more natural.
p307
aVAnd all of our contributors, who are an amazing
p308
aVcollection of people around the world,
p309
aVdo their own embellishments.
p310
aVAs it were, we have this ever-evolving,
p311
aVcrochet taxonomic tree of life.
p312
aVJust as the morphology
p313
aVand the complexity of life on earth is never ending,
p314
aVlittle embellishments and complexifications
p315
aVin the DNA code
p316
aVlead to new things like giraffes, or orchids \u2014
p317
aVso too, do little embellishments in the crochet code
p318
aVlead to new and wondrous creatures
p319
aVin the evolutionary tree of crochet life.
p320
aVSo this project really has
p321
aVtaken on this inner organic life of its own.
p322
aVThere is the totality of all the people who have come to it.
p323
aVAnd their individual visions,
p324
aVand their engagement with this mathematical mode.
p325
aa(lp326
VWe have these technologies. We use them.
p327
aVBut why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?
p328
aVFor Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here
p329
aVis that these things suggest
p330
aVthe importance and value of embodied knowledge.
p331
aVWe live in a society
p332
aVthat completely tends to valorize
p333
aVsymbolic forms of representation \u2014
p334
aValgebraic representations,
p335
aVequations, codes.
p336
aVWe live in a society that's obsessed
p337
aVwith presenting information in this way,
p338
aVteaching information in this way.
p339
aVBut through this sort of modality,
p340
aVcrochet, other plastic forms of play \u2014
p341
aVpeople can be engaged with the most abstract,
p342
aVhigh-powered, theoretical ideas,
p343
aVthe kinds of ideas that normally you have to go
p344
aVto university departments to study in higher mathematics,
p345
aVwhich is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.
p346
aVBut you can do it through playing with material objects.
p347
aVOne of the ways that we've come to think about this
p348
aVis that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring
p349
aVand projects like this, we're trying to have
p350
aVkindergarten for grown-ups.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd kindergarten was actually a very formalized
p353
aVsystem of education,
p354
aVestablished by a man named Friedrich Froebel,
p355
aVwho was a crystallographer in the 19th century.
p356
aVHe believed that the crystal was the model
p357
aVfor all kinds of representation.
p358
aVHe developed a radical alternative system
p359
aVof engaging the smallest children
p360
aVwith the most abstract ideas
p361
aVthrough physical forms of play.
p362
aVAnd he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.
p363
aVThe value of education
p364
aVis something that Froebel championed,
p365
aVthrough plastic modes of play.
p366
aa(lp367
VWe live in a society now
p368
aVwhere we have lots of think tanks,
p369
aVwhere great minds go to think about the world.
p370
aVThey write these great symbolic treatises
p371
aVcalled books, and papers,
p372
aVand op-ed articles.
p373
aVWe want to propose, Chrissy and I,
p374
aVthrough The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,
p375
aVwhich is the play tank.
p376
aVAnd the play tank, like the think tank,
p377
aVis a place where people can go
p378
aVand engage with great ideas.
p379
aVBut what we want to propose,
p380
aVis that the highest levels of abstraction,
p381
aVthings like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. \u2014
p382
aVall of this can be engaged with,
p383
aVnot just through purely cerebral algebraic
p384
aVsymbolic methods,
p385
aVbut by literally, physically playing with ideas.
p386
aVThank you very much.
