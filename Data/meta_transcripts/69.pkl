VYou know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
p4
aVand one of the delights of ethnographic research
p5
aVis the opportunity to live amongst those
p6
aVwho have not forgotten the old ways,
p7
aVwho still feel their past in the wind,
p8
aVtouch it in stones polished by rain,
p9
aVtaste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
p10
aVJust to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
p11
aVor the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
p12
aVor that in the Himalaya,
p13
aVthe Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
p14
aVis to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
p15
aVand that is the idea that the world in which we live
p16
aVdoes not exist in some absolute sense,
p17
aVbut is just one model of reality,
p18
aVthe consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
p19
aVthat our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
p22
aVWe're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
p23
aVWe go through initiation rites.
p24
aVWe have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
p25
aVso it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
p26
aVwe all have art.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,
p29
aVthe rhythm of the dance in every culture.
p30
aVAnd whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
p31
aVor the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
p32
aVor the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
p33
aVthe Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
p34
aVor a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara \u2014
p35
aVthis is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
p36
aVa month ago \u2014
p37
aVor indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
p38
aVEverest, the goddess mother of the world.
p39
aa(lp40
VAll of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,
p41
aVother ways of thinking,
p42
aVother ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
p43
aVAnd this is an idea, if you think about it,
p44
aVcan only fill you with hope.
p45
aVNow, together the myriad cultures of the world
p46
aVmake up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
p47
aVthat envelops the planet,
p48
aVand is as important to the well-being of the planet
p49
aVas indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
p50
aVAnd you might think of this cultural web of life
p51
aVas being an ethnosphere,
p52
aVand you might define the ethnosphere
p53
aVas being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
p54
aVideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
p55
aVby the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
p56
aVThe ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.
p57
aVIt's the symbol of all that we are
p58
aVand all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,
p61
aVso too is the ethnosphere
p62
aV\u2014 and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
p63
aVNo biologists, for example, would dare suggest
p64
aVthat 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
p65
aVon the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
p66
aVand yet that \u2014 the most apocalyptic scenario
p67
aVin the realm of biological diversity \u2014
p68
aVscarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
p69
aVin the realm of cultural diversity.
p70
aVAnd the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
p71
aa(lp72
VWhen each of you in this room were born,
p73
aVthere were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
p74
aVNow, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
p75
aVor a set of grammatical rules.
p76
aVA language is a flash of the human spirit.
p77
aVIt's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
p78
aVcomes into the material world.
p79
aVEvery language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
p80
aVa watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,
p83
aVfully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
p84
aVThey're no longer being taught to babies,
p85
aVwhich means, effectively, unless something changes,
p86
aVthey're already dead.
p87
aVWhat could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,
p88
aVto be the last of your people to speak your language,
p89
aVto have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors
p90
aVor anticipate the promise of the children?
p91
aVAnd yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody
p92
aVsomewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,
p93
aVbecause every two weeks, some elder dies
p94
aVand carries with him into the grave the last syllables
p95
aVof an ancient tongue.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,
p98
aVwouldn't the world be a better place
p99
aVif we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,
p100
aVlet's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.
p101
aVLet's make it Kogi."
p102
aVAnd you'll suddenly discover what it would be like
p103
aVto be unable to speak your own language.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd so, what I'd like to do with you today
p106
aVis sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,
p107
aVa brief journey through the ethnosphere,
p108
aVto try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
p109
aVNow, there are many of us who sort of forget
p110
aVthat when I say "different ways of being,"
p111
aVI really do mean different ways of being.
p112
aa(lp113
VTake, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,
p114
aVthe people of the anaconda
p115
aVwho believe that mythologically they came up the milk river
p116
aVfrom the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
p117
aVNow, this is a people who cognitively
p118
aVdo not distinguish the color blue from the color green
p119
aVbecause the canopy of the heavens
p120
aVis equated to the canopy of the forest
p121
aVupon which the people depend.
p122
aVThey have a curious language and marriage rule
p123
aVwhich is called "linguistic exogamy:"
p124
aVyou must marry someone who speaks a different language.
p125
aVAnd this is all rooted in the mythological past,
p126
aVyet the curious thing is in these long houses,
p127
aVwhere there are six or seven languages spoken
p128
aVbecause of intermarriage,
p129
aVyou never hear anyone practicing a language.
p130
aVThey simply listen and then begin to speak.
p131
aa(lp132
VOr, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,
p133
aVthe Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,
p134
aVan astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
p135
aVIn 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
p136
aVand made a critical mistake.
p137
aVThey dropped from the air
p138
aV8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
p139
aVin what we would say to be friendly gestures,
p140
aVforgetting that these people of the rainforest
p141
aVhad never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
p142
aVThey picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
p143
aVtried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
p144
aVfound nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
p145
aVfrom the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
p146
aVBut the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
p147
aVThey speared each other.
p148
aV54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
p149
aVWe traced genealogies back eight generations,
p150
aVand we found two instances of natural death
p151
aVand when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
p152
aVthey admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
p153
aVthat he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
p154
aVBut at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge
p155
aVof the forest that was astonishing.
p156
aVTheir hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces
p157
aVand tell you what species left it behind.
p158
aa(lp159
VIn the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment
p160
aVwhen I was asked by my professor at Harvard
p161
aVif I was interested in going down to Haiti,
p162
aVinfiltrating the secret societies
p163
aVwhich were the foundation of Duvalier's strength
p164
aVand Tonton Macoutes,
p165
aVand securing the poison used to make zombies.
p166
aVIn order to make sense out of sensation, of course,
p167
aVI had to understand something about this remarkable faith
p168
aVof Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
p169
aVOn the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
p170
aVIt's interesting.
p171
aVIf I asked you to name the great religions of the world,
p172
aVwhat would you say?
p173
aVChristianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
p174
aa(lp175
VThere's always one continent left out,
p176
aVthe assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa
p177
aVhad no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
p178
aVand Voodoo is simply the distillation
p179
aVof these very profound religious ideas
p180
aVthat came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
p181
aVBut, what makes Voodoo so interesting
p182
aVis that it's this living relationship
p183
aVbetween the living and the dead.
p184
aVSo, the living give birth to the spirits.
p185
aVThe spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
p186
aVresponding to the rhythm of the dance
p187
aVto momentarily displace the soul of the living,
p188
aVso that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
p189
aVThat's why the Voodooists like to say
p190
aVthat "You white people go to church and speak about God.
p191
aVWe dance in the temple and become God."
p192
aVAnd because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit \u2014
p193
aVhow can you be harmed?
p194
aVSo you see these astonishing demonstrations:
p195
aVVoodoo acolytes in a state of trance
p196
aVhandling burning embers with impunity,
p197
aVa rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
p198
aVto affect the body that bears it
p199
aVwhen catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,
p202
aVthe most extraordinary are the Kogi
p203
aVof the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
p204
aVDescendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
p205
aVwhich once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
p206
aVin the wake of the conquest,
p207
aVthese people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
p208
aVthat soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
p209
aVIn a bloodstained continent,
p210
aVthese people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
p211
aVTo this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
p212
aVbut the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
p213
aVThe young acolytes are taken away from their families
p214
aVat the age of three and four,
p215
aVsequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
p216
aVin stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
p217
aVtwo nine-year periods
p218
aVdeliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
p219
aVthey spend in their natural mother's womb;
p220
aVnow they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
p221
aVAnd for this entire time,
p222
aVthey are inculturated into the values of their society,
p223
aVvalues that maintain the proposition that their prayers
p224
aVand their prayers alone maintain the cosmic \u2014
p225
aVor we might say the ecological \u2014 balance.
p226
aVAnd at the end of this amazing initiation,
p227
aVone day they're suddenly taken out
p228
aVand for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
p229
aVthey see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
p230
aVof first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
p231
aVof the stunningly beautiful landscape,
p232
aVsuddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
p233
aVis affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
p234
aVand says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.
p235
aVIt is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."
p236
aVThey call themselves the "elder brothers"
p237
aVand they say we, who are the younger brothers,
p238
aVare the ones responsible for destroying the world.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, this level of intuition becomes very important.
p241
aVWhenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,
p242
aVwe either invoke Rousseau
p243
aVand the old canard of the "noble savage,"
p244
aVwhich is an idea racist in its simplicity,
p245
aVor alternatively, we invoke Thoreau
p246
aVand say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
p247
aVWell, indigenous people are neither sentimental
p248
aVnor weakened by nostalgia.
p249
aVThere's not a lot of room for either
p250
aVin the malarial swamps of the Asmat
p251
aVor in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
p252
aVthrough time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
p253
aVthat is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,
p254
aVbut on a far subtler intuition:
p255
aVthe idea that the Earth itself can only exist
p256
aVbecause it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow, what does that mean?
p259
aVIt means that a young kid from the Andes
p260
aVwho's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit
p261
aVthat will direct his or her destiny
p262
aVwill be a profoundly different human being
p263
aVand have a different relationship to that resource
p264
aVor that place than a young kid from Montana
p265
aVraised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock
p266
aVready to be mined.
p267
aVWhether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
p268
aVWhat's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship
p269
aVbetween the individual and the natural world.
p270
aVI was raised in the forests of British Columbia
p271
aVto believe those forests existed to be cut.
p272
aVThat made me a different human being
p273
aVthan my friends amongst the Kwagiulth
p274
aVwho believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw
p275
aVand the Crooked Beak of Heaven
p276
aVand the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,
p277
aVspirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow, if you begin to look at the idea
p280
aVthat these cultures could create different realities,
p281
aVyou could begin to understand
p282
aVsome of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
p283
aVIt's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
p284
aVThis is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
p285
aVthe most powerful psychoactive preparation
p286
aVof the shaman's repertoire.
p287
aVWhat makes ayahuasca fascinating
p288
aVis not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
p289
aVbut the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:
p290
aVon the one hand, this woody liana
p291
aVwhich has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
p292
aVharmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic \u2014
p293
aVto take the vine alone
p294
aVis rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
p295
aVdrift across your consciousness \u2014
p296
aVbut it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
p297
aVcalled Psychotria viridis.
p298
aVThis plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
p299
aVvery close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
p300
aV5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
p301
aVIf you've ever seen the Yanomami
p302
aVblowing that snuff up their noses,
p303
aVthat substance they make from a different set of species
p304
aValso contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
p305
aVTo have that powder blown up your nose
p306
aVis rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
p307
aVlined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
p308
aVIt doesn't create the distortion of reality;
p309
aVit creates the dissolution of reality.
p310
aa(lp311
VIn fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes \u2014
p312
aVwho is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
p313
aVwith his discovery of the magic mushrooms
p314
aVin Mexico in the 1930s \u2014
p315
aVI used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines
p316
aVas hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects
p317
aVthere's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VBut the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally
p320
aVbecause they're denatured by an enzyme
p321
aVfound naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
p322
aVThey can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
p323
aVwith some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
p324
aVNow, the fascinating things
p325
aVare that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
p326
aVare MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
p327
aVto potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
p328
aVHow, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
p329
aVdo these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
p330
aVthat when combined in this way,
p331
aVcreated a kind of biochemical version
p332
aVof the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
p333
aa(lp334
VWell, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,"
p335
aVwhich is exposed to be meaningless.
p336
aVBut you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
p337
aa(lp338
VWell, what does that mean?
p339
aVThis tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,
p340
aVall of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,
p341
aVall of which are referable to our eye as one species.
p342
aVAnd then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
p343
aVand they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
p344
aVI mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."
p345
aVWell, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
p346
aVin the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
p347
aVNow, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,
p348
aVbut it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VNow \u2014
p351
aV(Applause) \u2014
p352
aVthe problem \u2014 the problem is that even those of us
p353
aVsympathetic with the plight of indigenous people
p354
aVview them as quaint and colorful
p355
aVbut somehow reduced to the margins of history
p356
aVas the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
p357
aVWell, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,
p358
aVis not going to be remembered for its wars
p359
aVor its technological innovations,
p360
aVbut rather as the era in which we stood by
p361
aVand either actively endorsed or passively accepted
p362
aVthe massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
p363
aVon the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
p364
aVAll cultures through all time
p365
aVhave constantly been engaged in a dance
p366
aVwith new possibilities of life.
p367
aa(lp368
VAnd the problem is not technology itself.
p369
aVThe Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux
p370
aVwhen they gave up the bow and arrow
p371
aVany more than an American stopped being an American
p372
aVwhen he gave up the horse and buggy.
p373
aVIt's not change or technology
p374
aVthat threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,
p375
aVthe crude face of domination.
p376
aVWherever you look around the world,
p377
aVyou discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;
p378
aVthese are dynamic living peoples
p379
aVbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces
p380
aVthat are beyond their capacity to adapt to:
p381
aVwhether it's the egregious deforestation
p382
aVin the homeland of the Penan \u2014
p383
aVa nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak \u2014
p384
aVa people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,
p385
aVand now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution
p386
aVon the banks of the rivers,
p387
aVwhere you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt
p388
aVthat seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
p389
aVto the South China Sea,
p390
aVwhere the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon
p391
aVready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest \u2014
p392
aVor, in the case of the Yanomami,
p393
aVit's the disease entities that have come in,
p394
aVin the wake of the discovery of gold.
p395
aa(lp396
VOr if we go into the mountains of Tibet,
p397
aVwhere I'm doing a lot of research recently,
p398
aVyou'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
p399
aVYou know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
p400
aVis universally condemned, but ethnocide,
p401
aVthe destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,
p402
aVit's universally, in many quarters, celebrated
p403
aVas part of a development strategy.
p404
aVAnd you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
p405
aVuntil you move through it at the ground level.
p406
aVI once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
p407
aVoverland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
p408
aVwith a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
p409
aVthat I understood the face behind the statistics
p410
aVyou hear about:
p411
aV6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
p412
aV1.2 million people killed by the cadres
p413
aVduring the Cultural Revolution.
p414
aVThis young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
p415
aVThat meant he was instantly killed
p416
aVat the time of the Chinese invasion.
p417
aVHis uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
p418
aVthat took the people to Nepal.
p419
aVHis mother was incarcerated
p420
aVfor the crime of being wealthy.
p421
aVHe was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
p422
aVto hide beneath her skirt tails
p423
aVbecause she couldn't bear to be without him.
p424
aVThe sister who had done that brave deed
p425
aVwas put into an education camp.
p426
aVOne day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
p427
aVof Mao, and for that transgression,
p428
aVshe was given seven years of hard labor.
p429
aVThe pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,
p430
aVbut the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.

aa(lp432
VAnd in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:
p433
aVdo we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony
p434
aVor do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
p435
aVMargaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,
p436
aVthat her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards
p437
aVthis blandly amorphous generic world view
p438
aVnot only would we see the entire range of the human imagination
p439
aVreduced to a more narrow modality of thought,
p440
aVbut that we would wake from a dream one day
p441
aVhaving forgotten there were even other possibilities.
p442
aa(lp443
VAnd it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,
p444
aVbeen around for [150,000] years.
p445
aVThe Neolithic Revolution \u2014 which gave us agriculture,
p446
aVat which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;
p447
aVthe poetry of the shaman was displaced
p448
aVby the prose of the priesthood;
p449
aVwe created hierarchy specialization surplus \u2014
p450
aVis only 10,000 years ago.
p451
aVThe modern industrial world as we know it
p452
aVis barely 300 years old.
p453
aVNow, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me
p454
aVthat we have all the answers for all of the challenges
p455
aVthat will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
p456
aVWhen these myriad cultures of the world
p457
aVare asked the meaning of being human,
p458
aVthey respond with 10,000 different voices.
p459
aa(lp460
VAnd it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility
p461
aVof being what we are: a fully conscious species,
p462
aVfully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens
p463
aVfind a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.
p464
aa(lp465
VThis is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island
p466
aVwhen I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,
p467
aVand this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
p468
aVThe Canadian government has not always been kind
p469
aVto the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,
p470
aVto establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
p471
aVThis old man's grandfather refused to go.
p472
aVThe family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,
p473
aVall of his tools.
p474
aVNow, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;
p475
aVthey took advantage of it.
p476
aVThe runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
p477
aVwrapped in caribou hide.
p478
aVSo, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
p479
aVor the blizzard that was blowing.
p480
aVHe simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
p481
aVand defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
p482
aVhe shaped it into the form of a blade.
p483
aVHe put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
p484
aVand as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
p485
aVHe skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
p486
aVtook the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
p487
aVharnessed up an adjacent dog,
p488
aVand disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
p489
aVTalk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)
p490
aa(lp491
VAnd this, in many ways \u2014
p492
aV(Applause) \u2014
p493
aVis a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people
p494
aVand of all indigenous people around the world.
p495
aVThe Canadian government in April of 1999
p496
aVgave back to total control of the Inuit
p497
aVan area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
p498
aVIt's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
p499
aVIt's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.
p500
aVAn amazing example of how a nation-state
p501
aVcan seek restitution with its people.
p502
aa(lp503
VAnd finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious
p504
aVat least to all of all us who've traveled
p505
aVin these remote reaches of the planet,
p506
aVto realize that they're not remote at all.
p507
aVThey're homelands of somebody.
p508
aVThey represent branches of the human imagination
p509
aVthat go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,
p510
aVthe dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,
p511
aVbecome part of the naked geography of hope.
p512
aa(lp513
VSo, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,
p514
aVis, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
p515
aVWe think that polemics \u2014
p516
aV(Applause) \u2014
p517
aVwe think that polemics are not persuasive,
p518
aVbut we think that storytelling can change the world,
p519
aVand so we are probably the best storytelling institution
p520
aVin the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
p521
aV156 nations carry our television channel.
p522
aVOur magazines are read by millions.
p523
aVAnd what we're doing is a series of journeys
p524
aVto the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience
p525
aVto places of such cultural wonder
p526
aVthat they cannot help but come away dazzled
p527
aVby what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
p528
aVembrace gradually, one by one,
p529
aVthe central revelation of anthropology:
p530
aVthat this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
p531
aVthat we can find a way to live
p532
aVin a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
p533
aVwhere all of the wisdom of all peoples
p534
aVcan contribute to our collective well-being.
