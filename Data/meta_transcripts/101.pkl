aVand had \u2014 oh! \u2014 a bit like that! \u2014
p10
aVand the display on it \u2014

aVanyway, the whole thing had burst.
p12
aVAnd I went to the IT guys here
p13
aVand a gentleman mended my computer,
p14
aVand then he said, "What are you doing here?"
p15
aVand I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"
p16
aVand he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."
p17
aVAnd I said, "Do you really?"
p18
