VThis is a sculpture I made,
p4
aVwhich is a way of, kind of, freeing a form
p5
aVinto an object that has different degrees of freedom.
p6
aVSo, it can balance on a point.
p7
aVThis is a bronze ball,
p8
aVan aluminum arm here,
p9
aVand then this wooden disk.
p10
aVAnd the wooden disk was really thought about
p11
aVas something that you'd want to hold on to,
p12
aVand that would glide easily through your hands.
p13
aVThe aluminum is because it's very light.
p14
aVThe bronze is nice hard, durable material
p15
aVthat could roll on the ground.
p16
aVInside of the bronze ball
p17
aVthere's a lead weight
p18
aVthat is free-swinging on an axle
p19
aVthat's on two bearings
p20
aVthat pass in between, across it,
p21
aVlike this, that counterbalance this weight.
p22
aVSo it allows it to roll.
p23
aVAnd the sphere has that balance property
p24
aVthat it always sort of stays still
p25
aVand looks the same from every direction.
p26
aVBut if you put something on top of it,
p27
aVit disbalances it. And so it would tip over.
p28
aVBut in this case because
p29
aVthe interior is free-swinging
p30
aVin relation to the sphere,
p31
aVit can stand up on one point.
p32
aVAnd then there was a second level to this object,
p33
aVwhich is that it \u2014
p34
aVI wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,
p35
aVwhich is the diameter of the Moon
p36
aVand the diameter of the Earth
p37
aVin proportion to each other.
p38
aa(lp39
VI was exploring, really early on,
p40
aVwanting to make things float in the air.
p41
aVAnd I thought up a lot of ideas.
p42
aVThis is sculpture that I made that \u2014
p43
aVit's magnetically levitated.
p44
aVThe thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
p45
aVNormally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.
p46
aVBut it's uh \u2014 let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit
p47
aVwithout, um \u2014 oops.
p48
aVSo this is just floating,
p49
aVfloating on a permanent magnetic field,
p50
aVwhich stabilizes it in all directions.
p51
aVExcept there is a slight tether here,
p52
aVwhich keeps it from going over the top of its field.
p53
aVIt's sort of surfing on a magnetic field
p54
aVat the crest of a wave.
p55
aVAnd that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.
p56
aa(lp57
VI think we could roll the tape, admin.
p58
aVI have a sort of a collection of videos
p59
aVthat I took of different installations, which I could narrate.
p60
aVThis is a sculpture of the Sun
p61
aVand the Earth, in proportion.
p62
aVRepresenting that eight and a half minutes
p63
aVthat it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
p64
aVSo here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter
p65
aVthat was turned of solid bronze.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd here is a similar sculpture.
p68
aVThat's the Sun at that end.
p69
aVAnd then in a series of 55 balls,
p70
aVit reduces, proportionately \u2014 each ball
p71
aVand the spaces between them
p72
aVreduce proportionately,
p73
aVuntil they get down to this little Earth.
p74
aVThis is in a sculpture park in Taejon.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis one is about the Moon
p77
aVand then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.
p78
aVThis is a little stone ball, floating.
p79
aVAs you can see the little tether,
p80
aVthat it's also magnetically levitated.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd then this is the first part of \u2014
p83
aVthis is 109 spheres,
p84
aVsince the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.
p85
aVAnd so this is the size of the Sun.
p86
aVAnd then each of these little spheres
p87
aVis the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
p88
aVIt's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.
p89
aVThis is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
p90
aVI was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VSo this, again, is on the subject \u2014
p93
aVa slice from the equator of the Earth.
p94
aVAnd then the Moon in the center,
p95
aVand it's floating. And this is in France.
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is in Sapporo.
p98
aVIt's balancing on a shaft and a ball,
p99
aVright at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,
p100
aVwhich means that the lower half of the object
p101
aVis just a little bit more weighty.
p102
aVSo you can see it rotating here.
p103
aVIt weighs about a ton or over a ton.
p104
aVIt's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
p105
aVBut it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
p106
aVIt's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is another species of work that I do.
p109
aVThese are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,
p110
aVbut they have magnets horizontally in them
p111
aVthat make them all like compasses.
p112
aVSo all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.
p113
aVAnd the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.
p114
aVSo as you turn around you're seeing different colors.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is based on the structure of a diamond.
p117
aVIt was a diamond cell structure
p118
aVwas the point of departure.
p119
aVAnd then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows
p120
aVbetween the atoms.
p121
aVAnd so I placed one more element of each one of them.
p122
aVThese were white spheres.
p123
aVThen I had video projectors
p124
aVthat were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.
p125
aVSo they would catch parts of the images,
p126
aVand make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,
p127
aVas you walk through it, through the object.
p128
aa(lp129
VThis is something I did
p130
aVof a tactile communication system.
p131
aVIt was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,
p132
aVand then putting it into a communication system.
p133
aVThis is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,
p134
aVthat would be directed around the room
p135
aVby a computer.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is a clock I designed.
p138
aVIt has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.
p139
aVIt turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd then, this is like
p142
aVprojects that are harder to build.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVThis has a diamond-bottomed lake.
p145
aVSo it's a floating island
p146
aVwith water, fresh water,
p147
aVthat can fly from place to place.
p148
aVThis would be grown, I suppose,
p149
aVwith nanotechnology in the future sometime.
p150
aa(lp151
VIn the course of doing my work
p152
aVI sort of have a broad range of interests.
p153
aVAnd some of it is just the idea of creating media \u2014
p154
aVmedia as a sculpture,
p155
aVsomething that would keep the sculpture
p156
aVfresh and ever-changing,
p157
aVby just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.
p158
aVAnd I had a lot of \u2014
p159
aValways interested in the concept of a crystal ball.
p160
aVAnd the idea that you could see things
p161
aVinside of a crystal ball and predict the future \u2014
p162
aVor a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box
p163
aVwhere anything can appear.
p164
aVI had thought about, a long time ago,
p165
aVin the late '60s \u2014 when I was just starting out,
p166
aVI was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's
p167
aVgrand project for an electric globe
p168
aVacross from the United Nations \u2014
p169
aVand other things that were happening,
p170
aVthe space program at that time,
p171
aVand Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.
p172
aVI was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets
p173
aVthat could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo if we could roll the next film here.
p176
aVThis has evolved over the years
p177
aVin a lot of different iterations.
p178
aVBut this the current version of it,
p179
aVis a flying airship
p180
aVthat is about 35 meters in diameter,
p181
aVabout 110 feet in diameter.
p182
aVThe whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,
p183
aVred, blue, and green,
p184
aVthat allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.
p185
aa(lp186
VI came with a plan.
p187
aVI brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment
p188
aVto do a feasibility study,
p189
aVand they analyzed it,
p190
aVand came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.
p191
aVSo we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.
p192
aVThis is the control room inside of the ship.
p193
aVThe idea of this air genie is,
p194
aVit's something that can just transform and become anything.
p195
aVIt's like a traveling show.
p196
aVIt has speakers on it. And it has cameras
p197
aVover the surface of it.
p198
aVSo it can see its environment,
p199
aVand then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
p200
aVHere the legs are retracting.
p201
aVThe cabin is open or closed, as you like.
p202
aVIt weighs about 20 tons.
p203
aVIt has on-board generators.
p204
aVIt can generate about a million kilowatts,
p205
aVin order to be bright enough
p206
aVto be visible in daylight.
p207
aVThe idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.
p208
aVIt really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.
p209
aVThere would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,
p210
aVthat would allow the thing to become
p211
aVactually kind of a conscious object
p212
aVthat would respond to the moment,
p213
aVand to interact as an entity
p214
aVthat was aware, that could communicate.
p215
aVIt's completely silent and nonpolluting.
p216
aVIt has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.
p217
aVIt could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.
p218
aa(lp219
VPrimarily I would be interested in
p220
aVhow it would interact with, say,
p221
aVgoing to a college campus,
p222
aVand then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,
p223
aVthe world, the situation of the globe.
p224
aVThe default image on the object
p225
aVwould probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
p226
aVBut then one could interact with that
p227
aVand show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations \u2014
p228
aVall of the things that we're concerned with today.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd then at night the idea is that
p231
aVit would be used as kind of a rave situation,
p232
aVwhere the people could cut loose,
p233
aVand the music and the lights, and everything.
p234
aVSo it could land in a park, for example.
p235
aVOr this could represent a college green.
p236
aVAnd then it would have a corresponding website
p237
aVthat would show the itinerary of this.
p238
aVAnd so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
p239
aVIt would also be able to be an open code,
p240
aVso people could interact with it.
p241
aVIt would be forum for people's ideas about
p242
aVwhat they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.
p243
aVSo that's pretty much it.
p244
aVOkay. Thank you.
