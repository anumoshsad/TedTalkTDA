VBoth myself and my brother
p4
aVbelong to the under 30 demographic,
p5
aVwhich Pat said makes 70 percent,
p6
aVbut according to our statistics
p7
aVit makes 60 percent of the region's population.
p8
aVQatar is no exception to the region.
p9
aVIt's a very young nation led by young people.
p10
aVWe have been reminiscing about the latest technologies
p11
aVand the iPods,
p12
aVand for me the abaya,
p13
aVmy traditional dress that I'm wearing today.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow this is not a religious garment,
p16
aVnor is it a religious statement.
p17
aVInstead, it's a diverse cultural statement
p18
aVthat we choose to wear.
p19
aVNow I remember a few years ago,
p20
aVa journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,
p21
aVpresident of Qatar University \u2014
p22
aVwho, by the way, is a woman \u2014
p23
aVhe asked her whether she thought
p24
aVthe abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.
p25
aVHer answer was quite the contrary.
p26
aVInstead, she felt more free,
p27
aVmore free because she could wear whatever she wanted
p28
aVunder the abaya.
p29
aVShe could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVNot that you do; I'm just saying.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VMy point is here, people have a choice \u2014
p36
aVjust like the Indian lady could wear her sari
p37
aVor the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.
p38
aVWe are changing our culture from within,
p39
aVbut at the same time
p40
aVwe are reconnecting with our traditions.
p41
aVWe know that modernization is happening.
p42
aVAnd yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
p43
aVBut at the same time
p44
aVwe are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.
p45
aVIt's important for us to grow organically.
p46
aVAnd we continuously make the conscious decision
p47
aVto reach that balance.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn fact, research has shown
p50
aVthat the more the world is flat,
p51
aVif I use Tom Friedman's analogy,
p52
aVor global,
p53
aVthe more and more people are wanting to be different.
p54
aVAnd for us young people,
p55
aVthey're looking to become individuals
p56
aVand find their differences amongst themselves.
p57
aVWhich is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy
p58
aVof globalizing the local
p59
aVand localizing the global.
p60
aVWe don't want to be all the same,
p61
aVbut we want to respect each other and understand each other.
p62
aVAnd therefore tradition becomes more important,
p63
aVnot less important.
p64
aa(lp65
VLife necessitates a universal world,
p66
aVhowever, we believe in the security
p67
aVof having a local identity.
p68
aVAnd this is what the leaders of this region
p69
aVare trying to do.
p70
aVWe're trying to be part of this global village,
p71
aVbut at the same time we're revising ourselves
p72
aVthrough our cultural institutions and cultural development.
p73
aVI'm a representation of that phenomenon.
p74
aVAnd I think a lot of people in this room,
p75
aVI can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.
p76
aVAnd I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,
p77
aVthey are in the same position.
p78
aVWe're continuously trying to straddle
p79
aVdifferent worlds, different cultures
p80
aVand trying to meet the challenges
p81
aVof a different expectation
p82
aVfrom ourselves and from others.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo I want to ask a question:
p85
aVWhat should culture in the 21st century look like?
p86
aVIn a time where the world is becoming personalized,
p87
aVwhen the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,
p88
aVeverything has its own personal identity,
p89
aVhow should we perceive ourselves
p90
aVand how should we perceive others?
p91
aVHow does that impact our desert culture?
p92
aa(lp93
VI'm not sure of how many of you in Washington
p94
aVare aware of the cultural developments happening in the region
p95
aVand, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art
p96
aVopened in Qatar in 2008.
p97
aVI myself am personalizing these cultural developments,
p98
aVbut I also understand
p99
aVthat this has to be done organically.
p100
aVYes, we do have all the resources that we need
p101
aVin order to develop new cultural institutions,
p102
aVbut what I think is more important
p103
aVis that we are very fortunate
p104
aVto have visionary leaders
p105
aVwho understand that this can't happen from outside,
p106
aVit has to come from within.
p107
aVAnd guess what?
p108
aVYou might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf
p109
aVwho are leading these cultural initiatives
p110
aVhappen to be women.
p111
aa(lp112
VI want to ask you, why do you think this is?
p113
aVIs it because it's a soft option;
p114
aVwe have nothing else to do?
p115
aVNo, I don't think so.
p116
aVI think that women in this part of the world
p117
aVrealize that culture is an important component
p118
aVto connect people
p119
aVboth locally and regionally.
p120
aVIt's a natural component
p121
aVfor bringing people together, discussing ideas \u2014
p122
aVin the same way we're doing here at TED.
p123
aVWe're here, we're part of a community,
p124
aVsharing out ideas and discussing them.
p125
aVArt becomes a very important part
p126
aVof our national identity.
p127
aVThe existential and social and political impact
p128
aVan artist has
p129
aVon his nation's development of cultural identity
p130
aVis very important.
p131
aa(lp132
VYou know, art and culture is big business.
p133
aVAsk me.
p134
aVAsk the chairpersons and CEOs
p135
aVof Sotheby's and Christie's.
p136
aVAsk Charles Saatchi about great art.
p137
aVThey make a lot of money.
p138
aVSo I think women in our society
p139
aVare becoming leaders,
p140
aVbecause they realize
p141
aVthat for their future generations,
p142
aVit's very important
p143
aVto maintain our cultural identities.
p144
aVWhy else do Greeks demand the return
p145
aVof the Elgin Marbles?
p146
aVAnd why is there an uproar
p147
aVwhen a private collector tries to sell his collection
p148
aVto a foreign museum?
p149
aVWhy does it take me months on end
p150
aVto get an export license from London or New York
p151
aVin order to get pieces into my country?
p152
aa(lp153
VIn few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran
p154
aVwho's a very important artist for us
p155
aVwill be talking to you.
p156
aVShe lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.
p157
aVInstead, she tries to engage
p158
aVin a very important dialogue
p159
aVabout her culture, nation and heritage.
p160
aVShe does that through important visual forms
p161
aVof photography and film.
p162
aa(lp163
VIn the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums
p164
aVthrough an organic process from within.
p165
aVOur mission is of cultural integration and independence.
p166
aVWe don't want to have what there is in the West.
p167
aVWe don't want their collections.
p168
aVWe want to build our own identities, our own fabric,
p169
aVcreate an open dialogue
p170
aVso that we share our ideas
p171
aVand share yours with us.
p172
aVIn a few days,
p173
aVwe will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.
p174
aVWe have done extensive research
p175
aVto ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,
p176
aVand Arabs who are not Muslims \u2014
p177
aVnot all Arabs are Muslims, by the way \u2014
p178
aVbut we make sure that they are represented
p179
aVin this new institution.
p180
aVThis institution is government-backed
p181
aVand it has been the case
p182
aVfor the past three decades.
p183
aVWe will open the museum in a few days,
p184
aVand I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways
p185
aVand come and join us.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VNow this museum is just as important to us as the West.
p190
aVSome of you might have heard
p191
aVof the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,
p192
aVbut I doubt a lot of people know
p193
aVthat this artist worked in Picasso's studio
p194
aVin Paris in the 1930s.
p195
aVFor me it was a new discovery.
p196
aVAnd I think with time, in the years to come
p197
aVwe'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,
p198
aVour Legers and our Cezannes.
p199
aVWe do have artists,
p200
aVbut unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow visual expression is just one form
p203
aVof culture integration.
p204
aVWe have realized that recently
p205
aVmore and more people
p206
aVare using the means of YouTube and social networking
p207
aVto express their stories, share their photos
p208
aVand tell their own stories through their own voices.
p209
aVIn a similar way,
p210
aVwe have created the Doha Film Institute.
p211
aVNow the Doha Film Institute is an organization
p212
aVto teach people about film and filmmaking.
p213
aVLast year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.
p214
aVToday I am proud to say
p215
aVwe have trained and educated
p216
aVover 66 Qatari women filmmakers
p217
aVto edit, tell their own stories
p218
aVin their own voices.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VNow if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film
p223
aVthat has proven to show
p224
aVthat a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku
p225
aVin telling a big picture.
p226
aVAnd this is one of our filmmakers' products.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?
p229
aVWho are you playing?
p230
aVGirl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
p231
aVKhaled: Why would I want to put it on?
p232
aVGirl: Do as you're told, young girl.
p233
aVBoy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)
p234
aVPlay by yourself then.
p235
aVGirl: Women! One word and they get upset.
p236
aVUseless.
p237
aVThank you. Thank you!
p238

aa(lp241
VSM: Going back to straddling between East and West,
p242
aVlast month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p243
aVhere in Doha.
p244
aVThe Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p245
aVwas held at our new cultural hub, Katara.
p246
aVIt attracted 42,000 people,
p247
aVand we showcased 51 films.
p248
aVNow the Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p249
aVis not an imported festival,
p250
aVbut rather an important festival
p251
aVbetween the cities of New York and Doha.
p252
aVIt's important for two things.
p253
aVFirst, it allows us to showcase
p254
aVour Arab filmmakers and voices
p255
aVto one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,
p256
aVNew York City.
p257
aVAt the same time, we are inviting them
p258
aVto come and explore our part of the world.
p259
aVThey're learning our culture, our language, our heritage
p260
aVand realizing we're just as different
p261
aVand just the same as each other.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow over and over again,
p264
aVpeople have said, "Let's build bridges,"
p265
aVand frankly, I want to do more than that.
p266
aVI would like break the walls of ignorance
p267
aVbetween East and West \u2014
p268
aVno, not the soft option that we have discussed before,
p269
aVbut rather the soft power
p270
aVthat Joseph Nye has spoken about before.
p271
aVCulture's a very important tool to bring people together.
p272
aVWe should not underestimate it.
p273
aa(lp274
V"Know thyself,"
p275
aVthat is the journey of self-expression and self-realization
p276
aVthat we are traveling.
p277
aVNow I don't pretend to have all the answers,
p278
aVbut I know that me as an individual
p279
aVand we as a nation
p280
aVwelcome this community
p281
aVof ideas worth spreading.
p282
aVThis is a very interesting journey.
p283
aVI welcome you on board
p284
aVfor us to engage and discuss new ideas
p285
aVof how to bring people together
p286
aVthrough cultural initiatives and discussions.
p287
aVFamiliarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.
p288
aa(lp289
