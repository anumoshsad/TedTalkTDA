VI'm going to show you how terrorism
p4
aVactually interacts with our daily life.
p5
aV15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.
p6
aVAt the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners
p7
aVin Italian jails.
p8
aVHe asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.
p9
aVNow, as many of you may remember,
p10
aVthe Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization
p11
aVwhich was very active in Italy
p12
aVfrom the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
p13
aVAs part of their strategy
p14
aVthe Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.
p15
aVThey sat in silence through their trails,
p16
aVwaving occasionally at family and friends.
p17
aa(lp18
VIn 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.
p19
aVAnd they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,
p20
aVand tell their story.
p21
aVAnd I was one of those people.
p22
aVWhen I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,
p23
aVhe said that the female members of the organization
p24
aVhad actually supported my name.
p25
aVIn particular, one person had put it forward.
p26
aVShe was my childhood friend.
p27
aVShe had joined the Red Brigades
p28
aVand became a leader of the organization.
p29
aa(lp30
VNaturally, I didn't know that
p31
aVuntil the day she was arrested.
p32
aVIn fact, I read it in the newspaper.
p33
aVAt the time of the phone call
p34
aVI just had a baby,
p35
aVI successfully completed a management buyout
p36
aVto the company I was working with,
p37
aVand the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home
p38
aVand touring the high-security prisons.
p39
aVBut this is exactly what I did
p40
aVbecause I wanted to know
p41
aVwhat had turned my best friend
p42
aVinto a terrorist,
p43
aVand why she'd never tried to recruit me.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aV(Applause)
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, this is exactly what I did.
p48
aVNow, I found the answer very quickly.
p49
aVI actually had failed
p50
aVthe psychological profiling of a terrorist.
p51
aVThe center committee of the Red Brigades
p52
aVhad judged me too single-minded
p53
aVand too opinionated to become a good terrorist.
p54
aVMy friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist
p55
aVbecause she was very good at following orders.
p56
aVShe also embraced violence.
p57
aVBecause she believed that the only way
p58
aVto unblock what, at the time,
p59
aVwas known as a blocked democracy,
p60
aVItaly, a country run by the same party for 35 years
p61
aVwas the arms struggle.
p62
aa(lp63
VAt the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
p64
aVI also discovered that their life was not ruled
p65
aVby politics or ideology,
p66
aVbut actually was ruled by economics.
p67
aVThey were constantly short of cash.
p68
aVThey were constantly searching for cash.
p69
aVNow, contrary to what many people believe,
p70
aVterrorism is actually a very expensive business.
p71
aVI'll give you an idea.
p72
aVIn the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades
p73
aVon a yearly basis
p74
aVwas seven million dollars.
p75
aVThis is roughly between 100
p76
aVand 150 million, today.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, you know, if you live underground
p79
aVit's really hard to produce this amount of money.
p80
aVBut this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
p81
aVand then, later on, other arms organizations,
p82
aVincluding members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,
p83
aVeverybody was extremely reluctant
p84
aVto talk about ideology, or politics.
p85
aVBecause they had no idea.
p86
aVThe political vision of a terrorist organization
p87
aVis decided by the leadership,
p88
aVwhich, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
p89
aVAll the others do, day in and day out,
p90
aVis search for money.
p91
aa(lp92
VOnce, for example, I was interviewing
p93
aVthis part-timer from the Red Brigades.
p94
aVIt was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
p95
aVHe was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.
p96
aVAnd he told me that the best time of his life
p97
aVwas when he was a member of the Red Brigades
p98
aVand he went sailing, every summer, back and forth
p99
aVfrom Lebanon, where he would pick up
p100
aVSoviet weapons from the PLO,
p101
aVand then carry them all the way to Sardinia
p102
aVwhere the other arms organization from Europe would go
p103
aVand take their share of the arms.
p104
aVFor that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,
p105
aVwhich went to fund their organization.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, because I am a trained economist
p108
aVand I think in economic terms,
p109
aVall of the sudden I thought,
p110
aVmaybe there is something here.
p111
aVMaybe there is a link, a commercial link,
p112
aVbetween one organization and another one.
p113
aVBut it was only when I interviewed
p114
aVMario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,
p115
aVthe man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,
p116
aVItalian former prime minister,
p117
aVthat I finally realized
p118
aVthat terrorism is actually business.
p119
aVI was having lunch with him
p120
aVin a high-security prison in Italy.
p121
aVAnd as we were eating,
p122
aVI had the distinct feeling
p123
aVthat I was back in the city of London,
p124
aVhaving lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
p125
aVThis guy thought in the same way I did.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.
p128
aVNaturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
p129
aVIn fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
p130
aVYou know, that woman that goes around to foundations
p131
aVasking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
p132
aVSo, in the end, I took a decision
p133
aVthat, in retrospect, did change my life.
p134
aVI sold my company,
p135
aVand funded the research myself.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd what I discovered
p138
aVis this parallel reality,
p139
aVanother international economic system,
p140
aVwhich runs parallel to our own,
p141
aVwhich has been created by arms organizations
p142
aVsince the end of World War II.
p143
aVAnd what is even more shocking
p144
aVis that this system
p145
aVhas followed, step by step, the evolution
p146
aVof our own system,
p147
aVof our Western capitalism.
p148
aVAnd there are three main stages.
p149
aVThe first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe second one is the privatization of terrorism.
p152
aVAnd the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.
p153
aVSo, state sponsor of terrorism,
p154
aVfeature of the Cold War.
p155
aVThis is when the two superpowers were fighting
p156
aVa war by proxy,
p157
aValong the periphery of the sphere of influence,
p158
aVfully funding arms organizations.
p159
aVA mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
p160
aVSo, the link between crime and terror
p161
aVis established very early on.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd here is the best example,
p164
aVthe Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,
p165
aVlegally funded by the U.S. Congress,
p166
aVillegally funded by the Reagan administration
p167
aVvia covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
p168
aVThen comes the late 1970s, early '80s,
p169
aVand some groups successfully carry out
p170
aVthe privatization of terrorism.
p171
aVSo, they gain independence from the sponsor,
p172
aVand start funding themselves.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.
p175
aVSo, Arafat used to get a percentage
p176
aVof the smuggling of hashish
p177
aVfrom Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.
p178
aVAnd the IRA, which control the private transportation system
p179
aVin Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
p180
aVSo, every single time
p181
aVthat somebody got into a taxi in Belfast
p182
aVwithout knowing, actually,
p183
aVwas funding the IRA.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut the great change came, of course,
p186
aVwith globalization and deregulation.
p187
aVThis is when arms organization were able to link up,
p188
aValso financially, with each other.
p189
aVBut above all, they started to do
p190
aVserious business with the world of crime.
p191
aVAnd together they money-laundered
p192
aVtheir dirty business through the same channel.
p193
aVThis is when we see the birth of the transnational
p194
aVarms organization Al Qaeda.
p195
aVThis is an organization that can raise money across border.
p196
aVBut also that is able to carry out attacks
p197
aVin more than one country.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, deregulation also brought back
p200
aVrogue economics.
p201
aVSo what is rogue economics?
p202
aVRogue economics is a force which is constantly
p203
aVlurking in the background of history.
p204
aVIt comes back at times of great transformation,
p205
aVglobalization being one of those transformations.
p206
aVIt is at this times in which
p207
aVpolitics actually loses control of the economy,
p208
aVand the economy becomes a rogue force
p209
aVworking against us.
p210
aVIt has happened before in history.
p211
aVIt has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
p212
aVIt has happened with Industrial Revolution.
p213
aVAnd it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, I calculated how big was this international
p216
aVeconomic system composed by crime,
p217
aVterror, and illegal economy,
p218
aVbefore 9-11.
p219
aVAnd it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
p220
aVIt is trillions, it's not billions.
p221
aVThis is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,
p222
aVsoon will be more,
p223
aVconsidering where this country is going.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, until 9-11,
p227
aVthe bulk of all this money
p228
aVflew into the U.S. economy
p229
aVbecause the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars
p230
aVand the money laundering was taking place
p231
aVinside the United States.
p232
aVThe entry point, of course, of most of this money
p233
aVwere the off-shore facilities.
p234
aVSo, this was a vital injection of cash
p235
aVinto the U.S. economy.
p236
aVNow, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,
p237
aVthe U.S. money supply is the amount
p238
aVof dollars that the Federal Reserve
p239
aVprints every year
p240
aVin order to satisfy
p241
aVthe increase in the demand for dollars,
p242
aVwhich, of course, reflects the growth
p243
aVof the economy.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s
p246
aVa growing number of these dollars
p247
aVwas actually leaving the United States,
p248
aVnever to come back.
p249
aVThese were money taken out
p250
aVin suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
p251
aVThese were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.
p252
aVThese were money taken out to fund
p253
aVthe growth of the terror,
p254
aVillegal and criminal economy.
p255
aVSo, you see, what is the relationship?
p256
aa(lp257
VThe United States actually is a country
p258
aVthat is the reserve currency of the world.
p259
aVWhat does it mean? That means that
p260
aVit has a privilege that other countries do not have.
p261
aVIt can borrow against the total amount of dollars
p262
aVin circulation in the world.
p263
aVThis privilege is called seigniorage.
p264
aVNo other country can do that.
p265
aVAll the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,
p266
aVcan borrow only against the amount of money
p267
aVin circulation inside its own borders.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo, here is the implication of the relationship
p270
aVbetween the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.
p271
aVThe U.S. in the 1990s
p272
aVwas borrowing against the growth
p273
aVof the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
p274
aVThis is how close we are with this world.
p275
aVNow, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,
p276
aVbecause George Bush launched the War on Terror.
p277
aVPart of the War on Terror
p278
aVwas the introduction of the Patriot Act.
p279
aVNow, many of you know that the Patriot Act
p280
aVis a legislation that greatly reduces
p281
aVthe liberties of Americans in order to protect them
p282
aVagainst terrorism.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut there is a section of the Patriot Act
p285
aVwhich refers specifically to finance.
p286
aVAnd it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.
p287
aVWhat the Patriot Act did was
p288
aVto prohibit U.S. bank,
p289
aVand U.S.-registered foreign banks
p290
aVfrom doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
p291
aVIt closed that door between the money laundering
p292
aVin dollars, and the U.S. economy.
p293
aVIt also gave the U.S. monetary authorities
p294
aVthe right to monitor any dollar transaction
p295
aVtaking place anywhere in the world.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international
p298
aVfinance and banking.
p299
aVAll the bankers said to their clients,
p300
aV"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."
p301
aVNow, the Euro was a newly born currency
p302
aVof great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.
p303
aVAnd this is what people did.
p304
aVNobody wants the U.S. monetary authority
p305
aVto check their relationship,
p306
aVto monitor their relationship with their clientele.
p307
aVThe same thing happened, of course,
p308
aVin the world of crime and terror.
p309
aVPeople simply moved their money-laundering activities
p310
aVaway from the United States
p311
aVinto Europe.
p312
aa(lp313
VWhy did this happen? This happened because
p314
aVthe Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
p315
aVIt was introduced only in the United States.
p316
aVAnd it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
p317
aVIn Europe, a similar legislation
p318
aVwas not introduced.
p319
aVSo, within six months
p320
aVEurope became the epicenter
p321
aVof the money-laundering activities
p322
aVof the world.
p323
aVSo, this is how incredible are the relationship
p324
aVbetween the world of crime
p325
aVand the world of terror,
p326
aVand our own life.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo, why did I tell you this story?
p329
aVI told you this story because you
p330
aVmust understand that there is a world
p331
aVthat goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,
p332
aVincluding the personal relationship that you have
p333
aVwith friends and family.
p334
aVYou got to question everything that is told to you,
p335
aVincluding what I just told you today.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aVThis is the only way for you
p338
aVto step into the dark side, and have a look at it.
p339
aVAnd believe me,
p340
aVit's going to be scary.
p341
aVIt's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.
p342
aVAnd, above all, it's not going to be boring.
