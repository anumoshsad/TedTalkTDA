VI'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society,
p4
aVpublisher of "Skeptic" magazine.
p5
aVWe investigate claims of the paranormal,
p6
aVpseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between,
p7
aVscience and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science,
p8
aVvoodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science,
p9
aVand plain old non-sense.
p10
aVAnd unless you've been on Mars recently,
p11
aVyou know there's a lot of that out there.
p12
aa(lp13
VSome people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.
p14
aVBut let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.
p15
aVWe are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there \u2014
p16
aVwell, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
Vtrying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'll show you an example of a bad idea.
p23
aVI brought this with me,
p24
aVthis was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
p25
aVIt's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
p26
aVIt's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VThis was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.
p31
aVIt's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
p32
aVYou could dowse for all sorts of things,
p33
aVbut this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana
p34
aVin students' lockers.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo the way it works is you go down the hallway,
p39
aVand you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,
p40
aVand then you open the locker.
p41
aVSo it looks something like this.
p42
aVI'll show you.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VWell, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.
p47
aVWell, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.
p48
aVIt'll go this way for sure.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?
p57
aVAnd the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VBut in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.
p64
aVAnd that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here:
p65
aVThis is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.
p66
aVPeople remember the hits and forget the misses.
p67
aVIn science, we keep the whole database,
p68
aVand look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out
p69
aVfrom the total number you'd expect by chance.
p70
aa(lp71
VIn this case, we tested it.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe had two opaque boxes:
p74
aVone with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.
p75
aVAnd it got it 50 percent of the time \u2014
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
Vwhich is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.
p80
aVSo that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.
p81
aa(lp82
V"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme.
p83
aVThis one is on the future of intelligence.
p84
aVAre people getting smarter or dumber?
p85
aVI have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in,
p86
aVbut in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.
p87
aVThree IQ points per 10 years, going up.
p88
aVSort of an interesting thing.
p89
aa(lp90
VWith science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.
p91
aVAre science and religion compatible?
p92
aVIt's like, are science and plumbing compatible?
p93
aVThey're just two different things.
p94
aVScience is not a thing. It's a verb.
p95
aVIt's a way of thinking about things.
p96
aVIt's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
p97
aa(lp98
VI mean, what's more likely:
p99
aVthat extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings
p100
aVtravel across vast distances of interstellar space
p101
aVto leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas
p102
aVto promote skeptic.com, our web page?
p103
aVOr is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
p104
aVAnd in all cases we have to ask \u2014
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat's the more likely explanation?
p109
aVBefore we say something is out of this world,
p110
aVwe should first make sure that it's not in this world.
p111
aVWhat's more likely:
p112
aVthat Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship,
p113
aVor that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VThe same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.
p118
aVFor those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.
p119
aVI think you need to be more explicit here in step two."
p120
aVThis single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments.
p121
aVThere's nothing more to it than that.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
VYou can say a miracle occurs,
p126
aVit's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.
p127
aVThere's nothing to test.
p128
aVIt's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers \u2014
p131
aVdark energy or dark matter, something like that \u2014
p132
aVuntil we figure out what it is, we'll call it this.
p133
aVIt's the beginning of the causal chain for science.
p134
aVFor intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.
p135
aVSo again, we can ask this: what's more likely?
p136
aVAre UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California,
p139
aVlooking down over Pasadena.
p140
aVAnd if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.
p141
aVYou don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment,
p142
aVyou don't need computers.
p143
aVThis was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.
p144
aVYou just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.
p145
aVCamera's ready \u2014 that's it.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VSo, although it's possible that most of these things are fake
p150
aVor illusions or so on, and that some of them are real,
p151
aVit's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.
p152
aa(lp153
VOn a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance
p154
aVbetween data and theory.
p155
aVIn the case of Galileo, he had two problems
p156
aVwhen he turned his telescope to Saturn.
p157
aVFirst of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.
p158
aVSecond of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy,
p159
aVand he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.
p160
aVSo he wrote that he had seen \u2014
p161
aV"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."
p162
aVAnd this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
p163
aVSo without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data,
p164
aVyou can't have a good theory.
p165
aVIt wasn't solved until 1655.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes
p168
aVpeople made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
p169
aVIt wasn't till Huygens had two things:
p170
aVHe had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated,
p171
aVand he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data
p172
aVin which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster \u2014
p173
aVaccording to Kepler's Laws \u2014 than Saturn, then we catch up with it.
p174
aVAnd we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.
p175
aVAnd that, in fact, turns out to be true.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.
p178
aVSo one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things
p179
aVis that we have things, on a simple level,
p180
aVand then I'll go to more serious ones.
p181
aVLike, we have a tendency to see faces.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is the face on Mars.
p184
aVIn 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area
p185
aVbecause people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.
p186
aVHere's the close-up of it from 2001.
p187
aVIf you squint, you can still see the face.
p188
aVAnd when you're squinting,
p189
aVyou're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain,
p190
aVso you're reducing the quality of your data.
p191
aVAnd if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face,
p192
aVbecause we're programmed by evolution to see faces.
p193
aa(lp194
VFaces are important for us socially.
p195
aVAnd of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.
p196
aVYou see the happy face on Mars, there.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VIf astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.
p201
aVDo you see him there? Little froggy legs.
p202
aVOr if geologists were elephants?
p203
aa(lp204
VReligious iconography.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VDiscovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.
p209
aVHe charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun
p210
aVtill he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
p211
aVHere's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,
p212
aVor is it up the street from here?
p213
aVTree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy,
p214
aVblack-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking \u2014
p215
aVhumans are pattern-seeking animals.
p216
aa(lp217
VHere's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
p218
aVHere's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich \u2014
p219
aVwhich I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino \u2014
p220
aVof course, this being America.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VThis casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VBut who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VIt has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.
p233
aa(lp234
VVirgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
p235
aVI actually went to see this one.
p236
aVThere was a lot of people there.
p237
aVThe faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.
p238
aVWe went down and investigated.
p239
aVJust to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi,
p240
aVnext to this two, two and a half story-sized image.
p241
aVAll these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.
p242
aVSo we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.
p243
aVIt turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree,
p244
aVyou get the effect.
p245
aVHere's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
p246
aVI guess you can only have one miracle per building.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VSo is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd now I'm going to finish up with another example of this,
p255
aVwith auditory illusions.
p256
aVThere's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton,
p257
aVabout the dead talking back to us.
p258
aVBy the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.
p259
aVAnybody can do it, turns out.
p260
aVIt's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VIn this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.
p265
aVThere's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff.
p266
aVThis is the most famous one of all of these.
p267
aVHere's the forward version of the very famous song.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Music with lyrics)
p270
aa(lp271
VIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now.
p272
aVIt's just a spring clean for the May Queen.
p273
aVYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run,
p274
aVThere's still time to change the road you're on.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Music ends)
p277
aa(lp278
VCouldn't you just listen to that all day?
p279
aa(lp280
VAll right, here it is backwards,
p281
aVand see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Music with unintelligible lyrics)
p284
aa(lp285
V(Lyrics) Satan!
p286
aa(lp287
V(Unintelligible lyrics continue)
p288
aa(lp289
VWhat did you get? Audience: Satan!
p290
aa(lp291
VSatan. OK, at least we got "Satan".
p292
aVNow, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain
p293
aVto tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Music with lyrics)
p296
aa(lp297
V(Music ends)
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VYou can't miss it when I tell you what's there.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VI'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story.
p308
aVThe Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
p309
aVWe're always looking for little good things that people do.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd in England, there's a pop singer.
p312
aVOne of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
p313
aVAnd she wrote a beautiful song.
p314
aVIt was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
p315
aVIt's a love story \u2014 she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK \u2014
p316
aVabout how she much loves her guy,
p317
aVand compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
p318
aVAnd she has this one passage here.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Music)
p321
aa(lp322
V(Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge
p323
aa(lp324
VThat's a guess,
p325
aa(lp326
VNo one can ever say it's true,
p327
aa(lp328
VBut I know that I will always be with you.
p329
aa(lp330
VMichael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close.
p331
aVIn America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge."
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VBut my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator,
p336
aVwho wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on,
p337
aVuses every chance he gets to promote good science.
p338
aVAnd so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,
p339
aVin which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.
p340
aVYou know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.
p341
aVWe know within precise error bars how close it is.
p342
aVSo we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said,
p345
aV"I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club.
p346
aVI should've known better."
p347
aVAnd she re-cut the song.
p348
aVSo I will end with the new version.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Music with lyrics)
p351
aa(lp352
VWe are 13.7 billion light years
p353
aVfrom the edge of the observable universe.
p354
aVThat's a good estimate with well-defined error bars.
p355
aVAnd with the available information,
p356
aVI predict that I will always be with you.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VHow cool is that?
