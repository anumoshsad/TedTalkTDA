VI was sitting with my girls,
p4
aVand Joy said,
p5
aV"Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.
p6
aVMy daddy, he calls me all the time."
p7
aa(lp8
V"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.
p9
aV"I haven't heard from my dad in years."
p10
aa(lp11
VAt this moment, I knew the girls needed a way
p12
aVto connect with their fathers.
p13
aVAt Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,
p14
aVwe have these types of conversations all the time
p15
aVas a way to help girls of African descent
p16
aVprepare for their passage into womanhood.
p17
aVThese girls just needed
p18
aVa way to invite their fathers into their lives
p19
aVon their own terms.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I asked the girls,
p22
aV"How can we help other girls
p23
aVdevelop healthy relationships with their fathers?"
p24
aa(lp25
V"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted,
p26
aVand all the girls quickly backed her up.
p27
aVThey started dreaming about the decorations,
p28
aVinvitations, the dresses they were going to wear,
p29
aVand what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)
p30
aVIt was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,
p31
aVbut even if I could have slowed down those girls,
p32
aVI wouldn't have,
p33
aVbecause one thing that I have learned
p34
aVfrom over a decade of working with girls
p35
aVis that they already know what they need.
p36
aVThe wisdom lives inside of them.
p37
aVAs long as they have infrastructure,
p38
aVmentorship and resources,
p39
aVthey can build what they need,
p40
aVnot only to survive, but to thrive.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo we had a dance,
p43
aVand girls and their fathers came in multitudes.
p44
aVThey were dressed to the nines.
p45
aVThey acted sweet.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVThey acted silly.
p48
aVThey really enjoyed each other's company.
p49
aVIt was a huge success.
p50
aVAnd the girls decided to make it an annual event.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo as the seasons changed,
p53
aVand it was time to plan the dance again,
p54
aVone girl named Brianna spoke up,
p55
aVand she said,
p56
aV"My dad can't come to the dance,
p57
aVand this whole thing is making me sad."
p58
aa(lp59
V"Why not?" the girls asked.
p60
aa(lp61
V"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.
p62
aa(lp63
V"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
V"And come in shackles?
p66
aVThat's worse than not having him here at all."
p67
aa(lp68
VAt this moment, I saw an opportunity
p69
aVfor the girls to rise to the occasion
p70
aVand to become their own heroes.
p71
aVSo I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?
p72
aVWe want every girl to experience the dance, right?"
p73
aa(lp74
VSo the girls thought for a moment,
p75
aVand one girl suggested,
p76
aV"Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"
p77
aa(lp78
VMost of the girls doubted the possibility of that,
p79
aVand said, "Are you crazy?
p80
aVWho is going to allow a bunch of little girls,
p81
aVdressed up \u2014 " (Laughter)
p82
aV" \u2014 to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"
p83
aVBecause that's what they called them.
p84
aa(lp85
VI said, "Girls, well, well,
p86
aVyou never know unless you ask."
p87
aa(lp88
VSo a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,
p89
aVsigned collectively by each girl,
p90
aVand I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.
p91
aVHe contacted me immediately and said,
p92
aVwhenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,
p93
aVhis doors are always open.
p94
aVBecause one thing he did know,
p95
aVthat when fathers are connected to their children,
p96
aVit is less likely that they will return.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo,
p99
aV16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.
p100
aVThe girls were dressed in their Sunday best,
p101
aVand the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits
p102
aVfor shirts and ties.
p103
aVThey hugged.
p104
aVThey shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.
p105
aVThey laughed together.
p106
aVIt was beautiful.
p107
aVThe fathers and daughters even experienced
p108
aVan opportunity to have a physical connection,
p109
aVsomething that a lot of them didn't even have
p110
aVfor a while.
p111
aVFathers were in a space where they were able to
p112
aVmake their daughters play,
p113
aVand pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.
p114
aVEven the guards cried.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut after the dance,
p117
aVwe all realized that Dad still would be in jail.
p118
aVSo we needed to create something
p119
aVthat they could take with them.
p120
aVSo we brought in Flip cams,
p121
aVand we had them look at the Flip cams
p122
aVand just interview each other \u2014
p123
aVtheir messages, their thoughts.
p124
aVThis was going to be used as a touchstone
p125
aVso when they started to miss each other
p126
aVand feel disconnected,
p127
aVthey could reconnect through this image.
p128
aa(lp129
VI'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes
p130
aVwith that camera and said,
p131
aV"Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"
p132
aVBecause our daddies are our mirrors
p133
aVthat we reflect back on
p134
aVwhen we decide about what type of man we deserve,
p135
aVand how they see us for the rest of our lives.
p136
aVI know that very well,
p137
aVbecause I was one of the lucky girls.
p138
aVI have had
p139
aVmy father in my life always.
p140
aVHe's even here today.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd that is why it is extremely special
p145
aVfor me to make sure that these girls
p146
aVare connected to their fathers,
p147
aVespecially those who are separated
p148
aVbecause of barbed wires and metal doors.
p149
aVWe have just created a form
p150
aVfor girls who have heavy questions on their heart
p151
aVto be in a position to ask their fathers those questions
p152
aVand given the fathers the freedom to answer.
p153
aVBecause we know that the fathers
p154
aVare even leaving with this one thought:
p155
aVWhat type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?
p156
aVBecause a father is locked in
p157
aVdoes not mean he should be locked out
p158
aVof his daughter's life.
