VIn Africa we say,
p4
aV"God gave the white man a watch
p5
aVand gave the black man time."
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVI think, how is it possible
p8
aVfor a man with so much time
p9
aVto tell his story in 18 minutes?
p10
aVI think it will be quite a challenge for me.
p11
aa(lp12
VMost African stories these days,
p13
aVthey talk about famine,
p14
aVHIV and AIDS,
p15
aVpoverty or war.
p16
aVBut my story that I would like to share with you today
p17
aVis the one about success.
p18
aVIt is about a country
p19
aVin the southwest of Africa
p20
aVcalled Namibia.
p21
aVNamibia has got 2.1 million people,
p22
aVbut it is only twice the size of California.
p23
aa(lp24
VI come from a region
p25
aVin the remote northwest part of the country.
p26
aVIt's called Kunene region.
p27
aVAnd in the center of Kunene region
p28
aVis the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.
p29
aVThis is where I'm coming from.
p30
aVMost people that are following the story
p31
aVof Angelina Jolie
p32
aVand Brad Pitt
p33
aVwill know where Namibia is.
p34
aVThey love Namibia
p35
aVfor its beautiful dunes,
p36
aVthat are even taller
p37
aVthan the Empire State Building.
p38
aVWind and time have twisted our landscape
p39
aVinto very strange shapes,
p40
aVand these shapes are speckled with wildlife
p41
aVthat has become so adapted
p42
aVto this harsh and strange land.
p43
aa(lp44
VI'm a Himba.
p45
aVYou might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?
p46
aVI'm a Himba and Namibian.
p47
aVA Himba is one of the 29
p48
aVethnic groups in Namibia.
p49
aVWe live a very traditional lifestyle.
p50
aVI grew up herding,
p51
aVlooking after our livestock \u2014
p52
aVgoats, sheep and cattle.
p53
aVAnd one day,
p54
aVmy father actually took me into the bush.
p55
aVHe said, "John,
p56
aVI want you to become a good herder.
p57
aVBoy, if you are looking after our livestock
p58
aVand you see a cheetah
p59
aVeating our goat \u2014
p60
aVcheetah is very nervous \u2014
p61
aVjust walk up to it.
p62
aVWalk up to it and smack it on the backside."
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aV"And he will let go of the goat
p65
aVand run off."
p66
aVBut then he said,
p67
aV"Boy, if you run into a lion,
p68
aVdon't move.
p69
aVDon't move. Stand your ground.
p70
aVPuff up and just look it in the eye
p71
aVand it may not want to fight you."
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVBut then, he said,
p74
aV"If you see a leopard,
p75
aVboy, you better run like hell."
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aV"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."
p78
aVIn this way \u2014
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVIn this way, I actually started to learn about nature.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn addition to being an ordinary Namibian
p83
aVand in addition to being a Himba
p84
aVI'm also a trained conservationist.
p85
aVAnd it is very important if you are in the field
p86
aVto know what to confront
p87
aVand what to run from.
p88
aVI was born in 1971.
p89
aVWe lived under apartheid regime.
p90
aVThe whites could farm, graze
p91
aVand hunt as they wished,
p92
aVbut we black, we were not regarded as responsible
p93
aVto use wildlife.
p94
aVWhenever we tried to hunt,
p95
aVwe were called poachers.
p96
aVAnd as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.
p97
aa(lp98
VBetween 1966 and 1990,
p99
aVthe U.S. and Soviet interests
p100
aVfought for control over my country.
p101
aVAnd you know, during war time,
p102
aVthere are militaries, armies, that are moving around.
p103
aVAnd the army hunted for valuable rhino horns
p104
aVand tusks.
p105
aVThey could sell these things for anything between
p106
aV$5,000 a kilo.
p107
aVDuring the same year
p108
aValmost every Himba had a rifle.
p109
aVBecause it was wartime,
p110
aVthe British .303 rifle
p111
aVwas just all over the whole country.
p112
aa(lp113
VThen in the same time, around 1980,
p114
aVwe had a very big drought.
p115
aVIt killed almost everything that was left.
p116
aVOur livestock was
p117
aValmost at the brink of extinction,
p118
aVprotected as well.
p119
aVWe were hungry.
p120
aVI remember a night
p121
aVwhen a hungry leopard
p122
aVwent into the house
p123
aVof one of our neighbors
p124
aVand took a sleeping child out of the bed.
p125
aVIt's a very sad story.
p126
aVBut even today,
p127
aVthat memory is still in people's minds.
p128
aVThey can pinpoint the exact location
p129
aVwhere this all happened.
p130
aVAnd then, in the same year,
p131
aVwe almost lost everything.
p132
aVAnd my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"
p133
aVAnd they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd the year I went to school,
p136
aVmy father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization
p137
aVcalled IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.
p138
aVThey actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.
p139
aVThey were trusted by the local communities
p140
aVlike our leader, Joshua Kangombe.
p141
aVJoshua Kangombe saw what was happening:
p142
aVwildlife disappearing,
p143
aVpoaching was skyrocketing,
p144
aVand the situation seemed very hopeless.
p145
aVDeath and despair surrounded Joshua
p146
aVand our entire communities.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:
p149
aVWhat if we pay people that you trust
p150
aVto look after wildlife?
p151
aVDo you have anybody in your communities, or people,
p152
aVthat know the bush very well
p153
aVand that know wildlife very well?
p154
aVThe headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."
p155
aV"Eh? The poachers?"
p156
aV"Yes. Our poachers."
p157
aVAnd that was my father.
p158
aVMy father has been a poacher for quite a long time.
p159
aVInstead of shooting poachers dead
p160
aVlike they were doing elsewhere in Africa,
p161
aVIRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities
p162
aVto manage their peoples
p163
aVand their rights to own and manage wildlife.
p164
aVAnd thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,
p165
aVwildlife numbers started coming back,
p166
aVand that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.
p167
aVWith independence, the whole approach of community getting involved
p168
aVwas embraced by our new government.
p169
aa(lp170
VThree things that actually help to build on this foundation:
p171
aVThe very first one is
p172
aVhonoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.
p173
aVHere is our tradition:
p174
aVAt every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.
p175
aVAnd at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors
p176
aVspeak through the headman
p177
aVand advise us where to get water,
p178
aVwhere to get grazings,
p179
aVand where to go and hunt.
p180
aVAnd I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves
p181
aVon the environment.
p182
aVAnd here are the new ideas.
p183
aVTransporting rhinos using helicopters
p184
aVI think is much easier
p185
aVthan talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?
p186
aVAnd these things we were taught by outsiders.
p187
aVWe learned these things from outsiders.
p188
aVWe needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;
p189
aVwe needed to learn more things like GPS
p190
aVjust to see whether \u2014
p191
aVcan GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land
p192
aVor is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?
p193
aVAnd we then wanted to see whether we can match our
p194
aVancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.
p195
aVAnd through this,
p196
aVwe actually started realizing our dreams,
p197
aVand we maintained honoring our traditions
p198
aVbut we were still open to new ideas.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe second element is that we wanted to have a life,
p201
aVa better life where we can benefit through many things.
p202
aVMost poachers, like my father,
p203
aVwere people from our own community.
p204
aVThey were not people from outside.
p205
aVThese were our own people.
p206
aVAnd sometimes, once they were caught,
p207
aVthey were treated with respect, brought back into the communities
p208
aVand they were made part of the bigger dreams.
p209
aVThe best one, like my father \u2014 I'm not campaigning for my father \u2014
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVthey were put in charge to stop others from poaching.
p212
aVAnd when this thing started going on,
p213
aVwe started becoming one community,
p214
aVrenewing our connection to nature.
p215
aVAnd that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe last element that actually helped develop these things
p218
aVwas the partnerships.
p219
aVOur government has given legal status over our traditional lands.
p220
aVThe other partners that we have got
p221
aVis business communities.
p222
aVBusiness communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map
p223
aVand they have also helped make wildlife
p224
aVa very valuable land use like any other land uses
p225
aVsuch as agriculture.
p226
aVAnd most of my conservation colleagues today
p227
aVthat you find in Namibia
p228
aVhave been trained through the initiative,
p229
aVthrough the involvement of World Wildlife Fund
p230
aVin the most up-to-date conservation practices.
p231
aVThey have also given funding for two decades
p232
aVto this whole program.
p233
aVAnd so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,
p234
aVwe've been able to scale up the very small programs
p235
aVto national programs today.
p236
aVNamibia ... or Sesfontein
p237
aVwas no more an isolated village somewhere,
p238
aVhidden away in Namibia.
p239
aVWith these assets we are now part of the global village.
p240
aa(lp241
VThirty years have passed
p242
aVsince my father's first job as a community game guard.
p243
aVIt's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success
p244
aVas I and my children see it today.
p245
aVWhen I finished school in 1995,
p246
aVthere were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest \u2014 in our area.
p247
aVBut today, there are more than 130 lions.
p248
aV(Applause)
p249
aVSo please, if you go to Namibia,
p250
aVmake sure that you stay in the tents.
p251
aVDon't walk out at night!
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VThe black rhino \u2014 they were almost extinct in 1982.
p256
aVBut today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino \u2014
p257
aVfree-roaming black rhinos \u2014 in the world.
p258
aVThis is outside the protected area.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VThe leopard \u2014 they are now in big numbers
p263
aVbut they are now far away from our village,
p264
aVbecause the natural plain has multiplied,
p265
aVlike zebras, springboks and everything.
p266
aVThey stay very much far away
p267
aVbecause this other thing has multiplied
p268
aVfrom less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.
p269
aa(lp270
VWhat started as very small,
p271
aVcommunity rangers getting community involved,
p272
aVhas now grown into something that we call conservancies.
p273
aVConservancies are legally instituted institutions
p274
aVby the government,
p275
aVand these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.
p276
aVToday, we have got 60 conservancies
p277
aVthat manage and protect over 13 million hectares
p278
aVof land in Namibia.
p279
aVWe have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.
p280
aVNowhere else in the world
p281
aVhas community-adopted conservation at this scale.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VIn 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.
p286
aVThis is our new economy \u2014
p287
aVan economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
p288
aVAnd we are able to use this money for many things:
p289
aVVery importantly, we put it in education.
p290
aVSecondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.
p291
aVVery important as well \u2014 we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.
p292
aVYou know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.
p293
aVAnd this is the good news from Africa
p294
aVthat we have to shout from the rooftops.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd now, what the world really needs
p299
aVis for you to help me and our partners
p300
aVtake some of what we have learned in Namibia
p301
aVto other places with similar problems:
p302
aVplaces like Mongolia,
p303
aVor even in your own backyards,
p304
aVthe Northern Great Plains,
p305
aVwhere buffalo and other animals have suffered
p306
aVand many communities are in decline.
p307
aVI like that one:
p308
aVNamibia serving as a model to Africa,
p309
aVand Africa serving as a model to the United States.
p310
aV(Applause)
p311
aVWe were successful in Namibia
p312
aVbecause we dreamed of a future
p313
aVthat was much more than just a healthy wildlife.
p314
aVWe knew conservation would fail
p315
aVif it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.
p316
aVSo, come and talk to me about Namibia,
p317
aVand better yet, come to Namibia
p318
aVand see for yourself how we have done it.
p319
aVAnd please, do visit our website
p320
aVto learn more and see how you can help CBNRM
p321
