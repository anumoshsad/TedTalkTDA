VI'm going to talk about the power of a word:
p4
aVjihad.
p5
aa(lp6
VTo the vast majority of practicing Muslims,
p7
aVjihad is an internal struggle for the faith.
p8
aVIt is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,
p9
aVtemptation, lust, greed.
p10
aVIt is a struggle to try and live a life
p11
aVthat is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
p12
aVIn that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important
p13
aVto Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.
p14
aVIt's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,
p15
aVand there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
p16
aVAnd that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,
p17
aVMuslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,
p18
aVtheir daughters as much as their sons, in the same way
p19
aVthat, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,
p20
aVand Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,
p21
aVwhich means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut there have always been, in Islam, a small group,
p24
aVa minority, who believe that jihad
p25
aVis not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle
p26
aVagainst forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.
p27
aVAnd some of these people believe that in that struggle,
p28
aVit is sometimes okay to take up arms.
p29
aVAnd so the thousands of young Muslim men
p30
aVwho flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s
p31
aVto fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,
p32
aVin their minds they were fighting a jihad,
p33
aVthey were doing jihad,
p34
aVand they named themselves the Mujahideen,
p35
aVwhich is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.
p36
aVAnd we forget this now, but back then
p37
aVthe Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.
p38
aVWe thought of them as holy warriors who were taking
p39
aVthe good fight to the ungodly communists.
p40
aVAmerica gave them weapons, gave them money,
p41
aVgave them support, encouragement.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut within that group, a tiny, smaller group,
p44
aVa minority within a minority within a minority,
p45
aVwere coming up with a new and dangerous
p46
aVconception of jihad,
p47
aVand in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,
p48
aVand he refined the idea.
p49
aVHis idea of jihad was a global war of terror,
p50
aVprimarily targeted at the far enemy,
p51
aVat the crusaders from the West, against America.
p52
aVAnd the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad
p53
aVwere so horrendous, so monstrous,
p54
aVand had such great impact,
p55
aVthat his definition was the one that stuck,
p56
aVnot just here in the West.
p57
aVWe didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.
p58
aVWe just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers
p59
aVwere calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.
p60
aVBut it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,
p61
aVhis definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.
p62
aa(lp63
VA year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam
p64
aVof a very small mosque, an old man.
p65
aVFifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,
p66
aVafter the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that
p67
aVwould inspire her to live a spiritual life.
p68
aVBut he told me that after 9/11,
p69
aVhe began to have second thoughts.
p70
aVHe worried that if he called her by that name,
p71
aVespecially outdoors, outside in public,
p72
aVhe might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.
p73
aVOn Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons
p74
aVtrying to reclaim the meaning of the word,
p75
aVbut his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,
p76
aVthey had seen the videos. They had seen pictures
p77
aVof the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.
p78
aVThey had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,
p79
aVand claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried
p80
aVthat his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.
p81
aa(lp82
VHe was wrong. Some people were paying attention,
p83
aVbut for the wrong reasons.
p84
aVThe United States, at this point, was putting pressure
p85
aVon all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,
p86
aVto stamp out extremism in their societies,
p87
aVand this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs
p88
aVof the Tunisian intelligence service.
p89
aVThey had never paid him any attention before \u2014
p90
aVold man, small mosque \u2014
p91
aVbut now they began to pay visits,
p92
aVand sometimes they would drag him in for questions,
p93
aVand always the same question:
p94
aV"Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?
p95
aVWhy do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?
p96
aVDo you hate Americans?
p97
aVWhat is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"
p98
aa(lp99
VSo to the Tunisian intelligence agency,
p100
aVand organizations like it all over the Arab world,
p101
aVjihad equaled extremism,
p102
aVBin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.
p103
aVThat was the power of that word that he was able to do.
p104
aVAnd it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.
p105
aVHe told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,
p106
aVin his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,
p107
aVthat he took this word, this beautiful idea.
p108
aVHe didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it
p109
aVand debased it and corrupted it
p110
aVand turned it into something it was never meant to be,
p111
aVand then persuaded all of us that it always was
p112
aVa global jihad.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut the good news is
p115
aVthat the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.
p116
aVIt was dying well before he did,
p117
aVand now it's on its last legs.
p118
aVOpinion polls from all over the Muslim world show
p119
aVthat there is very little interest among Muslims
p120
aVin a global holy war against the West,
p121
aVagainst the far enemy.
p122
aVThe supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.
p123
aVThe supply of money \u2014 just as important, more important perhaps \u2014
p124
aVthe supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.
p125
aVThe wealthy fanatics who were previously
p126
aVsponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat does that mean for us in the West?
p129
aVDoes it mean we can break out the champagne,
p130
aVwash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?
p131
aVNo. Disengagement is not an option,
p132
aVbecause if you let local jihad survive,
p133
aVit becomes international jihad.
p134
aVAnd so there's now a lot of different
p135
aVviolent jihads all over the world.
p136
aVIn Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,
p137
aVin Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim
p138
aVto be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.
p139
aVThey use his rhetoric.
p140
aVThey even use the brand name he created for his jihad.
p141
aVSo there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,
p142
aVthere's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,
p143
aVthere is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
p144
aVThere are other groups \u2014 in Nigeria, Boko Haram,
p145
aVin Somalia, al Shabaab \u2014 and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.
p146
aVBut if you look closely,
p147
aVthey're not fighting a global jihad.
p148
aVThey're fighting battles over much narrower issues.
p149
aVUsually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,
p150
aVor it's a power struggle.
p151
aVMore often than not, it's a power struggle
p152
aVin one country, or even a small region within one country.
p153
aVOccasionally they will go across a border,
p154
aVfrom Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,
p155
aVfrom Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting
p156
aVa global jihad against some far enemy.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut that doesn't mean
p159
aVthat we can relax.
p160
aVI was in Yemen recently, where \u2014 it's the home
p161
aVof the last al Qaeda franchise
p162
aVthat still aspires to attack America, attack the West.
p163
aVIt's old school al Qaeda.
p164
aVYou may remember these guys.
p165
aVThey are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,
p166
aVand they were using the Internet to try and instigate
p167
aVviolence among American Muslims.
p168
aVBut they have been distracted recently.
p169
aVLast year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,
p170
aVand ran it, Taliban-style.
p171
aVAnd then the Yemeni military got its act together,
p172
aVand ordinary people rose up against these guys
p173
aVand drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,
p174
aVmost of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo I think we've come to a point now where we can say
p177
aVthat, just like all politics, all jihad is local.
p178
aVBut that's still not reason for us to disengage,
p179
aVbecause we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.
p180
aVWhen those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,
p181
aVwe disengaged.
p182
aVAnd even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,
p183
aVthe Taliban had taken over in Kabul,
p184
aVand we said, "Local jihad, not our problem."
p185
aVAnd then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar
p186
aVto Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.
p187
aVLocal jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe good news is that it doesn't have to be.
p190
aVWe know how to fight it now.
p191
aVWe have the tools. We have the knowhow,
p192
aVand we can take the lessons we've learned
p193
aVfrom the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,
p194
aVand apply those to local jihad.
p195
aa(lp196
VWhat are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:
p197
aVSEAL Team Six.
p198
aVDo we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?
p199
aVWho ended the global jihad?
p200
aVThere lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.
p201
aa(lp202
VWho killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.
p203
aVHe probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.
p204
aVIn reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.
p205
aVHe killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled
p206
aVthe Muslim world with horror and revulsion,
p207
aVand what that meant was that his idea of jihad
p208
aVcould never become mainstream.
p209
aVHe condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes
p210
aVof his own community.
p211
aV9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.
p212
aa(lp213
VWho killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.
p214
aVHe was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq
p215
aVwho sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack
p216
aVnot Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.
p217
aVAny claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam
p218
aVagainst the Western crusaders
p219
aVwas drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.
p220
aa(lp221
VWho killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.
p222
aVWho killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,
p223
aVAl Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,
p224
aVbecause they circumvented the old, state-owned
p225
aVtelevision stations in a lot of these countries
p226
aVwhich were designed to keep information from people.
p227
aVAl Jazeera brought information to them, showed them
p228
aVwhat was being said and done in the name of their religion,
p229
aVexposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,
p230
aVand allowed them, gave them the information
p231
aVthat allowed them to come to their own conclusions.
p232
aa(lp233
VWho killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,
p234
aVbecause it showed a way for young Muslims
p235
aVto bring about change
p236
aVin a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his
p237
aVlimited imagination, could never have conceived.
p238
aa(lp239
VWho defeated the global jihad? The American military did,
p240
aVthe American soldiers did, with their allies,
p241
aVfighting in faraway battlefields.
p242
aVAnd perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo all these factors, and many more besides,
p245
aVwe don't even fully understand some of them yet,
p246
aVthese came together
p247
aVto defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,
p248
aVthe global jihad, you needed this group effort.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, not all of these things will work in local jihad.
p251
aVThe American military is not going to march into Nigeria
p252
aVto take on Boko Haram,
p253
aVand it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel
p254
aVinto the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut many of these other factors that were in play
p257
aVare now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.
p258
aVWe don't have to reinvent the wheel.
p259
aVThe notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed
p260
aVthan any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.
p261
aVWe don't have to go back to that.
p262
aVSatellite television and the Internet are informing
p263
aVand empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.
p264
aVAnd the Arab Spring has produced governments,
p265
aVmany of them Islamist governments,
p266
aVwho know that, for their own self-preservation,
p267
aVthey need to take on the extremists in their midsts.
p268
aVWe don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,
p269
aVbecause they haven't really come to this place before.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need
p272
aVwe already have, and we are very good at giving:
p273
aVeconomic assistance, not just money, but expertise,
p274
aVtechnology, knowhow,
p275
aVprivate investment, fair terms of trade,
p276
aVmedicine, education, technical support for training
p277
aVfor their police forces to become more effective,
p278
aVfor their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.
p279
aVWe've got plenty of these things.
p280
aa(lp281
VSome of the other things that they need
p282
aVwe're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.
p283
aVTime, patience, subtlety, understanding \u2014
p284
aVthese are harder to give.
p285
aVI live in New York now. Just this week,
p286
aVposters have gone up in subway stations in New York
p287
aVthat describe jihad as savage.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,
p290
aVI have never been as optimistic as I am today
p291
aVthat the gap between the Muslim world and the West
p292
aVis narrowing fast,
p293
aVand one of the many reasons for my optimism
p294
aVis that, because I know there are millions,
p295
aVhundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam
p296
aVin Tunis, who are reclaiming this word
p297
aVand restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.
p298
aVBin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.
p299
aVHis definition of jihad can now be expunged.
p300
aVTo that jihad we can say, "Goodbye. Good riddance."
p301
aVTo the real jihad we can say, "Welcome back. Good luck."
p302
aVThank you. (Applause)
