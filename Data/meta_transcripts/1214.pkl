VI'm a filmmaker.
p4
aVFor the last 8 years,
p5
aVI have dedicated my life
p6
aVto documenting the work
p7
aVof Israelis and Palestinians
p8
aVwho are trying to end the conflict
p9
aVusing peaceful means.
p10
aVWhen I travel with my work
p11
aVacross Europe and the United States,
p12
aVone question always comes up:
p13
aVWhere is the Palestinian Gandhi?
p14
aVWhy aren't Palestinians
p15
aVusing nonviolent resistance?
p16
aa(lp17
VThe challenge I face when I hear this question
p18
aVis that often I have just returned from the Middle East
p19
aVwhere I spent my time
p20
aVfilming dozens of Palestinians
p21
aVwho are using nonviolence
p22
aVto defend their lands
p23
aVand water resources
p24
aVfrom Israeli soldiers and settlers.
p25
aVThese leaders are trying to forge
p26
aVa massive national nonviolent movement
p27
aVto end the occupation
p28
aVand build peace in the region.
p29
aVYet, most of you
p30
aVhave probably never heard about them.
p31
aVThis divide between what's happening on the ground
p32
aVand perceptions abroad
p33
aVis one of the key reasons
p34
aVwhy we don't have yet
p35
aVa Palestinian peaceful resistance movement
p36
aVthat has been successful.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I'm here today
p39
aVto talk about the power of attention,
p40
aVthe power of your attention,
p41
aVand the emergence and development
p42
aVof nonviolent movements
p43
aVin the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere \u2014
p44
aVbut today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
p45
aVI believe that what's mostly missing
p46
aVfor nonviolence to grow
p47
aVis not for Palestinians
p48
aVto start adopting nonviolence,
p49
aVbut for us to start paying attention
p50
aVto those who already are.
p51
aVAllow me to illustrate this point
p52
aVby taking you to this village
p53
aVcalled Budrus.
p54
aa(lp55
VAbout seven years ago,
p56
aVthey faced extinction,
p57
aVbecause Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,
p58
aVand part of this barrier
p59
aVwould be built on top of the village.
p60
aVThey would lose 40 percent of their land
p61
aVand be surrounded,
p62
aVso they would lose free access
p63
aVto the rest of the West Bank.
p64
aVThrough inspired local leadership,
p65
aVthey launched a peaceful resistance campaign
p66
aVto stop that from happening.
p67
aa(lp68
VLet me show you some brief clips,
p69
aVso you have a sense
p70
aVfor what that actually looked like on the ground.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Music)

aa(lp74
VPalestinian Woman: We were told the wall
p75
aVwould separate Palestine from Israel.
p76
aVHere in Budrus,
p77
aVwe realized the wall would steal our land.
p78
aa(lp79
VIsraeli Man: The fence has, in fact,
p80
aVcreated a solution to terror.
p81
aa(lp82
VMan: Today you're invited
p83
aVto a peaceful march.
p84
aVYou are joined
p85
aVby dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
p86
aa(lp87
VIsraeli Activist: Nothing scares the army
p88
aVmore than nonviolent opposition.
p89
aa(lp90
VWoman: We saw the men
p91
aVtrying to push the soldiers,
p92
aVbut none of them could do that.
p93
aVBut I think the girls could do it.
p94
aa(lp95
VFatah Party Member: We must empty our minds
p96
aVof traditional thinking.
p97
aa(lp98
VHamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,
p99
aVand we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
p100
aa(lp101
VChanting: One united nation.
p102
aVFatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
p103
aVNews Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
p104
aa(lp105
VReporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
p106
aVThey were allowed to use any force necessary.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Gunshots)
p109
aa(lp110
VMan: These are live bullets.
p111
aVIt's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
p112
aa(lp113
VIsraeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
p114
aVBut there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
p115
aa(lp116
VIsraeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest
p117
aVis not going to stop the [unclear].
p118
aa(lp119
VProtester: This is a peaceful march.
p120
aVThere is no need to use violence.
p121
aa(lp122
VChanting: We can do it! We can do it!
p123
aVWe can do it!
p124
aa(lp125
VJulia Bacha: When I first heard
p126
aVabout the story of Budrus,
p127
aVI was surprised
p128
aVthat the international media had failed to cover
p129
aVthe extraordinary set of events
p130
aVthat happened seven years ago,
p131
aVin 2003.
p132
aVWhat was even more surprising
p133
aVwas the fact that Budrus was successful.
p134
aVThe residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,
p135
aVconvinced the Israeli government
p136
aVto move the route of the barrier off their lands
p137
aVand to the green line,
p138
aVwhich is the internationally recognized boundary
p139
aVbetween Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
p140
aVThe resistance in Budrus
p141
aVhas since spread
p142
aVto villages across the West Bank
p143
aVand to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
p144
aVYet the media remains mostly silent
p145
aVon these stories.
p146
aVThis silence carries profound consequences
p147
aVfor the likelihood
p148
aVthat nonviolence can grow,
p149
aVor even survive,
p150
aVin Palestine.
p151
aa(lp152
VViolent resistance
p153
aVand nonviolent resistance
p154
aVshare one very important thing in common;
p155
aVthey are both a form of theater
p156
aVseeking an audience to their cause.
p157
aVIf violent actors
p158
aVare the only ones constantly getting front-page covers
p159
aVand attracting international attention
p160
aVto the Palestinian issue,
p161
aVit becomes very hard
p162
aVfor nonviolent leaders
p163
aVto make the case to their communities
p164
aVthat civil disobedience
p165
aVis a viable option
p166
aVin addressing their plight.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe power of attention
p169
aVis probably going to come as no surprise
p170
aVto the parents in the room.
p171
aVThe surest way
p172
aVto make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums
p173
aVis by giving him attention
p174
aVthe first time he throws a fit.
p175
aVThe tantrum will become
p176
aVwhat childhood psychologists call
p177
aVa functional behavior,
p178
aVsince the child has learned
p179
aVthat he can get parental attention out of it.
p180
aVParents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior
p181
aVsimply by giving or withdrawing
p182
aVattention to their children.
p183
aVBut that's true for adults too.
p184
aVIn fact, the behavior
p185
aVof entire communities and countries
p186
aVcan be influenced,
p187
aVdepending on where
p188
aVthe international community chooses
p189
aVto focus its attention.
p190
aa(lp191
VI believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East
p192
aVand bringing peace
p193
aVis for us
p194
aVto transform nonviolence
p195
aVinto a functional behavior
p196
aVby giving a lot more attention
p197
aVto the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
p198
aVIn the course of taking my film to villages
p199
aVin the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,
p200
aVI have seen the impact
p201
aVthat even one documentary film can have
p202
aVin influencing the transformation.
p203
aa(lp204
VIn a village called Wallajeh,
p205
aVwhich sits very close to Jerusalem,
p206
aVthe community was facing
p207
aVa very similar plight to Budrus.
p208
aVThey were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands
p209
aVand not have freedom of access,
p210
aVeither to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
p211
aVThey had been using nonviolence for about two years
p212
aVbut had grown disenchanted
p213
aVsince nobody was paying attention.
p214
aVSo we organized a screening.
p215
aVA week later,
p216
aVthey held the most well-attended
p217
aVand disciplined
p218
aVdemonstration to date.
p219
aVThe organizers say
p220
aVthat the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus
p221
aVdocumented in a film,
p222
aVfelt that there were indeed people
p223
aVfollowing what they were doing,
p224
aVthat people cared.
p225
aVSo they kept on going.
p226
aa(lp227
VOn the Israeli side,
p228
aVthere is a new peace movement called Solidariot,
p229
aVwhich means solidarity in Hebrew.
p230
aVThe leaders of this movement have been using Budrus
p231
aVas one of their primary recruiting tools.
p232
aVThey report
p233
aVthat Israelis who had never been active before,
p234
aVupon seeing the film,
p235
aVunderstand the power of nonviolence
p236
aVand start joining their activities.
p237
aVThe examples of Wallajeh
p238
aVand the Solidariot movement
p239
aVshow that even a small-budget independent film
p240
aVcan play a role
p241
aVin transforming nonviolence
p242
aVinto a functional behavior.
p243
aVNow imagine the power
p244
aVthat big media players could have
p245
aVif they started covering
p246
aVthe weekly nonviolent demonstrations
p247
aVhappening in villages
p248
aVlike Bil'in, Ni'lin,
p249
aVWallajeh,
p250
aVin Jerusalem neighborhoods
p251
aVlike Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan \u2014
p252
aVthe nonviolent leaders
p253
aVwould become more visible,
p254
aVvalued and effective
p255
aVin their work.
p256
aa(lp257
VI believe
p258
aVthat the most important thing
p259
aVis to understand
p260
aVthat if we don't pay attention to these efforts,
p261
aVthey are invisible,
p262
aVand it's as if they never happened.
p263
aVBut I have seen first hand
p264
aVthat if we do,
p265
aVthey will multiply.
p266
aVIf they multiply,
p267
aVtheir influence will grow
p268
aVin the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
p269
aVAnd theirs is the kind of influence
p270
aVthat can finally
p271
aVunblock the situation.
p272
aVThese leaders have proven that nonviolence works
p273
aVin places like Budrus.
p274
aVLet's give them attention
p275
aVso they can prove it works everywhere.
