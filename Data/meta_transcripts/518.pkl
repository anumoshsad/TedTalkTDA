(lp3
VIt's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules
p4
aVthat I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.
p5
aVMost of them are pretty basic.
p6
aa(lp7
VNumber one: don't let go \u2014
p8
aVvery sure success method.
p9
aVBut really, truly \u2014 often you think about
p10
aVletting go way before your body does.
p11
aVSo hang in there,
p12
aVand you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.
p13
aa(lp14
VNumber two: hesitation is bad.
p15
aVThis is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,
p16
aVin the Yosemite high country.
p17
aVFriction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.
p18
aVYou're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.
p19
aVThe most friction you have is when you first put your hand
p20
aVor your foot on the rock.
p21
aVAnd then from that point on, you're basically falling.
p22
aVSo momentum is good. Don't stop.
p23
aa(lp24
VRule number three: have a plan.
p25
aVThis is a climb called the Naked Edge,
p26
aVin El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.
p27
aVThis climber is on the last pitch of it.
p28
aVHe's actually right about where I fell.
p29
aVThere is about 1,000 feet of air below him.
p30
aVAnd all the hard pitches are actually below him.
p31
aVOften what happens is
p32
aVyou're planning so hard for like,
p33
aV"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"
p34
aVAnd then what happens?
p35
aVYou get to the last pitch. It's easy.
p36
aVAnd you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.
p37
aVYou have to plan ahead to get to the top.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut you also can't forget that each individual move
p40
aVyou have to be able to complete.
p41
aVThis is a climb called the Dike Route,
p42
aVon Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.
p43
aVThe interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.
p44
aVBut if you're the leader on it,
p45
aVat the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,
p46
aVonto some low angle slabs.
p47
aVSo you've got to focus.
p48
aVYou don't want to stop in the middle like
p49
aVColeridge's Kubla Kahn.
p50
aVYou've got to keep going.
p51
aa(lp52
VRule number five: know how to rest.
p53
aVIt's amazing. The best climbers
p54
aVare the ones that in the most extreme situations
p55
aVcan get their bodies into some position
p56
aVwhere they can rest,
p57
aVregroup, calm themselves, focus,
p58
aVand keep going.
p59
aVThis is a climb in the Needles, again in California.
p60
aa(lp61
VFear really sucks because what it means is
p62
aVyou're not focusing on what you're doing.
p63
aVYou're focusing on the consequences of
p64
aVfailing at what you're doing
p65
aVbecause any given move should require
p66
aVall your concentration and thought processes
p67
aVto execute it effectively.
p68
aa(lp69
VOne of the things in climbing is, most people
p70
aVsort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.
p71
aVThis is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,
p72
aVwhich is a columnar basalt formation
p73
aVthat most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."
p74
aVWith this, typically crack climbers
p75
aVwould put their hands in and their toes in
p76
aVand just start climbing.
p77
aVThe cracks are too small to get your toes into
p78
aVso the only way to climb is using your fingertips
p79
aVin the cracks,
p80
aVand using opposing pressure
p81
aVand forcing yourself up.
p82
aa(lp83
VRule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.
p84
aVIn the 35 years I've been a climbing guide
p85
aVand taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,
p86
aVthe most important thing I've learned
p87
aVwas, guys will always try to do pull-ups.
p88
aVBeginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,
p89
aVthey get 15 feet up \u2014
p90
aVand they can do about 15 pull-ups right \u2014
p91
aVAnd then they just flame out.
p92
aVWomen are much more in balance
p93
aVbecause they don't have that idea
p94
aVthat they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.
p95
aVThey think about how to get the weight over their feet
p96
aVbecause it's sort of natural \u2014 they carry you all day long.
p97
aVSo balance is really critical,
p98
aVand keeping your weight on your feet,
p99
aVwhich is your strongest muscle.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd of course there is rule number nine.
p102
aVI came up with rule number nine after
p103
aVI actually didn't plan for a fall,
p104
aVand went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.
p105
aVOnce you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,
p106
aVyou need to start thinking about how you're going to let go
p107
aVbecause that is the critical piece
p108
aVof not getting hurt \u2014
p109
aVhow you're going to fall onto the rope,
p110
aVor if you're climbing without a rope,
p111
aVfall to a place where you can actually control the fall.
p112
aVSo don't hang on till the bitter end.
p113
aVThank you very much.
