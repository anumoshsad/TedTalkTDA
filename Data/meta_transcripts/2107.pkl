VFifty-four percent of the world's population
p4
aVlives in our cities.
p5
aVIn developing countries,
p6
aVone third of that population
p7
aVis living in slums.
p8
aVSeventy-five percent of global energy consumption
p9
aVoccurs in our cities,
p10
aVand 80 percent of gas emissions
p11
aVthat cause global warming
p12
aVcome from our cities.
p13
aVSo things that you and I might think about
p14
aVas global problems,
p15
aVlike climate change, the energy crisis
p16
aVor poverty,
p17
aVare really, in many ways, city problems.
p18
aVThey will not be solved
p19
aVunless people who live in cities,
p20
aVlike most of us,
p21
aVactually start doing a better job,
p22
aVbecause right now, we are  not doing a very good one.
p23
aVAnd that becomes very clear
p24
aVwhen we look into three aspects of city life:
p25
aVfirst, our citizens' willingness to engage
p26
aVwith democratic institutions;
p27
aVsecond, our cities' ability to really include
p28
aVall of their residents;
p29
aVand lastly, our own ability
p30
aVto live fulfilling and happy lives.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhen it comes to engagement,
p33
aVthe data is very clear.
p34
aVVoter turnout around the world
p35
aVpeaked in the late '80s,
p36
aVand it has been declining at a pace
p37
aVthat we have never seen before,
p38
aVand if those numbers are bad at the national level,
p39
aVat the level of our cities,
p40
aVthey are just dismal.
p41
aVIn the last two years,
p42
aVtwo of the world's most consolidated,
p43
aVoldest democracies, the U.S. and France,
p44
aVheld nationwide municipal elections.
p45
aVIn France, voter turnout hit a record low.
p46
aVAlmost 40 percent of voters decided
p47
aVnot to show up.
p48
aVIn the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.
p49
aVIn some American cities,
p50
aVvoter turnout was close to five percent.
p51
aVI'll let that sink in for a second.
p52
aVWe're talking about democratic cities
p53
aVin which 95 percent of people
p54
aVdecided that it was not important
p55
aVto elect their leaders.
p56
aVThe city of L.A., a city of four million people,
p57
aVelected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.
p58
aVThat was the lowest turnout the city had seen
p59
aVin 100 years.
p60
aVRight here, in my city of Rio,
p61
aVin spite of mandatory voting,
p62
aValmost 30 percent of the voting population
p63
aVchose to either annul their votes
p64
aVor stay home and pay a fine
p65
aVin the last mayoral elections.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen it comes to inclusiveness,
p68
aVour cities are not the best cases of success either,
p69
aVand again, you don't need to look very far
p70
aVin order to find proof of that.
p71
aVThe city of Rio is incredibly unequal.
p72
aVThis is Leblon.
p73
aVLeblon is the city's richest neighborhood.
p74
aVAnd this is Complexo do Alemão.
p75
aVThis is where over 70,000
p76
aVof the city's poorest residents live.
p77
aVLeblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,
p78
aVof .967.
p79
aVThat is higher than Norway, Switzerland
p80
aVor Sweden.
p81
aVComplexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.
p82
aVIt sits somewhere in between the HDI
p83
aVof Algeria and Gabon.
p84
aVSo Rio, like so many cities across the global South,
p85
aVis a place where you can go from northern Europe
p86
aVto sub-Saharan Africa
p87
aVin the space of 30 minutes.
p88
aVIf you drive, that is.
p89
aVIf you take public transit, it's about two hours.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd lastly, perhaps most importantly,
p92
aVcities, with the incredible wealth
p93
aVof relations that they enable,
p94
aVcould be the ideal places for human happiness
p95
aVto flourish.
p96
aVWe like being around people.
p97
aVWe are social animals.
p98
aVInstead, countries where urbanization
p99
aVhas already peaked seem to be the very countries
p100
aVin which cities have stopped making us happy.
p101
aVThe United States population has suffered
p102
aVfrom a general decrease in happiness
p103
aVfor the past three decades,
p104
aVand the main reason is this.
p105
aVThe American way of building cities
p106
aVhas caused good quality public spaces
p107
aVto virtually disappear in many,
p108
aVmany American cities,
p109
aVand as a result, they have seen
p110
aVa decline of relations,
p111
aVof the things that make us happy.
p112
aVMany studies show an increase
p113
aVin solitude and a decrease in solidarity,
p114
aVhonesty, and social and civic participation.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo how do we start building cities
p117
aVthat make us care?
p118
aVCities that value their most important asset:
p119
aVthe incredible diversity
p120
aVof the people who live in them?
p121
aVCities that make us happy?
p122
aVWell, I believe that if we want to change
p123
aVwhat our cities look like,
p124
aVthen we really have to change
p125
aVthe decision-making processes
p126
aVthat have given us the results  that we have right now.
p127
aVWe need a participation revolution,
p128
aVand we need it fast.
p129
aVThe idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship
p130
aVdoes not make sense anymore.
p131
aVPeople are tired of only being treated
p132
aVas empowered individuals every few years
p133
aVwhen it's time to delegate that power
p134
aVto someone else.
p135
aVIf the protests that swept Brazil
p136
aVin June 2013 have taught us anything,
p137
aVit's that every time we try
p138
aVto exercise our power
p139
aVoutside of an electoral context,
p140
aVwe are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.
p141
aVAnd this needs to change,
p142
aVbecause when it does,
p143
aVnot only will people re-engage
p144
aVwith the structures of representation,
p145
aVbut also complement these structures
p146
aVwith direct, effective, and  collective decision making,
p147
aVdecision making of the kind
p148
aVthat attacks inequality
p149
aVby its very inclusive nature,
p150
aVdecision making of the kind
p151
aVthat can change our cities
p152
aVinto better places for us to live.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut there is a catch, obviously:
p155
aVEnabling widespread participation
p156
aVand redistributing power
p157
aVcan be a logistical nightmare,
p158
aVand there's where technology can play
p159
aVan incredibly helpful role,
p160
aVby making it easier for people to organize,
p161
aVcommunicate and make decisions
p162
aVwithout having to be in the same room
p163
aVat the same time.
p164
aa(lp165
VUnfortunately for us,
p166
aVwhen it comes to fostering democratic processes,
p167
aVour city governments have not used technology
p168
aVto its full potential.
p169
aVSo far, most city governments have been effective
p170
aVat using tech to turn citizens into human sensors
p171
aVwho serve authorities with data on the city:
p172
aVpotholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.
p173
aVThey have also, to a lesser extent,
p174
aVinvited people to participate in improving
p175
aVthe outcome of decisions
p176
aVthat were already made for them,
p177
aVjust like my mom when I was eight
p178
aVand she told me that I had a choice:
p179
aVI had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,
p180
aVbut I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas.
p181
aVThat's not participation,
p182
aVand in fact, governments have not been very good
p183
aVat using technology to enable participation
p184
aVon what matters \u2014
p185
aVthe way we allocate our budget,
p186
aVthe way we occupy our land,
p187
aVand the way we manage our natural resources.
p188
aVThose are the kinds of decisions
p189
aVthat can actually impact global problems
p190
aVthat manifest themselves in our cities.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe good news is,
p193
aVand I do have good news to share with you,
p194
aVwe don't need to wait for governments to do this.
p195
aVI have reason to believe
p196
aVthat it's possible for citizens to build
p197
aVtheir own structures of participation.
p198
aVThree years ago, I cofounded an organization
p199
aVcalled Meu Rio,
p200
aVand we make it easier for people in the city of Rio
p201
aVto organize around causes and places
p202
aVthat they care about in their own city,
p203
aVand have an impact on those causes and places
p204
aVevery day.
p205
aVIn these past three years, Meu Rio grew
p206
aVto a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.
p207
aVAbout 40 percent of those  members are young people
p208
aVaged 20 to 29.
p209
aVThat is one in every 15 young people
p210
aVof that age in Rio today.
p211
aa(lp212
VAmongst our members is this adorable little girl,
p213
aVBia, to your right,
p214
aVand Bia was just 11 years old
p215
aVwhen she started a campaign using one of our tools
p216
aVto save her model public school from demolition.
p217
aVHer school actually ranks among the best
p218
aVpublic schools in the country,
p219
aVand it was going to be demolished
p220
aVby the Rio de Janeiro state government
p221
aVto build, I kid you not,
p222
aVa parking lot for the World Cup
p223
aVright before the event happened.
p224
aVBia started a campaign, and we even watched
p225
aVher school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,
p226
aVand many months afterwards,
p227
aVthe government changed their minds.
p228
aVBia's school stayed in place.
p229
aa(lp230
VThere's also Jovita.
p231
aVShe's an amazing woman whose daughter
p232
aVwent missing about 10 years ago,
p233
aVand since then, she has been looking
p234
aVfor her daughter.
p235
aVIn that process, she found out
p236
aVthat first, she was not alone.
p237
aVIn the last year alone, 2013,
p238
aV6,000 people disappeared
p239
aVin the state of Rio.
p240
aVBut she also found out that in spite of that,
p241
aVRio had no centralized intelligence system
p242
aVfor solving missing persons cases.
p243
aVIn other Brazilian cities, those systems
p244
aVhave helped solve up to 80 percent
p245
aVof missing persons cases.
p246
aVShe started a campaign,
p247
aVand after the secretary of  security got 16,000 emails
p248
aVfrom people asking him to do this,
p249
aVhe responded, and started to build a police unit
p250
aVspecializing in those cases.
p251
aVIt was open to the public at the end of last month,
p252
aVand Jovita was there
p253
aVgiving interviews and being very fancy.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd then, there is Leandro.
p256
aVLeandro is an amazing guy
p257
aVin a slum in Rio,
p258
aVand he created a recycling project in the slum.
p259
aVAt the end of last year, December 16,
p260
aVhe received an eviction order
p261
aVby the Rio de Janeiro state government
p262
aVgiving him two weeks to leave the space
p263
aVthat he had been using for two years.
p264
aVThe plan was to hand it over to a developer,
p265
aVwho planned to turn it into a construction site.
p266
aVLeandro started a campaign using one of our tools,
p267
aVthe Pressure Cooker,
p268
aVthe same one that Bia and Jovita used,
p269
aVand the state government changed their minds
p270
aVbefore Christmas Eve.
p271
aa(lp272
VThese stories make me happy,
p273
aVbut not just because they have happy endings.
p274
aVThey make me happy because they are
p275
aVhappy beginnings.
p276
aVThe teacher and parent community at Bia's school
p277
aVis looking for other ways they could improve
p278
aVthat space even further.
p279
aVLeandro has ambitious plans
p280
aVto take his model to other low-income communities in Rio,
p281
aVand Jovita is volunteering at the police unit
p282
aVthat she helped created.
p283
aVBia, Jovita and Leandro
p284
aVare living examples of something
p285
aVthat citizens and city  governments around the world
p286
aVneed to know:
p287
aVWe are ready.
p288
aVAs citizens, we are ready
p289
aVto decide on our common destinies,
p290
aVbecause we know that the way we distribute power
p291
aVsays a lot about how we actually value everyone,
p292
aVand because we know
p293
aVthat enabling and participating in local politics
p294
aVis a sign that we truly care
p295
aVabout our relations to one another,
p296
aVand we are ready to do this
p297
aVin cities around the world right now.
p298
aVWith the Our Cities network,
p299
aVthe Meu Rio team
p300
aVhopes to share what we have learned
p301
aVwith other people who want to create
p302
aVsimilar initiatives in their own cities.
p303
aVWe have already started doing it in São Paulo
p304
aVwith incredible results,
p305
aVand want to take it to cities around the world
p306
aVthrough a network of citizen-centric,
p307
aVcitizen-led organizations
p308
aVthat can inspire us,
p309
aVchallenge us, and remind us to demand
p310
aVreal participation in our city lives.
p311
aa(lp312
VIt is up to us
p313
aVto decide whether we want schools
p314
aVor parking lots,
p315
aVcommunity-driven recycling projects
p316
aVor construction sites,
p317
aVloneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,
p318
aVand it is our responsibility to do that now,
p319
aVfor ourselves, for our families,
p320
aVfor the people who make our lives worth living,
p321
aVand for the incredible creativity,
p322
aVbeauty, and wonder that make our cities,
p323
aVin spite of all of their problems,
p324
aVthe greatest invention of our time.
