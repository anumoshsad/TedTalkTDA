VThe phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment
p4
aVis called quantum levitation and quantum locking.
p5
aVAnd the object that was levitating here
p6
aVis called a superconductor.
p7
aVSuperconductivity is a quantum state of matter,
p8
aVand it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, it's quite an old phenomenon;
p11
aVit was discovered 100 years ago.
p12
aVHowever, only recently,
p13
aVdue to several technological advancements,
p14
aVwe are now able to demonstrate to you
p15
aVquantum levitation and quantum locking.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, a superconductor is defined by two properties.
p18
aVThe first is zero electrical resistance,
p19
aVand the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.
p20
aVThat sounds complicated, right?
p21
aVBut what is electrical resistance?
p22
aVSo, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.
p23
aVAnd these electrons, while flowing,
p24
aVthey collide with the atoms, and in these collisions
p25
aVthey lose a certain amount of energy.
p26
aVAnd they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.
p27
aVHowever, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,
p28
aVso there is no energy dissipation.
p29
aa(lp30
VIt's quite remarkable. Think about it.
p31
aVIn classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.
p32
aVBut not here, because it is a quantum effect.
p33
aVBut that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.
p34
aVSo a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,
p35
aVand it has the means to do that by circulating currents.
p36
aVNow, the combination of both effects \u2014
p37
aVthe expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance \u2014
p38
aVis exactly a superconductor.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,
p41
aVand sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.
p42
aVNow, under proper conditions, which we have here,
p43
aVthese strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.
p44
aVAnd these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,
p45
aVthey come in discrete quantities.
p46
aVWhy? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.
p47
aVAnd it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
p50
aVThis is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,
p51
aVbut they behave like particles.
p52
aVSo, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?
p55
aVWell, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,
p56
aVbut now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,
p57
aVbecause their movements dissipate energy,
p58
aVwhich breaks the superconductivity state.
p59
aVSo what it actually does, it locks these strands,
p60
aVwhich are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.
p61
aVAnd by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.
p62
aVWhy? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,
p63
aVwill change their configuration.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.
p66
aVI have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.
p67
aVAnd when I place it on top of a regular magnet,
p68
aVit just stays locked in midair.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.
p73
aVI can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.
p74
aVLike this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.
p75
aVSo, this is quantum locking \u2014 actually locking \u2014 three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.
p76
aVOf course, I can turn it upside down,
p77
aVand it will remain locked.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,
p80
aVYeah, we understand that.
p81
aVYou won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,
p82
aVin which the magnetic field is the same all around,
p83
aVthe superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.
p84
aVWhy? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
p85
aVYou see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.
p86
aVWe have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.
p89
aVBut how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?
p90
aVWell, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.
p91
aVOne hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.
p94
aVAnd, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
p95
aVis only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.
p96
aVAnd this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.
p97
aVIt's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, I can extend this circular magnet,
p100
aVand make whatever track I want.
p101
aVFor example, I can make a large circular rail here.
p102
aVAnd when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,
p103
aVit moves freely.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,
p108
aVand it freely moves in this new position.
p109
aVAnd I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.
p110
aVI can take this disk and put it here,
p111
aVand while it stays here \u2014 don't move \u2014
p112
aVI will try to rotate the track,
p113
aVand hopefully, if I did it correctly,
p114
aVit stays suspended.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VYou see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.
p119
aVNow, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,
p120
aVlet me tell you a little bit about superconductors.
p121
aVNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p122
aVSo we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,
p123
aVso we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,
p124
aVsuch as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.
p125
aVBut we can also store energy using superconductors,
p126
aVbecause we have no dissipation.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.
p129
aVImagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.
p130
aVBut what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?
p131
aVWell, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.
p132
aVImagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,
p133
aVthree-inch diameter, with a single difference.
p134
aVThe superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,
p135
aVbeing two millimeters thin, quite thin.
p136
aVThis two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.
p137
aVAmazing. Thank you.
