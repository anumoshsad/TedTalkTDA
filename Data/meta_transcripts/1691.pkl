VChris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years
p4
aVof anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.
p5
aVThat's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."
p10
aa(lp11
VHe said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, yeah.
p14
aVThen I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.
p15
aVLet's go back before Christ, three millennia,
p16
aVto a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,
p17
aVthe march against inequality and poverty really began.
p18
aVThree thousand years ago,
p19
aVcivilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,
p20
aVsome slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,
p21
aVsmelling of sheep shit, I guess,
p22
aVproclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,
p23
aV"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.
p26
aVYou, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd they say, "No, no, that's what it says here
p29
aVin our holy book."
p30
aa(lp31
VCut to our century, same country, same pyramids,
p32
aVanother people spreading the same idea
p33
aVof equality with a different book.
p34
aVThis time it's called the Facebook.
p35
aVCrowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.
p36
aVThey turn a social network from virtual to actual,
p37
aVand kind of rebooted the 21st century.
p38
aVNot to undersell how messy and ugly
p39
aVthe aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,
p40
aVneither to oversell the role of technology,
p41
aVbut these things have given a sense of what's possible
p42
aVwhen the age-old model of power, the pyramid,
p43
aVgets turned upside down, putting the people on top
p44
aVand the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.
p45
aVIt's also shown us that something as powerful
p46
aVas information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,
p47
aVbecause facts, like people,
p48
aVwant to be free, and when they're free,
p49
aVliberty is usually around the corner,
p50
aVeven for the poorest of the poor \u2014
p51
aVfacts that can challenge cynicism
p52
aVand the apathy that leads to inertia,
p53
aVfacts that tell us what's working and,
p54
aVmore importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,
p55
aVfacts that if we hear them and heed them could help us
p56
aVmeet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made
p57
aVback in 2005,
p58
aVwhen he asked us to be that great generation
p59
aVthat overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,
p60
aVextreme poverty,
p61
aVfacts that build a powerful momentum.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I thought, forget the rock opera,
p64
aVforget the bombast, my usual tricks.
p65
aVThe only thing singing today would be the facts,
p66
aVfor I have truly embraced by inner nerd.
p67
aVSo exit the rock star.
p68
aVEnter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.
p69
aa(lp70
VBecause what the facts are telling us
p71
aVis that the long, slow journey,
p72
aVhumanity's long, slow journey of equality,
p73
aVis actually speeding up.
p74
aVLook at what's been achieved.
p75
aVLook at the pictures these data sets print.
p76
aVSince the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,
p77
aVthere are eight million more AIDS patients
p78
aVgetting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.
p79
aVMalaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p80
aVthat have their death rates cut by 75 percent.
p81
aVFor kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,
p82
aVit's down by 2.65 million a year.
p83
aVThat's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.
p84
aVWow. Wow. (Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VLet's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.
p87
aVHave you read anything anywhere in the last week
p88
aVthat is remotely as important as that number? Wow.
p89
aVGreat news. It drives me nuts
p90
aVthat most people don't seem to know this news.
p91
aVSeven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.
p92
aVThis is Michael and Benedicta,
p93
aVand they're alive thanks in large part
p94
aVto Dr. Patricia Asamoah \u2014 she's amazing \u2014
p95
aVand the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,
p96
aVwhether you know it or not.
p97
aVAnd the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs
p98
aVthat stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.
p99
aVThis fantastic news didn't happen by itself.
p100
aVIt was fought for, it was campaigned for,
p101
aVit was innovated for.
p102
aVAnd this great news gives birth to even more great news,
p103
aVbecause the historic trend is this.
p104
aVThe number of people living in back-breaking,
p105
aVsoul-crushing extreme poverty has declined
p106
aVfrom 43 percent of the world's population in 1990
p107
aVto 33 percent by 2000
p108
aVand then to 21 percent by 2010.
p109
aVGive it up for that. (Applause)
p110
aVHalved. Halved.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, the rate is still too high \u2014 still too many people
p113
aVunnecessarily losing their lives.
p114
aVThere's still work to do.
p115
aVBut it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.
p116
aVAnd if you live on less than $1.25 a day,
p117
aVif you live in that kind of poverty,
p118
aVthis is not just data.
p119
aVThis is everything.
p120
aVIf you're a parent who wants the best for your kids \u2014 and I am \u2014
p121
aVthis rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.
p122
aVAnd guess what? If the trajectory continues,
p123
aVlook where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day
p124
aVgets to by 2030.
p125
aVCan't be true, can it?
p126
aVThat's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,
p127
aVwe get to, wow, the zero zone.
p128
aVFor number-crunchers like us,
p129
aVthat is the erogenous zone,
p130
aVand it's fair to say that I am, by now,
p131
aVsexually aroused by the collating of data.
p132
aVSo virtual elimination of extreme poverty,
p133
aVas defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,
p134
aVadjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.
p135
aVWe do love a good baseline.
p136
aVThat's amazing.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow I know that some of you think this progress
p139
aVis all in Asia or Latin America or
p140
aVmodel countries like Brazil \u2014
p141
aVand who doesn't love a Brazilian model? \u2014
p142
aVbut look at sub-Saharan Africa.
p143
aVThere's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,
p144
aVwho in the last decade have had a combination
p145
aVof 100 percent debt cancellation,
p146
aVa tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI \u2014
p147
aVthat's foreign direct investment \u2014
p148
aVwhich has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources \u2014 that's local money \u2014
p149
aVwhich, when spent wisely \u2014 that's good governance \u2014
p150
aVcut childhood mortality by a third,
p151
aVdoubled education completion rates,
p152
aVand they, too, halved extreme poverty,
p153
aVand at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.
p154
aVSo the pride of lions
p155
aVis the proof of concept.
p156
aa(lp157
VThere are all kinds of benefits to this.
p158
aVFor a start, you won't have to listen
p159
aVto an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.
p160
aVHow about that? (Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.
p163
aVI mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.
p164
aV(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.
p165
aVMakes us look really young.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo why aren't we jumping up and down about this?
p168
aVWell, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.
p169
aVWe can't get this done until we really accept
p170
aVthat we can get this done.
p171
aVLook at this graph.
p172
aVIt's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.
p173
aVAnd the next one is really beautiful.
p174
aVIt's called momentum.
p175
aVAnd it's how we can bend the arc of history
p176
aVdown towards zero,
p177
aVjust doing the things that we know work.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo inertia versus momentum.
p180
aVThere is jeopardy, and of course,
p181
aVthe closer you get, it gets harder.
p182
aVWe know the obstacles that are in our way
p183
aVright now, in difficult times.
p184
aVIn fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,
p185
aVsome who mind the nation's purse want to cut
p186
aVlife-saving programs like the Global Fund.
p187
aVBut you can do something about that.
p188
aVYou can tell politicians
p189
aVthat these cuts [can cost] lives.
p190
aa(lp191
VRight now today, in Oslo as it happens,
p192
aVoil companies are fighting to keep secret
p193
aVtheir payments to governments
p194
aVfor extracting oil in developing countries.
p195
aVYou can do something about that too.
p196
aVYou can join the One Campaign,
p197
aVand leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.
p198
aVWe're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
p199
aVof the wealth under the ground
p200
aVends up in the hands of the people living above it.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd right now, we know
p203
aVthat the biggest disease of all
p204
aVis not a disease. It's corruption.
p205
aVBut there's a vaccine for that too.
p206
aVIt's called transparency, open data sets,
p207
aVsomething the TED community is really on it.
p208
aVDaylight, you could call it, transparency.
p209
aVAnd technology is really turbocharging this.
p210
aVIt's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo let me tell you about the U-report,
p213
aVwhich I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials
p214
aVall across Uganda, young people
p215
aVarmed with 2G phones, an SMS social network
p216
aVexposing government corruption
p217
aVand demanding to know what's in the budget
p218
aVand how their money is being spent.
p219
aVThis is exciting stuff.
p220
aa(lp221
VLook, once you have these tools,
p222
aVyou can't not use them.
p223
aVOnce you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.
p224
aVYou can't delete this data from your brain,
p225
aVbut you can delete the cliched image
p226
aVof supplicant, impoverished peoples
p227
aVnot taking control of their own lives.
p228
aVYou can erase that, you really can,
p229
aVbecause it's not true anymore. (Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VIt's transformational.
p232
aV2030? By 2030, robots,
p233
aVnot just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.
p234
aVBy the time we get there,
p235
aVevery place with a rough semblance of governance
p236
aVmight actually be on their way.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo I'm here to \u2014 I guess we're here
p239
aVto try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,
p240
aVthe one we call factivism.
p241
aVIt's not going to kill you.
p242
aVIn fact, it could save countless lives.
p243
aVI guess we in the One Campaign would love you
p244
aVto be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.
p245
aVBy doing so, you will join us and countless others
p246
aVin what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,
p247
aVthe ever-demanding journey of equality.
p248
aVCould we really be the great generation
p249
aVthat Mandela asked us to be?
p250
aVMight we answer that clarion call with science,
p251
aVwith reason, with facts,
p252
aVand, dare I say it, emotions?
p253
aVBecause as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.
p254
aa(lp255
VI'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.
p256
aVSome of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups
p257
aVbehind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.
p258
aVHe got thrown in jail for it,
p259
aVbut I have his words tattooed on my brain.
p260
aa(lp261
V"We are going to win because we don't understand politics.
p262
aVWe are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
p263
aVWe are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.
p264
aVWe are going to win because the tears
p265
aVthat come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.
p266
aVWe are going to win because we have dreams,
p267
aVand we're willing to stand up for those dreams."
p268
aa(lp269
VWael is right.
p270
aVWe're going to win
p271
aVif we work together as one,
p272
aVbecause the power of the people
p273
aVis so much stronger than the people in power.
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)
p278
aVThank you so much. (Applause)
