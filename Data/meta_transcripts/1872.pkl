VWhen we think of Nepal,
p4
aVwe tend to think of the snow-capped mountains
p5
aVof the Himalayas,
p6
aVthe crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,
p7
aVor the huge expanse of its grasslands.
p8
aVWhat some of us may not realize
p9
aVis that in the Himalayan foothills,
p10
aVwhere the climate is much warmer
p11
aVand the landscape much greener,
p12
aVthere lives a great diversity of wildlife,
p13
aVincluding the one-horned rhinoceros,
p14
aVthe Asian elephant
p15
aVand the Bengal tiger.
p16
aVBut unfortunately, these animals
p17
aVare under constant threat from poachers
p18
aVwho hunt and kill them for their body parts.
p19
aVTo stop the killing of these animals,
p20
aVbattalions of soldiers and rangers
p21
aVare sent to protect Nepal's national parks,
p22
aVbut that is not an easy task,
p23
aVbecause these soldiers have to patrol
p24
aVthousands of hectares of forests on foot
p25
aVor elephant backs.
p26
aVIt is also risky for these soldiers
p27
aVwhen they get into gunfights with poachers,
p28
aVand therefore Nepal is always looking
p29
aVfor new ways to help with protecting the forests
p30
aVand wildlife.
p31
aa(lp32
VWell recently, Nepal acquired a new tool
p33
aVin the fight against wildlife crime,
p34
aVand these are drones,
p35
aVor more specifically, conservation drones.
p36
aVFor about a year now, my colleagues and I
p37
aVhave been building drones for Nepal
p38
aVand training the park protection personnel
p39
aVon the use of these drones.
p40
aVNot only does a drone give you
p41
aVa bird's-eye view of the landscape,
p42
aVbut it also allows you to capture detailed,
p43
aVhigh-resolution images of objects on the ground.
p44
aVThis, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros
p45
aVtaking a cooling bath on a hot summer day
p46
aVin the lowlands of Nepal.
p47
aVNow we believe that drones have
p48
aVtremendous potential,
p49
aVnot only for combating wildlife crime,
p50
aVbut also for monitoring the health
p51
aVof these wildlife populations.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo what is a drone?
p54
aVWell, the kind of drone I'm talking about
p55
aVis simply a model aircraft
p56
aVfitted with an autopilot system,
p57
aVand this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,
p58
aVa GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter
p59
aVand a few other sensors.
p60
aVNow a drone like this
p61
aVis meant to carry a useful payload,
p62
aVsuch as a video camera
p63
aVor a photographic camera.
p64
aVIt also requires a software that allows the user
p65
aVto program a mission,
p66
aVto tell the drone where to go.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow people I talk to are often surprised
p69
aVwhen they hear that these are the only
p70
aVfour components that make a conservation drone,
p71
aVbut they are even more surprised
p72
aVwhen I tell them how affordable these components are.
p73
aVThe facts is, a conservation drone
p74
aVdoesn't cost very much more than
p75
aVa good laptop computer
p76
aVor a decent pair of binoculars.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo now that you've built your own conservation drone,
p79
aVyou probably want to go fly it,
p80
aVbut how does one fly a drone?
p81
aVWell, actually, you don't,
p82
aVbecause the drone flies itself.
p83
aVAll you have to do is to program a mission
p84
aVto tell the drone where to fly.
p85
aVBut you simply do that by clicking on
p86
aVa few way points on the Google Maps interface
p87
aVusing the open-source software.
p88
aVThose missions could be as simple
p89
aVas just a few way points,
p90
aVor they could be slightly longer and more complicated,
p91
aVto fly along a river system.
p92
aVSometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern
p93
aVand take pictures of that area,
p94
aVand those pictures can be processed
p95
aVto produce a map of that forest.
p96
aVOther researchers might want to fly the drone
p97
aValong the boundaries of a forest
p98
aVto watch out for poachers or people
p99
aVwho might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow whatever your mission is,
p102
aVonce you've programmed it,
p103
aVyou simply upload it to the autopilot system,
p104
aVbring your drone to the field,
p105
aVand launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
p106
aVAnd often we'll go about this mission
p107
aVtaking pictures or videos along the way,
p108
aVand usually at that point,
p109
aVwe will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,
p110
aVsit back, and relax for the next few minutes,
p111
aValthough some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes
p112
aVworrying that the drone will not return.
p113
aVUsually it does, and when it does,
p114
aVit even lands automatically.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo what can we do with a conservation drone?
p117
aVWell, when we built our first prototype drone,
p118
aVour main objective was to fly it over
p119
aVa remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,
p120
aVto look for the nest of a species of great ape
p121
aVknown as the orangutan.
p122
aVThe reason we wanted to do that was because
p123
aVwe needed to know how many individuals
p124
aVof this species are still left in that forest.
p125
aVNow the traditional method of surveying
p126
aVfor orangutans is to walk the forest on foot
p127
aVcarrying heavy equipment
p128
aVand to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops
p129
aVwhere you might find an orangutan or its nest.
p130
aVNow as you can imagine,
p131
aVthat is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,
p132
aVand costly process,
p133
aVso we were hoping that drones
p134
aVcould significantly reduce the cost of surveying
p135
aVfor orangutan populations in Indonesia
p136
aVand elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
p137
aVSo we were very excited when we captured
p138
aVour first pair of orangutan nests on camera.
p139
aVAnd this is it; this is the first ever picture
p140
aVof orangutan nests taken with a drone.
p141
aVSince then we have taken pictures
p142
aVof dozens of these nests
p143
aVfrom around various parts of Southeast Asia,
p144
aVand we're now working with computer scientists
p145
aVto develop algorithms that can automatically count
p146
aVthe number of nests from the thousands
p147
aVof photos we've collected so far.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut nests are not the only objects
p150
aVthese drones can detect.
p151
aVThis is a wild orangutan
p152
aVhappily feeding on top of a palm tree,
p153
aVseemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead,
p154
aVnot once but several times.
p155
aVWe've also taken pictures of other animals
p156
aVincluding forest buffalos in Gabon,
p157
aVelephants, and even turtle nests.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves,
p160
aVwe also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in,
p161
aVbecause we want to keep track
p162
aVof the health of these habitats.
p163
aVSometimes, we zoom out a little
p164
aVand look at other things that might be happening
p165
aVin the landscape.
p166
aVThis is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.
p167
aVNow oil palm is a major driver of deforestation
p168
aVin that part of the world,
p169
aVso we wanted to use this new drone technology
p170
aVto keep track of the spread of these plantations
p171
aVin Southeast Asia.
p172
aVBut drones could also be used to keep track of
p173
aVillegal logging activities.
p174
aVThis is a recently logged forest,
p175
aVagain in Sumatra.
p176
aVYou could even still see the processed
p177
aVwooden planks left on the ground.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut perhaps the most exciting part
p180
aVabout taking pictures from the air is
p181
aVwe could later stitch these pictures together
p182
aVusing special software to create a map
p183
aVof the entire landscape, and this map
p184
aVgives us crucial information
p185
aVfor monitoring land use change,
p186
aVto let us know where and when plantations might be expanding,
p187
aVwhere forests might be contracting,
p188
aVor where fires might be breaking out.
p189
aVAerial images could also be processed
p190
aVto produce three-dimensional
p191
aVcomputer models of forests.
p192
aVNow these models are not just visually appealing,
p193
aVbut they are also geometrically accurate,
p194
aVwhich means researchers can now measure
p195
aVthe distance between trees,
p196
aVcalculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,
p197
aVand so on, all of which are important information
p198
aVfor monitoring the health of these forests.
p199
aVRecently, we've also begun experimenting
p200
aVwith thermal imaging cameras.
p201
aVNow these cameras can detect
p202
aVheat-emitting objects from the ground,
p203
aVand therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo I've told you quite a lot about
p206
aVwhat conservation drones are,
p207
aVhow you might operate one of these drones,
p208
aVand what a drone could do for you.
p209
aVI will now tell you where conservation drones
p210
aVare being used around the world.
p211
aVWe built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.
p212
aVWe brought a few of these to Indonesia
p213
aVfor the first few test flights.
p214
aVSince then, we've been building drones
p215
aVfor our collaborators from around the world,
p216
aVand these include fellow biologists
p217
aVand partners from major conservation organizations.
p218
aa(lp219
VPerhaps the best and most rewarding part
p220
aVabout working with these collaborators
p221
aVis the feedback they give us
p222
aVon how to improve our drones.
p223
aVBuilding drones for us is
p224
aVa constant work in progress.
p225
aVWe are constantly trying to improve them in terms of
p226
aVtheir range, their ruggedness,
p227
aVand the amount of payload they can carry.
p228
aVWe also work with collaborators
p229
aVto discover new ways of using these drones.
p230
aVFor example, camera traps are a common tool
p231
aVused by biologists to take pictures of shy animals
p232
aVhiding in the forests,
p233
aVbut these are motion-activated cameras,
p234
aVso they snap a picture every time an animal
p235
aVcrosses their path.
p236
aVBut the problem with camera traps
p237
aVis that the researcher has to go back to the forest
p238
aVevery so often to retrieve those images,
p239
aVand that takes a lot of time,
p240
aVespecially if there are dozens
p241
aVor hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.
p242
aVNow a drone could be designed to perform the task
p243
aVmuch more efficiently.
p244
aVThis drone, carrying a special sensor,
p245
aVcould be flown over the forest
p246
aVand remotely download these images
p247
aVfrom wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.
p248
aa(lp249
VRadio collars are another tool
p250
aVthat's commonly used by biologists.
p251
aVNow these collars are put onto animals.
p252
aVThey transmit a radio signal which allows
p253
aVthe researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape.
p254
aVBut the traditional way of tracking animals
p255
aVis pretty ridiculous,
p256
aVbecause it requires the researcher to be walking
p257
aVon the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna,
p258
aVnot unlike those old TV antennae we used to have
p259
aVon our rooftops. Some of us still do.
p260
aVA drone could be used to do the same job
p261
aVmuch more efficiently.
p262
aVWhy not equip a drone
p263
aVwith a scanning radio receiver,
p264
aVfly that over the forest canopy
p265
aVin a certain pattern
p266
aVwhich would allow the user or the operator
p267
aVto triangulate the location
p268
aVof these radio-collared animals remotely
p269
aVwithout having to step foot in the forest.
p270
aa(lp271
VA third and perhaps most exciting way
p272
aVof using these drones
p273
aVis to fly them to a really remote,
p274
aVnever-explored-before rainforest
p275
aVsomewhere hidden in the tropics,
p276
aVand parachute down a tiny spy microphone
p277
aVthat would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls
p278
aVof mammals, birds, amphibians,
p279
aVthe Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.
p280
aVThat would give us biologists
p281
aVa pretty good idea of what animals
p282
aVmight be living in those forests.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd finally, I would like to show you
p285
aVthe latest version of our conservation drone.
p286
aVThe MAJA drone has a wingspan
p287
aVof about two meters.
p288
aVIt weighs only about two kilograms,
p289
aVbut it can carry half its weight.
p290
aVIt is a fully autonomous system.
p291
aVDuring its mission, it can even transmit
p292
aVa live video feed back to a ground station laptop,
p293
aVwhich allows the user
p294
aVto see what the drone is seeing in real time.
p295
aVIt carries a variety of sensors,
p296
aVand the photo quality of some of these sensors
p297
aVcan be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.
p298
aVThis drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,
p299
aVwhich gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.
p300
aVThat is quite sufficient for most
p301
aVof our conservation applications.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, conservation drones began as
p304
aVa crazy idea from two biologists
p305
aVwho are just deeply passionate about this technology.
p306
aVAnd we believe, strongly believe,
p307
aVthat drones can and will be a game changer
p308
aVfor conservation research and applications.
p309
aVWe've had our fair share of skeptics and critics
p310
aVwho thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes.
p311
aVAnd in a way, they are right.
p312
aVI mean, let's be honest,
p313
aVdrones are the ultimate toys for boys.
p314
aVBut at the same time, we've also gotten to know
p315
aVmany wonderful colleagues and collaborators
p316
aVwho share our vision
p317
aVand see the potential of conservation drones.
p318
aVTo us, it is obvious that conservation biologists
p319
aVand practitioners should make full use
p320
aVof every available tool, including drones,
p321
aVin our fight to save the last remaining forests
p322
aVand wildlife of this planet.
p323
aa(lp324
VThank you.
