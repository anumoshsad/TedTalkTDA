VIt's a great honor to be here with you.
p4
aVThe good news is
p5
aVI'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here
p6
aVbecause I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVAnd the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,
p9
aVbut I have a box of slides.
p10
aVI have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.
p11
aVI've learned through experience
p12
aVthat people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,
p13
aVand so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures
p14
aVI'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe whole story really starts
p17
aVwith me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
p18
aVin a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.
p19
aVAnd on a Wednesday afternoon,
p20
aVI was walking down the corridor of my high school
p21
aVkind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,
p22
aVwho made a great big old ceramic vessel,
p23
aVand I happened to be looking in the door of the art room \u2014
p24
aVand if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic \u2014
p25
aVand I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.
p26
aVSo, I walked in the art room and I said, "What is that?"
p27
aVAnd he said, "Ceramics. And who are you?"
p28
aVAnd I said, "I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that."
p29
aVAnd he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper
p30
aVthat says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you."
p31
aVAnd so for the remaining two years of my high school,
p32
aVI cut all my classes.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVBut I had the presence of mind
p35
aVto give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVand they gave me passing grades.
p38
aVAnd that's how I got out of high school.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd Mr. Ross said,
p41
aV"You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,
p42
aVso I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me."
p43
aVAnd he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh
p44
aVwhere I filled out a college application and got in on probation.
p45
aVWell, I'm now a trustee of the university,
p46
aVand at my installation ceremony I said,
p47
aV"I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood
p48
aVwho got into the place on probation.
p49
aVDon't give up on the poor kids, because you never know
p50
aVwhat's going to happen to those children in life."
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes
p53
aVis a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh
p54
aVwith the highest crime rate.
p55
aVOne is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school
p56
aVfor ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.
p57
aVYou remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?
p58
aVWell, we don't make any steel anymore,
p59
aVand the people who used to make the steel
p60
aVare having a very tough time of it.
p61
aVAnd I rebuild them and give them new life.
p62
aa(lp63
VManchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.
p64
aVI was adopted
p65
aVby the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,
p66
aVand he donated a row house. And in that row house
p67
aVI started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,
p68
aVand I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,
p69
aVthere's money in very close proximity.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVAnd the Bishop adopted me as his kid.
p72
aVAnd last year I spoke at his memorial service
p73
aVand wished him well in this life.
p74
aVI went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,
p75
aVand I asked him to build me a world class center
p76
aVin the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
p77
aVAnd my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.
p78
aVAnd when you come to Pittsburgh \u2014 and you're all invited \u2014
p79
aVyou'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.
p80
aVThat's the building.
p81
aVBuilt in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.
p82
aa(lp83
VMy view is that if you want to involve yourself
p84
aVin the life of people who have been given up on,
p85
aVyou have to look like the solution and not the problem.
p86
aVAs you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.
p87
aVAnd the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one
p88
aVand I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVAnd now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,
p91
aVI got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.
p92
aVAt a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain
p93
aVbecause they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.
p94
aVWell, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids
p95
aVand ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.
p96
aVAnd so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime
p97
aVis water that greets you \u2014 water is life and water of human possibility \u2014
p98
aVand it sets an attitude and expectation
p99
aVabout how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.
p100
aVSo, from that fountain I built this building.
p101
aa(lp102
VAs you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste
p103
aVbecause I raised all the money.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVI said to my boy, "When you raise the money,
p106
aVwe'll put your taste on the wall."
p107
aVThat we have quilts and clay and calligraphy
p108
aVand everywhere your eye turns,
p109
aVthere's something beautiful looking back at you,
p110
aVthat's deliberate.
p111
aVThat's intentional.
p112
aVIn my view, it is this kind of world
p113
aVthat can redeem the soul of poor people.
p114
aa(lp115
VWe also created a boardroom,
p116
aVand I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,
p117
aVand commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.
p118
aVWe have since spun him off into his own business.
p119
aVHe's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.
p120
aVAnd I got 60 pieces out of it for my school
p121
aVbecause I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers
p122
aVand single parents deserved to come to a school
p123
aVwhere there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.
p124
aVBecause it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people
p125
aVlong before you give them the speech.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.
p128
aVThose are real and they're in my building every day.
p129
aVAnd now that I've given lots of speeches,
p130
aVwe had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,
p131
aVand they said, "Mr. Strickland,
p132
aVwhat an extraordinary story and what a great school.
p133
aVAnd we were particularly touched by the flowers
p134
aVand we were curious as to how the flowers got there."
p135
aVI said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse
p136
aVand I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there."
p137
aVYou don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.
p138
aVWhat you need to know is that the children
p139
aVand the adults deserve flowers in their life.
p140
aVThe cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.
p141
aVAnd so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,
p142
aVwe believe in hope and human possibilities.
p143
aVThat happens to be at Christmas time.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen
p146
aVthat was built by the Heinz company \u2014 you've heard of them?
p147
aVThey did all right in the ketchup business.
p148
aVAnd I happen to know that company pretty well
p149
aVbecause John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator \u2014
p150
aVwho was tragically killed in a plane accident \u2014
p151
aVhe had heard about my desire to build a new building,
p152
aVbecause I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag
p153
aVand I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.
p154
aVAnd he called me into his office \u2014
p155
aVwhich is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz
p156
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p157
aVand John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.
p158
aVAnd he said, "But we've heard about you.
p159
aVWe've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,
p160
aVand we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.
p161
aVAnd you could do us a great service
p162
aVif you would add a culinary program to your program."
p163
aVBecause back then, we were building a trades program.
p164
aVHe said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals
p165
aVfor the Heinz company."
p166
aVI said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field
p167
aVthat I don't know much about, but I promise you
p168
aVthat if you'll support my school, I'll get it built
p169
aVand in a couple of years, I'll come back
p170
aVand weigh out that program that you desire."
p171
aVAnd Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,
p172
aV"Well, what would your reaction be
p173
aVif I said I'd give you a million dollars?"
p174
aVI said, "Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business."
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVAnd John Heinz did give me a million bucks.
p177
aVAnd most importantly,
p178
aVhe loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.
p179
aVAnd we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,
p180
aVwhich in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,
p181
aVand we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers
p182
aVin this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.
p183
aVAnd we've never looked back.
p184
aa(lp185
VI would like to show you now some of the food
p186
aVthat these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.
p187
aVThat happens to be our cafeteria line.
p188
aVThat's puff pastry day. Why?
p189
aVBecause the students made puff pastry
p190
aVand that's what the school ate every day.
p191
aVBut the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.
p192
aVThat good food's not for rich people \u2014
p193
aVgood food's for everybody on the planet,
p194
aVand there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.
p195
aVSo at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program
p196
aVfor welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city
p197
aVbecause we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,
p198
aVbut it's better for their heads.
p199
aVBecause I wanted to let them know every day of their life
p200
aVthat they have value at this place I call my center.
p201
aa(lp202
VWe have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,
p203
aVand what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem
p204
aVby creating a world class environment,
p205
aVbecause people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior
p206
aVif you treat them in that way.
p207
aVThese are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing
p208
aVafter six months in the training program.
p209
aVNo sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.
p210
aVWhat we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people
p211
aVis they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.
p212
aVIt's all in the way that you think about people
p213
aVthat often determines their behavior.
p214
aVThat was done by a student after seven months in the program,
p215
aVdone by a very brilliant young woman
p216
aVwho was taught by our pastry chef.
p217
aVI've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVThey have no calories.
p220
aVThat's our dining room.
p221
aVIt looks like your average high school cafeteria
p222
aVin your average town in America.
p223
aVBut this is my view of how students ought to be treated,
p224
aVparticularly once they have been pushed aside.
p225
aa(lp226
VWe train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,
p227
aVwe train medical technicians for the medical industry,
p228
aVand we train chemical technicians for companies
p229
aVlike Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.
p230
aVAnd I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh \u2014
p231
aVand you're all invited \u2014
p232
aVyou'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry
p233
aVwith logarithmic calculators
p234
aV10 months from enrolling in the program.
p235
aVThere is absolutely no reason why poor people
p236
aVcan't learn world class technology.
p237
aVWhat we've discovered is you have to give them flowers
p238
aVand sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,
p239
aVand you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.
p242
aVWe even teach people how to read.
p243
aVThe kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago \u2014
p244
aVhe's now an instructor.
p245
aVAnd I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.
p246
aVAnd so you must ask yourself the question:
p247
aVhow is it possible in the 21st century
p248
aVthat we graduate children from schools
p249
aVwho can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?
p250
aVThe reason is that the system gets reimbursed
p251
aVfor the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.
p252
aVI can take these children and in 20 weeks,
p253
aVdemonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.
p254
aVNo big deal.
p255
aVThat's our library with more handcrafted furniture.
p256
aVAnd this is the arts program I started in 1968.
p257
aa(lp258
VRemember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.
p259
aVWell, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience
p260
aVwith other kids in the neighborhood,
p261
aVthe theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food
p262
aVand you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,
p263
aVyou can bring them right back to life.
p264
aVI have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system
p265
aVthat come to me every day of the week for arts education.
p266
aVAnd these are children who are flunking out of public school.
p267
aVAnd last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college
p268
aVand I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.
p269
aVWe've made a fascinating discovery:
p270
aVthere's nothing wrong with the kids
p271
aVthat affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm
p272
aVand Herbie's music can't cure.
p273
aVFor that I won a big old plaque \u2014 Man of the Year in Education.
p274
aVI beat out all the Ph.D.'s
p275
aVbecause I figured that if you treat children like human beings,
p276
aVit increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.
p277
aVAnd why we can't institute that policy
p278
aVin every school and in every city and every town
p279
aVremains a mystery to me.
p280
aa(lp281
VLet me show you what these people do.
p282
aVWe have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.
p283
aVAnd these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,
p284
aVno imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists \u2014
p285
aVGordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there \u2014
p286
aVand what we've learned
p287
aVis that the children will become like the people who teach them.
p288
aVIn fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,
p289
aVan African-American woman
p290
aVwho had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,
p291
aVand let me show you what they did with the work.
p292
aVThese were children who the whole world had given up on,
p293
aVwho were flunking out of public school,
p294
aVand that's what they're capable of doing
p295
aVwith affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.
p296
aa(lp297
VWe teach photography.
p298
aVAnd these are examples of some of the kids' work.
p299
aVThat boy won a four-year scholarship
p300
aVon the strength of that photograph.
p301
aVThis is our gallery.
p302
aVWe have a world class gallery
p303
aVbecause we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,
p304
aVso I designed this thing.
p305
aVWe have smoked salmon at the art openings,
p306
aVwe have a formal printed invitation,
p307
aVand I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.
p308
aVI couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago
p309
aVso I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.
p310
aVHe was dragging guys out of bars
p311
aVand saving those lives for the Lord.
p312
aVAnd I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man.
p313
aVYou have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,
p314
aVbut keep the enthusiasm.
p315
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p316
aVI can't get these parents to come to the school."
p317
aVHe said, "I'll get them to come to the school."
p318
aVSo, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,
p319
aV"Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening
p320
aVbut you probably didn't have a ride.
p321
aVSo, I came to give you a ride."
p322
aVAnd he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.
p323
aVAt the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up
p324
aVand we didn't pick up one parent.
p325
aVBecause now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up
p326
aVto support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild
p327
aVbecause people think you're bad parents.
p328
aVAnd there is no statistical difference
p329
aVbetween the white parents and the black parents.
p330
aVMothers will go where their children are being celebrated,
p331
aVevery time, every town, every city.
p332
aVI wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.
p333
aVAnd by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,
p334
aVthey've got four shows on their resume
p335
aVbefore they apply to college because it's all up here.
p336
aa(lp337
VYou have to change the way that people see themselves
p338
aVbefore you can change their behavior.
p339
aVAnd it's worked out pretty good up to this day.
p340
aVI even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.
p341
aVThis is brand new.
p342
aVWe just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.
p343
aVI gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley
p344
aVand I did all right.
p345
aVAnd the woman came out of the audience,
p346
aVshe said, "That was a great story
p347
aVand I was very impressed with your presentation.
p348
aVMy only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old."
p349
aVAnd I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?"
p350
aVShe said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."
p351
aVAnd I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?"
p352
aVShe said, "Yes, sir."
p353
aVAnd I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem."
p354
aVWell, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP
p355
aVand a furniture company called Steelcase
p356
aVhave adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology
p357
aVand all their furniture for the United States of America.
p358
aVAnd that's the room
p359
aVthat's initiating the relationship.
p360
aVWe got it just done in time to show you,
p361
aVso it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aV(Music)
p364
aa(lp365
VI only have a couple more slides,
p366
aVand this is where the story gets kind of interesting.
p367
aVSo, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes
p368
aVand you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.
p369
aVIn 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall
p370
aVon the north end of the building while I was building it.
p371
aVAnd a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there
p372
aVbecause he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.
p373
aVAnd I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check
p374
aVon a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,
p375
aV"Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center
p376
aVin the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate
p377
aVthat doesn't even have a reputation in music?"
p378
aVHe said, "Because I heard you built the center
p379
aVand I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.
p380
aVAnd now that I have, I want to give you a gift."
p381
aVI said, "You're the gift."
p382
aVHe said, "No, sir. You're the gift.
p383
aVAnd I'm going to allow you to record the concert
p384
aVand I'm going to give you the music,
p385
aVand if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement
p386
aVthat says the money will come back and support the school."
p387
aVAnd I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,
p388
aVbut not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.
p389
aVAnd he showed up and said,
p390
aV"Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,
p391
aVand I want to help you."
p392
aVAnd then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.
p393
aVThen a bass player named Ray Brown,
p394
aVand a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,
p395
aVand a piano player named Herbie Hancock,
p396
aVand a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,
p397
aVand a fellow named Tito Puente,
p398
aVand a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,
p399
aVand Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson
p400
aVall have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park
p401
aVto sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.
p402
aVAnd I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,
p403
aVI have now accumulated 600 recordings
p404
aVof the greatest artists in the world,
p405
aVincluding Joe Williams, who died,
p406
aVbut not before his last recording was done at my school.
p407
aVAnd Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder
p408
aVand he said, "God's picked you, man, to do this work.
p409
aVAnd I want my music to be with you."
p410
aVAnd that worked out all right.
p411
aa(lp412
VWhen the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school
p413
aVthey voted to give me the rights to the music.
p414
aVAnd I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.
p415
aVAnd like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony
p416
aVbecause I didn't think we were going to win.
p417
aVWell, we did win,
p418
aVand our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.
p419
aVThen the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them
p420
aVand got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.
p421
aVSo, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios
p422
aVin the United States of America
p423
aV(Laughter)
p424
aVin the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.
p425
aa(lp426
VThat's the place all filled up with Republicans.
p427
aV(Laughter)
p428
aV(Applause)
p429
aVIf you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,
p430
aVyou'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania
p431
aVbecause it was all sitting there.
p432
aVIncluding my mother and father, who lived long enough
p433
aVto see their kid build that building.
p434
aVAnd there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.
p435
aVAnd he was there, Tito Puente.
p436
aVAnd Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there
p437
aVand they recorded with us.
p438
aVAnd that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.
p439
aVWe put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing
p440
aVand that's where we recorded the first Grammy.
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd this is our new facility, which is all video technology.
p443
aVAnd that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,
p444
aVwho recorded that album at our school last Christmas.
p445
aVAnd any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey
p446
aVon Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there
p447
aVsinging excerpts from this album,
p448
aVthe rights to which she donated to our school.
p449
aVAnd I can now tell you with absolute certainty
p450
aVthat an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.
p451
aV(Laughter)
p452
aVWe are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,
p453
aVright behind Tony Bennett.
p454
aVAnd I think we're going to be fine.
p455
aa(lp456
VThis was burned out during the riots \u2014 this is next to my building \u2014
p457
aVand so I had another cardboard box built
p458
aVand I walked back out in the streets again.
p459
aVAnd that's the building, and that's the model,
p460
aVand on the right's a high-tech greenhouse
p461
aVand in the middle's the medical technology building.
p462
aVAnd I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.
p463
aVIt's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot \u2014
p464
aVtriple that in the middle of the inner city.
p465
aVAnd there's the fountain.
p466
aV(Laughter)
p467
aVEvery building has a fountain.
p468
aVAnd the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants
p469
aVand they took half the building,
p470
aVand we now train medical technicians through all their system.
p471
aVAnd Mellon Bank's a tenant.
p472
aVAnd I love them because they pay the rent on time.
p473
aV(Laughter)
p474
aVAnd as a result of the association,
p475
aVI'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation
p476
aVthat bought Dreyfus.
p477
aa(lp478
VAnd this is in the process of being built as we speak.
p479
aVMultiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse
p480
aVthat's going to open in October this year
p481
aVbecause we're going to grow those flowers
p482
aVin the middle of the inner city.
p483
aVAnd we're going to have high school kids
p484
aVgrowing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.
p485
aVAnd we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers
p486
aVto sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.
p487
aVAnd our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,
p488
aVwho are Hispanic.
p489
aVSo, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership
p490
aVto grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.
p491
aVAnd I told my United States senator
p492
aVthat there was a very high probability
p493
aVthat if he could find some funding for this,
p494
aVwe would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,
p495
aVto which he readily agreed.
p496
aVAnd we got the funding and we open in the fall.
p497
aVAnd you ought to come and see it \u2014 it's going to be a hell of a story.
p498
aa(lp499
VAnd this is what I want to do when I grow up.
p500
aV(Laughter)
p501
aVThe brown building is the one you guys have been looking at
p502
aVand I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.
p503
aVI had a chance to buy this whole industrial park \u2014
p504
aVwhich is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront \u2014
p505
aVfor four million dollars and I didn't do it.
p506
aVAnd I built the first building, and guess what happened?
p507
aVI appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations
p508
aVand the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,
p509
aVand said, "Mr. Strickland,
p510
aVyou ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award
p511
aVbecause you've appreciated our property values
p512
aVbeyond our wildest expectations.
p513
aVThank you very much for that."
p514
aVThe moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,
p515
aVjust in case they do come true.
p516
aa(lp517
VAnd finally, there's this picture.
p518
aVThis is in a place called San Francisco.
p519
aVAnd the reason this picture's in here is
p520
aVI did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,
p521
aVand there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.
p522
aVHe said, "Man, that's a great story.
p523
aVI want one of those."
p524
aVI said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?"
p525
aVHe says, "I run the city of San Francisco.
p526
aVMy name's Willie Brown."
p527
aVAnd so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise
p528
aVand put it out of my mind.
p529
aVAnd that weekend, I was going back home
p530
aVand Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night \u2014
p531
aVfirst time I'd met him.
p532
aVAnd he walked in and he says, "What is this?"
p533
aVAnd I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center
p534
aVfor poor people."
p535
aVAnd he said, "As God as my witness,
p536
aVI've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.
p537
aVAnd now I really want to build one."
p538
aVI said, "Well, where would you build this thing?"
p539
aVHe said, "San Francisco."
p540
aVI said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?"
p541
aV(Laughter)
p542
aVAs a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,
p543
aVand Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,
p544
aVand we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.
p545
aVAnd Willie Brown said, "As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,
p546
aVI'm going to build this thing
p547
aVas a legacy to the poor people of this city."
p548
aVAnd he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay
p549
aVand we got an architect and we got a general contractor
p550
aVand we got Herbie on the board,
p551
aVand our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,
p552
aVand our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo
p553
aVand Genentech.
p554
aa(lp555
VAnd along the way, I met this real short guy
p556
aVat my slide show in the Silicon Valley.
p557
aVHe came up to me afterwards,
p558
aVhe said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.
p559
aVI want to help you."
p560
aVAnd I said, "Well, thank you very much for that.
p561
aVWhat do you do for a living?"
p562
aVHe said, "Well, I built a company called eBay."
p563
aVI said, "Well, that's very nice.
p564
aVThanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk."
p565
aVI didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,
p566
aVbut I had the presence of mind to go back
p567
aVand talk to one of the techie kids at my center.
p568
aVI said, "Hey man, what is eBay?"
p569
aVHe said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network."
p570
aVI said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing
p571
aVand he left me his card."
p572
aVSo, I called him up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Skoll,
p573
aVI've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
p574
aV(Laughter)
p575
aVand I'd like to become your friend."
p576
aV(Laughter)
p577
aVAnd Jeff and I did become friends,
p578
aVand he's organized a team of people
p579
aVand we're going to build this center.
p580
aa(lp581
VAnd I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,
p582
aVand I said, "The mayor sent me down here to work with you
p583
aVand I want to build a center with you,
p584
aVbut I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.
p585
aVAnd all I've got is a box of slides."
p586
aVAnd so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people
p587
aVon a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken
p588
aVand it was 100 degrees outside,
p589
aVand I started showing these pictures.
p590
aVAnd after about 10 pictures they all settled down.
p591
aVAnd I ran the story and I said, "What do you think?"
p592
aVAnd in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,
p593
aV"In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,
p594
aVyou're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.
p595
aVI'm going with you, man."
p596
aVAnd she turned that audience around on a pin.
p597
aVAnd I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,
p598
aVand we're going to build it all right.
p599
aVAnd I think we can get in the ground this year
p600
aVas the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.
p601
aa(lp602
VBut I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way
p603
aVand I showed him the box of slides.
p604
aVAnd Quincy said, "I want to help you, man.
p605
aVLet's do one in L.A."
p606
aVAnd so he's assembled a group of people.
p607
aVAnd I've fallen in love with him,
p608
aVas I have with Herbie and with his music.
p609
aVAnd Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"
p610
aVAnd I said, "It came from your music, man.
p611
aVBecause Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums
p612
aVwhen I was 16 years old in the pottery class,
p613
aVwhen the world was all dark,
p614
aVand your music got me to the sunlight."
p615
aVAnd I said, "If I can follow that music,
p616
aVI'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.
p617
aVAnd if that's not true, how did I get here?"
p618
aa(lp619
VI want you all to know
p620
aVthat I think the world is a place that's worth living.
p621
aVI believe in you.
p622
aVI believe in your hopes and your dreams,
p623
aVI believe in your intelligence
p624
aVand I believe in your enthusiasm.
p625
aVAnd I'm tired of living like this,
p626
aVgoing into town after town with people standing around on corners
p627
aVwith holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.
p628
aVWe won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.
p629
aVIn Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,
p630
aVmost of whom look like me.
p631
aVIt's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.
p632
aVIt's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.
p633
aVDo the math \u2014 it will never work.
p634
aVI am banking on you
p635
aVand I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard
p636
aVand very decent people who still believe in something.
p637
aVAnd I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.
p638
aVAnd I don't think I'm crazy.
p639
aVI think we can get home on this thing
p640
aVand I think we can build these all over the country
p641
aVfor less money than we're spending on prisons.
p642
aVAnd I believe we can turn this whole story around
p643
aVto one of celebration and one of hope.
p644
aVIn my business it's very difficult work.
p645
aVYou're always fighting upstream like a salmon \u2014
p646
aVnever enough money, too much need \u2014
p647
aVand so there is a tendency
p648
aVto have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.
p649
aVAnd so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:
p650
aVyou make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.
p651
aVAnd my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.
p652
aVAnd thanks for listening to what I had to say.
