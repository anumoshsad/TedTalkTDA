p1
(lp2
(lp3
VSo, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman.
p4
aVAnd years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of,
p5
aVcalled "The Graduate."
p6
aVAnd there's two key scenes in that movie.
p7
aVThe first one is the seduction scene.
p8
aVI'm not going to talk about that tonight.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VThe second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool,
p13
aVand as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word,
p14
aVjust one word.
p15
aVAnd of course, all of you know what that word is.
p16
aVIt's "plastics."
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VLet me tell you why it was so wrong.
p25
aVThe word should have been "silicon."
p26
aVAnd the reason it should have been silicon
p27
aVis because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made,
p28
aVhad already been filed,
p29
aVand they were already building them.
p30
aVSo Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967,
p31
aVwhen this movie was released.
p32
aVAnd the year after the movie was released,
p33
aVIntel was founded.
p34
aVSo had the graduate heard the right one word,
p35
aVmaybe he would have ended up onstage \u2014 oh, I don't know \u2014
p36
aVmaybe with these two.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo as you're thinking of that,
p41
aVlet's see what bit of advice we might want to give
p42
aVso that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VSo in 2015, what word of advice would you give people,
p47
aVwhen you took a college graduate out by the pool
p48
aVand you said one word, just one word?
p49
aVI think the answer would be "lifecode."
p50
aVSo what is "lifecode?"
p51
aVLifecode is the various ways we have of programming life.
p52
aVSo instead of programming computers,
p53
aVwe're using things to program viruses
p54
aVor retroviruses or proteins
p55
aVor DNA or RNA
p56
aVor plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures.
p57
aVAnd as you're thinking about this incredible ability
p58
aVto make life do what you want it to do,
p59
aVwhat it's programmed to do,
p60
aVwhat you end up doing
p61
aVis taking what we've been doing for thousands of years,
p62
aVwhich is breeding, changing,
p63
aVmixing, matching
p64
aVall kinds of life-forms,
p65
aVand we accelerate it.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd this is not something new.
p68
aVThis humble mustard weed has been modified
p69
aVso that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli.
p70
aVAnd if you change it in a second way, you get kale.
p71
aVAnd if you change it in a third way,
p72
aVyou get cauliflower.
p73
aVSo when you go to these all-natural, organic markets,
p74
aVyou're really going to a place
p75
aVwhere people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time.
p76
aVThe difference today,
p77
aVto pick a completely politically neutral term \u2014
p78
aa(lp79
V[Intelligent design]
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VWe're beginning to practice intelligent design.
p84
aVThat means that instead of doing this at random
p85
aVand seeing what happens over generations,
p86
aVwe're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins,
p87
aVand we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes.
p88
aVAnd that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.
p89
aa(lp90
VLet me just give you one example.
p91
aVSome of you occasionally might think about sex.
p92
aVAnd we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex.
p93
aVSo we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it.
p94
aVWhat's happened with sex over time is \u2014
p95
aVnormally, sex equals baby, eventually.
p96
aVBut in today's world,
p97
aVsex plus pill equals no baby.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural,
p102
aVbut that has not been the case for most of human history.
p103
aVAnd it's not the case for animals.
p104
aVWhat it is does is it gives us control,
p105
aVso sex becomes separate from conception.
p106
aVAnd as you're thinking of the consequences of that,
p107
aVthen we've been playing with stuff
p108
aVthat's a little bit more advanced, like art.
p109
aVNot in the sense of painting and sculpture,
p110
aVbut in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies.
p111
aVSo what are assisted reproductive technologies?
p112
aVAssisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization.
p113
aVAnd when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it.
p114
aVSometimes you just can't conceive otherwise.
p115
aVBut when you do that,
p116
aVwhat you\u2019re doing is separating sex, conception, baby.
p117
aVSo you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby,
p118
aVyou've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized.
p119
aVSo you've separated the baby
p120
aVfrom the body from the act.
p121
aVAnd as you're thinking of other things we've been doing,
p122
aVthink about twins.
p123
aVSo you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs,
p124
aVyou can freeze fertilized eggs.
p125
aVAnd what does that mean?
p126
aVWell, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient.
p127
aVYou're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation,
p128
aVso you save these things.
p129
aVYou don't irradiate them.
p130
aVBut if you can save them and you can freeze them,
p131
aVand you can have a surrogate mother,
p132
aVit means that you've decoupled sex from time.
p133
aVIt means you can have twins born \u2014 oh, in 50 years?
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VIn a hundred years?
p138
aVTwo hundred years?
p139
aVAnd these are three really profound changes
p140
aVthat are not, like, future stuff.
p141
aVThis is stuff we take for granted today.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower.
p144
aVIt turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses,
p145
aVof changing plants, of changing animals,
p146
aVperhaps even of evolving ourselves.
p147
aVIt's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.
p148
aa(lp149
VLet's have some risks.
p150
aVLike every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile,
p151
aVlike computers, this stuff potentially can be misused.
p152
aVAnd that scares a lot of people.
p153
aVAnd as you apply these technologies,
p154
aVyou can even turn human beings into chimeras.
p155
aVRemember the Greek myth where you mix animals?
p156
aVWell, some of these treatments
p157
aVactually end up changing your blood type.
p158
aVOr they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa,
p159
aVwhich sounds absolutely horrible
p160
aVuntil you realize, the reason you're doing that
p161
aVis you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments.
p162
aVSo by taking somebody else's bone marrow,
p163
aVyou may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself,
p164
aVbut you're also saving your life.
p165
aVAnd as you're thinking about this stuff,
p166
aVhere's something that happened 20 years ago.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis is Emma Ott.
p169
aVShe's a recent college admittee.
p170
aVShe's studying accounting.
p171
aVShe played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian.
p172
aVAnd that's not particularly extraordinary,
p173
aVexcept that she's the first human being born to three parents.
p174
aVWhy?
p175
aVBecause she had a deadly mitochondrial disease
p176
aVthat she might have inherited.
p177
aVSo when you swap out a third person's DNA
p178
aVand you put it in there,
p179
aVyou save the lives of people.
p180
aVBut you also are doing germline engineering,
p181
aVwhich means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved
p182
aVand won't go through this.
p183
aVAnd [their] kids will be saved,
p184
aVand their grandchildren will be saved,
p185
aVand this passes on.
p186
aa(lp187
VThat makes people nervous.
p188
aVSo 20 years ago, the various authorities said,
p189
aVwhy don't we study this for a while?
p190
aVThere are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff,
p191
aVbecause there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology,
p192
aVand then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years.
p193
aVSo as we think about it,
p194
aVas we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies,
p195
aVmaybe we should do this, maybe we should do that,"
p196
aVthere are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting.
p197
aVLike curing deadly diseases \u2014
p198
aVwhich, by the way, is completely unnatural.
p199
aVIt is normal and natural for humans to be felled
p200
aVby massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis.
p201
aVWhen we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things
p202
aVinto their body
p203
aVbecause we think the benefit outweighs the risk.
p204
aVBecause we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals,
p205
aVwe can feed about seven billion people.
p206
aVWe can do things like create new life-forms.
p207
aVAnd as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary
p208
aVand terribly bothersome,
p209
aVuntil you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table.
p210
aVThose flowers you've got on your dining room table \u2014
p211
aVthere's not a lot that's natural about them,
p212
aVbecause people have been breeding the flowers to make this color,
p213
aVto be this size, to last for a week.
p214
aVYou don't usually give your loved one wildflowers
p215
aVbecause they don't last a whole lot of time.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhat all this does
p218
aVis it flips Darwin completely on his head.
p219
aVSee, for four billion years,
p220
aVwhat lived and died on this planet depended on two principles:
p221
aVon natural selection and random mutation.
p222
aVAnd so what lived and died, what was structured,
p223
aVhas now been flipped on its head.
p224
aVAnd what we've done
p225
aVis created this completely parallel evolutionary system
p226
aVwhere we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo let me explain these things.
p229
aVThis is natural selection.
p230
aVThis is unnatural selection.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VSo what happens with this stuff is,
p235
aVwe started breeding wolves thousands of years ago
p236
aVin central Asia to turn them into dogs.
p237
aVAnd then we started turning them into big dogs
p238
aVand into little dogs.
p239
aVBut if you take one of the chihuahuas
p240
aVyou see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue
p241
aVand you let it loose on the African plain,
p242
aVyou can watch natural selection happen.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VFew things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield.
p247
aVYou will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest
p248
aVand see the same plant growing in orderly rows
p249
aVat the same time,
p250
aVnothing else living there.
p251
aVWhen you do a cornfield,
p252
aVyou're selecting what lives and what dies.
p253
aVAnd you're doing that through unnatural selection.
p254
aVIt's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field.
p255
aVIt's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb.
p256
aVIn fact, half the surface of Earth
p257
aVhas been unnaturally engineered
p258
aVso that what lives and what dies there is what we want,
p259
aVwhich is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears
p260
aVwalking through downtown Manhattan.
p261
aa(lp262
VHow about this random mutation stuff?
p263
aVWell, this is random mutation.
p264
aVThis is Antonio Alfonseca.
p265
aVHe's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname.
p266
aVHe was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000.
p267
aVAnd he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers
p268
aVon each hand,
p269
aVwhich turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VHow about non-random mutation?
p274
aVA non-random mutation is beer.
p275
aVIt's wine. It's yogurt.
p276
aVHow many times have you walked through the forest
p277
aVand found all-natural cheese?
p278
aVOr all-natural yogurt?
p279
aVSo we've been engineering this stuff.
p280
aVNow, the interesting thing is,
p281
aVwe get to know the stuff better.
p282
aVWe found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments,
p283
aVCRISPR, inside yogurt.
p284
aVAnd as we start engineering cells,
p285
aVwe're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products,
p286
aVincluding the stuff that you use to treat arthritis,
p287
aVwhich is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo this lifecode stuff.
p290
aVIt really is a superpower.
p291
aVIt really is a way of programming stuff,
p292
aVand there's nothing that's going to change us
p293
aVmore than this lifecode.
p294
aVSo as you're thinking of lifecode,
p295
aVlet's think of five principles
p296
aVas to how we start guiding,
p297
aVand I'd love you to give me more.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo, principle number one:
p300
aVwe have to take responsibility for this stuff.
p301
aVThe reason we have to take responsibility
p302
aVis because we're in charge.
p303
aVThese aren't random mutations.
p304
aVThis is what we are doing, what we are choosing.
p305
aVIt's not, "Stuff happened."
p306
aVIt didn't happen at random.
p307
aVIt didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else.
p308
aVWe engineer this stuff,
p309
aVand it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.
p310
aa(lp311
VPrinciple number two:
p312
aVwe have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff.
p313
aVThere have been at least 33 versions of hominids
p314
aVthat have walked around this Earth.
p315
aVMost all of them went extinct except us.
p316
aVBut the normal and natural state of this Earth
p317
aVis we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time,
p318
aVwhich is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us.
p319
aVSome of us have some Denisova in us.
p320
aVAnd some in Washington have a lot more of it.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VPrinciple number three:
p325
aVwe have to respect other people's choices.
p326
aVSome people will choose to never alter.
p327
aVSome people will choose to alter all.
p328
aVSome people will choose to alter plants but not animals.
p329
aVSome people will choose to alter themselves.
p330
aVSome people will choose to evolve themselves.
p331
aVDiversity is not a bad thing,
p332
aVbecause even though we think of humans as very diverse,
p333
aVwe came so close to extinction
p334
aVthat all of us descend from a single African mother
p335
aVand the consequence of that
p336
aVis there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees
p337
aVthan there are in seven billion humans.
p338
aa(lp339
VPrinciple number four:
p340
aVwe should take about a quarter of the Earth
p341
aVand only let Darwin run the show there.
p342
aVIt doesn't have to be contiguous,
p343
aVdoesn't have to all be tied together.
p344
aVIt should be part in the oceans, part on land.
p345
aVBut we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet.
p346
aVWe want to have our evolutionary system running.
p347
aVWe want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running.
p348
aVAnd it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel
p349
aVand not overwhelm evolution.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VLast thing I'll say.
p354
aVThis is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on.
p355
aVThis is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had.
p356
aVIt would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff
p357
aVbecause you're scared of it,
p358
aVbecause you're hiding from it.
p359
aVYou can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics.
p360
aVYou can participate in the business.
p361
aVYou can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going,
p362
aVwhere industry is going,
p363
aVwhere we're going to take the world.
p364
aVIt would be a crime for all of us
p365
aVnot to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool
p366
aVand says one word, just one word,
p367
aVif you don't listen if that word is "lifecode."
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you very much.
