VI collaborate with bacteria.
p4
aVAnd I'm about to show you
p5
aVsome stop-motion footage that I made recently
p6
aVwhere you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals
p7
aVfrom their environment
p8
aVover the period of an hour.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo what you're seeing here
p11
aVis the bacteria metabolizing,
p12
aVand as they do so
p13
aVthey create an electrical charge.
p14
aVAnd this attracts metals
p15
aVfrom their local environment.
p16
aVAnd these metals accumulate as minerals
p17
aVon the surface of the bacteria.
p18
aa(lp19
VOne of the most pervasive problems
p20
aVin the world today for people
p21
aVis inadequate access
p22
aVto clean drinking water.
p23
aVAnd the desalination process
p24
aVis one where we take out salts.
p25
aVWe can use it for drinking and agriculture.
p26
aVRemoving the salts from water \u2014
p27
aVparticularly seawater \u2014
p28
aVthrough reverse osmosis
p29
aVis a critical technique
p30
aVfor countries who do not have access to clean drinking water
p31
aVaround the globe.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo seawater reverse osmosis
p34
aVis a membrane-filtration technology.
p35
aVWe take the water from the sea
p36
aVand we apply pressure.
p37
aVAnd this pressure forces the seawater
p38
aVthrough a membrane.
p39
aVThis takes energy,
p40
aVproducing clean water.
p41
aVBut we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut the process is very expensive
p44
aVand it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.
p45
aVAnd also, the brine that's produced
p46
aVis oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.
p47
aVAnd this is detrimental to the local ecology
p48
aVof the sea area that it's pumped back out into.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo I work in Singapore at the moment,
p51
aVand this is a place that's really a leading place
p52
aVfor desalination technology.
p53
aVAnd Singapore proposes by 2060
p54
aVto produce [900] million liters per day
p55
aVof desalinated water.
p56
aVBut this will produce an equally massive amount
p57
aVof desalination brine.
p58
aVAnd this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo what we're doing at the moment
p61
aVis we're accumulating metals
p62
aVlike calcium, potassium and magnesium
p63
aVfrom out of desalination brine.
p64
aVAnd this, in terms of magnesium
p65
aVand the amount of water that I just mentioned,
p66
aVequates to a $4.5 billion
p67
aVmining industry for Singapore \u2014
p68
aVa place that doesn't have any natural resources.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I'd like you to image a mining industry
p71
aVin a way that one hasn't existed before;
p72
aVimagine a mining industry
p73
aVthat doesn't mean defiling the Earth;
p74
aVimagine bacteria helping us do this
p75
aVby accumulating and precipitating
p76
aVand sedimenting minerals
p77
aVout of desalination brine.
p78
aVAnd what you can see here
p79
aVis the beginning of an industry in a test tube,
p80
aVa mining industry that is in harmony with nature.
p81
aa(lp82
VThank you.
