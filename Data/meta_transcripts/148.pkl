VThis is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
p4
aVThe punch line?
p5
aV"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four
p6
aVevery single morning to milk my Labrador."
p7
aVThis is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
p8
aVBest hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,
p9
aVbirths, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
p10
aVAnd this is a song medley I put together \u2014
p11
aa(lp12
V(Music)
p13
aa(lp14
VDid you ever notice that four in the morning has become
p15
aVsome sort of meme or shorthand?
p16
aVIt means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VA time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.
p21
aVA time for plotting to whack the chief of police,
p22
aVlike in this classic scene from "The Godfather."
p23
aVCoppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.
p24
aVIt is four in the morning."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VA time for even grimmer stuff than that,
p29
aVlike autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's
p30
aV"The House of the Spirits."
p31
aVAfter the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,
p32
aVthe doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.
p33
aVThey worked until four o'clock in the morning.
p34
aa(lp35
VA time for even grimmer stuff than that,
p36
aVlike in last April's New Yorker magazine.
p37
aVThis short fiction piece by Martin Amis
p38
aVstarts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes
p39
aVat 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,
p40
aVand Mohamed Atta's last day began."
p41
aVFor a time that I find to be the most placid
p42
aVand uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets
p43
aVan awful lot of bad press \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
Vacross a lot of different media from a lot of big names.
p48
aVAnd it made me suspicious.
p49
aVI figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,
p50
aVaren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope
p51
aVlike they invented it, right?
p52
aVCould it be there is something more going on here?
p53
aVSomething deliberate, something secret,
p54
aVand who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?
p55
aVI say this guy \u2014 Alberto Giacometti, shown here
p56
aVwith some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.
p57
aVHe did it with this famous piece
p58
aVfrom the New York Museum of Modern Art.
p59
aVIts title \u2014 "The Palace at Four in the Morning \u2014
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
V1932.
p64
aVNot just the earliest cryptic reference
p65
aVto four in the morning I can find.
p66
aVI believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture
p67
aVmay provide an incredible key to virtually
p68
aVevery artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.
p69
aVI call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
p70
aVNo, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries
p71
aVor your iPhones if you've got them.
p72
aa(lp73
VIt works a little something like \u2014 this is a recent Google search
p74
aVfor four in the morning.
p75
aVResults vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
p76
aVThe top 10 results yield you
p77
aVfour hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"
p78
aVthree hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"
p79
aVone hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."
p80
aVBut what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,
p81
aVa country music hall of famer all have in common
p82
aVbesides this totally excellent Google ranking?
p83
aa(lp84
VWell, let's start with Faron Young \u2014 who was born incidentally
p85
aVin 1932.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VIn 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth \u2014
p90
aVwhich incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBut he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
p95
aVHe languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed
p96
aVto a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 \u2014
p97
aVwhich incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.
p98
aa(lp99
VWhere was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
p100
aVShe has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.
p101
aVOn that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,
p102
aVFaron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,
p103
aVMs. Four in the Morning \u2014 or one of them anyway \u2014 Wislawa Szymborska
p104
aVwas in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.
p105
aV100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.
p106
aVCoincidence? No, it's creepy.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VCoincidence to me has a much simpler metric.
p111
aVThat's like me telling you,
p112
aV"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,
p113
aVwhich coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"
p114
aVNo, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,
p115
aVbut that does not mean there's not something going on
p116
aVat the highest possible levels.
p117
aVIn fact there are people in this room
p118
aVwho may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VVideo: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room \u2014
p123
aVYou mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,
p124
aVyour guy will fry them up?
p125
aa(lp126
VHerbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.
p127
aVNow do you need towels, laundry, maids?
p128
aa(lp129
VHS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait \u2014 let me see if I got this straight.
p130
aVIt is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
p131
aVThere's a rumble in my stomach.
p132
aa(lp133
VMarge Simpson: Homer, please.
p134
aa(lp135
VRives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
p136
aVLet me see if I got this straight, Matt.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VWhen Homer Simpson needs to imagine
p141
aVthe most remote possible moment of not just the clock,
p142
aVbut the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400
p143
aVon the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
p144
aVAnd no, I don't know how it works
p145
aVinto the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously
p146
aVI know a coded message when I see one.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VI said, I know a coded message when I see one.
p151
aVAnd folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life"
p152
aVfrom the bookstore here at TED.
p153
aVParse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.
p154
aVOr you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.
p155
aVAnd how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll
p156
aVto get to the golden ticket?
p157
aVWould you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
p158
aVThis is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:
p159
aV"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied
p160
aVwith the inaugural address.
p161
aVMy speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out
p162
aVbecause as we worked between one and four in the morning
p163
aVon Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
p164
aa(lp165
VSure you were, because you've prepared your entire life
p166
aVfor this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
p167
aVAnd then \u2014
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
Vthree paragraphs later we get this little beauty:
p172
aV"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
p173
aVIt had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
p174
aVWell, how could it have?
p175
aVBy his own writing, this man was either asleep,
p176
aVat a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch
p177
aVa nuclear missile out of a suitcase.
p178
aVWhat happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?
p179
aVWhat happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
p180
aVWe might not ever know.
p181
aVAnd I noticed, he's not exactly around here today
p182
aVto face any tough questions.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VIt could get awkward, right?
p187
aVI mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
p188
aVBut if he were here \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
Vhe might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,
p193
aVthat on this day Bill Clinton began a journey \u2014
p194
aVa journey that saw him go on to become
p195
aVthe first Democrat president elected
p196
aVto two consecutive terms in decades.
p197
aVIn generations.
p198
aVThe first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
p199
aVwho began his own unprecedented journey
p200
aVway back at his own first election,
p201
aVway back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 \u2014
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
Vthe year Alberto Giacometti
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
Vmade "The Palace at Four in the Morning."
p209
aVThe year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,
p210
aVfirst came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.
