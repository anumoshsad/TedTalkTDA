VThank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here
p4
aVsaid they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,
p5
aVbut this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
p6
aVAnd I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
p7
aVThere are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories
p11
aVand talk about a different Africa.
p12
aVAlready this morning there were some allusions to the Africa
p13
aVthat you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,
p14
aVthe Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,
p15
aVand the Africa of disasters.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhile it is true that those things are going on,
p18
aVthere's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
p19
aVAnd sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
p20
aVThis is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
p21
aVThis is the Africa of opportunity.
p22
aVThis is the Africa where people want to take charge of
p23
aVtheir own futures and their own destinies.
p24
aVAnd this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships
p25
aVto do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I want to start by telling you
p28
aVa story about that change in Africa.
p29
aVOn 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,
p30
aVa governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,
p31
aVwas arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
p32
aVHe was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars
p33
aVthat went into some dormant accounts
p34
aVthat belonged to him and his family.
p35
aVThis arrest occurred because there was cooperation
p36
aVbetween the London Metropolitan Police
p37
aVand the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria \u2014
p38
aVled by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
p39
aVAlamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
p40
aVDue to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman
p41
aVand ran from London back to Nigeria where,
p42
aVaccording to our constitution, those in office
p43
aVas governors, president \u2014 as in many countries \u2014
p44
aVhave immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:
p45
aVpeople were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible
p46
aVfor his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
p47
aa(lp48
VToday, Alams \u2014 as we call him for short \u2014 is in jail.
p49
aVThis is a story about the fact that people in Africa
p50
aVare no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
p51
aVThis is a story about the fact that people want their resources
p52
aVmanaged properly for their good, and not taken out to places
p53
aVwhere they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
p54
aVAnd therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa \u2014
p55
aVcorruption all the time \u2014 I want you to know that the people
p56
aVand the governments are trying hard to fight this
p57
aVin some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
p58
aa(lp59
VDoes it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
p60
aVThere's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
p61
aVAnd that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
p62
aVSo when you hear about corruption,
p63
aVdon't just feel that nothing is being done about this \u2014
p64
aVthat you can't operate in any African country
p65
aVbecause of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
p66
aVThere's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing
p67
aVand is being won. In others, like mine,
p68
aVwhere there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,
p69
aVthe fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
p72
aVThe results are showing:
p73
aVindependent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations
p74
aVshow that in many instances the trend is downwards
p75
aVin terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
p76
aVA study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed
p77
aVa clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd let me say just one more thing
p80
aVbefore I leave this area of governance.
p81
aVThat is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
p82
aVAll the time when they talk about it
p83
aVyou immediately think about Africa.
p84
aVThat's the image: African countries. But let me say this:
p85
aVif Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London \u2014
p86
aVif the other people who had taken money, estimated at
p87
aV20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies
p88
aVsitting abroad in the developed countries \u2014 if they're able to do this,
p89
aVwhat is that? Is that not corruption?
p90
aVIn this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
p91
aVSo when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think
p92
aVabout what is happening on the other side of the globe \u2014
p93
aVwhere the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
p94
aVI'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,
p95
aVon asset recovery, trying to do what we can
p96
aVto get the monies that have been taken abroad \u2014
p97
aVdeveloping countries' moneys \u2014 to get that sent back.
p98
aVBecause if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,
p99
aVit may be far more for some of these countries
p100
aVthan all the aid that is being put together.
p101
aV(Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VThe second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
p104
aVAfricans, after \u2014 they're tired, we're tired
p105
aVof being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
p106
aVWe are grateful, but we know that
p107
aVwe can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
p108
aVAnd what is happening in many African countries now is a realization
p109
aVthat no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
p110
aVWe can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
p111
aVWe have to reform our economies, change our leadership,
p112
aVbecome more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd this is what we started to do
p115
aVin one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
p116
aVIn fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
p117
aVI want to tell you that.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVOne in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,
p120
aVand it has 140 million dynamic people \u2014 chaotic people \u2014
p121
aVbut very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat we started to do was to realize
p125
aVthat we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
p126
aVAnd with the support of a leader
p127
aVwho was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,
p128
aVwe put forward a comprehensive reform program,
p129
aVwhich we developed ourselves.
p130
aVNot the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,
p131
aVwhere I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
p132
aVNo one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
p133
aa(lp134
VWe put together a program that would, one: get the state
p135
aVout of businesses it had nothing \u2014 it had no business being in.
p136
aVThe state should not be in the business
p137
aVof producing goods and services
p138
aVbecause it's inefficient and incompetent.
p139
aVSo we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aVWe \u2014 as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
p142
aVCan you believe that prior to this reform \u2014
p143
aVwhich started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington
p144
aVto go and take up the post of Finance Minister \u2014
p145
aVwe had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop
p146
aV4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VHaving a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
p150
aVYou couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
p151
aVYou had to do everything to get your phone.
p152
aVWhen President Obasanjo supported and launched
p153
aVthe liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
p154
aVwe went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
p155
aVNigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,
p156
aVafter China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year
p157
aVin telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VThe smartest one, first to come in,
p161
aVwas the MTN company of South Africa.
p162
aVAnd in the three years that I was Finance Minister,
p163
aVthey made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
p164
aV360 million in a market \u2014 in a country that is a poor country,
p165
aVwith an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
p166
aVSo the market is there.
p167
aVWhen they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
p168
aVNigerians themselves began to develop
p169
aVsome wireless telecommunications companies,
p170
aVand three or four others have come in.
p171
aVBut there's a huge market out there,
p172
aVand people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
p173
aVSo privatization is one of the things we've done.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
p176
aVBecause nobody's going to help you and support you
p177
aVif you're not managing your own finances well.
p178
aVAnd Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation
p179
aVof being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
p180
aVSo what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule
p181
aVthat de-linked our budget from the oil price.
p182
aVBefore we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,
p183
aVbecause oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector
p184
aVin the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
p185
aVWe de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget
p186
aVat a price slightly lower than the oil price
p187
aVand save whatever was above that price.
p188
aVWe didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
p189
aVBut what it immediately did was that the volatility
p190
aVthat had been present in terms of our economic development \u2014
p191
aVwhere, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
p192
aVWhen they crashed, we crashed.
p193
aVAnd we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
p194
aVThat smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,
p195
aV27 billion dollars. Whereas \u2014 and this went to our reserves \u2014
p196
aVwhen I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
p197
aVBy the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And
p198
aVas we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves
p199
aVdue to proper management of our finances.
p200
aVAnd that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
p201
aa(lp202
VOur exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time
p203
aVis now fairly stable and being managed so that business people
p204
aVhave a predictability of prices in the economy.
p205
aVWe brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
p206
aVAnd we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade
p207
aVto about 6.5 percent now.
p208
aVSo all the changes and reforms we were able to make
p209
aVhave shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd what is more important, because we want to get away from oil
p212
aVand diversify \u2014 and there are so many opportunities
p213
aVin this one big country, as in many countries in Africa \u2014
p214
aVwhat was remarkable is that much of this growth came
p215
aVnot from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
p216
aVAgriculture grew at better than eight percent.
p217
aVAs telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,
p218
aVand I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that
p219
aVonce you get the macro-economy straightened out,
p220
aVthe opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
p221
aa(lp222
VWe have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
p223
aVWe have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals
p224
aVthat no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized
p225
aVthat without the proper legislation to make that possible,
p226
aVthat wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code
p227
aVthat is comparable with some of the best in the world.
p228
aVWe have opportunities in housing and real estate.
p229
aVThere was nothing in a country of 140 million people \u2014
p230
aVno shopping malls as you know them here.
p231
aVThis was an investment opportunity for someone
p232
aVthat excited the imagination of people.
p233
aVAnd now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall
p234
aVare doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo, huge things in construction, real estate,
p237
aVmortgage markets. Financial services:
p238
aVwe had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
p239
aVWe consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring
p240
aVthat they increase their capital \u2014 share capital.
p241
aVAnd it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
p242
aVThe banks \u2014 these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening
p243
aVof the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
p244
aVBarclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
p245
aVStandard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
p246
aVAnd I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
p247
aa(lp248
VWe are doing the same with the insurance sector.
p249
aVSo in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
p250
aVIn tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
p251
aVAnd that's what many people know East Africa for:
p252
aVthe wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
p253
aVBut managing the tourism market in a way
p254
aVthat can really benefit the people is very important.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you
p257
aVthat there's a new wave on the continent.
p258
aVA new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,
p259
aVmore than two-thirds of African countries have had
p260
aVmulti-party democratic elections.
p261
aVNot all of them have been perfect, or will be,
p262
aVbut the trend is very clear.
p263
aVI'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,
p264
aVthe average rate of growth on the continent has moved
p265
aVfrom about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
p266
aVThis is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
p267
aVSo it's clear that things are changing.
p268
aa(lp269
VConflicts are down on the continent;
p270
aVfrom about 12 conflicts a decade ago,
p271
aVwe are down to three or four conflicts \u2014
p272
aVone of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
p273
aVAnd, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where
p274
aVif something is going on in one part of the continent,
p275
aVit looks like the entire continent is affected.
p276
aVBut you should know that this continent is not \u2014
p277
aVis a continent of many countries, not one country.
p278
aVAnd if we are down to three or four conflicts,
p279
aVit means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest
p280
aVin stable, growing, exciting economies
p281
aVwhere there's plenty of opportunity.
p282
aVAnd I want to just make one point about this investment.
p283
aa(lp284
VThe best way to help Africans today
p285
aVis to help them to stand on their own feet.
p286
aVAnd the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
p287
aVThere's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that
p288
aVand saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
p289
aVBut imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed
p290
aVand make sure that their children go to school,
p291
aVthat they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
p292
aVIf we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
p293
aVwhilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,
p294
aVisn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
p295
aVAnd I want to say that some of the best people to invest in
p296
aVon the continent are the women.
p297
aV(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VI have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
p300
aVOtherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
p301
aVIt says, "Africa: Open for Business."
p302
aVAnd this is a video that has actually won an award
p303
aVas the best documentary of the year.
p304
aVUnderstand that the woman who made it
p305
aVis going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
p306
aVBut it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who
p307
aVagainst all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
p308
aa(lp309
VOne of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,
p310
aVmaking children's clothes \u2014
p311
aVwhich she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
p312
aVMixing African materials, such as we have,
p313
aVwith materials from elsewhere.
p314
aVSo, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,
p315
aVwith African material mixed in. Very creative designs,
p316
aVhas reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVFor 10,000 pieces.
p319
aVSo that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
p322
aVI could go on giving examples:
p323
aVBeatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business
p324
aVand is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning
p325
aVand is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
p326
aVHowever, many of these are starved for capital to expand,
p327
aVbecause nobody believes outside of our countries
p328
aVthat we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
p329
aVNobody thinks there's opportunity.
p330
aVBut I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,
p331
aVwill miss it forever.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
p334
aVThink about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,
p335
aVwho are doing incredible things, that are bringing them
p336
aVinto the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure
p337
aVthat their fellow men and women are employed,
p338
aVand that the children in those households get educated
p339
aVbecause their parents are earning adequate income.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo I invite you to explore the opportunities.
p342
aVWhen you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,
p343
aVbecause I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be
p344
aVfor you to get involved in something that will do good
p345
aVfor the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
p346
aa(lp347
VThank you very much.
