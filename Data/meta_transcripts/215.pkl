VI draw to better understand things.
p4
aVSometimes I make a lot of drawings
p5
aVand I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
p6
aVThose of you who are comfortable with digital stuff
p7
aVand even smug about that relationship might be amused to know
p8
aVthat the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"
p9
aVwhile preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,
p10
aVspent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
p11
aVWho knew about extension managers?
p12
aVI've always managed my own extensions
p13
aVso it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,
p14
aVbut I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,
p15
aVbecause along with the invitation
p16
aVcame the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,
p17
aVso bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary
p18
aVbut some alternate form of communication would.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, I could talk about something that I'm known for,
p21
aVsomething that would be particularly appropriate
p22
aVfor many of the more technically minded people here,
p23
aVor I could talk about something I really care about.
p24
aVI decided to go with the latter.
p25
aVI'm going to talk about Rome.
p26
aVNow, why would I care about Rome, particularly?
p27
aVWell, I went to Rhode Island School of Design
p28
aVin the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
p29
aVI was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,
p30
aVin Rome as a student. It changed my life.
p31
aVNot the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,
p32
aVdriving into RISD everyday, driving back.
p33
aVI missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter)
p34
aVI understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,
p35
aVbut I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,
p36
aVand it's a place that is never far from my mind.
p37
aVSo, whenever given an opportunity,
p38
aVI try to do something in it or with it or for it.
p39
aa(lp40
VI also make drawings to help people understand things.
p41
aVThings that I want them to believe I understand.
p42
aVAnd that's what I do as an illustrator,
p43
aVthat's my job.
p44
aVSo, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
p45
aVI've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
p46
aVThese are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible \u2014
p47
aVI need to.
p48
aVAll different materials, all different styles, all different times,
p49
aVdrawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
p50
aVPart of the reason I'm showing you these
p51
aVis that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through
p52
aVof trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
p53
aa(lp54
VThese are sketches of some of the little details.
p55
aVRome is a city full of surprises.
p56
aVI mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,
p57
aVwe're talking about narrow little winding streets
p58
aVthat suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas \u2014
p59
aVnever, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.
p60
aVPart of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
p61
aVThat amazing juxtaposition of old and new,
p62
aVthe bits of light that come down between the buildings
p63
aVthat sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of
p64
aVusually blue \u2014 especially in the summer \u2014
p65
aVcompared to the map that you would normally expect to see
p66
aVof conventional streets.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
p69
aVHow could I share my sense of Rome,
p70
aVmy understanding of Rome?
p71
aVAnd I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
p72
aVThe primary reason for all these dead ends is when
p73
aVif you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there
p74
aVwith any kind of efficiency.
p75
aa(lp76
VHere's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;
p77
aVmaybe I should just try and do a little atlas
p78
aVof my favorite streets and connections in Rome.
p79
aVAnd here's a line of text that actually evolves
p80
aVfrom the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
p81
aVHere that same line of text wraps around a fountain
p82
aVin an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
p83
aVMaybe that line of text could be a story
p84
aVto help give some human aspect to this.
p85
aVMaybe I should get away from this map completely,
p86
aVand really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome
p87
aVand simply kick a soccer ball in the air \u2014
p88
aVwhich happens in so many of the squares in the city \u2014
p89
aVand let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain
p90
aVwhat each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
p91
aVThat seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
p92
aVBut even though I just started this presentation,
p93
aVthis is not the first thing that I tried to do
p94
aVand I was getting sort of desperate.
p95
aa(lp96
VEventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,
p97
aVso I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter)
p98
aVI mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
p99
aVSo I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
p100
aVBut one of the ideas that emerged
p101
aVfrom some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome
p102
aVin different vehicles at different speeds in order
p103
aVto show the different aspects of Rome.
p104
aVSort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
p105
aVQuick snapshots of things you might see
p106
aVfrom a speeding motor scooter, and very slow
p107
aVwalking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail
p108
aVsome of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.
p111
aVWent to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
p112
aVFound one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions
p113
aVso I could actually use it as a scale
p114
aVthat I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
p115
aVThis thing would be flying over or past
p116
aVor be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler \u2014
p117
aVsort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
p118
aVNot that you know how long number 11 actually is,
p119
aVbut you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon
p120
aVwith number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,
p121
aVand so on and so forth. If you were interested.
p122
aa(lp123
VThis is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,
p124
aVshe has purchased a dirigible \u2014 a small dirigible \u2014
p125
aVshe's assembling the structure,
p126
aVAjax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
p127
aVShe launches this thing above the Spanish Steps
p128
aVand sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
p129
aVOver the Spanish Steps we go.
p130
aVA nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
p131
aVUnfortunately, just across the road from it
p132
aVor quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
p133
aVand the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,
p134
aVas you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around
p135
aVthe Column of Marcus Aurelius \u2014 gets a little too close, nudges it.
p136
aVThis gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure
p137
aVof the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
p138
aVwhich is really no more than a pile of quarters
p139
aVhigh \u2014 thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,
p140
aVcompletely ruining the symmetry, but that aside
p141
aVa spectacular place to visit.
p142
aVA spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,
p143
aVextraordinary blue sky.
p144
aVOver the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.
p145
aVShe parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope
p146
aVand climbs down for a closer look inside.
p147
aVThe text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced
p148
aVto turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view
p149
aVand from her point of view \u2014 looking in the hole,
p150
aVgetting a different kind of perspective,
p151
aVmoving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building
p152
aVthat can contain perfectly a sphere
p153
aVdimensions of the diameter being the same
p154
aVas the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
p155
aa(lp156
VUnfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled
p157
aVaround the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,
p158
aVand they are immediately yanked out
p159
aVand given an extraordinary but terrifying tour
p160
aVof some of the domes of Rome, which would,
p161
aVfrom their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
p162
aVThey bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,
p163
aVthat little spiral structure you see there.
p164
aVShe continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
p165
aVNotices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,
p166
aVis reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
p167
aVThey keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,
p168
aVwhich they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket
p169
aVand lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,
p170
aVwhich flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,
p171
aVand then is completely removed
p172
aVand doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
p173
aVAnyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
p174
aVUnfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,
p175
aVAjax makes a lunge for it.
p176
aVShe's managed to save the prosciutto,
p177
aVbut in the process she loses the tablecloth,
p178
aVwhich you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
p179
aVThey continue without their tablecloth,
p180
aVlooking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
p181
aVThey eventually discover a huge wall
p182
aVthat's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible
p183
aVbecause you've got a place to tie up.
p184
aVTurns out to be the exterior wall \u2014
p185
aVthat part of it that remains \u2014 of the Coliseum,
p186
aVso they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch
p187
aVand have a spectacular view.
p188
aa(lp189
VAt the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off
p190
aVthrough the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city
p191
aVand then an abandoned gatehouse
p192
aVand decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,
p193
aVwhich has this lightning rod on top.
p194
aVUnfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,
p195
aVand when you're in a dirigible
p196
aVyou have to be very careful about spikes.
p197
aVSo that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
p198
aVMarcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,
p199
aVbut he's not due at work until about noon.
p200
aVSo, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
p201
aVHe gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city
p202
aVpast the church of Santa Maria della Pace,
p203
aVdown the alleys, through the streets
p204
aVthat tourists may be wandering through,
p205
aVdisturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
p206
aVThat speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,
p207
aVwhich, again, can be turned around and read from both sides
p208
aVbecause there's text on the bottom and text on the top,
p209
aVone of which is upside down in this image.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter
p212
aVwho is trying to deliver two plates of linguine
p213
aVin a delicate white wine clam sauce
p214
aVto diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
p215
aVWaiter catches on, but it's too late.
p216
aVAnd Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.
p217
aVEverything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,
p218
aVbut keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
p219
aVRemoves some scaffolding. One of the reasons
p220
aVRome remains the extraordinary place it is that
p221
aVbecause of scaffolding and the determination
p222
aVto maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues
p223
aVto grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time
p224
aVin which it finds itself, or we find it.
p225
aVRight through the Piazza della Rotonda,
p226
aVin front of the Pantheon \u2014 again wreaking havoc \u2014 and finally getting to work.
p227
aVMarcello, as it turns out,
p228
aVis the driver of the number 64 bus,
p229
aVand if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know
p230
aVthat it's driven with the same kind of exuberance
p231
aVas Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
p234
aVHe's looking at his table;
p235
aVhe's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter)
p236
aVand he wants it to be perfect.
p237
aVHe's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle
p238
aVand he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
p239
aVBut he's not happy; something's wrong.
p240
aVThe phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
p241
aVHe saunters \u2014 he saunters at a good clip,
p242
aVbut as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
p243
aVEverybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,
p244
aVactually; he's in television.
p245
aVHe's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
p246
aVSo they all have his number.
p247
aVHe arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
p248
aVEnters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,
p249
aVwho tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;
p250
aVnobody's TVs are working
p251
aVand there's a big soccer game coming up,
p252
aVand the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
p253
aa(lp254
VHe goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,
p255
aVand then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,
p256
aVapartment by apartment, checking every television,
p257
aVchecking every connection,
p258
aVhoping to find out what this problem is.
p259
aVHe works his way up, finally, the grand staircase
p260
aVand then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
p261
aVHe opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth
p262
aVwrapped around the building's television antenna.
p263
aVHe removes it, the problems are solved,
p264
aVeverybody in the palazzo is happy.
p265
aVAnd of course, he also solves his own problem.
p266
aVAll he has to do now, with a perfect table,
p267
aVis wait for her to arrive.
p268
aa(lp269
VThat was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough
p270
aVto convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
p271
aVSo I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,
p272
aVand I'll get inside and underneath
p273
aVand I'll show these things growing
p274
aVand show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
p275
aVAnd then I thought, that's too complicated. No,
p276
aVI'll just take my favorite bits and pieces
p277
aVand I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,
p278
aVso you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius
p279
aVand the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
p280
aVNow that's one drawing,
p281
aVso I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VYou see that I'm beginning to really lose control here
p284
aVand also hope.
p285
aVThere's a very thin blue line of exhaust
p286
aVthat sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
p287
aVThen I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
p288
aVA book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,
p289
aVit's a series of layers.
p290
aVI mean, you always peel one layer off another;
p291
aVwe think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
p292
aVBut think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers \u2014
p293
aVhorizontal layers, vertical layers \u2014
p294
aVand I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to \u2014
p295
aVif I got you thinking about it the right way \u2014
p296
aVwould allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
p297
aVThe stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome
p298
aVcovers the scars; the scars of centuries of change
p299
aVas these structures have been adapted
p300
aVrather than being torn down.
p301
aVIf I do a foldout page on the left-hand side
p302
aVand let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
p303
aVYou can see that in 1635,
p304
aVit became essential to make smaller windows
p305
aVbecause the bad guys were coming or whatever.
p306
aVAdaptations all get buried under the stucco.
p307
aVI could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
p308
aVBut more importantly, I could also show you
p309
aVwhat it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings
p310
aVwith all the massive stone blocks,
p311
aVor the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,
p312
aVwhich is more often the case.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
p315
aVI could take you down one of those narrow little streets
p316
aVinto one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold \u2014
p317
aVdouble foldout page \u2014 which, if you were like me
p318
aVreading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
p319
aVYou wrap the pages around your head
p320
aVand are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
p321
aVAnd I've really not done anything much more complicated
p322
aVthan make foldout pages.
p323
aVBut then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
p324
aVLet's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
p325
aVHere's a book completely wide open.
p326
aVOK, if I don't open the book the whole way,
p327
aVif I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,
p328
aVand we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
p329
aVAnd if I turn the book the other way,
p330
aVwe're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
p331
aVNo foldouts, no tricks \u2014
p332
aVjust a book that isn't open the whole way.
p333
aVThat seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside
p334
aVand I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
p335
aVSo we get inside the Pantheon
p336
aVand it grows and so on and so forth.
p337
aVAnd I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,
p338
aVbut it sort of lost its human quality.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo I went back to the notion of story,
p341
aVwhich is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people
p342
aVto pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
p343
aV"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.
p344
aVIf it was a homing pigeon,
p345
aVit would be called "Homer's Odyssey."
p346
aVBut it was the journey of the ... (Laughter)
p347
aVI mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome
p348
aVand showed all the things that I like about Rome.
p349
aVIt's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
p350
aVGoes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,
p351
aVthe whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting
p352
aVand there's no way this pigeon can get home.
p353
aVSo it's a homeless pigeon now
p354
aVand it's going to have to find another place to live,
p355
aVand that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,
p356
aVand we start with the tall ones and so on.
p357
aVMaybe it has to go back and live with family members;
p358
aVthat's not always a good thing,
p359
aVbut it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
p360
aVAnd I thought, that's sort of interesting,
p361
aVbut maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo I kind of came up with this old guy
p364
aVwho spends his life looking after sick pigeons.
p365
aVHe'll go anywhere to get them \u2014 dangerous places and whatnot \u2014
p366
aVand they become really friends with this guy,
p367
aVand learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
p368
aVThere's a real bond that develops
p369
aVbetween this old man and these pigeons.
p370
aVBut unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
p371
aVHe's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
p372
aVThey show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him \u2014
p373
aVhe lives in this little garret \u2014
p374
aVand they spell his name and fly around.
p375
aVAnd he finally gets enough strength together
p376
aVto climb up the ladder onto the roof,
p377
aVand all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him
p378
aVand they carry him off over the walls of the city.
p379
aVAnd I forgot to mention this:
p380
aVwhenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon
p381
aVout beyond the walls of the city.
p382
aVIn the old Roman custom, the dead
p383
aVwere never buried within the walls.
p384
aVAnd I thought that's a really cheery story.
p385
aV(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work
p388
aVand if the stories aren't going anywhere,
p389
aVI just come up with titles
p390
aVand hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
p391
aVAnd sometimes it does focus me enough
p392
aVand I'll even do a title page.
p393
aVSo, these are all title pages that eventually led me
p394
aVto the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman
p395
aVwho sends a message on a homing pigeon \u2014
p396
aVshe lives outside the walls of the city of Rome \u2014 to someone in the city.
p397
aVAnd the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
p398
aVYou can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
p399
aVIf you see the red line,
p400
aVyou are seeing the trail of the pigeon;
p401
aVif you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
p402
aVAnd it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,
p403
aVto try to convey what that sense would be like
p404
aVof flying over the city without actually moving.
p405
aVPast the Pyramid of Cestius \u2014
p406
aVthese will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently \u2014
p407
aVpast the gatehouse.
p408
aVThis is something that's a little bit unusual.
p409
aVThis pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:
p410
aVit takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device
p411
aVthat I felt was necessary to actually extend this book
p412
aVbeyond about four pages.

VSo, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin
p415
aVand the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
p416
aVWe almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese \u2014
p417
aVdesigned by Michelangelo,
p418
aVbuilt of stone taken from the Coliseum \u2014 narrow escape.
p419
aVWe swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
p420
aVThis is one of those things I show to my students
p421
aVbecause it's a complete bastardization \u2014
p422
aVa denial of any rules of perspective.
p423
aVThe only rule of perspective that I think matters is
p424
aVif it looks believable, you've succeeded.
p425
aVBut you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;
p426
aVa couple are on Mars and
p427
aVa couple of others in Cremona.
p428
aVBut into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,
p429
aVwhere invariably a soccer game is going on,
p430
aVand we're hit by a soccer ball.
p431
aVNow this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
p432
aVI have all the pieces:
p433
aVthere's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,
p434
aVthere's a little bit of a bird's wing \u2014 nothing's happening,
p435
aVso I had to rethink it.
p436
aVAnd if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,
p437
aVthese books are really flexible, incredibly interactive \u2014
p438
aVjust turn it around and look at it the other way.
p439
aa(lp440
VThrough the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
p441
aVAnd then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower \u2014
p442
aVone of the few remaining medieval towers \u2014
p443
aVtowards the church of Sant'Agnese
p444
aVand around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona \u2014
p445
aVwhich we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;
p446
aVthere's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers \u2014
p447
aVand then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,
p448
aVstopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus
p449
aVof the Pantheon to catch our breath.
p450
aVAnd then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,
p451
aVwe don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,
p452
aVso this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
p453
aa(lp454
VWe get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;
p455
aVit's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
p456
aVPast the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;
p457
aVbeautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
p458
aVAnd eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,
p459
aVwhich is our destination.
p460
aVStraight up through the courtyard
p461
aVinto a little window into the attic,
p462
aVwhere somebody is working at the drawing board.
p463
aVHe removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
p464
aVAs we look at the drawing board,
p465
aVwe see what he's working on is, in fact,
p466
aVa map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,
p467
aVand the red line extends through all the sights.
p468
aVAnd if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,
p469
aVall you have to do is read these paragraphs.
p470
aVThank you very much.
