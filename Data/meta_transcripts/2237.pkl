VMy first love was for the night sky.
p4
aVLove is complicated.
p5
aa(lp6
VYou're looking at a fly-through of the  Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,
p7
aVone of the most distant images of our universe ever observed.
p8
aVEverything you see here is a galaxy,
p9
aVcomprised of billions of stars each.
p10
aVAnd the farthest galaxy is  a trillion, trillion kilometers away.
p11
aa(lp12
VAs an astrophysicist, I have the awesome privilege of studying
p13
aVsome of the most exotic objects  in our universe.
p14
aVThe objects that have captivated me  from first crush throughout my career
p15
aVare supermassive,  hyperactive black holes.
p16
aVWeighing one to 10 billion times  the mass of our own sun,
p17
aVthese galactic black holes  are devouring material,
p18
aVat a rate of upwards of  1,000 times more
p19
aVthan your "average"  supermassive black hole.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VThese two characteristics,
p23
aVwith a few others, make them quasars.
p24
aVAt the same time, the objects I study
p25
aVare producing some of the most powerful particle streams
p26
aVever observed.
p27
aVThese narrow streams, called jets,
p28
aVare moving at 99.99 percent  of the speed of light,
p29
aVand are pointed directly at the Earth.
p30
aa(lp31
VThese jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive and supermassive black holes
p32
aVare called blazars, or blazing quasars.
p33
aVWhat makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's
p34
aVmost efficient particle accelerators,
p35
aVtransporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy.
p36
aa(lp37
VHere, I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar.
p38
aVThe dinner plate by which  material falls onto the black hole
p39
aVis called the accretion disc,
p40
aVshown here in blue.
p41
aVSome of that material is slingshotted around the black hole
p42
aVand accelerated to insanely high speeds
p43
aVin the jet, shown here in white.
p44
aVAlthough the blazar system is rare,
p45
aVthe process by which nature pulls in material via a disk,
p46
aVand then flings some of it out via a jet, is more common.
p47
aVWe'll eventually zoom out of  the blazar system
p48
aVto show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context.
p49
aa(lp50
VBeyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out,
p51
aVone of the hot topics in  blazar astrophysics right now
p52
aVis where the highest-energy  jet emission comes from.
p53
aVIn this image, I'm interested in where this white blob forms
p54
aVand if, as a result, there's any  relationship between the jet
p55
aVand the accretion disc material.
p56
aa(lp57
VClear answers to this question
p58
aVwere almost completely inaccessible until 2008,
p59
aVwhen NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light \u2014
p60
aVthat is, light with energies a million times higher
p61
aVthan your standard x-ray scan.
p62
aVI simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data
p63
aVand the visible light data from day to day and year to year,
p64
aVto better localize these gamma ray blobs.
p65
aVMy research shows that in some instances,
p66
aVthese blobs form much closer to the black hole
p67
aVthan we initially thought.
p68
aa(lp69
VAs we more confidently localize
p70
aVwhere these gamma ray  blobs are forming,
p71
aVwe can better understand how jets are being accelerated,
p72
aVand ultimately reveal  the dynamic processes
p73
aVby which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis all started as a love story.
p76
aVAnd it still is.
p77
aVThis love transformed me from  a curious, stargazing young girl
p78
aVto a professional astrophysicist,
p79
aVhot on the heels of celestial discovery.
p80
aVWho knew that chasing after the universe
p81
aVwould ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth.
p82
aVThen again, when do we ever know where love's first flutter
p83
aVwill truly take us.
p84
aa(lp85
VThank you.
