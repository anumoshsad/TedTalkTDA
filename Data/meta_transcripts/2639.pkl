VOur lives depend
p4
aVon a world we can't see.
p5
aVThink about your week so far.
p6
aVHave you watched TV, used GPS,
p7
aVchecked the weather or even ate a meal?
p8
aVThese many things that enable our daily lives
p9
aVrely either directly or indirectly
p10
aVon satellites.
p11
aVAnd while we often take for granted
p12
aVthe services that satellites provide us,
p13
aVthe satellites themselves deserve our attention
p14
aVas they are leaving a lasting mark
p15
aVon the space they occupy.
p16
aa(lp17
VPeople around the world rely on satellite infrastructure every day
p18
aVfor information, entertainment and to communicate.
p19
aVThere's agricultural and environmental monitoring,
p20
aVInternet connectivity, navigation.
p21
aVSatellites even play a role
p22
aVin the operation of our financial and energy markets.
p23
aVBut these satellites that we rely on
p24
aVday in and day out
p25
aVhave a finite life.
p26
aVThey might run out of propellant,
p27
aVthey could malfunction,
p28
aVor they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life.
p29
aVAt this point, these satellites effectively become space junk,
p30
aVcluttering the orbital environment.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo imagine you're driving down the highway on a beautiful, sunny day
p33
aVout running errands.
p34
aVYou've got your music cranked,
p35
aVyour windows rolled down,
p36
aVwith the cool breeze blowing through your hair.
p37
aVFeels nice, right?
p38
aVEverything is going smoothly
p39
aVuntil suddenly your car stutters and stalls
p40
aVright in the middle of the highway.
p41
aVSo now you have no choice but to abandon your car
p42
aVwhere it is on the highway.
p43
aVMaybe you were lucky enough
p44
aVto be able to move it out of the way and into a shoulder lane
p45
aVso that it's out of the way of other traffic.
p46
aVA couple of hours ago,
p47
aVyour car was a useful machine that you relied on in your everyday life.
p48
aVNow, it's a useless hunk of metal
p49
aVtaking up space in a valuable transportation network.
p50
aVAnd imagine international roadways all cluttered with broken down vehicles
p51
aVthat are just getting in the way of other traffic.
p52
aVAnd imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere
p53
aVif a collision actually happened,
p54
aVthousands of smaller pieces of debris
p55
aVbecoming new obstacles.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis is the paradigm of the satellite industry.
p58
aVSatellites that are no longer working
p59
aVare often left to deorbit over many, many years,
p60
aVor only moved out of the way as a temporary solution.
p61
aVAnd there are no international laws in space
p62
aVto enforce us to clean up after ourselves.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,
p65
aVwas launched in 1957,
p66
aVand in that year, there were only a total of three launch attempts.
p67
aVDecades later and dozens of countries from all around the world
p68
aVhave launched thousands of more satellites into orbit,
p69
aVand the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future,
p70
aVespecially if you consider things like the possibility
p71
aVof 900-plus satellite constellations being launched.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, we send satellites to different orbits
p74
aVdepending on what they're needed for.
p75
aVOne of the most common places we send satellites
p76
aVis the low Earth orbit,
p77
aVpossibly to image the surface of Earth
p78
aVat up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.
p79
aVSatellites there are naturally buffeted by Earth's atmosphere,
p80
aVso their orbits naturally decay,
p81
aVand they'll eventually burn up,
p82
aVprobably within a couple of decades.
p83
aVAnother common place we send satellites
p84
aVis the geostationary orbit
p85
aVat about 35,000 kilometers altitude.
p86
aVSatellites there remain in the same place above Earth as the Earth rotates,
p87
aVwhich enables things like communications or television broadcast, for example.
p88
aVSatellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries.
p89
aVAnd then there's the orbit coined "the graveyard,"
p90
aVthe ominous junk or disposal orbits,
p91
aVwhere some satellites are intentionally placed
p92
aVat the end of their life
p93
aVso that they're out of the way of common operational orbits.
p94
aa(lp95
VOf the nearly 7,000 satellites launched since the late 1950s,
p96
aVonly about one in seven is currently operational,
p97
aVand in addition to the satellites that are no longer working,
p98
aVthere's also hundreds of thousands of marble-sized debris
p99
aVand millions of paint chip-sized debris
p100
aVthat are also orbiting around the Earth.
p101
aVSpace debris is a major risk to space missions,
p102
aVbut also to the satellites that we rely on each and every day.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, because space debris and junk has become increasingly worrisome,
p105
aVthere have been some national and international efforts
p106
aVto develop technical standards
p107
aVto help us limit the generation of additional debris.
p108
aVSo for example, there are recommendations
p109
aVfor those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft
p110
aVto be made to deorbit in under 25 years,
p111
aVbut that's still a really long time,
p112
aVespecially if a satellite hasn't been working for years.
p113
aVThere's also mandates for those dead geostationary spacecraft
p114
aVto be moved into a graveyard orbit.
p115
aVBut neither of these guidelines is binding under international law,
p116
aVand the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms.
p117
aVThese guidelines are also not long-term,
p118
aVthey're not proactive,
p119
aVnor do they address the debris that's already up there.
p120
aVThey're only in place to limit the future creation of debris.
p121
aVSpace junk is no one's responsibility.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, Mount Everest is actually an interesting comparison
p124
aVof a new approach to how we interact with our environments,
p125
aVas it's often given the dubious honor
p126
aVof being the world's highest garbage dump.
p127
aVDecades after the first conquest of the world's highest peak,
p128
aVtons of rubbish left behind by climbers
p129
aVhas started to raise concern,
p130
aVand you may have read in the news that there's speculation
p131
aVthat Nepal will crack down on mountaineers
p132
aVwith stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations.
p133
aVThe goal, of course, is to persuade climbers
p134
aVto clean up after themselves,
p135
aVso maybe local not-for-profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste,
p136
aVor expeditions might organize voluntary cleanup trips.
p137
aVAnd yet still many climbers feel
p138
aVthat independent groups should police themselves.
p139
aVThere's no simple or easy answer,
p140
aVand even well-intentioned efforts at conservation
p141
aVoften run into problems.
p142
aVBut that doesn't mean we shouldn't do everything in our power
p143
aVto protect the environments that we rely and depend on,
p144
aVand like Everest, the remote location and inadequate infrastructure
p145
aVof the orbital environment
p146
aVmake waste disposal a challenging problem.
p147
aVBut we simply cannot reach new heights
p148
aVand create an even higher garbage dump,
p149
aVone that's out of this world.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe reality of space
p152
aVis that if a component on a satellite breaks down,
p153
aVthere really are limited opportunities for repairs,
p154
aVand only at great cost.
p155
aVBut what if we were smarter about how we designed satellites?
p156
aVWhat if all satellites,
p157
aVregardless of what country they were built in,
p158
aVhad to be standardized in some way
p159
aVfor recycling, servicing
p160
aVor active deorbiting?
p161
aVWhat if there actually were international laws with teeth
p162
aVthat enforced end-of-life disposal of satellites
p163
aVinstead of moving them out of the way
p164
aVas a temporary solution?
p165
aVOr maybe satellite manufacturers need to be charged a deposit
p166
aVto even launch a satellite into orbit,
p167
aVand that deposit would only be returned
p168
aVif the satellite was disposed of properly
p169
aVor if they cleaned up some quota of debris.
p170
aVOr maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board
p171
aVto help accelerate deorbit.
p172
aa(lp173
VThere are some encouraging signs.
p174
aVThe UK's TechDemoSat-1, launched in 2014, for example,
p175
aVwas designed for end-of-life disposal
p176
aVvia a small drag sail.
p177
aVThis works for the satellite because it's small,
p178
aVbut satellites that are higher or in larger orbits
p179
aVor are larger altogether, like the size of school buses,
p180
aVwill require other disposal options.
p181
aVSo maybe you get into things like high-powered lasers
p182
aVor tugging using nets or tethers,
p183
aVas crazy as those sound in the short term.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd then one really cool possibility
p186
aVis the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics.
p187
aVImagine if a robotic arm
p188
aVon some sort of space tow truck
p189
aVcould fix the broken components on a satellite,
p190
aVmaking them usable again.
p191
aVOr what if that very same robotic arm
p192
aVcould refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft
p193
aVthat relies on chemical propulsion
p194
aVjust like you or I would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars?
p195
aVRobotic repair and maintenance
p196
aVcould extend the lives of hundreds of satellites orbiting around the Earth.
p197
aa(lp198
VWhatever the disposal or cleanup options we come up with,
p199
aVit's clearly not just a technical problem.
p200
aVThere's also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out.
p201
aVSimply put, we haven't found a way to use space sustainably yet.
p202
aa(lp203
VExploring, innovating to change the way we live and work
p204
aVare what we as humans do,
p205
aVand in space exploration,
p206
aVwe're literally moving beyond the boundaries of Earth.
p207
aVBut as we push thresholds in the name of learning and innovation,
p208
aVwe must remember that accountability for our environments never goes away.
p209
aVThere is without doubt congestion in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,
p210
aVand we cannot keep launching new satellites
p211
aVto replace the ones that have broken down
p212
aVwithout doing something about them first,
p213
aVjust like we would never leave a broken down car
p214
aVin the middle of the highway.
p215
aVNext time you use your phone,
p216
aVcheck the weather or use your GPS,
p217
aVthink about the satellite technologies that make those activities possible.
p218
aVBut also think about the very impact
p219
aVthat the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth,
p220
aVand help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact.
p221
aa(lp222
VEarth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful
p223
aVand our gateway to exploration.
p224
aVIt's up to us to keep it that way.
