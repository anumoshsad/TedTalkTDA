VI was here four years ago,
p4
aVand I remember, at the time,
p5
aVthat the talks weren't put online.
p6
aVI think they were given to TEDsters in a box,
p7
aVa box set of DVDs,
p8
aVwhich they put on their shelves, where they are now.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said,
p13
aV"We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?"
p14
aVAnd I said, "Sure."
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd four years later,
p17
aVit's been downloaded four million times.
p18
aVSo I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something
p19
aVto get the number of people who've seen it.
p20
aVAnd, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
V(Applause)
p25
aa(lp26
VDon't you feel?
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up
p31
aVto me doing another one for you, so here it is.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAl Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago
p36
aVand talked about the climate crisis.
p37
aVAnd I referenced that at the end of my last talk.
p38
aVSo I want to pick up from there
p39
aVbecause I only had 18 minutes, frankly.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, as I was saying \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VYou see, he's right.
p48
aVI mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously,
p49
aVand I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VBut I believe there is a second climate crisis,
p54
aVwhich is as severe,
p55
aVwhich has the same origins,
p56
aVand that we have to deal with with the same urgency.
p57
aVAnd you may say, by the way,
p58
aV"Look, I'm good.
p59
aVI have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VBut this is a crisis of, not natural resources \u2014
p64
aVthough I believe that's true \u2014
p65
aVbut a crisis of human resources.
p66
aa(lp67
VI believe fundamentally,
p68
aVas many speakers have said during the past few days,
p69
aVthat we make very poor use of our talents.
p70
aVVery many people go through their whole lives
p71
aVhaving no real sense of what their talents may be,
p72
aVor if they have any to speak of.
p73
aVI meet all kinds of people
p74
aVwho don't think they're really good at anything.
p75
aa(lp76
VActually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.
p77
aVJeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher,
p78
aVonce spiked this argument.
p79
aVHe said, "There are two types of people in this world:
p80
aVthose who divide the world into two types
p81
aVand those who do not."
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VWell, I do.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VI meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.
p90
aVThey simply go through their lives getting on with it.
p91
aVThey get no great pleasure from what they do.
p92
aVThey endure it rather than enjoy it,
p93
aVand wait for the weekend.
p94
aVBut I also meet people
p95
aVwho love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
p96
aVIf you said, "Don't do this anymore,"
p97
aVthey'd wonder what you're talking about.
p98
aVIt isn't what they do, it's who they are.
p99
aVThey say, "But this is me, you know.
p100
aVIt would be foolish to abandon this,
p101
aVbecause it speaks to my most authentic self."
p102
aVAnd it's not true of enough people.
p103
aVIn fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.
p104
aVAnd I think there are many possible explanations for it.
p105
aVAnd high among them is education,
p106
aVbecause education, in a way,
p107
aVdislocates very many people from their natural talents.
p108
aVAnd human resources are like natural resources;
p109
aVthey're often buried deep.
p110
aVYou have to go looking for them,
p111
aVthey're not just lying around on the surface.
p112
aVYou have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.
p113
aVAnd you might imagine education would be the way that happens,
p114
aVbut too often, it's not.
p115
aVEvery education system in the world is being reformed at the moment
p116
aVand it's not enough.
p117
aVReform is no use anymore,
p118
aVbecause that's simply improving a broken model.
p119
aVWhat we need \u2014
p120
aVand the word's been used many times in the past few days \u2014
p121
aVis not evolution,
p122
aVbut a revolution in education.
p123
aVThis has to be transformed into something else.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VOne of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education.
p128
aVInnovation is hard,
p129
aVbecause it means doing something that people don't find very easy,
p130
aVfor the most part.
p131
aVIt means challenging what we take for granted,
p132
aVthings that we think are obvious.
p133
aVThe great problem for reform or transformation
p134
aVis the tyranny of common sense.
p135
aVThings that people think,
p136
aV"It can't be done differently, that's how it's done."
p137
aa(lp138
VI came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln,
p139
aVwho I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VHe said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress.
p144
aVI ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.
p145
aVWe don't teach American history in Britain.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VWe suppress it. You know, this is our policy.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VNo doubt, something fascinating was happening then,
p154
aVwhich the Americans among us will be aware of.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut he said this:
p157
aV"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.
p158
aVThe occasion is piled high with difficulty,
p159
aVand we must rise with the occasion."
p160
aVI love that.
p161
aVNot rise to it, rise with it.
p162
aV"As our case is new,
p163
aVso we must think anew and act anew.
p164
aVWe must disenthrall ourselves,
p165
aVand then we shall save our country."
p166
aa(lp167
VI love that word, "disenthrall."
p168
aVYou know what it means?
p169
aVThat there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to,
p170
aVwhich we simply take for granted as the natural order of things,
p171
aVthe way things are.
p172
aVAnd many of our ideas have been formed,
p173
aVnot to meet the circumstances of this century,
p174
aVbut to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.
p175
aVBut our minds are still hypnotized by them,
p176
aVand we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.
p177
aVNow, doing this is easier said than done.
p178
aVIt's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.
p179
aVAnd the reason is that you take it for granted.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VLet me ask you something you may take for granted.
p184
aVHow many of you here are over the age of 25?
p185
aVThat's not what you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that.
p186
aVAre there any people here under the age of 25?
p187
aVGreat. Now, those over 25,
p188
aVcould you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch?
p189
aVNow that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
p190
aVAsk a room full of teenagers the same thing.
p191
aVTeenagers do not wear wristwatches.
p192
aVI don't mean they can't,
p193
aVthey just often choose not to.
p194
aVAnd the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture,
p195
aVthose of us over 25.
p196
aVAnd so for us, if you want to know the time,
p197
aVyou have to wear something to tell it.
p198
aVKids now live in a world which is digitized,
p199
aVand the time, for them, is everywhere.
p200
aVThey see no reason to do this.
p201
aVAnd by the way, you don't need either;
p202
aVit's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.
p203
aVMy daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.
p204
aVShe doesn't see the point.
p205
aVAs she says,
p206
aV"It's a single-function device."
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
V"Like, how lame is that?"
p211
aVAnd I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
V"It has multiple functions."
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VBut, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.
p220
aVA couple of examples.
p221
aVOne of them is the idea of linearity:
p222
aVthat it starts here and you go through a track
p223
aVand if you do everything right,
p224
aVyou will end up set for the rest of your life.
p225
aVEverybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly,
p226
aVor sometimes explicitly, a different story:
p227
aVthat life is not linear; it's organic.
p228
aVWe create our lives symbiotically
p229
aVas we explore our talents
p230
aVin relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.
p231
aVBut, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.
p232
aVAnd probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college.
p233
aVI think we are obsessed with getting people to college.
p234
aVCertain sorts of college.
p235
aVI don't mean you shouldn't go, but not everybody needs to go,
p236
aVor go now.
p237
aVMaybe they go later, not right away.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing.
p240
aVThere was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.
p241
aVI said, "What do you do?"
p242
aVAnd he said, "I'm a fireman."
p243
aVI asked, "How long have you been a fireman?"
p244
aV"Always. I've always been a fireman."
p245
aV"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid.
p246
aVActually, it was a problem for me at school,
p247
aVbecause at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VHe said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."
p252
aVAnd he said, "When I got to the senior year of school,
p253
aVmy teachers didn't take it seriously.
p254
aVThis one teacher didn't take it seriously.
p255
aVHe said I was throwing my life away
p256
aVif that's all I chose to do with it;
p257
aVthat I should go to college, I should become a professional person,
p258
aVthat I had great potential
p259
aVand I was wasting my talent to do that."
p260
aVHe said, "It was humiliating.
p261
aVIt was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful.
p262
aVBut it's what I wanted, and as soon as I left school,
p263
aVI applied to the fire service and I was accepted.
p264
aVYou know, I was thinking about that guy recently,
p265
aVjust a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher,
p266
aVbecause six months ago, I saved his life."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VHe said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,
p271
aVand I saved his wife's life as well."
p272
aVHe said, "I think he thinks better of me now."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
V(Applause)
p277
aa(lp278
VYou know, to me,
p279
aVhuman communities depend upon a diversity of talent,
p280
aVnot a singular conception of ability.
p281
aVAnd at the heart of our challenges \u2014
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VAt the heart of the challenge
p286
aVis to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.
p287
aVThis linearity thing is a problem.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhen I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago,
p290
aVI came across a policy statement \u2014
p291
aVvery well-intentioned \u2014
p292
aVwhich said, "College begins in kindergarten."
p293
aVNo, it doesn't.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VIt doesn't.
p298
aVIf we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VKindergarten begins in kindergarten.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VA friend of mine once said,
p307
aV"A three year-old is not half a six year-old."
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VThey're three.
p314
aa(lp315
VBut as we just heard in this last session,
p316
aVthere's such competition now to get into kindergarten \u2014
p317
aVto get to the right kindergarten \u2014
p318
aVthat people are being interviewed for it at three.
p319
aVKids sitting in front of unimpressed panels,
p320
aVyou know, with their resumes \u2014
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VFlicking through and saying, "What, this is it?"
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
V"You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?"
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
V"You've achieved nothing \u2014 commit.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VSpent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see."
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VSee, it's outrageous as a conception.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe other big issue is conformity.
p345
aVWe have built our education systems on the model of fast food.
p346
aVThis is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.
p347
aVThere are two models of quality assurance in catering.
p348
aVOne is fast food, where everything is standardized.
p349
aVThe other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants,
p350
aVwhere everything is not standardized,
p351
aVthey're customized to local circumstances.
p352
aVAnd we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education,
p353
aVand it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies
p354
aVas much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VWe have to recognize a couple of things here.
p359
aVOne is that human talent is tremendously diverse.
p360
aVPeople have very different aptitudes.
p361
aVI worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid
p362
aVat about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VIt worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VIn a way \u2014
p371
aVit did not for me.
p372
aVI could not get this thing to work
p373
aVno matter how often or how hard I blew into it.
p374
aVIt just wouldn't work.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VBut it's not only about that.
p379
aVIt's about passion.
p380
aVOften, people are good at things they don't really care for.
p381
aVIt's about passion,
p382
aVand what excites our spirit and our energy.
p383
aVAnd if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,
p384
aVtime takes a different course entirely.
p385
aVMy wife's just finished writing a novel,
p386
aVand I think it's a great book,
p387
aVbut she disappears for hours on end.
p388
aVYou know this, if you're doing something you love,
p389
aVan hour feels like five minutes.
p390
aVIf you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit,
p391
aVfive minutes feels like an hour.
p392
aVAnd the reason so many people are opting out of education
p393
aVis because it doesn't feed their spirit,
p394
aVit doesn't feed their energy or their passion.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo I think we have to change metaphors.
p397
aVWe have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education,
p398
aVa manufacturing model,
p399
aVwhich is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.
p400
aVWe have to move to a model
p401
aVthat is based more on principles of agriculture.
p402
aVWe have to recognize
p403
aVthat human flourishing is not a mechanical process;
p404
aVit's an organic process.
p405
aVAnd you cannot predict the outcome of human development.
p406
aVAll you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions
p407
aVunder which they will begin to flourish.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo when we look at reforming education and transforming it,
p410
aVit isn't like cloning a system.
p411
aVThere are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.
p412
aVThere are many great models.
p413
aVIt's about customizing to your circumstances
p414
aVand personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching.
p415
aVAnd doing that, I think, is the answer to the future
p416
aVbecause it's not about scaling a new solution;
p417
aVit's about creating a movement in education
p418
aVin which people develop their own solutions,
p419
aVbut with external support based on a personalized curriculum.
p420
aa(lp421
VNow in this room,
p422
aVthere are people who represent extraordinary resources in business,
p423
aVin multimedia, in the Internet.
p424
aVThese technologies,
p425
aVcombined with the extraordinary talents of teachers,
p426
aVprovide an opportunity to revolutionize education.
p427
aVAnd I urge you to get involved in it
p428
aVbecause it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children.
p429
aVBut we have to change from the industrial model
p430
aVto an agricultural model,
p431
aVwhere each school can be flourishing tomorrow.
p432
aVThat's where children experience life.
p433
aVOr at home, if that's what they choose,
p434
aVto be educated with their families or friends.
p435
aa(lp436
VThere's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days.
p437
aVAnd I wanted to just very quickly \u2014
p438
aVI was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,
p439
aVrecovering old poems.
p440
aVI wanted to read you a quick, very short poem
p441
aVfrom W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know.
p442
aVHe wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,
p443
aVand he was bewailing the fact
p444
aVthat he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.
p445
aVAnd he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."
p446
aa(lp447
VHe says this:
p448
aV"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
p449
aVEnwrought with gold and silver light,
p450
aVThe blue and the dim and the dark cloths
p451
aVOf night and light and the half-light,
p452
aVI would spread the cloths under your feet:
p453
aVBut I, being poor, have only my dreams;
p454
aVI have spread my dreams under your feet;
p455
aVTread softly
p456
aVbecause you tread on my dreams."
p457
aVAnd every day, everywhere,
p458
aVour children spread their dreams beneath our feet.
p459
aVAnd we should tread softly.
p460
aa(lp461
VThank you.
p462
aa(lp463
V(Applause)
p464
aa(lp465
VThank you very much.
