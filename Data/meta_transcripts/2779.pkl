VChris Anderson: So Robert spent the last few years
p4
aVthink about how weird human behavior is,
p5
aVand how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is.
p6
aVAnd it's very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it
p7
aVin public for the first time.
p8
aVOver to you now, Robert Sapolsky.

VRobert Sapolsky: Thank you.
p13
aVThe fantasy always runs something like this.
p14
aVI've overpowered his elite guard,
p15
aVburst into his secret bunker
p16
aVwith my machine gun ready.
p17
aVHe lunges for his Luger.
p18
aVI knock it out of his hand.
p19
aVHe lunges for his cyanide pill.
p20
aVI knock that out of his hand.
p21
aVHe snarls,
p22
aVcomes at me with otherworldly strength.
p23
aVWe grapple, we fight,
p24
aVI manage to pin him down
p25
aVand put on handcuffs.
p26
aV"Adolf Hitler," I say,
p27
aV"I arrest you for crimes against humanity."
p28
aa(lp29
VHere's where the Medal of Honor version of the fantasy ends
p30
aVand the imagery darkens.
p31
aVWhat would I do if I had Hitler?
p32
aVIt's not hard to imagine once I allow myself.
p33
aVSever his spine at the neck.
p34
aVTake out his eyes with a blunt instrument.
p35
aVPuncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.
p36
aVLeave him alive on a respirator,
p37
aVtube-fed, not able to speak or move or see or hear, just to feel,
p38
aVand then inject him with something cancerous
p39
aVthat's going to fester and pustulate
p40
aVuntil every cell in his body is screaming in agony,
p41
aVuntil every second feels like an eternity in hell.
p42
aVThat's what I would do to Hitler.
p43
aa(lp44
VI've had this fantasy since I was a kid,
p45
aVstill do sometimes,
p46
aVand when I do, my heart speeds up \u2014
p47
aVall these plans for the most evil, wicked soul in history.
p48
aVBut there's a problem,
p49
aVwhich is I don't actually believe in souls or evil,
p50
aVand I think wicked belongs in a musical.
p51
aVBut there's some people I would like to see killed,
p52
aVbut I'm against the death penalty.
p53
aVBut I like schlocky violent movies,
p54
aVbut I'm for strict gun control.
p55
aVBut then there was a time I was at a laser tag place,
p56
aVand I had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people.
p57
aVIn other words, I'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, as a species, we obviously have problems with violence.
p60
aVWe use shower heads to deliver poison gas,
p61
aVletters with anthrax, airplanes as weapons,
p62
aVmass rape as a military strategy.
p63
aVWe're a miserably violent species.
p64
aVBut there's a complication,
p65
aVwhich is we don't hate violence,
p66
aVwe hate the wrong kind.
p67
aVAnd when it's the right kind,
p68
aVwe cheer it on, we hand out medals,
p69
aVwe vote for, we mate with our champions of it.
p70
aVWhen it's the right kind of violence,
p71
aVwe love it.
p72
aVAnd there's another complication,
p73
aVwhich is, in addition to us being this miserably violent species,
p74
aVwe're also this extraordinarily altruistic, compassionate one.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors,
p77
aVour worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between?
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, for starters,
p80
aVwhat's totally boring is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior.
p81
aVYour brain tells your spine, tells your muscles
p82
aVto do something or other,
p83
aVand hooray, you've behaved.
p84
aVWhat's hard is understanding the meaning of the behavior,
p85
aVbecause in some settings, pulling a trigger is an appalling act;
p86
aVin others, it's heroically self-sacrificial.
p87
aVIn some settings, putting your hand one someone else's
p88
aVis deeply compassionate.
p89
aVIn others, it's a deep betrayal.
p90
aVThe challenge is to understand
p91
aVthe biology of the context of our behaviors,
p92
aVand that's real tough.
p93
aa(lp94
VOne thing that's clear, though, is you're not going to get anywhere
p95
aVif you think there's going to be the brain region or the hormone
p96
aVor the gene or the childhood experience
p97
aVor the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything.
p98
aVInstead, every bit of behavior has multiple levels of causality.
p99
aa(lp100
VLet's look at an example.
p101
aVYou have a gun.
p102
aVThere's a crisis going on:
p103
aVrioting, violence, people running around.
p104
aVA stranger is running at you in an agitated state \u2014
p105
aVyou can't quite tell if the expression is frightened, threatening, angry \u2014
p106
aVholding something that kind of looks like a handgun.
p107
aVYou're not sure.
p108
aVThe stranger comes running at you
p109
aVand you pull the trigger.
p110
aVAnd it turns out that thing in this person's hand
p111
aVwas a cell phone.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo we asked this biological question:
p114
aVwhat was going on that caused this behavior?
p115
aVWhat caused this behavior?
p116
aVAnd this is a multitude of questions.
p117
aa(lp118
VWe start.
p119
aVWhat was going on in your brain one second before you pulled that trigger?
p120
aVAnd this brings us into the realm of a brain region called the amygdala.
p121
aVThe amygdala, which is central to violence, central to fear,
p122
aVinitiates volleys of cascades
p123
aVthat produce pulling of a trigger.
p124
aVWhat was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before?
p125
aa(lp126
VBut to understand that, we have to step back a little bit.
p127
aVWhat was going on in the environment seconds to minutes before
p128
aVthat impacted the amygdala?
p129
aVNow, obviously, the sights, the sounds of the rioting,
p130
aVthat was pertinent.
p131
aVBut in addition,
p132
aVyou're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun
p133
aVif that stranger was male
p134
aVand large and of a different race.
p135
aVFurthermore, if you're in pain,
p136
aVif you're hungry, if you're exhausted,
p137
aVyour frontal cortex is not going to work as well,
p138
aVpart of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time
p139
aVsaying, "Are you really sure that's a gun there?"
p140
aa(lp141
VBut we need to step further back.
p142
aVNow we have to look at hours to days before,
p143
aVand with this, we have entered the realm of hormones.
p144
aVFor example, testosterone,
p145
aVwhere regardless of your sex,
p146
aVif you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood,
p147
aVyou're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression
p148
aVis instead looking threatening.
p149
aVElevated testosterone levels, elevated levels of stress hormones,
p150
aVand your amygdala is going to be more active
p151
aVand your frontal cortex will be more sluggish.
p152
aa(lp153
VPushing back further, weeks to months before,
p154
aVwhere's the relevance there?
p155
aVThis is the realm of neural plasticity,
p156
aVthe fact that your brain can change in response to experience,
p157
aVand if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma,
p158
aVyour amygdala will have enlarged.
p159
aVThe neurons will have become more excitable,
p160
aVyour frontal cortex would have atrophied,
p161
aVall relevant to what happens in that one second.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut we push back even more, back years,
p164
aVback, for example, to your adolescence.
p165
aVNow, the central fact of the adolescent brain
p166
aVis all of it is going full blast
p167
aVexcept the frontal cortex,
p168
aVwhich is still half-baked.
p169
aVIt doesn't fully mature until you're around 25.
p170
aVAnd thus, adolescence and early adulthood
p171
aVare the years where environment and experience sculpt your frontal cortex
p172
aVinto the version you're going to have as an adult in that critical moment.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut pushing back even further,
p175
aVeven further back to childhood and fetal life
p176
aVand all the different versions that that could come in.
p177
aVNow, obviously, that's the time that your brain is being constructed,
p178
aVand that's important,
p179
aVbut in addition, experience during those times
p180
aVproduce what are called epigenetic changes,
p181
aVpermanent, in some cases,
p182
aVpermanently activating certain genes, turning off others.
p183
aVAnd as an example of this,
p184
aVif as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through your mother,
p185
aVepigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood
p186
aVas a more excitable form,
p187
aVand you're going to have elevated stress hormone levels.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut pushing even further back,
p190
aVback to when you were just a fetus,
p191
aVback to when all you were was a collection of genes.
p192
aVNow, genes are really important to all of this,
p193
aVbut critically, genes don't determine anything,
p194
aVbecause genes work differently in different environments.
p195
aVKey example here:
p196
aVthere's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,
p197
aVand if you have that variant,
p198
aVyou are far more likely to commit antisocial violence
p199
aVif, and only if, you were abused as a child.
p200
aVGenes and environment interact,
p201
aVand what's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger
p202
aVreflects your lifetime of those gene-environment interactions.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, remarkably enough, we've got to push even further back now,
p205
aVback centuries.
p206
aVWhat were your ancestors up to.
p207
aVAnd if, for example, they were nomadic pastoralists,
p208
aVthey were pastoralists,
p209
aVpeople living in deserts or grasslands
p210
aVwith their herds of camels, cows, goats,
p211
aVodds are they would have invented what's called a culture of honor
p212
aVfilled with warrior classes,
p213
aVretributive violence, clan vendettas,
p214
aVand amazingly, centuries later,
p215
aVthat would still be influencing the values with which you were raised.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut we've got to push even further back,
p218
aVback millions of years,
p219
aVbecause if we're talking about genes,
p220
aVimplicitly we're now talking about the evolution of genes.
p221
aVAnd what you see is, for example,
p222
aVpatterns across different primate species.
p223
aVSome of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression,
p224
aVothers have evolved in the opposite direction,
p225
aVand floating there in between by every measure are humans,
p226
aVonce again this confused, barely defined species
p227
aVthat has all these potentials to go one way or the other.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo what has this gotten us to?
p230
aVBasically, what we're seeing here is,
p231
aVif you want to understand a behavior,
p232
aVwhether it's an appalling one, a wondrous one,
p233
aVor confusedly in between,
p234
aVif you want to understand that,
p235
aVyou've got take into account what happened a second before
p236
aVto a million years before,
p237
aVeverything in between.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo what can we conclude at this point?
p240
aVOfficially, it's complicated.
p241
aVWow, that's really helpful.
p242
aVIt's complicated,
p243
aVand you'd better be real careful, real cautious
p244
aVbefore you conclude you know what causes a behavior,
p245
aVespecially if it's a behavior you're judging harshly.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow, to me, the single most important point about all of this
p248
aVis one having to do with change.
p249
aVEvery bit of biology I have mentioned here can change in different circumstances.
p250
aVFor example, ecosystems change.
p251
aVThousands of years ago, the Sahara was a lush grassland.
p252
aVCultures change.
p253
aVIn the 17th century, the most terrifying people in Europe were the Swedes,
p254
aVrampaging all over the place.
p255
aVThis is what the Swedish military does now.
p256
aVThey haven't had a war in 200 years.
p257
aVMost importantly,
p258
aVbrains change.
p259
aVNeurons grow new processes.
p260
aVCircuits disconnect.
p261
aVEverything in the brain changes,
p262
aVand out of this come extraordinary examples of human change.
p263
aa(lp264
VFirst one:
p265
aVthis is a man named John Newton,
p266
aVa British theologian
p267
aVwho played a central role in the abolition of slavery from the British Empire
p268
aVin the early 1800s.
p269
aVAnd amazingly, this man spent decades as a younger man
p270
aVas the captain of a slave ship,
p271
aVand then as an investor in slavery,
p272
aVgrowing rich from this.
p273
aVAnd then something changed.
p274
aVSomething changed in him,
p275
aVsomething that Newton himself celebrated in the thing that he's most famous for,
p276
aVa hymn that he wrote:
p277
aV"Amazing Grace."
p278
aa(lp279
VThis is a man named Zenji Abe on the morning of December 6, 1941,
p280
aVabout to lead a squadron of Japanese bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.
p281
aVAnd this is the same man 50 years later to the day
p282
aVhugging a man who survived the attack on the ground.
p283
aVAnd as an old man,
p284
aVZenji Abe came to a collection of Pearl Harbor survivors
p285
aVat a ceremony there
p286
aVand in halting English apologized for what he had done as a young man.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, it doesn't always require decades.
p289
aVSometimes, extraordinary change could happen in just hours.
p290
aVConsider the World War I Christmas truce of 1914.
p291
aVThe powers that be had negotiated a brief truce
p292
aVso that soldiers could go out,
p293
aVcollect bodies from no-man's-land in between the trench lines.
p294
aVAnd soon British and German soldiers
p295
aVwere doing that,
p296
aVand then helping each other carry bodies,
p297
aVand then helping each other dig graves in the frozen ground,
p298
aVand then praying together,
p299
aVand then having Christmas together and exchanging gifts,
p300
aVand by the next day, they were playing soccer together
p301
aVand exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war.
p302
aVThat truce kept going until the officers had to arrive
p303
aVand said, "We will shoot you
p304
aVunless you go back to trying to kill each other."
p305
aVAnd all it took here was hours
p306
aVfor these men to develop a completely new category of "us,"
p307
aVall of us in the trenches here
p308
aVon both sides, dying for no damn reason,
p309
aVand who is a "them," those faceless powers behind the lines
p310
aVwho were using them as pawns.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd sometimes, change can occur in seconds.
p313
aVProbably the most horrifying event in the Vietnam War
p314
aVwas the My Lai Massacre.
p315
aVA brigade of American soldiers
p316
aVwent into an undefended village full of civilians
p317
aVand killed between 350 and 500 of them,
p318
aVmass-raped women and children,
p319
aVmutilated bodies.
p320
aVIt was appalling.
p321
aVIt was appalling because it occurred, because the government denied it,
p322
aVbecause the US government eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,
p323
aVand appalling because it almost certainly was not a singular event.
p324
aVThis man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man who stopped the My Lai Massacre.
p325
aVHe was piloting a helicopter gunship,
p326
aVlanded there, got out
p327
aVand saw American soldiers shooting babies,
p328
aVshooting old women,
p329
aVfigured out what was going on,
p330
aVand he then took his helicopter
p331
aVand did something that undid his lifetime of conditioning
p332
aVas to who is an "us" and who is a "them."
p333
aVHe landed his helicopter
p334
aVin between some surviving villagers and American soldiers
p335
aVand he trained his machine guns on his fellow Americans,
p336
aVand said, "If you don't stop the killing, I will mow you down."
p337
aa(lp338
VNow, these people are no more special than any of us.
p339
aVSame neurons, same neurochemicals,
p340
aVsame biology.
p341
aVWhat we're left with here is this inevitable cliche:
p342
aV"Those who don't study history are destined to repeat it."
p343
aVWhat we have here is the opposite of it.
p344
aVThose who don't study the history of extraordinary human change,
p345
aVthose who don't study the biology of what can transform us
p346
aVfrom our worst to our best behaviors,
p347
aVthose who don't do this are destined not to be able
p348
aVto repeat these incandescent, magnificent moments.
p349
