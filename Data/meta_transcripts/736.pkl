VIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
p4
aVMillions of people were in severe need of help.
p5
aVThe U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
p6
aVBut there were no maps, no maps of roads,
p7
aVno maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,
p10
aVit is hard to believe
p11
aVthat as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world
p12
aVwas mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
p13
aVThe U.N. ran headfirst into a problem
p14
aVthat the majority of the world's populous faces:
p15
aVnot having detailed maps.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut help was coming.
p18
aVAt Google, 40 volunteers
p19
aVused a new software
p20
aVto map 120,000 kilometers of roads,
p21
aV3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
p22
aVAnd it took them four days.
p23
aVThe new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
p24
aa(lp25
VGoogle Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us
p26
aVto map what we know locally.
p27
aVPeople have used this software
p28
aVto map everything from roads to rivers,
p29
aVfrom schools to local businesses,
p30
aVand video stores to the corner store.
p31
aa(lp32
VMaps matter.
p33
aVNobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

aVof real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn the last year alone,
p41
aVthousands of users in 170 countries
p42
aVhave mapped millions of pieces of information,
p43
aVand created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
p44
aVAnd this was made possible by
p45
aVthe power of passionate users everywhere.
p46
aa(lp47
VLet's look at some of the maps
p48
aVbeing created by users right now.
p49
aVSo, as we speak, people are mapping the world
p50
aVin these 170 countries.
p51
aVYou can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
p52
aVAnd, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
p53
aa(lp54
VThis is the result of computational geometry,
p55
aVgesture recognition, and machine learning.
p56
aVThis is a victory of thousands of users,
p57
aVin hundreds of cities,
p58
aVone user, one edit at a time.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is an invitation to the 70 percent
p61
aVof our unmapped planet.
p62
aVWelcome to the new world.
