VIt is said that the grass is always greener
p4
aVon the other side of the fence,
p5
aVand I believe this is true,
p6
aVespecially when I hear President Obama
p7
aVoften talk about the Korean education system
p8
aVas a benchmark of success.
p9
aVWell, I can tell you that,
p10
aVin the rigid structure and highly competitive nature
p11
aVof the Korean school system,
p12
aValso known as pressure cooker,
p13
aVnot everyone can do well in that environment.
p14
aVWhile many people responded in different ways
p15
aVabout our education system,
p16
aVmy response to the high-pressure environment
p17
aVwas making bows with pieces of wood
p18
aVfound near my apartment building.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhy bows?
p21
aVI'm not quite sure.
p22
aVPerhaps, in the face of constant pressure,
p23
aVmy caveman instinct of survival
p24
aVhas connected with the bows.
p25
aVIf you think about it,
p26
aVthe bow has really helped drive human survival
p27
aVsince prehistoric times.
p28
aVThe area within three kilometers of my home
p29
aVused to be a mulberry forest
p30
aVduring the Joseon dynasty,
p31
aVwhere silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.
p32
aVIn order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,
p33
aVthe government has planted mulberry trees.
p34
aVThe seeds from these trees
p35
aValso have spread by birds here and there
p36
aVnearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway
p37
aVthat has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
p38
aVThe area near these walls,
p39
aVwhich nobody bothers to pay attention to,
p40
aVhad been left free from major intervention,
p41
aVand this is where I first found my treasures.
p42
aa(lp43
VAs I fell deeper into bow making,
p44
aVI began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.
p45
aVWhen I went on school field trips,
p46
aVfamily vacations, or simply on my way home
p47
aVfrom extracurricular classes,
p48
aVI wandered around wooded areas
p49
aVand gathered tree branches
p50
aVwith the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.
p51
aVAnd they would be somethings like saws, knives,
p52
aVsickles and axes
p53
aVthat I covered up with a piece of towel.
p54
aVI would bring the branches home,
p55
aVriding buses and subways,
p56
aVbarely holding them in my hands.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
p59
aVAirport security.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aVIn the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,
p63
aVI would saw, trim and polish wood all night long
p64
aVuntil a bow took shape.
p65
aa(lp66
VOne day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece
p67
aVand ended up setting the place on fire.
p68
aVWhere? The rooftop of my apartment building,
p69
aVa place where 96 families call home.
p70
aVA customer from a department store across from my building
p71
aVcalled 911,
p72
aVand I ran downstairs to tell my mom
p73
aVwith half of my hair burned.
p74
aVI want to take this opportunity
p75
aVto tell my mom, in the audience today:
p76
aVMom, I was really sorry,
p77
aVand I will be more careful with open fire from now on.
p78
aa(lp79
VMy mother had to do a lot of explaining,
p80
aVtelling people that her son did not commit
p81
aVa premeditated arson.
p82
aa(lp83
VI also researched extensively on bows around the world.
p84
aVIn that process, I tried to combine
p85
aVthe different bows from across time and places
p86
aVto create the most effective bow.
p87
aVI also worked with many different types of wood,
p88
aVsuch as maple, yew and mulberry,
p89
aVand did many shooting experiments
p90
aVin the wooded area near the urban expressway
p91
aVthat I mentioned before.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe most effective bow for me
p94
aVwould be like this.
p95
aa(lp96
VOne: Curved tips can maximize the springiness
p97
aVwhen you draw and shoot the arrow.
p98
aa(lp99
VTwo: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,
p100
aVwhich means more power.
p101
aa(lp102
VThree: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb
p103
aVfor maximum tension storage.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
p106
aa(lp107
VAfter fixing, breaking, redesigning,
p108
aVmending, bending and amending,
p109
aVmy ideal bow began to take shape,
p110
aVand when it was finally done,
p111
aVit looked like this.
p112
aVI was so proud of myself
p113
aVfor inventing a perfect bow on my own.
p114
aVThis is a picture of Korean traditional bows
p115
aVtaken from a museum,
p116
aVand see how my bow resembles them.
p117
aVThanks to my ancestors
p118
aVfor robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VThrough bowmaking,
p121
aVI came in contact with part of my heritage.
p122
aVLearning the information that has accumulated over time
p123
aVand reading the message left by my ancestors
p124
aVwere better than any consolation therapy
p125
aVor piece of advice any living adults could give me.
p126
aVYou see, I searched far and wide,
p127
aVbut never bothered to look close and near.
p128
aVFrom this realization,
p129
aVI began to take interest in Korean history,
p130
aVwhich had never inspired me before.
p131
aVIn the end, the grass is often greener
p132
aVon my side of the fence,
p133
aValthough we don't realize it.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, I am going to show you how my bow works.
p136
aVAnd let's see how this one works.
p137
aVThis is a bamboo bow,
p138
aVwith 45-pound draw weights.
p139
aV(Noise of shooting arrow)
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VA bow may function in a simple mechanism,
p143
aVbut in order to make a good bow,
p144
aVa great amount of sensitivity is required.
p145
aVYou need to console and communicate
p146
aVwith the wood material.
p147
aVEach fiber in the wood
p148
aVhas its own reason and function for being,
p149
aVand only through cooperation and harmony among them
p150
aVcomes a great bow.
p151
aVI may be an [odd] student
p152
aVwith unconventional interests,
p153
aVbut I hope I am making a contribution
p154
aVby sharing my story with all of you.
p155
aa(lp156
VMy ideal world is a place
p157
aVwhere no one is left behind,
p158
aVwhere everyone is needed exactly where they are,
p159
aVlike the fibers and the tendons in a bow,
p160
aVa place where the strong is flexible
p161
aVand the vulnerable is resilient.
p162
aVThe bow resembles me,
p163
aVand I resemble the bow.
p164
aVNow, I am shooting a part of myself to you.
p165
aVNo, better yet, a part of my mind
p166
aVhas just been shot over to your mind.
p167
aVDid it strike you?
p168
aa(lp169
VThank you.
