VThis is a map of New York State
p4
aVthat was made in 1937 by the General Drafting Company.
p5
aVIt's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds,
p6
aVbecause down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains,
p7
aVthere is a little town called Roscoe \u2014
p8
aVactually, this will go easier if I just put it up here \u2014
p9
aVThere's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,
p10
aVand then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
p11
aa(lp12
VAgloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers,
p13
aVbecause it's a paper town.
p14
aVIt's also known as a copyright trap.
p15
aVMapmakers \u2014 because my map of New York and your map of New York
p16
aVare going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York \u2014
p17
aVoften, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps,
p18
aVin order to protect their copyright.
p19
aVBecause then, if my fake place shows up on your map,
p20
aVI can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me.
p21
aVAgloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map,
p22
aVErnest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,
p23
aVand they released this map in 1937.
p24
aVDecades later, Rand McNally releases a map
p25
aVwith Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection
p26
aVof two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere.
p27
aVWell, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting.
p28
aVThey immediately call Rand McNally, and they say,
p29
aV"We've caught you! We made Agloe, New York, up.
p30
aVIt is a fake place. It's a paper town.
p31
aVWe're going to sue your pants off!"
p32
aVAnd Rand McNally says, "No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."
p33
aVBecause people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
Vin the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe \u2014
p38
aVsomeone built a place called Agloe, New York.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VIt had a gas station, a general store, two houses at its peak.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist,
p47
aVbecause we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper
p48
aVcan change the actual world in which we're actually living,
p49
aVwhich is why my third book is called "Paper Towns".
p50
aa(lp51
VBut what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened,
p52
aVis the phenomenon itself.
p53
aVIt's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right?
p54
aVLike the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps.
p55
aVBut what I find a lot more interesting is the way
p56
aVthat the manner in which we map the world changes the world.
p57
aVBecause the world would truly be a different place if North were down.
p58
aVAnd the world would be a truly different place
p59
aVif Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map.
p60
aVAnd the world would be a different place
p61
aVif we projected Europe to show it in its actual size.
p62
aVThe world is changed by our maps of the world.
p63
aVThe way that we choose \u2014 sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise,
p64
aValso shapes the map of our lives,
p65
aVand that in turn shapes our lives.
p66
aa(lp67
VI believe that what we map changes the life we lead.
p68
aVAnd I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,
p69
aVyou-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense.
p70
aVBut I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,
p71
aVthey show you where you might go.
p72
aVYou very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I was a really terrible student when I was a kid.
p75
aVMy GPA was consistently in the low 2s.
p76
aVAnd I think the reason that I was such a terrible student
p77
aVis that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles
p78
aVthat had been erected before me,
p79
aVand I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood.
p80
aVAnd I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles,
p81
aVbecause they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,
p82
aVand then people would threaten me, you know,
p83
aVthey'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record,"
p84
aVor "You'll never get a good job."
p85
aVI didn't want a good job!
p86
aVAs far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old,
p87
aVlike, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
Vand the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did
p92
aVwas tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks.
p93
aVThey literally put nooses on themselves,
p94
aVand then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were.
p95
aVThat's not a recipe for a happy life.
p96
aVThese people \u2014 in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination \u2014
p97
aVthese people who are strangling themselves
p98
aVas one of the first things they do each morning,
p99
aVthey can't possibly be happy.
p100
aVWhy would I want to jump over all of these hurdles
p101
aVand have that be the end?
p102
aVThat's a terrible end!
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school,
p105
aVIndian Springs School, a small boarding school,
p106
aVoutside of Birmingham, Alabama.
p107
aVAnd all at once I became a learner.
p108
aVAnd I became a learner, because I found myself
p109
aVin a community of learners.
p110
aVI found myself surrounded by people
p111
aVwho celebrated intellectualism and engagement,
p112
aVand who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement
p113
aVwasn't clever, or funny,
p114
aVbut, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response
p115
aVto very complicated and compelling problems.
p116
aVAnd so I started to learn, because learning was cool.
p117
aVI learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets,
p118
aVand I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears.
p119
aVI learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict,
p120
aVI learned some physics,
p121
aVI learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation \u2014
p122
aVall of these things, by the way,
p123
aVenriched my life on a literally daily basis.
p124
aVAnd it's true that I don't use most of them for my "job,"
p125
aVbut that's not what it's about for me.
p126
aVIt's about cartography.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat is the process of cartography?
p129
aVIt's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking,
p130
aV"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"
p131
aVand then wondering, "Maybe there's some more land to draw."
p132
aVAnd that's when learning really began for me.
p133
aVIt's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me,
p134
aVand I was very fortunate to have those teachers,
p135
aVbecause I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me.
p136
aVBut a lot of the learning that I did in high school
p137
aVwasn't about what happened inside the classroom,
p138
aVit was about what happened outside of the classroom.
p139
aVFor instance, I can tell you
p140
aVthat "There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons \u2014
p141
aVThat oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes \u2014"
p142
aVnot because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school
p143
aVwhen I was in high school,
p144
aVbut because there was a girl when I was in high school,
p145
aVand her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her,
p146
aVand she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.
p147
aVThe reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is,
p148
aVis because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch,
p149
aVmy friend Emmet walked in, and he said,
p150
aV"How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?"
p151
aVAnd I said, "I don't know, like, six hours?" and he said,
p152
aV"Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,
p153
aVyou could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways,
p154
aVyou just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart."
p155
aVAnd I was, like, "I'll take that deal."
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VBut I learned what opportunity cost is.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd along the way, the map of my life got better.
p162
aVIt got bigger; it contained more places.
p163
aVThere were more things that might happen,
p164
aVmore futures I might have.
p165
aVIt wasn't a formal, organized learning process,
p166
aVand I'm happy to admit that.
p167
aVIt was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know.
p168
aVI might know, you know, Cantor's idea
p169
aVthat some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets,
p170
aVbut I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea.
p171
aVI might know the idea of opportunity cost,
p172
aVbut I didn't know the law of diminishing returns.
p173
aVBut the great thing about imagining learning as cartography,
p174
aVinstead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles
p175
aVthat you have to jump over,
p176
aVis that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more.
p177
aVAnd so now I do know at least some of the calculus
p178
aVthat underlies all of that stuff.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, I had one learning community
p181
aVin high school, then I went to another for college,
p182
aVand then I went to another,
p183
aVwhen I started working at a magazine called "Booklist,"
p184
aVwhere I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people.
p185
aVAnd then I wrote a book.
p186
aVAnd like all authors dream of doing,
p187
aVI promptly quit my job.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd for the first time since high school,
p192
aVI found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable.
p193
aVI hated it.
p194
aVI read many, many books during this two-year period.
p195
aVI read books about Stalin,
p196
aVand books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims,
p197
aVand I read books about how to make atomic bombs,
p198
aVbut it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles,
p199
aVand then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement
p200
aVof being part of a community of learners, a community of people
p201
aVwho are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise
p202
aVof trying to better understand and map the world around us.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd then, in 2006, I met that guy.
p205
aVHis name is Ze Frank.
p206
aVI didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet.
p207
aVZe Frank was running, at the time, a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"
p208
aVand I discovered the show,
p209
aVand that was my way back into being a community learner again.
p210
aVHere's Ze talking about Las Vegas:
p211
aa(lp212
V(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert.
p213
aVAlmost everything here was brought from somewhere else \u2014
p214
aVthe sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls.
p215
aVThese fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew.
p216
aVContrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place,
p217
aVso are these people.
p218
aVThings from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories,
p219
aVand away from the people that experience them differently.
p220
aVSometimes improvements were made \u2014 even the Sphinx got a nose job.
p221
aVHere, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything.
p222
aVThis New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else.
p223
aVEverything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything:
p224
aVSelf Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.
p225
aVThis fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements,
p226
aVbecause no one belongs here; everyone does.
p227
aVAs I walked around this morning, I noticed most of the buildings
p228
aVwere huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert.
p229
aVBut unlike most mirrors,
p230
aVwhich present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place,
p231
aVthese mirrors come back empty.
p232
aa(lp233
VJohn Green: Makes me nostalgic for the days
p234
aVwhen you could see the pixels in online video.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VZe isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder,
p239
aVand the community of people that built up around these videos
p240
aVwas in many ways a community of learners.
p241
aVSo we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him.
p242
aVWe organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States.
p243
aVWe turned the Earth into a sandwich,
p244
aVby having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth,
p245
aVand on the exact opposite point of the Earth,
p246
aVhave another person holding a piece of bread.
p247
aVI realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also "learny" ideas,
p248
aVand that was what was so exciting to me,
p249
aVand if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place.
p250
aVFollow the calculus tag on Tumblr,
p251
aVand yes, you will see people complaining about calculus,
p252
aVbut you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints,
p253
aVmaking the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful,
p254
aVand here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable.
p255
aVYou can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits,
p256
aVlike "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"
p257
aVwhere you can ask people who are in these fields
p258
aVa wide range of questions,
p259
aVfrom very serious ones to very silly ones.
p260
aVBut to me, the most interesting communities of learners
p261
aVthat are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube,
p262
aVand admittedly, I am biased.
p263
aVBut I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
p264
aVLook for instance at "Minute Physics,"
p265
aVa guy who's teaching the world about physics:
p266
aa(lp267
V(Video) Let's cut to the chase.
p268
aVAs of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece
p269
aVof the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.
p270
aVBut, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson
p271
aVincluded in the standard model,
p272
aValongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks,
p273
aVif it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s?
p274
aVGood question. There are two main reasons.
p275
aVFirst, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field,
p276
aVthe Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation
p277
aVof the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
p278
aVThe Higgs field in turn plays an integral role
p279
aVin our model for the weak nuclear force.
p280
aVIn particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak.
p281
aVWe'll talk more about this in a later video,
p282
aVbut even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,
p283
aVthe Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now
p284
aVwe've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence.
p285
aa(lp286
VJG: Or here's a video that I made
p287
aVas part of my show "Crash Course," talking about World War I:
p288
aa(lp289
V(Video) The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo
p290
aVof the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
p291
aVon June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.
p292
aVQuick aside: It's worth noting
p293
aVthat the first big war of the twentieth century began
p294
aVwith an act of terrorism.
p295
aVSo Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked
p296
aVby his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \u2014 now that is a mustache!
p297
aVBut even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,
p298
aVwhereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands,
p299
aVleading Austria to declare war against Serbia.
p300
aVAnd then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army.
p301
aVGermany, because it had an alliance with Austria,
p302
aVtold Russia to stop mobilizing,
p303
aVwhich Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army,
p304
aVdeclared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,
p305
aVand then declared war on France, because, you know, France.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd it's not just physics and world history
p310
aVthat people are choosing to learn through YouTube.
p311
aVHere's a video about abstract mathematics.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again,
p314
aVbecause they make you go every single day.
p315
aVAnd you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series.
p316
aVThat's a high school topic, right?
p317
aVWhich is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.
p318
aVSo I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum.
p319
aVSo, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling
p320
aVand thinking more about what the plural of "series" should be
p321
aVthan about the topic at hand: "serieses," "seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"
p322
aVOr is it that the singular should be changed: one "serie," or "serum,"
p323
aVjust like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop."
p324
aVBut the whole concept of things
p325
aVlike 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say,
p326
aVyou want to draw a line of elephants,
p327
aVeach holding the tail of the next one:
p328
aVnormal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,
p329
aVpuppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.
p330
aVWhich is at least a tiny bit awesome,
p331
aVbecause you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line,
p332
aVand still have it fit across a single notebook page.
p333
aa(lp334
VJG: And lastly, here's Destin, from "Smarter Every Day,"
p335
aVtalking about the conservation of angular momentum,
p336
aVand, since it's YouTube, cats:
p337
aa(lp338
V(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."
p339
aVSo you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet.
p340
aVToday's question is: why?
p341
aVLike most simple questions, there's a very complex answer.
p342
aVFor instance, let me reword this question:
p343
aVHow does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame,
p344
aVwithout violating the conservation of angular momentum?
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VJG: So, here's something all four of these videos have in common:
p349
aVThey all have more than half a million views on YouTube.
p350
aVAnd those are people watching not in classrooms,
p351
aVbut because they are part of the communities of learning
p352
aVthat are being set up by these channels.
p353
aVAnd I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me,
p354
aVand in many ways it is, because here is the instructor \u2014
p355
aVit's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor,
p356
aVand then beneath the instructor are the students,
p357
aVand they're all having a conversation.
p358
aVAnd I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation
p359
aVin the world of the Internet,
p360
aVbut in fact, if you go on comments for these channels,
p361
aVwhat you'll find is people engaging the subject matter,
p362
aVasking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter,
p363
aVand then other people answering those questions.
p364
aVAnd because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you
p365
aVis on the exact \u2014 the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page
p366
aVas your comments,
p367
aVyou are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation.
p368
aVAnd because I'm in comments usually, I get to participate with you.
p369
aVAnd you find this whether it's world history,
p370
aVor mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.
p371
aa(lp372
VYou also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet
p373
aVin order to create places for intellectual engagement,
p374
aVinstead of the ironic detachment
p375
aVthat maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions \u2014
p376
aVyou know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."
p377
aVOr, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism:
p378
aa(lp379
V["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity.
p380
aVQuite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism."]
p381
aa(lp382
VIn case you can't see what she says ... yeah.
p383
aa(lp384
VI really believe that these spaces,
p385
aVthese communities, have become for a new generation of learners,
p386
aVthe kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities
p387
aVthat I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college.
p388
aVAnd as an adult, re-finding these communities
p389
aVhas re-introduced me to a community of learners,
p390
aVand has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood,
p391
aVso that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young.
p392
aVVi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me
p393
aVto all kinds of things that I didn't know before.
p394
aVAnd I know that we all hearken back
p395
aVto the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment,
p396
aVor to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,
p397
aV"Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that,
p398
aVI wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes."
p399
aVBut I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist.
p400
aVThey exist in corners of the Internet, where old men fear to tread.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,
p405
aVwhen we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.
p406
aa(lp407
VThank you.
