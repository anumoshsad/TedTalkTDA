VI'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word,
p4
aVone that people will do almost anything
p5
aVto avoid becoming.
p6
aVBillion-dollar industries thrive
p7
aVbecause of the fear of it,
p8
aVand those of us who undeniably are it
p9
aVare left to navigate a relentless storm
p10
aVsurrounding it.
p11
aa(lp12
VI'm not sure if any of you have noticed,
p13
aVbut I'm fat.
p14
aVNot the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind,
p15
aVor the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly.
p16
aVI'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind.
p17
aa(lp18
VLet's not sugarcoat it.
p19
aVI am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.
p20
aVI am the elephant in the room.
p21
aVWhen I walked out on stage,
p22
aVsome of you may have been thinking,
p23
aV"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,
p24
aVbecause everybody knows that fat people are funny."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VOr you may have been thinking, "Where does she get her confidence from?"
p29
aVBecause a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable.
p30
aVThe fashion-conscious members of the audience
p31
aVmay have been thinking how fabulous I look
p32
aVin this Beth Ditto dress \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Cheers)
p35
aa(lp36
Vthank you very much.
p37
aVWhereas some of you might have thought,
p38
aV"Hmm, black would have been so much more slimming."
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VYou may have wondered, consciously or not,
p43
aVif I have diabetes, or a partner,
p44
aVor if I eat carbs after 7pm.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VYou may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night,
p49
aVand that you really should renew your gym membership.
p50
aa(lp51
VThese judgments are insidious.
p52
aVThey can be directed at individuals and groups,
p53
aVand they can also be directed at ourselves.
p54
aVAnd this way of thinking is known as fatphobia.
p55
aa(lp56
VLike any form of systematic oppression,
p57
aVfatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures
p58
aVlike capitalism, patriarchy and racism,
p59
aVand that can make it really difficult to see,
p60
aVlet alone challenge.
p61
aVWe live in a culture
p62
aVwhere being fat is seen as being a bad person \u2014
p63
aVlazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible
p64
aVand morally suspect.
p65
aVAnd we tend to see thinness
p66
aVas being universally good \u2014
p67
aVresponsible, successful,
p68
aVand in control of our appetites, bodies and lives.
p69
aVWe see these ideas again and again
p70
aVin the media, in public health policy,
p71
aVdoctors' offices,
p72
aVin everyday conversations
p73
aVand in our own attitudes.
p74
aVWe may even blame fat people themselves
p75
aVfor the discrimination they face
p76
aVbecause, after all, if we don't like it, we should just lose weight.
p77
aVEasy.
p78
aVThis antifat bias has become so integral, so ingrained
p79
aVto how we value ourselves and each other
p80
aVthat we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size
p81
aVand where that disdain comes from.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut we must question it,
p84
aVbecause the enormous value we place on how we look
p85
aVaffects every one of us.
p86
aVAnd do we really want to live in a society
p87
aVwhere people are denied their basic humanity
p88
aVif they don't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable?
p89
aa(lp90
VSo when I was six years old,
p91
aVmy sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage.
p92
aVI was about a foot taller and a foot wider than most of the group.
p93
aVWhen it came to doing our first performance,
p94
aVI was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu.
p95
aVI was going to sparkle.
p96
aVAs the other girls slipped easily into their Lycra and tulle creations,
p97
aVnot one of the tutus was big enough to fit me.
p98
aVI was determined not to be excluded from the performance,
p99
aVso I turned to my mother
p100
aVand loud enough for everyone to hear
p101
aVsaid, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.
p102
aVI need a fourfour."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VThanks, Mom.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Applause)
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd although I didn't recognize it at the time,
p111
aVclaiming space for myself in that glorious fourfour
p112
aVwas the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, I'm not saying that this whole body-love thing
p115
aVhas been an easy skip along a glittering path of self-acceptance
p116
aVsince that day in class.
p117
aVFar from it.
p118
aVI soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal
p119
aVcan be a frustrating and isolating place.
p120
aVI've spent the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages,
p121
aVand it's been quite the roller coaster.
p122
aVI've been openly laughed at, abused from passing cars
p123
aVand been told that I'm delusional.
p124
aVI also receive smiles from strangers
p125
aVwho recognize what it takes to walk down the street
p126
aVwith a spring in your step and your head held high.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Cheer)
p129
aa(lp130
VThanks.
p131
aVAnd through it all, that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me,
p132
aVand she has helped me stand before you today
p133
aVas an unapologetic fat person,
p134
aVa person that simply refuses to subscribe
p135
aVto the dominant narrative
p136
aVabout how I should move through the world in this body of mine.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I'm not alone.
p141
aVI am part of an international community of people
p142
aVwho choose to, rather than passively accepting
p143
aVthat our bodies are and probably always will be big,
p144
aVwe actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today.
p145
aVPeople who honor our strength and work with, not against,
p146
aVour perceived limitations,
p147
aVpeople who value health
p148
aVas something much more holistic
p149
aVthan a number on an outdated BMI chart.
p150
aVInstead, we value mental health, self-worth and how we feel in our bodies
p151
aVas vital aspects to our overall well-being.
p152
aVPeople who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies
p153
aVis a barrier to anything, really.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere are doctors, academics and bloggers
p156
aVwho have written countless volumes
p157
aVon the many facets of this complex subject.
p158
aVThere are fatshionistas who reclaim their bodies and their beauty
p159
aVby wearing fatkinis and crop tops,
p160
aVexposing the flesh that we're all taught to hide.
p161
aVThere are fat athletes
p162
aVwho run marathons, teach yoga or do kickboxing,
p163
aVall done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo.
p164
aVAnd these people have taught me that radical body politics
p165
aVis the antidote to our body-shaming culture.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut to be clear, I'm not saying that people shouldn't change their bodies
p168
aVif that's what they want to do.
p169
aVReclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love
p170
aVand can look like a million different things,
p171
aVfrom hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring
p172
aVto hormones to surgery and yes, even weight loss.
p173
aVIt's simple: it's your body,
p174
aVand you decide what's best to do with it.
p175
aa(lp176
VMy way of engaging in activism
p177
aVis by doing all the things that we fatties aren't supposed to do,
p178
aVand there's a lot of them,
p179
aVinviting other people to join me and then making art about it.
p180
aVThe common thread through most of this work
p181
aVhas been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies,
p182
aVfrom the catwalk to club shows,
p183
aVfrom public swimming pools to prominent dance stages.
p184
aVAnd reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement
p185
aVbut a radical community-building approach.
p186
aVThis was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" \u2014
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
Vthe fat fem synchronized swim team
p191
aVI started with a group of friends in Sydney.
p192
aVThe impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women
p193
aVin flowery swimming caps and bathers
p194
aVthrowing their legs in the air without a care
p195
aVshould not be underestimated.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VThroughout my career, I have learned that fat bodies are inherently political,
p200
aVand unapologetic fat bodies
p201
aVcan blow people's minds.
p202
aVWhen director Kate Champion,
p203
aVof acclaimed dance theater company Force Majeure,
p204
aVasked me to be the artistic associate
p205
aVon a work featuring all fat dancers,
p206
aVI literally jumped at the opportunity.
p207
aVAnd I mean literally.
p208
aV"Nothing to Lose" is a work made in collaboration with performers of size
p209
aVwho drew from their lived experiences
p210
aVto create a work as varied and authentic as we all are.
p211
aVAnd it was as far from ballet as you could imagine.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company
p214
aVwas, to put it mildly, controversial,
p215
aVbecause nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before
p216
aVanywhere in the world.
p217
aa(lp218
VPeople were skeptical.
p219
aV"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'
p220
aVLike, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?
p221
aVWhere did they do their dance training?
p222
aVAre they going to have the stamina for a full-length production?"
p223
aa(lp224
VBut despite the skepticism,
p225
aV"Nothing to Lose" became a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.
p226
aVWe received rave reviews, toured,
p227
aVwon awards and were written about in over 27 languages.
p228
aVThese incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide.
p229
aVI've lost count of how many times people of all sizes
p230
aVhave told me that the show has changed their lives,
p231
aVhow it helped them shift their relationship
p232
aVto their own and other people's bodies,
p233
aVand how it made them confront their own bias.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut of course, work that pushes people's buttons
p236
aVis not without its detractors.
p237
aVI have been told that I'm glorifying obesity.
p238
aVI have received violent death threats
p239
aVand abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people's bodies and lives
p240
aVand treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell.
p241
aVI've even been called
p242
aV"the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" \u2014
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
Va comment so absurd that it is funny.
p247
aVBut it also speaks to the panic,
p248
aVthe literal terror,
p249
aVthat the fear of fat can evoke.
p250
aVIt is this fear that's feeding the diet industry,
p251
aVwhich is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies,
p252
aVfor waiting to be the after-photo
p253
aVbefore we truly start to live our lives.
p254
aVBecause the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia.
p255
aVFat activism refuses to indulge this fear.
p256
aVBy advocating for self-determination and respect for all of us,
p257
aVwe can shift society's reluctance to embrace diversity
p258
aVand start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
