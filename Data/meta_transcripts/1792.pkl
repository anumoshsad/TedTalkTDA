VMy name is Tom,
p4
aVand I've come here today to come clean
p5
aVabout what I do for money.
p6
aVBasically, I use my mouth in strange ways
p7
aVin exchange for cash.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVI usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars
p10
aVand on street corners,
p11
aVso this mightn't be the most appropriate setting,
p12
aVbut I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration
p13
aVabout what I do.
p14
aV(Beatboxing)
p15
aVAnd now, for my next number,
p16
aVI'd like to return to the classics.
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aVWe're going to take it back,
p19
aVway back,
p20
aVback into time.
p21
aV(Beatboxing: "Billie Jean")
p22
aV\u266b Billie Jean is not my lover \u266b
p23
aV\u266b She's just a girl who claims that I am the one \u266b
p24
aV\u266b But the kid is not my son \u266b
p25
aV(Applause) All right.
p26
aVWassup.
p27
aVThank you very much, TEDx.
p28
aVIf you guys haven't figured it out already,
p29
aVmy name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,
p30
aVwhich means all the sounds that you just heard
p31
aVwere made entirely using just my voice,
p32
aVand the only thing was my voice.
p33
aVAnd I can assure you
p34
aVthere are absolutely no effects
p35
aVon this microphone whatsoever.
p36
aVAnd I'm very, very stoked \u2014
p37
aV(Applause)
p38
aVYou guys are just applauding for everything. It's great.
p39
aVLook at this, Mom! I made it!
p40
aVI'm very, very stoked to be here today,
p41
aVrepresenting my kinfolk
p42
aVand all those that haven't managed to make a career
p43
aVout of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking.
p44
aVBecause it is a bit of a niche market,
p45
aVand there's not much work going on,
p46
aVespecially where I'm from.
p47
aVYou know, I'm from Brisbane,
p48
aVwhich is a great city to live in.
p49
aVYeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here. That's good.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVYou know, I'm from Brizzy,
p52
aVwhich is a great city to live in,
p53
aVbut let's be honest \u2014
p54
aVit's not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere.
p55
aVSo I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane
p56
aVand outside Australia,
p57
aVand so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine
p58
aVhas enabled me to see
p59
aVso many amazing places in the world.
p60
aVSo I'd like to share with you, if I may, my experiences.
p61
aVSo ladies and gentlemen,
p62
aVI would like to take you on a journey
p63
aVthroughout the continents
p64
aVand throughout sound itself.
p65
aVWe start our journey in the central deserts.
p66
aV(Didgeridoo)

p74

p75
aV(Beatboxing)
p76
aVParty, party, yeah.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVAnd before we reach our final destination,
p79
aVladies and gentlemen,
p80
aVI would like to share with you some technology
p81
aVthat I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.
p82
aVThese things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads,
p83
aVand they allow me to do a whole lot of different things
p84
aVwith my voice.
p85
aVFor example, the one on the left here
p86
aVallows me to add
p87
aVa little bit of reverb to my sound,
p88
aVwhich gives me that \u2014
p89
aV(Trumpet) \u2014
p90
aVflavor.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVAnd the other ones here,
p93
aVI can use them in unison
p94
aVto mimic the effect of a drum machine
p95
aVor something like that.
p96
aVI can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back
p97
aVjust by hitting the pads here.
p98
aV(Noises)
p99
aVTEDx.
p100
aV(Music)
p101
aV(Applause)
p102
aVI got way too much time on my hands.
p103
aVAnd last but not least,
p104
aVthe one on my right here allows me to
p105
aVloop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop
p106
aVmy voice.
p107
aVSo with all that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,
p108
aVI would like to take you on a journey
p109
aVto a completely separate part of Earth
p110
aVas I transform the Sydney Opera House
p111
aVinto a smoky downtown jazz bar.
p112
aVAll right boys, take it away.
p113
aV(Music)
p114
aVLadies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you
p115
aVto a very special friend of mine,
p116
aVone of the greatest double bassists I know.
p117
aVMr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take it for a walk. Come on, baby.
p118
aV(Music)
p119
aVAll right, ladies and gentlemen,
p120

p121
aVone of the greatest jazz legends of our time.
