VSo the first robot to talk about is called STriDER.
p4
aVIt stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.
p5
aVIt's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature.
p6
aVBut have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs?
p7
aVProbably not. So why do I call this a biologically inspired robot?
p8
aVHow would it work?
p9
aVBut before that, let's look at pop culture.
p10
aVSo, you know H.G. Wells's "War of the Worlds," novel and movie.
p11
aVAnd what you see over here is a very popular video game,
p12
aVand in this fiction, they describe these alien creatures and robots
p13
aVthat have three legs that terrorize Earth.
p14
aVBut my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is an actual dynamic simulation animation.
p17
aVI'm going to show you how the robot works.
p18
aVIt flips its body 180 degrees
p19
aVand it swings its leg between the two legs
p20
aVand catches the fall.
p21
aVSo that's how it walks.
p22
aVBut when you look at us human beings, bipedal walking,
p23
aVwhat you're doing is,
p24
aVyou're not really using muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot.
p25
aVWhat you're doing is, you swing your leg and catch the fall,
p26
aVstand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall.
p27
aVYou're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body,
p28
aVjust like a pendulum.
p29
aVWe call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.
p30
aVWhat you're doing is, when you stand up,
p31
aVpotential energy to kinetic energy,
p32
aVpotential energy to kinetic energy.
p33
aVIt's a constantly falling process.
p34
aVSo even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this,
p35
aVreally, we're inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking
p36
aVto this robot.
p37
aVThus, it's a biologically inspired robot.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat you see here, this is what we want to do next.
p40
aVWe want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
p41
aVAnd it deploys legs \u2014 it looks almost like "Star Wars" \u2014
p42
aVso when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
p43
aVWhat you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VThis is just to show you
p48
aVthat if you have cameras or different types of sensors,
p49
aVbecause it's 1.8 meters tall,
p50
aVyou can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo we have two prototypes.
p53
aVThe first version, in the back, that's STriDER I.
p54
aVThe one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II.
p55
aVThe problem we had with STriDER I is, it was just too heavy in the body.
p56
aVWe had so many motors aligning the joints
p57
aVand those kinds of things.
p58
aVSo we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism
p59
aVso we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor,
p60
aVwe can coordinate all the motions.
p61
aVIt's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics.
p62
aVSo with this, now the top body is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.
p63
aVThis was the very first successful step.
p64
aVIt's still not perfected, its coffee falls down,
p65
aVso we still have a lot of work to do.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS.
p68
aVIt stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
p69
aVIt's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
p70
aVSo think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel,
p71
aVbut the spokes individually move in and out of the hub;
p72
aVso, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
p73
aVWe're literally reinventing the wheel here.
p74
aVLet me demonstrate how it works.
p75
aVSo in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
p76
aVJust simply using the tactile sensors on the feet,
p77
aVit's trying to walk over a changing terrain,
p78
aVa soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
p79
aVAnd just by the tactile information,
p80
aVit successfully crosses over these types of terrains.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut, when it encounters a very extreme terrain \u2014
p83
aVin this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height
p84
aVof the robot \u2014
p85
aVthen it switches to a deliberate mode,
p86
aVwhere it uses a laser range finder and camera systems
p87
aVto identify the obstacle and the size.
p88
aVAnd it carefully plans the motion of the spokes
p89
aVand coordinates it so it can show this very impressive mobility.
p90
aVYou probably haven't seen anything like this out there.
p91
aVThis is a very high-mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS.
p92
aVAh, isn't that cool?
p93
aa(lp94
VWhen you drive your car,
p95
aVwhen you steer your car, you use a method called Ackermann steering.
p96
aVThe front wheels rotate like this.
p97
aVFor most small-wheeled robots,
p98
aVthey use a method called differential steering
p99
aVwhere the left and right wheel turn the opposite direction.
p100
aVFor IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion.
p101
aVFor example, in this case,
p102
aVeven though the left and right wheels are connected
p103
aVwith a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity,
p104
aVwe simply change the length of the spoke, it affects the diameter,
p105
aVthen can turn to the left and to the right.
p106
aVThese are just some examples of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis robot is called CLIMBeR:
p109
aVCable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot.
p110
aVI've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists \u2014
p111
aVat JPL, they are famous for the Mars rovers \u2014
p112
aVand the scientists, geologists always tell me
p113
aVthat the real interesting science, the science-rich sites,
p114
aVare always at the cliffs.
p115
aVBut the current rovers cannot get there.
p116
aVSo, inspired by that, we wanted to build a robot
p117
aVthat can climb a structured cliff environment.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo this is CLIMBeR.
p120
aVIt has three legs.
p121
aVIt's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top.
p122
aVIt tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
p123
aVAnd then once it figures that out,
p124
aVin real time, it calculates the force distribution:
p125
aVhow much force it needs to exert to the surface
p126
aVso it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
p127
aVOnce it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,
p128
aVand then with the winch, it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.
p129
aVAlso for search and rescue applications as well.
p130
aa(lp131
VFive years ago, I actually worked at NASA JPL
p132
aVduring the summer as a faculty fellow.
p133
aVAnd they already had a six-legged robot called LEMUR.
p134
aVSo this is actually based on that.
p135
aVThis robot is called MARS:
p136
aVMulti-Appendage Robotic System.
p137
aVIt's a hexapod robot.
p138
aVWe developed our adaptive gait planner.
p139
aVWe actually have a very interesting payload on there.
p140
aVThe students like to have fun.
p141
aVAnd here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Motor sound)
p144
aa(lp145
VIt's trying to walk on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,
p146
aVbut depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand,
p147
aVthe foot's soil sinkage model changes, so it tries to adapt its gait
p148
aVto successfully cross over these kind of things.
p149
aVIt also does some fun stuff.
p150
aVAs you can imagine, we get so many visitors visiting our lab.
p151
aVSo when the visitors come, MARS walks up to the computer,
p152
aVstarts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.
p153
aVWelcome to RoMeLa,
p154
aVthe Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech."
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VThis robot is an amoeba robot.
p159
aVNow, we don't have enough time to go into technical details,
p160
aVI'll just show you some of the experiments.
p161
aVThese are some of the early feasibility experiments.
p162
aVWe store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move,
p163
aVor use active tension cords to make it move forward and backward.
p164
aVIt's called ChIMERA.
p165
aVWe also have been working with some scientists and engineers
p166
aVfrom UPenn
p167
aVto come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot.
p168
aVWe do something to something,
p169
aVand just like magic, it moves.
p170
aV"The Blob."
p171
aa(lp172
VThis robot is a very recent project.
p173
aVIt's called RAPHaEL:
p174
aVRobotic Air-Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments.
p175
aVThere are a lot of really neat, very good robotic hands
p176
aVout there on the market.
p177
aVThe problem is, they're just too expensive \u2014
p178
aVtens of thousands of dollars.
p179
aVSo for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical,
p180
aVbecause it's not affordable.
p181
aVWe wanted to tackle this problem in a very different direction.
p182
aVInstead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators,
p183
aVwe're using compressed air.
p184
aVWe developed these novel actuators for the joints, so it's compliant.
p185
aVYou can actually change the force,
p186
aVsimply just changing the air pressure.
p187
aVAnd it can actually crush an empty soda can.
p188
aVIt can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg,
p189
aVor in this case, a lightbulb.
p190
aVThe best part: it took only 200 dollars to make the first prototype.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis robot is actually a family of snake robots
p193
aVthat we call HyDRAS,
p194
aVHyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine.
p195
aVThis is a robot that can climb structures.
p196
aVThis is a HyDRAS's arm.
p197
aVIt's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.
p198
aVBut the cool part is the user interface.
p199
aVThe cable over there, that's an optical fiber.
p200
aVThis student, it's probably her first time using it,
p201
aVbut she can articulate it in many different ways.
p202
aVSo, for example, in Iraq, the war zone, there are roadside bombs.
p203
aVCurrently, you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed.
p204
aVIt takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator
p205
aVto operate this complex arm.
p206
aVIn this case, it's very intuitive;
p207
aVthis student, probably his first time using it,
p208
aVis doing very complex manipulation tasks,
p209
aVpicking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that.
p210
aVVery intuitive.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, this robot is currently our star robot.
p213
aVWe actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn:
p214
aVDynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence.
p215
aVAs you know, we're very interested in human walking,
p216
aVso we decided to build a small humanoid robot.
p217
aVThis was in 2004; at that time,
p218
aVthis was something really, really revolutionary.
p219
aVThis was more of a feasibility study:
p220
aVWhat kind of motors should we use? Is it even possible?
p221
aVWhat kinds of controls should we do?
p222
aVThis does not have any sensors, so it's an open-loop control.
p223
aVFor those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors
p224
aVand there's any disturbances, you know what happens.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VBased on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design,
p229
aVstarting from kinematics.
p230
aVAnd thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
p231
aVIt stands up, it walks \u2014 very impressive.
p232
aVHowever, still, as you can see, it has a cord, an umbilical cord.
p233
aVSo we're still using an external power source
p234
aVand external computation.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo in 2006, now it's really time to have fun.
p237
aVLet's give it intelligence.
p238
aVWe give it all the computing power it needs:
p239
aVa 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip, two FireWire cameras,
p240
aVrate gyros, accelerometers, four forced sensors on the foot,
p241
aVlithium polymer batteries \u2014
p242
aVand now DARwIn II is completely autonomous.
p243
aVIt is not remote controlled. There's no tethers.
p244
aVIt looks around, searches for the ball ... looks around, searches for the ball,
p245
aVand it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously \u2014 artificial intelligence.
p246
aVLet's see how it does.
p247
aVThis was our very first trial, and ...
p248
aa(lp249
V(Video) Spectators: Goal!
p250
aa(lp251
VDennis Hong: There is actually a competition called RoboCup.
p252
aVI don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup.
p253
aVIt's an international autonomous robot soccer competition.
p254
aVAnd the actual goal of RoboCup is,
p255
aVby the year 2050,
p256
aVwe want to have full-size, autonomous humanoid robots
p257
aVplay soccer against the human World Cup champions
p258
aVand win.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VIt's a true, actual goal.
p263
aVIt's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe we can do it.
p264
aa(lp265
VThis is last year in China.
p266
aVWe were the very first team in the United States that qualified
p267
aVin the humanoid RoboCup competition.
p268
aVThis is this year in Austria.
p269
aVYou're going to see the action is three against three,
p270
aVcompletely autonomous.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Video) (Crowd groans)
p273
aa(lp274
VDH: There you go. Yes!
p275
aVThe robots track and they team-play amongst themselves.
p276
aVIt's very impressive.
p277
aVIt's really a research event,
p278
aVpackaged in a more exciting competition event.
p279
aVWhat you see here is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.
p280
aVThis is for the best humanoid.
p281
aVWe'd like to bring this, for the first time, to the United States next year,
p282
aVso wish us luck.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VDARwIn also has a lot of other talents.
p291
aVLast year, it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra
p292
aVfor the holiday concert.
p293
aVThis is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV,
p294
aVmuch smarter, faster, stronger.
p295
aVAnd it's trying to show off its ability:
p296
aV"I'm macho, I'm strong."
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
V"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements."
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.
p305
aVAgain, you'll be able to see it in the lobby.
p306
aVWe truly believe this will be the very first running humanoid robot
p307
aVin the United States.
p308
aVSo stay tuned.
p309
aa(lp310
VAll right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work.
p311
aVSo, what is the secret of our success?
p312
aVWhere do we come up with these ideas?
p313
aVHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?
p314
aVWe have a fully autonomous vehicle
p315
aVthat can drive into urban environments.
p316
aVWe won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge.
p317
aVWe also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
p318
aVWe call it the Blind Driver Challenge, very exciting.
p319
aVAnd many, many other robotics projects I want to talk about.
p320
aVThese are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall
p321
aVfrom robotics competitions and those kinds of things.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo really, we have five secrets.
p324
aVFirst is: Where do we get inspiration?
p325
aVWhere do we get this spark of imagination?
p326
aVThis is a true story, my personal story.
p327
aVAt night, when I go to bed, at three, four in the morning,
p328
aVI lie down, close my eyes, and I see these lines and circles
p329
aVand different shapes floating around.
p330
aVAnd they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms.
p331
aVAnd I think, "Ah, this is cool."
p332
aVSo right next to my bed I keep a notebook, a journal,
p333
aVwith a special pen that has an LED light on it,
p334
aVbecause I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo I see this, scribble everything down, draw things, and go to bed.
p337
aVEvery day in the morning, the first thing I do,
p338
aVbefore my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth,
p339
aVI open my notebook.
p340
aVMany times it's empty; sometimes I have something there.
p341
aVIf something's there, sometimes it's junk.
p342
aVBut most of the time, I can't read my handwriting.
p343
aVFour in the morning \u2014 what do you expect, right?
p344
aVSo I need to decipher what I wrote.
p345
aVBut sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there,
p346
aVand I have this eureka moment.
p347
aVI directly run to my home office, sit at my computer,
p348
aVI type in the ideas, I sketch things out
p349
aVand I keep a database of ideas.
p350
aVSo when we have these calls for proposals,
p351
aVI try to find a match between my potential ideas
p352
aVand the problem.
p353
aVIf there's a match, we write a research proposal,
p354
aVget the research funding in,
p355
aVand that's how we start our research programs.
p356
aa(lp357
VBut just a spark of imagination is not good enough.
p358
aVHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?
p359
aVAt our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory,
p360
aVwe have these fantastic brainstorming sessions.
p361
aVSo we gather around, we discuss problems and solutions and talk about it.
p362
aVBut before we start, we set this golden rule.
p363
aVThe rule is:
p364
aVnobody criticizes anybody's ideas.
p365
aVNobody criticizes any opinion.
p366
aVThis is important, because many times, students fear or feel uncomfortable
p367
aVabout how others might think about their opinions and thoughts.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo once you do this, it is amazing how the students open up.
p370
aVThey have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas,
p371
aVand the whole room is just electrified with creative energy.
p372
aVAnd this is how we develop our ideas.
p373
aa(lp374
VWell, we're running out of time.
p375
aVOne more thing I want to talk about is,
p376
aVyou know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough.
p377
aVThere was a great TED moment \u2014 I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?
p378
aVHe gave a talk about how education and school kill creativity.
p379
aVWell, actually, there's two sides to the story.
p380
aVSo there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas
p381
aVand creativity and good engineering intuition.
p382
aVIf you want to go beyond a tinkering,
p383
aVif you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics
p384
aVand really tackle the grand challenges of robotics
p385
aVthrough rigorous research,
p386
aVwe need more than that.
p387
aVThis is where school comes in.
p388
aa(lp389
VBatman, fighting against the bad guys,
p390
aVhe has his utility belt, he has his grappling hook,
p391
aVhe has all different kinds of gadgets.
p392
aVFor us roboticists, engineers and scientists,
p393
aVthese tools are the courses and classes you take in class.
p394
aVMath, differential equations.
p395
aVI have linear algebra, science, physics \u2014
p396
aVeven, nowadays, chemistry and biology, as you've seen.
p397
aVThese are all the tools we need.
p398
aVSo the more tools you have, for Batman,
p399
aVmore effective at fighting the bad guys,
p400
aVfor us, more tools to attack these kinds of big problems.
p401
aVSo education is very important.
p402
aa(lp403
VAlso \u2014 it's not only about that.
p404
aVYou also have to work really, really hard.
p405
aVSo I always tell my students,
p406
aV"Work smart, then work hard."
p407
aVThis picture in the back \u2014 this is three in the morning.
p408
aVI guarantee if you come to our lab at 3, 4am,
p409
aVwe have students working there,
p410
aVnot because I tell them to, but because we are having too much fun.
p411
aVWhich leads to the last topic:
p412
aVdo not forget to have fun.
p413
aVThat's really the secret of our success, we're having too much fun.
p414
aVI truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun,
p415
aVand that's what we're doing.
p416
aVAnd there you go.
p417
aa(lp418
