VScience.
p4
aVThe very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom
p5
aVin high school biology or physics class.
p6
aVBut let me assure that what you did there
p7
aVhad very little to do with science.
p8
aVThat was really the "what" of science.
p9
aVIt was the history of what other people had discovered.
p10
aVWhat I'm most interested in as a scientist
p11
aVis the "how" of science.
p12
aVBecause science is knowledge in process.
p13
aVWe make an observation, guess an explanation for that observation,
p14
aVand then make a prediction that we can test
p15
aVwith an experiment or other observation.
p16
aa(lp17
VA couple of examples.
p18
aVFirst of all, people noticed that the Earth was below, the sky above,
p19
aVand both the Sun and the Moon seemed to go around them.
p20
aVTheir guessed explanation
p21
aVwas that the Earth must be the center of the universe.
p22
aVThe prediction: everything should circle around the Earth.
p23
aVThis was first really tested
p24
aVwhen Galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes,
p25
aVand as he gazed into the night sky,
p26
aVwhat he found there was a planet, Jupiter,
p27
aVwith four moons circling around it.
p28
aVHe then used those moons to follow the path of Jupiter
p29
aVand found that Jupiter also was not going around the Earth
p30
aVbut around the Sun.
p31
aVSo the prediction test failed.
p32
aVAnd this led to the discarding of the theory
p33
aVthat the Earth was the center of the universe.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnother example: Sir Isaac Newton noticed that things fall to the Earth.
p36
aVThe guessed explanation was gravity,
p37
aVthe prediction that everything should fall to the Earth.
p38
aVBut of course, not everything does fall to the Earth.
p39
aVSo did we discard gravity?
p40
aVNo. We revised the theory and said, gravity pulls things to the Earth
p41
aVunless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction.
p42
aVThis led us to learn something new.
p43
aVWe began to pay more attention to the bird and the bird's wings,
p44
aVand just think of all the discoveries
p45
aVthat have flown from that line of thinking.
p46
aVSo the test failures, the exceptions, the outliers
p47
aVteach us what we don't know and lead us to something new.
p48
aVThis is how science moves forward. This is how science learns.
p49
aa(lp50
VSometimes in the media, and even more rarely,
p51
aVbut sometimes even scientists will say
p52
aVthat something or other has been scientifically proven.
p53
aVBut I hope that you understand that science never proves anything
p54
aVdefinitively forever.
p55
aVHopefully science remains curious enough
p56
aVto look for
p57
aVand humble enough to recognize
p58
aVwhen we have found
p59
aVthe next outlier,
p60
aVthe next exception,
p61
aVwhich, like Jupiter's moons,
p62
aVteaches us what we don't actually know.
p63
aa(lp64
VWe're going to change gears here for a second.
p65
aVThe caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,
p66
aVmeans a lot of different things to different people,
p67
aVbut most of our public discourse on medicine
p68
aVreally turns it into an engineering problem.
p69
aVWe have the hallways of Congress,
p70
aVand the boardrooms of insurance companies that try to figure out how to pay for it.
p71
aVThe ethicists and epidemiologists
p72
aVtry to figure out how best to distribute medicine,
p73
aVand the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed
p74
aVwith their protocols and checklists,
p75
aVtrying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine.
p76
aVThese are all good things.
p77
aVHowever, they also all assume
p78
aVat some level
p79
aVthat the textbook of medicine is closed.
p80
aVWe start to measure the quality of our health care
p81
aVby how quickly we can access it.
p82
aVIt doesn't surprise me that in this climate,
p83
aVmany of our institutions for the provision of health care
p84
aVstart to look a heck of a lot like Jiffy Lube.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe only problem is that when I graduated from medical school,
p89
aVI didn't get one of those little doohickeys
p90
aVthat your mechanic has to plug into your car
p91
aVand find out exactly what's wrong with it,
p92
aVbecause the textbook of medicine
p93
aVis not closed.
p94
aVMedicine is science.
p95
aVMedicine is knowledge in process.
p96
aVWe make an observation,
p97
aVwe guess an explanation of that observation,
p98
aVand then we make a prediction that we can test.
p99
aVNow, the testing ground of most predictions in medicine
p100
aVis populations.
p101
aVAnd you may remember from those boring days in biology class
p102
aVthat populations tend to distribute
p103
aVaround a mean
p104
aVas a Gaussian or a normal curve.
p105
aVTherefore, in medicine,
p106
aVafter we make a prediction from a guessed explanation,
p107
aVwe test it in a population.
p108
aVThat means that what we know in medicine,
p109
aVour knowledge and our know-how,
p110
aVcomes from populations
p111
aVbut extends only as far
p112
aVas the next outlier,
p113
aVthe next exception,
p114
aVwhich, like Jupiter's moons,
p115
aVwill teach us what we don't actually know.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, I am a surgeon
p118
aVwho looks after patients with sarcoma.
p119
aVSarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.
p120
aVIt's the cancer of flesh and bones.
p121
aVAnd I would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier,
p122
aVis an exception.
p123
aVThere is no surgery I have ever performed for a sarcoma patient
p124
aVthat has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial,
p125
aVwhat we consider the best kind of population-based evidence in medicine.
p126
aVPeople talk about thinking outside the box,
p127
aVbut we don't even have a box in sarcoma.
p128
aVWhat we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty
p129
aVand unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma
p130
aVis easy access to what I think are those two most important values
p131
aVfor any science:
p132
aVhumility and curiosity.
p133
aVBecause if I am humble and curious,
p134
aVwhen a patient asks me a question,
p135
aVand I don't know the answer,
p136
aVI'll ask a colleague
p137
aVwho may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.
p138
aVWe'll even establish international collaborations.
p139
aVThose patients will start to talk to each other through chat rooms
p140
aVand support groups.
p141
aVIt's through this kind of humbly curious communication
p142
aVthat we begin to try and learn new things.
p143
aa(lp144
VAs an example, this is a patient of mine
p145
aVwho had a cancer near his knee.
p146
aVBecause of humbly curious communication
p147
aVin international collaborations,
p148
aVwe have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee
p149
aVwhen we have to remove the knee with the cancer.
p150
aVHe can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play.
p151
aVThis opportunity was available to him
p152
aVbecause of international collaborations.
p153
aVIt was desirable to him
p154
aVbecause he had contacted other patients who had experienced it.
p155
aVAnd so exceptions and outliers in medicine
p156
aVteach us what we don't know, but also lead us to new thinking.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, very importantly,
p159
aVall the new thinking that outliers and exceptions lead us to in medicine
p160
aVdoes not only apply to the outliers and exceptions.
p161
aVIt is not that we only learn from sarcoma patients
p162
aVways to manage sarcoma patients.
p163
aVSometimes, the outliers
p164
aVand the exceptions
p165
aVteach us things that matter quite a lot to the general population.
p166
aVLike a tree standing outside a forest,
p167
aVthe outliers and the exceptions draw our attention
p168
aVand lead us into a much greater sense of perhaps what a tree is.
p169
aVWe often talk about losing the forests for the trees,
p170
aVbut one also loses a tree
p171
aVwithin a forest.
p172
aVBut the tree that stands out by itself
p173
aVmakes those relationships that define a tree,
p174
aVthe relationships between trunk and roots and branches,
p175
aVmuch more apparent.
p176
aVEven if that tree is crooked
p177
aVor even if that tree has very unusual relationships
p178
aVbetween trunk and roots and branches,
p179
aVit nonetheless draws our attention
p180
aVand allows us to make observations
p181
aVthat we can then test in the general population.
p182
aa(lp183
VI told you that sarcomas are rare.
p184
aVThey make up about one percent of all cancers.
p185
aVYou also probably know that cancer is considered a genetic disease.
p186
aVBy genetic disease we mean that cancer is caused by oncogenes
p187
aVthat are turned on in cancer
p188
aVand tumor suppressor genes that are turned off to cause cancer.
p189
aVYou might think that we learned about oncogenes
p190
aVand tumor suppressor genes from common cancers
p191
aVlike breast cancer and prostate cancer
p192
aVand lung cancer,
p193
aVbut you'd be wrong.
p194
aVWe learned about oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
p195
aVfor the first time
p196
aVin that itty-bitty little one percent of cancers called sarcoma.
p197
aVIn 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize
p198
aVfor realizing that chickens
p199
aVhad a transmissible form of sarcoma.
p200
aVThirty years later, Harold Varmus and Mike Bishop discovered
p201
aVwhat that transmissible element was.
p202
aVIt was a virus
p203
aVcarrying a gene,
p204
aVthe src oncogene.
p205
aVNow, I will not tell you that src is the most important oncogene.
p206
aVI will not tell you
p207
aVthat src is the most frequently turned on oncogene in all of cancer.
p208
aVBut it was the first oncogene.
p209
aVThe exception, the outlier
p210
aVdrew our attention and led us to something
p211
aVthat taught us very important things about the rest of biology.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, TP53 is the most important tumor suppressor gene.
p214
aVIt is the most frequently turned off tumor suppressor gene
p215
aVin almost every kind of cancer.
p216
aVBut we didn't learn about it from common cancers.
p217
aVWe learned about it when doctors Li and Fraumeni
p218
aVwere looking at families,
p219
aVand they realized that these families
p220
aVhad way too many sarcomas.
p221
aVI told you that sarcoma is rare.
p222
aVRemember that a one in a million diagnosis,
p223
aVif it happens twice in one family,
p224
aVis way too common in that family.
p225
aVThe very fact that these are rare
p226
aVdraws our attention
p227
aVand leads us to new kinds of thinking.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, many of you may say,
p230
aVand may rightly say,
p231
aVthat yeah, Kevin, that's great,
p232
aVbut you're not talking about a bird's wing.
p233
aVYou're not talking about moons floating around some planet Jupiter.
p234
aVThis is a person.
p235
aVThis outlier, this exception, may lead to the advancement of science,
p236
aVbut this is a person.
p237
aVAnd all I can say
p238
aVis that I know that all too well.
p239
aVI have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases.
p240
aVI write about these conversations.
p241
aVThese conversations are terribly fraught.
p242
aVThey're fraught with horrible phrases
p243
aVlike "I have bad news" or "There's nothing more we can do."
p244
aVSometimes these conversations turn on a single word:
p245
aV"terminal."
p246
aa(lp247
VSilence can also be rather uncomfortable.
p248
aVWhere the blanks are in medicine
p249
aVcan be just as important
p250
aVas the words that we use in these conversations.
p251
aVWhat are the unknowns?
p252
aVWhat are the experiments that are being done?
p253
aa(lp254
VDo this little exercise with me.
p255
aVUp there on the screen, you see this phrase, "no where."
p256
aVNotice where the blank is.
p257
aVIf we move that blank one space over
p258
aV"no where"
p259
aVbecomes "now here,"
p260
aVthe exact opposite meaning,
p261
aVjust by shifting the blank one space over.
p262
aa(lp263
VI'll never forget the night
p264
aVthat I walked into one of my patients' rooms.
p265
aVI had been operating long that day
p266
aVbut I still wanted to come and see him.
p267
aVHe was a boy I had diagnosed with a bone cancer a few days before.
p268
aVHe and his mother had been meeting with the chemotherapy doctors
p269
aVearlier that day,
p270
aVand he had been admitted to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.
p271
aVIt was almost midnight when I got to his room.
p272
aVHe was asleep, but I found his mother
p273
aVreading by flashlight
p274
aVnext to his bed.
p275
aVShe came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes.
p276
aVIt turned out that what she had been reading
p277
aVwas the protocol that the chemotherapy doctors
p278
aVhad given her that day.
p279
aVShe had memorized it.
p280
aVShe said, "Dr. Jones, you told me
p281
aVthat we don't always win
p282
aVwith this type of cancer,
p283
aVbut I've been studying this protocol, and I think I can do it.
p284
aVI think I can comply with these very difficult treatments.
p285
aVI'm going to quit my job. I'm going to move in with my parents.
p286
aVI'm going to keep my baby safe."
p287
aVI didn't tell her.
p288
aVI didn't stop to correct her thinking.
p289
aVShe was trusting in a protocol
p290
aVthat even if complied with,
p291
aVwouldn't necessarily save her son.
p292
aVI didn't tell her.
p293
aVI didn't fill in that blank.
p294
aVBut a year and a half later
p295
aVher boy nonetheless died of his cancer.
p296
aVShould I have told her?
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, many of you may say, "So what?
p299
aVI don't have sarcoma.
p300
aVNo one in my family has sarcoma.
p301
aVAnd this is all fine and well,
p302
aVbut it probably doesn't matter in my life."
p303
aVAnd you're probably right.
p304
aVSarcoma may not matter a whole lot in your life.
p305
aVBut where the blanks are in medicine
p306
aVdoes matter in your life.
p307
aa(lp308
VI didn't tell you one dirty little secret.
p309
aVI told you that in medicine, we test predictions in populations,
p310
aVbut I didn't tell you,
p311
aVand so often medicine never tells you
p312
aVthat every time an individual
p313
aVencounters medicine,
p314
aVeven if that individual is firmly embedded in the general population,
p315
aVneither the individual nor the physician knows
p316
aVwhere in that population the individual will land.
p317
aVTherefore, every encounter with medicine
p318
aVis an experiment.
p319
aVYou will be a subject
p320
aVin an experiment.
p321
aVAnd the outcome will be either a better or a worse result for you.
p322
aVAs long as medicine works well,
p323
aVwe're fine with fast service,
p324
aVbravado, brimmingly confident conversations.
p325
aVBut when things don't work well,
p326
aVsometimes we want something different.
p327
aa(lp328
VA colleague of mine removed a tumor from a patient's limb.
p329
aVHe was concerned about this tumor.
p330
aVIn our physician conferences, he talked about his concern
p331
aVthat this was a type of tumor
p332
aVthat had a high risk for coming back in the same limb.
p333
aVBut his conversations with the patient
p334
aVwere exactly what a patient might want:
p335
aVbrimming with confidence.
p336
aVHe said, "I got it all and you're good to go."
p337
aVShe and her husband were thrilled.
p338
aVThey went out, celebrated, fancy dinner, opened a bottle of champagne.
p339
aVThe only problem was a few weeks later,
p340
aVshe started to notice another nodule in the same area.
p341
aVIt turned out he hadn't gotten it all, and she wasn't good to go.
p342
aVBut what happened at this juncture absolutely fascinates me.
p343
aVMy colleague came to me and said,
p344
aV"Kevin, would you mind looking after this patient for me?"
p345
aVI said, "Why, you know the right thing to do as well as I do.
p346
aVYou haven't done anything wrong."
p347
aVHe said, "Please, just look after this patient for me."
p348
aVHe was embarrassed \u2014
p349
aVnot by what he had done,
p350
aVbut by the conversation that he had had,
p351
aVby the overconfidence.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo I performed a much more invasive surgery
p354
aVand had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards.
p355
aVI said, "Most likely I've gotten it all
p356
aVand you're most likely good to go,
p357
aVbut this is the experiment that we're doing.
p358
aVThis is what you're going to watch for.
p359
aVThis is what I'm going to watch for.
p360
aVAnd we're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work
p361
aVto get rid of your cancer."
p362
aVI can guarantee you, she and her husband
p363
aVdid not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me.
p364
aVBut she was now a scientist,
p365
aVnot only a subject in her experiment.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd so I encourage you
p368
aVto seek humility and curiosity
p369
aVin your physicians.
p370
aVAlmost 20 billion times each year,
p371
aVa person walks into a doctor's office,
p372
aVand that person becomes a patient.
p373
aVYou or someone you love will be that patient sometime very soon.
p374
aVHow will you talk to your doctors?
p375
aVWhat will you tell them?
p376
aVWhat will they tell you?
p377
aVThey cannot tell you
p378
aVwhat they do not know,
p379
aVbut they can tell you when they don't know
p380
aVif only you'll ask.
p381
aVSo please, join the conversation.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.
