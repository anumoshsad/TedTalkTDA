VI'd like you to come back with me for a moment
p4
aVto the 19th century,
p5
aVspecifically to June 24, 1833.
p6
aVThe British Association for the Advancement of Science
p7
aVis holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.
p8
aVIt's the first night of the meeting,
p9
aVand a confrontation is about to take place
p10
aVthat will change science forever.
p11
aa(lp12
VAn elderly, white-haired man stands up.
p13
aVThe members of the Association are shocked to realize
p14
aVthat it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
p15
aVwho hadn't even left his house in years until that day.
p16
aVThey're even more shocked by what he says.
p17
aa(lp18
V"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."
p19
aa(lp20
VColeridge felt that true philosophers like himself
p21
aVpondered the cosmos from their armchairs.
p22
aVThey were not mucking around in the fossil pits
p23
aVor conducting messy experiments with electrical piles
p24
aVlike the members of the British Association.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
p27
aVA young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up
p28
aVand quieted the audience.
p29
aVHe politely agreed that an appropriate name
p30
aVfor the members of the association did not exist.
p31
aa(lp32
V"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"
p33
aVhe said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,'
p34
aVwe may form 'scientist.'"
p35
aVThis was the first time the word scientist
p36
aVwas uttered in public,
p37
aVonly 179 years ago.
p38
aa(lp39
VI first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,
p40
aVand it kind of blew me away.
p41
aVI mean, how could the word scientist
p42
aVnot have existed until 1833?
p43
aVWhat were scientists called before?
p44
aVWhat had changed to make a new name necessary
p45
aVprecisely at that moment?
p46
aVPrior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world
p47
aVwere talented amateurs.
p48
aVThink of the country clergyman or squire
p49
aVcollecting his beetles or fossils,
p50
aVlike Charles Darwin, for example,
p51
aVor, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,
p52
aVwho was the literary companion
p53
aVto the Marquis of Lansdowne
p54
aVwhen he discovered oxygen.
p55
aVAfter this, they were scientists,
p56
aVprofessionals with a particular scientific method,
p57
aVgoals, societies and funding.
p58
aa(lp59
VMuch of this revolution can be traced to four men
p60
aVwho met at Cambridge University in 1812:
p61
aVCharles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.
p62
aVThese were brilliant, driven men
p63
aVwho accomplished amazing things.
p64
aVCharles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,
p65
aVinvented the first mechanical calculator
p66
aVand the first prototype of a modern computer.
p67
aVJohn Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,
p68
aVand, in his spare time, co-invented photography.
p69
aVI'm sure we could all be that productive
p70
aVwithout Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.
p71
aVRichard Jones became an important economist
p72
aVwho later influenced Karl Marx.
p73
aVAnd Whewell not only coined the term scientist,
p74
aVas well as the words anode, cathode and ion,
p75
aVbut spearheaded international big science
p76
aVwith his global research on the tides.
p77
aVIn the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,
p78
aVthe four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.
p79
aVThey talked about science
p80
aVand the need for a new scientific revolution.
p81
aVThey felt science had stagnated
p82
aVsince the days of the scientific revolution that had happened
p83
aVin the 17th century.
p84
aVIt was time for a new revolution,
p85
aVwhich they pledged to bring about,
p86
aVand what's so amazing about these guys is,
p87
aVnot only did they have these
p88
aVgrandiose undergraduate dreams,
p89
aVbut they actually carried them out,
p90
aVeven beyond their wildest dreams.
p91
aVAnd I'm going to tell you today
p92
aVabout four major changes to science these men made.
p93
aa(lp94
VAbout 200 years before,
p95
aVFrancis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,
p96
aVhad proposed an inductive scientific method.
p97
aVNow that's a method that starts from
p98
aVobservations and experiments
p99
aVand moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,
p100
aVwhich are always subject to revision or rejection
p101
aVshould new evidence arise.
p102
aVHowever, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters
p103
aVby arguing that the science of economics
p104
aVshould use a different, deductive method.
p105
aVThe problem was that an influential group at Oxford
p106
aVbegan arguing that because it worked so well in economics,
p107
aVthis deductive method ought to be applied
p108
aVto the natural sciences too.
p109
aVThe members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.
p110
aVThey wrote books and articles promoting inductive method
p111
aVin all the sciences
p112
aVthat were widely read by natural philosophers,
p113
aVuniversity students and members of the public.
p114
aVReading one of Herschel's books
p115
aVwas such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin
p116
aVthat he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life
p117
aVmade so deep an impression on me.
p118
aVIt made me wish to add my might
p119
aVto the accumulated store of natural knowledge."
p120
aVIt also shaped Darwin's scientific method,
p121
aVas well as that used by his peers.
p122
aV[Science for the public good]
p123
aa(lp124
VPreviously, it was believed that scientific knowledge
p125
aVought to be used for the good of the king or queen,
p126
aVor for one's own personal gain.
p127
aVFor example, ship captains needed to know
p128
aVinformation about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
p129
aVHarbormasters would gather this knowledge
p130
aVand sell it to the ship captains.
p131
aVThe philosophical breakfast club changed that,
p132
aVworking together.
p133
aVWhewell's worldwide study of the tides
p134
aVresulted in public tide tables and tidal maps
p135
aVthat freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge
p136
aVto all ship captains.
p137
aVHerschel helped by making tidal observations
p138
aVoff the coast of South Africa,
p139
aVand, as he complained to Whewell,
p140
aVhe was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.
p141
aVThe four men really helped each other in every way.
p142
aVThey also relentlessly lobbied the British government
p143
aVfor the money to build Babbage's engines
p144
aVbecause they believed these engines
p145
aVwould have a huge practical impact on society.
p146
aVIn the days before pocket calculators,
p147
aVthe numbers that most professionals needed \u2014
p148
aVbankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers \u2014
p149
aVwere to be found in lookup books like this,
p150
aVfilled with tables of figures.
p151
aVThese tables were calculated
p152
aVusing a fixed procedure over and over
p153
aVby part-time workers known as \u2014 and this is amazing \u2014 computers,
p154
aVbut these calculations were really difficult.
p155
aVI mean, this nautical almanac
p156
aVpublished the lunar differences for every month of the year.
p157
aVEach month required 1,365 calculations,
p158
aVso these tables were filled with mistakes.
p159
aVBabbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator
p160
aVdevised to accurately compute any of these tables.
p161
aVTwo models of his engine were built in the last 20 years
p162
aVby a team from the Science Museum of London
p163
aVusing his own plans.
p164
aVThis is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,
p165
aVand it calculates accurately. It actually works.
p166
aVLater, Babbage's analytical engine
p167
aVwas the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.
p168
aVIt had a separate memory and central processor.
p169
aVIt was capable of iteration, conditional branching
p170
aVand parallel processing,
p171
aVand it was programmable using punched cards,
p172
aVan idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.
p173
aVTragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day
p174
aVbecause most people thought that
p175
aVnon-human computers would have no usefulness
p176
aVfor the public.
p177
aV[New scientific institutions]
p178
aa(lp179
VFounded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London
p180
aVwas the foremost scientific society in England
p181
aVand even in the rest of the world.
p182
aVBy the 19th century, it had become
p183
aVa kind of gentleman's club
p184
aVpopulated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.
p185
aVThe members of the philosophical breakfast club
p186
aVhelped form a number of new scientific societies,
p187
aVincluding the British Association.
p188
aVThese new societies required
p189
aVthat members be active researchers publishing their results.
p190
aVThey reinstated the tradition of the Q&A
p191
aVafter scientific papers were read,
p192
aVwhich had been discontinued by the Royal Society
p193
aVas being ungentlemanly.
p194
aVAnd for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.
p195
aVMembers were encouraged to bring their wives,
p196
aVdaughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,
p197
aVand while the women were expected to attend
p198
aVonly the public lectures and the social events like this one,
p199
aVthey began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
p200
aVThe British Association would later be the first
p201
aVof the major national science organizations in the world
p202
aVto admit women as full members.
p203
aV[External funding for science]
p204
aa(lp205
VUp to the 19th century,
p206
aVnatural philosophers were expected to pay
p207
aVfor their own equipment and supplies.
p208
aVOccasionally, there were prizes,
p209
aVsuch as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,
p210
aVfor solving the so-called longitude problem,
p211
aVbut prizes were only given after the fact,
p212
aVwhen they were given at all.
p213
aVOn the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,
p214
aVthe British Association began to use the extra money
p215
aVgenerated by its meetings to give grants
p216
aVfor research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,
p217
aVshipbuilding, and many other areas.
p218
aVThese grants not only allowed
p219
aVless wealthy men to conduct research,
p220
aVbut they also encouraged thinking outside the box,
p221
aVrather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.
p222
aVEventually, the Royal Society
p223
aVand the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,
p224
aVand this has become \u2014 fortunately it's become \u2014
p225
aVa major part of the scientific landscape today.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo the philosophical breakfast club
p228
aVhelped invent the modern scientist.
p229
aVThat's the heroic part of their story.
p230
aVThere's a flip side as well.
p231
aVThey did not foresee at least one consequence
p232
aVof their revolution.
p233
aVThey would have been deeply dismayed
p234
aVby today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.
p235
aVIt's shocking to realize
p236
aVthat only 28 percent of American adults
p237
aVhave even a very basic level of science literacy,
p238
aVand this was tested by asking simple questions like,
p239
aV"Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"
p240
aVand "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"
p241
aVOnce scientists became members of a professional group,
p242
aVthey were slowly walled off from the rest of us.
p243
aVThis is the unintended consequence of the revolution
p244
aVthat started with our four friends.
p245
aa(lp246
VCharles Darwin said,
p247
aV"I sometimes think that general and popular treatises
p248
aVare almost as important for the progress of science
p249
aVas original work."
p250
aVIn fact, "Origin of Species" was written
p251
aVfor a general and popular audience,
p252
aVand was widely read when it first appeared.
p253
aVDarwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,
p254
aVthat science is not only for scientists.
p255
