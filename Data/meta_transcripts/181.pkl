VChris Anderson: Welcome to TED.
p4
aa(lp5
VRichard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.
p6
aa(lp7
VCA: Have you met anyone interesting?
p8
aa(lp9
VRB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
p10
aVI was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,
p11
aVbecause I had an apology to make to her.
p12
aVI'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd \u2014
p13
aVshe had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
p14
aVAnd I went home to my wife that night
p15
aVand she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,
p16
aVmassive, big wedding ring on my finger.
p17
aVAnd, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler
p18
aVand get it cut off.
p19
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p20
aVso apologies to Goldie.
p21
aa(lp22
VCA: That's pretty good.
p23
aVSo, we're going to put up some slides
p24
aVof some of your companies here.
p25
aVYou've started one or two in your time.
p26
aVSo, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records \u2014
p27
aVI guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
p28
aVAnd then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?
p29
aa(lp30
VRB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:
p31
aVyou must not talk about your own business, and this,
p32
aVand now you ask me.
p33
aVSo I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,
p34
aVsince you asked the question.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VCA: It depends what the answer is though.
p38
aa(lp39
VRB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,
p40
aVyou can really run any companies.
p41
aVI mean, companies are all about finding the right people,
p42
aVinspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.
p43
aVAnd I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive
p44
aVand I love taking on, you know, the status quo
p45
aVand trying to turn it upside down.
p46
aVSo I've seen life as one long learning process.
p47
aVAnd if I see \u2014 you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline
p48
aVand find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,
p49
aV21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create
p50
aVthe kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.
p51
aVAnd so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.
p52
aa(lp53
VCA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,
p54
aVbecause you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
p55
aVAnd in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
p56
aVI had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,
p57
aVat the time when you basically sold Virgin Records
p58
aVand invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,
p59
aVand his view was that you were trading, you know,
p60
aVthe world's fourth biggest record company
p61
aVfor the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
p62
aVWhy did you do that?
p63
aa(lp64
VRB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.
p65
aVAnd I think if you start a business without financial backing,
p66
aVyou're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
p67
aVWe had \u2014 we were being attacked by British Airways.
p68
aVThey were trying to put our airline out of business,
p69
aVand they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.
p70
aVAnd I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down
p71
aVunless I chipped in a chip.
p72
aVAnd in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,
p73
aVand protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,
p74
aVI had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.
p75
aa(lp76
VCA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,
p77
aVfor that as well.
p78
aa(lp79
VRB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
p80
aVBut, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.
p81
aa(lp82
VCA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot
p83
aVand it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.
p84
aVWhat does the brand stand for in your head?
p85
aa(lp86
VRB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,
p87
aVthat you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they \u2014
p88
aa(lp89
VCA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
p90
aa(lp91
VRB: No, but I was going to move on this.
p92
aVWe have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.
p93
aVAs I say, we go in and shake up other industries,
p94
aVand I think, you know, we do it differently
p95
aVand I think that industries are not quite the same
p96
aVas a result of Virgin attacking the market.
p97
aa(lp98
VCA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done
p99
aVwhere the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
p100
aVI mean, Virgin Brides \u2014 what happened there?
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VRB: We couldn't find any customers.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VCA: I was actually also curious why \u2014
p108
aVI think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
p109
aVI mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?
p110
aVAin't virgin no longer, or something.
p111
aa(lp112
VRB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.
p113
aVI mean, we had \u2014 often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,
p114
aVyou know, you can deal with them.
p115
aVBut about three months after the launch of the condom company,
p116
aVI had a letter, a complaint,
p117
aVand I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.
p118
aVBut obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.
p119
aVAnd then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,
p120
aVI got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby
p121
aVasking if I'd be godfather, which I became.
p122
aVSo, it all worked out well.
p123
aa(lp124
VCA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
p125
aa(lp126
VRB: I should have.
p127
aa(lp128
VCA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.
p129
aVI mean, what are the numbers on this?
p130
aVI mean, how big is the group overall?
p131
aVHow much \u2014 what's the total revenue?
p132
aa(lp133
VRB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
p134
aa(lp135
VCA: And how many employees?
p136
aa(lp137
VRB: About 55,000.
p138
aa(lp139
VCA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times
p140
aVand never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.
p141
aVWhat was that? Was that real?
p142
aa(lp143
VRB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
p144
aVNo, I mean, I think \u2014
p145
aVCA: But is that your hair?
p146
aVRB: No.
p147
aVCA: What was that one?
p148
aa(lp149
VRB: Dropping in for tea.
p150
aa(lp151
VCA: OK.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VRB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which \u2014
p155
aa(lp156
VCA: Oh, that car that we \u2014 actually we \u2014
p157
aVit was a TEDster event there, I think.
p158
aVIs that \u2014 could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VRB: It's a tough job, isn't it?
p162
aa(lp163
VCA: I mean, it is a tough job.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVWhen I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well
p166
aVand they kind of \u2014 they have these different rules over here,
p167
aVit's very strange.
p168
aa(lp169
VRB: I know, I have \u2014 the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
VCA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about \u2014
p172
aa(lp173
VRB: "Pammy" we launched, you know \u2014
p174
aVmistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,
p175
aVand we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy"
p176
aVand it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
p177
aVBut the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but \u2014
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VCA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?
p181
aa(lp182
VRB: Of course.
p183
aa(lp184
VCA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.
p185
aVAnd, OK, so stop there. This was \u2014 you had some award I think?
p186
aa(lp187
VRB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'
p188
aV"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected
p189
aVthat 25 years later \u2014 that she'd actually knight us.
p190
aVBut somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.
p191
aa(lp192
VCA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
p193
aVDo you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
p194
aa(lp195
VRB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.
p196
aVOccasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard
p197
aVand think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.
p198
aVBut nowhere else anyway.
p199
aa(lp200
VCA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
p201
aa(lp202
VRB: No. I suppose if you're having problems
p203
aVgetting a booking in a restaurant or something,
p204
aVthat might be worth using it.
p205
aa(lp206
VCA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.
p207
aa(lp208
VRB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
p209
aa(lp210
VCA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
p211
aVI think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,
p212
aVand Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)
p213
aVSo that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
p214
aa(lp215
VRB: Yeah, it'll be ready in \u2014 well, ready in 12 months
p216
aVand then we do 12 months extensive testing.
p217
aVAnd then 24 months from now,
p218
aVpeople will be able to take a ride into space.
p219
aa(lp220
VCA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?
p221
aa(lp222
VRB: Philippe has done the \u2014 yeah, quite a bit of it:
p223
aVthe logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.
p224
aVAnd basically, he's just taken an eye
p225
aVand the space station will be one giant eye,
p226
aVso when you're in space,
p227
aVyou ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.
p228
aVAnd when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.
p229
aVBut he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
p230
aa(lp231
VCA: But you didn't have him design the engine?
p232
aa(lp233
VRB: Philippe is quite erratic,
p234
aVso I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.
p235
aa(lp236
VCA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
p237
aa(lp238
VRB: Yeah? No, he is a \u2014
p239
aa(lp240
VCA: Well, some people found it wonderful,
p241
aVsome people found it completely bizarre.
p242
aVBut, I personally found it wonderful.
p243
aa(lp244
VRB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...
p245
aa(lp246
VCA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.
p247
aVHave you ever regretted that?
p248
aa(lp249
VRB: Many times.
p250
aVI mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.
p251
aVWell, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so \u2014
p252
aVand each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.
p253
aVSo in those moments,
p254
aVyou certainly wonder what you're doing up there or \u2014
p255
aa(lp256
VCA: What was the closest you got to \u2014
p257
aVwhen did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?
p258
aa(lp259
VRB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were \u2014 each one was,
p260
aVeach one, actually, I think we came close.
p261
aVAnd, I mean, first of all we \u2014
p262
aVnobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,
p263
aVso we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,
p264
aVand we weren't quite sure,
p265
aVwhen a balloon actually got into the jet stream,
p266
aVwhether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
p267
aVAnd so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,
p268
aVas we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon \u2014
p269
aVthe top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,
p270
aVthe capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,
p271
aVand it just took off.
p272
aVAnd it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
p273
aVAnd we were just crossing every finger,
p274
aVpraying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
p275
aVBut the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know \u2014
p276
aVsomething seemed to go wrong every time,
p277
aVand on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me
p278
aVjumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VCA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ...
p282
aa(lp283
VRB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,
p284
aVthe balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
p285
aa(lp286
VCA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
p287
aa(lp288
VRB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,
p289
aVwith my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,
p290
aVtrying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which \u2014
p291
aVand it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
p292
aVBut, anyway, we managed to survive it.
p293
aa(lp294
VCA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
p295
aa(lp296
VRB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,
p297
aVand I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,
p298
aVI would only have a couple of minutes of life left.
p299
aVSo I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried
p300
aVto make sure that I was making the right decision.
p301
aVAnd wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,
p302
aVlooked down at those clouds again,
p303
aVclimbed back into the capsule again.
p304
aVAnd then finally, just thought, there's a better way.
p305
aVI've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,
p306
aVit's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?
p307
aVAnd so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,
p308
aVand about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.
p309
aVAnd the balloon hit the sea
p310
aVand went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
p311
aVBut it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and \u2014
p312
aa(lp313
VCA: What did you write to your family?
p314
aa(lp315
VRB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:
p316
aVjust I love you very much. And
p317
aVI'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which \u2014
p318
aVjust in case anything had happened.
p319
aVBut fortunately, they never had to use it.
p320
aa(lp321
VCA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.
p322
aVThe years \u2014 and until I stopped looking at the polls,
p323
aVyou were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
p324
aVAnd cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy
p325
aVdoing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.
p326
aVHow much was the PR value part of this?
p327
aVRB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,
p328
aVthe last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,
p329
aVand crashing into the seas.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VCA: They have a point, Richard.
p333
aa(lp334
VRB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,
p335
aVyou know, come on, Richard,
p336
aVthere are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VCA: To do all this,
p340
aVyou must have been a genius from the get-go, right?
p341
aa(lp342
VRB: Well, I won't contradict that.
p343
aV(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VCA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.
p346
aa(lp347
VDidn't \u2014 weren't you just terrible at school?
p348
aa(lp349
VRB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.
p350
aVI certainly would have failed IQ tests.
p351
aVAnd it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
p352
aVAnd if I \u2014 if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.
p353
aVAs somebody who's dyslexic,
p354
aVyou also have some quite bizarre situations.
p355
aVI mean, for instance, I've had to \u2014 you know,
p356
aVI've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,
p357
aVbut haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.
p358
aVAnd so the board meetings have been fascinating.
p359
aV(Laughter)
p360
aVAnd so, it's like, good news or bad news?
p361
aVAnd generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
p362
aa(lp363
VCA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VRB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having \u2014
p367
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p368
aVI've got it right.
p369
aa(lp370
VCA: No, trust me, it's gross.
p371
aV(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VRB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,
p374
aV"Look Richard, here's a \u2014 let me draw on a diagram.
p375
aVHere's a net in the sea,
p376
aVand the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.
p377
aVAnd that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,
p378
aVeverything else is eaten."
p379
aVAnd I finally worked it all out.
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aV(Applause)
p382
aa(lp383
VCA: But, I mean, at school \u2014 so as well as being,
p384
aVyou know, doing pretty miserably academically,
p385
aVbut you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.
p386
aVSo you were kind of a \u2014 you were a natural leader,
p387
aVbut just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...
p388
aa(lp389
VRB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and \u2014 but I ... And I was,
p390
aVyeah, I was fortunately good at sport,
p391
aVand so at least I had something to excel at, at school.
p392
aa(lp393
VCA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.
p394
aVI mean, there's the story about your mother
p395
aVallegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home."
p396
aVDid this really happen?
p397
aa(lp398
VRB: She was, you know,
p399
aVshe felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
p400
aVSo she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,
p401
aVsuch as pushing us out of the car,
p402
aVand telling us to find our own way to Granny's,
p403
aVabout five miles before we actually got there.
p404
aVAnd making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.
p405
aVAnd we were never allowed to watch television and the like.
p406
aa(lp407
VCA: But is there a risk here?
p408
aVI mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,
p409
aVand we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
p410
aVDo you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think
p411
aVthey're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,
p412
aVwe're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
p413
aa(lp414
VRB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,
p415
aVyou just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.
p416
aVSo I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...
p419
aVYour headmaster said to you \u2014
p420
aVI mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school \u2014
p421
aVhe said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,
p422
aVand I'm not sure which.
p423
aVWhich of those happened first?
p424
aV(Laughter)
p425
aa(lp426
VRB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.
p427
aVI was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
p428
aVI was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act
p429
aVand the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.
p430
aVOn the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which \u2014
p431
aVwe had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
p432
aVAnd one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
p433
aVAnd there's an ancient law that says
p434
aVyou can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
p435
aVSo the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us
p436
aVif we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
p437
aVWe changed it to social diseases
p438
aVand people came along with acne and spots,
p439
aVbut nobody came with VD any more.
p440
aVSo, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
p441
aVAnd then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"
p442
aVthe word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested
p443
aVfor using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.
p444
aVAnd John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
p445
aVAnd he asked if I could find a linguistics expert
p446
aVto come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
p447
aVAnd so I rang up Nottingham University,
p448
aVand I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
p449
aVAnd he said, "Look, bollocks is not a \u2014 has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.
p450
aVIt's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."
p451
aV(Laughter)
p452
aVAnd he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."
p453
aVAnd so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?"
p454
aVAnd he said he'd be delighted. And I said \u2014
p455
aVand he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"
p456
aVAnd I said, "Yes, definitely. Please."
p457
aV(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VCA: That's great.
p460
aa(lp461
VRB: So our key witness argued that it was actually
p462
aV"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."
p463
aV(Laughter)
p464
aVAnd the judge found us \u2014 reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...
p465
aV(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VCA: That is outrageous.
p468
aV(Applause)
p469
aVSo seriously, is there a dark side?
p470
aVA lot of people would say there's no way
p471
aVthat someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses
p472
aVwithout knifing a few people in the back,
p473
aVyou know, doing some ugly things.
p474
aVYou've been accused of being ruthless.
p475
aVThere was a nasty biography written about you by someone.
p476
aVIs any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?
p477
aa(lp478
VRB: I don't actually think that the stereotype
p479
aVof a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,
p480
aVgenerally speaking, works.
p481
aVI think if you treat people well,
p482
aVpeople will come back and come back for more.
p483
aVAnd I think all you have in life is your reputation
p484
aVand it's a very small world.
p485
aVAnd I actually think that the best way
p486
aVof becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,
p487
aVand I like to think that's how we run Virgin.
p488
aa(lp489
VCA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending \u2014
p490
aVyou keep getting caught up in these new projects,
p491
aVbut it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.
p492
aVYou get excited by an idea and, kapow!
p493
aVI mean, do you think about life balance?
p494
aVHow do your family feel about
p495
aVeach time you step into something big and new?
p496
aa(lp497
VRB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,
p498
aVso from the time the kids were very young,
p499
aVyou know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.
p500
aVAnd so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
p501
aVYes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,
p502
aVwe have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can \u2014
p503
aVso I can take them there and we can bring friends,
p504
aVand we can play together,
p505
aVbut I can also keep in touch with what's going on.
p506
aa(lp507
VCA: You started talking in recent years
p508
aVabout this term capitalist philanthropy.
p509
aVWhat is that?
p510
aa(lp511
VRB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.
p512
aVYou know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.
p513
aVBut the problem with capitalism is
p514
aVextreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,
p515
aVand therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
p516
aVAnd I think it's important that the individuals,
p517
aVwho are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing
p518
aVfor bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,
p519
aVbut, you know, use that money to either create new jobs
p520
aVor to tackle issues around the world.
p521
aa(lp522
VCA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,
p523
aVwant to turn your resources toward?
p524
aa(lp525
VRB: Well, there's \u2014 I mean there's a lot of issues.
p526
aVI mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
p527
aVand we are putting a lot of time and energy into,
p528
aVA, trying to come up with alternative fuels
p529
aVand, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize
p530
aVin case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,
p531
aVin case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions
p532
aVcut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.
p533
aVWe need to try to encourage people to come up with a way
p534
aVof extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.
p535
aVAnd we just \u2014 you know, there weren't really people
p536
aVworking on that before, so we wanted people to try to \u2014
p537
aVall the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,
p538
aVand also to try to extract the methane
p539
aVout of the Earth's atmosphere as well.
p540
aVAnd actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms
p541
aVsaying they want to give it a go.
p542
aVAnd so we only need one, so we're hopeful.
p543
aa(lp544
VCA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?
p545
aa(lp546
VRB: Yes, I mean, we've got \u2014 we're setting up something called
p547
aVthe war room, which is maybe the wrong word.
p548
aVWe're trying to \u2014 maybe we'll change it \u2014 but anyway, it's a war room
p549
aVto try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,
p550
aVall the different social problems in Africa,
p551
aVand try to look at best practices.
p552
aVSo, for instance,
p553
aVthere's a doctor in Africa that's found that
p554
aVif you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,
p555
aVthat the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
p556
aVAnd so disseminating that information to
p557
aVaround the rest of Africa is important.
p558
aa(lp559
VCA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
p560
aVAnd is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West
p561
aVget so excited about \u2014 I mean, they're used to having an idea,
p562
aVgetting stuff done, and they believe profoundly
p563
aVin their ability to make a difference in the world.
p564
aVIs there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,
p565
aVwe've got to fix this problem and we can do it,
p566
aVI've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da \u2014
p567
aVhere's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation
p568
aVand actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?
p569
aa(lp570
VRB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually \u2014
p571
aVwe're working with the government on it.
p572
aVI mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting
p573
aVHIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,
p574
aVof him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,
p575
aVit's a way of working with him, with his government.
p576
aVIt's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,
p577
aVthey don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.
p578
aVIt's got to be consistent.
p579
aVBut I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how
p580
aVand help governments approach things slightly differently.
p581
aVFor instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa
p582
aVwhere we're going to be giving
p583
aVfree antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment
p584
aVand free malaria treatment.
p585
aVBut we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,
p586
aVso that people pay for some other aspects.
p587
aa(lp588
VCA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,
p589
aVor whatever, that this is really being \u2014 it's almost driven by
p590
aVsome sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,
p591
aVfor guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.
p592
aVWhat would you say to them?
p593
aa(lp594
VRB: Well, I think that everybody \u2014
p595
aVpeople do things for a whole variety of different reasons
p596
aVand I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,
p597
aVI will want to feel that I've made a difference
p598
aVto other people's lives.
p599
aVAnd that may be a selfish thing to think,
p600
aVbut it's the way I've been brought up.
p601
aVI think if I'm in a position to
p602
aVradically change other people's lives for the better,
p603
aVI should do so.
p604
aa(lp605
VCA: How old are you?
p606
aa(lp607
VRB: I'm 56.
p608
aa(lp609
VCA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that \u2014 as I understand him
p610
aVand I'm a total amateur \u2014 but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by
p611
aVthis desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.
p612
aV50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom
p613
aVand a search for legacy.
p614
aVI mean, it seems like you're still
p615
aVa little bit in the growth phases,
p616
aVyou're still doing these incredible new plans.
p617
aVHow much do you think about legacy,
p618
aVand what would you like your legacy to be?
p619
aa(lp620
VRB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.
p621
aVI mean, I like to \u2014 you know, my grandmother lived to 101,
p622
aVso hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.
p623
aVNo, I just want to live life to its full.
p624
aVYou know, if I can make a difference,
p625
aVI hope to be able to make a difference.
p626
aVAnd I think one of the positive things at the moment is
p627
aVyou've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,
p628
aVwho are good friends.
p629
aVAnd, thank God, you've got two people
p630
aVwho genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
p631
aVIf they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,
p632
aVit would be very worrying.
p633
aVAnd you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
p634
aVAnd I think it's important
p635
aVthat people in that kind of position do make a difference.
p636
aa(lp637
VCA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,
p638
aVI knew nothing about it and I also was sort of \u2014
p639
aVI thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless
p640
aVand that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
p641
aVAnd you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,
p642
aVwell, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.
p643
aVSo I would like to thank you for that inspiration,
p644
aVand for coming to TED today. Thank you.
p645
aVThank you so much.
