VI'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,
p4
aVbecause we've got to get better at security
p5
aVin this 21st century.
p6
aa(lp7
VLet me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,
p8
aVand kind of get a sense of how that style of security
p9
aVworked for us.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is Verdun, a battlefield in France
p12
aVjust north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.
p13
aVAt Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,
p14
aV700,000 people were killed,
p15
aVso about 2,000 a day.
p16
aa(lp17
VIf you roll it forward \u2014 20th-century security \u2014
p18
aVinto the Second World War,
p19
aVyou see the Battle of Stalingrad,
p20
aV300 days, 2 million people killed.
p21
aa(lp22
VWe go into the Cold War, and we continue
p23
aVto try and build walls.
p24
aVWe go from the trench warfare of the First World War
p25
aVto the Maginot Line of the Second World War,
p26
aVand then we go into the Cold War,
p27
aVthe Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.
p28
aVWalls don't work.
p29
aa(lp30
VMy thesis for us today is, instead of building walls
p31
aVto create security, we need to build bridges.
p32
aVThis is a famous bridge in Europe.
p33
aVIt's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
p34
aVIt's the bridge over the Drina River,
p35
aVthe subject of a novel by Ivo Andri\u0107,
p36
aVand it talks about how,
p37
aVin that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans,
p38
aVover time there's been enormous building of walls.
p39
aVMore recently, in the last decade, we begin to see
p40
aVthese communities start, hesitatingly,
p41
aVto come together.
p42
aa(lp43
VI would argue, again, open-source security
p44
aVis about connecting the international,
p45
aVthe interagency, the private-public,
p46
aVand lashing it together with strategic communication,
p47
aVlargely in social networks.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that,
p50
aVbecause our global commons is under attack
p51
aVin a variety of ways,
p52
aVand none of the sources of threat to the global commons
p53
aVwill be solved by building walls.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, I'm a sailor, obviously.
p56
aVThis is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.
p57
aVWhat's wrong with this picture?
p58
aVIt's got concertina wire along the sides of it.
p59
aVThat's to prevent pirates from attacking it.
p60
aVPiracy is a very active threat today
p61
aVaround the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.
p62
aVPiracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
p63
aVIt's active in the Gulf of Guinea.
p64
aVWe see it in the Caribbean.
p65
aVIt's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity
p66
aVin the global transport system.
p67
aVLast year, at this time, there were 20 vessels,
p68
aV500 mariners held hostage.
p69
aVThis is an attack on the global commons.
p70
aVWe need to think about how to address it.
p71
aa(lp72
VLet's shift to a different kind of sea,
p73
aVthe cyber sea.
p74
aVHere are photographs of two young men.
p75
aVAt the moment, they're incarcerated.
p76
aVThey conducted a credit card fraud that netted them
p77
aVover 10 billion dollars.
p78
aVThis is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year
p79
aVdiscontinuity in the global economy.
p80
aVTwo trillion a year.
p81
aVThat's just under the GDP of Great Britain.
p82
aVSo this cyber sea, which we know endlessly
p83
aVis the fundamental piece of radical openness,
p84
aVis very much under threat as well.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnother thing I worry about in the global commons
p87
aVis the threat posed by trafficking,
p88
aVby the movement of narcotics, opium,
p89
aVhere coming out of Afghanistan through Europe
p90
aVover to the United States.
p91
aVWe worry about cocaine
p92
aVcoming from the Andean Ridge north.
p93
aVWe worry about the movement of illegal weapons
p94
aVand trafficking. Above all, perhaps,
p95
aVwe worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.
p96
aVTrafficking moves largely at sea
p97
aVbut in other parts of the global commons.
p98
aa(lp99
VThis is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you
p100
aVthat this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear
p101
aVthat we're using to stop the trafficking.
p102
aVThe bad news is,
p103
aVthis is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.
p104
aVIt was built in the jungles of South America.
p105
aVWe caught it with that low-tech raft \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p106
aVand it was carrying six tons of cocaine.
p107
aVCrew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.
p108
aVThis kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons,
p109
aVGod forbid, in weapons of mass destruction,
p110
aVis part of the threat to the global commons.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.
p113
aVThis is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.
p114
aVEighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy,
p115
aVopium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.
p116
aVWe also see there, of course, terrorism.
p117
aVThis is where al Qaeda is staged from.
p118
aVWe also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.
p119
aVSo this terrorism concern is also part
p120
aVof the global commons, and what we must address.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo here we are, 21st century.
p123
aVWe know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.
p124
aVWhat should we do?
p125
aa(lp126
VI would argue that we will not deliver security
p127
aVsolely from the barrel of a gun.
p128
aVWe will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.
p129
aVWe will need the application of military force.
p130
aVWhen we do it, we must do it well, and competently.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut my thesis is, open-source security is about international,
p133
aVinteragency, private-public connection pulled together
p134
aVby this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.
p135
aa(lp136
VLet me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.
p137
aVThis is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.
p138
aVThey are all holding books.
p139
aVYou should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that
p140
aVthis demographic, young men and women
p141
aVin their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."
p142
aa(lp143
VYou would be correct.
p144
aa(lp145
VEighty-five percent cannot read
p146
aVwhen they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.
p147
aVWhy? Because the Taliban withheld education
p148
aVduring the period of time in which these men and women
p149
aVwould have learned to read.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo the question is, so,
p152
aVwhy are they all standing there holding books?
p153
aVThe answer is, we are teaching them to read
p154
aVin literacy courses by NATO
p155
aVin partnership with private sector entities,
p156
aVin partnership with development agencies.
p157
aVWe've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces
p158
aVto read and write at a basic level.
p159
aa(lp160
VWhen you can read and write in Afghanistan,
p161
aVyou will typically put a pen in your pocket.
p162
aVAt the ceremonies, when these young men and women
p163
aVgraduate, they take that pen with great pride,
p164
aVand put it in their pocket.
p165
aVThis is bringing together international
p166
aV\u2014 there are 50 nations involved in this mission \u2014
p167
aVinteragency \u2014 these development agencies \u2014
p168
aVand private-public, to take on this kind of security.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course,
p171
aVbut I would argue, open-source security
p172
aVmeans connecting in ways that create
p173
aVlonger lasting security effect.
p174
aa(lp175
VHere's another example.
p176
aVThis is a US Navy warship.
p177
aVIt's called the Comfort.
p178
aVThere's a sister ship called the Mercy.
p179
aVThey are hospital ships.
p180
aVThis one, the Comfort, operates throughout
p181
aVthe Caribbean and the coast of South America
p182
aVconducting patient treatments.
p183
aVOn a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.
p184
aVIt is crewed not strictly by military
p185
aVbut by a combination of humanitarian organizations:
p186
aVOperation Hope, Project Smile.
p187
aVOther organizations send volunteers.
p188
aVInteragency physicians come out.
p189
aVThey're all part of this.
p190
aa(lp191
VTo give you one example of the impact this can have,
p192
aVthis little boy, eight years old,
p193
aVwalked with his mother two days
p194
aVto come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.
p195
aVWhen he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes,
p196
aVhe suddenly looked up and said,
p197
aV"Mama, veo el mundo."
p198
aV"Mom, I see the world."
p199
aVMultiply this by 400,000 patient treatments,
p200
aVthis private-public collaboration with security forces,
p201
aVand you begin to see the power
p202
aVof creating security in a very different way.
p203
aa(lp204
VHere you see baseball players.
p205
aVCan you pick out the two US Army soldiers
p206
aVin this photograph?
p207
aVThey are the two young men on either side
p208
aVof these young boys. This is part of a series
p209
aVof baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration
p210
aVbetween Major League Baseball,
p211
aVthe Department of State,
p212
aVwho sets up the diplomatic piece of this,
p213
aVmilitary baseball players, who are real soldiers
p214
aVwith real skills but participate in this mission,
p215
aVand they put on clinics
p216
aVthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean,
p217
aVin Honduras, in Nicaragua,
p218
aVin all of the Central American and Caribbean nations
p219
aVwhere baseball is so popular,
p220
aVand it creates security.
p221
aVIt shows role models to young men and women
p222
aVabout fitness and about life that I would argue
p223
aVhelp create security for us.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnother aspect of this partnership
p226
aVis in disaster relief.
p227
aVThis is a US Air Force helicopter participating
p228
aVafter the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.
p229
aVIn each of these major disasters \u2014 the tsunami in 2004,
p230
aV250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005,
p231
aV85,000 dead,
p232
aVthe Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead,
p233
aVmore recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination
p234
aVwhich struck Japan and its nuclear industry \u2014
p235
aVin all of these instances, we see partnerships
p236
aVbetween international actors,
p237
aVinteragency, private-public working with security forces
p238
aVto respond to this kind of natural disaster.
p239
aVSo these are examples of this idea of open-source security.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.
p242
aVNow, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral,
p243
aVthese must be sea lanes of communication,
p244
aVor these might be fiber optic cables."
p245
aVNo. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.
p246
aVPurple are tweets. Green are geolocation.
p247
aVWhite is the synthesis.
p248
aVIt's a perfect evocation of that great population survey,
p249
aVthe six largest nations in the world in descending order:
p250
aVChina, India, Facebook, the United States,
p251
aVTwitter and Indonesia. (Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VWhy do we want to get in these nets?
p254
aVWhy do we want to be involved?
p255
aVWe talked earlier about the Arab Spring,
p256
aVand the power of all this.
p257
aVI'll give you another example,
p258
aVand it's how you move this message.
p259
aa(lp260
VI gave a talk like this in London a while back
p261
aVabout this point. I said, as I say to all of you,
p262
aVI'm on Facebook. Friend me.
p263
aVGot a little laugh from the audience.
p264
aVThere was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.
p265
aVGot picked up in two places in the world:
p266
aVFinland and Indonesia.
p267
aVThe headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aVThank you. (Applause)
p270
aVWhich I do. (Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd the story was a catalyst,
p273
aVand the next morning I had hundreds
p274
aVof Facebook friend requests
p275
aVfrom Indonesians and Finns,
p276
aVmostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend,
p277
aVand oh, by the way, what is NATO?" (Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo ... (Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VYeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message,
p282
aVand moving that message is how we connect
p283
aVinternational, interagency, private-public,
p284
aVand these social nets to help create security.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, let me hit a somber note.
p287
aVThis is a photograph of a brave British soldier.
p288
aVHe's in the Scots Guards.
p289
aVHe's standing the watch in Helmand,
p290
aVin southern Afghanistan.
p291
aVI put him here to remind us,
p292
aVI would not want anyone to leave the room thinking
p293
aVthat we do not need capable, competent militaries
p294
aVwho can create real military effect.
p295
aVThat is the core of who we are and what we do,
p296
aVand we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech,
p297
aVall the things we treasure in our societies.
p298
aa(lp299
VBut, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.
p300
aVYou don't have to have a military that is either
p301
aVin hard combat or is in the barracks.
p302
aa(lp303
VI would argue life is a rheostat.
p304
aVYou have to dial it in,
p305
aVand as I think about how we create security
p306
aVin this 21st century, there will be times
p307
aVwhen we will apply hard power in true war and crisis,
p308
aVbut there will be many instances,
p309
aVas we've talked about today,
p310
aVwhere our militaries can be part of creating
p311
aV21st-century security, international,
p312
aVinteragency, private-public,
p313
aVconnected with competent communication.
p314
aa(lp315
VI would close by saying that we heard earlier today
p316
aVabout Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time
p317
aVto look up facts, and as all of you appreciate,
p318
aVWikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people
p319
aVlocked in a room writing articles.
p320
aVWikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people
p321
aVinputting information, and every day millions of people
p322
aVwithdrawing that information.
p323
aVIt's a perfect image for the fundamental point
p324
aVthat no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
p325
aVNo one person, no one alliance, no one nation,
p326
aVno one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple:
p329
aVa world in which every human being can freely share
p330
aVin the sum of all knowledge.
p331
aVMy thesis for you is that by combining international,
p332
aVinteragency, private-public, strategic communication,
p333
aVtogether, in this 21st century,
p334
aVwe can create the sum of all security.
p335
aa(lp336
VThank you. (Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
