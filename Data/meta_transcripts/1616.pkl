VLiving with a physical disability isn't easy
p4
aVanywhere in the world,
p5
aVbut if you live in a country like the United States,
p6
aVthere's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier.
p7
aVSo if you're in a building, you can take an elevator.
p8
aVIf you're crossing the street, you have sidewalk cutouts.
p9
aVAnd if you have to travel some distance farther
p10
aVthan you can do under your own power, there's accessible vehicles,
p11
aVand if you can't afford one of those,
p12
aVthere's accessible public transportation.
p13
aVBut in the developing world, things are quite different.
p14
aVThere's 40 million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one,
p15
aVand the majority of these people live in rural areas,
p16
aVwhere the only connections to community, to employment, to education,
p17
aVare by traveling long distances on rough terrain
p18
aVoften under their own power.
p19
aVAnd the devices usually available to these people
p20
aVare not made for that context, break down quickly,
p21
aVand are hard to repair.
p22
aVI started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in 2005,
p23
aVwhen I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania,
p24
aVand I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair manufacturers, disability groups,
p25
aVand what stood out to me
p26
aVis that there wasn't a device available
p27
aVthat was designed for rural areas, that could go fast
p28
aVand efficiently on many types of terrain.
p29
aVSo being a mechanical engineer,
p30
aVbeing at MIT and having lots of resources available to me,
p31
aVI thought I'd try to do something about it.
p32
aVNow when you're talking about trying to travel
p33
aVlong distances on rough terrain,
p34
aVI immediately thought of a mountain bike,
p35
aVand a mountain bike's good at doing this
p36
aVbecause it has a gear train,
p37
aVand you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill
p38
aVor go through mud or sand
p39
aVand you get a lot of torque but a low speed.
p40
aVAnd if you want to go faster, say on pavement,
p41
aVyou can shift to a high gear,
p42
aVand you get less torque, but higher speeds.
p43
aVSo the logical evolution here
p44
aVis to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components,
p45
aVwhich many people have done.
p46
aVBut these are two products available in the U.S. that
p47
aVwould be difficult to transfer into developing countries
p48
aVbecause they're much, much too expensive.
p49
aVAnd the context I'm talking about is where
p50
aVyou need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars.
p51
aVAnd this ideal product would also be able to go
p52
aVabout five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school,
p53
aVand do it on many, many different types of terrain.
p54
aVBut when you get home or want to go indoors at your work,
p55
aVit's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
p56
aVAnd furthermore, if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas,
p57
aVit has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge
p58
aVin those contexts.
p59
aVSo the real crux of the problem here is,
p60
aVhow do you make a system that's a simple device
p61
aVbut gives you a large mechanical advantage?
p62
aVHow do you make a mountain bike for your arms
p63
aVthat doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity?
p64
aVSo as is the case with simple solutions,
p65
aVoftentimes the answer is right in front of your face, and for us it was levers.
p66
aVWe use levers all the time, in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.
p67
aVAnd that moment of inspiration, that key invention moment,
p68
aVwas when I was sitting in front of my design notebook
p69
aVand I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever,
p70
aVand if they grab near the end of the lever,
p71
aVthey can get an effectively long lever
p72
aVand produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth,
p73
aVand effectively get a low gear.
p74
aVAnd as they slide their hand down the lever,
p75
aVthey can push with a smaller effective lever length,
p76
aVbut push through a bigger angle every stroke,
p77
aVwhich makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.
p78
aVSo what's exciting about this system
p79
aVis that it's really, really mechanically simple,
p80
aVand you could make it using technology
p81
aVthat's been around for hundreds of years.
p82
aVSo seeing this in practice,
p83
aVthis is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,
p84
aVafter a few years of development,
p85
aVwe're now going into production with,
p86
aVand this is a full-time wheelchair user \u2014
p87
aVhe's paralyzed \u2014 in Guatemala,
p88
aVand you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain.
p89
aVAgain, the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast,
p90
aVhe just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke,
p91
aVand as the going gets tougher, he just slides his hands up the levers,
p92
aVcreates more torque, and kind of bench-presses his way
p93
aVout of trouble through the rough terrain.
p94
aVNow the big, important point here is that
p95
aVthe person is the complex machine in this system.
p96
aVIt's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers,
p97
aVso the mechanism itself can be very simple
p98
aVand composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world.
p99
aVBecause those bicycle parts
p100
aVare so ubiquitously available, they're super-cheap.
p101
aVThey're made by the gazillions in China and India,
p102
aVand we can source them anywhere in the world,
p103
aVbuild the chair anywhere, and most importantly repair it,
p104
aVeven out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic
p105
aVwho has local tools, knowledge and parts available.
p106
aVNow, when you want to use the LFC indoors,
p107
aVall you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain,
p108
aVstow them in the frame, and it converts into a normal wheelchair
p109
aVthat you can use just like any other normal wheelchair,
p110
aVand we sized it like a normal wheelchair,
p111
aVso it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway,
p112
aVit's low enough to fit under a table,
p113
aVand it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom
p114
aVand this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet,
p115
aVand be able to transfer off
p116
aVjust like he could in a normal wheelchair.
p117
aVNow, there's three important points that I want to stress
p118
aVthat I think really hit home in this project.
p119
aVThe first is that this product works well because
p120
aVwe were effectively able to combine
p121
aVrigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design
p122
aVfocused on the social and usage and economic factors
p123
aVimportant to wheelchair users in the developing countries.
p124
aVSo I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer,
p125
aVso I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on,
p126
aVand figure out how much resistance it should impose,
p127
aVlook at the parts we have available and mix and match them
p128
aVto figure out what sort of gear trains we can use,
p129
aVand then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body
p130
aVto analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair
p131
aVas you put your arms up and down the levers.
p132
aVSo as a wet-behind-the-ears student, excited,
p133
aVour team made a prototype,
p134
aVbrought that prototype to Tanzania, Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,
p135
aVand found it was terrible
p136
aVbecause we didn't get enough input from users.
p137
aVSo because we tested it with wheelchair users,
p138
aVwith wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them,
p139
aVnot just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions,
p140
aVand worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design,
p141
aVwhich we brought back to East Africa in '09
p142
aVthat worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain,
p143
aVbut it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big,
p144
aVit was heavy, it was hard to move around,
p145
aVso again with that user feedback, we went back to the drawing board,
p146
aVcame up with a better design, 20 pounds lighter,
p147
aVas narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested that in a field trial in Guatemala,
p148
aVand that advanced the product to the point
p149
aVwhere we have now that it's going into production.
p150
aVNow also being engineering scientists,
p151
aVwe were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,
p152
aVso here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala
p153
aVwhere we tested the LFC on village terrain,
p154
aVand tested people's biomechanical outputs,
p155
aVtheir oxygen consumption, how fast they go,
p156
aVhow much power they're putting out,
p157
aVboth in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC,
p158
aVand we found that the LFC is about 80 percent faster
p159
aVgoing on these terrains than a normal wheelchair.
p160
aVIt's also about 40 percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair,
p161
aVand because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers,
p162
aVyou can produce 50 percent higher torque
p163
aVand really muscle your way through the really, really rough terrain.
p164
aVNow the second lesson that we learned in this is that
p165
aVthe constraints on this design really push the innovation,
p166
aVbecause we had to hit such a low price point,
p167
aVbecause we had to make a device that could travel
p168
aVon many, many types of terrain but still be usable indoors,
p169
aVand be simple enough to repair,
p170
aVwe ended up with a fundamentally new product,
p171
aVa new product that is an innovation
p172
aVin a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years.
p173
aVAnd these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world.
p174
aVWhy not in countries like the U.S. too?
p175
aVSo we teamed up with Continuum,
p176
aVa local product design firm here in Boston
p177
aVto make the high-end version, the developed world version,
p178
aVthat we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe,
p179
aVbut to higher-income buyers.
p180
aVAnd the final point I want to make is that I think
p181
aVthis project worked well because we engaged
p182
aVall the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider
p183
aVin bringing the technology from inception of an idea
p184
aVthrough innovation, validation, commercialization and dissemination,
p185
aVand that cycle has to start and end with end users.
p186
aVThese are the people that define the requirements of the technology,
p187
aVand these are the people that have to give the thumbs-up at the end,
p188
aVand say, "Yeah, it actually works. It meets our needs."
p189
aVSo people like me in the academic space,
p190
aVwe can do things like innovate and analyze and test,
p191
aVcreate data and make bench-level prototypes,
p192
aVbut how do you get that bench-level prototype to commercialization?
p193
aVSo we need gap-fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing,
p194
aVand we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market \u2014
p195
aVGlobal Research Innovation Technology \u2014
p196
aVand then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,
p197
aVthat's tooled up now to make 500 chairs a month
p198
aVand will make the first batch of 200 next month,
p199
aVwhich will be delivered in India.
p200
aVAnd then finally, to get this out to the people in scale,
p201
aVwe teamed up with the largest disability organization
p202
aVin the world, Jaipur Foot.
p203
aVNow what's powerful about this model
p204
aVis when you bring together all these stakeholders
p205
aVthat represent each link in the chain
p206
aVfrom inception of an idea
p207
aVall the way to implementation in the field,
p208
aVthat's where the magic happens.
p209
aVThat's where you can take a guy like me, an academic,
p210
aVbut analyze and test and create a new technology
p211
aVand quantitatively determine how much better the performance is.
p212
aVYou can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers
p213
aVand talk with them face-to-face and leverage their
p214
aVlocal knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients
p215
aVand combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge
p216
aVto create something greater than either of us could have done alone.
p217
aVAnd then you can also engage the end user
p218
aVin the design process, and not just ask him what he needs,
p219
aVbut ask him how he thinks it can be achieved.
p220
aVAnd this picture was taken in India in our last field trial,
p221
aVwhere we had a 90-percent adoption rate where people
p222
aVswitched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair,
p223
aVand this picture specifically is of Ashok,
p224
aVand Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree,
p225
aVand he had been working at a tailor, but once he was injured
p226
aVhe wasn't able to transport himself from his house
p227
aVover a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair.
p228
aVThe road was too rough.
p229
aVBut the day after he got an LFC, he hopped in it,
p230
aVrode that kilometer, opened up his shop
p231
aVand soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms
p232
aVand started making money, started providing for his family again.
p233
aVAshok: You also encouraged me to work.
p234
aVI rested for a day at home.
p235
aVThe next day I went to my shop.
p236
aVNow everything is back to normal.
p237
aVAmos Winter: And thank you very much for having me today.
