VI thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,
p4
aVand showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
p5
aVAnd so, I have my first slide to talk about
p6
aVthe dawning of the universe and what I call
p7
aVthe cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at
p8
aVthe relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,
p9
aVand then following it up and trying to understand it.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd so one of the questions that I asked you is,
p12
aVwhen you look around, what do you see?
p13
aVWell, you see this space that's created by designers
p14
aVand by the work of people, but what you actually see
p15
aVis a lot of material that was already here,
p16
aVbeing reshaped in a certain form.
p17
aVAnd so the question is: how did that material get here?
p18
aVHow did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
p19
aVIt's a question of what's the continuity?
p20
aVSo one of the things I look at is,
p21
aVhow did the universe begin and shape?
p22
aVWhat was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe
p23
aVto getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
p24
aa(lp25
VSo that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you
p26
aVthe Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
p27
aVIf you look at this picture,
p28
aVwhat you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
p29
aVAnd everything but \u2014 four of these light objects are stars,
p30
aVand you can see them there \u2014 little pluses.
p31
aVThis is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
p32
aVSo there's a couple of thousand galaxies
p33
aVyou can see easily with your eye in here.
p34
aVAnd when I look out at particularly this galaxy,
p35
aVwhich looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's
p36
aVan art design college conference going on,
p37
aVand intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,
p38
aVwhat designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists
p39
aVtrying to understand where the universe itself came from,
p40
aVand there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours
p41
aVtrying to figure out what's going on over here.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,
p44
aVand they're kind of the color of the Sun,
p45
aVand some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.
p46
aVBut one of the questions is \u2014 this should be, to you \u2014
p47
aVhow come there are so many galaxies?
p48
aVBecause this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.
p49
aVThis is only 1,000 galaxies.
p50
aVWe think there's on the order \u2014 visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,
p51
aVif you had the time to scan it around \u2014
p52
aVabout 100 billion galaxies. Right?
p53
aVIt's a very large number of galaxies.
p54
aVAnd that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see
p57
aVmore galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
p58
aVSo the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,
p59
aVwhat kind of creative process and what kind of design
p60
aVproduced the world like that?
p61
aVAnd then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
p62
aVWe're going to try and follow it up.
p63
aVWe have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,
p64
aVand that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
p65
aVthat it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
p66
aVWe draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
p67
aVPut the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,
p68
aVjust because that's where we're making observations.
p69
aVAnd the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon
p70
aVusing ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.
p71
aVTwo seconds is like the present.
p72
aVThe Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,
p73
aVunless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
p74
aVYou'd like to have a little advance warning.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.
p77
aVYou hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars
p78
aVbecause it takes light long enough to go there.
p79
aVBut if you look out to the nearest set of stars,
p80
aVto the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.
p81
aVSo if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.
p82
aVBut you go and look to the center of the galaxy,
p83
aVit's thousands of years ago.
p84
aVIf you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,
p85
aVand it's two million years ago.
p86
aVIf you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,
p87
aVthere'd be no evidence of humans at all,
p88
aVbecause we don't think there were humans yet.
p89
aVI mean, it just gives you the scale.
p90
aVWith the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at
p91
aVhundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further \u2014
p94
aVthere's some things even further,
p95
aVand that was what I did in a lot of my work,
p96
aVwas to develop the techniques \u2014 we could look out back to even earlier
p97
aVepochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,
p98
aVback to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.
p99
aVAnd so that's the sort of sequence,
p100
aVand so I have a more artistic impression of this.
p101
aVThere's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,
p102
aVand around that are the Hubble \u2014 you know, nearby kind of galaxies,
p103
aVand there's a sphere that marks the different times.
p104
aVAnd behind that are some more modern galaxies.
p105
aa(lp106
VYou see the whole big picture?
p107
aVThe beginning of time is funny \u2014 it's on the outside, right?
p108
aVAnd then there's a part of the universe we can't see
p109
aVbecause it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.
p110
aVIt's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;
p111
aVyou have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
p112
aVBut you can see the edge of the Sun,
p113
aVand the universe gets that way, and you can see that.
p114
aVAnd then you see this sort of model area around the outside,
p115
aVand that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,
p116
aVwhich is actually incredibly uniform.
p117
aVThe universe is almost a perfect sphere,
p118
aVbut there are these very tiny variations
p119
aVwhich we show here in great exaggeration.
p120
aVAnd from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go
p121
aVfrom these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars
p122
aVto these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo it's a big design job,
p125
aVbut we'll see about how things are going on.
p126
aVSo the way these measurements were done,
p127
aVthere's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.
p128
aVSo there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,
p129
aVand we discovered these variations.
p130
aVAnd then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched \u2014 the WMAP \u2014
p131
aVand it made somewhat better pictures.
p132
aVAnd later this year \u2014 this is the cool stealth version,
p133
aVthe one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,
p134
aVand you should look \u2014 the Planck satellite will be launched,
p135
aVand it will make very high-resolution maps.
p136
aVAnd that will be the sequence of understanding
p137
aVthe very beginning of the universe.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us
p140
aVthe secrets, both about the structure of space-time,
p141
aVand about the contents of the universe,
p142
aVand about how the universe started in its original motions.
p143
aVSo we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,
p144
aVand I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have
p145
aVsome mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
p146
aVAnd we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe
p147
aVexpands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,
p148
aVthen to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,
p149
aVand they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
p150
aVAnd somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
p151
aVAnd it's maturing up to the present time.
p152
aVAnd there's some spectacular things.
p153
aVAnd this wastebasket part, that's to represent
p154
aVwhat the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.
p155
aVAnd so this is a pretty weird model, right?
p156
aVWhat kind of evidence do we have for that?
p157
aa(lp158
VSo let me show you some of nature's patterns
p159
aVthat are the result of this.
p160
aVI always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,
p161
aVand the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
p162
aVIt's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
p163
aVSo here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
p164
aVSo there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
p165
aVThey go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,
p166
aVidentify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,
p167
aVestimate how far away they are, and plot them up.
p168
aVAnd just put radially they're going out that way.
p169
aVAnd you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,
p170
aVbut there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out
p171
aVbecause the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow I'm going to show you this in 3D.
p174
aVWhat happens is, you take pictures
p175
aVas the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.
p176
aVThere are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,
p177
aVor because there are no telescopes available to do it.
p178
aVSo the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
p179
aVDo you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
p180
aVRemember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,
p181
aVyou know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.
p182
aVAnd you see this thing we call the Great Wall,
p183
aVand you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.
p184
aVThere are places where there are no galaxies and there are places
p185
aVwhere there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.
p186
aVSo there's an interesting pattern,
p187
aVbut we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
p188
aVWe only have a million galaxies, right?
p189
aVSo we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air
p190
aVbut, what's going on?
p191
aVThere's another survey which is very similar to this,
p192
aVcalled the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow we're going to fly through it at warp a million.
p195
aVAnd every time there's a galaxy \u2014 at its location there's a galaxy \u2014
p196
aVand if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,
p197
aVbecause there's a redshift measurement and everything,
p198
aVyou put in the type of galaxy and the color,
p199
aVso this is the real representation.
p200
aVAnd when you're in the middle of the galaxies
p201
aVit's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
p202
aVIt's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,
p203
aVit's hard to see the pattern of this.
p204
aVSo we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.
p205
aVAnd you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,
p206
aVand then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies
p207
aVthat we see out there.
p208
aVSo again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut you can see the voids,
p211
aVyou can see the complicated structure, and you say,
p212
aVwell, how did this happen?
p213
aVSuppose you're the cosmic designer.
p214
aVHow are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?
p215
aVIt's not just throwing them out at random.
p216
aVThere's a more complicated process going on here.
p217
aVHow are you going to end up doing that?
p218
aVAnd so now we're in for some serious play.
p219
aVThat is, we have to seriously play God,
p220
aVnot just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
p221
aVSo if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?
p222
aVWhat's the kind of technique?
p223
aVWhat's the kind of thing you're going to do?
p224
aa(lp225
VSo I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation
p226
aVof what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,
p227
aVsome of the play principles and some of the design principles that,
p228
aVyou know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,
p229
aVbut apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.
p230
aVAnd that is, you start out with very simple ingredients
p231
aVand some simple rules,
p232
aVbut you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.
p233
aVAnd then you put in some randomness,
p234
aVsome fluctuations and some randomness,
p235
aVand realize a whole bunch of different representations.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo what I'm going to do is show you
p238
aVthe distribution of matter as a function of scales.
p239
aVWe're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
p240
aVAnd we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
p241
aVIt's called dark matter.
p242
aVThat is matter that doesn't interact with light
p243
aVthe typical way that ordinary matter does,
p244
aVthe way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
p245
aVIt's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,
p246
aVwe're going to make it white. OK?
p247
aVSo the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
p248
aVIt should be called invisible matter,
p249
aVbut the dark matter we've made visible.
p250
aVAnd the stuff that is in the yellow color,
p251
aVthat is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo I'll show you the next movie.
p254
aVSo this \u2014 we're going to zoom in.
p255
aVNotice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.
p256
aVWe're going to zoom in and zoom in.
p257
aVAnd you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.
p258
aVAnd when a number of filaments come together in a knot,
p259
aVthat makes a supercluster of galaxies.
p260
aVThis one we're zooming in on
p261
aVis somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
p262
aVSo we live in the boonies.
p263
aVWe don't live in the center of the solar system,
p264
aVwe don't live in the center of the galaxy
p265
aVand our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo we're zooming in.
p268
aVThis is a region which probably has more than 100,000,
p269
aVon the order of a million galaxies in that region.
p270
aVWe're going to keep zooming in. OK.
p271
aVAnd so I forgot to tell you the scale.
p272
aVA parsec is 3.26 light years.
p273
aVSo a gigaparsec is three billion light years \u2014 that's the scale.
p274
aVSo it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
p275
aVNow we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
p276
aVThat's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?
p277
aVThese little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow we're going to zoom back out,
p280
aVand you can see this structure that,
p281
aVwhen we get very far out, looks very regular,
p282
aVbut it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
p283
aVSo they're simple building blocks.
p284
aVThere's a very simple fluid to begin with.
p285
aVIt's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,
p286
aVit's got photons and it's got neutrinos,
p287
aVwhich don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
p288
aVAnd it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,
p289
aVdevelops into this complicated structure.
p290
aVAnd so you know when you first saw this picture,
p291
aVit didn't mean quite so much to you.
p292
aVHere you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe
p293
aVand you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,
p294
aVbut you realize they're not even the main structure.
p295
aVThere's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,
p296
aVthat's out there that's actually holding it all together.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is
p299
aVwhen you're in the middle of something to figure this out.
p300
aVSo here's that same end result.
p301
aVYou see a filament,
p302
aVyou see the light is the invisible matter,
p303
aVand the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
p304
aVAnd we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,
p305
aVand you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,
p306
aVand you get a large cluster of galaxies.
p307
aVAnd then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,
p308
aVand you can see what it looks like.
p309
aVAnd so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
p310
aVIt's only when you look at it at a very large scale,
p311
aVand explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,
p312
aVcomplicated kind of a design, right?
p313
aVAnd it's grown up in some kind of way.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo the question is,
p316
aVhow hard would it be to assemble this, right?
p317
aVHow big a contractor team would you need
p318
aVto put this universe together, right?
p319
aVThat's the issue, right?
p320
aVAnd so here we are.
p321
aVYou see how the filament \u2014
p322
aVyou see how several filaments are coming together,
p323
aVtherefore making this supercluster of galaxies.
p324
aVAnd you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look
p325
aVif you \u2014 first, you can't travel this fast,
p326
aVeverything would be distorted,
p327
aVbut this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.
p328
aVThis is how, if you took billions of years to go around,
p329
aVit might look to you, right?
p330
aVAnd if you could see invisible matter, too.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe
p333
aVin a very simple way?
p334
aVWe're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,
p335
aVeverything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope
p336
aVplus our other instruments,
p337
aVwas once in a region that was smaller than an atom.
p338
aVIt started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,
p339
aVbut expanding at a tremendous rate.
p340
aVAnd those fluctuations
p341
aVwere stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations
p342
aVeventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.
p343
aVAnd then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies
p344
aVand clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
p347
aVThis simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month
p348
aVin order to make just this simple visible one.
p349
aVSo I'm going to show you one
p350
aVthat can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.
p351
aVSo you start out with teeny fluctuations
p352
aVwhen the universe was at this point,
p353
aVnow four times smaller, and so forth.
p354
aVAnd you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
p355
aVAnd this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter
p356
aVand it just has the dark matter in it.
p357
aVAnd you see how the dark matter lumps up,
p358
aVand the ordinary matter just trails along behind.
p359
aVSo there it is.
p360
aVAt the beginning it's very uniform.
p361
aVThe fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
p362
aVThere are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,
p363
aVand then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.
p364
aa(lp365
VThis is light over density, pulls the material around in.
p366
aVThat pulls in more material and pulls in more material.
p367
aVBut the distances on the universe are so large
p368
aVand the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
p369
aVAnd it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,
p370
aVin terms of its expansion.
p371
aVAnd at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating
p372
aVits expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.
p373
aVSo we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,
p374
aVand then only things that have started forming already
p375
aVare going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.
p378
aVWe need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors
p379
aVto do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
p380
aVSo we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe
p381
aVby starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,
p382
aVand we create everything we can see in any direction, right,
p383
aVfrom almost nothing \u2014 that is, something extremely tiny,
p384
aVextremely small \u2014 and it is almost perfect,
p385
aVexcept it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,
p386
aVwhich turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,
p387
aVthat is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it
p390
aVto make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
p391
aVAnd that design is sort of way beyond
p392
aVwhat our original imagination ever was.
p393
aVSo this is what we started with 15 years ago,
p394
aVwith the Cosmic Background Explorer \u2014 made the map on the upper right,
p395
aVwhich basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,
p396
aVand actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.
p397
aVSince then we've had WMAP,
p398
aVwhich just gives us higher angular resolution.
p399
aVWe see the same large-scale structure,
p400
aVbut we see additional small-scale structure.
p401
aVAnd on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down
p402
aVand mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.
p403
aVYou can see, well, you can, kind of pick out
p404
aVall the major continents, but that's about it.
p405
aa(lp406
VBut what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution
p407
aVabout equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,
p408
aVwhere you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.
p409
aVAnd you can also tell, because of the sharp edges
p410
aVand the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.
p411
aVGeology has these effects,
p412
aVwhich is moving the plates around and so forth.
p413
aVYou can see that just from the map alone.
p414
aVWe want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe
p415
aVwe can see whether there are any non-linear effects
p416
aVthat are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how
p417
aVspace-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.
p418
aVSo that's where we are today,
p419
aVand that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of.
p420
aVGive you a different view about what the design
p421
aVand what everything else looks like.
p422
aVThank you.
