VHow will we be remembered in 200 years?
p4
aVI happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,
p5
aVwhich every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:
p6
aVthe Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.
p7
aVIt was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,
p8
aVand was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.
p9
aVIt happened 225 years ago.
p10
aVIt was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.
p11
aVThe town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,
p12
aVand it was a very, very severe winter.
p13
aVAnd about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter
p14
aVfrom hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.
p15
aVWhat they remember is, of course, the great triumph,
p16
aVthat the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.
p17
aVAnd so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.
p18
aVIt's the child that's remembered.
p19
aVAnd that's what we're going through at this time.
p20
aa(lp21
VI wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,
p22
aVbecause I think I know very little about that \u2014 I'm not a biologist \u2014
p23
aVso everything I know about it can be said in one minute.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVWhat I'm saying is that we should follow the model
p26
aVthat has been so successful with the electronic industry,
p27
aVthat what really turned computers into a great success, in the world
p28
aVas a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,
p29
aVwhen kids could come home and play with them,
p30
aVthen the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.
p31
aa(lp32
VThere's a huge \u2014
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aV(Applause)
p35
aV\u2014 there's a huge community of people in the world
p36
aVwho are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,
p37
aVpigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,
p38
aVpeople who handle biology with their hands,
p39
aVand who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,
p40
aVplants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,
p41
aVand that will be an enormous positive step
p42
aVto acceptance of biotechnology.
p43
aVThat will blow away a lot of the opposition.
p44
aVWhen people have this technology in their hands,
p45
aVyou have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own \u2014
p46
aVgrow your dog, grow your own cat.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aVJust buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,
p50
aVyou can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and
p51
aVI think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,
p52
aVbecomes part of the human condition,
p53
aVsomething that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo, let's leave that aside.
p56
aVI want to talk about something quite different,
p57
aVwhich is what I know about, and that is astronomy.
p58
aVAnd I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.
p59
aVAnd it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,
p60
aVand that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,
p61
aVor whatever the time remains.
p62
aVThe important fact is, that most of the real estate
p63
aVthat's accessible to us \u2014 I'm not talking about the stars,
p64
aVI'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach
p65
aVfor spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes \u2014
p66
aVmost of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.
p67
aa(lp68
VIf you look at the solar system, as we know it today,
p69
aVit has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.
p70
aVIt has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between
p71
aVthe orbit of the Earth out through \u2014 to the orbit of Jupiter.
p72
aVThe asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,
p73
aVbut not very large. And it's not very promising for life,
p74
aVsince most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.
p75
aVIt's not only cold, but very dry.
p76
aVSo the asteroids we don't have much hope for.
p77
aa(lp78
VThere stand some interesting places a little further out:
p79
aVthe moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
p80
aVParticularly, there's a place called Europa, which is \u2014
p81
aVEuropa is one of the moons of Jupiter,
p82
aVwhere we see a very level ice surface,
p83
aVwhich looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.
p84
aVSo, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.
p85
aVAnd that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
p86
aVOcean \u2014 probably the most likely place for life to originate,
p87
aVjust as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,
p88
aVto go down through the ice,
p89
aVfind out who is swimming around in the ocean,
p90
aVwhether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters \u2014
p91
aVwhatever there may be that's exciting \u2014- or cephalopods.
p92
aVBut that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.
p93
aVWe don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,
p94
aVso it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there \u2014
p95
aVsend down your submarine or whatever it is \u2014 and explore.
p96
aVThat's something we don't yet know how to do.
p97
aVThere are plans to do it, but it's hard.
p98
aa(lp99
VGo out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,
p100
aVway out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.
p101
aVYou'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,
p102
aVin what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud \u2014
p103
aVthese are clouds of small objects which appear as comets
p104
aVwhen they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there
p105
aVin the cold of the outer solar system,
p106
aVbut they are biologically very interesting indeed,
p107
aVbecause they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,
p108
aVwhich are just the right ones for developing life.
p109
aVSo if life could be established out there,
p110
aVit would have all the essentials \u2014 chemistry and sunlight \u2014
p111
aVeverything that's needed.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, what I'm proposing
p114
aVis that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,
p115
aValthough Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.
p116
aVBut we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.
p117
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk about.
p118
aVThere is a \u2014 imagine that life originated on Europa,
p119
aVand it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
p120
aVIt's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,
p121
aVjust as it did on the Earth.
p122
aVStaying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,
p123
aVfinally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great \u2014
p124
aVmuch greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures
p125
aVdeveloped on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
p126
aVAnd the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,
p129
aVit could also have moved out onto the surface.
p130
aVThere wouldn't have been any air there \u2014 it's a vacuum.
p131
aVIt is out in the cold, but it still could have come.
p132
aVYou can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp
p133
aVthrough cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.
p134
aVWhat would they need in order to grow on the surface?
p135
aVThey'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves
p136
aVfrom losing water through the skin.
p137
aVSo they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.
p138
aVBut better \u2014 what is more important
p139
aVis that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
p140
aVThe sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,
p141
aVis 25 times fainter than it is here,
p142
aVsince Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.
p143
aVSo they would have to have \u2014 these creatures, which I call sunflowers,
p144
aVwhich I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have
p145
aVeither lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
p146
aVso they could keep themselves warm on the surface.
p147
aVOtherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,
p148
aVwhich is certainly not favorable for developing life,
p149
aVat least of the kind we know.
p150
aVBut if they just simply could grow, like leaves,
p151
aVlittle lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
p152
aVthen they could keep warm on the surface.
p153
aVThey could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight
p154
aVand have roots going down into the ocean;
p155
aVlife then could flourish much more.
p156
aVSo, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely
p157
aVthat there's life on the surface of Europa.
p158
aVNone of these things is likely, but my,
p159
aVmy philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.
p160
aa(lp161
VThere's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things
p162
aVturning out to be there. And I mean,
p163
aVthe finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.
p164
aVThis was \u2014 originally, when radio astronomy began,
p165
aVMr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.
p166
aVAnd the regular astronomers were scornful about this.
p167
aVThey said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,
p168
aVbut the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough
p169
aVand bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate
p170
aVthat radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,
p171
aVand everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,
p172
aVso it certainly will not be detectable.
p173
aVSo there's no point in looking."
p174
aVAnd that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy
p175
aVby about 20 years.
p176
aVSince there was nothing there, you might as well not look.
p177
aVWell, of course, as soon as anybody did look,
p178
aVwhich was after about 20 years,
p179
aVwhen radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out
p180
aVthe universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things
p181
aVradiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.
p182
aVSo, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,
p183
aVwhich I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact
p184
aVbe very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected
p185
aVjust because we haven't taken the trouble to look.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.
p188
aVThere is something called pit lamping.
p189
aVThat's the phrase which I learned from my son George,
p190
aVwho is there in the audience.
p191
aVYou take \u2014 that's a Canadian expression.
p192
aVIf you happen to want to hunt animals at night,
p193
aVyou take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.
p194
aVYou strap it onto your forehead, so you can see
p195
aVthe reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,
p196
aVyou shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.
p197
aVYou see the red glow in their eyes,
p198
aVwhich is the reflection of the flashlight.
p199
aVAnd then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,
p200
aVyou shoot the animals and take them home.
p201
aVAnd of course, that spoils the game
p202
aVfor the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,
p203
aVso in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,
p204
aVbecause the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,
p205
aVbecause the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.
p206
aVSo, the farmers go out at night
p207
aVwith heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,
p208
aVand anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo I have proposed to apply the same trick
p212
aVto looking for life in the universe.
p213
aVThat if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces \u2014
p214
aVeither on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live
p215
aVon a cold surface \u2014 those creatures must be provided with reflectors.
p216
aVIn order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors \u2014
p217
aVin order to keep themselves warm.
p218
aVAnd then, when you shine sunlight at them,
p219
aVthe sunlight will be reflected back,
p220
aVjust as it is in the eyes of an animal.
p221
aVSo these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.
p222
aVAnd the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,
p223
aVthe more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,
p224
aVthis method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger
p225
aVas you go further away,
p226
aVbecause the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light
p227
aVshines out even more in contrast against the dark background.
p228
aVSo as you go further away from the Sun,
p229
aVthis becomes more and more powerful.
p230
aVSo, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.
p231
aVWhy aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut I hope that we shall look, and with any \u2014
p234
aVwe probably won't find anything,
p235
aVnone of these speculations may have any basis in fact.
p236
aVBut still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,
p237
aVit will transform our view of life altogether.
p238
aVBecause it means that \u2014 the way life can live out there,
p239
aVit has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
p240
aVIt's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.
p241
aVWe're having great difficulties at the moment
p242
aVand any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.
p243
aVEspecially if you breathe air,
p244
aVit's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,
p245
aVbecause there's no air in between. But if you breathe air \u2014
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aV\u2014 you're dead \u2014
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aV\u2014 as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface
p252
aVof one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,
p253
aVthis \u2014 an object like Pluto, or one of the
p254
aVsmaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,
p255
aVand you happened \u2014 if you're living on the surface there,
p256
aVand you get knocked off the surface by a collision,
p257
aVthen it doesn't change anything all that much.
p258
aVYou still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight
p259
aVand you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.
p260
aVAnd then if you run into another object, you can stay there
p261
aVand colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,
p262
aVfrom one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,
p263
aVit's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then
p264
aVa great competition amongst species \u2014 Darwinian evolution \u2014
p265
aVso there'll be a huge advantage to the species
p266
aVwhich is able to jump from one place to another
p267
aVwithout having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages
p268
aVfor spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.
p269
aVI call these creatures sunflowers.
p270
aVThey look like, maybe like sunflowers.
p271
aVThey have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,
p272
aVand they will be able to spread out in space,
p273
aVbecause gravity on these objects is weak.
p274
aVSo they can collect sunlight from a big area.
p275
aVSo they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,
p278
aVand then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.
p279
aVIf we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aVThat's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.
p282
aVWe can \u2014 as soon as we have a little bit more understanding
p283
aVof genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your
p284
aVtake-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit \u2014
p285
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p286
aVis to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,
p287
aVa place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.
p288
aVThat would be a fun thing to do.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVIn the long run, of course,
p291
aVit would also make it possible for us to move out there.
p292
aVWhat's going to happen in the end,
p293
aVit's not going to be just humans colonizing space,
p294
aVit's going to be life moving out from the Earth,
p295
aVmoving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,
p296
aVof course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,
p297
aVit makes it much more exciting, in the short run.
p298
aVBut in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
p299
aVWe transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful
p300
aVthan it is today.
p301
aVSo again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.
p302
aVThank you.
