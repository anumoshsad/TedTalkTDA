VWhat I do is I organize information.
p4
aVI'm a graphic designer.
p5
aVProfessionally, I try to make sense
p6
aVoften of things that don't make much sense themselves.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living.
p9
aVHis part of my ancestry has been farmers.
p10
aVHe's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks.
p11
aVThey lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide
p12
aVabout a hundred years ago.
p13
aVAnd ever since that, migration has somewhat been a theme in my family.
p14
aVMy father moved to Germany, studied there and married,
p15
aVand as a result, I now have this half-German brain,
p16
aVwith all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor
p17
aVthat come with that.
p18
aVAnd of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries,
p19
aVand that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well,
p20
aVin good family tradition, if you like.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut of course, most journeys that we undertake from day to day
p23
aVare within a city.
p24
aVAnd, especially if you know the city,
p25
aVgetting from A to B may seem pretty obvious, right?
p26
aVBut the question is, why is it obvious?
p27
aVHow do we know where we're going?
p28
aa(lp29
VSo I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about 12 years ago,
p30
aVa professional foreigner, if you like,
p31
aVand I'm sure you've all had this experience before, yeah?
p32
aVYou arrive in a new city,
p33
aVand your brain is trying to make sense of this new place.
p34
aVOnce you find your base, your home,
p35
aVyou start to build this cognitive map of your environment.
p36
aVIt's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain.
p37
aVAll animal species do it,
p38
aVeven though we all use slightly different tools.
p39
aVUs humans, of course, we don't move around marking our territory by scent, like dogs.
p40
aVWe don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.
p41
aVWe just don't do that,
p42
aValthough a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VNo, we do two important things to make a place our own.
p47
aVFirst, we move along linear routes.
p48
aVTypically, we find a main street,
p49
aVand this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds.
p50
aVBut our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?
p51
aVEvery street is generally perceived as a straight line,
p52
aVand we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make.
p53
aVWhen we do, however, make a turn into a side street,
p54
aVour mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90-degree angle.
p55
aVThis of course makes for some funny moments
p56
aVwhen you're in some old city layout
p57
aVthat follows some sort of circular city logic, yeah?
p58
aVMaybe you've had that experience as well.
p59
aa(lp60
VLet's say you're on some spot on a side street
p61
aVthat projects from a main cathedral square,
p62
aVand you want to get to another point on a side street just like that.
p63
aVThe cognitive map in your mind may tell you,
p64
aV"Aris, go back to the main cathedral square,
p65
aVtake a 90-degree turn and walk down that other side street."
p66
aVBut somehow you feel adventurous that day, and you suddenly discover
p67
aVthat the two spots were actually only a single building apart.
p68
aVNow, I don't know about you,
p69
aVbut I always feel like I find this wormhole
p70
aVor this inter-dimensional portal.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo we move along linear routes
p75
aVand our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe second thing that we do to make a place our own
p78
aVis we attach meaning and emotions to the things
p79
aVthat we see along those lines.
p80
aVIf you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions,
p81
aVbrace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling
p82
aVabout all the landmarks, yeah?
p83
aVShe'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work,
p84
aVand "... go past that church where I got married," that kind of thing.
p85
aVSo we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning.
p86
aVWhat's more, we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them.
p87
aVWe recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols.
p88
aVAnd of course, we're all capable of understanding these symbols.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat's more, we're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps,
p93
aVand you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves.
p94
aVSo next time, when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place,
p95
aVyou grab a beermat, grab a napkin, and you just observe yourself
p96
aVcreate this awesome piece of communication design.
p97
aVIt's got straight lines.
p98
aVIt's got 90-degree corners.
p99
aVYou might add little symbols along the way.
p100
aVAnd when you look at what you've just drawn,
p101
aVyou realize it does not resemble a street map.
p102
aVIf you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn,
p103
aVyou'd realize your streets and the distances \u2014 they'd be way off.
p104
aVNo, what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic.
p105
aVIt's a visual construct of lines, dots, letters,
p106
aVdesigned in the language of our brains.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo it's no big surprise
p109
aVthat the big information-design icon of the last century \u2014
p110
aVthe pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B,
p111
aVthe London Underground map \u2014
p112
aVwas not designed by a cartographer or a city planner;
p113
aVit was designed by an engineering draftsman.
p114
aVIn the 1930s,
p115
aVHarry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design
p116
aVand changed the way public transport maps are designed forever.
p117
aVNow the very key to the success of this map
p118
aVis in the omission of less important information
p119
aVand in the extreme simplification.
p120
aVSo, straightened streets, corners of 90 and 45 degrees,
p121
aVbut also the extreme geographic distortion in that map.
p122
aVIf you were to look at the actual locations of these stations,
p123
aVyou'd see they're very different.
p124
aVBut this is all for the clarity of the public Tube map.
p125
aVIf you, say, wanted to get from Regent's Park station
p126
aVto Great Portland Street,
p127
aVthe Tube map would tell you:
p128
aVtake the Tube, go to Baker Street, change over, take another Tube.
p129
aVOf course, what you don't know is that the two stations
p130
aVare only about a hundred meters apart.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow we've reached the subject of public transport,
p133
aVand public transport here in Dublin
p134
aVis a somewhat touchy subject.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VFor everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin,
p139
aVessentially, we have this system of local buses that grew with the city.
p140
aVFor every outskirt that was added, there was another bus route added,
p141
aVrunning from the outskirt all the way to the city center.
p142
aVAnd as these local buses approach the city center,
p143
aVthey all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago,
p146
aVI tried to make sense of that.
p147
aVBecause exploring a city on foot only gets you so far.
p148
aVBut when you explore a foreign and new public transport system,
p149
aVyou will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way.
p150
aVTypically, you choose yourself a rapid transport route,
p151
aVand in your mind, this route is perceived as a straight line.
p152
aVAnd like a pearl necklace,
p153
aVall the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line.
p154
aVAnd only then you start to discover some local bus routes
p155
aVthat would fill in the gaps,
p156
aVand that allow for those wormhole, inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.
p157
aVSo I tried to make sense, and when I arrived,
p158
aVI was looking for some information leaflets
p159
aVthat would help me crack this system and understand it,
p160
aVand I found those brochures.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VThey were not geographically distorted.
p165
aVThey had a lot of omission of information,
p166
aVbut unfortunately, the wrong information.
p167
aVSay, in the city center \u2014
p168
aVthere were never actually any lines that showed the routes.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VThere are actually not even any stations with names.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, the maps of Dublin transport have gotten better,
p177
aVand after I finished the project, they got a good bit better,
p178
aVbut still no station names, still no routes.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, being naive, and being half-German, I decided,
p181
aV"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"
p182
aVSo that's what I did.
p183
aVI researched how each and every bus route moved through the city, nice and logical,
p184
aVevery bus route a separate line.
p185
aVI plotted it into my own map of Dublin,
p186
aVand in the city center ...
p187
aVI got a nice spaghetti plate.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, this is a bit of a mess,
p192
aVso I decided, of course,
p193
aV"You're going to apply the rules of schematic design,"
p194
aVcleaning up the corridors,
p195
aVwidening the streets where there were loads of buses
p196
aVand making the streets at straight, 90-degree corners, 45-degree corners
p197
aVor fractions of that,
p198
aVand filled it in with the bus routes.
p199
aVAnd I built this city center bus map of the system,
p200
aVhow it was five years ago.
p201
aVI'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact
p202
aVof the quays and Westmoreland Street.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VNow I can proudly say \u2014
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VI can proudly say, as a public transport map,
p211
aVthis diagram is an utter failure.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aVExcept, probably, in one aspect:
p215
aVI now had a great visual representation
p216
aVof just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, call me old-fashioned,
p219
aVbut I think a public transport route map should have lines,
p220
aVbecause that's what they are, yeah?
p221
aVThey're little pieces of string that wrap their way
p222
aVthrough the city center or through the city.
p223
aVIf you will, the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line,
p224
aVit's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur
p225
aVwithout having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way.
p226
aVSo the outcome of my academic research,
p227
aVloads of questionnaires, case studies and looking at a lot of maps,
p228
aVwas that a lot of the problems and shortcomings
p229
aVof the public transport system here in Dublin
p230
aVwas the lack of a coherent public transport map \u2014
p231
aVa simplified, coherent public transport map \u2014
p232
aVbecause I think this is the crucial step to understanding
p233
aVa public transport network on a physical level,
p234
aVbut it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable
p235
aVon a visual level.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy,
p238
aVa civil engineer and a recent master's graduate
p239
aVof the Sustainable Development program at DIT,
p240
aVand together we drafted the simplified model network,
p241
aVwhich I could then go ahead and visualize.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo here's what we did.
p244
aVWe distributed these rapid-transport corridors throughout the city center,
p245
aVand extended them into the outskirts.
p246
aVRapid, because we wanted them to be served by rapid-transport vehicles.
p247
aVThey would get exclusive road use, where possible,
p248
aVand it would be high-quantity, high-quality transport.
p249
aVJames wanted to use bus rapid transport for that,
p250
aVrather than light rail.
p251
aVFor me, it was important
p252
aVthat the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors
p253
aVwould be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street.
p254
aVNow we could take out all the local buses
p255
aVthat ran alongside those rapid transport means.
p256
aVAny gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again.
p257
aVSo, in other words, if there was a street in an outskirt
p258
aVwhere there had been a bus, we put a bus back in,
p259
aVonly now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center,
p260
aVbut connect to the nearest rapid-transport mode,
p261
aVone of these thick lines over there.
p262
aVSo the rest was merely a couple of months of work,
p263
aVand a couple of fights with my girlfriend,
p264
aVof our place constantly being clogged up with maps,
p265
aVand the outcome, one of the outcomes,
p266
aVwas this map of the Greater Dublin area.
p267
aVI'll zoom in a little bit.
p268
aa(lp269
VThis map only shows the rapid transport connections, no local bus,
p270
aVvery much in the "metro map" style that was so successful in London,
p271
aVand that since has been exported to so many other major cities,
p272
aVand therefore is the language that we should use
p273
aVfor public transport maps.
p274
aVWhat's also important is, with a simplified network like this,
p275
aVit now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge
p276
aVand make a public transport map for the city center,
p277
aVone where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections,
p278
aVbut also all the local bus routes, streets and the likes,
p279
aVand this is what a map like this could look like.
p280
aVI'll zoom in a little bit.
p281
aa(lp282
VIn this map, I'm including each transport mode,
p283
aVso rapid transport, bus, DART, tram and the likes.
p284
aVEach individual route is represented by a separate line.
p285
aVThe map shows each and every station,
p286
aVeach and every station name,
p287
aVand I'm also displaying side streets.
p288
aVIn fact, most of the side streets even with their name,
p289
aVand for good measure, also a couple of landmarks,
p290
aVsome of them signified by little symbols,
p291
aVothers by these isometric three-dimensional
p292
aVbird's-eye-view drawings.
p293
aa(lp294
VThe map is relatively small in overall size,
p295
aVso something that you could still hold as a fold-out map
p296
aVor display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter.
p297
aVI think it tries to be the best balance
p298
aVbetween actual representation and simplification \u2014
p299
aVthe language of way-finding in our brain.
p300
aVSo, straightened lines, cleaned-up corners,
p301
aVand of course, that very, very important geographic distortion
p302
aVthat makes public transport maps possible.
p303
aVIf you, for example, have a look at the two main corridors
p304
aVthat run through the city \u2014 the yellow and orange one over here \u2014
p305
aVthis is how they look in an actual, accurate street map,
p306
aVand this is how they would look in my distorted,
p307
aVsimplified public transport map.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo for a successful public transport map,
p310
aVwe should not stick to accurate representation,
p311
aVbut design them in the way our brains work.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe reactions I got were tremendous, it was really good to see.
p314
aVAnd of course, for my own self, I was very happy to see
p315
aVthat my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea
p316
aVwhat I do for a living.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
