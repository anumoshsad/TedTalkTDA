p4
aVDavid Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.
p5
aVAnd we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
p6
aVWe've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,
p7
aVand we're not going to show you any of it.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VThe truth of the matter is that the Titanic \u2014
p11
aVeven though it's breaking all sorts of box office records \u2014
p12
aVit's not the most exciting story from the sea.
p13
aVAnd the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.
p14
aVWhen you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
p15
aVMost of the planet is ocean water.
p16
aVThe average depth is about two miles.
p17
aVPart of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,
p18
aVor we see images like this of the ocean,
p19
aVand you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering
p20
aVand it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,
p21
aVbut you have no idea for what lies in there.
p22
aVAnd in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.
p23
aVMost of the animals are in the oceans.
p24
aVMost of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,
p25
aVat the bottom of the sea.
p26
aVThe biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,
p27
aVthan it is in the rainforests.
p28
aVIt's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this
p29
aVthat captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think
p32
aVthat you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.
p33
aVWe have to have a very special technology
p34
aVto get into that unfamiliar world.
p35
aVWe use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,
p36
aVand the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.
p37
aVMarcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery
p38
aVis not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
p39
aVPeople that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,
p40
aVnot only on what exists \u2014
p41
aVthe new landscapes at the bottom of the sea \u2014
p42
aVbut also how we think about life on the planet itself.
p43
aa(lp44
VHere's a jelly.
p45
aVIt's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
p46
aVThis turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
p47
aVIt gets up to about 150 feet long.
p48
aVBut see all those different working things?
p49
aVI love that kind of stuff.
p50
aVIt's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
p51
aVIt's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
p52
aVIt's a colonial animal.
p53
aVThese are all individual animals
p54
aVbanding together to make this one creature.
p55
aVAnd it's got these jet thrusters up in front
p56
aVthat it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
p57
aVIf you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,
p58
aVput them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals
p59
aVon the other side, those guys win hands down.
p60
aa(lp61
VMost of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
p62
aVHere's the X-wing death jelly.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVThe bioluminescence \u2014 they use the lights for attracting mates
p65
aVand attracting prey and communicating.
p66
aVWe couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.
p67
aVThey come in all different sizes and shapes.
p68
aa(lp69
VBill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep
p70
aVon average, and that we're real familiar with the animals
p71
aVthat are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar
p72
aVwith what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
p73
aVAnd these are the types of animals
p74
aVthat live in that three-dimensional space,
p75
aVthat micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.
p76
aVYou hear about giant squid and things like that,
p77
aVbut some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
p78
aVThey're very little understood.
p79
aa(lp80
VDG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.
p81
aVYou can actually see through his head.
p82
aVAnd here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.
p83
aVWe see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
p84
aVThey go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.
p85
aVThey come right up to the submarine \u2014
p86
aVthey'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is really a world within a world,
p89
aVand we're going to show you two.
p90
aVIn this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
p91
aVThis is kind of like an undersea rooster.
p92
aVThis guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.
p93
aVAnd then one of my favorites. What a face!
p94
aVThis is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
p95
aVIt's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.
p96
aVAnd that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,
p97
aVis providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,
p98
aVin the world where they belong.
p99
aVThey don't catch them in a net.
p100
aVThey're actually looking at them down in that world.
p101
aVWe're going to take a joystick,
p102
aVsit in front of our computer, on the Earth,
p103
aVand press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,
p106
aVa 40,000-mile long mountain range.
p107
aVThe average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.
p108
aVAnd we're over the Atlantic \u2014 that's the ridge right there \u2014
p109
aVbut we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,
p110
aVand end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.
p111
aVWe make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,
p112
aVand this is one of those mountain ranges.
p113
aVWe're coming around a cliff here on the right.
p114
aVThe height of these mountains on either side of this valley
p115
aVis greater than the Alps in most cases.
p116
aVAnd there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is a volcanic ridge.
p119
aVWe're getting down further and further in scale.
p120
aVAnd eventually, we can come up with something like this.
p121
aa(lp122
VThis is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.
p123
aVAnd you can sit in a room like this,
p124
aVwith a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that
p125
aVaround the bottom of the ocean in real time.
p126
aVOne of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners
p127
aVis to bring this virtual world \u2014
p128
aVthis world, this unexplored region \u2014 back to the laboratory.
p129
aVBecause we see it in bits and pieces right now.
p130
aVWe see it either as sound, or we see it as video,
p131
aVor we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,
p132
aVbut we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
p133
aa(lp134
VHere's where Bill's cameras really do shine.
p135
aVThis is what's called a hydrothermal vent.
p136
aVAnd what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,
p137
aVhydrogen-sulfide-rich water
p138
aVcoming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
p139
aVGets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.
p140
aVSo that's all water under the sea \u2014
p141
aVa mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.
p142
aVAnd we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.
p143
aVAnd then we had some hint that these things existed
p144
aVall along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,
p145
aVwater's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,
p146
aVcome in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.
p147
aVWe weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.
p148
aVWe didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis is one of these hydrothermal vents.
p151
aVSix hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.
p152
aVOn either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,
p153
aVso the setting here is very dramatic.
p154
aa(lp155
VBL: The white material is a type of bacteria
p156
aVthat thrives at 180 degrees C.
p157
aa(lp158
VDG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now
p159
aVthat we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,
p160
aVis that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor
p161
aVafter a volcanic eruption is bacteria.
p162
aVAnd we started to wonder for a long time,
p163
aVhow did it all get down there?
p164
aVWhat we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.
p165
aVNot only is it coming out of the Earth \u2014
p166
aVso, biogenesis made from volcanic activity \u2014
p167
aVbut that bacteria supports these colonies of life.
p168
aVThe pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.
p169
aVA mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles \u2014
p170
aVno sun has ever gotten down here.
p171
aVAll the energy to support these life forms
p172
aVis coming from inside the Earth \u2014 so, chemosynthesis.
p173
aVAnd you can see how dense the population is.
p174
aVThese are called tube worms.
p175
aa(lp176
VBL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.
p177
aVBut they have two types of gill structures.
p178
aVOne for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,
p179
aVanother one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,
p180
aVwhich takes the hydrothermal fluid \u2014
p181
aVthat hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom \u2014
p182
aVand converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.
p183
aa(lp184
VDG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.
p185
aVHe's managed to grab a tip of these worms.
p186
aVNow, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
p187
aVOh! Good going.
p188
aVSo, as soon as a crab touches them,
p189
aVthey retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
p190
aVThere's a whole story being played out here
p191
aVthat we're just now beginning to have some idea of
p192
aVbecause of this new camera technology.
p193
aa(lp194
VBL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.
p195
aVTheir foot is at about 200 degrees C
p196
aVand their head is out at three degrees C,
p197
aVso it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.
p198
aVThat's how they like to live.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VDG: This is a female of this kind of worm.
p202
aVAnd here's a male.
p203
aVYou watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here \u2014
p204
aVthis one and one that will show up over here \u2014 start to fight.
p205
aVEverything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.
p206
aVThere are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
p207
aVHere they go.
p208
aVOn one of the last dive series,
p209
aVwe counted 200 species in these areas \u2014
p210
aV198 were new, new species.
p211
aa(lp212
VBL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists
p213
aVworking at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.
p214
aVAnd they disintegrate on the way up,
p215
aVso the imagery is critical for the science.
p216
aa(lp217
VDG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.
p218
aVThis pressure thing really amazes me \u2014
p219
aVthat these animals can exist there at a depth
p220
aVwith pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
p221
aVWhat we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
p222
aVThis is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
p223
aVYou can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,
p224
aVand he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd the same thing's going on over here.
p228
aVWhat they're getting at is that \u2014 on the back of this crab \u2014
p229
aVthe foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria
p230
aVthat lives on the backs of all these animals.
p231
aVAnd what these shrimp are trying to do
p232
aVis actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.
p233
aVAnd the crabs don't like it at all.
p234
aVThese long filaments that you see on the back of the crab
p235
aVare actually created by the product of that bacteria.
p236
aVSo, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.
p237
aVOn the back, you see this again.
p238
aVThe red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin
p239
aVto give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
p240
aVThose are all shrimp.
p241
aVYou see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.
p242
aVThey're clinging to a rock face
p243
aVand actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.
p244
aVHere's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
p245
aVThose pillars get up to several stories.
p246
aVSo here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape
p247
aVof pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
p248
aVinhabited by these very strange animals
p249
aVthat live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.
p250
aVThey don't need the sun at all.
p251
aa(lp252
VBL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?
p253
aVIt's actually a light-sensing organ.
p254
aVIt's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
p255
aVThe vents are emitting a black body radiation \u2014 an IR signature \u2014
p256
aVand so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.
p257
aa(lp258
VDG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range
p259
aVthat we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,
p260
aVas we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.
p261
aVThis is the first time we've ever tried this any place.
p262
aVWe're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
p263
aVWe're moving up one of these pillars.
p264
aVThis one's several stories tall.
p265
aVIn it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.
p266
aVThere's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.
p267
aVSo all of these are individual homes for worms.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow here's a closer view of that community.
p270
aVHere's crabs here, worms here.
p271
aVThere are smaller animals crawling around.
p272
aVHere's pagoda structures.
p273
aVI think this is the neatest-looking thing.
p274
aVI just can't get over this \u2014
p275
aVthat you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
p276
aVThis stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
p277
aVYou could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,
p278
aVand it's coming out all from it.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVIt's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,
p281
aVand it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
p282
aVAnd animals are thriving \u2014 and we probably came from here.
p283
aVThat's probably where we evolved from.
p284
aa(lp285
VBL: This bacteria that we've been talking about
p286
aVturns out to be the most simplest form of life found.
p287
aVThere are a number of groups that are proposing
p288
aVthat life evolved at these vent sites.
p289
aVAlthough the vent sites are short-lived \u2014
p290
aVan individual site may last only 10 years or so \u2014
p291
aVas an ecosystem they've been stable for millions \u2014 well, billions \u2014 of years.
p292
aa(lp293
VDG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.
p294
aVThere's a fish sitting here.
p295
aVHere's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,
p296
aVwaiting for that worm to stick his head out.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VBL: The biologists right now cannot explain
p300
aVwhy these animals are so active.
p301
aVThe worms are growing inches per week!
p302
aa(lp303
VDG: I already said that this site,
p304
aVfrom a human perspective, is toxic as hell.
p305
aVNot only that, but on top \u2014 the lifeblood \u2014
p306
aVthat plumbing system turns off every year or so.
p307
aVTheir plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.
p308
aVAnd then there's earthquakes,
p309
aVand then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,
p310
aVthat completely wipes the area out.
p311
aVDespite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.
p312
aVYou're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,
p313
aVhigher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
p314
aVIs it sensitive? Yes.
p315
aVIs it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
p316
aa(lp317
VI'll end up with saying one thing.
p318
aVThere's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,
p319
aVin the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
p320
aVIt's an incredible story.
p321
aVWhat we see when we look back in time,
p322
aVin those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.
p323
aVEverything on this planet \u2014 everything \u2014 works by cycles and rhythms.
p324
aVThe continents move apart. They come back together.
p325
aVOceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.
p326
aVEl Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
p327
aVWhat we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
p328
aVIt's just like music \u2014 it really is just like music.
p329
aVAnd what we're learning now is that
p330
aVyou can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,
p331
aV"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."
p332
aVIt's absurd. It's just absurd.
p333
aVSo, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going
p334
aVat all these different scales and work with it.
p335
aVLearn to manage it.
p336
aVThe concept of preservation is futile.
p337
aVConservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.
p338
aVThank you very much.
p339
aVThank you.
