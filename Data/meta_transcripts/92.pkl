VAbout 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development
p4
aVto Swedish undergraduate students.
p5
aVThat was after having spent about 20 years
p6
aVtogether with African institutions studying hunger in Africa,
p7
aVso I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.
p8
aVAnd I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute,
p9
aVan undergraduate course called Global Health.
p10
aVBut when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous.
p11
aVI thought, these students coming to us
p12
aVactually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems \u2014
p13
aVso I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about.
p14
aVSo I did a pre-test when they came.
p15
aVAnd one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one:
p16
aV"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"
p17
aa(lp18
VI put them together, so that in each pair of country,
p19
aVone has twice the child mortality of the other.
p20
aVAnd this means that it's much bigger a difference
p21
aVthan the uncertainty of the data.
p22
aVI won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey,
p23
aVwhich is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
p24
aVAnd these were the results of the Swedish students.
p25
aVI did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy,
p26
aVof course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.
p27
aVThat means that there was a place for a professor of international health
p28
aVand for my course.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut one late night, when I was compiling the report,
p33
aVI really realized my discovery.
p34
aVI have shown that Swedish top students
p35
aVknow statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VBecause the chimpanzee would score half right
p40
aVif I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey.
p41
aVThey would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there.
p42
aVThe problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.
p43
aa(lp44
VI did also an unethical study
p45
aVof the professors of the Karolinska Institute,
p46
aVthat hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine,
p47
aVand they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VThis is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate,
p52
aVbecause the data of what's happening in the world
p53
aVand the child health of every country is very well aware.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe did this software which displays it like this:
p56
aVevery bubble here is a country.
p57
aVThis country over here is China.
p58
aVThis is India.
p59
aVThe size of the bubble is the population,
p60
aVand on this axis here, I put fertility rate.
p61
aVBecause my students, what they said
p62
aVwhen they looked upon the world, and I asked them,
p63
aV"What do you really think about the world?"
p64
aVWell, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.'
p69
aVAnd 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World."
p70
aV"And what do you mean with Western world?" I said.
p71
aV"Well, that's long life and small family,
p72
aVand Third World is short life and large family."
p73
aa(lp74
VSo this is what I could display here.
p75
aVI put fertility rate here: number of children per woman:
p76
aVone, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.
p77
aVWe have very good data since 1962 \u2014 1960 about \u2014
p78
aVon the size of families in all countries.
p79
aVThe error margin is narrow.
p80
aVHere, I put life expectancy at birth,
p81
aVfrom 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.
p82
aVAnd 1962, there was really a group of countries here
p83
aVthat was industrialized countries,
p84
aVand they had small families and long lives.
p85
aVAnd these were the developing countries:
p86
aVthey had large families and they had relatively short lives.
p87
aVNow, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change.
p88
aVAre the students right? Is it still two types of countries?
p89
aVOr have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?
p90
aVOr have they got longer lives and live up there?
p91
aa(lp92
VLet's see. We stopped the world then.
p93
aVThis is all U.N. statistics that have been available.
p94
aVHere we go. Can you see there?
p95
aVIt's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.
p96
aVAll the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
p97
aVYour yellow ones here are the Arabic countries,
p98
aVand they get longer life, but not larger families.
p99
aVThe Africans are the green here. They still remain here.
p100
aVThis is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VIn the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries.
p105
aVBut now, Bangladesh \u2014 it's a miracle that happens in the '80s:
p106
aVthe imams start to promote family planning.
p107
aVThey move up into that corner.
p108
aVAnd in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic
p109
aVthat takes down the life expectancy of the African countries
p110
aVand all the rest of them move up into the corner,
p111
aVwhere we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause ends)
p116
aa(lp117
VLet me make a comparison directly
p118
aVbetween the United States of America and Vietnam.
p119
aV1964.
p120
aVAmerica had small families and long life;
p121
aVVietnam had large families and short lives.
p122
aVAnd this is what happens:
p123
aVthe data during the war indicate that even with all the death,
p124
aVthere was an improvement of life expectancy.
p125
aVBy the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam;
p126
aVthey went for smaller families.
p127
aVAnd the United States up there is getting for longer life,
p128
aVkeeping family size.
p129
aVAnd in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning
p130
aVand they go for market economy,
p131
aVand it moves faster even than social life.
p132
aVAnd today, we have in Vietnam
p133
aVthe same life expectancy and the same family size
p134
aVhere in Vietnam, 2003,
p135
aVas in United States, 1974, by the end of the war.
p136
aVIf we don't look in the data,
p137
aVI think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia,
p138
aVwhich was in social change before we saw the economical change.
p139
aa(lp140
VLet's move over to another way here in which we could display
p141
aVthe distribution in the world of the income.
p142
aVThis is the world distribution of income of people.
p143
aVOne dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
p144
aVThere's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth.
p145
aVThere's a little hump here.
p146
aVBut there are people all the way.
p147
aVAnd if we look where the income ends up,
p148
aVthis is 100 percent the world's annual income.
p149
aVAnd the richest 20 percent,
p150
aVthey take out of that about 74 percent.
p151
aVAnd the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent.
p152
aVAnd this shows that the concept of developing countries
p153
aVis extremely doubtful.
p154
aVWe think about aid,
p155
aVlike these people here giving aid to these people here.
p156
aVBut in the middle, we have most of the world population,
p157
aVand they have now 24 percent of the income.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe heard it in other forms. And who are these?
p160
aVWhere are the different countries? I can show you Africa.
p161
aVThis is Africa.
p162
aV10% the world population, most in poverty.
p163
aVThis is OECD.
p164
aVThe rich country. The country club of the U.N.
p165
aVAnd they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.
p166
aVAnd this is Latin America.
p167
aVIt has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest
p168
aVin Latin America.
p169
aVAnd on top of that, we can put East Europe,
p170
aVwe can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd how did it look like if we go back in time,
p173
aVto about 1970?
p174
aVThen there was more of a hump.
p175
aVAnd we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.
p176
aVThe problem in the world was the poverty in Asia.
p177
aVAnd if I now let the world move forward,
p178
aVyou will see that while population increases,
p179
aVthere are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty
p180
aVand some others getting into poverty,
p181
aVand this is the pattern we have today.
p182
aVAnd the best projection from the World Bank
p183
aVis that this will happen,
p184
aVand we will not have a divided world.
p185
aVWe'll have most people in the middle.
p186
aa(lp187
VOf course it's a logarithmic scale here,
p188
aVbut our concept of economy is growth with percent.
p189
aVWe look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
p190
aVIf I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income,
p191
aVand I turn these individual data
p192
aVinto regional data of gross domestic product,
p193
aVand I take the regions down here,
p194
aVthe size of the bubble is still the population.
p195
aVAnd you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,
p196
aVand we take off the Arab states there,
p197
aVcoming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately,
p198
aVand we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here,
p199
aVby adding the social values there, child survival.
p200
aVNow I have money on that axis,
p201
aVand I have the possibility of children to survive there.
p202
aVIn some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age;
p203
aVothers, only 70.
p204
aVAnd here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD,
p205
aVLatin America, East Europe, East Asia,
p206
aVArab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
p207
aVThe linearity is very strong between child survival and money.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
p210
aVHealth is there and better health is up there.
p211
aVI can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.
p212
aVAnd when it burst,
p213
aVthe size of its country bubble is the size of the population.
p214
aVSierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there.
p215
aVMauritius was the first country
p216
aVto get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar \u2014
p217
aVthey could sell their textiles \u2014
p218
aVon equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.
p219
aa(lp220
VThere's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle.
p221
aVIn Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
p222
aVHere in Uganda, development aid.
p223
aVHere, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.
p224
aVIt's a tremendous variation within Africa
p225
aVwhich we rarely often make \u2014 that it's equal everything.
p226
aVI can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle.
p227
aVBut a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
p228
aVI can split Arab states. How are they?
p229
aVSame climate, same culture, same religion \u2014 huge difference.
p230
aVEven between neighbors.
p231
aVYemen, civil war.
p232
aVUnited Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used.
p233
aVNot as the myth is.
p234
aVAnd that includes all the children of the foreign workers
p235
aVwho are in the country.
p236
aa(lp237
VData is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad.
p238
aVThere is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here:
p239
aVCambodia, Singapore.
p240
aVThe differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
p241
aVEast Europe: Soviet economy for a long time,
p242
aVbut they come out after 10 years very, very differently.
p243
aVAnd there is Latin America.
p244
aVToday, we don't have to go to Cuba
p245
aVto find a healthy country in Latin America.
p246
aVChile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.
p247
aVHere, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd we get the whole pattern here of the world,
p250
aVwhich is more or less like this.
p251
aVAnd if we look at it, how the world looks,
p252
aVin 1960, it starts to move.
p253
aVThis is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China.
p254
aVAnd then he died.
p255
aVAnd then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China,
p256
aVand brought them into the mainstream again.
p257
aVAnd we have seen how countries move in different directions like this,
p258
aVso it's sort of difficult to get an example country
p259
aVwhich shows the pattern of the world.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960.
p262
aVI would like to compare
p263
aVSouth Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.
p264
aVThe label went away for me here.
p265
aVAnd I would like to compare Uganda, which is there.
p266
aVAnd I can run it forward, like this.
p267
aVAnd you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement,
p268
aVwhereas Brazil is much slower.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this,
p271
aVyou can see again that the speed of development
p272
aVis very, very different,
p273
aVand the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health,
p274
aVbut it seems you can move much faster
p275
aVif you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.
p276
aVAnd to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates.
p277
aVThey came from here, a mineral country.
p278
aVThey cached all the oil; they got all the money;
p279
aVbut health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
p280
aVYou have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling.
p281
aVYou have to train health staff. You have to educate the population.
p282
aVAnd Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.
p283
aVIn spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.
p284
aVSo we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world,
p285
aVwhere all countries tend to use their money
p286
aVbetter than they used in the past.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries \u2014
p289
aVthey are like this.
p290
aVNow that's dangerous, to use average data,
p291
aVbecause there is such a lot of difference within countries.
p292
aVSo if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today
p293
aVis where South Korea was in 1960.
p294
aVIf I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda.
p295
aVThese are the quintiles of Uganda.
p296
aVThe richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
p297
aVThe poorest are down there.
p298
aVIf I split South Africa, it's like this.
p299
aVAnd if I go down and look at Niger,
p300
aVwhere there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.
p301
aVThe 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here,
p302
aVand the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there,
p303
aVand yet we tend to discuss
p304
aVon what solutions there should be in Africa.
p305
aVEverything in this world exists in Africa.
p306
aVAnd you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine]
p307
aVfor that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here.
p308
aVThe improvement of the world must be highly contextualized,
p309
aVand it's not relevant to have it on regional level.
p310
aVWe must be much more detailed.
p311
aVWe find that students get very excited when they can use this.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors
p314
aVwould like to see how the world is changing.
p315
aVNow, why doesn't this take place?
p316
aVWhy are we not using the data we have?
p317
aVWe have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies
p318
aVand in universities and other non-governmental organizations.
p319
aVBecause the data is hidden down in the databases.
p320
aVAnd the public is there, and the Internet is there,
p321
aVbut we have still not used it effectively.
p322
aa(lp323
VAll that information we saw changing in the world
p324
aVdoes not include publicly-funded statistics.
p325
aVThere are some web pages like this, you know,
p326
aVbut they take some nourishment down from the databases,
p327
aVbut people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd this won't work.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Applause)
p334
aa(lp335
VSo what is needed? We have the databases.
p336
aVIt's not the new database you need.
p337
aVWe have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here.
p338
aVSo we started a nonprofit venture
p339
aVwhich, linking data to design, we called Gapminder,
p340
aVfrom the London Underground,
p341
aVwhere they warn you, "mind the gap."
p342
aVSo we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
p343
aVAnd we started to write software which could link the data like this.
p344
aVAnd it wasn't that difficult.
p345
aVIt took some person years, and we have produced animations.
p346
aVYou can take a data set and put it there.
p347
aVWe are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.
p348
aa(lp349
VSome countries accept that their databases can go out on the world,
p350
aVbut what we really need is, of course, a search function.
p351
aVA search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format
p352
aVand get it out in the world.
p353
aVAnd what do we hear when we go around?
p354
aVI've done anthropology on the main statistical units.
p355
aVEveryone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done.
p356
aVOur information is so peculiar in detail,
p357
aVso that cannot be searched as others can be searched.
p358
aVWe cannot give the data free to the students,
p359
aVfree to the entrepreneurs of the world."
p360
aa(lp361
VBut this is what we would like to see, isn't it?
p362
aVThe publicly-funded data is down here.
p363
aVAnd we would like flowers to grow out on the Net.
p364
aVAnd one of the crucial points is to make them searchable,
p365
aVand then people can use the different design tool to animate it there.
p366
aVAnd I have pretty good news for you.
p367
aVI have good news that the present,
p368
aVnew Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible.
p369
aVHe only says, "We can't do it."
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd that's a quite clever guy, huh?
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VSo we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.
p378
aVWe will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
p379
aVThis is the income distribution of China, 1970.
p380
aVThis is the income distribution of the United States, 1970.
p381
aVAlmost no overlap.
p382
aVAnd what has happened?
p383
aVWhat has happened is this:
p384
aVthat China is growing, it's not so equal any longer,
p385
aVand it's appearing here, overlooking the United States.
p386
aVAlmost like a ghost, isn't it?
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VIt's pretty scary.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VBut I think it's very important to have all this information.
p395
aVWe need really to see it.
p396
aVAnd instead of looking at this,
p397
aVI would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000.
p398
aVIn this software, we access about 500 variables
p399
aVfrom all the countries quite easily.
p400
aVIt takes some time to change for this,
p401
aVbut on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
p402
aVAnd the thing would be to get up the databases free,
p403
aVto get them searchable, and with a second click,
p404
aVto get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.
p405
aVNow, statisticians don't like it,
p406
aVbecause they say that this will not show the reality;
p407
aVwe have to have statistical, analytical methods.
p408
aVBut this is hypothesis-generating.
p409
aa(lp410
VI end now with the world.
p411
aVThere, the Internet is coming.
p412
aVThe number of Internet users are going up like this.
p413
aVThis is the GDP per capita.
p414
aVAnd it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly,
p415
aVhow well it fits to the economy of the countries.
p416
aVThat's why the $100 computer will be so important.
p417
aVBut it's a nice tendency.
p418
aVIt's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it?
p419
aVThese countries are lifting more than the economy
p420
aVand will be very interesting to follow this over the year,
p421
aVas I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.
p422
aa(lp423
VThank you very much.
