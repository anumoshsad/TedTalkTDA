VI have spent the last years
p4
aVtrying to resolve two enigmas:
p5
aVWhy is productivity so disappointing
p6
aVin all the companies where I work?
p7
aVI have worked with more than 500 companies.
p8
aVDespite all the technological advances \u2014
p9
aVcomputers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,
p10
aVthe Internet.
p11
aVEnigma number two:
p12
aVWhy is there so little engagement at work?
p13
aVWhy do people feel so miserable,
p14
aVeven actively disengaged?
p15
aVDisengaging their colleagues.
p16
aVActing against the interest of their company.
p17
aVDespite all the affiliation events,
p18
aVthe celebration, the people initiatives,
p19
aVthe leadership development programs to train
p20
aVmanagers on how to better motivate their teams.
p21
aa(lp22
VAt the beginning, I thought there was
p23
aVa chicken and egg issue:
p24
aVBecause people are less engaged,  they are less productive.
p25
aVOr vice versa, because they are less productive,
p26
aVwe put more pressure and they are less engaged.
p27
aVBut as we were doing our analysis
p28
aVwe realized that there was a common root cause
p29
aVto these two issues
p30
aVthat relates, in fact, to the basic  pillars of management.
p31
aVThe way we organize is based on two pillars.
p32
aVThe hard \u2014 structure, processes, systems.
p33
aVThe soft \u2014
p34
aVfeelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality.
p35
aVAnd whenever a company
p36
aVreorganizes, restructures, reengineers,
p37
aVgoes through a cultural transformation program,
p38
aVit chooses these two pillars.
p39
aVNow, we try to refine them,
p40
aVwe try to combine them.
p41
aVThe real issue is \u2014
p42
aVand this is the answer to the two enigmas \u2014
p43
aVthese pillars are obsolete.
p44
aVEverything you read in business books is based
p45
aVeither on one or the other
p46
aVor their combination.
p47
aVThey are obsolete.
p48
aVHow do they work
p49
aVwhen you try to use these approaches
p50
aVin front of the new complexity of business?
p51
aVThe hard approach, basically  is that you start from strategy,
p52
aVrequirements, structures, processes,  systems, KPIs, scorecards,
p53
aVcommittees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,
p54
aVyou name it.
p55
aVI forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees,  middle offices and interfaces.
p56
aVWhat happens basically on the left,
p57
aVyou have more complexity, the  new complexity of business.
p58
aVWe need quality, cost, reliability, speed.
p59
aVAnd every time there is a new requirement,
p60
aVwe use the same approach.
p61
aVWe create dedicated structure processed systems,
p62
aVbasically to deal with the  new complexity of business.
p63
aVThe hard approach creates just complicatedness
p64
aVin the organization.
p65
aa(lp66
VLet's take an example.
p67
aVAn automotive company, the engineering division
p68
aVis a five-dimensional matrix.
p69
aVIf you open any cell of the matrix,
p70
aVyou find another 20-dimensional matrix.
p71
aVYou have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,
p72
aVMr. Anti-Collision Properties.
p73
aVFor any new requirement,
p74
aVyou have a dedicated function
p75
aVin charge of aligning engineers against
p76
aVthe new requirement.
p77
aVWhat happens when the new  requirement emerges?
p78
aVSome years ago, a new requirement
p79
aVappeared on the marketplace:
p80
aVthe length of the warranty period.
p81
aVSo therefore the new requirement is repairability,
p82
aVmaking cars easy to repair.
p83
aVOtherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light,
p84
aVif you have to remove the engine
p85
aVto access the lights,
p86
aVthe car will have to stay one week in the garage
p87
aVinstead of two hours, and the  warranty budget will explode.
p88
aVSo, what was the solution using the hard approach?
p89
aVIf repairability is the new requirement,
p90
aVthe solution is to create a new function,
p91
aVMr. Repairability.
p92
aVAnd Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process.
p93
aVWith a repairability scorecard,  with a repairability metric
p94
aVand eventually repairability incentive.
p95
aVThat came on top of 25 other KPIs.
p96
aVWhat percentage of these people is variable compensation?
p97
aVTwenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,
p98
aVrepairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.
p99
aVWhat difference did it make in their actions,
p100
aVtheir choices to simplify? Zero.
p101
aVBut what occurs for zero impact?  Mr. Repairability, process,
p102
aVscorecard, evaluation, coordination  with the 25 other coordinators
p103
aVto have zero impact.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, in front of the new complexity of business,
p106
aVthe only solution is not drawing boxes
p107
aVwith reporting lines.
p108
aVIt is basically the interplay.
p109
aVHow the parts work together.
p110
aVThe connections, the interactions, the synapses.
p111
aVIt is not the skeleton of boxes,  it is the nervous system
p112
aVof adaptiveness and intelligence.
p113
aVYou know, you could call it cooperation, basically.
p114
aVWhenever people cooperate,
p115
aVthey use less resources. In everything.
p116
aVYou know, the repairability issue
p117
aVis a cooperation problem.
p118
aVWhen you design cars, please take into account
p119
aVthe needs of those who will repair the cars
p120
aVin the after sales garages.
p121
aVWhen we don't cooperate we need more time,
p122
aVmore equipment, more systems, more teams.
p123
aVWe need \u2014 When procurement, supply  chain, manufacturing don't cooperate
p124
aVwe need more stock, more inventories,  more working capital.
p125
aVWho will pay for that?
p126
aVShareholders? Customers?
p127
aVNo, they will refuse.
p128
aVSo who is left?  The employees,
p129
aVwho have to compensate through their super
p130
aVindividual efforts for the lack of cooperation.
p131
aVStress, burnout, they are  overwhelmed, accidents.
p132
aVNo wonder they disengage.
p133
aVHow do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation?
p134
aVThe hard: In banks, when there is a problem
p135
aVbetween the back office and the front office,
p136
aVthey don't cooperate. What is the solution?
p137
aVThey create a middle office.
p138
aVWhat happens one year later?
p139
aVInstead of one problem  between the back and the front,
p140
aVnow I have two problems.
p141
aVBetween the back and the middle
p142
aVand between the middle and the front.
p143
aVPlus I have to pay for the middle office.
p144
aVThe hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.
p145
aVIt can only add new boxes,  new bones in the skeleton.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe soft approach:
p148
aVTo make people cooperate, we need  to make them like each other.
p149
aVImprove interpersonal feelings,
p150
aVthe more people like each other,  the more they will cooperate.
p151
aVIt is totally wrong.
p152
aVIt is even counterproductive.
p153
aVLook, at home I have two TVs. Why?
p154
aVPrecisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVNot to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.
p157
aVAnd why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife
p158
aVis precisely because I love my wife.
p159
aVIf I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:
p160
aVYou will watch my favorite football game,
p161
aVif you are not happy, how is the book or the door?
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVThe more we like each other,
p164
aVthe more we avoid the real cooperation
p165
aVthat would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs.
p166
aVAnd we go for a second TV or we escalate
p167
aVthe decision above for arbitration.
p168
aVDefinitely, these approaches are obsolete.
p169
aa(lp170
VTo deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,
p171
aVwe have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach
p172
aVbased on simple rules.
p173
aVSimple rule number one:
p174
aVUnderstand what others do.
p175
aVWhat is their real work?
p176
aVWe need to go beyond the boxes,
p177
aVthe job descriptions, beyond the surface
p178
aVof the container, to understand the real content.
p179
aVMe, designer, if I put a wire here,
p180
aVI know that it will mean that we will have to
p181
aVremove the engine to access the lights.
p182
aVSecond, you need to reenforce integrators.
p183
aVIntegrators are not middle  offices, they are managers,
p184
aVexisting managers that you reinforce
p185
aVso that they have power and interest
p186
aVto make others cooperate.
p187
aVHow can you reinforce your  managers as integrators?
p188
aVBy removing layers.
p189
aVWhen there are too many layers
p190
aVpeople are too far from the action,
p191
aVtherefore they need KPIs, metrics,
p192
aVthey need poor proxies for reality.
p193
aVThey don't understand reality
p194
aVand they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.
p195
aVBy removing rules \u2014 the bigger we are,
p196
aVthe more we need integrators,
p197
aVtherefore the less rules we must have,
p198
aVto give discretionary power to managers.
p199
aVAnd we do the opposite \u2014
p200
aVthe bigger we are, the more rules we create.
p201
aVAnd we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules.
p202
aVYou need to increase the quanitity of power
p203
aVso that you can empower everybody
p204
aVto use their judgment, their intelligence.
p205
aVYou must give more cards to people
p206
aVso that they have the critical mass of cards
p207
aVto take the risk to cooperate,
p208
aVto move out of insulation.
p209
aVOtherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.
p210
aVThese rules, they come from game theory
p211
aVand organizational sociology.
p212
aVYou can increase the shadow of the future.
p213
aVCreate feedback loops that expose people
p214
aVto the consequences of their actions.
p215
aVThis is what the automotive company did
p216
aVwhen they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.
p217
aVThey said to the design engineers:
p218
aVNow, in three years, when the new  car is launched on the market,
p219
aVyou will move to the after sales  network, and become in charge
p220
aVof the warranty budget,
p221
aVand if the warranty budget explodes,
p222
aVit will explode in your face. (Laughter)
p223
aVMuch more powerful than 0.8  percent variable compensation.
p224
aVYou need also to increase reciprocity,
p225
aVby removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.
p226
aVWhen you remove these buffers,
p227
aVyou hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.
p228
aVWe will cooperate.
p229
aVRemove the second TV.
p230
aVThere are many second TVs at work
p231
aVthat don't create value,
p232
aVthey just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.
p233
aVYou need to reward those who cooperate
p234
aVand blame those who don't cooperate.
p235
aVThe CEO of The Lego Group,
p236
aVJorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.
p237
aVHe says, blame is not for failure,
p238
aVit is for failing to help or ask for help.
p239
aVIt changes everything.
p240
aVSuddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent
p241
aVon my real weaknesses, my real forecast,
p242
aVbecause I know I will not be blamed if I fail,
p243
aVbut if I fail to help or ask for help.
p244
aVWhen you do this, it has a lot of implications
p245
aVon organizational design.
p246
aVYou stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;
p247
aVyou look at their interplay.
p248
aVIt has a lot of implications on financial policies
p249
aVthat we use.
p250
aVOn human resource management practices.
p251
aVWhen you do that, you can manage complexity,
p252
aVthe new complexity of business,
p253
aVwithout getting complicated.
p254
aVYou create more value with lower cost.
p255
aVYou simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work
p256
aVbecause you have removed the common root cause
p257
aVthat hinders both.
p258
aVComplicatedness: This is your  battle, business leaders.
p259
aVThe real battle is not against competitors.
p260
aVThis is rubbish, very abstract.
p261
aVWhen do we meet competitors to fight them?
p262
aVThe real battle is against ourselves,
p263
aVagainst our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.
p264
aVOnly you can fight, can do it.
p265
aVThank you.
