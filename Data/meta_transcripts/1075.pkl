VI want you to take a look at this baby.
p4
aVWhat you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch.
p5
aVBut today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see.
p6
aVWhat's going on up in that little brain of hers.
p7
aVThe modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us
p8
aVthat what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.
p9
aVAnd what we're learning is going to shed some light
p10
aVon what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness"
p11
aVof the child's mind.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat we see here is a mother in India,
p14
aVand she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language.
p15
aVAnd she's talking to her baby.
p16
aVWhat this mother \u2014
p17
aVand the 800 people who speak Koro in the world \u2014
p18
aVunderstands is that, to preserve this language,
p19
aVthey need to speak it to the babies.
p20
aVAnd therein lies a critical puzzle.
p21
aVWhy is it that you can't preserve a language
p22
aVby speaking to you and I, to the adults?
p23
aVWell, it's got to do with your brain.
p24
aVWhat we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.
p25
aVThe way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.
p30
aVThe babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven,
p31
aVand then there's a systematic decline.
p32
aVAfter puberty, we fall off the map.
p33
aVNo scientists dispute this curve,
p34
aVbut laboratories all over the world
p35
aVare trying to figure out why it works this way.
p36
aa(lp37
VWork in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development,
p38
aVand that is the period in which babies
p39
aVtry to master which sounds are used in their language.
p40
aVWe think, by studying how the sounds are learned,
p41
aVwe'll have a model for the rest of language,
p42
aVand perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood
p43
aVfor social, emotional and cognitive development.
p44
aVSo we've been studying the babies
p45
aVusing a technique that we're using all over the world
p46
aVand the sounds of all languages.
p47
aVThe baby sits on a parent's lap,
p48
aVand we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes \u2014
p49
aVlike from "ah" to "ee."
p50
aVIf they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up
p51
aVand a panda bear pounds a drum.
p52
aVA six-monther adores the task.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhat have we learned?
p55
aVWell, babies all over the world
p56
aVare what I like to describe as "citizens of the world."
p57
aVThey can discriminate all the sounds of all languages,
p58
aVno matter what country we're testing and what language we're using,
p59
aVand that's remarkable because you and I can't do that.
p60
aVWe're culture-bound listeners.
p61
aVWe can discriminate the sounds of our own language,
p62
aVbut not those of foreign languages.
p63
aVSo the question arises: When do those citizens of the world
p64
aVturn into the language-bound listeners that we are?
p65
aVAnd the answer: before their first birthdays.
p66
aVWhat you see here is performance on that head-turn task
p67
aVfor babies tested in Tokyo and the United States,
p68
aVhere in Seattle,
p69
aVas they listened to "ra" and "la" \u2014
p70
aVsounds important to English, but not to Japanese.
p71
aVSo at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent.
p72
aVTwo months later, something incredible occurs.
p73
aVThe babies in the United States are getting a lot better,
p74
aVbabies in Japan are getting a lot worse,
p75
aVbut both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language
p76
aVthat they are going to learn.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period?
p79
aVThis is the critical period for sound development,
p80
aVbut what's going on up there?
p81
aVSo there are two things going on.
p82
aVThe first is that the babies are listening intently to us,
p83
aVand they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk \u2014
p84
aVthey're taking statistics.
p85
aVSo listen to two mothers speaking motherese \u2014
p86
aVthe universal language we use when we talk to kids \u2014
p87
aVfirst in English and then in Japanese.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes \u2014
p90
aVso pretty and nice.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Japanese)
p93
aa(lp94
VPatricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen,
p95
aVwhat they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear.
p96
aVAnd those distributions grow.
p97
aVAnd what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics,
p98
aVand the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different.
p99
aVEnglish has a lot of Rs and Ls.
p100
aVThe distribution shows.
p101
aVAnd the distribution of Japanese is totally different,
p102
aVwhere we see a group of intermediate sounds,
p103
aVwhich is known as the Japanese "R."
p104
aVSo babies absorb the statistics of the language
p105
aVand it changes their brains;
p106
aVit changes them from the citizens of the world
p107
aVto the culture-bound listeners that we are.
p108
aVBut we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.
p109
aVWe are governed by the representations in memory
p110
aVthat were formed early in development.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo what we're seeing here
p113
aVis changing our models of what the critical period is about.
p114
aVWe're arguing from a mathematical standpoint
p115
aVthat the learning of language material may slow down
p116
aVwhen our distributions stabilize.
p117
aVIt's raising lots of questions about bilingual people.
p118
aVBilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once
p119
aVand flip between them, one after the other,
p120
aVdepending on who they're speaking to.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo we asked ourselves,
p123
aVcan the babies take statistics on a brand new language?
p124
aVAnd we tested this by exposing American babies
p125
aVwho'd never heard a second language
p126
aVto Mandarin for the first time during the critical period.
p127
aVWe knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle
p128
aVon the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern.
p129
aVSix to eight months, they're totally equivalent.
p130
aVTwo months later, something incredible happens.
p131
aVBut the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies.
p132
aVWhat we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin.
p133
aVIt was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month
p134
aVand move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
p135
aVHere's what it looked like in the laboratory.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Mandarin)
p138
aa(lp139
VPK: So what have we done to their little brains?
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VWe had to run a control group to make sure
p144
aVthat coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills.
p145
aVSo a group of babies came in and listened to English.
p146
aVAnd we can see from the graph
p147
aVthat exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin.
p148
aVBut look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
p149
aVThey were as good as the babies in Taiwan
p150
aVwho'd been listening for 10 and a half months.
p151
aVWhat it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language.
p152
aVWhatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut we wondered what role
p155
aVthe human being played in this learning exercise.
p156
aVSo we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage,
p157
aVthe same 12 sessions, but over a television set.
p158
aVAnd another group of babies who had just audio exposure
p159
aVand looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
p160
aVWhat did we do to their brains?
p161
aVWhat you see here is the audio result \u2014
p162
aVno learning whatsoever \u2014
p163
aVand the video result \u2014
p164
aVno learning whatsoever.
p165
aVIt takes a human being for babies to take their statistics.
p166
aVThe social brain is controlling
p167
aVwhen the babies are taking their statistics.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening
p170
aVas babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings.
p171
aVThankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography,
p172
aVthat allows us to do this.
p173
aVIt looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
p174
aVBut it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent.
p175
aVWe're looking at millimeter accuracy
p176
aVwith regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy
p177
aVusing 306 SQUIDs \u2014
p178
aVthese are superconducting quantum interference devices \u2014
p179
aVto pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking.
p180
aVWe're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine
p181
aVwhile they are learning.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo this is little Emma.
p184
aVShe's a six-monther.
p185
aVAnd she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears.
p186
aVYou can see, she can move around.
p187
aVWe're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap,
p188
aVso she's free to move completely unconstrained.
p189
aVIt's a technical tour de force.
p190
aVWhat are we seeing?
p191
aVWe're seeing the baby brain.
p192
aVAs the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up,
p193
aVand then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence,
p194
aVgetting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality,
p195
aVone brain area causing another to activate.
p196
aa(lp197
VWe are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge
p198
aVabout child's brain development.
p199
aVWe're going to be able to see a child's brain
p200
aVas they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read,
p201
aVas they solve a math problem, as they have an idea.
p202
aVAnd we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions
p203
aVfor children who have difficulty learning.
p204
aVJust as the poets and writers described,
p205
aVwe're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness,
p206
aVutter and complete openness, of the mind of a child.
p207
aVIn investigating the child's brain,
p208
aVwe're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human,
p209
aVand in the process,
p210
aVwe may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning
p211
aVfor our entire lives.
