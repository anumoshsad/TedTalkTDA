VTechnology has brought us so much:
p4
aVthe moon landing, the Internet,
p5
aVthe ability to sequence the human genome.
p6
aVBut it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears,
p7
aVand about 30 years ago,
p8
aVthe culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book
p9
aVcalled "Amusing Ourselves to Death,"
p10
aVwhich lays this out really brilliantly.
p11
aVAnd here's what he said,
p12
aVcomparing the dystopian visions
p13
aVof George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.
p14
aVHe said, Orwell feared we would become
p15
aVa captive culture.
p16
aVHuxley feared we would become a trivial culture.
p17
aVOrwell feared the truth would be
p18
aVconcealed from us,
p19
aVand Huxley feared we would be drowned
p20
aVin a sea of irrelevance.
p21
aVIn a nutshell, it's a choice between
p22
aVBig Brother watching you
p23
aVand you watching Big Brother.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut it doesn't have to be this way.
p27
aVWe are not passive consumers of data and technology.
p28
aVWe shape the role it plays in our lives
p29
aVand the way we make meaning from it,
p30
aVbut to do that,
p31
aVwe have to pay as much attention to how we think
p32
aVas how we code.
p33
aVWe have to ask questions, and hard questions,
p34
aVto move past counting things
p35
aVto understanding them.
p36
aVWe're constantly bombarded with stories
p37
aVabout how much data there is in the world,
p38
aVbut when it comes to big data
p39
aVand the challenges of interpreting it,
p40
aVsize isn't everything.
p41
aVThere's also the speed at which it moves,
p42
aVand the many varieties of data types,
p43
aVand here are just a few examples:
p44
aVimages,
p45
aVtext,
p46
aVvideo,
p47
aVaudio.
p48
aVAnd what unites this disparate types of data
p49
aVis that they're created by people
p50
aVand they require context.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, there's a group of data scientists
p53
aVout of the University of Illinois-Chicago,
p54
aVand they're called the Health Media Collaboratory,
p55
aVand they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control
p56
aVto better understand
p57
aVhow people talk about quitting smoking,
p58
aVhow they talk about electronic cigarettes,
p59
aVand what they can do collectively
p60
aVto help them quit.
p61
aVThe interesting thing is, if you want to understand
p62
aVhow people talk about smoking,
p63
aVfirst you have to understand
p64
aVwhat they mean when they say "smoking."
p65
aVAnd on Twitter, there are four main categories:
p66
aVnumber one, smoking cigarettes;
p67
aVnumber two, smoking marijuana;
p68
aVnumber three, smoking ribs;
p69
aVand number four, smoking hot women.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo then you have to think about, well,
p73
aVhow do people talk about electronic cigarettes?
p74
aVAnd there are so many different ways
p75
aVthat people do this, and you can see from the slide
p76
aVit's a complex kind of a query.
p77
aVAnd what it reminds us is that
p78
aVlanguage is created by people,
p79
aVand people are messy and we're complex
p80
aVand we use metaphors and slang and jargon
p81
aVand we do this 24/7 in many, many languages,
p82
aVand then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo did these ads that the CDC put on,
p85
aVthese television ads that featured a woman
p86
aVwith a hole in her throat and that were very graphic
p87
aVand very disturbing,
p88
aVdid they actually have an impact
p89
aVon whether people quit?
p90
aVAnd the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data,
p91
aVbut they were able to conclude
p92
aVthat those advertisements \u2014 and you may have seen them \u2014
p93
aVthat they had the effect of jolting people
p94
aVinto a thought process
p95
aVthat may have an impact on future behavior.
p96
aVAnd what I admire and  appreciate about this project,
p97
aVaside from the fact, including the fact
p98
aVthat it's based on real human need,
p99
aVis that it's a fantastic example of courage
p100
aVin the face of a sea of irrelevance.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd so it's not just big data that causes
p103
aVchallenges of interpretation, because let's face it,
p104
aVwe human beings have a very rich history
p105
aVof taking any amount of data, no matter how small,
p106
aVand screwing it up.
p107
aVSo many years ago, you may remember
p108
aVthat former President Ronald Reagan
p109
aVwas very criticized for making a statement
p110
aVthat facts are stupid things.
p111
aVAnd it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair.
p112
aVHe actually meant to quote John Adams' defense
p113
aVof British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials
p114
aVthat facts are stubborn things.
p115
aVBut I actually think there's
p116
aVa bit of accidental wisdom in what he said,
p117
aVbecause facts are stubborn things,
p118
aVbut sometimes they're stupid, too.
p119
aa(lp120
VI want to tell you a personal story
p121
aVabout why this matters a lot to me.
p122
aVI need to take a breath.
p123
aVMy son Isaac, when he was two,
p124
aVwas diagnosed with autism,
p125
aVand he was this happy, hilarious,
p126
aVloving, affectionate little guy,
p127
aVbut the metrics on his developmental evaluations,
p128
aVwhich looked at things like  the number of words \u2014
p129
aVat that point, none \u2014
p130
aVcommunicative gestures and minimal eye contact,
p131
aVput his developmental level
p132
aVat that of a nine-month-old baby.
p133
aVAnd the diagnosis was factually correct,
p134
aVbut it didn't tell the whole story.
p135
aVAnd about a year and a half later,
p136
aVwhen he was almost four,
p137
aVI found him in front of the computer one day
p138
aVrunning a Google image search on women,
p139
aVspelled "w-i-m-e-n."
p140
aVAnd I did what any obsessed parent would do,
p141
aVwhich is immediately started  hitting the "back" button
p142
aVto see what else he'd been searching for.
p143
aVAnd they were, in order: men,
p144
aVschool, bus and computer.
p145
aVAnd I was stunned,
p146
aVbecause we didn't know that he could spell,
p147
aVmuch less read, and so I asked him,
p148
aV"Isaac, how did you do this?"
p149
aVAnd he looked at me very seriously and said,
p150
aV"Typed in the box."
p151
aa(lp152
VHe was teaching himself to communicate,
p153
aVbut we were looking in the wrong place,
p154
aVand this is what happens when assessments
p155
aVand analytics overvalue one metric \u2014
p156
aVin this case, verbal communication \u2014
p157
aVand undervalue others, such as creative problem-solving.
p158
aVCommunication was hard for Isaac,
p159
aVand so he found a workaround
p160
aVto find out what he needed to know.
p161
aVAnd when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense,
p162
aVbecause forming a question
p163
aVis a really complex process,
p164
aVbut he could get himself a lot of the way there
p165
aVby putting a word in a search box.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd so this little moment
p168
aVhad a really profound impact on me
p169
aVand our family
p170
aVbecause it helped us change our frame of reference
p171
aVfor what was going on with him,
p172
aVand worry a little bit less and appreciate
p173
aVhis resourcefulness more.
p174
aa(lp175
VFacts are stupid things.
p176
aVAnd they're vulnerable to misuse,
p177
aVwillful or otherwise.
p178
aVI have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist,
p179
aVand she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago
p180
aVentitled "The 10 Weirdest Things
p181
aVEver Linked to Autism."
p182
aVIt's quite a list.
p183
aVThe Internet, blamed for everything, right?
p184
aVAnd of course mothers, because.
p185
aVAnd actually, wait, there's more,
p186
aVthere's a whole bunch in  the "mother" category here.
p187
aVAnd you can see it's a pretty  rich and interesting list.
p188
aVI'm a big fan of
p189
aVbeing pregnant near freeways, personally.
p190
aVThe final one is interesting,
p191
aVbecause the term "refrigerator mother"
p192
aVwas actually the original hypothesis
p193
aVfor the cause of autism,
p194
aVand that meant somebody  who was cold and unloving.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd at this point, you might be thinking,
p197
aV"Okay, Susan, we get it,
p198
aVyou can take data, you can  make it mean anything."
p199
aVAnd this is true, it's absolutely true,
p200
aVbut the challenge is that
p201
aVwe have this opportunity
p202
aVto try to make meaning out of it ourselves,
p203
aVbecause frankly, data doesn't  create meaning. We do.
p204
aVSo as businesspeople, as consumers,
p205
aVas patients, as citizens,
p206
aVwe have a responsibility, I think,
p207
aVto spend more time
p208
aVfocusing on our critical thinking skills.
p209
aVWhy?
p210
aVBecause at this point in our history, as we've heard
p211
aVmany times over,
p212
aVwe can process exabytes of data
p213
aVat lightning speed,
p214
aVand we have the potential to make bad decisions
p215
aVfar more quickly, efficiently,
p216
aVand with far greater impact than we did in the past.
p217
aVGreat, right?
p218
aVAnd so what we need to do instead
p219
aVis spend a little bit more time
p220
aVon things like the humanities
p221
aVand sociology, and the social sciences,
p222
aVrhetoric, philosophy, ethics,
p223
aVbecause they give us context that is so important
p224
aVfor big data, and because
p225
aVthey help us become better critical thinkers.
p226
aVBecause after all, if I can spot
p227
aVa problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter
p228
aVwhether it's expressed in words or in numbers.
p229
aVAnd this means
p230
aVteaching ourselves to find  those confirmation biases
p231
aVand false correlations
p232
aVand being able to spot a naked emotional appeal
p233
aVfrom 30 yards,
p234
aVbecause something that happens after something
p235
aVdoesn't mean it happened  because of it, necessarily,
p236
aVand if you'll let me geek out on you for a second,
p237
aVthe Romans called this  "post hoc ergo propter hoc,"
p238
aVafter which therefore because of which.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd it means questioning disciplines like demographics.
p241
aVWhy? Because they're based on assumptions
p242
aVabout who we all are based on our gender
p243
aVand our age and where we live
p244
aVas opposed to data on what  we actually think and do.
p245
aVAnd since we have this data,
p246
aVwe need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls
p247
aVand consumer opt-in,
p248
aVand beyond that, we need to be clear
p249
aVabout our hypotheses,
p250
aVthe methodologies that we use,
p251
aVand our confidence in the result.
p252
aVAs my high school algebra teacher used to say,
p253
aVshow your math,
p254
aVbecause if I don't know what steps you took,
p255
aVI don't know what steps you didn't take,
p256
aVand if I don't know what questions you asked,
p257
aVI don't know what questions you didn't ask.
p258
aVAnd it means asking ourselves, really,
p259
aVthe hardest question of all:
p260
aVDid the data really show us this,
p261
aVor does the result make us feel
p262
aVmore successful and more comfortable?
p263
aa(lp264
VSo the Health Media Collaboratory,
p265
aVat the end of their project, they were able
p266
aVto find that 87 percent of tweets
p267
aVabout those very graphic and disturbing
p268
aVanti-smoking ads expressed fear,
p269
aVbut did they conclude
p270
aVthat they actually made people stop smoking?
p271
aVNo. It's science, not magic.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo if we are to unlock
p274
aVthe power of data,
p275
aVwe don't have to go blindly into
p276
aVOrwell's vision of a totalitarian future,
p277
aVor Huxley's vision of a trivial one,
p278
aVor some horrible cocktail of both.
p279
aVWhat we have to do
p280
aVis treat critical thinking with respect
p281
aVand be inspired by examples
p282
aVlike the Health Media Collaboratory,
p283
aVand as they say in the superhero movies,
p284
aVlet's use our powers for good.
p285
