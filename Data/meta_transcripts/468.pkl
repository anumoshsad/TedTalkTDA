VSo, my question:
p4
aVare we alone?
p5
aa(lp6
VThe story of humans is the story of ideas \u2014
p7
aVscientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,
p8
aVideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,
p9
aVideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,
p10
aVideas that have vanished in history,
p11
aVand ideas that have been set in dogma.
p12
aVIt's a story of nations,
p13
aVof ideologies,
p14
aVof territories,
p15
aVand of conflicts among them.
p16
aVBut, every moment of human history,
p17
aVfrom the Stone Age to the Information Age,
p18
aVfrom Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,
p19
aVthey've all been carried out \u2014
p20
aVevery book that you've read,
p21
aVevery poem, every laugh, every tear \u2014
p22
aVthey've all happened here.
p23
aVHere.
p24
aVHere.
p25
aVHere.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VPerspective is a very powerful thing.
p29
aVPerspectives can change.
p30
aVPerspectives can be altered.
p31
aVFrom my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,
p32
aVin a universe of possibilities.
p33
aVFor many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,
p34
aVanswers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,
p35
aVabout who we are and why we are,
p36
aVand of course, who else might be out there.
p37
aVIs it really just us?
p38
aVAre we alone in this vast universe
p39
aVof energy and matter and chemistry and physics?
p40
aVWell, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVBut, what if we're not?
p43
aa(lp44
VWhat if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?
p45
aVWhat if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,
p46
aVbut from the opposite side?
p47
aVWould the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there
p48
aVinspire us to find ways to survive
p49
aVour increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
p50
aVMight it be the discovery of a distant civilization
p51
aVand our common cosmic origins
p52
aVthat finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?
p53
aVWhether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,
p54
aVor close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,
p55
aVwe are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
p56
aVWe, all of us,
p57
aVare what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium
p58
aVevolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.
p59
aVFifty years ago,
p60
aVthe journey to find answers took a different path
p61
aVand SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,
p62
aVbegan.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, what exactly is SETI?
p65
aVWell, SETI uses the tools of astronomy
p66
aVto try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.
p67
aVOur own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,
p68
aVand theirs might be as well.
p69
aVIt might be that some massive network of communications,
p70
aVor some shield against asteroidal impact,
p71
aVor some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,
p72
aVcould generate signals at radio or optical frequencies
p73
aVthat a determined program of searching might detect.
p74
aVFor millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers
p75
aVfor guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.
p76
aVNow, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,
p77
aVrather than ask what should be, believed.
p78
aa(lp79
VSETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;
p80
aVit merely notes the possibility, if not the probability
p81
aVin this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.
p82
aVThe numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
p83
aVOur sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,
p84
aVand we know that many other stars have planetary systems.
p85
aVWe've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,
p86
aVincluding the small planet, announced earlier this week,
p87
aVwhich has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.
p88
aVAnd, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,
p89
aVthere are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,
p90
aValtogether 10^22 stars.
p91
aVNow, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.
p92
aVRemember, one billion?
p93
aVBut, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.
p94
aVAlright, one billion stars.
p95
aVNow, up there, 20 feet above the stage,
p96
aVthat's 10 trillion.
p97
aVWell, what about 10^22?
p98
aVWhere's the line that marks that?
p99
aVThat line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aV16 times farther away than the moon,
p102
aVor four percent of the distance to the sun.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, there are many possibilities.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVAnd much of this vast universe,
p107
aVmuch more may be habitable than we once thought,
p108
aVas we study extremophiles on Earth \u2014
p109
aVorganisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,
p110
aVin the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,
p111
aVfrozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,
p112
aVin the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.
p113
aVThese extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
p116
aVEven our nearest star, the Sun \u2014
p117
aVits emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.
p118
aVIt takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.
p119
aVAnd the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,
p120
aVwhich means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.
p121
aVAnd the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,
p122
aVand the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.
p123
aVThat means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.
p124
aVAnd a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,
p125
aVnot their present.
p126
aVWhich is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."
p127
aVIt tells us about their past,
p128
aVbut detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.
p129
aa(lp130
VI think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,
p131
aVwhen he ended his Oxford TEDTalk
p132
aVby saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,
p133
aVand he would like to carve them on stone tablets.
p134
aVThe first is that problems are inevitable.
p135
aVThe second is that problems are soluble.
p136
aVSo, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI
p137
aVis the longevity of technologies,
p138
aVand the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos \u2014
p139
aVdistance over space and distance over time.
p140
aVIf technologies don't last and persist,
p141
aVwe will not succeed.
p142
aVAnd we're a very young technology
p143
aVin an old galaxy,
p144
aVand we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.
p147
aVLet me talk about a relatively small number.
p148
aVAnd that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.
p149
aVZircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,
p150
aVzircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia
p151
aVtell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet
p152
aVthere was abundant water and perhaps even life.
p153
aVSo, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history
p154
aVdeveloping life,
p155
aVnot anticipating its emergence.
p156
aVLife happened very quickly,
p157
aVand that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd the other thing that one should take away from this chart
p160
aVis the very narrow range of time
p161
aVover which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.
p162
aVIt's only the last few hundred thousand years
p163
aVmodern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.
p164
aVSo, one needs a very deep appreciation
p165
aVof the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet
p166
aVas the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe are not the pinnacle of evolution.
p169
aVWe are not the determined product
p170
aVof billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.
p171
aVWe are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.
p172
aVWe are residents of one small planet
p173
aVin a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.
p174
aVAnd Homo sapiens are one small leaf
p175
aVon a very extensive Tree of Life,
p176
aVwhich is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival
p177
aVover millions of years.
p178
aVWe misuse language,
p179
aVand talk about the "ascent" of man.
p180
aVWe understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life
p181
aVbut our ego hasn't caught up yet.
p182
aVSo this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,
p183
aVhas got to go.
p184
aVIt's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.
p185
aa(lp186
VLoren Eiseley has said,
p187
aV"One does not meet oneself
p188
aVuntil one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."
p189
aVOne day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,
p190
aVand the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution
p191
aVthe sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.
p192
aa(lp193
VWe are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,
p194
aVand we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,
p195
aVand perhaps SETI will help as well.
p196
aVOccasionally, throughout history, this concept
p197
aVof this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,
p198
aVand as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.
p199
aVSo in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,"
p200
aVand by taking the Earth out of the center,
p201
aVand putting the sun in the center of the solar system,
p202
aVhe opened our eyes to a much larger universe,
p203
aVof which we are just a small part.
p204
aVAnd that Copernican revolution continues today
p205
aVto influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison
p208
aVpublished the first SETI article in a refereed journal,
p209
aVand brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.
p210
aVAnd in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation
p211
aVlooking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,
p212
aVfor about 150 hours.
p213
aVNow Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,
p214
aVbut he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,
p215
aVand that's that terrestrial technology can interfere
p216
aVwith the search for extraterrestrial technology.
p217
aa(lp218
VWe've been searching ever since,
p219
aVbut it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.
p220
aVAll of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,
p221
aVare equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.
p222
aVAnd no one would decide that the ocean was without fish
p223
aVon the basis of one glass of water.
p224
aVThe 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses \u2014
p225
aVmuch bigger glasses.
p226
aVIn Northern California, we're beginning to take observations
p227
aVwith the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array \u2014
p228
aVand I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank
p229
aVPaul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold
p230
aVand all the TeamSETI members in the TED community
p231
aVwho have so generously supported this research.
p232
aV(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VThe ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,
p235
aVand hooked together with computers.
p236
aVIt's making silicon as important as aluminum,
p237
aVand we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350
p238
aVfor more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.
p239
aVToday, our signal detection algorithms
p240
aVcan find very simple artifacts and noise.
p241
aVIf you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
p242
aVthe most distant human object in the universe,
p243
aV106 times as far away from us as the sun is.
p244
aVAnd over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
p245
aVIt may be hard for your eye to see it,
p246
aVbut it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.
p247
aVBut this is a simple signal,
p248
aVand tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.
p249
aa(lp250
VThis is a very good year.
p251
aV2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,
p252
aVDarwin's 200th birthday,
p253
aVthe 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,"
p254
aVthe 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,
p255
aVthe 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,
p256
aVand of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.
p257
aVAnd next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch
p258
aVand will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,
p259
aVthe targets for SETI's searches.
p260
aVIn 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,
p261
aVa global festival to help us residents of Earth
p262
aVrediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.
p263
aVAnd in 2009, change has come to Washington,
p264
aVwith a promise to put science in its rightful position.
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, what would change everything?
p268
aVWell, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,
p269
aVand four of the respondents said, "SETI."
p270
aVWhy?
p271
aVWell, to quote:
p272
aV"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth
p273
aVwould eradicate the loneliness and solipsism
p274
aVthat has plagued our species since its inception.
p275
aVAnd it wouldn't simply change everything,
p276
aVit would change everything all at once."
p277
aVSo, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?
p278
aVI think it's a problem of completion and delivery,
p279
aVbecause the fine print said,
p280
aV"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments
p281
aVwould you expect to live to see?"
p282
aVSo, we have a fulfillment problem.
p283
aVWe need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,
p284
aVand then working together, maybe we can all live to see
p285
aVthe detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.
p286
aa(lp287
VThat brings me to my wish.
p288
aVI wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere
p289
aVto become active participants
p290
aVin the ultimate search for cosmic company.
p291
aa(lp292
VThe first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,
p293
aVto build an environment where raw data could be stored,
p294
aVand where it could be accessed and manipulated,
p295
aVwhere new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.
p296
aVAnd this is a technically creative challenge,
p297
aVand it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.
p298
aVAnd then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.
p299
aVWe'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye
p300
aVto find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.
p303
aVWe'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,
p304
aVand get them out to students everywhere,
p305
aVstudents that can't come and visit us at the ATA.
p306
aVWe'd like to tell our story better,
p307
aVand engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.
p308
aa(lp309
VI'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.
p310
aVWe've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet
p311
aVinto smaller islands.
p312
aVAnd, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,
p313
aVto Earthlings.
p314
aVAnd SETI is a mirror \u2014
p315
aVa mirror that can show us ourselves
p316
aVfrom an extraordinary perspective,
p317
aVand can help to trivialize the differences among us.
p318
aVIf SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,
p319
aVthen it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, in the opening days of 2009,
p322
aVa visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol
p323
aVand said, "We cannot help but believe
p324
aVthat the old hatreds shall someday pass,
p325
aVthat the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,
p326
aVthat, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."
p327
aVSo, I look forward to working with the TED community
p328
aVto hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,
p329
aVand in collaborating with you,
p330
aVhasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.
p331
aa(lp332
VThank you.
