VFive years ago, I experienced a bit
p4
aVof what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
p5
aVPenn State asked me, a communications teacher,
p6
aVto teach a communications class for engineering students.
p7
aVAnd I was scared. (Laughter)
p8
aVReally scared. Scared of these students with their big brains
p9
aVand their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.
p10
aVBut as these conversations unfolded,
p11
aVI experienced what Alice must have when she went down
p12
aVthat rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
p13
aVThat's just how I felt as I had those conversations
p14
aVwith the students. I was amazed at the ideas
p15
aVthat they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
p16
aVAnd I believe the key to opening that door
p17
aVis great communication.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe desperately need great communication from our
p20
aVscientists and engineers in order to change the world.
p21
aVOur scientists and engineers are the ones
p22
aVthat are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy
p23
aVto environment to health care, among others,
p24
aVand if we don't know about it and understand it,
p25
aVthen the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility
p26
aVas non-scientists to have these interactions.
p27
aVBut these great conversations can't occur if our scientists
p28
aVand engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
p29
aVSo scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
p30
aa(lp31
VI want to share a few keys on how you can do that
p32
aVto make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
p33
aVand that your engineering is engaging.
p34
aVFirst question to answer for us: so what?
p35
aVTell us why your science is relevant to us.
p36
aVDon't just tell me that you study trabeculae,
p37
aVbut tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones
p38
aVbecause it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
p41
aVJargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
p42
aVSure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say
p43
aV"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?
p44
aVAnd making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
p45
aVInstead, as Einstein said, make everything
p46
aVas simple as possible, but no simpler.
p47
aVYou can clearly communicate your science
p48
aVwithout compromising the ideas.
p49
aVA few things to consider are having examples, stories
p50
aVand analogies. Those are ways to engage
p51
aVand excite us about your content.
p52
aVAnd when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
p53
aVHave you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)
p54
aVWhat do bullets do? Bullets kill,
p55
aVand they will kill your presentation.
p56
aVA slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much
p57
aVon the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
p58
aVInstead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is
p59
aVmuch more effective. It's showing that the special structure
p60
aVof trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired
p61
aVthe unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
p62
aVAnd the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence
p63
aVthat the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,
p64
aVand then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses
p65
aVand create a deeper sense of understanding
p66
aVof what's being described.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo I think these are just a few keys that can help
p69
aVthe rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland
p70
aVthat is science and engineering.
p71
aVAnd because the engineers that I've worked with have
p72
aVtaught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,
p73
aVI want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)
p74
aVTake your science, subtract your bullet points
p75
aVand your jargon, divide by relevance,
p76
aVmeaning share what's relevant to the audience,
p77
aVand multiply it by the passion that you have for
p78
aVthis incredible work that you're doing,
p79
aVand that is going to equal incredible interactions
p80
aVthat are full of understanding.
p81
aVAnd so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
p82
aVthis equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)
p83
aVThank you. (Applause)
