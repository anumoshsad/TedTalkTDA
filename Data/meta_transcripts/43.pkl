VHello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni
p4
aVfor the typographically hysterical amongst us.
p5
aVOne of the threads that seems to have come through
p6
aVloud and clear in the last couple of days
p7
aVis this need to reconcile what the Big wants \u2014
p8
aVthe "Big" being the organization, the system, the country \u2014
p9
aVand what the "Small" wants \u2014 the individual, the person.
p10
aVAnd how do you bring those two things together?
p11
aVCharlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately
p12
aVabout this need to bring consumers, to bring people
p13
aVinto the process of creating things.
p14
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today.
p15
aVSo, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,
p16
aVI think, is something that we believe in \u2014 something I believe in,
p17
aVand something that we kind of bring to life
p18
aVthrough what we do at Ideo.
p19
aa(lp20
VI call this first chapter \u2014 for the Brits in the room \u2014
p21
aVthe "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
p22
aVOften, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face
p23
aVthat you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,
p24
aVwhat we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,
p25
aV"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
p26
aVAnd rather than talk about it in the theory,
p27
aVI think I'm just going to show you an example.
p28
aVWe were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota
p29
aVto describe to them what their patient experience was.
p30
aVAnd I think they were expecting \u2014
p31
aVthey'd worked with lots of consultants before \u2014
p32
aVI think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart
p33
aVwith thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
p34
aVand all kinds of mappy stuff.
p35
aVOr even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing
p36
aVwith WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe first thing we actually shared with them was this.
p39
aVI'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
p40
aVThis is 59 seconds into the film.
p41
aVThis is a minute 59.
p42
aV3:19.
p43
aVI think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
p44
aV5:10.
p45
aV5:58.
p46
aV6:20.
p47
aVWe showed them the whole cut,
p48
aVand they were all completely, what is this?
p49
aVAnd the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,
p50
aVall you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
p51
aVAnd just putting yourself in the position of the patient \u2014
p52
aa(lp53
Vthis is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
p54
aVHe just lay in the hospital bed,
p55
aVand, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles
p56
aVfor a really long time.
p57
aVThat's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
p58
aVAnd they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
p59
aVOh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation
p60
aVfrom the point of view of the person out \u2014
p61
aVas opposed to the traditional position of the organization in \u2014
p62
aVwas, for these guys, quite a revelation.
p63
aVAnd so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
p64
aVSo they snapped into action.
p65
aVThey said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
p66
aVIt's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
p67
aVIt's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo we started with them prototyping some really little things
p70
aVthat we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
p71
aVThe first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
p72
aVand we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,
p73
aVso that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,
p74
aVyou could actually have a conversation with them.
p75
aVYou could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,
p76
aVso it created a tiny human interaction.
p77
aVVery small example of something that they could do.
p78
aVInterestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action \u2014
p79
aVsaid, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
p80
aVThe first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
p81
aVWhich I thought was really \u2014 I showed this to my mother recently.
p82
aVI think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
p83
aVIt's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
p84
aVNot particularly the world's best design solution
p85
aVfor those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
p86
aVbut nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
p87
aVThings that they started doing themselves \u2014
p88
aVlike changing the floor going into the patient's room
p89
aVso that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" \u2014
p90
aVwas a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo you went from public space to private space.
p93
aVAnd another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses \u2014 which I love \u2014
p94
aVwas they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,
p95
aVthen they put them on one wall of the patient's room,
p96
aVand they put this sticker there.
p97
aVSo that what you could actually do was go into the room
p98
aVand write messages to the person who was sick in that room,
p99
aVwhich was lovely.
p100
aVSo, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
p101
aVI thought that was a really, really nice example.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this is not particularly a new idea,
p104
aVkind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you
p105
aVand snapping and turning them into a solution.
p106
aVIt's a history of invention based around this.
p107
aVI'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
p108
aVJoan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter \u2014 came down on a Saturday morning,
p109
aVsaw her daughter watching the test card,
p110
aVwaiting for programs to come on one morning
p111
aVand from that came Sesame Street.
p112
aVMalcolm McLean was moving from one country to another
p113
aVand was wondering why it took these guys so long
p114
aVto get the boxes onto the ship.
p115
aVAnd he invented the shipping container.
p116
aVGeorge de Mestral \u2014 this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock \u2014
p117
aVwas walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,
p118
aVsort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw \u2014 this is a big British invention \u2014
p121
aVsaw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,
p122
aVwhen he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
p123
aVSo there's a whole series of just using your eyes,
p124
aVseeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh
p125
aVand using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
p126
aVSecond one, without sounding overly Zen,
p127
aVand this is a quote from the Buddha:
p128
aV"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,
p129
aVis often a really interesting place to start."
p130
aVBlinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
p131
aVSo, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,
p132
aVis a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
p133
aa(lp134
VAgain, another medical example here.
p135
aVWe were asked by a device producer \u2014
p136
aVwe did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
p137
aVWe did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo \u2014
p138
aVthey'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology
p139
aVfor medical diagnostics.
p140
aVThis was a device that a nurse uses
p141
aVwhen they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
p142
aVThey'll ask the nurses to input data.
p143
aVAnd they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away
p144
aVon this aluminum device
p145
aVand it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
p146
aVWhen we actually went and watched this procedure taking place \u2014
p147
aVand I'll explain this in a second \u2014
p148
aVit became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this
p149
aVthat they really weren't recognizing.
p150
aVWhen you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine \u2014
p151
aVwhich was the procedure that this device's data was about;
p152
aVit was for pain management \u2014 you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
p153
aVAnd so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,
p154
aVwas hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture \u2014
p155
aVwhich made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo, the thing that we designed, much less sexy
p158
aVbut much more human and practical, was this.
p159
aVSo, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,
p160
aVbut it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
p161
aVSo, again, going back to this \u2014 the idea that a tiny human gesture
p162
aVdictated the design of this product.
p163
aVAnd I think that's really, really important.
p164
aVSo, again, this idea of workarounds.
p165
aVWe use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,
p166
aVsort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED
p167
aVand just watching all of these kind of things happen
p168
aVwhile I've been here.
p169
aVThis idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life \u2014
p170
aVand the things we kind of do in our environment
p171
aVthat are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential \u2014
p172
aVis something that we look at a lot.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,
p175
aVcalled "Thoughtless Acts?"
p176
aVIt's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,
p177
aVwhich have huge intention and huge opportunity.
p178
aVWhy do we all follow the line in the street?
p179
aVThis is a picture in a Japanese subway.
p180
aVPeople consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
p181
aVWhy do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
p182
aVBecause we kind of have to \u2014 we're just compelled to.
p183
aVWe don't know why, but we do.
p184
aVWhy do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
p185
aVAgain, we're sort of using the world around us
p186
aVto create our own design solutions.
p187
aVAnd we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
p188
aVThis stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
p189
aVThis is people designing their own experiences.
p190
aVYou can draw from this.
p191
aVWe sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,
p192
aVthat it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
p193
aVIt's there for our use, on some level.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo, again, we sort of co-opt our environment
p196
aVto do all these different things.
p197
aVWe co-opt other experiences \u2014
p198
aVwe take one item and transfer it to another.
p199
aVAnd this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,
p200
aV"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
p201
aVBut, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
p202
aVSo somebody assumes
p203
aVthat because somebody else has done something,
p204
aVthat's permission for them to do the same thing.
p205
aVAnd there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
p206
aVI mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
p207
aVAnd we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
p208
aVWe all talk to one another in this highly visual way
p209
aVwithout realizing what we're doing.
p210
aVThird section is this idea of not knowing,
p211
aVof consciously putting yourself backwards.
p212
aVI talk about unthinking situations all the time.
p213
aVSort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean
p214
aVand looking at things afresh.
p215
aa(lp216
VA friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,
p217
aVand he was asked by his boss
p218
aVto help design a storage system for children.
p219
aVThis is the Billy bookcase \u2014 it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
p220
aVHammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,
p221
aVbecause they're impossible to assemble.
p222
aVBut big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
p223
aVThe reality is when you actually watch children,
p224
aVchildren don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
p225
aVChildren assume permission in a very different way.
p226
aVChildren live on things. They live under things.
p227
aVThey live around things,
p228
aVand so their spatial awareness relationship,
p229
aVand their thinking around storage is totally different.
p230
aVSo the first thing you have to do \u2014 this is Graham, the designer \u2014
p231
aVis, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is
p232
aVsitting under the table.
p233
aVSo, what came out of this?
p234
aVThis is the storage system that he designed.
p235
aVSo what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VIt's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
p240
aVSo, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
p241
aVIt's a completely empathic solution \u2014
p242
aVapart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VBut a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,
p247
aVand I think that's one of the things.
p248
aVAnd putting yourself in the position of the person,
p249
aVand I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again
p250
aVfrom this conference is how do we put ourselves
p251
aVin other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
p252
aVAnd then use that information to fuel solutions?
p253
aVAnd I think that's what this is very much about.
p254
aVLast section: green armband. We've all got them.
p255
aVIt's about this really.
p256
aVI mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter
p257
aVbut small enough to win.
p258
aVAgain, that's one of the themes
p259
aVthat I think has come through loud and clear in this conference
p260
aVis: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
p261
aVSo, again, we were asked to design a water pump
p262
aVfor a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
p263
aVThey're now called KickStart.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd, again, as designers,
p266
aVwe wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful
p267
aVand spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
p268
aVAnd that was completely irrelevant.
p269
aVWhen you put yourself in the position of these people,
p270
aVthings like the fact that this has to be able to fold up
p271
aVand fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant
p272
aVthan the form of it. The way it's produced,
p273
aVit has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods
p274
aVand indigenous materials.
p275
aVSo it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
p276
aVWe had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
p277
aVSo what seems like a very clunky product
p278
aVis, in fact, incredibly useful.
p279
aVIt's powered a bit like a Stairmaster \u2014 you pump up and down on it.
p280
aVChildren can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
p281
aVIt's turning these guys \u2014 again, one of the themes \u2014
p282
aVit's turning them into entrepreneurs.
p283
aa(lp284
VThese guys are using this very successfully.
p285
aVAnd for us, it's been great
p286
aVbecause it's won loads of design awards.
p287
aVSo we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,
p288
aVthe needs of the individuals in the company,
p289
aVto feel good about a product we were actually designing,
p290
aVand the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
p291
aVThere it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
p292
aVSo as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets
p293
aVto all of you this morning.
p294
aVWe've made a donation on everybody's behalf here
p295
aVto kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
p296
aVBecause, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
p297
aVWe feel that this is an important gesture.
p298
aVSo we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
p299
aVI hope you'll all wear them.
p300
aVSo that's it. Thank you.
