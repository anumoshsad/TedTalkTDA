VMaya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon,
p28
aVand I've been making animated flip books
p29
aVsince I was three years old.
p30
aVAt that age, I also learned about what an animator was.
p31
aVThere was a program on TV about jobs
p32
aVmost kids don't know about.
p33
aVWhen I understood that an animator
p34
aVmakes the cartoons I saw on TV,
p35
aVI immediately said, "That's what I want to be."
p36
aVI don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,
p37
aVbut that was a greatly defining moment in my life.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnimation and art has always been my first love.
p40
aVIt was my love for technology that sparked the idea
p41
aVfor "Malicious Dishes."
p42
aVThere was a virus on my computer,
p43
aVand I was trying to get rid of it,
p44
aVand all of a sudden, I just thought,
p45
aVwhat if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?
p46
aVMaybe a restaurant where they meet up
p47
aVand do virusy things?
p48
aVAnd thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.
p49
aa(lp50
VAt four years old, my dad showed me
p51
aVhow to take apart a computer and put it back together again.
p52
aVThat started my love for technology.
p53
aVI built my first website myself in HTML,
p54
aVand I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
p55
aa(lp56
VI'm also working on an animated series
p57
aVcalled "The Pollinators."
p58
aVIt's about bees and other pollinators in our environment
p59
aVand why they're so important.
p60
aVIf plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,
p61
aVthen all creatures, including ourselves,
p62
aVthat depend on these plants, would starve.
p63
aVSo I decided to take these cool creatures
p64
aVand make a superhero team.
p65
aV(Applause)
p66
aV(Foot stomp)
p67
aV(Music)
p68
aV(Roar)
p69
aVPollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!
p70
aVI need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
p71
aV(Music)
p72
aa(lp73
VThank you. (Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VAll of my animations start with ideas,
p76
aVbut what are ideas?
p77
aVIdeas can spark a movement.
p78
aVIdeas are opportunities and innovation.
p79
aVIdeas truly are what make the world go round.
p80
aVIf it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be
p81
aVwhere we are now with technology, medicine,
p82
aVart, culture, and how we even live our lives.
p83
aVAt eight years old, I took my ideas
p84
aVand started my own business called Maya's Ideas,
p85
aVand my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
p88
aVI'm 13 now, and although I started my business
p89
aVin 2008,
p90
aVmy artistic journey started way before then.
p91
aVI was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to
p92
aVincorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
p93
aVI would find different fabrics around the house,
p94
aVand say, "This could be a scarf or a hat,"
p95
aVand I had all these ideas for designs.
p96
aVI noticed when I wore my creations,
p97
aVpeople would stop me and say,
p98
aV"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"
p99
aVAnd I thought, I can start my own business.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow I didn't have any business plans
p102
aVat only eight years old.
p103
aVI only knew I wanted to make pretty creations
p104
aVthat were safe for the environment
p105
aVand I wanted to give back.
p106
aVMy mom taught me how to sew,
p107
aVand on my back porch, I would sit and make
p108
aVlittle headbands out of ribbon,
p109
aVand I would write down the names and the price of each item.
p110
aVI started making more items like hats,
p111
aVscarves and bags.
p112
aVSoon, my items began selling all over the world,
p113
aVand I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,
p114
aVCanada and more.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, I had a lot to learn about my business,
p117
aVlike branding and marketing,
p118
aVstaying engaged with my customers,
p119
aVand seeing what sold the most and the least.
p120
aVSoon, my business really started to take off.
p121
aVThen one day, Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was 10 years old.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVThey wanted to feature me and my company
p124
aVin their article.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow a lot of people ask me,
p127
aVwhy is your business eco-friendly?
p128
aVI've had a passion for protecting the environment
p129
aVand its creatures since I was little.
p130
aVMy parents taught me at an early age
p131
aVabout giving back and being a good steward to the environment.
p132
aVI heard about how the dyes in some clothing
p133
aVor the process of even making the items
p134
aVwas harmful to the people and the planet,
p135
aVso I started doing my own research,
p136
aVand I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed,
p137
aVthere is a waste issue that gives a negative impact
p138
aVon the environment.
p139
aVFor example, the grinding of materials,
p140
aVor the dumping of dried powder materials.
p141
aVThese actions can pollute the air,
p142
aVmaking it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
p143
aVSo when I started my business,
p144
aVI knew two things:
p145
aVAll of my items had to be eco-friendly,
p146
aVand 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made
p147
aVwent to local and global charities
p148
aVand environmental organizations.
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVI feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs
p151
aVthat not only seeks to have a successful business,
p152
aVbut also a sustainable future.
p153
aVI feel that I can meet the needs of my customers
p154
aVwithout compromising the ability of future generations
p155
aVto live in a greener tomorrow.
p156
aa(lp157
VWe live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,
p158
aVand that makes me even more passionate to save it.
p159
aVBut it's never enough to just to get it through your heads
p160
aVabout the things that are happening in our world.
p161
aVIt takes to get it through your hearts,
p162
aVbecause when you get it through your heart,
p163
aVthat is when movements are sparked.
p164
aVThat is when opportunities
p165
aVand innovation are created,
p166
aVand that is why ideas come to life.
p167
aa(lp168
VThank you, and peace and blessings.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VThank you. (Applause)

VPat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about
p175
aVthe amazing parents who are behind
p176
aVthis incredible woman. Where are they?
