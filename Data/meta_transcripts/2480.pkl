VI have one more reason for optimism:
p4
aVclimate change.
p5
aVMaybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact.
p6
aa(lp7
VOn December 12, 2015,
p8
aVin Paris, under the United Nations,
p9
aV195 governments got together
p10
aVand unanimously \u2014
p11
aVif you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is \u2014
p12
aVunanimously decided
p13
aVto intentionally change the course of the global economy
p14
aVin order to protect the most vulnerable
p15
aVand improve the life of all of us.
p16
aVNow, that is a remarkable achievement.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VBut it is even more remarkable
p21
aVif you consider where we had been just a few years ago.
p22
aV2009, Copenhagen.
p23
aVWho remembers Copenhagen?
p24
aVWell, after years of working toward a climate agreement,
p25
aVthe same governments convened in Copenhagen
p26
aVand failed miserably.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhy did it fail miserably?
p29
aVFor many different reasons,
p30
aVbut primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide
p31
aVbetween the global North and the global South.
p32
aVSo now, six months after this failure,
p33
aVI was called in to assume the responsibility
p34
aVof the global climate change negotiations.
p35
aVYou can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job.
p36
aVThe global mood on climate change was in the trash can.
p37
aVNo one believed
p38
aVthat a global agreement could ever be possible.
p39
aVIn fact, neither did I.
p40
aVIf you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience,
p41
aVI'm going to divulge a secret
p42
aVthat has been gratefully buried by history.
p43
aVOn my first press conference,
p44
aVa journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,
p45
aVdo you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?"
p46
aVAnd without engaging brain, I heard me utter,
p47
aV"Not in my lifetime."
p48
aVWell, you can imagine the faces of my press team
p49
aVwho were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman
p50
aVwho was their new boss.
p51
aVAnd I was horrified, too.
p52
aVNow, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself.
p53
aVI was actually horrified
p54
aVat the consequences of what I had just said,
p55
aVat the consequences for the world
p56
aVin which all our children are going to have to live.
p57
aVIt was frankly a horrible moment for me,
p58
aVand I thought, well, no, hang on,
p59
aVhang on.
p60
aVImpossible is not a fact,
p61
aVit's an attitude.
p62
aVIt's only an attitude.
p63
aVAnd I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude
p64
aVand I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I don't know \u2014
p67
aVNo, just this? Thanks.
p68
aVI don't know \u2014
p69
aVwhat you would do
p70
aVif you were told your job is to save the planet.
p71
aVPut that on the job description.
p72
aVAnd you have full responsibility,
p73
aVbut you have absolutely no authority,
p74
aVbecause governments are sovereign in every decision that they take.
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, I would really love to know
p77
aVwhat you would do on the first Monday morning,
p78
aVbut here's what I did: I panicked.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd then I panicked again,
p83
aVbecause I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem.
p84
aVAnd then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem,
p85
aVbut I do know one thing:
p86
aVwe have got to change the tone of this conversation.
p87
aVBecause there is no way you can deliver victory
p88
aVwithout optimism.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd here,
p91
aVI use optimism as a very simple word,
p92
aVbut let's understand it in its broader sense.
p93
aVLet's understand it as courage,
p94
aVhope, trust, solidarity,
p95
aVthe fundamental belief that we humans can come together
p96
aVand can help each other to better the fate of mankind.
p97
aVWell, you can imagine that I thought that without that,
p98
aVthere was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.
p99
aVAnd for six years,
p100
aVI have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system,
p101
aVno matter what the questions from the press \u2014
p102
aVand I have gotten better at those \u2014
p103
aVand no matter what the evidence to the contrary.
p104
aVAnd believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence.
p105
aVBut relentless optimism into the system.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd pretty soon,
p108
aVwe began to see changes happening in many areas,
p109
aVprecipitated by thousands of people,
p110
aVincluding many of you here today,
p111
aVand I thank you.
p112
aVAnd this TED community will not be surprised
p113
aVif I tell you the first area
p114
aVin which we saw remarkable change
p115
aVwas ...
p116
aVtechnology.
p117
aVWe began to see that clean technologies,
p118
aVin particular renewable energy technologies,
p119
aVbegan to drop price and increase in capacity,
p120
aVto the point where today we are already building
p121
aVconcentrated solar power plants
p122
aVthat have the capacity to power entire cities,
p123
aVto say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility
p124
aVand intelligent buildings.
p125
aVAnd with this shift in technologies,
p126
aVwe were able to begin to understand
p127
aVthat there was a shift in the economic equation,
p128
aVbecause we were able to recognize
p129
aVthat yes, there are huge costs to climate change,
p130
aVand yes, there are compounded risks.
p131
aVBut there also are economic advantages
p132
aVand intrinsic benefits,
p133
aVbecause the dissemination of the clean technologies
p134
aVis going to bring us cleaner air,
p135
aVbetter health,
p136
aVbetter transportation, more livable cities,
p137
aVmore energy security,
p138
aVmore energy access to the developing world.
p139
aVIn sum, a better world than what we have now.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd with that understanding,
p142
aVyou should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were,
p143
aVthe spread of ingenuity and excitement
p144
aVthat went through, first through nonnational governments,
p145
aVthe private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies,
p146
aVinvestors, city leaders, faith communities,
p147
aVbecause they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest.
p148
aVThis can actually improve their bottom line.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd it wasn't just the usual suspects.
p151
aVI have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company
p152
aVcome to me at the beginning of last year
p153
aVand say \u2014
p154
aVprivately, of course \u2014
p155
aVhe did not know how he was going to change his company,
p156
aVbut he is going to change it,
p157
aVbecause he's interested in long-term viability.
p158
aVWell, now we have a shift in the economic equation,
p159
aVand with that, with broader support from everyone,
p160
aVit did not take very long before we saw that national governments
p161
aVwoke up to the fact that this is in their national interest.
p162
aVAnd when we asked countries to begin to identify
p163
aVhow they could contribute to global efforts
p164
aVbut based on their national interest,
p165
aV189 countries out of 195,
p166
aV189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans,
p167
aVbased on their national interest,
p168
aVconcurrent with their priorities,
p169
aVconsistent with their national sustainable development plans.
p170
aa(lp171
VWell,
p172
aVonce you protect the core interests of nations,
p173
aVthen you can understand that nations were ready
p174
aVto begin to converge onto a common path,
p175
aVonto a common direction of travel
p176
aVthat is going to take us probably several decades,
p177
aVbut over those several decades is going to take us
p178
aVinto the new economy,
p179
aVinto a decarbonized, highly resilient economy,
p180
aVAnd the national contributions that are currently on the table
p181
aVon behalf of national governments
p182
aVare insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate,
p183
aVbut they are only the first step,
p184
aVand they will improve over time.
p185
aVAnd the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts
p186
aVis legally binding.
p187
aVAnd the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years
p188
aVto assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding,
p189
aVand the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy
p190
aVis legally binding.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd here's the more important part:
p193
aVWhat did we have before?
p194
aVA very small handful of countries
p195
aVwho had undertaken very reduced,
p196
aVshort-term emission reduction commitments
p197
aVthat were completely insufficient
p198
aVand furthermore, largely perceived as a burden.
p199
aVNow what do we have?
p200
aVNow we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities
p201
aVfrom different approaches in different sectors,
p202
aVbut all of them contributing to a common goal
p203
aVand along a path
p204
aVwith environmental integrity.
p205
aVWell, once you have all of this in place
p206
aVand you have shifted this understanding,
p207
aVthen you see that governments were able to go to Paris
p208
aVand adopt the Paris agreement.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VSo,
p213
aVas I look back
p214
aVover the past six years,
p215
aVfirst I remember
p216
aVthe day the Paris agreement was adopted.
p217
aVI cannot tell you the euphoria in the room.
p218
aV5,000 people jumping out of their seats,
p219
aVcrying, clapping, screaming, yelling,
p220
aVtorn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen,
p221
aVbecause so many people
p222
aVhad worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd it wasn't just those who had participated directly.
p225
aVA few weeks ago, I was with a colleague
p226
aVwho was trying to decide
p227
aVon a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.
p228
aVAnd once he had finally decided what he was going to buy,
p229
aVthe jeweler said to him,
p230
aV"You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now,
p231
aVbecause these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change."
p232
aV"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,
p233
aVthe governments have just come to a decision,
p234
aVand Tahiti could have a chance."
p235
aVWell, what a fantastic confirmation
p236
aVthat perhaps, perhaps here is hope,
p237
aVhere is a possible chance.
p238
aVI'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do.
p239
aVWe've only just started our work on climate change.
p240
aVAnd in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts
p241
aVover the next five years that are the urgent five years.
p242
aVBut I do believe
p243
aVthat we have come over the past six years
p244
aVfrom the impossible
p245
aVto the now unstoppable.
p246
aVAnd how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism
p247
aVthat allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration,
p248
aVthat allowed us to understand that national and local interests
p249
aVare not necessarily at odds with global needs,
p250
aVand that if we understand that, we can bring them together
p251
aVand we can merge them harmoniously.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd as I look forward to other global issues
p254
aVthat will require our attention this century \u2014
p255
aVfood security, water security, home security, forced migration \u2014
p256
aVI see that we certainly do not know
p257
aVhow we are going to solve those problems yet.
p258
aVBut we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change
p259
aVand we can understand
p260
aVthat we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality.
p261
aVBecause we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers,
p262
aVand that your loss is my gain.
p263
aVWell, now that we're in a world
p264
aVin which we have reached planetary boundaries
p265
aVand that we are not just so interconnected,
p266
aVbut increasingly interdependent on each other,
p267
aVyour loss is no longer my gain.
p268
aVWe're either all losers
p269
aVor we all can be winners.
p270
aVBut we are going to have to decide
p271
aVbetween zero and sum.
p272
aVWe're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all
p273
aVor living life as the sum of all of us.
p274
aVWe've done it once. We can do it again.
p275
