VI'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.
p4
aVThese are spinneret glands
p5
aVon the abdomen of a spider.
p6
aVThey produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,
p7
aVtougher than any fiber humans have ever made.
p8
aVThe nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.
p9
aVAnd to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,
p10
aVextremes of pressure and loads of pollution.
p11
aVAnd yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure
p12
aVwith raw materials of dead flies and water.
p13
aVIt does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.
p14
aVThis beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.
p15
aVThat's roughly 10,000 times the range
p16
aVof man-made fire detectors.
p17
aVAnd what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire
p18
aVconnected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.
p21
aVIf we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,
p22
aVwe could achieve factor 10, factor 100,
p23
aVmaybe even factor 1,000 savings
p24
aVin resource and energy use.
p25
aVAnd if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,
p26
aVI believe there are three really big changes
p27
aVwe need to bring about.
p28
aVFirstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.
p29
aVSecondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,
p30
aVpolluting way of using resources
p31
aVto a closed-loop model.
p32
aVAnd thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy
p33
aVto a solar economy.
p34
aVAnd for all three of these, I believe,
p35
aVbiomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.
p36
aa(lp37
VYou could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,
p38
aVand all of those have benefited
p39
aVfrom a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.
p40
aVAnd given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.
p41
aVSo I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.
p42
aVAnd let's start with radical increases
p43
aVin resource efficiency.
p44
aVWhen we were working on the Eden Project,
p45
aVwe had to create a very large greenhouse
p46
aVin a site that was not only irregular,
p47
aVbut it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.
p48
aVIt was a hell of a challenge,
p49
aVand it was actually examples from biology
p50
aVthat provided a lot of the clues.
p51
aVSo for instance,
p52
aVit was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form
p53
aVthat would work regardless of the final ground levels.
p54
aVStudying pollen grains
p55
aVand radiolaria and carbon molecules
p56
aVhelped us devise the most efficient structural solution
p57
aVusing hexagons and pentagons.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe next move was that we wanted
p60
aVto try and maximize the size of those hexagons.
p61
aVAnd to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,
p62
aVwhich is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.
p63
aVAnd in nature there are lots of examples
p64
aVof very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.
p65
aVSo we started exploring this material called ETFE.
p66
aVIt's a high-strength polymer.
p67
aVAnd what you do is you put it together in three layers,
p68
aVyou weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.
p69
aVAnd the great thing about this stuff
p70
aVis you can make it in units
p71
aVof roughly seven times the size of glass,
p72
aVand it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.
p73
aVSo that was a factor-100 saving.
p74
aVAnd what we found is that we got into a positive cycle
p75
aVin which one breakthrough facilitated another.
p76
aVSo with such large, lightweight pillows,
p77
aVwe had much less steel.
p78
aVWith less steel we were getting more sunlight in,
p79
aVwhich meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.
p80
aVAnd with less overall weight in the superstructure,
p81
aVthere were big savings in the foundations.
p82
aVAnd at the end of the project we worked out
p83
aVthat the weight of that superstructure
p84
aVwas actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example
p87
aVof how ideas from biology
p88
aVcan lead to radical increases in resource efficiency \u2014
p89
aVdelivering the same function,
p90
aVbut with a fraction of the resource input.
p91
aVAnd actually there are loads of examples in nature
p92
aVthat you could turn to for similar solutions.
p93
aVSo for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures
p94
aVbased on giant Amazon water lilies,
p95
aVwhole buildings inspired by abalone shells,
p96
aVsuper-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.
p97
aVThere's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here
p98
aVusing nature as a design tool.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.
p101
aVThe way we tend to use resources
p102
aVis we extract them,
p103
aVwe turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.
p104
aVNature works very differently.
p105
aVIn ecosystems, the waste from one organism
p106
aVbecomes the nutrient for something else in that system.
p107
aVAnd there are some examples of projects
p108
aVthat have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.
p109
aVAnd one of my favorites
p110
aVis called the Cardboard to Caviar Project
p111
aVby Graham Wiles.
p112
aVAnd in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants
p113
aVthat were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.
p114
aVIt was ending up in landfills.
p115
aVNow the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.
p116
aVAnd I'm just going to talk through this animation.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
p119
aVThey then shredded the cardboard
p120
aVand sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
p121
aVWhen that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
p122
aVThey put it into worm recomposting systems,
p123
aVwhich produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,
p124
aVwhich produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.
p125
aVSo it transformed a linear process
p126
aVinto a closed-loop model,
p127
aVand it created more value in the process.
p128
aVGraham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,
p129
aVturning waste streams into schemes that create value.
p130
aVAnd just as natural systems
p131
aVtend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,
p132
aVthere's a real sense with this project
p133
aVthat the number of possibilities
p134
aVjust continue increasing.
p135
aVAnd I know it's a quirky example,
p136
aVbut I think the implications of this are quite radical,
p137
aVbecause it suggests that we could actually
p138
aVtransform a big problem \u2014 waste \u2014 into a massive opportunity.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd particularly in cities \u2014
p141
aVwe could look at the whole metabolism of cities,
p142
aVand look at those as opportunities.
p143
aVAnd that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,
p144
aVthe Mobius Project,
p145
aVwhere we're trying to bring together a number of activities,
p146
aVall within one building,
p147
aVso that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.
p148
aVAnd the kind of elements I'm talking about
p149
aVare, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,
p150
aVa bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.
p151
aVThen we would have an anaerobic digester,
p152
aVwhich could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,
p153
aVturn that into heat for the greenhouse
p154
aVand electricity to feed back into the grid.
p155
aVWe'd have a water treatment system
p156
aVtreating wastewater, turning that into fresh water
p157
aVand generating energy from the solids
p158
aVusing just plants and micro-organisms.
p159
aVWe'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen
p160
aVand worms from the compost
p161
aVand supplying fish back to the restaurant.
p162
aVAnd we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that
p163
aVcould be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo you can see that we're bringing together
p166
aVcycles of food, energy and water and waste
p167
aVall within one building.
p168
aVAnd just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,
p169
aVwhich at the moment is a complete eyesore.
p170
aVSome of you may recognize this.
p171
aVAnd with just a little bit of planning,
p172
aVwe could transform a space dominated by traffic
p173
aVinto one that provides open space for people,
p174
aVreconnects people with food
p175
aVand transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo the final project I want to talk about
p178
aVis the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.
p179
aVIt may come as a surprise to some of you
p180
aVto hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert
p181
aVwere actually forested a fairly short time ago.
p182
aVSo for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,
p183
aVhuge areas of North Africa
p184
aVwere covered in cedar and cypress forests.
p185
aVAnd during the evolution of life on the Earth,
p186
aVit was the colonization
p187
aVof the land by plants
p188
aVthat helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.
p189
aVThe converse is also true.
p190
aVThe more vegetation we lose,
p191
aVthe more that's likely to exacerbate climate change
p192
aVand lead to further desertification.
p193
aVAnd this animation,
p194
aVthis shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,
p195
aVand what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts
p196
aVshift quite a lot,
p197
aVand that raises the question
p198
aVof whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions
p199
aVto halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd if you look at some of the organisms
p202
aVthat have evolved to live in deserts,
p203
aVthere are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.
p204
aVThis is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,
p205
aVand it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.
p206
aVThe way it does this is it comes out at night,
p207
aVcrawls to the top of a sand dune,
p208
aVand because it's got a matte black shell,
p209
aVis able to radiate heat out to the night sky
p210
aVand become slightly cooler than its surroundings.
p211
aVSo when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,
p212
aVyou get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.
p213
aVJust before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,
p214
aVhas a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.
p215
aVAnd the ingenuity, if you could call it that,
p216
aVgoes even further.
p217
aVBecause if you look closely at the beetle's shell,
p218
aVthere are lots of little bumps on that shell.
p219
aVAnd those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.
p220
aVBetween them there's a waxy finish which repels water.
p221
aVAnd the effect of this is that
p222
aVas the droplets start to form on the bumps,
p223
aVthey stay in tight, spherical beads,
p224
aVwhich means they're much more mobile
p225
aVthan they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.
p226
aVSo even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,
p227
aVit's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
p228
aVSo amazing example of an adaptation
p229
aVto a very resource-constrained environment \u2014
p230
aVand in that sense, very relevant
p231
aVto the kind of challenges we're going to be facing
p232
aVover the next few years, next few decades.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.
p235
aVThis is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,
p236
aVand the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,
p237
aVand you trickle seawater over that
p238
aVso that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture
p239
aVand is cooled in the process.
p240
aVSo inside it's cool and humid,
p241
aVwhich means the plants need less water to grow.
p242
aVAnd then at the back of the greenhouse,
p243
aVit condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater
p244
aVin a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.
p245
aVAnd what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built
p246
aVwas it was producing slightly more freshwater
p247
aVthan it needed for the plants inside.
p248
aVSo they just started spreading this on the land around,
p249
aVand the combination of that and the elevated humidity
p250
aVhad quite a dramatic effect on the local area.
p251
aVThis photograph was taken on completion day,
p252
aVand just one year later, it looked like that.
p253
aVSo it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building
p254
aVturning barren land back into biologically productive land \u2014
p255
aVand in that sense, going beyond sustainable design
p256
aVto achieve restorative design.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo we were keen to scale this up
p259
aVand apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.
p260
aVAnd when you think about nature,
p261
aVoften you think about it as being all about competition.
p262
aVBut actually in mature ecosystems,
p263
aVyou're just as likely to find examples
p264
aVof symbiotic relationships.
p265
aVSo an important biomimicry principle
p266
aVis to find ways of bringing technologies together
p267
aVin symbiotic clusters.
p268
aVAnd the technology that we settled on
p269
aVas an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse
p270
aVis concentrated solar power,
p271
aVwhich uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat
p272
aVto create electricity.
p273
aVAnd just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,
p274
aVconsider that we receive
p275
aV10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year
p276
aVas we use in energy from all forms \u2014
p277
aV10,000 times.
p278
aVSo our energy problems are not intractable.
p279
aVIt's a challenge to our ingenuity.
p280
aVAnd the kind of synergies I'm talking about
p281
aVare, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.
p282
aVCSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.
p283
aVThat's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.
p284
aVCSP produces a lot of waste heat.
p285
aVWe'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater
p286
aVand enhance the restorative benefits.
p287
aVAnd finally, in the shade under the mirrors,
p288
aVit's possible to grow all sorts of crops
p289
aVthat would not grow in direct sunlight.
p290
aVSo this is how this scheme would look.
p291
aVThe idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.
p292
aVWe'd have concentrated solar power plants
p293
aVat intervals along the way.
p294
aa(lp295
VSome of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.
p296
aVAnd with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,
p297
aVyou don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?"
p298
aVYou think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"
p299
aVAnd it turns out
p300
aVthat different things crystallize out at different stages.
p301
aVWhen you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out
p302
aVis calcium carbonate.
p303
aVAnd that builds up on the evaporators \u2014
p304
aVand that's what that image on the left is \u2014
p305
aVgradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.
p306
aVSo after a while, we could take that out,
p307
aVuse it as a lightweight building block.
p308
aVAnd if you think about the carbon in that,
p309
aVthat would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea
p310
aVand then locked away in a building product.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe next thing is sodium chloride.
p313
aVYou can also compress that into a building block,
p314
aVas they did here.
p315
aVThis is a hotel in Bolivia.
p316
aVAnd then after that, there are all sorts
p317
aVof compounds and elements that we can extract,
p318
aVlike phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.
p319
aVAnd there's just about every element of the periodic table
p320
aVin seawater.
p321
aVSo it should be possible to extract valuable elements
p322
aVlike lithium for high-performance batteries.
p323
aVAnd in parts of the Arabian Gulf,
p324
aVthe seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily
p325
aVdue to the discharge of waste brine
p326
aVfrom desalination plants.
p327
aVAnd it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.
p328
aVNow we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.
p329
aVWe could evaporate it
p330
aVto enhance the restorative benefits
p331
aVand capture the salts,
p332
aVtransforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.
p333
aVReally the Sahara Forest Project is a model
p334
aVfor how we could create zero-carbon food,
p335
aVabundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet
p336
aVas well as reversing desertification in certain areas.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:
p339
aVradical increases in resource efficiency,
p340
aVclosing loops and a solar economy.
p341
aVThey're not just possible; they're critical.
p342
aVAnd I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems
p343
aVwill provide a lot of the solutions.
p344
aVBut perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides
p345
aVis a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.
p346
aVFar too much of the talk about the environment
p347
aVuses very negative language.
p348
aVBut here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.
p349
aVAnd this is an important point.
p350
aa(lp351
VAntoine de Saint-Exupery once said,
p352
aV"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,
p353
aVyou don't sit around talking about carpentry.
p354
aVNo, you need to set people's souls ablaze
p355
aVwith visions of exploring distant shores."
p356
aVAnd that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,
p357
aVand let's make progress with what could be
p358
aVthe most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.
