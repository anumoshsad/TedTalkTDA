VI was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.
p4
aVI couldn't understand
p5
aVthe starvation, the destruction,
p6
aVthe killing of innocent people.
p7
aVMaking sense of those things
p8
aVis a very difficult thing to do.
p9
aVAnd when I was 12, I became an actor.
p10
aVI was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.
p11
aVI was told I was dyslexic.
p12
aVIn fact, I have got qualifications.
p13
aVI got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get \u2014
p14
aVwhich was useful, obviously.
p15
aVAnd so concern
p16
aVis where all of this comes from.
p17
aVAnd then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things,
p18
aVand I felt the content of the work that I was involved in
p19
aVreally wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby,
p22
aVthis wonderful nuclear physicist,
p23
aVand he said that media had a responsibility,
p24
aVthat all sectors of society had a responsibility
p25
aVto try and progress things and move things forward.
p26
aVAnd that fascinated me,
p27
aVbecause I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.
p28
aVAnd then I thought, well maybe I could do something.
p29
aVMaybe I could become a filmmaker.
p30
aVMaybe I can use the form of film constructively
p31
aVto in some way make a difference.
p32
aVMaybe there's a little change I can get involved in.
p33
aVSo I started thinking about peace,
p34
aVand I was obviously, as I said to you,
p35
aVvery much moved by these images,
p36
aVtrying to make sense of that.
p37
aVCould I go and speak to older and wiser people
p38
aVwho would tell me how they made sense
p39
aVof the things that are going on?
p40
aVBecause it's obviously incredibly frightening.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut I realized that,
p43
aVhaving been messing around with structure as an actor,
p44
aVthat a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough,
p45
aVthat there needed to be a mountain to climb,
p46
aVthere needed to be a journey that I had to take.
p47
aVAnd if I took that journey,
p48
aVno matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.
p49
aVThe point was that I would have something
p50
aVto hook the questions of \u2014 is humankind fundamentally evil?
p51
aVIs the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?
p52
aVIs that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I was thinking about peace,
p55
aVand then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?
p56
aVAnd that was when I had the idea.
p57
aVThere was no starting point for peace.
p58
aVThere was no day of global unity.
p59
aVThere was no day of intercultural cooperation.
p60
aVThere was no day when humanity came together,
p61
aVseparate in all of those things
p62
aVand just shared it together \u2014
p63
aVthat we're in this together,
p64
aVand that if we united and we interculturally cooperated,
p65
aVthen that might be the key to humanity's survival.
p66
aVThat might shift the level of consciousness
p67
aVaround the fundamental issues that humanity faces \u2014
p68
aVif we did it just for a day.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo obviously we didn't have any money.
p71
aVI was living at my mom's place.
p72
aVAnd we started writing letters to everybody.
p73
aVYou very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do
p74
aVto fathom that out.
p75
aVHow do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world
p76
aVto create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,
p77
aVthe 21st of September?
p78
aVAnd I wanted it to be the 21st of September
p79
aVbecause it was my granddad's favorite number.
p80
aVHe was a prisoner of war.
p81
aVHe saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
p82
aVIt poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.
p83
aVSo he was like my hero.
p84
aVAnd the reason why 21 was the number is
p85
aV700 men left, 23 came back,
p86
aVtwo died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.
p87
aVAnd that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo we began this journey,
p90
aVand we launched it in 1999.
p91
aVAnd we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors,
p92
aVNobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths,
p93
aVvarious organizations \u2014 literally wrote to everybody.
p94
aVAnd very quickly, some letters started coming back.
p95
aVAnd we started to build this case.
p96
aVAnd I remember the first letter.
p97
aVOne of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.
p98
aVAnd of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars
p99
aVand getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].
p100
aVA letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying,
p101
aV"This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.
p102
aVI'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."
p103
aVAnd we didn't have money for the flight.
p104
aVAnd I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time,
p105
aVand said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.
p106
aVCould you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."
p107
aVAnd of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.
p108
aVAnd then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd actually, let me go back to that slide,
p111
aVbecause when we launched it in 1999 \u2014
p112
aVthis idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence \u2014
p113
aVwe invited thousands of people.
p114
aVWell not thousands \u2014 hundreds of people, lots of people \u2014
p115
aVall the press, because we were going to try and create
p116
aVthe first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.
p117
aVAnd we invited everybody,
p118
aVand no press showed up.
p119
aVThere were 114 people there \u2014 they were mostly my friends and family.
p120
aVAnd that was kind of like the launch of this thing.
p121
aVBut it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.
p122
aVFor me, it was really about the process.
p123
aVIt wasn't about the end result.
p124
aVAnd that's the beautiful thing about the camera.
p125
aVThey used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.
p126
aVAnd just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing
p127
aVand really empowering actually.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo anyway, we began the journey.
p130
aVAnd here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.
p131
aVI'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long,
p132
aVbecause every time I saw Kofi Annan,
p133
aVI was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it,
p134
aVand that was kind of what was going on.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVYeah, I'm not worried about it now.
p137
aVSo Mary Robinson,
p138
aVshe said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created."
p139
aVKofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."
p140
aVThe OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim,
p141
aVsaid, "I must get the African countries involved."
p142
aVDr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate,
p143
aVpresident now of Costa Rica,
p144
aVsaid, "I'll do everything that I can."
p145
aVSo I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.
p146
aVI met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks,
p147
aVand so on and so on and so on \u2014
p148
aVwhile I was building the case
p149
aVto prove whether this idea
p150
aVwould make sense.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.
p153
aV76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.
p154
aVAnd I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.
p155
aVI've recorded 44,000 young people.
p156
aVI've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.
p157
aVI'm really clear about how young people feel
p158
aVwhen you talk to them about this idea
p159
aVof having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world
p160
aVthrough their poetry, their art, their literature,
p161
aVtheir music, their sport, whatever it might be.
p162
aVAnd we were listening to everybody.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.
p165
aVand working with NGOs and building this case.
p166
aVI felt that I was presenting a case
p167
aVon behalf of the global community
p168
aVto try and create this day.
p169
aVAnd the stronger the case and the more detailed it was,
p170
aVthe better chance we had of creating this day.
p171
aVAnd it was this stuff, this,
p172
aVwhere I actually was in the beginning
p173
aVkind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.
p174
aVIt didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.
p175
aVThe fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work,
p176
aVthen I could make a statement
p177
aVabout how unwilling the global community is to unite \u2014
p178
aVuntil, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.
p179
aVAnd this young child
p180
aVwho'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic,
p181
aVand that young boy who was a child soldier,
p182
aVwho told me he'd killed people \u2014 he was about 12 \u2014
p183
aVthese things made me realize
p184
aVthat this was not a film that I could just stop.
p185
aVAnd that actually, at that moment something happened to me,
p186
aVwhich obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.
p187
aVIf this is the only film that I ever make,
p188
aVI'm going to document until this becomes a reality."
p189
aVBecause we've got to stop, we've got to do something
p190
aVwhere we unite \u2014
p191
aVseparate from all the politics and religion
p192
aVthat, as a young person, is confusing me.
p193
aVI don't know how to get involved in that process.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.
p196
aVThe Costa Rican government and the British government
p197
aVhad put forward to the United Nations General Assembly,
p198
aVwith 54 co-sponsors,
p199
aVthe idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,
p200
aVthe 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date,
p201
aVand it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aVYeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.
p204
aVAnd thank you to all of them.
p205
aVThat was an incredible moment.
p206
aVI was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.
p207
aVAnd as I mentioned, when it started,
p208
aVwe were at the Globe, and there was no press.
p209
aVAnd now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."
p210
aVAnd suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.
p211
aa(lp212
VKofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th
p213
aVto do a press conference.
p214
aVAnd it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
p215
aVAnd I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.
p216
aVAnd obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.
p217
aVThe world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.
p218
aVAnd it was obviously a tragic moment
p219
aVfor the thousands of people who lost their lives,
p220
aVthere and then subsequently all over the world.
p221
aVIt never happened.
p222
aVAnd I remember thinking,
p223
aV"This is exactly why, actually,
p224
aVwe have to work even harder.
p225
aVAnd we have to make this day work.
p226
aVIt's been created; nobody knows.
p227
aVBut we have to continue this journey,
p228
aVand we have to tell people,
p229
aVand we have to prove it can work."
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd I left New York freaked,
p232
aVbut actually empowered.
p233
aVAnd I felt inspired
p234
aVby the possibilities
p235
aVthat if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.
p236
aVI remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
p237
aVI was showing the film,
p238
aVand I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered
p239
aVby some guys having watched the film \u2014
p240
aVthat it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.
p241
aVIt's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan;
p242
aVthe Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.
p243
aVIt's just symbolism.
p244
aVAnd that was even worse
p245
aVthan actually what had just happened in many ways,
p246
aVbecause it couldn't not work.
p247
aVI'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank,
p248
aVIndia, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was,
p249
aVand they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity,
p250
aVwe can move aid, we can vaccinate children.
p251
aVChildren can lead their projects.
p252
aVThey can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved."
p253
aVThat's what I'd heard.
p254
aVAnd I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd so I went back to the United Nations.
p257
aVI decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.
p258
aVAnd I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.
p259
aVWe started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system,
p260
aVgovernments and NGOs,
p261
aVtrying desperately to find somebody
p262
aVto come forward and have a go at it,
p263
aVsee if we could make it possible.
p264
aVAnd after lots and lots of meetings obviously,
p265
aVI'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi,
p266
aVone of my heroes and mentors really,
p267
aVhe managed to get UNICEF involved.
p268
aVAnd UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."
p269
aVAnd then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
p270
aVIt was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan
p271
aVwith UNAMA and WHO
p272
aVand civil society, etc., etc., etc.?
p273
aVAnd I was getting it all on film and I was recording it,
p274
aVand I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.
p275
aVBut even if it doesn't, at least the door is open
p276
aVand there's a chance."
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd so I went back to London,
p279
aVand I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.
p280
aVAnd I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor,
p281
aVI had a connection to him,
p282
aVbecause we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction,
p283
aVwe needed the media to be involved.
p284
aVBecause if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen
p285
aVand there'd be more \u2014
p286
aVwhen we got into certain areas,
p287
aVmaybe there would be more people interested.
p288
aVAnd maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more,
p289
aVwhich had been desperately difficult.
p290
aVI won't go into that.
p291
aVSo Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."
p292
aa(lp293
VWhile I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"
p294
aVI said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?"
p295
aVAnd I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.
p296
aVSo I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?
p297
aVIt'd be really interesting if you came.
p298
aVIt would help and bring attention.
p299
aVAnd that attention
p300
aVwould help leverage the situation,
p301
aVas well as all of the other sides of it."
p302
aVI think there's a number of pillars to success.
p303
aVOne is you've got to have a great idea.
p304
aVThe other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance,
p305
aVand you've got to be able to raise awareness.
p306
aVAnd actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.
p307
aVSo these guys were absolutely crucial.
p308
aVSo he said yes,
p309
aVand we found ourselves in Afghanistan.
p310
aa(lp311
VIt was a really incredible thing that when we landed there,
p312
aVI was talking to various people, and they were saying to me,
p313
aV"You've got to get everybody involved here.
p314
aVYou can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."
p315
aVAnd we did, and we traveled around,
p316
aVand we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses,
p317
aVwe held press conferences, we went out with soldiers,
p318
aVwe sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO,
p319
aVwe sat down with the U.K. government.
p320
aVI mean, we basically sat down with everybody \u2014
p321
aVin and out of schools with ministers of education,
p322
aVholding these press conferences,
p323
aVwhich of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.
p324
aVThere was an interest in what was going on.
p325
aVThis amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on
p326
aVas she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.
p327
aVAnd her Afghan network
p328
aVwas just absolutely everywhere.
p329
aVAnd she was really crucial in getting the message in.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd then we went home. We'd sort of done it.
p332
aVWe had to wait now and see what happened.
p333
aVAnd I got home,
p334
aVand I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me
p335
aVfrom the Taliban.
p336
aVAnd that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.
p337
aVWe will observe this day.
p338
aVWe see it as a window of opportunity.
p339
aVAnd we will not engage. We're not going to engage."
p340
aVAnd that meant that humanitarian workers
p341
aVwouldn't be kidnapped or killed.
p342
aVAnd then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
p343
aVAnd days later,
p344
aV1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio
p345
aVas a consequence of everybody stopping.
p346
aV(Applause)
p347
aVAnd like the General Assembly,
p348
aVobviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together
p351
aVbecause we had to go back.
p352
aVWe put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.
p353
aVWe went back to Afghanistan,
p354
aVbecause the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.
p355
aVBut more importantly, we wanted to go back,
p356
aVbecause these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
p357
aVThey were the people who believed in peace
p358
aVand the possibilities of it, etc., etc. \u2014 and they made it real.
p359
aVAnd we wanted to go back and show them the film
p360
aVand say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."
p361
aVAnd we gave the film over.
p362
aVObviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd then that year, that year, 2008,
p365
aVthis ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th:
p366
aV"General Stanley McChrystal,
p367
aVcommander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan,
p368
aVannounced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations
p369
aVon the 21st of September."
p370
aVThey were saying they would stop.
p371
aVAnd then there was this other statement
p372
aVthat came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety
p373
aVsaying that, in Afghanistan,
p374
aVbecause of this work,
p375
aVthe violence was down by 70 percent.
p376
aV70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.
p377
aVAnd that completely blew my mind
p378
aValmost more than anything.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano,
p381
aVwhich was obviously much less harmful.
p382
aVAnd I was there thinking about what was going on.
p383
aVAnd I kept thinking about this 70 percent.
p384
aV70 percent reduction in violence \u2014
p385
aVin what everyone said was completely impossible
p386
aVand you couldn't do.
p387
aVAnd that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan,
p388
aVthen surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.
p389
aVWe have to go for a global truce.
p390
aVWe have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence
p391
aVand go for a global truce,
p392
aVgo for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities,
p393
aVboth domestically and internationally, ever recorded.
p394
aa(lp395
VThat's exactly what we must do.
p396
aVAnd on the 21st of September this year,
p397
aVwe're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena
p398
aVto go for that process,
p399
aVto try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.
p400
aVAnd we will utilize all kinds of things \u2014
p401
aVhave a dance and social media
p402
aVand visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
p403
aVAnd it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.
p404
aVAnd we'll globally link with government, inter-government,
p405
aVnon-government, education, unions, sports.
p406
aVAnd you can see the education box there.
p407
aVWe've got resources at the moment in 174 countries
p408
aVtrying to get young people to be the driving force
p409
aVbehind the vision of that global truce.
p410
aVAnd obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.
p411
aa(lp412
VLinking up with the Olympics \u2014
p413
aVI went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.
p414
aVUltimately, that's what it's about."
p415
aVWhy don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?
p416
aVWhy don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?
p417
aVWe'll make a new film about this process.
p418
aVWe'll utilize sport and football.
p419
aVOn the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played,
p420
aVfrom the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.
p421
aVSo, utilizing all of these ways
p422
aVto inspire individual action.
p423
aVAnd ultimately, we have to try that.
p424
aVWe have to work together.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd when I stand here in front of all of you,
p427
aVand the people who will watch these things,
p428
aVI'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met,
p429
aVthat there is a possibility that our world could unite,
p430
aVthat we could come together as one,
p431
aVthat we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues,
p432
aVbrought about by individuals.
p433
aVI was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.
p434
aVI think he's one of the most incredible men
p435
aVin relation to international politics \u2014 in Afghanistan, in Iraq.
p436
aVHe's an amazing man.
p437
aVAnd I sat with him a few weeks ago.
p438
aVAnd I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?
p439
aVIs this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?"
p440
aVHe said, "It's absolutely possible."
p441
aVI said, "What would you do?
p442
aVWould you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"
p443
aVHe said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."
p444
aVIt's all about the individuals.
p445
aVIt's all about you and me.
p446
aVIt's all about partnerships.
p447
aVIt's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.
p448
aVBecause together, by working together,
p449
aVI seriously think we can start to change things.
p450
aa(lp451
VAnd there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is,
p452
aVwho said to me a few days ago \u2014 because I did a little rehearsal \u2014
p453
aVand he said, "I've been thinking about this day
p454
aVand imagining it as a square
p455
aVwith 365 squares,
p456
aVand one of them is white."
p457
aVAnd it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.
p458
aVIf you put one drop,
p459
aVone drop of something, in that water,
p460
aVit'll change it forever.
