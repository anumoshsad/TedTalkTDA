VAs an Arab female photographer,
p4
aVI have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences.
p5
aVThe passion I developed for knowledge,
p6
aVwhich allowed me to break barriers towards a better life
p7
aVwas the motivation  for my project I Read I Write.
p8
aa(lp9
VPushed by my own experience,
p10
aVas I was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education,
p11
aVI decided to explore and document stories of other women
p12
aVwho changed their lives through education,
p13
aVwhile exposing and questioning the barriers they face.
p14
aVI covered a range of topics that concern women's education,
p15
aVkeeping in mind the differences among Arab countries
p16
aVdue to economic and social factors.
p17
aVThese issues include female illiteracy, which is quite high in the region;
p18
aVeducational reforms; programs for dropout students;
p19
aVand political activism among university students.
p20
aVAs I started this work,
p21
aVit was not always easy  to convince the women to participate.
p22
aVOnly after explaining to them
p23
aVhow their stories might influence other women's lives,
p24
aVhow they would become role models for their own community, did some agree.
p25
aVSeeking a collaborative and reflexive approach,
p26
aVI asked them to write their own words and ideas
p27
aVon prints of their own images.
p28
aVThose images were then shared in some of the classrooms,
p29
aVand worked to inspire and motivate other women
p30
aVgoing through similar educations  and situations.
p31
aVAisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,
p32
aV"I sought education in order to be independent
p33
aVand to not count on men with everything."
p34
aa(lp35
VOne of my first subjects was Umm El-Saad from Egypt.
p36
aVWhen we first met, she was barely able to write her name.
p37
aVShe was attending a nine-month literacy program
p38
aVrun by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.
p39
aVMonths later, she was joking that her husband
p40
aVhad threatened to pull her out of the classes,
p41
aVas he found out that his now literate wife
p42
aVwas going through his phone text messages.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVNaughty Umm El-Saad.
p45
aVOf course, that's not why Umm El-Saad joined the program.
p46
aVI saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines,
p47
aVsmall details that we take for granted,
p48
aVfrom counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework.
p49
aVDespite her poverty and her community's mindset,
p50
aVwhich belittles women's education,
p51
aVUmm El-Saad, along with her Egyptian classmates,
p52
aVwas eager to learn how to read and write.
p53
aa(lp54
VIn Tunisia, I met Asma,
p55
aVone of the four activist women I interviewed.
p56
aVThe secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media.
p57
aVRegarding her country, which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring,
p58
aVshe said, "I've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria.
p59
aVNow, after the revolution, we have a new one every single day."
p60
aVAsma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region,
p61
aVwhich is another obstacle to women in particular.
p62
aa(lp63
VOut of all the women I met, Fayza from Yemen affected me the most.
p64
aVFayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married.
p65
aVThat marriage lasted for a year.
p66
aVAt 14, she became the third wife of a 60-year-old man,
p67
aVand by the time she was 18, she was a divorced mother of three.
p68
aVDespite her poverty,
p69
aVdespite her social status as a divorcée in an ultra-conservative society,
p70
aVand despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school,
p71
aVFayza knew that her only way to control her life was through education.
p72
aVShe is now 26.
p73
aVShe received a grant from a local NGO
p74
aVto fund her business studies at the university.
p75
aVHer goal is to find a job, rent a place to live in,
p76
aVand bring her kids back with her.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe Arab states are going through tremendous change,
p79
aVand the struggles women face are overwhelming.
p80
aVJust like the women I photographed,
p81
aVI had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer I am today,
p82
aVmany people along the way telling me what I can and cannot do.
p83
aVUmm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza, and many women across the Arab world,
p84
aVshow that it is possible to overcome barriers to education,
p85
aVwhich they know is the best means to a better future.
p86
aVAnd here I would like to end with a quote by Yasmine,
p87
aVone of the four activist women I interviewed in Tunisia.
p88
aVYasmine wrote,
p89
aV"Question your convictions.
p90
aVBe who you to want to be, not who they want you to be.
p91
aVDon't accept their enslavement, for your mother birthed you free."
p92
aa(lp93
VThank you.
