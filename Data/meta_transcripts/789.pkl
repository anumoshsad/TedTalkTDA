VI only have three minutes
p4
aVso I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will
p5
aVuse up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.
p6
aVSo, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket
p7
aVthat got me thinking.
p8
aVI've had some time to think it over.
p9
aVAnd energy efficiency is more than just
p10
aVabout the vehicle \u2014
p11
aVit's also about the road.
p12
aa(lp13
VRoad design makes a difference, particularly intersections,
p14
aVof which there are two types: signalized
p15
aVand unsignalized, which means stop signs.
p16
aVFifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
p17
aVRoundabouts are much better.
p18
aVA study of 24 intersections
p19
aVhas found crashes drop 40 percent
p20
aVfrom when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.
p21
aVInjury crashes have dropped 76 percent,
p22
aVfatal crashes down 90 percent.
p23
aVBut that's just safety.
p24
aVWhat about time and gas?
p25
aVSo, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,
p26
aVwhich means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,
p27
aVless time wasted,
p28
aVand that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency
p29
aVthan we have in the United States.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, unsignalized intersections,
p32
aVmeaning stop signs, they save many lives,
p33
aVbut there's an excessive proliferation of them.
p34
aVSmall roundabouts are starting to appear.
p35
aVThis is one in my neighborhood. And they are
p36
aVmuch better \u2014 better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.
p37
aVThey're expensive to install,
p38
aVbut they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut they are not applicable in all situations.
p41
aVSo, take, for example, the three-way intersection.
p42
aVSo, it's logical that you'd have one there,
p43
aVon the minor road entering the major.
p44
aVBut the other two are somewhat questionable.
p45
aVSo, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
p46
aVCars rarely appear on that third road.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd so, the question is, what does that cost us?
p49
aVThat intersection I looked at had about 3,000
p50
aVcars per day in each direction,
p51
aVand so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.
p52
aVThat's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,
p53
aVthat's $51,000 per year.
p54
aVThat's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,
p55
aVwear on the car, and time.
p56
aVWhat's that time worth?
p57
aVWell, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,
p58
aVthat's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.
p59
aVis $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
p60
aVAdd that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,
p61
aVjust for that sign in each direction.
p62
aa(lp63
VDiscount that back to the present, at five percent:
p64
aVover two million dollars
p65
aVfor a stop sign, in each direction.
p66
aVNow, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,
p67
aVyou could actually buy the property,
p68
aVcut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,
p69
aVand then sell it off again.
p70
aVAnd you'd still come out ahead.
p71
aVSo, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
p72
aVI mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
p73
aVBecause it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?
p74
aa(lp75
VThe answer is to enable cars
p76
aVto come in from that side road safely.
p77
aVBecause there are a lot of people who might live up there
p78
aVand if they're waiting forever a long queue could form
p79
aVbecause the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
p80
aVCan that be accomplished with existing signs?
p81
aVSo, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.
p82
aVStop signs were invented in 1915,
p83
aVyield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, why not use a yield sign?
p86
aVWell the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
p87
aVThat means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait
p88
aVtill they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion
p89
aVof alternating, or taking turns,
p90
aVand it's always on the minor road,
p91
aVallowing the major one to have primacy.
p92
aVSo, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.
p93
aVYou couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember
p94
aVwhat you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."
p95
aVThat would not work.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, what the world needs now
p98
aVis a new type of sign.
p99
aV(Applause)
p100
aVSo, you'd have a little instruction below it,
p101
aVyou know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
p102
aVAnd it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
p103
aVIt's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.
p104
aVAnd uncertainty results in caution.
p105
aVWhen people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with
p106
aVthey slow down.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVdon't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.
p111
aVBut you all are members of communities,
p112
aVand you can exercise your community influence
p113
aVto create more sensible traffic flows.
p114
aVAnd you can have more impact on the environment
p115
aVjust getting your neighborhood to change these things
p116
aVthan by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.
