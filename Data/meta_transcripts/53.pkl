VIf you're here today \u2014
p4
aVand I'm very happy that you are \u2014
p5
aVyou've all heard about how sustainable development
p6
aVwill save us from ourselves.
p7
aVHowever, when we're not at TED, we are often told
p8
aVthat a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible,
p9
aVespecially in large urban areas like New York City.
p10
aVAnd that's because most people with decision-making powers,
p11
aVin both the public and the private sector,
p12
aVreally don't feel as though they're in danger.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog \u2014
p15
aVan abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
p16
aVShe turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
p17
aVWhen she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility
p18
aVplanned for the East River waterfront
p19
aVdespite the fact that our small part of New York City
p20
aValready handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste:
p21
aVa sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,
p22
aVthe world's largest food-distribution center,
p23
aVas well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips
p24
aVto the area each week.
p25
aVThe area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo when I was contacted by the Parks Department
p28
aVabout a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects,
p29
aVI thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.
p30
aVI'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river,
p31
aVbecause of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.
p32
aVThen, while jogging with my dog one morning,
p33
aVshe pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
p34
aVThere were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here,
p35
aVbut she kept dragging me,
p36
aVand lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
p37
aVI knew that this forgotten little street-end,
p38
aVabandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
p39
aVAnd I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings
p40
aVof the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
p43
aVWe garnered much support along the way,
p44
aVand the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park
p45
aVthat the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.
p46
aVWe leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times,
p47
aVinto a $3 million park.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Audience whistles)
p52
aa(lp53
VThank you very much.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VThat's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VBut those of us living in environmental justice communities
p64
aVare the canary in the coal mine.
p65
aVWe feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
p66
aVEnvironmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term,
p67
aVgoes something like this:
p68
aVno community should be saddled with more environmental burdens
p69
aVand less environmental benefits than any other.
p70
aa(lp71
VUnfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators
p72
aVas to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees,
p73
aVand where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.
p74
aVAs a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person
p75
aVto live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.
p76
aVI am five times more likely to live within walking distance
p77
aVof a power plant or chemical facility,
p78
aVwhich I do.
p79
aVThese land-use decisions created the hostile conditions
p80
aVthat lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.
p81
aVWhy would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
p82
aVOur 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country,
p83
aVand diabetes comes with it.
p84
aVOne out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
p85
aVOur asthma hospitalization rate
p86
aVis seven times higher than the national average.
p87
aVThese impacts are coming everyone's way.
p88
aVAnd we all pay dearly for solid waste costs,
p89
aVhealth problems associated with pollution and more odiously,
p90
aVthe cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men,
p91
aVwho possess untold amounts of untapped potential.
p92
aVFifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line;
p93
aV25 percent of us are unemployed.
p94
aVLow-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.
p95
aVThis comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
p96
aVPoor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.
p97
aa(lp98
VFortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions
p99
aVthat won't compromise the lives
p100
aVof low-income communities of color in the short term,
p101
aVand won't destroy us all in the long term.
p102
aVNone of us want that, and we all have that in common.
p103
aVSo what else do we have in common?
p104
aa(lp105
VWell, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VGraduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees,
p110
aVtraveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens,
p111
aVfinancially stable, never been imprisoned.
p112
aVOK. Good.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VBut, besides being a black woman,
p117
aVI am different from most of you in some other ways.
p118
aVI watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.
p119
aVMy big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,
p120
aVonly to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.
p121
aVJesus.
p122
aVI grew up with a crack house across the street.
p123
aVYeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
p124
aVThese things make me different from you.
p125
aVBut the things we have in common
p126
aVset me apart from most of the people in my community,
p127
aVand I am in between these two worlds
p128
aVwith enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo how did things get so different for us?
p131
aVIn the late '40s, my dad \u2014 a Pullman porter, son of a slave \u2014
p132
aVbought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx,
p133
aVand a few years later, he married my mom.
p134
aVAt the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
p135
aVMy dad was not alone.
p136
aVAnd as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream,
p137
aVwhite flight became common in the South Bronx
p138
aVand in many cities around the country.
p139
aVRed-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city,
p140
aVincluding ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.
p141
aVMany landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings
p142
aVand collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions \u2014
p143
aVdead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.
p144
aa(lp145
VHunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community,
p146
aVbut now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
p147
aVA national highway construction boom was added to our problems.
p148
aVIn New York State,
p149
aVRobert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.
p150
aVOne of its primary goals was to make it easier
p151
aVfor residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
p152
aVThe South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.
p153
aVResidents were often given less than a month's notice
p154
aVbefore their buildings were razed.
p155
aV600,000 people were displaced.
p156
aVThe common perception was
p157
aVthat only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
p158
aVAnd if you are told from your earliest days
p159
aVthat nothing good is going to come from your community,
p160
aVthat it's bad and ugly,
p161
aVhow could it not reflect on you?
p162
aVSo now, my family's property was worthless,
p163
aVsave for that it was our home, and all we had.
p164
aVAnd luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it,
p165
aValong with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, why is this story important?
p168
aVBecause from a planning perspective,
p169
aVeconomic degradation begets environmental degradation,
p170
aVwhich begets social degradation.
p171
aVThe disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage
p172
aVfor all the environmental injustices that were to come.
p173
aVAntiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day
p174
aVto continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
p175
aVAre these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
p176
aVWhat costs are associated with these decisions?
p177
aVAnd who pays? Who profits?
p178
aVDoes anything justify what the local community goes through?
p179
aVThis was "planning" \u2014 in quotes \u2014
p180
aVthat did not have our best interests in mind.
p181
aa(lp182
VOnce we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.
p183
aVThat small park I told you about earlier
p184
aVwas the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
p185
aVI wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant
p186
aVto design the plan for a waterfront esplanade
p187
aVwith dedicated on-street bike paths.
p188
aVPhysical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety,
p189
aVthe placement of the waste and other facilities,
p190
aVwhich, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
p191
aVThey provide opportunities to be more physically active,
p192
aVas well as local economic development.
p193
aVThink bike shops, juice stands.
p194
aVWe secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
p195
aVThis is Lafayette Avenue \u2014
p196
aVand that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
p197
aVAnd once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx
p198
aVwith more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
p199
aVRight now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
p200
aa(lp201
VAs we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
p202
aVWe run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training,
p203
aVwhich provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration,
p204
aVso that folks from our community have the skills to compete
p205
aVfor these well-paying jobs.
p206
aVLittle by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs \u2014
p207
aVand with people that have both a financial and personal stake
p208
aVin their environment.
p209
aVThe Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic
p210
aVof the Robert Moses era,
p211
aVbuilt with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
p212
aVEven during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
p213
aVThe community created an alternative transportation plan
p214
aVthat allows for the removal of the highway.
p215
aVWe have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders
p216
aVto re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized
p217
aVfor parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
p218
aa(lp219
VWe also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project
p220
aVon top of our offices.
p221
aVCool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,
p222
aVand pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
p223
aVGreen roofs are soil and living plants.
p224
aVBoth can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials
p225
aVthat absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect
p226
aVand degrade under the sun,
p227
aVwhich we in turn breathe.
p228
aVGreen roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall,
p229
aVso they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions \u2014
p230
aVwhich, incidentally, are often located
p231
aVin environmental justice communities like mine.
p232
aVAnd they provide habitats for our little friends!
p233
aa(lp234
V[Butterfly]
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VSo cool!
p239
aa(lp240
VAnyway, the demonstration project is a springboard
p241
aVfor our own green roof installation business,
p242
aVbringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
p243
aa(lp244
V[Green is the new black ...]
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VI like that, too.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here,
p251
aVbut since I have all of your attention:
p252
aVWe need investors. End of pitch.
p253
aVIt's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
p254
aVAnyway \u2014
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VOK. Katrina.
p261
aa(lp262
VPrior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward
p263
aVhad a lot in common.
p264
aVBoth were largely populated by poor people of color,
p265
aVboth hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
p266
aVBoth are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents
p267
aVin close proximity of one another.
p268
aVIn the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
p269
aVWe're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst,
p270
aVby negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning
p271
aVand lax governmental accountability.
p272
aVNeither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
p273
aVBut we have emerged with valuable lessons
p274
aVabout how to dig ourselves out.
p275
aVWe are more than simply national symbols of urban blight
p276
aVor problems to be solved by empty campaign promises
p277
aVof presidents come and gone.
p278
aVNow will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two,
p279
aVlike the South Bronx did?
p280
aVOr will we take proactive steps
p281
aVand learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists
p282
aVthat have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
p283
aa(lp284
VNow listen, I do not expect individuals,
p285
aVcorporations or government to make the world a better place
p286
aVbecause it is right or moral.
p287
aVThis presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.
p288
aVLike a tiny little bit. You've no clue.
p289
aVBut I'll tell you later, if you want to know.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VBut \u2014 I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it,
p294
aVthat motivates people in the end.
p295
aVI'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line"
p296
aVthat sustainable development can produce.
p297
aVDevelopments that have the potential to create positive returns
p298
aVfor all concerned: the developers, government
p299
aVand the community where these projects go up.
p300
aa(lp301
VAt present, that's not happening in New York City.
p302
aVAnd we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit.
p303
aVA parade of government subsidies
p304
aVis going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx,
p305
aVbut there is scant coordination between city agencies
p306
aVon how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution,
p307
aVsolid waste and the impacts on open space.
p308
aVAnd their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame
p309
aVit's not even funny.
p310
aVBecause on top of that,
p311
aVthe world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built
p312
aVby destroying two well-loved community parks.
p313
aVNow, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
p314
aVAnd although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars,
p315
aVthese projects include thousands of new parking spaces,
p316
aVyet zip in terms of mass public transit.
p317
aVNow, what's missing from the larger debate
p318
aVis a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis
p319
aVbetween not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community,
p320
aVversus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
p321
aVMy agency is working closely with Columbia University and others
p322
aVto shine a light on these issues.
p323
aa(lp324
VNow let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.
p325
aVOurs is a city, not a wilderness preserve.
p326
aVAnd I've embraced my inner capitalist.
p327
aVAnd, but I don't have \u2014
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VYou probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VSo I don't have a problem with developers making money.
p336
aVThere's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable,
p337
aVcommunity-friendly development can still make a fortune.
p338
aVFellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins \u2014
p339
aVboth heroes of mine by the way \u2014 have shown that you can actually do that.
p340
aVI do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit
p341
aVpolitically vulnerable communities for profit.
p342
aVThat it continues is a shame upon us all,
p343
aVbecause we are all responsible for the future that we create.
p344
aVBut one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities,
p345
aVis to learn from visionaries in other cities.
p346
aVThis is my version of globalization.
p347
aa(lp348
VLet's take Bogota.
p349
aVPoor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;
p350
aVa reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
p351
aVHowever, this city was blessed in the late 1990s
p352
aVwith a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.
p353
aVHe looked at the demographics.
p354
aVFew Bogotanos own cars,
p355
aVyet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.
p356
aVIf you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
p357
aVHis administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three,
p358
aVoutlawed parking on those streets,
p359
aVexpanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes,
p360
aVcreated public plazas,
p361
aVcreated one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems
p362
aVin the entire world.
p363
aVFor his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
p364
aVBut as people began to see that they were being put first
p365
aVon issues reflecting their day-to-day lives,
p366
aVincredible things happened.
p367
aVPeople stopped littering.
p368
aVCrime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people.
p369
aVHis administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time,
p370
aVand on a third-world budget, at that.
p371
aVWe have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry.
p372
aVBut the bottom line is: their people-first agenda
p373
aVwas not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars,
p374
aVbut rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate
p375
aVin the city's resurgence.
p376
aVThat development should not come
p377
aVat the expense of the majority of the population
p378
aVis still considered a radical idea here in the U.S.
p379
aVBut Bogota's example has the power to change that.
p380
aa(lp381
VYou, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
p382
aVThat's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
p383
aVUse your influence
p384
aVin support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere.
p385
aVDon't just talk about it at TED.
p386
aVThis is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build,
p387
aVand as you all know, politics are personal.
p388
aVHelp me make green the new black.
p389
aVHelp me make sustainability sexy.
p390
aVMake it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
p391
aVHelp me fight for environmental and economic justice.
p392
aVSupport investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
p393
aVHelp me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table,
p394
aVand insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
p395
aVOh good, glad I have a little more time!
p396
aa(lp397
VListen \u2014 when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast,
p398
aVI asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included
p399
aVin his new marketing strategy.
p400
aVHis response was a grant program.
p401
aVI don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
p402
aVI was making him an offer.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VWhat troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.
p407
aVNow, don't get me wrong, we need money.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VBut grassroots groups are needed at the table
p412
aVduring the decision-making process.
p413
aVOf the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us
p414
aVthat we waste every day,
p415
aVdon't add wasting our energy, intelligence
p416
aVand hard-earned experience to that count.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Applause)
p419
aa(lp420
VI have come from so far to meet you like this.
p421
aVPlease don't waste me.
p422
aVBy working together,
p423
aVwe can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals
p424
aVwho actually have the audacity and courage
p425
aVto believe that we actually can change the world.
p426
aVWe might have come to this conference
p427
aVfrom very, very different stations in life,
p428
aVbut believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing.
p429
aVWe have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
