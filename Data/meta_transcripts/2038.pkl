VI'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.
p4
aVI soared through the galaxy
p5
aVdriving a huge starship
p6
aVwith a crew made up of people
p7
aVfrom all over this world,
p8
aVmany different races, many different cultures,
p9
aVmany different heritages,
p10
aVall working together,
p11
aVand our mission was to explore strange new worlds,
p12
aVto seek out new life and new civilizations,
p13
aVto boldly go where no one has gone before.
p14
aa(lp15
VWell \u2014
p16
aV(Applause) \u2014
p17
aVI am the grandson of immigrants from Japan
p18
aVwho went to America,
p19
aVboldly going to a strange new world,
p20
aVseeking new opportunities.
p21
aVMy mother was born in Sacramento, California.
p22
aVMy father was a San Franciscan.
p23
aVThey met and married in Los Angeles,
p24
aVand I was born there.
p25
aa(lp26
VI was four years old
p27
aVwhen Pearl Harbor was bombed
p28
aVon December 7, 1941 by Japan,
p29
aVand overnight, the world was plunged
p30
aVinto a world war.
p31
aVAmerica suddenly was swept up
p32
aVby hysteria.
p33
aVJapanese-Americans,
p34
aVAmerican citizens of Japanese ancestry,
p35
aVwere looked on
p36
aVwith suspicion and fear
p37
aVand with outright hatred
p38
aVsimply because we happened to look like
p39
aVthe people that bombed Pearl Harbor.
p40
aVAnd the hysteria grew and grew
p41
aVuntil in February 1942,
p42
aVthe president of the United States,
p43
aVFranklin Delano Roosevelt,
p44
aVordered all Japanese-Americans
p45
aVon the West Coast of America
p46
aVto be summarily rounded up
p47
aVwith no charges, with no trial,
p48
aVwith no due process.
p49
aVDue process, this is a core pillar
p50
aVof our justice system.
p51
aVThat all disappeared.
p52
aVWe were to be rounded up
p53
aVand imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps
p54
aVin some of the most desolate places in America:
p55
aVthe blistering hot desert of Arizona,
p56
aVthe sultry swamps of Arkansas,
p57
aVthe wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
p58
aVand two of the most desolate places in California.
p59
aa(lp60
VOn April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,
p61
aVand just a few weeks after my birthday,
p62
aVmy parents got my younger brother,
p63
aVmy baby sister and me
p64
aVup very early one morning,
p65
aVand they dressed us hurriedly.
p66
aVMy brother and I were in the living room
p67
aVlooking out the front window,
p68
aVand we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.
p69
aVThey carried bayonets on their rifles.
p70
aVThey stomped up the front porch
p71
aVand banged on the door.
p72
aVMy father answered it,
p73
aVand the soldiers ordered us out of our home.
p74
aVMy father gave my brother and me
p75
aVsmall luggages to carry,
p76
aVand we walked out and stood on the driveway
p77
aVwaiting for our mother to come out,
p78
aVand when my mother finally came out,
p79
aVshe had our baby sister in one arm,
p80
aVa huge duffel bag in the other,
p81
aVand tears were streaming down both her cheeks.
p82
aVI will never be able to forget that scene.
p83
aVIt is burned into my memory.
p84
aa(lp85
VWe were taken from our home
p86
aVand loaded on to train cars
p87
aVwith other Japanese-American families.
p88
aVThere were guards stationed
p89
aVat both ends of each car,
p90
aVas if we were criminals.
p91
aVWe were taken two thirds of the way across the country,
p92
aVrocking on that train for four days and three nights,
p93
aVto the swamps of Arkansas.
p94
aVI still remember the barbed wire fence
p95
aVthat confined me.
p96
aVI remember the tall sentry tower
p97
aVwith the machine guns pointed at us.
p98
aVI remember the searchlight that followed me
p99
aVwhen I made the night runs
p100
aVfrom my barrack to the latrine.
p101
aVBut to five-year-old me,
p102
aVI thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way
p103
aVfor me to pee.
p104
aVI was a child,
p105
aVtoo young to understand the circumstances
p106
aVof my being there.
p107
aa(lp108
VChildren are amazingly adaptable.
p109
aVWhat would be grotesquely abnormal
p110
aVbecame my normality
p111
aVin the prisoner of war camps.
p112
aVIt became routine for me to line up three times a day
p113
aVto eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.
p114
aVIt became normal for me to go with my father
p115
aVto bathe in a mass shower.
p116
aVBeing in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,
p117
aVbecame my normality.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhen the war ended,
p120
aVwe were released,
p121
aVand given a one-way ticket
p122
aVto anywhere in the United States.
p123
aVMy parents decided to go back home
p124
aVto Los Angeles,
p125
aVbut Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.
p126
aVWe were penniless.
p127
aVEverything had been taken from us,
p128
aVand the hostility was intense.
p129
aVOur first home was on Skid Row
p130
aVin the lowest part of our city,
p131
aVliving with derelicts, drunkards
p132
aVand crazy people,
p133
aVthe stench of urine all over,
p134
aVon the street, in the alley,
p135
aVin the hallway.
p136
aVIt was a horrible experience,
p137
aVand for us kids, it was terrorizing.
p138
aVI remember once
p139
aVa drunkard came staggering down,
p140
aVfell down right in front of us,
p141
aVand threw up.
p142
aVMy baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,"
p143
aVbecause behind barbed wires
p144
aVwas for us
p145
aVhome.
p146
aa(lp147
VMy parents worked hard
p148
aVto get back on their feet.
p149
aVWe had lost everything.
p150
aVThey were at the middle of their lives
p151
aVand starting all over.
p152
aVThey worked their fingers to the bone,
p153
aVand ultimately they were able
p154
aVto get the capital together to buy
p155
aVa three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.
p156
aVAnd I was a teenager,
p157
aVand I became very curious
p158
aVabout my childhood imprisonment.
p159
aVI had read civics books that told me about
p160
aVthe ideals of American democracy.
p161
aVAll men are created equal,
p162
aVwe have an inalienable right
p163
aVto life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
p164
aVand I couldn't quite make that fit
p165
aVwith what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.
p166
aVI read history books,
p167
aVand I couldn't find anything about it.
p168
aVAnd so I engaged my father after dinner
p169
aVin long, sometimes heated conversations.
p170
aVWe had many, many conversations like that,
p171
aVand what I got from them
p172
aVwas my father's wisdom.
p173
aVHe was the one that suffered the most
p174
aVunder those conditions of imprisonment,
p175
aVand yet he understood American democracy.
p176
aVHe told me that our democracy
p177
aVis a people's democracy,
p178
aVand it can be as great as the people can be,
p179
aVbut it is also as fallible as people are.
p180
aVHe told me that American democracy
p181
aVis vitally dependent on good people
p182
aVwho cherish the ideals of our system
p183
aVand actively engage in the process
p184
aVof making our democracy work.
p185
aVAnd he took me to a campaign headquarters \u2014
p186
aVthe governor of Illinois was running for the presidency \u2014
p187
aVand introduced me to American electoral politics.
p188
aVAnd he also told me about
p189
aVyoung Japanese-Americans
p190
aVduring the Second World War.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhen Pearl Harbor was bombed,
p193
aVyoung Japanese-Americans, like all young Americans,
p194
aVrushed to their draft board
p195
aVto volunteer to fight for our country.
p196
aVThat act of patriotism
p197
aVwas answered with a slap in the face.
p198
aVWe were denied service,
p199
aVand categorized as enemy non-alien.
p200
aVIt was outrageous to be called an enemy
p201
aVwhen you're volunteering to fight for your country,
p202
aVbut that was compounded with the word "non-alien,"
p203
aVwhich is a word that means
p204
aV"citizen" in the negative.
p205
aVThey even took the word "citizen" away from us,
p206
aVand imprisoned them for a whole year.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd then the government realized
p209
aVthat there's a wartime manpower shortage,
p210
aVand as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,
p211
aVthey opened up the military for service
p212
aVby young Japanese-Americans.
p213
aVIt was totally irrational,
p214
aVbut the amazing thing,
p215
aVthe astounding thing,
p216
aVis that thousands of young
p217
aVJapanese-American men and women
p218
aVagain went from behind those barbed-wire fences,
p219
aVput on the same uniform as that of our guards,
p220
aVleaving their families in imprisonment,
p221
aVto fight for this country.
p222
aa(lp223
VThey said that they were going to fight
p224
aVnot only to get their families out
p225
aVfrom behind those barbed-wire fences,
p226
aVbut because they cherished the very ideal
p227
aVof what our government stands for,
p228
aVshould stand for,
p229
aVand that was being abrogated
p230
aVby what was being done.
p231
aa(lp232
VAll men are created equal.
p233
aVAnd they went to fight for this country.
p234
aVThey were put into a segregated
p235
aVall Japanese-American unit
p236
aVand sent to the battlefields of Europe,
p237
aVand they threw themselves into it.
p238
aVThey fought with amazing,
p239
aVincredible courage and valor.
p240
aVThey were sent out on the most dangerous missions
p241
aVand they sustained the highest combat casualty rate
p242
aVof any unit proportionally.
p243
aa(lp244
VThere is one battle that illustrates that.
p245
aVIt was a battle for the Gothic Line.
p246
aVThe Germans were embedded
p247
aVin this mountain hillside,
p248
aVrocky hillside,
p249
aVin impregnable caves,
p250
aVand three allied battalions
p251
aVhad been pounding away at it
p252
aVfor six months,
p253
aVand they were stalemated.
p254
aVThe 442nd was called in
p255
aVto add to the fight,
p256
aVbut the men of the 442nd
p257
aVcame up with a unique
p258
aVbut dangerous idea:
p259
aVThe backside of the mountain
p260
aVwas a sheer rock cliff.
p261
aVThe Germans thought an attack from the backside
p262
aVwould be impossible.
p263
aVThe men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.
p264
aVOn a dark, moonless night,
p265
aVthey began scaling that rock wall,
p266
aVa drop of more than 1,000 feet,
p267
aVin full combat gear.
p268
aVThey climbed all night long
p269
aVon that sheer cliff.
p270
aVIn the darkness,
p271
aVsome lost their handhold
p272
aVor their footing
p273
aVand they fell to their deaths
p274
aVin the ravine below.
p275
aVThey all fell silently.
p276
aVNot a single one cried out,
p277
aVso as not to give their position away.
p278
aVThe men climbed for eight hours straight,
p279
aVand those who made it to the top
p280
aVstayed there until the first break of light,
p281
aVand as soon as light broke,
p282
aVthey attacked.
p283
aVThe Germans were surprised,
p284
aVand they took the hill
p285
aVand broke the Gothic Line.
p286
aVA six-month stalemate
p287
aVwas broken by the 442nd
p288
aVin 32 minutes.
p289
aa(lp290
VIt was an amazing act,
p291
aVand when the war ended,
p292
aVthe 442nd returned to the United States
p293
aVas the most decorated unit
p294
aVof the entire Second World War.
p295
aVThey were greeted back on the White House Lawn
p296
aVby President Truman, who said to them,
p297
aV"You fought not only the enemy
p298
aVbut prejudice, and you won."
p299
aa(lp300
VThey are my heroes.
p301
aVThey clung to their belief
p302
aVin the shining ideals of this country,
p303
aVand they proved that being an American
p304
aVis not just for some people,
p305
aVthat race is not how we define being an American.
p306
aVThey expanded what it means to be an American,
p307
aVincluding Japanese-Americans
p308
aVthat were feared and suspected and hated.
p309
aVThey were change agents,
p310
aVand they left for me
p311
aVa legacy.
p312
aVThey are my heroes
p313
aVand my father is my hero,
p314
aVwho understood democracy
p315
aVand guided me through it.
p316
aVThey gave me a legacy,
p317
aVand with that legacy comes a responsibility,
p318
aVand I am dedicated
p319
aVto making my country
p320
aVan even better America,
p321
aVto making our government
p322
aVan even truer democracy,
p323
aVand because of the heroes that I have
p324
aVand the struggles that we've gone through,
p325
aVI can stand before you
p326
aVas a gay Japanese-American,
p327
aVbut even more than that,
p328
aVI am a proud American.
p329
