V"We're declaring war against cancer,
p4
aVand we will win this war by 2015."
p5
aa(lp6
VThis is what the US Congress and the National Cancer Institute declared
p7
aVjust a few years ago, in 2003.
p8
aVNow, I don't know about you, but I don't buy that.
p9
aVI don't think we quite won this war yet,
p10
aVand I don't think anyone here will question that.
p11
aVNow, I will argue that a primary reason
p12
aVwhy we're not winning this war against cancer
p13
aVis because we're fighting blindly.
p14
aa(lp15
VI'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine.
p16
aVHis name is Ehud,
p17
aVand a few years ago, Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.
p18
aVAnd not just any type of brain cancer:
p19
aVhe was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.
p20
aVIn fact, it was so deadly
p21
aVthat the doctors told him that they only have 12 months,
p22
aVand during those 12 months, they have to find a treatment.
p23
aVThey have to find a cure,
p24
aVand if they cannot find a cure, he will die.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, the good news, they said,
p27
aVis that there are tons of different treatments to choose from,
p28
aVbut the bad news is
p29
aVthat in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not,
p30
aVwell, that takes them about three months or so.
p31
aVSo they cannot try that many things.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell, Ehud is now going into his first treatment,
p34
aVand during that first treatment, just a few days into that treatment,
p35
aVI'm meeting with him, and he tells me, "Adam, I think this is working.
p36
aVI think we really lucked out here. Something is happening."
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I ask him, "Really? How do you know that, Ehud?"
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd he says, "Well, I feel so terrible inside.
p41
aVSomething's gotta be working up there.
p42
aVIt just has to."
p43
aa(lp44
VWell, unfortunately, three months later, we got the news, it didn't work.
p45
aVAnd so Ehud goes into his second treatment.
p46
aVAnd again, the same story.
p47
aV"It feels so bad, something's gotta be working there."
p48
aVAnd then three months later, again we get bad news.
p49
aVEhud is going into his third treatment, and then his fourth treatment.
p50
aVAnd then, as predicted, Ehud dies.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle,
p53
aVyou get really swamped with emotions.
p54
aVA lot of things are going through your head.
p55
aVFor me, it was mostly outrage.
p56
aVI was just outraged that, how come this is the best that we can offer?
p57
aVAnd I started looking more and more into this.
p58
aVAs it turns out, this is not just the best that doctors could offer Ehud.
p59
aVIt's not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally.
p60
aVWe're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer.
p61
aa(lp62
VI picked up one of those statistics,
p63
aVand I'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before.
p64
aVThis is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer,
p65
aVin this case females in the United States,
p66
aVever since the 1930s.
p67
aVYou'll notice that there aren't that many things that have changed.
p68
aVIt's still a huge issue.
p69
aVYou'll see a few changes, though.
p70
aVYou'll see lung cancer, for example, on the rise.
p71
aVThank you, cigarettes.
p72
aVAnd you'll also see that, for example, stomach cancer
p73
aVonce used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers,
p74
aVis essentially eliminated.
p75
aVNow, why is that? Anyone knows, by the way?
p76
aVWhy is it that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer?
p77
aVWhat was the huge, huge medical technology breakthrough
p78
aVthat came to our world that saved humanity from stomach cancer?
p79
aVWas it maybe a new drug, or a better diagnostic?
p80
aVYou guys are right, yeah.
p81
aVIt's the invention of the refrigerator,
p82
aVand the fact that we're no longer eating spoiled meats.
p83
aVSo the best thing that happened to us so far
p84
aVin the medical arena in cancer research
p85
aVis the fact that the refrigerator was invented.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so \u2014 yeah, I know.
p90
aVWe're not doing so well here.
p91
aVI don't want to miniaturize the progress
p92
aVand everything that's been done in cancer research.
p93
aVLook, there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research
p94
aVthat discovered major, major things that taught us about cancer.
p95
aVBut all that said,
p96
aVwe have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us.
p97
aa(lp98
VAgain, I will argue that the primary reason why this is the case,
p99
aVwhy we have not done that remarkably well,
p100
aVis really we're fighting blindly here.
p101
aVAnd this is where medical imaging comes in.
p102
aVThis is where my own work comes in.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging
p105
aVthat's offered today to brain cancer patients,
p106
aVor actually generally to all cancer patients,
p107
aVtake a look at this PET scan right here.
p108
aVLet's see. There we go.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo this is a PET/CT scan,
p111
aVand what you'll see in this PET/CT scan
p112
aVis the CT scan will show you where the bones are,
p113
aVand the PET scan will show you where tumors are.
p114
aVNow, what you can see here
p115
aVis essentially a sugar molecule
p116
aVthat was added a small little tag
p117
aVthat is signaling to us outside of the body,
p118
aV"Hey, I'm here."
p119
aVAnd those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions,
p120
aVand they're going all over the body
p121
aVlooking for cells that are hungry for sugar.
p122
aVYou'll see that the heart, for example, lights up there.
p123
aVThat's because the heart needs a lot of sugar.
p124
aVYou'll also see that the bladder lights up there.
p125
aVThat's because the bladder is the thing that's clearing
p126
aVthe sugar away from our body.
p127
aVAnd then you'll see a few other hot spots,
p128
aVand these are in fact the tumors.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, this is a really a wonderful technology.
p131
aVFor the first time it allowed us to look into someone's body
p132
aVwithout picking up each and every one of the cells
p133
aVand putting them under the microscope,
p134
aVbut in a noninvasive way allowing us to look into someone's body
p135
aVand ask, "Hey, has the cancer metastasized?
p136
aVWhere is it?"
p137
aVAnd the PET scans here are showing you very clearly
p138
aVwhere are these hot spots, where is the tumor.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo as miraculous as this might seem,
p141
aVunfortunately, well, it's not that great.
p142
aVYou see, those small little hot spots there.
p143
aVCan anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors?
p144
aVSo it's about 100 million cancer cells,
p145
aVand let me make sure that this number sunk in.
p146
aVIn each and every one of these small little blips
p147
aVthat you're seeing on the image,
p148
aVthere needs to be at least 100 million cancer cells
p149
aVin order for it to be detected.
p150
aVNow, if that seemed to you like a very large number,
p151
aVit is a very large number.
p152
aVThis is in fact an incredibly large number,
p153
aVbecause what we really need in order to pick up something early enough
p154
aVto do something about it, to do something meaningful about it,
p155
aVwell, we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size,
p156
aVand ideally just a handful of cells in size.
p157
aVSo we're clearly pretty far away from this.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we're going to play a little experiment here.
p160
aVI'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine
p161
aVthat you are brain surgeons.
p162
aVAnd you guys are now at an operating room,
p163
aVand there's a patient in front of you,
p164
aVand your task is to make sure that the tumor is out.
p165
aVSo you're looking down at the patient,
p166
aVthe skin and the skull have already been removed,
p167
aVso you're looking at the brain.
p168
aVAnd all you know about this patient
p169
aVis that there's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so
p170
aVin the right frontal lobe of this person's brain.
p171
aVAnd that's more or less it.
p172
aVSo you're looking down, and unfortunately everything looks the same,
p173
aVbecause brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue
p174
aVreally just look the same.
p175
aVAnd so you're going in with your thumb,
p176
aVand you start to press a little bit on the brain,
p177
aVbecause tumors tend to be a little harder, stiffer,
p178
aVand so you go in and go a little bit like this and say,
p179
aV"It seems like the tumor is right there."
p180
aVThen you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor
p181
aVpiece by piece by piece.
p182
aVAnd as you're taking the tumor out,
p183
aVthen you're getting to a stage where you think,
p184
aV"Alright, I'm done. I took out everything."
p185
aVAnd at this stage, if that's \u2014
p186
aVso far everything sounded, like, pretty crazy \u2014
p187
aVyou're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here.
p188
aVBecause now you need to decide,
p189
aVshould I stop here and let this patient go,
p190
aVrisking that there might be some leftover cancer cells behind
p191
aVthat I just couldn't see,
p192
aVor should I take away some extra margins,
p193
aVtypically about an inch or so around the tumor
p194
aVjust to be sure that I removed everything?
p195
aa(lp196
VSo this is not a simple decision to make,
p197
aVand unfortunately this is the decision
p198
aVthat brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day
p199
aVas they're seeing their patients.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd so I remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab,
p202
aVand we say, "Boy, there's got to be a better way."
p203
aVBut not just like you tell a friend that there's got to be a better way.
p204
aVThere's just got to be a better way here.
p205
aVThis is just incredible.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd so we looked back.
p208
aVRemember those PET scans I told you about, the sugar and so on.
p209
aVWe said, hey, how about instead of using sugar molecules,
p210
aVlet's maybe take tiny, tiny little particles made of gold,
p211
aVand let's program them with some interesting chemistry around them.
p212
aVLet's program them to look for cancer cells.
p213
aVAnd then we will inject these gold particles
p214
aVinto these patients by the billions again,
p215
aVand we'll have them go all over the body,
p216
aVand just like secret agents, if you will,
p217
aVgo and walk by every single cell in our body
p218
aVand knock on the door of that cell,
p219
aVand ask, "Are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell?
p220
aVIf you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.
p221
aVIf you're a cancer cell, we're sticking in and shining out
p222
aVand telling us, "Hey, look at me, I'm here."
p223
aVAnd they'll do it through some interesting cameras
p224
aVthat we developed in the lab.
p225
aVAnd once we see that, maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons
p226
aVtowards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone.
p227
aVAnd so we've tested that, and boy, this works well.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo I'm going to show you an example now.
p230
aVWhat you're looking at here
p231
aVis an image of a mouse's brain,
p232
aVand we've implanted into this mouse's brain
p233
aVa small little tumor.
p234
aVAnd so this tumor is now growing in this mouse's brain,
p235
aVand then we've taken a doctor and asked the doctor
p236
aVto please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient,
p237
aVand take out piece by piece out of the tumor.
p238
aVAnd while he's doing that,
p239
aVwe're going to take images to see where the gold particles are.
p240
aVAnd so we're going to first start
p241
aVby injecting these gold particles into this mouse,
p242
aVand we're going to see right here at the very left there
p243
aVthat image at the bottom
p244
aVis the image that shows where the gold particles are.
p245
aVThe nice thing is that these gold particles
p246
aVactually made it all the way to the tumor,
p247
aVand then they shine out and tell us, "Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."
p248
aa(lp249
VSo now we can see the tumor,
p250
aVbut we're not showing this to the doctor yet.
p251
aVWe're asking the doctor, now please start cutting away the tumor,
p252
aVand you'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor
p253
aVand you see that first quadrant is now missing.
p254
aVThe doctor then took the second quadrant, the third,
p255
aVand now it appears to be everything.
p256
aVAnd so at this stage, the doctor came back to us and said,
p257
aV"Alright, I'm done. What do you want me to do?
p258
aVShould I keep things as they are
p259
aVor do you want me to take some extra margins around?"
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd then we said, "Well, hang on."
p262
aVWe told the doctor, "You've missed those two spots,
p263
aVso rather than taking huge margins around,
p264
aVonly take out those tiny little areas.
p265
aVTake them out, and then let's take a look."
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd so the doctor took them away, and lo and behold,
p268
aVthe cancer is now completely gone.
p269
aVNow, the important thing
p270
aVis that it's not just that the cancer is completely gone
p271
aVfrom this person's brain,
p272
aVor from this mouse's brain.
p273
aVThe most important thing
p274
aVis that we did not have to take huge amounts of healthy brain
p275
aVin the process.
p276
aVAnd so now we can actually imagine a world
p277
aVwhere doctors and surgeons, as they take away a tumor,
p278
aVthey actually know what to take out,
p279
aVand they no longer have to guess with their thumb.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow, here's why it's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors.
p282
aVThose leftover tumors, even if it's just a handful of cells,
p283
aVthey will grow to recur the tumor,
p284
aVfor the tumor to come back.
p285
aVIn fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent
p286
aVof those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail
p287
aVis because of those small little extra margins that were left positive,
p288
aVthose small little leftover tumors that were left there.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo this is clearly very nice,
p291
aVbut what I really want to share with you is where I think we're heading from here.
p292
aVAnd so in my lab at Stanford,
p293
aVmy students and I are asking, what should we be working on now?
p294
aVAnd I think where medical imaging is heading to
p295
aVis the ability to look into the human body
p296
aVand actually see each and every one of these cells separately.
p297
aVThe ability like this would allow us
p298
aVto actually pick up tumors way, way earlier in the process,
p299
aVway before it's 100 million cells inside, so we can actually do something about it.
p300
aa(lp301
VAn ability to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us
p302
aVto ask insightful questions.
p303
aVSo in the lab, we are now getting to a point
p304
aVwhere we can actually start asking these cancer cells real questions,
p305
aVlike, for example, are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not?
p306
aVSo if you're not responding, we'll know to stop the treatment right away,
p307
aVdays into the treatment, not three months.
p308
aVAnd so also for patients like Ehud
p309
aVthat are going through these nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,
p310
aVfor them not to suffer
p311
aVthrough those horrendous side effects of the drugs
p312
aVwhen the drugs are in fact not even helping them.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo to be frank here,
p315
aVwe're pretty far away from winning the war against cancer,
p316
aVjust to be realistic.
p317
aVBut at least I am hopeful
p318
aVthat we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques
p319
aVin the way that is not blind.
p320
aa(lp321
VThank you.
