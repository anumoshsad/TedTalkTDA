VMy name is Jonathan Zittrain,
p4
aVand in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.
p5
aVSo I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,
p6
aVand give reason to hope
p7
aVfor the future of the Internet
p8
aVby drawing upon its present.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.
p11
aVPeople are less kind. There is less trust around.
p12
aVI don't know. As a simple example,
p13
aVwe could run a test here.
p14
aVHow many people have ever hitchhiked?
p15
aVI know. How many people have hitchhiked
p16
aVwithin the past 10 years?
p17
aVRight. So what has changed?
p18
aVIt's not better public transportation.
p19
aVSo that's one reason to think that we might be
p20
aVdeclensionists, going in the wrong direction.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I want to give you three examples
p23
aVto try to say that the trend line
p24
aVis in fact in the other direction,
p25
aVand it's the Internet helping it along.
p26
aVSo example number one: the Internet itself.
p27
aVThese are three of the founders of the Internet.
p28
aVThey were actually high school classmates together
p29
aVat the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.
p30
aVYou might have had a French club or a Debate club.
p31
aVThey had a "Let's build a global network" club,
p32
aVand it worked out very well.
p33
aa(lp34
VThey are pictured here for their 25th anniversary
p35
aVNewsweek retrospective on the Internet.
p36
aVAnd as you can tell,
p37
aVthey are basically goof balls.
p38
aVThey had one great limitation
p39
aVand one great freedom
p40
aVas they tried to conceive of a global network.
p41
aVThe limitation was that they didn't have any money.
p42
aVNo particular amount of capital to invest,
p43
aVof the sort that for a physical network
p44
aVyou might need for trucks and people
p45
aVand a hub to move packages around overnight.
p46
aVThey had none of that.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut they had an amazing freedom,
p49
aVwhich was they didn't have to make any money from it.
p50
aVThe Internet has no business plan, never did.
p51
aVNo CEO,
p52
aVno firm responsible, singly, for building it.
p53
aVInstead, it's folks getting together
p54
aVto do something for fun,
p55
aVrather than because they were told to,
p56
aVor because they were expecting to make a mint off of it.
p57
aa(lp58
VThat ethos led to a network architecture,
p59
aVa structure that was unlike
p60
aVother digital networks then or since.
p61
aVSo unusual, in fact,
p62
aVthat it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.
p63
aVAs late as 1992, IBM was known to say
p64
aVyou couldn't possibly build a corporate network
p65
aVusing Internet Protocol.
p66
aVAnd even some Internet engineers today say
p67
aVthe whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VThat's why the mascot of Internet engineering,
p71
aVif it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.
p72
aVBecause the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee
p73
aVis far too large for it to be able to fly.
p74
aVAnd yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.
p75
aVI'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,
p76
aVabout three years ago we finally figured out
p77
aVhow bees fly.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVIt's very complicated, but it turns out they
p80
aVflap their wings very quickly.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VSo what is this bizarre architecture configuration
p84
aVthat makes the network sing and be so unusual?
p85
aVWell, to move data around
p86
aVfrom one place to another \u2014 again, it's not like a package courier.
p87
aVIt's more like a mosh pit.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVImagine, you being part of a network
p90
aVwhere, you're maybe at a sporting event,
p91
aVand you're sitting in rows like this,
p92
aVand somebody asks for a beer,
p93
aVand it gets handed at the aisle.
p94
aVAnd your neighborly duty
p95
aVis to pass the beer along,
p96
aVat risk to your own trousers,
p97
aVto get it to the destination.
p98
aa(lp99
VNo one pays you to do this.
p100
aVIt's just part of your neighborly duty.
p101
aVAnd, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,
p102
aVsometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,
p103
aVwith the intervening entities
p104
aVthat are passing the data around
p105
aVhaving no particular contractual or legal obligation
p106
aVto the original sender
p107
aVor to the receiver.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.
p110
aVYou need a lot of trust,
p111
aVbut it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."
p112
aVSo the Internet needs addressing and directions.
p113
aVIt turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.
p114
aVInstead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,
p115
aVbut we can only see amidst the fog
p116
aVthe people immediately around us.
p117
aVSo what do we do to figure out who is where?
p118
aVWe turn to the person on the right,
p119
aVand we tell that person what we see on our left,
p120
aVand vice versa.
p121
aVAnd they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,
p122
aVyou have a general sense of where everything is.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.
p125
aVThis is a system that relies on kindness and trust,
p126
aVwhich also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.
p127
aVIn rare but striking instances,
p128
aVa single lie told by just one entity
p129
aVin this honeycomb
p130
aVcan lead to real trouble.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo, for example, last year,
p133
aVthe government of Pakistan
p134
aVasked its Internet service providers there
p135
aVto prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.
p136
aVThere was a video there that the government did not like
p137
aVand they wanted to make sure it was blocked.
p138
aVThis is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere
p139
aVare often trying to block
p140
aVand filter and censor content on the Internet.
p141
aa(lp142
VWell this one ISP in Pakistan
p143
aVchose to effectuate the block for its subscribers
p144
aVin a rather unusual way.
p145
aVIt advertised \u2014
p146
aVthe way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,
p147
aVto declare what you see near you \u2014 it advertised
p148
aVthat near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find
p149
aVthat it was YouTube.
p150
aV"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."
p151
aVWhich meant that packets of data
p152
aVfrom subscribers going to YouTube
p153
aVstopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,
p154
aVand the ISP threw them away unopened
p155
aVbecause the point was to block it.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut it didn't stop there.
p158
aVYou see, that announcement
p159
aVwent one click out,
p160
aVwhich got reverberated, one click out.
p161
aVAnd it turns out that as you look
p162
aVat the postmortem of this event,
p163
aVyou have at one moment
p164
aVperfectly working YouTube.
p165
aVThen, at moment number two,
p166
aVyou have the fake announcement go out.
p167
aVAnd within two minutes,
p168
aVit reverberates around
p169
aVand YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.
p170
aVIf you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,
p171
aVyour packets were going to Pakistan
p172
aVand they weren't coming back.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow just think about that.
p175
aVOne of the most popular websites in the world,
p176
aVrun by the most powerful company in the world,
p177
aVand there was nothing that YouTube or Google
p178
aVwere particularly privileged to do about it.
p179
aVAnd yet, somehow, within about two hours,
p180
aVthe problem was fixed.
p181
aVHow did this happen?
p182
aa(lp183
VWell, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.
p184
aVThe North American Network Operators Group,
p185
aVa group of people who,
p186
aVon a beautiful day outside,
p187
aVenter into a windowless room,
p188
aVat their terminals
p189
aVreading email and messages
p190
aVin fixed proportion font, like this,
p191
aVand they talk about networks.
p192
aVAnd some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers
p193
aVaround the world.
p194
aVAnd here is the message where one of them says,
p195
aV"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!
p196
aVThis is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness
p197
aVof YouTube engineers. I promise.
p198
aVSomething is up in Pakistan."
p199
aVAnd they came together to help find the problem and fix it.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.
p202
aVThe bad news is there is no fire brigade.
p203
aVThe good news is random people apparate from nowhere,
p204
aVput out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aVI was trying to think of the right model to describe
p207
aVthis form of random acts of kindness
p208
aVby geeky strangers.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVYou know, it's just like the hail goes out
p211
aVand people are ready to help.
p212
aVAnd it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.
p213
aa(lp214
VExample number two: Wikipedia.
p215
aVIf a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001
p216
aVand said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles
p217
aVthat anybody can edit anything, at any time,
p218
aVand we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?"
p219
aVRight. Dumbest idea ever.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVIn fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid
p222
aVthat even Jimbo never had it.
p223
aa(lp224
VJimbo's idea was for Nupedia.
p225
aVIt was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money
p226
aVbecause he was feeling like a good guy,
p227
aVand the money would go to the people
p228
aVand they would write the articles.
p229
aVThe wiki was introduced
p230
aVso others could make suggestions on edits \u2014
p231
aVas almost an afterthought, a back room.
p232
aVAnd then it turns out the back room grew
p233
aVto encompass the entire project.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous
p236
aVthat you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVI am not making this up.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aVI have a theory I can explain later.
p241
aVSuffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia
p242
aVstir-fried with pimentos.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VBut now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.
p246
aVHow does it really work? It turns out
p247
aVthere is a back room that is kind of windowless,
p248
aVmetaphorically speaking.
p249
aVAnd there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,
p250
aVwould rather be inside
p251
aVand monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,
p252
aVitself a wiki page that anyone can edit.
p253
aVAnd you just bring your problems to the page.
p254
aVIt's reminiscent of the description of history
p255
aVas "one damn thing after another," right?
p256
aa(lp257
VNumber one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."
p258
aVApologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.
p259
aVI'm not taking sides.
p260
aV"Anon attacking me for reverting."
p261
aVHere is my favorite: "A long story."
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVIt turns out there are more people checking this page for problems
p264
aVand wanting to solve them
p265
aVthan there are problems arising on the page.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.
p268
aVAt all times, Wikipedia is approximately
p269
aV45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?
p270
aVThere are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article
p271
aVinto an ad for a Rolex watch.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVIt's this thin geeky line
p274
aVthat keeps it going.
p275
aVNot because it's a job,
p276
aVnot because it's a career,
p277
aVbut because it's a calling.
p278
aVIt's something they feel impelled to do
p279
aVbecause they care about it.
p280
aa(lp281
VThey even gather together in such groups
p282
aVas the Counter-Vandalism Unit \u2014
p283
aV"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" \u2014
p284
aVto just clean up the pages.
p285
aVIt does make you wonder if there were, for instance,
p286
aVa massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,
p287
aVwho would be minding the store?
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VSo what we see \u2014
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aVwhat we see in this phenomenon
p293
aVis something that the crazed, late traffic engineer
p294
aVHans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,
p295
aVand here in South Kensington, that sometimes
p296
aVif you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,
p297
aVyou can actually end up
p298
aVwith a safer environment in which people can function,
p299
aVand one in which they are more human with each other.
p300
aVThey're realizing that they
p301
aVhave to take responsibility for what they do.
p302
aVAnd Wikipedia has embraced this.
p303
aa(lp304
VSome of you may remember Star Wars Kid,
p305
aVthe poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,
p306
aVacting as if it were a light saber.
p307
aVThe film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,
p308
aVfound its way onto the Internet.
p309
aVHugely viral video. Extremely popular.
p310
aVTotally mortifying to him.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, it being encyclopedic and all,
p313
aVWikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.
p314
aVEvery article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,
p315
aVand on the discussion page
p316
aVthey had extensive argument among the Wikipedians
p317
aVas to whether to have his real name
p318
aVfeatured in the article.
p319
aVYou could see arguments on both sides.
p320
aVHere is just a snapshot of some of them.
p321
aVThey eventually decided \u2014
p322
aVnot unanimously by any means \u2014
p323
aVnot to include his real name,
p324
aVdespite the fact that nearly all media reports did.
p325
aVThey just didn't think it was the right thing to do.
p326
aVIt was an act of kindness.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid
p329
aVhas a warning right at the top
p330
aVthat says you are not to put his real name on the page.
p331
aVIf you do, it will be removed immediately,
p332
aVremoved by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,
p333
aVbut respect the outcome
p334
aVand work to make it stay
p335
aVbecause they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.
p336
aVAs a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law
p337
aVand stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.
p338
aa(lp339
VNow, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.
p340
aVWe see it on blogs all over the place.
p341
aVI mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.
p342
aVWow. Blogs are going to change your business.
p343
aVI know they look silly. And sure they look silly.
p344
aVThey start off on all sorts of goofy projects.
p345
aa(lp346
VThis is my favorite goofy blog:
p347
aVCatsthatlooklikehitler.com.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVYou send in a picture of your cat
p350
aVif it looks like Hitler.
p351
aV(Laughter)
p352
aVYeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine
p353
aVcoming home to that cat everyday?
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VBut then, you can see the same kind of whimsy
p357
aVapplied to people.
p358
aVSo this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.
p359
aVThis one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.
p360
aVIs that an animal carcass behind her?"
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aVYou're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass
p363
aVbehind her."
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd it's one after the other.
p366
aVBut then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.
p367
aVThat's it. Image removed at request of owner.
p368
aVIt turns out that somebody lampooned here
p369
aVwrote to the snarky guy that does the site,
p370
aVnot with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,
p371
aVbut just said, "Hey, would you mind?"
p372
aVThe person said, "No, that's fine."
p373
aa(lp374
VI believe we can build architectures online
p375
aVto make such human requests
p376
aVthat much easier to do,
p377
aVto make it possible for all of us to see
p378
aVthat the data we encounter online
p379
aVis just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward
p380
aVthat actually represents human emotion
p381
aVand endeavor and impact,
p382
aVand to be able to have an ethical moment
p383
aVwhere we decide how we want to treat it.
p384
aa(lp385
VI even think it can go into the real world.
p386
aVWe can end up, as we get in a world with more censors \u2014
p387
aVeverywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online \u2014
p388
aVto be able to have a little clip you could wear
p389
aVthat says, "You know, I'd rather not."
p390
aVAnd then have technology
p391
aVthat the person taking the photo will know later,
p392
aVthis person requested to be contacted
p393
aVbefore this goes anywhere big,
p394
aVif you don't mind.
p395
aVAnd that person taking the photo can make a decision
p396
aVabout how and whether to respect it.
p397
aa(lp398
VIn the real world, we see filtering of this sort
p399
aVtaking place in Pakistan.
p400
aVAnd we now have means that we can build, like this system,
p401
aVso that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.
p402
aVAnd it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,"
p403
aVbut suddenly a collective consciousness
p404
aVabout what is blocked and censored
p405
aVwhere online.
p406
aVIn fact, talk about technology imitating life
p407
aVimitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around.
p408
aa(lp409
VAn NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots
p410
aVwith smiley faces on them,
p411
aVand a motor that just drove them forward
p412
aVand a flag sticking out the back
p413
aVwith a desired destination.
p414
aVIt said, "Can you help me get there?"
p415
aVReleased it on the streets of Manhattan.
p416
aV(Laughter)
p417
aVThey'll fund anything these days.
p418
aVHere is the chart of over 43 people
p419
aVhelping to steer the robot that could not steer
p420
aVand get it on its way, from one corner
p421
aVfrom one corner of Washington Square Park
p422
aVto another.
p423
aa(lp424
VThat leads to example number three: hitchhiking.
p425
aVI'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.
p426
aVWhy? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.
p427
aVIf it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,
p428
aVtumbleweeds would be blowing through it.
p429
aVBut it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.
p430
aVNow why are people using it?
p431
aVI don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?
p432
aV(Laughter)
p433
aVNo. I think the actual answer is
p434
aVthat once you reframe it,
p435
aVonce you get out of one set of stale expectations
p436
aVfrom a failed project that had its day,
p437
aVbut now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,
p438
aVyou can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing
p439
aVthat something like this on Craigslist represents.
p440
aa(lp441
VAnd then you can highlight it
p442
aVinto something like,
p443
aVyes, CouchSurfing.org.
p444
aVCouchSurfing: one guy's idea
p445
aVto, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away
p446
aVand would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,
p447
aVwith people who live far away,
p448
aVand would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.
p449
aVIt's a brilliant idea.
p450
aVIt's a bee that, yes, flies.
p451
aa(lp452
VAmazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.
p453
aVAnd if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities
p454
aVassociated with CouchSurfing.
p455
aVAlthough, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,
p456
aVworks that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,
p457
aVso there may be some selection bias there.
p458
aV(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VSo, my urging, my thought,
p461
aVis that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.
p462
aVIt's not a noun. It's a verb.
p463
aVAnd when you go on it,
p464
aVif you listen and see carefully and closely enough,
p465
aVwhat you will discover
p466
aVis that that information
