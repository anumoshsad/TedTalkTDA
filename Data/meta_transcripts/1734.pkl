VSo I grew up in East Los Angeles,
p4
aVnot even realizing I was poor.
p5
aVMy dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.
p6
aVEveryone knew who I was,
p7
aVso I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,
p8
aVand even though my dad spent most of my life
p9
aVin and out of jail,
p10
aVI had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
p11
aVShe worked at the local high school
p12
aVas a secretary in the dean's office,
p13
aVso she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,
p14
aVfor whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.
p15
aVMan, her office was packed.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with
p18
aVoutside of school,
p19
aVand sometimes we're just not ready to focus.
p20
aVBut that doesn't mean that we can't.
p21
aVIt just takes a little bit more.
p22
aVLike, I remember one day I found my dad
p23
aVconvulsing, foaming at the mouth,
p24
aVOD-ing on the bathroom floor.
p25
aVReally, do you think that doing my homework that night
p26
aVwas at the top of my priority list?
p27
aVNot so much.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut I really needed a support network,
p30
aVa group of people who were going to help me
p31
aVmake sure that I wasn't going to be
p32
aVa victim of my own circumstance,
p33
aVthat they were going to push me
p34
aVbeyond what I even thought I could do.
p35
aVI needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,
p36
aVwho were going to say, "You can move beyond that."
p37
aVAnd unfortunately, the local junior high
p38
aVwas not going to offer that.
p39
aVIt was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo my mom said, "You're going on a bus
p42
aVan hour and a half away from where we live every day."
p43
aVSo for the next two years, that's what I did.
p44
aVI took a school bus to the fancy side of town.
p45
aVAnd eventually, I ended up at a school
p46
aVwhere there was a mixture.
p47
aVThere were some people who were really gang-affiliated,
p48
aVand then there were those of us
p49
aVreally trying to make it to high school.
p50
aVWell, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.
p51
aVYou had to survive.
p52
aVYou just had to do things sometimes.
p53
aVSo there were a lot of teachers who were like,
p54
aV"She's never going to make it.
p55
aVShe has an issue with authority.
p56
aVShe's not going to go anywhere."
p57
aVSome teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut then, they were very surprised
p60
aVwhen I graduated from high school.
p61
aVI was accepted to Pepperdine University,
p62
aVand I came back to the same school that I attended
p63
aVto be a special ed assistant.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd boy, they were like, "What? Why?
p68
aVWhy would you want to do that?"
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I began my teaching career
p71
aVat the exact same middle school that I attended,
p72
aVand I really wanted to try to save more kids
p73
aVwho were just like me.
p74
aVAnd so every year, I share my background with my kids,
p75
aVbecause they need to know that everyone has a story,
p76
aVeveryone has a struggle,
p77
aVand everyone needs help along the way.
p78
aVAnd I am going to be their help along the way.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.
p81
aVI had a kid one day come into my class
p82
aVhaving been stabbed the night before.
p83
aa(lp84
VI was like, "You need to go to a hospital,
p85
aVthe school nurse, something."
p86
aa(lp87
VHe's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.
p88
aVI need to be in class because I need to graduate."
p89
aVSo he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim
p90
aVof his circumstance,
p91
aVbut we were going to push forward and keep moving on.
p92
aVAnd this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids
p93
aVand getting to know exactly what they're going through,
p94
aVgetting to know their families \u2014 I wanted that,
p95
aVbut I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,
p96
aVand teachers turning over year after year after year.
p97
aVHow do you get to build those relationships?
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we created a new school.
p100
aVAnd we created
p101
aVthe San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.
p102
aVAnd we made sure that we were still attached
p103
aVto our school district for funding, for support.
p104
aVBut with that, we were going to gain freedom:
p105
aVfreedom to hire the teachers
p106
aVthat we knew were going to be effective;
p107
aVfreedom to control the curriculum
p108
aVso that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;
p109
aVand freedom to control a budget,
p110
aVto spend money where it matters,
p111
aVnot how a district or a state says you have to do it.
p112
aVWe wanted those freedoms.
p113
aVBut now, shifting an entire paradigm,
p114
aVit hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.
p115
aVBut we had to do it.
p116
aVOur community deserved a new way of doing things.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd as the very first pilot middle school
p119
aVin all of Los Angeles Unified School District,
p120
aVyou better believe there was some opposition.
p121
aVAnd it was out of fear \u2014
p122
aVfear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
p123
aVYeah, what if we get it wrong?
p124
aVBut what if we get it right?
p125
aVAnd we did.
p126
aVSo even though teachers were against it
p127
aVbecause we employ one-year contracts \u2014
p128
aVyou can't teach, or you don't want to teach,
p129
aVyou don't get to be at my school with my kids.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VSo in our third year, how did we do it?
p134
aVWell, we're making school worth coming to every day.
p135
aVWe make our kids feel like they matter to us.
p136
aVWe make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,
p137
aVand they use all the technology that they're used to.
p138
aVLaptops, computers, tablets \u2014 you name it, they have it.
p139
aVAnimation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
p140
aVAnd because we connect it to what they're doing \u2014
p141
aVFor example, they made public service announcements
p142
aVfor the Cancer Society.
p143
aVThese were played in the local trolley system.
p144
aVTeaching elements of persuasion,
p145
aVit doesn't get any more real than that.
p146
aVOur state test scores have gone up
p147
aVmore than 80 points since we've become our own school.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut it's taken all stakeholders, working together \u2014
p150
aVteachers and principals on one-year contracts,
p151
aVworking over and above and beyond their contract hours
p152
aVwithout compensation.
p153
aVAnd it takes a school board member
p154
aVwho is going to lobby for you and say,
p155
aV"Know, the district is trying to impose this,
p156
aVbut you have the freedom to do otherwise."
p157
aVAnd it takes an active parent center
p158
aVwho is not only there, showing a presence every day,
p159
aVbut who is part of our governance,
p160
aVmaking decisions for their kids, our kids.
p161
aa(lp162
VBecause why should our students have to go
p163
aVso far away from where they live?
p164
aVThey deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,
p165
aVa school that they can be proud to say they attend,
p166
aVand a school that the community can be proud of as well,
p167
aVand they need teachers to fight for them every day
p168
aVand empower them to move beyond their circumstances.
p169
aVBecause it's time that kids like me
p170
aVstop being the exception, and we become the norm.
p171
aa(lp172
VThank you.
