VSalaam alaikum.
p4
aVWelcome to Doha.
p5
aVI am in charge of making this country's food secure.
p6
aVThat is my job for the next two years,
p7
aVto design an entire master plan,
p8
aVand then for the next 10 years to implement it \u2014
p9
aVof course, with so many other people.
p10
aVBut first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,
p11
aVabout the story of this country that you're all here in today.
p12
aVAnd of course, most of you have had three meals today,
p13
aVand probably will continue to have after this event.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?
p16
aVWe were about 11,000 people living here.
p17
aVThere was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.
p18
aVMost of the people who lived here
p19
aVeither lived in coastal villages, fishing,
p20
aVor were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.
p21
aVNone of the glamour that you see today existed.
p22
aVNo cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.
p23
aVIt wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.
p24
aVResources weren't there to develop them.
p25
aVAnd you can see that life expectancy was also short.
p26
aVMost people died around the age of 50.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
p29
aV1939, that's when they discovered oil.
p30
aVBut unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially
p31
aVuntil after the Second World War.
p32
aVWhat did it do?
p33
aVIt changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
p34
aVIt also made all those people who roamed around the desert \u2014
p35
aVlooking for water, looking for food,
p36
aVtrying to take care of their livestock \u2014 urbanize.
p37
aa(lp38
VYou might find this strange,
p39
aVbut in my family we have different accents.
p40
aVMy mother has an accent that is so different to my father,
p41
aVand we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.
p42
aVThere are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
p43
aVSomeone says, "How so? How could this happen?"
p44
aVBecause we lived scattered.
p45
aVWe couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.
p46
aVAnd when the resources came, be it oil,
p47
aVwe started building these fancy technologies
p48
aVand bringing people together because we needed the concentration.
p49
aVPeople started to get to know each other.
p50
aVAnd we realized that there are some differences in accents.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo that is the chapter two: the oil era.
p53
aVLet's look at today.
p54
aVThis is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.
p55
aVSo what's the population today?
p56
aVIt's 1.7 million people.
p57
aVThat is in less than 60 years.
p58
aVThe average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.
p59
aVLifespan has increased to 78.
p60
aVWater consumption has increased to 430 liters.
p61
aVAnd this is amongst the highest worldwide.
p62
aVFrom having no water whatsoever
p63
aVto consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.
p64
aVI don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
p67
aVThe interesting part is that we continue to grow
p68
aV15 percent every year for the past five years without water.
p69
aVNow that is historic. It's never happened before in history.
p70
aVCities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.
p71
aVThis is history being made in this region.
p72
aVNot only cities that we're building,
p73
aVbut cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.
p74
aVBuild a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.
p75
aVThese people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.
p76
aVBut of course, with the use of technology.
p77
aVSo Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
p78
aVQatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe question is how.
p81
aVHow could we survive that?
p82
aVWe have no water whatsoever.
p83
aVSimply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
p84
aVEnergy is the key factor here. It changed everything.
p85
aVIt is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,
p86
aVprobably most of you used it coming to Doha.
p87
aVSo that is our lake, if you can see it.
p88
aVThat is our river.
p89
aVThat is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.
p90
aVThis is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo what are the risks?
p93
aVDo you worry much?
p94
aVI would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,
p95
aVyou will realize, of course I have to worry.
p96
aVThere is growing demand, growing population.
p97
aVWe've turned seven billion only a few months ago.
p98
aVAnd so that number also demands food.
p99
aVAnd there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo a country that has no water
p102
aVhas to worry about what happens beyond its borders.
p103
aVThere's also changing diets.
p104
aVBy elevating to a higher socio-economic level,
p105
aVthey also change their diet.
p106
aVThey start eating more meat and so on and so forth.
p107
aVOn the other hand, there is declining yields
p108
aVbecause of climate change and because of other factors.
p109
aVAnd so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.
p112
aVWe only have two days of water reserve.
p113
aVWe import 90 percent of our food,
p114
aVand we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
p115
aVThe limited number of farmers that we have
p116
aVhave been pushed out of their farming practices
p117
aVas a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.
p118
aVSo we also face risks.
p119
aVThese risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe question is, is there a solution?
p122
aVIs there a sustainable solution?
p123
aVIndeed there is.
p124
aVThis slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents
p125
aVthat we've been working on over the past two years.
p126
aVLet's start with the water.
p127
aVSo we know very well \u2014 I showed you earlier \u2014 that we need this energy.
p128
aVSo if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
p129
aVA depletable energy? Fossil fuel?
p130
aVOr should we use something else?
p131
aVDo we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?
p132
aVI guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.
p133
aVAnd so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.
p134
aVAnd we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems
p135
aVto produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
p136
aVAnd that is a lot of water.
p137
aa(lp138
VThat water will go then to the farmers,
p139
aVand the farmers will be able to water their plants,
p140
aVand they will be able then to supply society with food.
p141
aVBut in order to sustain the horizontal line \u2014
p142
aVbecause these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver \u2014
p143
aVwe need to also develop the vertical line:
p144
aVsystem sustenance, high-level education, research and development,
p145
aVindustries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.
p146
aVBut what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.
p147
aVWithout it we can't do anything.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo that's what we are planning to do.
p150
aVWithin two years we should hopefully be done with this plan
p151
aVand taking it to implementation.
p152
aVOur objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:
p153
aVIstanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.
p154
aVWe are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever
p155
aVas a city, to live in peace.
p156
aa(lp157
VThank you very much.
