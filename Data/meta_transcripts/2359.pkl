VI would like to invite you
p4
aVto come along on a visit
p5
aVto a dark continent.
p6
aVIt is the continent hidden
p7
aVunder the surface of the earth.
p8
aVIt is largely unexplored,
p9
aVpoorly understood, and the stuff of legends.
p10
aVBut it is made also of dramatic landscapes
p11
aVlike this huge underground chamber,
p12
aVand it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds.
p13
aa(lp14
VThanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries \u2014
p15
aVactually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course \u2014
p16
aVwe know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface.
p17
aVHowever, we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth.
p18
aVBecause a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,
p19
aVthe potential of cave exploration \u2014 the geographical dimension \u2014
p20
aVis poorly understood and unappreciated.
p21
aVBecause we are creatures living on the surface,
p22
aVour perception of the inner side of the planet
p23
aVis in some ways skewed,
p24
aVas is that of the depth of the oceans
p25
aVor of the upper atmosphere.
p26
aa(lp27
VHowever, since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago,
p28
aVwe know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world.
p29
aVA single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,
p30
aVcan be as long as more than 600 kilometers.
p31
aVAnd an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region,
p32
aVactually the deepest cave explored in the world,
p33
aVcan go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface.
p34
aVThat means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer.
p35
aa(lp36
VCaves form in karstic regions.
p37
aVSo karstic regions are areas of the world
p38
aVwhere the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures,
p39
aVcan easily dissolve soluble lithologies,
p40
aVforming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits \u2014
p41
aVa three-dimensional network, actually.
p42
aVKarstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface,
p43
aVand we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years
p44
aVhave explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world,
p45
aVwhich is a big number.
p46
aVBut geologists have estimated that what is still missing,
p47
aVto be discovered and mapped,
p48
aVis something around 10 million kilometers.
p49
aa(lp50
VThat means that for each meter of a cave that we already know,
p51
aVthat we have explored,
p52
aVthere are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages.
p53
aVThat means that this is really an endless continent,
p54
aVand we will never be able to explore it completely.
p55
aVAnd this estimation is made without considering other types of caves,
p56
aVlike, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves,
p57
aVwhich are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows.
p58
aVAnd if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars,
p59
aVyou will see that this characteristic
p60
aVis not so specific of our home planet.
p61
aVHowever, I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars
p62
aVto explore alien worlds.
p63
aa(lp64
VI'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer.
p65
aVAnd I started with this passion when I was really young
p66
aVin the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy,
p67
aVin the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites.
p68
aVBut soon, the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner
p69
aVof the planet, searching for new potential entrances
p70
aVof this undiscovered continent.
p71
aVAnd in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains,
p72
aVwhich are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins.
p73
aVThese massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them.
p74
aVThey are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls
p75
aVwith silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest.
p76
aVThey really inspired in me a sense of wilderness,
p77
aVwith a soul older than millions and millions of years.
p78
aVAnd this dramatic landscape inspired among other things
p79
aValso Conan Doyle's "The Lost World" novel in 1912.
p80
aVAnd they are, really, a lost world.
p81
aVScientists consider those mountains as islands in time,
p82
aVbeing separated from the surrounding lowlands
p83
aVsince tens of millions of years ago.
p84
aVThey are surrounded by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,
p85
aVresembling a fortress, impregnable by humans.
p86
aVAnd, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed
p87
aVand explored on their top.
p88
aa(lp89
VThese mountains contain also a scientific paradox:
p90
aVThey are made by quartz,
p91
aVwhich is a very common mineral on the earth's crust,
p92
aVand the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite,
p93
aVand quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth.
p94
aVSo we do not expect at all to find a cave there.
p95
aVDespite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy,
p96
aVSlovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,
p97
aVhave explored several caves in this area.
p98
aVSo how can it be possible?
p99
aa(lp100
VTo understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor,
p101
aVbecause the history of the tepuis is extremely long,
p102
aVstarting about 1.6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock,
p103
aVand then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago,
p104
aVafter the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent
p105
aVand the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.
p106
aVSo you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years
p107
aVto sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces,
p108
aVbut also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities,
p109
aVfields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis.
p110
aVBut nobody could have imagined
p111
aVwhat was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs,
p114
aVthe Auyán-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls,
p115
aVwhich is the highest waterfall in the world \u2014
p116
aVabout 979 meters of vertical drop.
p117
aVAnd I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems
p118
aVthrough satellite images,
p119
aVand finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface \u2014
p120
aVso, big boulders, rock piles \u2014
p121
aVand that means that there was a void below.
p122
aVIt was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo we did several attempts to reach this area,
p125
aVby land and with a helicopter,
p126
aVbut it was really difficult because \u2014 you have to imagine
p127
aVthat these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year, by fog.
p128
aVThere are strong winds,
p129
aVand there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year,
p130
aVso it's really, really difficult to find good conditions.
p131
aVAnd only in 2013 we finally landed on the spot
p132
aVand we started the exploration of the cave.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe cave is huge.
p135
aVIt's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau,
p136
aVand in only ten days of expedition,
p137
aVwe explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages.
p138
aVAnd it's a huge network of underground rivers,
p139
aVchannels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo it's really an incredible place.
p142
aVAnd we named it Imawarì Yeuta.
p143
aVThat means, in the Pemón indigenous language, "The House of the Gods."
p144
aVYou have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there.
p145
aVIt was impossible for them to reach this area.
p146
aVHowever, there were legends about the existence
p147
aVof a cave in the mountain.
p148
aVSo when we started the exploration,
p149
aVwe had to explore with a great respect,
p150
aVboth because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people,
p151
aVbut also because it was really a sacred place,
p152
aVbecause no human had entered there before.
p153
aVSo we had to use special protocols
p154
aVto not contaminate the environment with our presence,
p155
aVand we tried also to share with the community,
p156
aVwith the indigenous community, our discoveries.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past.
p159
aVThe time needed for their formation
p160
aVcould be as long as 50 or even 100 million years,
p161
aVwhich makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth.
p162
aVWhat you can find there is really evidence of a lost world.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhen you enter a quartzite cave,
p165
aVyou have to completely forget what you know about caves \u2014
p166
aVclassic limestone caves or the touristic caves
p167
aVthat you can visit in several places in the world.
p168
aVBecause what seems a simple stalactite here
p169
aVis not made by calcium carbonate, but is made by opal,
p170
aVand one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed.
p171
aVBut you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica
p172
aVgrowing on a boulder.
p173
aVAnd you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave.
p174
aVWe were the first entering and discovering those unknown things,
p175
aVthings like those monster eggs.
p176
aVAnd we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery,
p177
aVand we didn't want to find a dinosaur.
p178
aVWe didn't find a dinosaur.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnyway, actually, we know that this kind of formation,
p183
aVafter several studies,
p184
aVwe know that these kinds of formations are living organisms.
p185
aVThey are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures
p186
aVresembling stromatolites.
p187
aVStromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth.
p188
aVAnd here in the tepuis,
p189
aVthe interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved
p190
aVin complete isolation from the external surface,
p191
aVand without being in contact with humans.
p192
aVThey have never been in contact with humans.
p193
aVSo the implications for science are enormous,
p194
aVbecause here you could find, for example, microbes
p195
aVthat could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine,
p196
aVor you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties.
p197
aVAnd, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science,
p198
aVwhich is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket,
p201
aVhas evolved in the dark in complete isolation.
p202
aVAnd, really, everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections
p203
aVbetween the biological and the mineralogical world.
p204
aVSo as we explore this dark continent
p205
aVand discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness,
p206
aVwe will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet
p207
aVand on the relationship and evolution of life
p208
aVin relationship with the mineral world.
p209
aVWhat seems only a dark, empty environment
p210
aVcould be in reality a chest of wonders
p211
aVfull of useful information.
p212
aa(lp213
VWith a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists,
p214
aVwhich is called La Venta Teraphosa,
p215
aVwe will be back soon to Latin America,
p216
aVbecause we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon.
p217
aVThere are still very unknown mountains,
p218
aVlike Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level,
p219
aVor Aracà, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil.
p220
aVAnd we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems,
p221
aVand each one with its own undiscovered world.
p222
aa(lp223
VThank you.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget.
p228
aVFrancesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life,
p229
aVand indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia
p230
aVand you were training European astronauts.
p231
aVSo what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?
p232
aa(lp233
VFrancesco Sauro: Yeah, we are \u2014 it's a program of training
p234
aVfor not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.
p235
aVSo they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation.
p236
aVThey have to work together in a real, real dangerous environment,
p237
aVand it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual.
p238
aVIt's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks.
p239
aVAnd it's very similar to a journey to Mars
p240
aVor the International Space Station.
p241
aa(lp242
VBG: In principle. FS: Yes.
p243
aa(lp244
VBG: I want to go back to one of the pictures
p245
aVthat was in your slide show,
p246
aVand it's just representative of the other photos \u2014
p247
aa(lp248
VWeren't those photos amazing? Yeah?
p249
aa(lp250
VAudience: Yeah!
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VFS: I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta,
p255
aVbecause all of those photos are from the photographers.
p256
aa(lp257
VBG: You bring, actually, photographers with you in the expedition.
p258
aVThey're professionals, they're speleologists and photographers.
p259
aVBut when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there,
p260
aVand yet they look incredibly well-exposed.
p261
aVHow do you take these pictures?
p262
aVHow do your colleagues, the photographers, take these pictures?
p263
aa(lp264
VFS: Yeah. They are working in a darkroom, basically,
p265
aVso you can open the shutter of the camera
p266
aVand use the lights to paint the environment.
p267
aa(lp268
VBG: So you're basically \u2014
p269
aa(lp270
VFS: Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute
p271
aVand then paint the environment.
p272
aVThe final result is what you want to achieve.
p273
aa(lp274
VBG: You spray the environment with light and that's what you get.
p275
aVMaybe we can try this at home someday, I don't know.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VBG: Francesco, grazie. FS: Grazie.
