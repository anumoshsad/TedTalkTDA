VMy son and the iPhone were born three weeks apart
p4
aVin June 2007.
p5
aVSo while those early adopters were lined up outside,
p6
aVwaiting to get their hands on this amazing new gadget,
p7
aVI was stuck at home with my hands full of something else
p8
aVthat was sending out constant notifications \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
Va miserable, colicky baby
p13
aVwho would only sleep in a moving stroller with complete silence.
p14
aVI literally was walking 10 to 15 miles a day,
p15
aVand the baby weight came off.
p16
aVThat part was great.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut man, was I bored.
p19
aVBefore motherhood, I had been a journalist
p20
aVwho rushed off when the Concorde crashed.
p21
aVI was one of the first people into Belgrade
p22
aVwhen there was a revolution in Serbia.
p23
aVNow, I was exhausted.
p24
aVThis walking went on for weeks.
p25
aVIt was only until about three months in that something shifted, though.
p26
aVAs I pounded the pavement,
p27
aVmy mind started to wander, too.
p28
aVI began imagining what I would do when I finally did sleep again.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo the colic did fade,
p31
aVand I finally got an iPhone
p32
aVand I put all those hours of wandering into action.
p33
aVI created my dream job hosting a public radio show.
p34
aVSo there was no more rushing off to war zones,
p35
aVbut thanks to my new smartphone,
p36
aVI could be a mother and a journalist.
p37
aVI could be on the playground and on Twitter at the same time.
p38
aVYeah, well, when I thought that,
p39
aVwhen the technology came in and took over,
p40
aVthat is when I hit a wall.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, I want you to picture this:
p43
aVyou host a podcast, and you have to prove
p44
aVthat the investment of precious public radio dollars in you
p45
aVis worth it.
p46
aVMy goal was to increase my audience size tenfold.
p47
aVSo one day, I sat down to brainstorm,
p48
aVas you do,
p49
aVand I came up barren.
p50
aVThis was different than writer's block, right?
p51
aVIt wasn't like there was something there waiting to be unearthed.
p52
aVThere was just nothing.
p53
aVAnd so I started to think back:
p54
aVWhen was the last time I actually had a good idea?
p55
aVYeah, it was when I was pushing that damn stroller.
p56
aVNow all the cracks in my day were filled with phone time.
p57
aVI checked the headlines while I waited for my latte.
p58
aVI updated my calendar while I was sitting on the couch.
p59
aVTexting turned every spare moment
p60
aVinto a chance to show to my coworkers and my dear husband
p61
aVwhat a responsive person I was,
p62
aVor at least it was a chance to find another perfect couch
p63
aVfor my page on Pinterest.
p64
aVI realized that I was never bored.
p65
aVAnd anyway, don't only boring people get bored?
p66
aa(lp67
VBut then I started to wonder:
p68
aVWhat actually happens to us when we get bored?
p69
aVOr, more importantly: What happens to us if we never get bored?
p70
aVAnd what could happen if we got rid of this human emotion entirely?
p71
aVI started talking to neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists,
p72
aVand what they told me was fascinating.
p73
aVIt turns out that when you get bored,
p74
aVyou ignite a network in your brain called the "default mode."
p75
aVSo our body, it goes on autopilot while we're folding the laundry
p76
aVor we're walking to work,
p77
aVbut actually that is when our brain gets really busy.
p78
aVHere's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann: Once you start daydreaming
p81
aVand allow your mind to really wander,
p82
aVyou start thinking a little bit beyond the conscious,
p83
aVa little bit into the subconscious,
p84
aVwhich allows sort of different connections to take place.
p85
aVIt's really awesome, actually.
p86
aa(lp87
VManoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?
p88
aa(lp89
VSo this is my brain in an fMRI,
p90
aVand I learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas,
p91
aVwe solve some of our most nagging problems,
p92
aVand we do something called "autobiographical planning."
p93
aVThis is when we look back at our lives,
p94
aVwe take note of the big moments, we create a personal narrative,
p95
aVand then we set goals
p96
aVand we figure out what steps we need to take to reach them.
p97
aVBut now we chill out on the couch also while updating a Google Doc
p98
aVor replying to email.
p99
aVWe call it "getting shit done,"
p100
aVbut here's what neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin says
p101
aVwe're actually doing.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin: Every time you shift your attention
p104
aVfrom one thing to another,
p105
aVthe brain has to engage a neurochemical switch
p106
aVthat uses up nutrients in the brain to accomplish that.
p107
aVSo if you're attempting to multitask,
p108
aVyou know, doing four or five things at once,
p109
aVyou're not actually doing four or five things at once,
p110
aVbecause the brain doesn't work that way.
p111
aVInstead, you're rapidly shifting from one thing to the next,
p112
aVdepleting neural resources as you go.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch, you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have a limited supply of that stuff.
p117
aa(lp118
VMZ: A decade ago, we shifted our attention at work
p119
aVevery three minutes.
p120
aVNow we do it every 45 seconds,
p121
aVand we do it all day long.
p122
aVThe average person checks email 74 times a day,
p123
aVand switches tasks on their computer
p124
aV566 times a day.
p125
aVI discovered all this talking to professor of informatics,
p126
aVDr. Gloria Mark.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find that when people are stressed,
p129
aVthey tend to shift their attention more rapidly.
p130
aVWe also found, strangely enough,
p131
aVthat the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets,
p132
aVthe more likely they are to check Facebook.
p133
aVSo we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.
p134
aa(lp135
VMZ: But could this cycle be broken?
p136
aVWhat would happen if we broke this vicious cycle?
p137
aVMaybe my listeners could help me find out.
p138
aVWhat if we reclaimed those cracks in our day?
p139
aVCould it help us jump-start our creativity?
p140
aVWe called the project "Bored and Brilliant."
p141
aVAnd I expected, you know, a couple hundred people to play along,
p142
aVbut thousands of people started signing up.
p143
aVAnd they told me the reason they were doing it
p144
aVwas because they were worried that their relationship with their phone
p145
aVhad grown kind of ... "codependent," shall we say.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Audio) Man: The relationship between a baby and its teddy bear
p148
aVor a baby and its binky
p149
aVor a baby that wants its mother's cradle
p150
aVwhen it's done with being held by a stranger \u2014
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughs)
p153
aa(lp154
Vthat's the relationship between me and my phone.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone like a power tool:
p157
aVextremely useful, but dangerous if I'm not handling it properly.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Audio) Woman 2: If I don't pay close attention,
p160
aVI'll suddenly realize that I've lost an hour of time
p161
aVdoing something totally mindless.
p162
aa(lp163
VMZ: OK, but to really measure any improvement,
p164
aVwe needed data, right?
p165
aVBecause that's what we do these days.
p166
aVSo we partnered with some apps that would measure how much time
p167
aVwe were spending every day on our phone.
p168
aVIf you're thinking it's ironic
p169
aVthat I asked people to download another app
p170
aVso that they would spend less time on their phones:
p171
aVyeah, but you gotta meet people where they are.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VSo before challenge week,
p176
aVwe were averaging two hours a day on our phones
p177
aVand 60 pickups,
p178
aVyou know, like, a quick check, did I get a new email?
p179
aVHere's what Tina, a student at Bard College,
p180
aVdiscovered about herself.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending
p183
aVbetween 150 and 200 minutes on my phone per day,
p184
aVand I've been picking up my phone 70 to 100 times per day.
p185
aVAnd it's really concerning,
p186
aVbecause that's so much time that I could have spent
p187
aVdoing something more productive, more creative, more towards myself,
p188
aVbecause when I'm on my phone, I'm not doing anything important.
p189
aa(lp190
VMZ: Like Tina, people were starting to observe their own behavior.
p191
aVThey were getting ready for challenge week.
p192
aVAnd that Monday,
p193
aVthey started to wake up to instructions in their inbox,
p194
aVan experiment to try.
p195
aa(lp196
VDay one:
p197
aV"Put it in your pocket."
p198
aVTake that phone out of your hand.
p199
aVSee if you can eliminate the reflex to check it all day long,
p200
aVjust for a day.
p201
aVAnd if this sounds easy,
p202
aVyou haven't tried it.
p203
aVHere's listener Amanda Itzko.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Audio) Amanda Itzko: I am absolutely itching.
p206
aVI feel a little bit crazy,
p207
aVbecause I have noticed that I pick up my phone
p208
aVwhen I'm just walking from one room to another,
p209
aVgetting on the elevator,
p210
aVand even \u2014 and this is the part that I am really embarrassed
p211
aVto actually say out loud \u2014
p212
aVin the car.
p213
aa(lp214
VMZ: Yikes.
p215
aVYeah, well, but as Amanda learned,
p216
aVthis itching feeling is not actually her fault.
p217
aVThat is exactly the behavior that the technology is built to trigger.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VI mean, right?
p222
aVHere's former Google designer, Tristan Harris.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,
p225
aVI have literally a thousand engineers
p226
aVwhose job is to get more attention from you.
p227
aVI'm very good at this,
p228
aVand I don't want you to ever stop.
p229
aVAnd you know, the CEO of Netflix recently said,
p230
aV"Our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."
p231
aVI mean, so there's a million places to spend your attention,
p232
aVbut there's a war going on to get it.
p233
aa(lp234
VMZ: I mean, you know the feeling:
p235
aVthat amazing episode of "Transparent" ends,
p236
aVand then the next one starts playing
p237
aVso you're like, eh, OK fine, I'll just stay up and watch it.
p238
aVOr the LinkedIn progress bar says you are this close
p239
aVto having the perfect profile,
p240
aVso you add a little more personal information.
p241
aVAs one UX designer told me,
p242
aVthe only people who refer to their customers as "users"
p243
aVare drug dealers and technologists.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd users, as we know, are worth a lot of money.
p250
aVHere's former Facebook product manager and author,
p251
aVAntonio García Martínez.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Audio) Antonio García Martínez: The saying is, if any product is free
p254
aVthen you're the product; your attention is the product.
p255
aVBut what is your attention worth?
p256
aVThat's why literally every time you load a page,
p257
aVnot just on Facebook or any app,
p258
aVthere's an auction being held instantly, billions of times a day,
p259
aVfor exactly how much that one ad impression cost.
p260
aa(lp261
VMZ: By the way, the average person will spend two years of their life
p262
aVon Facebook.
p263
aVSo, back to challenge week.
p264
aVImmediately, we saw some creativity kick in.
p265
aVHere's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.
p268
aVSo I suddenly looked at the stairway that went up to the top of the station,
p269
aVand I thought, you know,
p270
aVI had just come down that stairway, but I could go back up
p271
aVand then come back down and get a little cardio.
p272
aVSo I did,
p273
aVand then I had a little more time, so I did it again and I did it again,
p274
aVand I did it 10 times.
p275
aVAnd I had a complete cardio workout.
p276
aVI got on that R train feeling kind of exhausted,
p277
aVbut, like, wow, that had never occurred to me.
p278
aVHow is that possible?
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VMZ: So creativity, I learned, means different things to different people.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VBut everyone found day three's challenge the hardest.
p287
aVIt was called "Delete that app."
p288
aVTake that app \u2014 you know the one;
p289
aVthat one that always gets you, it sucks you in \u2014
p290
aVtake it off your phone,
p291
aVeven if just for the day.
p292
aVI deleted the game Two Dots and nearly cried.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VYeah, Two Dots players know what I'm talking about.
p297
aVBut my misery had good company.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam in Los Angeles,
p300
aVand I deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine
p301
aVfrom my phone
p302
aVin one fell swoop.
p303
aVAnd it was kind of an embarrassingly emotional experience at first.
p304
aVIt felt weirdly lonely to look at that lock screen
p305
aVwith no new notifications on it.
p306
aVBut I really liked deciding for myself
p307
aVwhen to think about or access my social networks,
p308
aVnot giving my phone the power to decide that for me.
p309
aVSo thank you.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app was very sad,
p312
aVand I feel I maybe, over the last year when I've been on Twitter,
p313
aVhave developed an addiction to it,
p314
aVand this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge has really made me realize it.
p315
aVAfter a brief period of really horrible withdrawal feeling,
p316
aVlike lack-of-caffeine headache,
p317
aVI now feel lovely.
p318
aVI had a lovely dinner with my family,
p319
aVand I hope to continue this structured use of these powerful tools.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have that guilty gut feeling
p322
aVI have when I know I'm wasting time on my phone.
p323
aVMaybe I'll have to start giving myself challenges and reminders like this
p324
aVevery morning.
p325
aa(lp326
VMZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.
p327
aVI could not wait to see what the numbers said
p328
aVat the end of that week.
p329
aVBut when the data came in,
p330
aVit turned out that we had cut down,
p331
aVon average,
p332
aVjust six minutes \u2014
p333
aVfrom 120 minutes a day on our phones
p334
aVto 114.
p335
aVYeah. Whoop-de-do.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo I went back to the scientists feeling kind of low,
p338
aVand they just laughed at me,
p339
aVand they said, you know, changing people's behavior
p340
aVin such a short time period
p341
aVwas ridiculously ambitious,
p342
aVand actually what you've achieved is far beyond what we thought possible.
p343
aVBecause more important than the numbers, were the people's stories.
p344
aVThey felt empowered.
p345
aVTheir phones had been transformed
p346
aVfrom taskmasters
p347
aVback into tools.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd actually, I found what the young people said most intriguing.
p350
aVSome of them told me
p351
aVthat they didn't recognize some of the emotions
p352
aVthat they felt during challenge week,
p353
aVbecause, if you think about it,
p354
aVif you have never known life without connectivity,
p355
aVyou may never have experienced boredom.
p356
aVAnd there could be consequences.
p357
aVResearchers at USC have found \u2014 they're studying teenagers
p358
aVwho are on social media while they're talking to their friends
p359
aVor they're doing homework,
p360
aVand two years down the road, they are less creative and imaginative
p361
aVabout their own personal futures
p362
aVand about solving societal problems, like violence in their neighborhoods.
p363
aVAnd we really need this next generation
p364
aVto be able to focus on some big problems:
p365
aVclimate change, economic disparity,
p366
aVmassive cultural differences.
p367
aVNo wonder CEOs in an IBM survey
p368
aVidentified creativity as the number one leadership competency.
p369
aa(lp370
VOK, here's the good news, though:
p371
aVIn the end, 20,000 people did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.
p372
aVNinety percent cut down on their minutes.
p373
aVSeventy percent got more time to think.
p374
aVPeople told me that they slept better.
p375
aVThey felt happier.
p376
aVMy favorite note was from a guy who said he felt like he was waking up
p377
aVfrom a mental hibernation.
p378
aa(lp379
VSome personal data and some neuroscience
p380
aVgave us permission to be offline a little bit more,
p381
aVand a little bit of boredom gave us some clarity
p382
aVand helped some of us set some goals.
p383
aVI mean, maybe constant connectivity
p384
aVwon't be cool in a couple of years.
p385
aVBut meanwhile, teaching people, especially kids,
p386
aVhow to use technology to improve their lives
p387
aVand to self-regulate
p388
aVneeds to be part of digital literacy.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo the next time you go to check your phone,
p391
aVremember that if you don't decide how you're going to use the technology,
p392
aVthe platforms will decide for you.
p393
aVAnd ask yourself:
p394
aVWhat am I really looking for?
p395
aVBecause if it's to check email, that's fine \u2014 do it and be done.
p396
aVBut if it's to distract yourself from doing the hard work
p397
aVthat comes with deeper thinking,
p398
aVtake a break,
p399
aVstare out the window
p400
aVand know that by doing nothing
p401
aVyou are actually being your most productive and creative self.
p402
aVIt might feel weird and uncomfortable at first,
p403
aVbut boredom truly can lead to brilliance.
p404
aa(lp405
VThank you.
