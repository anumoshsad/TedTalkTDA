VNamaskar.
p4
aa(lp5
VI'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,
p6
aVand I don't use Botox as yet.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies.
p11
aVYeah, I do that.
p12
aVI sell dreams, and I peddle love to millions of people back home in India
p13
aVwho assume that I'm the best lover in the world.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIf you don't tell anyone, I'm going to tell you I'm not,
p18
aVbut I never let that assumption go away.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VI've also been made to understand
p23
aVthere are lots of you here who haven't seen my work,
p24
aVand I feel really sad for you.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VThat doesn't take away from the fact that I'm completely self-obsessed,
p31
aVas a movie star should be.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VThat's when my friends, Chris and Juliet called me here
p36
aVto speak about the future "you."
p37
aVNaturally, it follows I'm going to speak about the present me.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VBecause I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VIt is. It is.
p46
aVIt's an aging movie star,
p47
aVgrappling with all the newness around itself,
p48
aVwondering whether it got it right in the first place,
p49
aVand still trying to find a way
p50
aVto keep on shining regardless.
p51
aa(lp52
VI was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of India, New Delhi.
p53
aVAnd my father was a freedom fighter.
p54
aVMy mother was, well, just a fighter like mothers are.
p55
aVAnd much like the original homo sapiens,
p56
aVwe struggled to survive.
p57
aVWhen I was in my early 20s,
p58
aVI lost both my parents,
p59
aVwhich I must admit seems a bit careless of me now,
p60
aVbut \u2014
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VI do remember the night my father died,
p65
aVand I remember the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital.
p66
aVHe mumbled something about "dead people don't tip so well"
p67
aVand walked away into the dark.
p68
aVAnd I was only 14 then,
p69
aVand I put my father's dead body in the back seat of the car,
p70
aVand my mother besides me,
p71
aVI started driving back from the hospital to the house.
p72
aVAnd in the middle of her quiet crying, my mother looked at me and she said,
p73
aV"Son, when did you learn to drive?"
p74
aVAnd I thought about it and realized, and I said to my mom,
p75
aV"Just now, Mom."
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VSo from that night onwards,
p80
aVmuch akin to humanity in its adolescence,
p81
aVI learned the crude tools of survival.
p82
aVAnd the framework of life was very, very simple then, to be honest.
p83
aVYou know, you just ate what you got
p84
aVand did whatever you were told to do.
p85
aVI thought celiac was a vegetable,
p86
aVand vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's lost comrade in "Star Trek."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VYou married the first girl that you dated,
p91
aVand you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car.
p92
aVI really thought that gay was a sophisticated English word for happy.
p93
aVAnd Lesbian, of course, was the capital of Portugal, as you all know.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VWhere was I?
p98
aVWe relied on systems
p99
aVcreated through the toil and sacrifice of generations before
p100
aVto protect us,
p101
aVand we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment.
p102
aVScience was simple and logical,
p103
aVApple was still then just a fruit
p104
aVowned by Eve first and then Newton,
p105
aVnot by Steve Jobs, until then.
p106
aVAnd "Eureka!" was what you screamed
p107
aVwhen you wanted to run naked on the streets.
p108
aVYou went wherever life took you for work,
p109
aVand people were mostly welcoming of you.
p110
aVMigration was a term then
p111
aVstill reserved for Siberian cranes, not human beings.
p112
aVMost importantly, you were who you were
p113
aVand you said what you thought.
p114
aa(lp115
VThen in my late 20s,
p116
aVI shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai,
p117
aVand my framework,
p118
aVlike the newly industrialized aspirational humanity,
p119
aVbegan to alter.
p120
aVIn the urban rush for a new, more embellished survival,
p121
aVthings started to look a little different.
p122
aVI met people who had descended from all over the world,
p123
aVfaces, races, genders, money-lenders.
p124
aVDefinitions became more and more fluid.
p125
aVWork began to define you at that time
p126
aVin an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,
p127
aVand all the systems started to feel less reliable to me,
p128
aValmost too thick to hold on
p129
aVto the diversity of mankind
p130
aVand the human need to progress and grow.
p131
aVIdeas were flowing with more freedom and speed.
p132
aVAnd I experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation,
p133
aVand my own creativity,
p134
aVwhen supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor,
p135
aVcatapulted me into superstardom.
p136
aa(lp137
VI started to feel that I had arrived,
p138
aVand generally, by the time I was 40, I was really, really flying.
p139
aVI was all over the place.
p140
aVYou know? I'd done 50 films by then
p141
aVand 200 songs,
p142
aVand I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.
p143
aVI had been given the highest civil honor by the French government,
p144
aVthe title of which for the life of me I can't pronounce even until now.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VI'm sorry, France, and thank you, France, for doing that.
p149
aVBut much bigger than that, I got to meet Angelina Jolie \u2014
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
Vfor two and a half seconds.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd I'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere.
p158
aVOK, maybe not.
p159
aVAnd I sat next to Hannah Montana on a round dinner table
p160
aVwith her back towards me most of the time.
p161
aVLike I said, I was flying, from Miley to Jolie,
p162
aVand humanity was soaring with me.
p163
aVWe were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then you all know what happened.
p166
aVThe internet happened.
p167
aVI was in my late 40s,
p168
aVand I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage
p169
aVand assuming that, you know, people who peered into my world
p170
aVwould admire it
p171
aVfor the miracle I believed it to be.
p172
aVBut something else awaited me and humanity.
p173
aVYou know, we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams
p174
aVwith the enhanced connectivity of the world.
p175
aVWe had not bargained for the village-like enclosure of thought,
p176
aVof judgment, of definition
p177
aVthat flowed from the same place
p178
aVthat freedom and revolution was taking place in.
p179
aVEverything I said took a new meaning.
p180
aVEverything I did \u2014 good, bad, ugly \u2014
p181
aVwas there for the world to comment upon and judge.
p182
aVAs a matter of fact, everything I didn't say or do also
p183
aVmet with the same fate.
p184
aa(lp185
VFour years ago,
p186
aVmy lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child.
p187
aVIt was claimed on the net
p188
aVthat he was the love child
p189
aVof our first child
p190
aVwho was 15 years old.
p191
aVApparently, he had sown his wild oats with a girl
p192
aVwhile driving her car in Romania.
p193
aVAnd yeah, there was a fake video to go with it.
p194
aVAnd we were so disturbed as a family.
p195
aVMy son, who is 19 now,
p196
aVeven now when you say "hello" to him,
p197
aVhe just turns around and says,
p198
aV"But bro, I didn't even have a European driving license."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VYeah.
p203
aVIn this new world,
p204
aVslowly, reality became virtual and virtual became real,
p205
aVand I started to feel
p206
aVthat I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought,
p207
aVand humanity at this time
p208
aVcompletely identified with me.
p209
aVI think both of us were going through our midlife crisis,
p210
aVand humanity, like me, was becoming an overexposed prima donna.
p211
aVI started to sell everything,
p212
aVfrom hair oil to diesel generators.
p213
aVHumanity was buying everything
p214
aVfrom crude oil to nuclear reactors.
p215
aVYou know, I even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit
p216
aVto reinvent myself.
p217
aVI must admit I failed miserably.
p218
aVAnd just an aside I want to say on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men
p219
aVand Supermen of the world,
p220
aVyou have to commend them,
p221
aVbecause it really hurts in the crotch, that superhero suit.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VYeah, I'm being honest. I need to tell you this here.
p226
aVReally.
p227
aVAnd accidentally, I happened to even invent a new dance form
p228
aVwhich I didn't realize, and it became a rage.
p229
aVSo if it's all right,
p230
aVand you've seen a bit of me, so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.
p231
aVIt was called the Lungi dance.
p232
aVSo if it's all right, I'll just show you. I'm talented otherwise.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Cheers)
p235
aa(lp236
VSo it went something like this.
p237
aa(lp238
VLungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
p239
aVLungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
p240
aVLungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi.
p241
aa(lp242
VThat's it. It became a rage.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Cheers)
p245
aa(lp246
VIt really did.
p247
aVLike you notice, nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me,
p248
aVand I didn't give a damn, really,
p249
aVbecause the whole world, and whole humanity,
p250
aVseemed as confused and lost as I was.
p251
aVI didn't give up then.
p252
aVI even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media
p253
aVlike everyone else does.
p254
aVI thought if I put on philosophical tweets out there
p255
aVpeople will think I'm with it,
p256
aVbut some of the responses I got from those tweets
p257
aVwere extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand. You know?
p258
aVROFL, LOL.
p259
aV"Adidas," somebody wrote back to one of my more thought-provoking tweets
p260
aVand I was wondering why would you name a sneaker,
p261
aVI mean, why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me?
p262
aVAnd I asked my 16-year-old daughter, and she enlightened me.
p263
aV"Adidas" now means "All day I dream about sex."
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VReally.
p268
aVI didn't know if you know that.
p269
aVSo I wrote back, "WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,
p270
aVthanking secretly that some acronyms and things won't change at all.
p271
aVWTF.
p272
aa(lp273
VBut here we are.
p274
aVI am 51 years old, like I told you,
p275
aVand mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,
p276
aVI just want to tell you
p277
aVif there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist,
p278
aVit is now,
p279
aVbecause the present you is brave.
p280
aVThe present you is hopeful.
p281
aVThe present you is innovative and resourceful,
p282
aVand of course, the present you is annoyingly indefinable.
p283
aVAnd in this spell-binding,
p284
aVimperfect moment of existence,
p285
aVfeeling a little brave just before I came here,
p286
aVI decided to take a good, hard look at my face.
p287
aVAnd I realized that I'm beginning to look more and more
p288
aVlike the wax statue of me at Madame Tussaud's.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VYeah, and in that moment of realization,
p293
aVI asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me:
p294
aVDo I need to fix my face?
p295
aVReally. I'm an actor, like I told you,
p296
aVa modern expression of human creativity.
p297
aVThe land I come from
p298
aVis the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality.
p299
aVIn its immense generosity,
p300
aVIndia decided somehow
p301
aVthat I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter
p302
aVwho accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams,
p303
aVshould become its king of romance,
p304
aVthe "Badhshah of Bollywood,"
p305
aVthe greatest lover the country has ever seen ...
p306
aVwith this face.
p307
aVYeah.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VWhich has alternately been described as ugly, unconventional,
p312
aVand strangely, not chocolatey enough.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VThe people of this ancient land
p317
aVembraced me in their limitless love,
p318
aVand I've learned from these people
p319
aVthat neither power nor poverty
p320
aVcan make your life more magical
p321
aVor less tortuous.
p322
aVI've learned from the people of my country
p323
aVthat the dignity of a life,
p324
aVa human being, a culture, a religion, a country
p325
aVactually resides in its ability
p326
aVfor grace and compassion.
p327
aVI've learned that whatever moves you,
p328
aVwhatever urges you to create, to build,
p329
aVwhatever keeps you from failing,
p330
aVwhatever helps you survive,
p331
aVis perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known to mankind,
p332
aVand that is love.
p333
aVA mystic poet from my land famously wrote,
p334
aa(lp335
V(Recites poem in Hindi)
p336
aa(lp337
V(Poem ends)
p338
aa(lp339
VWhich loosely translates into that whatever \u2014
p340
aVyeah, if you know Hindi, please clap, yeah.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VIt's very difficult to remember.
p345
aVWhich loosely translates into actually saying
p346
aVthat all the books of knowledge that you might read
p347
aVand then go ahead and impart your knowledge
p348
aVthrough innovation, through creativity, through technology,
p349
aVbut mankind will never be the wiser about its future
p350
aVunless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings.
p351
aVThe two and a half alphabets which form the word "\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e,"
p352
aVwhich means "love,"
p353
aVif you are able to understand that
p354
aVand practice it,
p355
aVthat itself is enough to enlighten mankind.
p356
aVSo I truly believe the future "you"
p357
aVhas to be a you that loves.
p358
aVOtherwise it will cease to flourish.
p359
aVIt will perish in its own self-absorption.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo you may use your power
p362
aVto build walls
p363
aVand keep people outside,
p364
aVor you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in.
p365
aVYou may use your faith
p366
aVto make people afraid
p367
aVand terrify them into submission,
p368
aVor you can use it to give courage to people
p369
aVso they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment.
p370
aVYou can use your energy
p371
aVto build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness of destruction,
p372
aVor you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions.
p373
aVYou may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests.
p374
aVYou can destroy the ecology,
p375
aVor turn to them with love
p376
aVand regenerate life from the waters and trees.
p377
aVYou may land on Mars
p378
aVand build armed citadels,
p379
aVor you may look for life-forms and species to learn from and respect.
p380
aVAnd you can use all the moneys we all have earned
p381
aVto wage futile wars
p382
aVand give guns in the hands of little children
p383
aVto kill each other with,
p384
aVor you can use it
p385
aVto make more food
p386
aVto fill their stomachs with.
p387
aa(lp388
VMy country has taught me
p389
aVthe capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness.
p390
aVIt shines forth in a world
p391
aVwhich civilization, I think, already has tampered too much with.
p392
aVIn the last few days, the talks here, the wonderful people
p393
aVcoming and showing their talent,
p394
aVtalking about individual achievements, the innovation, the technology,
p395
aVthe sciences, the knowledge we are gaining by being here
p396
aVin the presence of TED Talks and all of you
p397
aVare reasons enough for us to celebrate the future "us."
p398
aVBut within that celebration
p399
aVthe quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion
p400
aVhas to assert itself, has to assert itself,
p401
aVjust as equally.
p402
aa(lp403
VSo I believe the future "you"
p404
aVis an infinite you.
p405
aVIt's called a chakra in India, like a circle.
p406
aVIt ends where it begins from to complete itself.
p407
aVA you that perceives time and space differently
p408
aVunderstands both
p409
aVyour unimaginable
p410
aVand fantastic importance
p411
aVand your complete unimportance in the larger context of the universe.
p412
aVA you that returns back
p413
aVto the original innocence of humanity,
p414
aVwhich loves from the purity of heart,
p415
aVwhich sees from the eyes of truth,
p416
aVwhich dreams from the clarity of an untampered mind.
p417
aa(lp418
VThe future "you" has to be
p419
aVlike an aging movie star
p420
aVwho has been made to believe that there is a possibility
p421
aVof a world which is completely,
p422
aVwholly, self-obsessively
p423
aVin love with itself.
p424
aVA world \u2014 really, it has to be a you
p425
aVto create a world
p426
aVwhich is its own best lover.
p427
aVThat I believe, ladies and gentlemen,
p428
aVshould be the future "you."
p429
aa(lp430
VThank you very much.
p431
aVShukriya.
