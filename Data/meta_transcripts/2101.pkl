VIt's very nice to be here tonight.
p4
aa(lp5
VSo I've been working on the history of income
p6
aVand wealth distribution for the past 15 years,
p7
aVand one of the interesting lessons
p8
aVcoming from this historical evidence
p9
aVis indeed that, in the long run,
p10
aVthere is a tendency for  the rate of return of capital
p11
aVto exceed the economy's growth rate,
p12
aVand this tends to lead to  high concentration of wealth.
p13
aVNot infinite concentration of wealth,
p14
aVbut the higher the gap between r and g,
p15
aVthe higher the level of inequality of wealth
p16
aVtowards which society tends to converge.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today,
p19
aVbut let me say right away
p20
aVthat this is not the only important force
p21
aVin the dynamics of income  and wealth distribution,
p22
aVand there are many other forces that play
p23
aVan important role in the long-run dynamics
p24
aVof income and wealth distribution.
p25
aVAlso there is a lot of data
p26
aVthat still needs to be collected.
p27
aVWe know a little bit more today
p28
aVthan we used to know,  but we still know too little,
p29
aVand certainly there are  many different processes \u2014
p30
aVeconomic, social, political \u2014
p31
aVthat need to be studied more.
p32
aVAnd so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,
p33
aVbut that doesn't mean that other important forces
p34
aVdo not exist.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo most of the data I'm going to present
p37
aVcomes from this database
p38
aVthat's available online:
p39
aVthe World Top Incomes Database.
p40
aVSo this is the largest existing
p41
aVhistorical database on inequality,
p42
aVand this comes from the effort
p43
aVof over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.
p44
aVSo let me show you a couple of facts
p45
aVcoming from this database,
p46
aVand then we'll return to r bigger than g.
p47
aVSo fact number one is that there has been
p48
aVa big reversal in the ordering of income inequality
p49
aVbetween the United States and Europe
p50
aVover the past century.
p51
aVSo back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually
p52
aVmuch higher in Europe than in the United States,
p53
aVwhereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.
p54
aVSo let me be very clear:
p55
aVThe main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.
p56
aVIt has more to do with changing supply and demand
p57
aVfor skill, the race between education and technology,
p58
aVglobalization, probably more unequal access
p59
aVto skills in the U.S.,
p60
aVwhere you have very good, very top universities
p61
aVbut where the bottom part of the educational system
p62
aVis not as good,
p63
aVso very unequal access to skills,
p64
aVand also an unprecedented rise
p65
aVof top managerial compensation of the United States,
p66
aVwhich is difficult to account for just on the basis of education.
p67
aVSo there is more going on here,
p68
aVbut I'm not going to talk too much about this today,
p69
aVbecause I want to focus on wealth inequality.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo let me just show you a very simple indicator
p72
aVabout the income inequality part.
p73
aVSo this is the share of total income
p74
aVgoing to the top 10 percent.
p75
aVSo you can see that one century ago,
p76
aVit was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe
p77
aVand a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,
p78
aVso there was more inequality in Europe.
p79
aVThen there was a sharp decline
p80
aVduring the first half of the 20th century,
p81
aVand in the recent decade, you can see that
p82
aVthe U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,
p83
aVand this is the first fact I just talked about.
p84
aVNow, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,
p85
aVand here the central fact is that wealth inequality
p86
aVis always a lot higher than income inequality,
p87
aVand also that wealth inequality,
p88
aValthough it has also increased in recent decades,
p89
aVis still less extreme today
p90
aVthan what it was a century ago,
p91
aValthough the total quantity of wealth
p92
aVrelative to income has now recovered
p93
aVfrom the very large shocks
p94
aVcaused by World War I, the Great Depression,
p95
aVWorld War II.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo let me show you two graphs
p98
aVillustrating fact number two and fact number three.
p99
aVSo first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,
p100
aVthis is the share of total wealth
p101
aVgoing to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,
p102
aVso you can see the same kind of reversal
p103
aVbetween the U.S. and Europe that we had before
p104
aVfor income inequality.
p105
aVSo wealth concentration was higher
p106
aVin Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,
p107
aVand now it is the opposite.
p108
aVBut you can also show two things:
p109
aVFirst, the general level of wealth inequality
p110
aVis always higher than income inequality.
p111
aVSo remember, for income inequality,
p112
aVthe share going to the top 10 percent
p113
aVwas between 30 and 50 percent of total income,
p114
aVwhereas for wealth, the share is always
p115
aVbetween 60 and 90 percent.
p116
aVOkay, so that's fact number one,
p117
aVand that's very important for what follows.
p118
aVWealth concentration is always
p119
aVa lot higher than income concentration.
p120
aa(lp121
VFact number two is that the rise
p122
aVin wealth inequality in recent decades
p123
aVis still not enough to get us back to 1910.
p124
aVSo the big difference today,
p125
aVwealth inequality is still very large,
p126
aVwith 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,
p127
aVbut the good news is that it's actually
p128
aVbetter than one century ago,
p129
aVwhere you had 90 percent in Europe going to the top 10.
p130
aVSo today what you have
p131
aVis what I call the middle 40 percent,
p132
aVthe people who are not in the top 10
p133
aVand who are not in the bottom 50,
p134
aVand what you can view as the wealth middle class
p135
aVthat owns 20 to 30 percent
p136
aVof total wealth, national wealth,
p137
aVwhereas they used to be poor, a century ago,
p138
aVwhen there was basically no wealth middle class.
p139
aVSo this is an important change,
p140
aVand it's interesting to see that wealth inequality
p141
aVhas not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,
p142
aValthough the total quantity of wealth has recovered.
p143
aVOkay? So this is the total value
p144
aVof wealth relative to income,
p145
aVand you can see that in particular in Europe,
p146
aVwe are almost back to the pre-World War I level.
p147
aVSo there are really two
p148
aVdifferent parts of the story here.
p149
aVOne has to do with
p150
aVthe total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,
p151
aVand there is nothing bad per se, of course,
p152
aVin accumulating a lot of wealth,
p153
aVand in particular if it is more diffuse
p154
aVand less concentrated.
p155
aVSo what we really want to focus on
p156
aVis the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,
p157
aVand what's going to happen in the future.
p158
aVHow can we account for the fact that
p159
aVuntil World War I, wealth inequality was so high
p160
aVand, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,
p161
aVand how can we think about the future?
p162
aa(lp163
VSo let me come to some of the explanations
p164
aVand speculations about the future.
p165
aVLet me first say that
p166
aVprobably the best model to explain
p167
aVwhy wealth is so much
p168
aVmore concentrated than income
p169
aVis a dynamic, dynastic model
p170
aVwhere individuals have a long horizon
p171
aVand accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.
p172
aVIf people were accumulating wealth
p173
aVonly for life cycle reasons,
p174
aVyou know, to be able to consume
p175
aVwhen they are old,
p176
aVthen the level of wealth inequality
p177
aVshould be more or less in line
p178
aVwith the level of income inequality.
p179
aVBut it will be very difficult to explain
p180
aVwhy you have so much more wealth inequality
p181
aVthan income inequality
p182
aVwith a pure life cycle model,
p183
aVso you need a story
p184
aVwhere people also care
p185
aVabout wealth accumulation for other reasons.
p186
aVSo typically, they want to transmit
p187
aVwealth to the next generation, to their children,
p188
aVor sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
p189
aVbecause of the prestige, the power that goes with wealth.
p190
aVSo there must be other reasons
p191
aVfor accumulating wealth than just life cycle
p192
aVto explain what we see in the data.
p193
aVNow, in a large class of dynamic models
p194
aVof wealth accumulation
p195
aVwith such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,
p196
aVyou will have all sorts of random,
p197
aVmultiplicative shocks.
p198
aVSo for instance, some families
p199
aVhave a very large number of children,
p200
aVso the wealth will be divided.
p201
aVSome families have fewer children.
p202
aVYou also have shocks to rates of return.
p203
aVSome families make huge capital gains.
p204
aVSome made bad investments.
p205
aVSo you will always have some mobility
p206
aVin the wealth process.
p207
aVSome people will move up, some people will move down.
p208
aVThe important point is that,
p209
aVin any such model,
p210
aVfor a given variance of such shocks,
p211
aVthe equilibrium level of wealth inequality
p212
aVwill be a steeply rising function of r minus g.
p213
aVAnd intuitively, the reason why the difference
p214
aVbetween the rate of return to wealth
p215
aVand the growth rate is important
p216
aVis that initial wealth inequalities
p217
aVwill be amplified at a faster pace
p218
aVwith a bigger r minus g.
p219
aVSo take a simple example,
p220
aVwith r equals five percent and g equals one percent,
p221
aVwealth holders only need to reinvest
p222
aVone fifth of their capital income to ensure
p223
aVthat their wealth rises as fast
p224
aVas the size of the economy.
p225
aVSo this makes it easier
p226
aVto build and perpetuate large fortunes
p227
aVbecause you can consume four fifths,
p228
aVassuming zero tax,
p229
aVand you can just reinvest one fifth.
p230
aVSo of course some families will consume more than that,
p231
aVsome will consume less, so there will be
p232
aVsome mobility in the distribution,
p233
aVbut on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,
p234
aVso this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow, you should not be surprised
p237
aVby the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,
p238
aVbecause, in fact, this is what happened
p239
aVduring most of the history of mankind.
p240
aVAnd this was in a way very obvious to everybody
p241
aVfor a simple reason, which is that growth
p242
aVwas close to zero percent
p243
aVduring most of the history of mankind.
p244
aVGrowth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,
p245
aVbut very slow growth of population
p246
aVand output per capita,
p247
aVwhereas the rate of return on capital
p248
aVof course was not zero percent.
p249
aVIt was, for land assets, which was
p250
aVthe traditional form
p251
aVof assets in preindustrial societies,
p252
aVit was typically five percent.
p253
aVAny reader of Jane Austen would know that.
p254
aVIf you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,
p255
aVyou should have a capital value
p256
aVof 20,000 pounds so that
p257
aVfive percent of 20,000 is 1,000.
p258
aVAnd in a way, this was
p259
aVthe very foundation of society,
p260
aVbecause r bigger than g
p261
aVwas what allowed holders of wealth and assets
p262
aVto live off their capital income
p263
aVand to do something else in life
p264
aVthan just to care about their own survival.
p265
aa(lp266
VNow, one important conclusion
p267
aVof my historical research is that
p268
aVmodern industrial growth did not change
p269
aVthis basic fact as much as one might have expected.
p270
aVOf course, the growth rate
p271
aVfollowing the Industrial Revolution
p272
aVrose, typically from zero to one to two percent,
p273
aVbut at the same time, the rate of return
p274
aVto capital also rose
p275
aVso that the gap between the two
p276
aVdid not really change.
p277
aVSo during the 20th century,
p278
aVyou had a very unique combination of events.
p279
aVFirst, a very low rate of return
p280
aVdue to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,
p281
aVdestruction of wealth, inflation,
p282
aVbankruptcy during the Great Depression,
p283
aVand all of this reduced
p284
aVthe private rate of return to wealth
p285
aVto unusually low levels
p286
aVbetween 1914 and 1945.
p287
aVAnd then, in the postwar period,
p288
aVyou had unusually high growth rate,
p289
aVpartly due to the reconstruction.
p290
aVYou know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,
p291
aVyou had five percent growth rate
p292
aVbetween 1950 and 1980
p293
aVlargely due to reconstruction,
p294
aVand also due to very large demographic growth,
p295
aVthe Baby Boom Cohort effect.
p296
aVNow, apparently that's not going to last for very long,
p297
aVor at least the population growth
p298
aVis supposed to decline in the future,
p299
aVand the best projections we have is that
p300
aVthe long-run growth is going to be closer
p301
aVto one to two percent
p302
aVrather than four to five percent.
p303
aVSo if you look at this,
p304
aVthese are the best estimates we have
p305
aVof world GDP growth
p306
aVand rate of return on capital,
p307
aVaverage rates of return on capital,
p308
aVso you can see that during most
p309
aVof the history of mankind,
p310
aVthe growth rate was very small,
p311
aVmuch lower than the rate of return,
p312
aVand then during the 20th century,
p313
aVit is really the population growth,
p314
aVvery high in the postwar period,
p315
aVand the reconstruction process
p316
aVthat brought growth
p317
aVto a smaller gap with the rate of return.
p318
aVHere I use the United Nations population projections,
p319
aVso of course they are uncertain.
p320
aVIt could be that we all start
p321
aVhaving a lot of children in the future,
p322
aVand the growth rates are going to be higher,
p323
aVbut from now on,
p324
aVthese are the best projections we have,
p325
aVand this will make global growth
p326
aVdecline and the gap between
p327
aVthe rate of return go up.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow, the other unusual event
p330
aVduring the 20th century
p331
aVwas, as I said,
p332
aVdestruction, taxation of capital,
p333
aVso this is the pre-tax rate of return.
p334
aVThis is the after-tax rate of return,
p335
aVand after destruction,
p336
aVand this is what brought
p337
aVthe average rate of return
p338
aVafter tax, after destruction,
p339
aVbelow the growth rate during a long time period.
p340
aVBut without the destruction,
p341
aVwithout the taxation, this  would not have happened.
p342
aVSo let me say that the balance between
p343
aVreturns on capital and growth
p344
aVdepends on many different factors
p345
aVthat are very difficult to predict:
p346
aVtechnology and the development
p347
aVof capital-intensive techniques.
p348
aVSo right now, the most capital-intensive sectors
p349
aVin the economy are the real estate sector, housing,
p350
aVthe energy sector, but it could be in the future
p351
aVthat we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors
p352
aVand that this would be a bigger share
p353
aVof the total capital stock that it is today.
p354
aVWell, we are very far from this,
p355
aVand from now, what's going on
p356
aVin the real estate sector, the energy sector,
p357
aVis much more important for the total capital stock
p358
aVand capital share.
p359
aa(lp360
VThe other important issue
p361
aVis that there are scale effects in portfolio management,
p362
aVtogether with financial complexity,
p363
aVfinancial deregulation,
p364
aVthat make it easier to get higher rates of return
p365
aVfor a large portfolio,
p366
aVand this seems to be particularly strong
p367
aVfor billionaires, large capital endowments.
p368
aVJust to give you one example,
p369
aVthis comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings
p370
aVover the 1987-2013 period,
p371
aVand you can see the very top wealth holders
p372
aVhave been going up at six, seven percent per year
p373
aVin real terms above inflation,
p374
aVwhereas average income in the world,
p375
aVaverage wealth in the world,
p376
aVhave increased at only two percent per year.
p377
aVAnd you find the same
p378
aVfor large university endowments \u2014
p379
aVthe bigger the initial endowments,
p380
aVthe bigger the rate of return.
p381
aa(lp382
VNow, what could be done?
p383
aVThe first thing is that I think we need
p384
aVmore financial transparency.
p385
aVWe know too little about global wealth dynamics,
p386
aVso we need international transmission
p387
aVof bank information.
p388
aVWe need a global registry of financial assets,
p389
aVmore coordination on wealth taxation,
p390
aVand even wealth tax with a small tax rate
p391
aVwill be a way to produce information
p392
aVso that then we can adapt our policies
p393
aVto whatever we observe.
p394
aVAnd to some extent, the fight
p395
aVagainst tax havens
p396
aVand automatic transmission of information
p397
aVis pushing us in this direction.
p398
aVNow, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,
p399
aVwhich it can be tempting to use.
p400
aVInflation:
p401
aVit's much easier to print money
p402
aVthan to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,
p403
aVbut sometimes you don't know what you do with the money.
p404
aVThis is a problem.
p405
aVExpropriation is very tempting.
p406
aVJust when you feel some people get too wealthy,
p407
aVyou just expropriate them.
p408
aVBut this is not a very efficient way
p409
aVto organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.
p410
aVSo war is an even less efficient way,
p411
aVso I tend to prefer progressive taxation,
p412
aVbut of course, history \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p413
aVhistory will invent its own best ways,
p414
aVand it will probably involve
p415
aVa combination of all of these.
p416
aa(lp417
VThank you.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Applause)
p420
aa(lp421
VBruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.
p422
aa(lp423
VThomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,
p424
aVbecause it's impressive how you're in command of your data, of course,
p425
aVbut basically what you suggest is
p426
aVgrowing wealth concentration is kind of
p427
aVa natural tendency of capitalism,
p428
aVand if we leave it to its own devices,
p429
aVit may threaten the system itself,
p430
aVso you're suggesting that we need to act
p431
aVto implement policies that redistribute wealth,
p432
aVincluding the ones we just saw:
p433
aVprogressive taxation, etc.
p434
aVIn the current political context,
p435
aVhow realistic are those?
p436
aVHow likely do you think that it is
p437
aVthat they will be implemented?
p438
aa(lp439
VThomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think
p440
aVif you look back through time,
p441
aVthe history of income, wealth and taxation
p442
aVis full of surprise.
p443
aVSo I am not terribly impressed
p444
aVby those who know in advance
p445
aVwhat will or will not happen.
p446
aVI think one century ago,
p447
aVmany people would have said
p448
aVthat progressive income taxation would never happen
p449
aVand then it happened.
p450
aVAnd even five years ago,
p451
aVmany people would have said that bank secrecy
p452
aVwill be with us forever in Switzerland,
p453
aVthat Switzerland was too powerful
p454
aVfor the rest of the world,
p455
aVand then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions
p456
aVagainst Swiss banks for a big change to happen,
p457
aVand now we are moving toward
p458
aVmore financial transparency.
p459
aVSo I think it's not that difficult
p460
aVto better coordinate politically.
p461
aVWe are going to have a treaty
p462
aVwith half of the world GDP around the table
p463
aVwith the U.S. and the European Union,
p464
aVso if half of the world GDP is not enough
p465
aVto make progress on financial transparency
p466
aVand minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,
p467
aVwhat does it take?
p468
aVSo I think these are not technical difficulties.
p469
aVI think we can make progress
p470
aVif we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions
p471
aVand we have the proper sanctions
p472
aVon those who benefit from financial opacity.
p473
aa(lp474
VBG: One of the arguments
p475
aVagainst your point of view
p476
aVis that economic inequality
p477
aVis not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines.
p478
aVSo we take measures to lower inequality,
p479
aVand at the same time we lower growth, potentially.
p480
aVWhat do you answer to that?
p481
aa(lp482
VTP: Yeah, I think inequality
p483
aVis not a problem per se.
p484
aVI think inequality up to a point
p485
aVcan actually be useful for innovation and growth.
p486
aVThe problem is, it's a question of degree.
p487
aVWhen inequality gets too extreme,
p488
aVthen it becomes useless for growth
p489
aVand it can even become bad
p490
aVbecause it tends to lead to high perpetuation
p491
aVof inequality over time
p492
aVand low mobility.
p493
aVAnd for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations
p494
aVthat we had in the 19th century
p495
aVand pretty much until World War I
p496
aVin every European country
p497
aVwas, I think, not useful for growth.
p498
aVThis was destroyed by a combination
p499
aVof tragic events and policy changes,
p500
aVand this did not prevent growth from happening.
p501
aVAnd also, extreme inequality can be bad
p502
aVfor our democratic institutions
p503
aVif it creates very unequal access to political voice,
p504
aVand the influence of private money
p505
aVin U.S. politics, I think,
p506
aVis a matter of concern right now.
p507
aVSo we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,
p508
aVpre-World War I inequality.
p509
aVHaving a decent share of the national wealth
p510
aVfor the middle class is not bad for growth.
p511
aVIt is actually useful
p512
aVboth for equity and efficiency reasons.
p513
aa(lp514
VBG: I said at the beginning
p515
aVthat your book has been criticized.
p516
aVSome of your data has been criticized.
p517
aVSome of your choice of data sets has been criticized.
p518
aVYou have been accused of cherry-picking data
p519
aVto make your case. What do you answer to that?
p520
aa(lp521
VTP: Well, I answer that I am very happy
p522
aVthat this book is stimulating debate.
p523
aVThis is part of what it is intended for.
p524
aVLook, the reason why I put all the data online
p525
aVwith all of the detailed computation
p526
aVis so that we can have  an open and transparent
p527
aVdebate about this.
p528
aVSo I have responded point by point
p529
aVto every concern.
p530
aVLet me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,
p531
aVI would actually conclude
p532
aVthat the rise in wealth inequality,
p533
aVparticularly in the United States,
p534
aVhas been actually higher than what I report in my book.
p535
aVThere is a recent study by Saez and Zucman
p536
aVshowing, with new data
p537
aVwhich I didn't have at the time of the book,
p538
aVthat wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen
p539
aVeven more than what I report.
p540
aVAnd there will be other data in the future.
p541
aVSome of it will go in different directions.
p542
aVLook, we put online almost every week
p543
aVnew, updated series on the World Top Income Database
p544
aVand we will keep doing so in the future,
p545
aVin particular in emerging countries,
p546
aVand I welcome all of those who want to contribute
p547
aVto this data collection process.
p548
aVIn fact, I certainly agree
p549
aVthat there is not enough
p550
aVtransparency about wealth dynamics,
p551
aVand a good way to have better data
p552
aVwould be to have a wealth tax
p553
aVwith a small tax rate to begin with
p554
aVso that we can all agree
p555
aVabout this important evolution
p556
aVand adapt our policies to whatever we observe.
p557
aVSo taxation is a source of knowledge,
p558
aVand that's what we need the most right now.
