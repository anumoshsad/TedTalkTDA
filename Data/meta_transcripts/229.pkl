VI grew up to study the brain
p4
aVbecause I have a brother who has been diagnosed
p5
aVwith a brain disorder, schizophrenia.
p6
aVAnd as a sister and later, as a scientist,
p7
aVI wanted to understand, why is it that I can take my dreams,
p8
aVI can connect them to my reality,
p9
aVand I can make my dreams come true?
p10
aVWhat is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia
p11
aVthat he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality,
p12
aVso they instead become delusion?
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses.
p15
aVAnd I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston,
p16
aVwhere I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes,
p17
aVin the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.
p18
aVAnd in the lab, we were asking the question,
p19
aV"What are the biological differences
p20
aVbetween the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control,
p21
aVas compared with the brains of individuals
p22
aVdiagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"
p23
aa(lp24
VSo we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:
p25
aVwhich cells are communicating with which cells,
p26
aVwith which chemicals,
p27
aVand then in what quantities of those chemicals?
p28
aVSo there was a lot of meaning in my life
p29
aVbecause I was performing this type of research during the day,
p30
aVbut then in the evenings and on the weekends,
p31
aVI traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut on the morning of December 10, 1996,
p34
aVI woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.
p35
aVA blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.
p36
aVAnd in the course of four hours,
p37
aVI watched my brain completely deteriorate
p38
aVin its ability to process all information.
p39
aVOn the morning of the hemorrhage,
p40
aVI could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.
p41
aVI essentially became an infant in a woman's body.
p42
aa(lp43
VIf you've ever seen a human brain,
p44
aVit's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.
p45
aVAnd I have brought for you a real human brain.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Groaning, laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo this is a real human brain.
p50
aVThis is the front of the brain,
p51
aVthe back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down,
p52
aVand this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.
p53
aVAnd when you look at the brain,
p54
aVit's obvious that the two cerebral cortices
p55
aVare completely separate from one another.
p56
aa(lp57
VFor those of you who understand computers,
p58
aVour right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor,
p59
aVwhile our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.
p60
aVThe two hemispheres do communicate with one another
p61
aVthrough the corpus callosum,
p62
aVwhich is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.
p63
aVBut other than that,
p64
aVthe two hemispheres are completely separate.
p65
aVBecause they process information differently,
p66
aVeach of our hemispheres think about different things,
p67
aVthey care about different things, and, dare I say,
p68
aVthey have very different personalities.
p69
aVExcuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
p70
aa(lp71
VAssistant: It has been.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VOur right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.
p76
aVIt's all about "right here, right now."
p77
aVOur right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures
p78
aVand it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
p79
aVInformation, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously
p80
aVthrough all of our sensory systems
p81
aVand then it explodes into this enormous collage
p82
aVof what this present moment looks like,
p83
aVwhat this present moment smells like and tastes like,
p84
aVwhat it feels like and what it sounds like.
p85
aVI am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me
p86
aVthrough the consciousness of my right hemisphere.
p87
aVWe are energy-beings connected to one another
p88
aVthrough the consciousness of our right hemispheres
p89
aVas one human family.
p90
aVAnd right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet,
p91
aVhere to make the world a better place.
p92
aVAnd in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.
p93
aa(lp94
VMy left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place.
p95
aVOur left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.
p96
aVOur left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future.
p97
aVOur left hemisphere is designed to take
p98
aVthat enormous collage of the present moment
p99
aVand start picking out details, and more details about those details.
p100
aVIt then categorizes and organizes all that information,
p101
aVassociates it with everything in the past we've ever learned,
p102
aVand projects into the future all of our possibilities.
p103
aVAnd our left hemisphere thinks in language.
p104
aVIt's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world
p105
aVto my external world.
p106
aVIt's that little voice that says to me,
p107
aV"Hey, you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home.
p108
aVI need them in the morning."
p109
aVIt's that calculating intelligence
p110
aVthat reminds me when I have to do my laundry.
p111
aVBut perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me,
p112
aV"I am. I am."
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am,"
p115
aVI become separate.
p116
aVI become a single solid individual,
p117
aVseparate from the energy flow around me
p118
aVand separate from you.
p119
aVAnd this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
p120
aa(lp121
VOn the morning of the stroke,
p122
aVI woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.
p123
aVAnd it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream.
p124
aVAnd it just gripped me \u2014
p125
aVand then it released me.
p126
aVAnd then it just gripped me \u2014
p127
aVand then it released me.
p128
aVAnd it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain,
p129
aVso I thought, "OK, I'll just start my normal routine."
p130
aa(lp131
VSo I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider,
p132
aVwhich is a full-body, full-exercise machine.
p133
aVAnd I'm jamming away on this thing,
p134
aVand I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws
p135
aVgrasping onto the bar.
p136
aVAnd I thought, "That's very peculiar."
p137
aVAnd I looked down at my body
p138
aVand I thought, "Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."
p139
aVAnd it was as though my consciousness had shifted away
p140
aVfrom my normal perception of reality,
p141
aVwhere I'm the person on the machine having the experience,
p142
aVto some esoteric space
p143
aVwhere I'm witnessing myself having this experience.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse.
p146
aVSo I get off the machine,
p147
aVand I'm walking across my living room floor,
p148
aVand I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.
p149
aVAnd every step is very rigid and very deliberate.
p150
aVThere's no fluidity to my pace,
p151
aVand there's this constriction in my area of perception,
p152
aVso I'm just focused on internal systems.
p153
aVAnd I'm standing in my bathroom
p154
aVgetting ready to step into the shower,
p155
aVand I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body.
p156
aVI heard a little voice saying, "OK. You muscles, you've got to contract.
p157
aVYou muscles, you relax."
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.
p160
aVAnd I look down at my arm
p161
aVand I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.
p162
aVI can't define where I begin and where I end,
p163
aVbecause the atoms and the molecules of my arm
p164
aVblended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.
p165
aVAnd all I could detect was this energy \u2014 energy.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd I'm asking myself, "What is wrong with me?
p168
aVWhat is going on?"
p169
aVAnd in that moment, my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent.
p170
aVJust like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button.
p171
aVTotal silence.
p172
aVAnd at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind.
p173
aVBut then I was immediately captivated
p174
aVby the magnificence of the energy around me.
p175
aVAnd because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body,
p176
aVI felt enormous and expansive.
p177
aVI felt at one with all the energy that was,
p178
aVand it was beautiful there.
p179
aa(lp180
VThen all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online
p181
aVand it says to me, "Hey! We've got a problem!
p182
aVWe've got to get some help."
p183
aVAnd I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."
p188
aVBut then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness \u2014
p189
aVand I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land.
p190
aVBut it was beautiful there.
p191
aVImagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected
p192
aVfrom your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo here I am in this space,
p195
aVand my job, and any stress related to my job \u2014 it was gone.
p196
aVAnd I felt lighter in my body.
p197
aVAnd imagine all of the relationships in the external world
p198
aVand any stressors related to any of those \u2014 they were gone.
p199
aVAnd I felt this sense of peacefulness.
p200
aVAnd imagine what it would feel like to lose
p201
aV37 years of emotional baggage!
p202
aV(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria \u2014
p203
aVeuphoria.
p204
aVIt was beautiful.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says,
p207
aV"Hey! You've got to pay attention.
p208
aVWe've got to get help."
p209
aVAnd I'm thinking, "I've got to get help. I've got to focus."
p210
aVSo I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress
p211
aVand I'm walking around my apartment,
p212
aVand I'm thinking, "I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd in that moment,
p215
aVmy right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.
p216
aVThen I realized, "Oh my gosh! I'm having a stroke!"
p217
aVAnd the next thing my brain says to me is,
p218
aVWow! This is so cool!
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VThis is so cool!
p223
aVHow many brain scientists have the opportunity
p224
aVto study their own brain from the inside out?"
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then it crosses my mind, "But I'm a very busy woman!"
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
V"I don't have time for a stroke!"
p233
aVSo I'm like, "OK, I can't stop the stroke from happening,
p234
aVso I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.
p235
aVSo I've got to call help. I've got to call work."
p236
aVI couldn't remember the number at work,
p237
aVso I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number.
p238
aVSo I go into my business room, I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.
p239
aVAnd I'm looking at the card on top
p240
aVand even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye
p241
aVwhat my business card looked like,
p242
aVI couldn't tell if this was my card or not,
p243
aVbecause all I could see were pixels.
p244
aVAnd the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background
p245
aVand the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell.
p246
aVAnd then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.
p247
aVAnd in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality
p248
aVand I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card.
p249
aVIt took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.
p250
aVIn the meantime, for 45 minutes,
p251
aVthe hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
p252
aVI do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone,
p253
aVbut it's the only plan I have.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo I take the phone pad and I put it right here.
p256
aVI take the business card, I put it right here,
p257
aVand I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card
p258
aVto the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.
p259
aVBut then I would drift back out into La La Land,
p260
aVand not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers.
p261
aVSo I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump
p262
aVand cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them,
p263
aVso that as I would come back to normal reality,
p264
aVI'd be able to tell, "Yes, I've already dialed that number."
p265
aa(lp266
VEventually, the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone,
p267
aVand my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,
p268
aV"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd I think to myself,
p273
aV"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!"
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd so I say to him \u2014 clear in my mind, I say to him:
p278
aV"This is Jill! I need help!"
p279
aVAnd what comes out of my voice is, "Woo woo woo woo woo."
p280
aVI'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever."
p281
aVSo I couldn't know \u2014 I didn't know
p282
aVthat I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.
p283
aVSo he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd a little while later, I am riding in an ambulance
p286
aVfrom one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.
p287
aVAnd I curl up into a little fetal ball.
p288
aVAnd just like a balloon with the last bit of air,
p289
aVjust right out of the balloon,
p290
aVI just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life.
p293
aVAnd either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life,
p294
aVor this was perhaps my moment of transition.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhen I woke later that afternoon,
p297
aVI was shocked to discover that I was still alive.
p298
aVWhen I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life.
p299
aVAnd my mind was now suspended
p300
aVbetween two very opposite planes of reality.
p301
aVStimulation coming in through my sensory systems
p302
aVfelt like pure pain.
p303
aVLight burned my brain like wildfire,
p304
aVand sounds were so loud and chaotic
p305
aVthat I could not pick a voice out from the background noise,
p306
aVand I just wanted to escape.
p307
aVBecause I could not identify the position of my body in space,
p308
aVI felt enormous and expansive,
p309
aVlike a genie just liberated from her bottle.
p310
aVAnd my spirit soared free,
p311
aVlike a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.
p312
aVNirvana.
p313
aVI found Nirvana.
p314
aVAnd I remember thinking,
p315
aVthere's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself
p316
aVback inside this tiny little body.
p317
aa(lp318
VBut then I realized, "But I'm still alive!
p319
aVI'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.
p320
aVAnd if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive,
p321
aVthen everyone who is alive can find Nirvana."
p322
aVAnd I pictured a world
p323
aVfilled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people
p324
aVwho knew that they could come to this space at any time.
p325
aVAnd that they could purposely choose
p326
aVto step to the right of their left hemispheres \u2014
p327
aVand find this peace.
p328
aVAnd then I realized
p329
aVwhat a tremendous gift this experience could be,
p330
aVwhat a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives.
p331
aVAnd it motivated me to recover.
p332
aa(lp333
VTwo and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in,
p334
aVand they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball
p335
aVthat was pushing on my language centers.
p336
aVHere I am with my mama,
p337
aVwho is a true angel in my life.
p338
aVIt took me eight years to completely recover.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo who are we?
p341
aVWe are the life-force power of the universe,
p342
aVwith manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.
p343
aVAnd we have the power to choose, moment by moment,
p344
aVwho and how we want to be in the world.
p345
aVRight here, right now,
p346
aVI can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are.
p347
aVI am the life-force power of the universe.
p348
aVI am the life-force power
p349
aVof the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form,
p350
aVat one with all that is.
p351
aVOr, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere,
p352
aVwhere I become a single individual, a solid.
p353
aVSeparate from the flow, separate from you.
p354
aVI am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:
p355
aVintellectual, neuroanatomist.
p356
aVThese are the "we" inside of me.
p357
aVWhich would you choose?
p358
aVWhich do you choose?
p359
aVAnd when?
p360
aVI believe that the more time we spend
p361
aVchoosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry
p362
aVof our right hemispheres,
p363
aVthe more peace we will project into the world,
p364
aVand the more peaceful our planet will be.
p365
aVAnd I thought that was an idea worth spreading.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.
