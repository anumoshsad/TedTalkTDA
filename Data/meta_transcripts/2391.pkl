VCan I get a show of hands \u2014
p4
aVhow many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year?
p5
aVThat's pretty good.
p6
aVWell, it turns out that you share that experience
p7
aVwith more than three billion people every year.
p8
aVAnd when we put so many people in all these metal tubes
p9
aVthat fly all over the world,
p10
aVsometimes, things like this can happen
p11
aVand you get a disease epidemic.
p12
aa(lp13
VI first actually got into this topic
p14
aVwhen I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year.
p15
aVAnd it turns out that,
p16
aValthough Ebola spreads through these more range-limited,
p17
aVlarge-droplet routes,
p18
aVthere's all these other sorts of diseases
p19
aVthat can be spread in the airplane cabin.
p20
aVThe worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers,
p21
aVit's pretty scary.
p22
aVSo with H1N1,
p23
aVthere was this guy that decided to go on the plane
p24
aVand in the matter of a single flight
p25
aVactually spread the disease to 17 other people.
p26
aVAnd then there was this other guy with SARS,
p27
aVwho managed to go on a three-hour flight
p28
aVand spread the disease to 22 other people.
p29
aVThat's not exactly my idea of a great superpower.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen we take a look at this, what we also find
p32
aVis that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases.
p33
aVSo when someone actually goes on a plane,
p34
aVthey could be sick
p35
aVand they could actually be in this latency period
p36
aVin which they could actually have the disease
p37
aVbut not exhibit any symptoms,
p38
aVand they could, in turn, spread the disease
p39
aVto many other people in the cabin.
p40
aa(lp41
VHow that actually works is that right now
p42
aVwe've got air coming in from the top of the cabin
p43
aVand from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue.
p44
aVAnd then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters
p45
aVthat eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets.
p46
aVWhat happens right now, though,
p47
aVis that we have this mixing airflow pattern.
p48
aVSo if someone were to actually sneeze,
p49
aVthat air would get swirled around multiple times
p50
aVbefore it even has a chance to go out through the filter.
p51
aVSo I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem.
p52
aa(lp53
VI didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane,
p54
aVso I decided to build a computer instead.
p55
aVIt actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics,
p56
aVwhat we're able to do is create these simulations
p57
aVthat give us higher resolutions
p58
aVthan actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane.
p59
aVAnd so how, essentially, this works is you would start out
p60
aVwith these 2D drawings \u2014
p61
aVthese are floating around in technical papers around the Internet.
p62
aVI take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software,
p63
aVreally building that 3D model.
p64
aVAnd then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces,
p65
aVessentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it.
p66
aVAnd then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin,
p67
aVthrow in a bunch of physics
p68
aVand basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this:
p71
aVyou'll notice the middle person sneezing,
p72
aVand we go "Splat!" \u2014 it goes right into people's faces.
p73
aVIt's pretty disgusting.
p74
aVFrom the front, you'll notice those two passengers
p75
aVsitting next to the central passenger
p76
aVnot exactly having a great time.
p77
aVAnd when we take a look at that from the side,
p78
aVyou'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe first thing I thought was, "This is no good."
p81
aVSo I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations
p82
aVand ultimately, I came up with this solution right here.
p83
aVThis is what I call a \u2014 patent pending \u2014 Global Inlet Director.
p84
aVWith this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission
p85
aVby about 55 times,
p86
aVand increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo how this actually works
p89
aVis we would install this piece of composite material
p90
aVinto these existing spots that are already in the plane.
p91
aVSo it's very cost-effective to install
p92
aVand we can do this directly overnight.
p93
aVAll we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go.
p94
aVAnd the results that we get are absolutely amazing.
p95
aVInstead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns,
p96
aVwe can create these walls of air
p97
aVthat come down in-between the passengers
p98
aVto create personalized breathing zones.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again,
p101
aVbut this time, we're able to effectively push that down
p102
aVto the filters for elimination.
p103
aVAnd same thing from the side,
p104
aVyou'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down.
p105
aVSo if you take a look again now at the same scenario
p106
aVbut with this innovation installed,
p107
aVyou'll notice the middle passenger sneezes,
p108
aVand this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet
p109
aVbefore it gets a chance to infect any other people.
p110
aVSo you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy
p111
aVare breathing virtually no pathogens at all.
p112
aVTake a look at that from the side as well,
p113
aVyou see a very efficient system.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd in short, with this system, we win.
p116
aVWhen we take a look at what this means,
p117
aVwhat we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes,
p118
aVbut also if the window-seat passenger sneezes
p119
aVor if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd so with this solution, what does this mean for the world?
p122
aVWell, when we take a look at this
p123
aVfrom the computer simulation into real life,
p124
aVwe can see with this 3D model that I built over here,
p125
aVessentially using 3D printing,
p126
aVwe can see those same airflow patterns coming down,
p127
aVright to the passengers.
p128
aVIn the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world
p129
aVabout 40 billion dollars.
p130
aVAnd in the future,
p131
aVa big disease outbreak could actually cost the world
p132
aVin excess of three trillion dollars.
p133
aVSo before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service
p134
aVfor one to two months,
p135
aVspend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars
p136
aVto try to change something.
p137
aVBut now, we're able to install something essentially overnight
p138
aVand see results right away.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification,
p141
aVflight testing,
p142
aVand going through all of these regulatory approvals processes.
p143
aVBut it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions
p144
aVare the simplest solutions.
p145
aVAnd two years ago, even,
p146
aVthis project would not have happened,
p147
aVjust because the technology then wouldn't have supported it.
p148
aVBut now with advanced computing
p149
aVand how developed our Internet is,
p150
aVit's really the golden era for innovation.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait?
p153
aVTogether, we can build the future today.
p154
aa(lp155
VThanks.
