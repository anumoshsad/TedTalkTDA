VI'm an ecologist,
p4
aVmostly a coral reef ecologist.
p5
aVI started out in Chesapeake Bay
p6
aVand went diving in the winter
p7
aVand became a tropical ecologist overnight.
p8
aVAnd it was really a lot of fun
p9
aVfor about 10 years.
p10
aVI mean, somebody pays you
p11
aVto go around and travel
p12
aVand look at some of the most
p13
aVbeautiful places on the planet.
p14
aVAnd that was what I did.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I ended up in Jamaica,
p17
aVin the West Indies,
p18
aVwhere the coral reefs were really
p19
aVamong the most extraordinary, structurally,
p20
aVthat I ever saw in my life.
p21
aVAnd this picture here,
p22
aVit's really interesting, it shows two things:
p23
aVFirst of all, it's in black and white
p24
aVbecause the water was so clear
p25
aVand you could see so far,
p26
aVand film was so slow
p27
aVin the 1960s and early 70s,
p28
aVyou took pictures in black and white.
p29
aVThe other thing it shows you
p30
aVis that, although there's this beautiful
p31
aVforest of coral,
p32
aVthere are no fish in that picture.
p33
aa(lp34
VThose reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica
p35
aVwere the most studied coral reefs
p36
aVin the world for 20 years.
p37
aVWe were the best and the brightest.
p38
aVPeople came to study our reefs from Australia,
p39
aVwhich is sort of funny
p40
aVbecause now we go to theirs.
p41
aVAnd the view of scientists
p42
aVabout how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,
p43
aVwas based on these reefs
p44
aVwithout any fish.
p45
aVThen, in 1980,
p46
aVthere was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.
p47
aVI put half the lab
p48
aVup in my house.
p49
aVThe wind blew very strong.
p50
aVThe waves were 25
p51
aVto 50 feet high.
p52
aVAnd the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,
p53
aVand we thought, "Well, we're real smart.
p54
aVWe know that hurricanes
p55
aVhave always happened in the past."
p56
aVAnd we published a paper in Science,
p57
aVthe first time that anybody ever
p58
aVdescribed the destruction
p59
aVon a coral reef by a major hurricane.
p60
aVAnd we predicted what would happen,
p61
aVand we got it all wrong.
p62
aVAnd the reason was
p63
aVbecause of overfishing,
p64
aVand the fact that a last common grazer,
p65
aVa sea urchin, died.
p66
aVAnd within a few months
p67
aVafter that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.
p68
aVAnd that is the same reef;
p69
aVthat's the same reef 15 years ago;
p70
aVthat's the same reef today.
p71
aVThe coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
p72
aVhave a few percent live coral cover
p73
aVand a lot of seaweed and slime.
p74
aVAnd that's more or less the story
p75
aVof the coral reefs of the Caribbean,
p76
aVand increasingly, tragically,
p77
aVthe coral reefs worldwide.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, that's my little, depressing story.
p80
aVAll of us in our 60s and 70s
p81
aVhave comparable depressing stories.
p82
aVThere are tens of thousands
p83
aVof those stories out there,
p84
aVand it's really hard to conjure up
p85
aVmuch of a sense of well-being,
p86
aVbecause it just keeps getting worse.
p87
aVAnd the reason it keeps getting worse
p88
aVis that after a natural catastrophe,
p89
aVlike a hurricane,
p90
aVit used to be that there was
p91
aVsome kind of successional sequence of recovery,
p92
aVbut what's going on now is that
p93
aVoverfishing and pollution and climate change
p94
aVare all interacting
p95
aVin a way that prevents that.
p96
aVAnd so I'm going to sort of go through
p97
aVand talk about those three
p98
aVkinds of things.
p99
aa(lp100
VWe hear a lot about
p101
aVthe collapse of cod.
p102
aVIt's difficult to imagine that
p103
aVtwo, or some historians would say three world wars
p104
aVwere fought during the colonial era
p105
aVfor the control of cod.
p106
aVCod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
p107
aVIt fed the slaves
p108
aVbrought to the Antilles,
p109
aVthe song "Jamaica Farewell" \u2014
p110
aV"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" \u2014
p111
aVis an emblem of the importance
p112
aVof salt cod from northeastern Canada.
p113
aVIt all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
p114
aV35,000 people lost their jobs.
p115
aVAnd that was the beginning
p116
aVof a kind of serial depletion
p117
aVfrom bigger and tastier species
p118
aVto smaller and not-so-tasty species,
p119
aVfrom species that were near to home
p120
aVto species that were all around the world,
p121
aVand what have you.
p122
aVIt's a little hard to understand that,
p123
aVbecause you can go to a Costco in the United States
p124
aVand buy cheap fish.
p125
aVYou ought to read the label to find out where it came from,
p126
aVbut it's still cheap,
p127
aVand everybody thinks it's okay.
p128
aa(lp129
VIt's hard to communicate this,
p130
aVand one way that I think is really interesting
p131
aVis to talk about sport fish,
p132
aVbecause people like to go out and catch fish.
p133
aVIt's one of those things.
p134
aVThis picture here shows the trophy fish,
p135
aVthe biggest fish caught
p136
aVby people who pay a lot of money
p137
aVto get on a boat,
p138
aVgo to a place off of Key West in Florida,
p139
aVdrink a lot of beer,
p140
aVthrow a lot of hooks and lines into the water,
p141
aVcome back with the biggest and the best fish,
p142
aVand the champion trophy fish
p143
aVare put on this board, where people take a picture,
p144
aVand this guy is obviously
p145
aVreally excited about that fish.
p146
aVWell, that's what it's like now,
p147
aVbut this is what it was like in the 1950s
p148
aVfrom the same boat in the same place
p149
aVon the same board on the same dock.
p150
aVThe trophy fish
p151
aVwere so big
p152
aVthat you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
p153
aVAnd the average size trophy fish
p154
aVweighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,
p155
aVand if you wanted to go out and kill something,
p156
aVyou could pretty much count on
p157
aVbeing able to catch one of those fish.
p158
aVAnd they tasted really good.
p159
aVAnd people paid less in 1950 dollars
p160
aVto catch that
p161
aVthan what people pay now
p162
aVto catch those little, tiny fish.
p163
aVAnd that's everywhere.
p164
aa(lp165
VIt's not just the fish, though,
p166
aVthat are disappearing.
p167
aVIndustrial fishing uses big stuff,
p168
aVbig machinery.
p169
aVWe use nets that are 20 miles long.
p170
aVWe use longlines
p171
aVthat have one million or two million hooks.
p172
aVAnd we trawl,
p173
aVwhich means to take something
p174
aVthe size of a tractor trailer truck
p175
aVthat weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,
p176
aVput it on a big chain,
p177
aVand drag it across the sea floor
p178
aVto stir up the bottom and catch the fish.
p179
aVThink of it as
p180
aVbeing kind of the bulldozing of a city
p181
aVor of a forest,
p182
aVbecause it clears it away.
p183
aVAnd the habitat destruction
p184
aVis unbelievable.
p185
aVThis is a photograph,
p186
aVa typical photograph,
p187
aVof what the continental shelves
p188
aVof the world look like.
p189
aVYou can see the rows in the bottom,
p190
aVthe way you can see the rows
p191
aVin a field that has just been plowed
p192
aVto plant corn.
p193
aVWhat that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,
p194
aVwhich is a critical habitat
p195
aVfor the development of fish.
p196
aVWhat it is now is mud,
p197
aVand the area of the ocean floor
p198
aVthat has been transformed from forest
p199
aVto level mud, to parking lot,
p200
aVis equivalent to the entire area
p201
aVof all the forests
p202
aVthat have ever been cut down
p203
aVon all of the earth
p204
aVin the history of humanity.
p205
aVWe've managed to do that
p206
aVin the last 100 to 150 years.
p207
aa(lp208
VWe tend to think of oil spills
p209
aVand mercury
p210
aVand we hear a lot about plastic these days.
p211
aVAnd all of that stuff is really disgusting,
p212
aVbut what's really insidious
p213
aVis the biological pollution that happens
p214
aVbecause of the magnitude of the shifts
p215
aVthat it causes
p216
aVto entire ecosystems.
p217
aVAnd I'm going to just talk very briefly
p218
aVabout two kinds of biological pollution:
p219
aVone is introduced species
p220
aVand the other is what comes from nutrients.
p221
aVSo this is the infamous
p222
aVCaulerpa taxifolia,
p223
aVthe so-called killer algae.
p224
aVA book was written about it.
p225
aVIt's a bit of an embarrassment.
p226
aVIt was accidentally released
p227
aVfrom the aquarium in Monaco,
p228
aVit was bred to be cold tolerant
p229
aVto have in peoples aquaria.
p230
aVIt's very pretty,
p231
aVand it has rapidly started
p232
aVto overgrow
p233
aVthe once very rich
p234
aVbiodiversity of the
p235
aVnorthwestern Mediterranean.
p236
aVI don't know how many of you remember the movie
p237
aV"The Little Shop of Horrors,"
p238
aVbut this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."
p239
aVBut, instead of devouring the people in the shop,
p240
aVwhat it's doing is overgrowing
p241
aVand smothering
p242
aVvirtually all of the bottom-dwelling life
p243
aVof the entire northwestern
p244
aVMediterranean Sea.
p245
aVWe don't know anything that eats it,
p246
aVwe're trying to do all sorts of genetics
p247
aVand figure out something that could be done,
p248
aVbut, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,
p249
aVabout which nobody knows what to do.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow another form of pollution
p252
aVthat's biological pollution
p253
aVis what happens from excess nutrients.
p254
aVThe green revolution,
p255
aVall of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
p256
aVIt's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
p257
aVIt runs down the rivers,
p258
aVand it feeds the plankton,
p259
aVthe little microscopic plant cells
p260
aVin the coastal water.
p261
aVBut since we ate all the oysters
p262
aVand we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,
p263
aVthere's nothing to eat the plankton
p264
aVand there's more and more of it,
p265
aVso it dies of old age,
p266
aVwhich is unheard of for plankton.
p267
aVAnd when it dies, it falls to the bottom
p268
aVand then it rots,
p269
aVwhich means that bacteria break it down.
p270
aVAnd in the process
p271
aVthey use up all the oxygen,
p272
aVand in using up all the oxygen
p273
aVthey make the environment utterly lethal
p274
aVfor anything that can't swim away.
p275
aVSo, what we end up with
p276
aVis a microbial zoo
p277
aVdominated by bacteria
p278
aVand jellyfish, as you see
p279
aVon the left in front of you.
p280
aVAnd the only fishery left \u2014
p281
aVand it is a commercial fishery \u2014
p282
aVis the jellyfish fishery
p283
aVyou see on the right, where there used to be prawns.
p284
aVEven in Newfoundland
p285
aVwhere we used to catch cod,
p286
aVwe now have a jellyfish fishery.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd another version of this sort of thing
p289
aVis what is often called red tides
p290
aVor toxic blooms.
p291
aVThat picture on the left is just staggering to me.
p292
aVI have talked about it a million times,
p293
aVbut it's unbelievable.
p294
aVIn the upper right of that picture on the left
p295
aVis almost the Mississippi Delta,
p296
aVand the lower left of that picture
p297
aVis the Texas-Mexico border.
p298
aVYou're looking at the entire
p299
aVnorthwestern Gulf of Mexico;
p300
aVyou're looking at one toxic
p301
aVdinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,
p302
aVmade by that beautiful little creature
p303
aVon the lower right.
p304
aVAnd in the upper right you see this
p305
aVblack sort of cloud
p306
aVmoving ashore.
p307
aVThat's the same species.
p308
aVAnd as it comes to shore and the wind blows,
p309
aVand little droplets of the water get into the air,
p310
aVthe emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
p311
aVwith people with acute respiratory distress.
p312
aVAnd that's retirement homes
p313
aVon the west coast of Florida.
p314
aVA friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
p315
aVwe called Hollywood ocean night,
p316
aVand I was trying to figure out how to
p317
aVexplain to actors what's going on.
p318
aVAnd I said,
p319
aV"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'
p320
aVbecause all the beautiful people have moved
p321
aVto North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.
p322
aVAnd the only people who are left there
p323
aVare the people who can't afford
p324
aVto move away from the coast,
p325
aVbecause the coast, instead of being paradise,
p326
aVis harmful to your health."
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd then this is amazing.
p329
aVIt was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
p330
aVThis is from the coast of Brittany,
p331
aVwhich is being enveloped
p332
aVin this green, algal slime.
p333
aVThe reason that it attracted so much attention,
p334
aVbesides the fact that it's disgusting,
p335
aVis that sea birds flying over it
p336
aVare asphyxiated by the smell and die,
p337
aVand a farmer died of it,
p338
aVand you can imagine the scandal that happened.
p339
aVAnd so there's this war
p340
aVbetween the farmers
p341
aVand the fishermen about it all,
p342
aVand the net result is that
p343
aVthe beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
p344
aVon a regular basis.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd then, of course, there's climate change,
p347
aVand we all know about climate change.
p348
aVI guess the iconic figure of it
p349
aVis the melting of the ice
p350
aVin the Arctic Sea.
p351
aVThink about the thousands and thousands of people who died
p352
aVtrying to find the Northwest Passage.
p353
aVWell, the Northwest Passage is already there.
p354
aVI think it's sort of funny;
p355
aVit's on the Siberian coast,
p356
aVmaybe the Russians will charge tolls.
p357
aVThe governments of the world
p358
aVare taking this really seriously.
p359
aVThe military of the Arctic nations
p360
aVis taking it really seriously.
p361
aVFor all the denial of climate change
p362
aVby government leaders,
p363
aVthe CIA
p364
aVand the navies of Norway
p365
aVand the U.S. and Canada, whatever
p366
aVare busily thinking about
p367
aVhow they will secure their territory
p368
aVin this inevitability
p369
aVfrom their point of view.
p370
aVAnd, of course, Arctic communities are toast.
p371
aa(lp372
VThe other kinds of effects of climate change \u2014
p373
aVthis is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?
p374
aVAll that white coral.
p375
aVExcept it's supposed to be brown.
p376
aVWhat happens is that
p377
aVthe corals are a symbiosis,
p378
aVand they have these little algal cells
p379
aVthat live inside them.
p380
aVAnd the algae give the corals sugar,
p381
aVand the corals give the algae
p382
aVnutrients and protection.
p383
aVBut when it gets too hot,
p384
aVthe algae can't make the sugar.
p385
aVThe corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."
p386
aVThey kick them out, and then they die.
p387
aVNot all of them die; some of them survive,
p388
aVsome more are surviving,
p389
aVbut it's really bad news.
p390
aVTo try and give you a sense of this,
p391
aVimagine you go camping in July
p392
aVsomewhere in Europe or in North America,
p393
aVand you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,
p394
aVand you see that 80 percent of the trees,
p395
aVas far as you can see,
p396
aVhave dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.
p397
aVAnd you come home, and you discover
p398
aVthat 80 percent of all the trees
p399
aVin North America and in Europe
p400
aVhave dropped their leaves.
p401
aVAnd then you read in the paper a few weeks later,
p402
aV"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."
p403
aVWell, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean
p404
aVduring the 1998 El Nino,
p405
aVan area vastly greater
p406
aVthan the size of North America and Europe,
p407
aVwhen 80 percent of all the corals bleached
p408
aVand a quarter of them died.
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd then the really scary thing
p411
aVabout all of this \u2014
p412
aVthe overfishing, the pollution and the climate change \u2014
p413
aVis that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.
p414
aVBut there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,
p415
aVthe synergies among them
p416
aVthat make the whole vastly greater
p417
aVthan the sum of the parts.
p418
aVAnd the great scientific challenge
p419
aVfor people like me in thinking about all this,
p420
aVis do we know how
p421
aVto put Humpty Dumpty back together again?
p422
aVI mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.
p423
aVBut what does that mean?
p424
aVWe really don't know.
p425
aa(lp426
VSo what are the oceans going to be like
p427
aVin 20 or 50 years?
p428
aVWell, there won't be any fish
p429
aVexcept for minnows,
p430
aVand the water will be pretty dirty,
p431
aVand all those kinds of things
p432
aVand full of mercury, etc., etc.
p433
aVAnd dead zones will get bigger and bigger
p434
aVand they'll start to merge,
p435
aVand we can imagine something like
p436
aVthe dead-zonification
p437
aVof the global, coastal ocean.
p438
aVThen you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,
p439
aVbecause it would be a kind of
p440
aVgastronomic Russian roulette.
p441
aVSometimes you have a toxic bloom;
p442
aVsometimes you don't.
p443
aVThat doesn't sell.
p444
aa(lp445
VThe really scary things though
p446
aVare the physical, chemical,
p447
aVoceanographic things that are happening.
p448
aVAs the surface of the ocean gets warmer,
p449
aVthe water is lighter when it's warmer,
p450
aVit becomes harder and harder
p451
aVto turn the ocean over.
p452
aVWe say it becomes
p453
aVmore strongly stratified.
p454
aVThe consequence of that is that
p455
aVall those nutrients
p456
aVthat fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,
p457
aVof the sardines of California
p458
aVor in Peru or whatever,
p459
aVthose slow down
p460
aVand those fisheries collapse.
p461
aVAnd, at the same time,
p462
aVwater from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,
p463
aVdoesn't make it down
p464
aVand the ocean turns into a desert.
p465
aa(lp466
VSo the question is: How are we all
p467
aVgoing to respond to this?
p468
aVAnd we can do
p469
aVall sorts of things to fix it,
p470
aVbut in the final analysis,
p471
aVthe thing we really need to fix
p472
aVis ourselves.
p473
aVIt's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;
p474
aVit's not about the climate change.
p475
aVIt's about us
p476
aVand our greed and our need for growth
p477
aVand our inability to imagine a world
p478
aVthat is different from the selfish world
p479
aVwe live in today.
p480
aVSo the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
p481
aVI would say that the future of life
p482
aVand the dignity of human beings
p483
aVdepends on our doing that.
p484
