V\u266b When I wake up \u266b
p9
aV\u266b in the morning \u266b
p10
aV\u266b I pour the coffee \u266b
p11
aV\u266b I read the paper \u266b
p12
aV\u266b And then I slowly \u266b
p13
aV\u266b and so softly \u266b
p14
aV\u266b do the dishes \u266b
p15
aV\u266b So feed the fishes \u266b
p16
aV\u266b You sing me happy birthday \u266b
p17
aV\u266b Like it's gonna be \u266b
p18
aV\u266b your last day \u266b
p19
aV\u266b here on Earth \u266b
p20
aa(lp21
V(Applause)
p22
aa(lp23
VAll right.
p24
aVSo, I wanted to do something special today.
p25
aVI want to debut a new song that I've been working on
p26
aVin the last five or six months.
p27
aVAnd there's few things more thrilling
p28
aVthan playing a song
p29
aVfor the first time in front of an audience,
p30
aVespecially when it's half-finished.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVI'm kind of hoping some conversations here
p33
aVmight help me finish it.
p34
aVBecause it gets into all sorts
p35
aVof crazy realms.
p36
aVAnd so this is basically a song
p37
aVabout loops,
p38
aVbut not the kind of loops that I make up here.
p39
aVThey're feedback loops.
p40
aVAnd in the audio world
p41
aVthat's when the microphone gets too close
p42
aVto its sound source,
p43
aVand then it gets in this self-destructive loop
p44
aVthat creates a very unpleasant sound.
p45
aVAnd I'm going to demonstrate for you.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVI'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.
p48
aa(lp49
V\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p50
aV\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p51
aV\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p52
aV\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p53
aV\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p54
aV\u266b This is a loop, feedback loop \u266b
p55
aV\u266b This is a \u2014 (Feedback)
p56
aa(lp57
VAll right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate \u2014
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aV\u2014 but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd I've been thinking about
p62
aVhow that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,
p63
aVfrom, say, the ecological, okay.
p64
aVThere seems to be a rule in nature
p65
aVthat if you get too close to where you came from,
p66
aVit gets ugly.
p67
aVSo like, you can't feed cows their own brains
p68
aVor you get mad cow disease,
p69
aVand inbreeding and incest
p70
aVand, let's see,
p71
aVwhat's the other one?
p72
aVBiological \u2014 there's autoimmune diseases,
p73
aVwhere the body attacks itself
p74
aVa little too overzealously
p75
aVand destroys the host,
p76
aVor the person.
p77
aVAnd then \u2014 okay, this is where we get to the song \u2014
p78
aVkind of bridges the gap to the emotional.
p79
aa(lp80
VBecause although I've used scientific terms
p81
aVin songs,
p82
aVit's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.
p83
aVAnd there's some things
p84
aVyou just don't need to have in songs.
p85
aVSo I'm trying to bridge this gap
p86
aVbetween this idea and this melody.
p87
aVAnd so, I don't know if you've ever had this,
p88
aVbut when I close my eyes sometimes
p89
aVand try to sleep,
p90
aVI can't stop thinking about my own eyes.
p91
aVAnd it's like your eyes
p92
aVstart straining to see themselves.
p93
aVThat's what it feels like to me.
p94
aVIt's not pleasant.
p95
aVI'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVIt's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,
p98
aVbut they seem to be trying.
p99
aVSo that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.
p100
aVOr ears being able to hear themselves \u2014
p101
aVit's just impossible.
p102
aVThat's the thing.
p103
aVSo, I've been working on this song
p104
aVthat mentions these things
p105
aVand then also imagines
p106
aVa person who's been so successful
p107
aVat defending themselves from heartbreak
p108
aVthat they're left to do the deed themselves,
p109
aVif that's possible.
p110
aVAnd that's what the song is asking.
p111
aVAll right.
p112
aVIt doesn't have a name yet.

V\u266b Go ahead and congratulate yourself \u266b
p117
aV\u266b Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand \u266b
p118
aV\u266b And the eye that eyes itself is your eye \u266b
p119
aV\u266b And the ear that hears itself is near \u266b
p120
aV\u266b 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh \u266b
p121
aV\u266b You've done the impossible now \u266b
p122
aV\u266b Took yourself apart \u266b
p123
aV\u266b You made yourself invulnerable \u266b
p124
aV\u266b No one can break your heart \u266b
p125
aV\u266b So you wear it out \u266b
p126
aV\u266b And you wring it out \u266b
p127
aV\u266b And you wear it out \u266b
p128
aV\u266b And you break it yourself \u266b
p129
aV\u266b Breaking your own, break it yourself \u266b
p130
aV\u266b Breaking your own, break it yourself \u266b
p131
aV\u266b Breaking your own \u266b
p132
aV(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VThanks.
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aVAll right.
p137
aVIt's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.
p138
aVYou can throw out crazy theories
p139
aVand not have to back it up with data
p140
aVor graphs or research.
p141
aVBut, you know, I think reckless curiosity
p142
aVwould be what the world needs now,
p143
aVjust a little bit.
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVI'm going to finish up with a song of mine
p146
aVcalled "Weather Systems."
