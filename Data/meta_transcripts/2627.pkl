VHi.
p4
aa(lp5
VThank you.
p6
aa(lp7
V[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.
p8
aVThe live audience was asked to applaud ASL-style, in silence.]
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, five years ago, this was me.
p11
aVI was a PhD student at Harvard,
p12
aVand I loved to travel.
p13
aVI had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life.
p14
aVI was 28, and like so many of us when we are in good health,
p15
aVI felt like I was invincible.
p16
aa(lp17
VThen one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees.
p18
aVI probably should have gone to the doctor,
p19
aVbut I'd never really been sick in my life,
p20
aVand I knew that usually, if you have a virus,
p21
aVyou stay home and you make some chicken soup,
p22
aVand in a few days, everything will be fine.
p23
aVBut this time it wasn't fine.
p24
aVAfter the fever broke,
p25
aVfor three weeks I was so dizzy, I couldn't leave my house.
p26
aVI would walk straight into door frames.
p27
aVI had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom.
p28
aVThat spring I got infection after infection,
p29
aVand every time I went to the doctor,
p30
aVhe said there was absolutely nothing wrong.
p31
aVHe had his laboratory tests,
p32
aVwhich always came back normal.
p33
aVAll I had were my symptoms,
p34
aVwhich I could describe,
p35
aVbut no one else can see.
p36
aVI know it sounds silly,
p37
aVbut you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself,
p38
aVand so I thought maybe I was just aging.
p39
aVMaybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThen the neurological symptoms started.
p44
aVSometimes I would find that I couldn't draw the right side of a circle.
p45
aVOther times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all.
p46
aVI saw every kind of specialist:
p47
aVinfectious disease doctors, dermatologists, endocrinologists,
p48
aVcardiologists.
p49
aVI even saw a psychiatrist.
p50
aVMy psychiatrist said, "It's clear you're really sick,
p51
aVbut not with anything psychiatric.
p52
aVI hope they can find out what's wrong with you."
p53
aa(lp54
VThe next day, my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder.
p55
aVHe told me that everything \u2014
p56
aVthe fevers, the sore throats, the sinus infection,
p57
aVall of the gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiac symptoms \u2014
p58
aVwere being caused by some distant emotional trauma
p59
aVthat I could not remember.
p60
aVThe symptoms were real, he said,
p61
aVbut they had no biological cause.
p62
aa(lp63
VI was training to be a social scientist.
p64
aVI had studied statistics, probability theory,
p65
aVmathematical modeling, experimental design.
p66
aVI felt like I couldn't just reject my neurologist's diagnosis.
p67
aVIt didn't feel true,
p68
aVbut I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive,
p69
aVso easily obscured by what we want to believe.
p70
aVSo I had to consider the possibility that he was right.
p71
aa(lp72
VThat day, I ran a small experiment.
p73
aVI walked back the two miles from my neurologist's office to my house,
p74
aVmy legs wrapped in this strange, almost electric kind of pain.
p75
aVI meditated on that pain,
p76
aVcontemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this.
p77
aVAs soon as I walked through the door,
p78
aVI collapsed.
p79
aVMy brain and my spinal cord were burning.
p80
aVMy neck was so stiff I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,
p81
aVand the slightest sound \u2014
p82
aVthe rustling of the sheets,
p83
aVmy husband walking barefoot in the next room \u2014
p84
aVcould cause excruciating pain.
p85
aVI would spend most of the next two years in bed.
p86
aa(lp87
VHow could my doctor have gotten it so wrong?
p88
aVI thought I had a rare disease,
p89
aVsomething doctors had never seen.
p90
aVAnd then I went online
p91
aVand found thousands of people all over the world
p92
aVliving with the same symptoms,
p93
aVsimilarly isolated,
p94
aVsimilarly disbelieved.
p95
aVSome could still work,
p96
aVbut had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed,
p97
aVjust so they could show up the next Monday.
p98
aVOn the other end of the spectrum,
p99
aVsome were so sick
p100
aVthey had to live in complete darkness,
p101
aVunable to tolerate the sound of a human voice
p102
aVor the touch of a loved one.
p103
aa(lp104
VI was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis.
p105
aVYou've probably heard it called "chronic fatigue syndrome."
p106
aVFor decades, that's a name
p107
aVthat's meant that this
p108
aVhas been the dominant image
p109
aVof a disease that can be as serious as this.
p110
aVThe key symptom we all share
p111
aVis that whenever we exert ourselves \u2014 physically, mentally \u2014
p112
aVwe pay and we pay hard.
p113
aVIf my husband goes for a run, he might be sore for a couple of days.
p114
aVIf I try to walk half a block, I might be bedridden for a week.
p115
aVIt is a perfect custom prison.
p116
aVI know ballet dancers who can't dance,
p117
aVaccountants who can't add,
p118
aVmedical students who never became doctors.
p119
aVIt doesn't matter what you once were;
p120
aVyou can't do it anymore.
p121
aVIt's been four years,
p122
aVand I've still never been as well as I was
p123
aVthe minute before I walked home from my neurologist's office.
p124
aa(lp125
VIt's estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world
p126
aVhave this disease.
p127
aVIn the US, where I'm from, it's about one million people.
p128
aVThat makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis.
p129
aVPatients can live for decades with the physical function
p130
aVof someone with congestive heart failure.
p131
aVTwenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden,
p132
aVand 75 to 85 percent of us can't even work part-time.
p133
aVYet doctors do not treat us
p134
aVand science does not study us.
p135
aVHow could a disease this common and this devastating
p136
aVhave been forgotten by medicine?
p137
aa(lp138
VWhen my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder,
p139
aVhe was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies
p140
aVthat are over 2,500 years old.
p141
aVThe Roman physician Galen thought
p142
aVthat hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation
p143
aVin particularly passionate women.
p144
aVThe Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up
p145
aVand wander around the body in search of moisture,
p146
aVpressing on internal organs \u2014
p147
aVyes \u2014
p148
aVcausing symptoms from extreme emotions
p149
aVto dizziness and paralysis.
p150
aVThe cure was marriage and motherhood.
p151
aa(lp152
VThese ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s,
p153
aVwhen neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria.
p154
aVSigmund Freud developed a theory
p155
aVthat the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms
p156
aVwhen dealing with memories or emotions
p157
aVtoo painful for the conscious mind to handle.
p158
aVIt converted these emotions into physical symptoms.
p159
aVThis meant that men could now get hysteria,
p160
aVbut of course women were still the most susceptible.
p161
aa(lp162
VWhen I began investigating the history of my own disease,
p163
aVI was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run.
p164
aVIn 1934,
p165
aV198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital
p166
aVbecame seriously ill.
p167
aVThey had muscle weakness, stiffness in the neck and back, fevers \u2014
p168
aVall of the same symptoms I had when I first got diagnosed.
p169
aVDoctors thought it was a new form of polio.
p170
aVSince then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented
p171
aVaround the world,
p172
aVof a strikingly similar post-infectious disease.
p173
aVAll of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women,
p174
aVand in time, when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease,
p175
aVthey thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhy has this idea had such staying power?
p178
aVI do think it has to do with sexism,
p179
aVbut I also think that fundamentally, doctors want to help.
p180
aVThey want to know the answer,
p181
aVand this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable,
p182
aVto explain illnesses that have no explanation.
p183
aVThe problem is that this can cause real harm.
p184
aVIn the 1950s, a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater
p185
aVstudied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria.
p186
aVNine years later, 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled.
p187
aVMany had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis,
p188
aVepilepsy, brain tumors.
p189
aVIn 1980, hysteria was officially renamed "conversion disorder."
p190
aVWhen my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in 2012,
p191
aVhe was echoing Freud's words verbatim,
p192
aVand even today,
p193
aVwomen are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive that diagnosis.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness
p196
aVis that it can never be proven.
p197
aVIt is by definition the absence of evidence,
p198
aVand in the case of ME,
p199
aVpsychological explanations have held back biological research.
p200
aVAll around the world, ME is one of the least funded diseases.
p201
aVIn the US, we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,
p202
aV250 dollars per MS patient
p203
aVand just 5 dollars per year per ME patient.
p204
aVThis was not just lightning.
p205
aVI was not just unlucky.
p206
aVThe ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice,
p207
aVa choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us.
p208
aa(lp209
VWe don't know why ME sometimes runs in families,
p210
aVwhy you can get it after almost any infection,
p211
aVfrom enteroviruses to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,
p212
aVor why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men.
p213
aVThis issue is much bigger than just my disease.
p214
aVWhen I first got sick,
p215
aVold friends were reaching out to me.
p216
aVI soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s
p217
aVwhose bodies were falling apart.
p218
aVWhat was striking was just how much trouble we were having
p219
aVbeing taken seriously.
p220
aa(lp221
VI learned of one woman with scleroderma,
p222
aVan autoimmune connective tissue disease,
p223
aVwho was told for years that it was all in her head.
p224
aVBetween the time of onset and diagnosis,
p225
aVher esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,
p226
aVshe will never be able to eat again.
p227
aVAnother woman with ovarian cancer,
p228
aVwho for years was told that it was just early menopause.
p229
aVA friend from college,
p230
aVwhose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety.
p231
aa(lp232
VHere's why this worries me:
p233
aVsince the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases
p234
aVhave doubled to tripled.
p235
aVForty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed
p236
aVwith a recognized autoimmune disease
p237
aVare initially told they're hypochondriacs.
p238
aVLike the hysteria of old, this has everything to do with gender
p239
aVand with whose stories we believe.
p240
aVSeventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women,
p241
aVand in some diseases, it's as high as 90 percent.
p242
aVEven though these diseases disproportionately affect women,
p243
aVthey are not women's diseases.
p244
aVME affects children and ME affects millions of men.
p245
aVAnd as one patient told me,
p246
aVwe get it coming and going \u2014
p247
aVif you're a woman, you're told you're exaggerating your symptoms,
p248
aVbut if you're a guy, you're told to be strong, to buck up.
p249
aVAnd men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed.
p250
aa(lp251
VMy brain is not what it used to be.
p252
aa(lp253
VHere's the good part:
p254
aVdespite everything, I still have hope.
p255
aVSo many diseases were once thought of as psychological
p256
aVuntil science uncovered their biological mechanisms.
p257
aVPatients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized
p258
aVuntil the EEG was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
p259
aVMultiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis
p260
aVuntil the CAT scan and the MRI discovered brain lesions.
p261
aVAnd recently, we used to think
p262
aVthat stomach ulcers were just caused by stress,
p263
aVuntil we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit.
p264
aVME has never benefited from the kind of science
p265
aVthat other diseases have had,
p266
aVbut that's starting to change.
p267
aVIn Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity,
p268
aVand in Japan, of brain inflammation.
p269
aVIn the US, scientists at Stanford are finding abnormalities
p270
aVin energy metabolism
p271
aVthat are 16 standard deviations away from normal.
p272
aVAnd in Norway, researchers are running a phase-3 clinical trial
p273
aVon a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission.
p274
aa(lp275
VWhat also gives me hope
p276
aVis the resilience of patients.
p277
aVOnline we came together,
p278
aVand we shared our stories.
p279
aVWe devoured what research there was.
p280
aVWe experimented on ourselves.
p281
aVWe became our own scientists and our own doctors
p282
aVbecause we had to be.
p283
aVAnd slowly I added five percent here, five percent there,
p284
aVuntil eventually, on a good day,
p285
aVI was able to leave my home.
p286
aVI still had to make ridiculous choices:
p287
aVWill I sit in the garden for 15 minutes, or will I wash my hair today?
p288
aVBut it gave me hope that I could be treated.
p289
aVI had a sick body; that was all.
p290
aVAnd with the right kind of help, maybe one day I could get better.
p291
aa(lp292
VI came together with patients around the world,
p293
aVand we started to fight.
p294
aVWe have filled the void with something wonderful,
p295
aVbut it is not enough.
p296
aVI still don't know if I will ever be able to run again,
p297
aVor walk at any distance,
p298
aVor do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams.
p299
aVBut I am so grateful for how far I have come.
p300
aVProgress is slow,
p301
aVand it is up
p302
aVand it is down,
p303
aVbut I am getting a little better each day.
p304
aa(lp305
VI remember what it was like when I was stuck in that bedroom,
p306
aVwhen it had been months since I had seen the sun.
p307
aVI thought that I would die there.
p308
aVBut here I am today,
p309
aVwith you,
p310
aVand that is a miracle.
p311
aa(lp312
VI don't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones,
p313
aVhad I gotten sick before the internet,
p314
aVhad I not found my community.
p315
aVI probably would have already taken my own life,
p316
aVas so many others have done.
p317
aVHow many lives could we have saved, decades ago,
p318
aVif we had asked the right questions?
p319
aVHow many lives could we save today
p320
aVif we decide to make a real start?
p321
aa(lp322
VEven once the true cause of my disease is discovered,
p323
aVif we don't change our institutions and our culture,
p324
aVwe will do this again to another disease.
p325
aVLiving with this illness has taught me
p326
aVthat science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors.
p327
aVDoctors, scientists and policy makers
p328
aVare not immune to the same biases
p329
aVthat affect all of us.
p330
aa(lp331
VWe need to think in more nuanced ways about women's health.
p332
aVOur immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality
p333
aVas the rest of our bodies.
p334
aVWe need to listen to patients' stories,
p335
aVand we need to be willing to say, "I don't know."
p336
aV"I don't know" is a beautiful thing.
p337
aV"I don't know" is where discovery starts.
p338
aVAnd if we can do that,
p339
aVif we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know,
p340
aVand then, rather than fear uncertainty,
p341
aVmaybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder.
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you.
p344
aa(lp345
VThank you.
