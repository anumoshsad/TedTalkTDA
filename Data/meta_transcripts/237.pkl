VI'm delighted to be here.
p4
aVI'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.
p5
aVI would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,
p6
aVbut unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in
p7
aVwon't interest many other people.
p8
aVFirst off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
p9
aVI would love to talk about my astronomy,
p10
aVbut I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer
p11
aVin non-gray atmospheres
p12
aVand polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere
p13
aVare the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.
p14
aVSo I'm not going to talk about that.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIt would be just as much fun
p18
aVto talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,
p19
aVwhen a computer hacker is breaking into our systems
p20
aVover at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
p21
aVAnd I caught the guys,
p22
aVand they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,
p23
aVand stealing information and selling it.
p24
aVAnd I'd love to talk about that \u2014 and it'd be fun \u2014
p25
aVbut, 20 years later ...
p26
aVI find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.
p27
aVIt's tedious.
p28
aVI'm \u2014
p29
aa(lp30
VThe first time you do something, it's science.
p31
aVThe second time, it's engineering.
p32
aVA third time, it's just being a technician.
p33
aVI'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.
p34
aVSo, I'm not going to talk about that.
p35
aVNor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,
p36
aV"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,
p37
aVnor am I going to talk about
p38
aVwhy I believe computers don't belong in schools.
p39
aa(lp40
VI feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around
p41
aVthat we have to bring more computers into schools.
p42
aVMy idea is: no! No!
p43
aVGet them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.
p44
aVAnd I'd love to talk about this,
p45
aVbut I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom
p46
aVthat it doesn't need much talking about \u2014
p47
aVbut I guess I may be very wrong about that,
p48
aVand everything else that I've said.
p49
aVSo don't go back and read my dissertation.
p50
aVIt probably has lies in it as well.
p51
aa(lp52
VHaving said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVAnd if you look at it over here,
p55
aVthe main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.
p56
aVI'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
p57
aVOh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,
p58
aVbecause I've got gray hair,
p59
aVand so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.
p60
aVIn fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,
p61
aVif you really want to know about the future,
p62
aVdon't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.
p63
aVNo! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.
p64
aa(lp65
VNo, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,
p66
aVask a kindergarten teacher.
p67
aVThey know.
p68
aVIn fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,
p69
aVask an experienced one.
p70
aVThey're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.
p71
aVI don't. Nor, I suspect,
p72
aVdo many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.
p73
aVCertainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things
p74
aVthat are going to be there.
p75
aVBut to me, things aren't the future.
p76
aVWhat I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,
p77
aVwhen the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging
p78
aVand spend a huge amount of on-screen time,
p79
aVbut have never gone bowling together?
p80
aa(lp81
VChange is happening, and the change that is happening
p82
aVis not one that is in software.
p83
aVBut that's not what I'm going to talk about.
p84
aVI'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,
p85
aVbut I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?
p86
aVOh \u2014 the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about
p87
aVis right over here. Right over here.
p88
aVIs that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.
p89
aVI would dearly love to talk about
p90
aVthings that have one side.
p91
aVBecause I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,
p92
aVbut I'm one of the very few people,
p93
aVif not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.
p94
aVRight away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.
p95
aVThis is a Klein bottle.
p96
aVFor those of you in the audience who know,
p97
aVyou roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.
p98
aVIt's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.
p99
aVIt has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
p100
aVIt has wonderful properties.
p101
aVIf you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,
p102
aVyou get one of these, and I make them out of glass.
p103
aVAnd I'd love to talk to you about this,
p104
aVbut I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because \u2014
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
V(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)
p108
aa(lp109
VHowever, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.
p110
aVJust two weeks ago I made \u2014
p111
aVyou know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.
p112
aVBut what I've just made \u2014
p113
aVand I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.
p114
aVThis is a Klein bottle wine bottle,
p115
aVwhich, although in four dimensions
p116
aVit shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,
p117
aVit's perfectly capable of doing so
p118
aVbecause our universe has only three spatial dimensions.
p119
aVAnd because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,
p120
aVit can hold fluids.
p121
aVSo it's highly \u2014 that one's the cool one.
p122
aVThat was a month of my life.
p123
aVBut although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VInstead, I'm going to mention my mom,
p127
aVwho passed away last summer.
p128
aVHad collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.
p129
aVCould somebody put this guy up?
p130
aVAnd I looked over her album
p131
aVand she had collected a picture of me, standing \u2014
p132
aVwell, sitting \u2014 in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.
p133
aVAnd I looked at it, and said, oh my god,
p134
aVthat was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!
p135
aVAs a technician, repairing and maintaining
p136
aVthe electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!
p137
aVWay back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
p138
aVAnd it sent me back.
p139
aa(lp140
VSoon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.
p141
aVThis guy over here of course is me.
p142
aVThis man is Robert Moog,
p143
aVthe inventor of the Moog synthesizer,
p144
aVwho passed away this past August.
p145
aVRobert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.
p146
aVA musician who took time from his life to teach me,
p147
aVa sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.
p148
aVHe'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me
p149
aVnot just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there \u2014
p150
aVI'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.
p151
aVWe're studying physics, I'm studying physics,
p152
aVand he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.
p153
aVDon't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."
p154
aVMentoring me. He'd come up and
p155
aVspend hours and hours with me.
p156
aVHe wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.
p157
aVIn the background, my bicycle.
p158
aVI realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.
p159
aVBob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment
p160
aVto show Greg Flint and I things about this.
p161
aVWe sat around talking about Fourier transforms,
p162
aVBessel functions, modulation transfer functions,
p163
aVstuff like this.
p164
aVBob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.
p165
aVAnyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.
p166
aV(Applause)
p167
aVAnd I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do \u2014
p168
aVI hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,
p169
aValmost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.
p170
aa(lp171
VOh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?
p172
aVKids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about \u2014 is that okay?
p173
aVIt says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.
p174
aVI've decided that, for me at least,
p175
aVI don't have a big enough head.
p176
aVSo I think locally and I act locally.
p177
aVI feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.
p178
aVSo Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.
p179
aVI was talking about this stuff to
p180
aVsome schoolteachers about a year ago.
p181
aVAnd one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,
p182
aV"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"
p183
aVAnd I said, "Well, I've taught graduate \u2014
p184
aVI've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."
p185
aVNo, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,
p186
aVhow come you ain't over here on the front lines?
p187
aVPut your money where you mouth is."
p188
aa(lp189
VIs true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.
p190
aVNot just showing up every now and then.
p191
aVNo, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.
p192
aVI take lunch hour. (Applause)
p193
aVThis is not \u2014 no, no, no, this is not claps.
p194
aVI strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.
p195
aVNot just show up to class every now and then.
p196
aVTeach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.
p197
aVOne of the things that I've done for my science students
p198
aVis to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.
p199
aVNo calculus, I'll cut out that.
p200
aVYou won't need to know trig.
p201
aVBut you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,
p202
aVand we're going to do serious experiments.
p203
aVNone of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.
p204
aVWe're going to be doing genuine physics."
p205
aVAnd that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.
p206
aV(High-pitched tone)
p207
aa(lp208
VOh, before I even turn that on,
p209
aVone of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class \u2014
p210
aVthis is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for
p211
aVwas to measure the speed of light.
p212
aVMy students in El Cerrito \u2014 with my help, of course,
p213
aVand with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope \u2014
p214
aVmeasured the speed of light.
p215
aVWe were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of
p216
aVwho have measured the speed of light?
p217
aVIn addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.
p218
aVI'd love to measure the speed of light here.
p219
aVI was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"
p220
aVI was just going to impose upon the powers that be,
p221
aVand measure the speed of light.
p222
aVAnd I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,
p223
aVbut then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!
p224
aVAnd there's no time to do it.
p225
aVSo, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!
p226
aa(lp227
VBut meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!
p228
aVWell, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound
p229
aVis to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.
p230
aVBut, probably \u2014 one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,
p231
aV"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"
p232
aVAnd all of you know the wave equation is
p233
aVthe frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
p234
aVis a constant. When the frequency goes up,
p235
aVthe wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,
p236
aVfrequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here \u2014
p237
aVover here, that's what's interesting \u2014
p238
aVas the pitch goes up, things get closer,
p239
aVpitch goes down, things stretch out.
p240
aVRight? This is simple physics.
p241
aVAll of you know this from eighth grade, remember?
p242
aVWhat they didn't tell you in physics \u2014 in eighth-grade physics \u2014
p243
aVbut they should have, and I wish they had,
p244
aVwas that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound
p245
aVor light, you get a constant.
p246
aVAnd that constant is the speed of sound.
p247
aVSo, in order to measure the speed of sound,
p248
aVall I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
p249
aVI've got a frequency counter right here.
p250
aVSet it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.
p251
aVNow, so I know the frequency.
p252
aVIt's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.
p253
aVAll I need now is to flip on another beam,
p254
aVand the bottom beam is me talking, right?
p255
aVSo anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
p256
aVI'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,
p257
aVyou'll notice the spiral.
p258
aVThe slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,
p259
aVcoming out this way.
p260
aVThose of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,
p261
aVbut bear with me. (Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VTo measure the wavelength,
p264
aVall I need to do is measure the distance from here \u2014
p265
aVone full wave \u2014 over to here.
p266
aVFrom here to here is the wavelength of sound.
p267
aVSo, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.
p268
aVI've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.
p269
aV0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.
p270
aVOK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.
p271
aVAnd we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.
p272
aVThe wavelength was 0.2 meters.
p273
aVLet's figure out what this is.
p274
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p275
aV1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.
p276
aVIf you look it up in the book, it's really 343.
p277
aVBut, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink \u2014
p278
aVwe've been able to measure the speed of sound to \u2014
p279
aVnot bad. Pretty good.
p280
aa(lp281
VAll of which comes to what I wanted to say.
p282
aVGo back to this picture of me a million years ago.
p283
aVIt was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,
p284
aVand I'm like, "Oh my God!"
p285
aVI'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.
p286
aVI'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.
p287
aVThere's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
p288
aVThere's a riot going on on campus,
p289
aVand the police are chasing me, right?
p290
aVI'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,
p291
aV"You! You're a student."
p292
aVPulls out a gun. Goes boom!
p293
aVAnd a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!
p294
aVI get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.
p295
aVThis cop comes after me with a rifle.
p296
aVHe wants to clunk me over the head!
p297
aVI'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"
p298
aVI go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.
p299
aVIt's one of these bell-tower buildings.
p300
aVThe cop's chasing me.
p301
aVChasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.
p302
aVChases me into this room.
p303
aVThe entranceway to the bell tower.
p304
aVI slam the door behind me, climb up,
p305
aVgo past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.
p306
aVAnd I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,
p307
aVthe square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VI keep climbing up, go back.
p310
aVI go to a place where a dowel splits off.
p311
aVThere's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
p312
aVThe time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.
p313
aVI'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.
p314
aVI climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,
p315
aVthat you climb up this wooden ladder.
p316
aVI pop up the top, and there's a cupola.
p317
aVA dome, one of these ten-foot domes.
p318
aVI'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,
p319
aVshooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.
p320
aVAnd I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"
p321
aVThen I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
p322
aVNamely, that when they cast bells,
p323
aVthey write inscriptions on them.
p324
aVSo, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.
p325
aVI'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"
p326
aa(lp327
VSo, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed
p328
aVupon the Hayes Hall tower bells:
p329
aV"All truth is one.
p330
aVIn this light, may science and religion endeavor here
p331
aVfor the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,
p332
aVfrom narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.
p333
aVIt is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."
