VOn September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,
p4
aVI came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes
p5
aVand my father was reading the paper or something,
p6
aVand I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,
p7
aV"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
p8
aVAnd my father smiled and said,
p9
aV"Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
p10
aVAnd I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party
p11
aVand a cake and get a lot of presents?"
p12
aVAnd my dad said, "Well, yes.
p13
aVBut more importantly,
p14
aVbeing seven means that you've reached the age of reason,
p15
aVand you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
p20
aVSister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about
p21
aVmy second-grade class at school.
p22
aVBut when she said it,
p23
aVthe phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations
p24
aVfor our first communion and our first confession,
p25
aVand everybody knew that was really all about the white dress
p26
aVand the white veil.
p27
aVAnd anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention
p28
aVto that phrase, "age of reason."
p29
aVSo, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
p30
aVAnd my dad said, "Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church,
p31
aVthat God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong,
p32
aVbut when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
p33
aVSo, you've grown up and reached the age of reason,
p34
aVand now God will start keeping notes on you,
p35
aVand begin your permanent record."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd I said, "Oh ...
p40
aVWait a minute.
p41
aVYou mean all that time, up till today,
p42
aVall that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
p43
aVAnd my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
p48
aVHow could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
p49
aVAll that being good and no real credit for it.
p50
aVAnd worst of all, how could I not have realized
p51
aVthis very important information
p52
aVuntil the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
p53
aVSo I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
p54
aVI mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
p55
aVAnd my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,
p56
aVI think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
p57
aVAnd my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.
p58
aVJulie, there is no Santa Claus."
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
p63
aVMy parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:
p64
aVhow they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed
p65
aVthat instead of Santa delivering our presents
p66
aVover the night of Christmas Eve,
p67
aVlike he did for every other family who got to open their surprises
p68
aVfirst thing Christmas morning,
p69
aVour family would give Santa more time.
p70
aVSanta would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass
p71
aVon Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
p72
aVWhich made me very suspicious.
p73
aVIt was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
p74
aVI mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,
p75
aVand my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VPlus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back
p80
aVto our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
p81
aVThere was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:
p82
aVour family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit,
p83
aVand my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,
p84
aVthis humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly \u2014
p85
aVbut let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
p86
aVSo to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all
p87
aVwas actually sort of a relief.
p88
aa(lp89
VI left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,
p90
aVbut rather, I was just dumbfounded
p91
aVabout how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
p92
aVIt was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,
p93
aVsomeone who could use the information.
p94
aVThey had to fit two criteria:
p95
aVthey had to be old enough to be able to understand
p96
aVthe whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
p97
aVThe answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
p98
aVWell, I finally found Bill
p99
aVabout a block away from our house at this public school playground.
p100
aVIt was a Saturday, and he was all by himself,
p101
aVjust kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
p102
aVI ran up to him and said, "Bill!
p103
aVI just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,
p104
aVand then you're capable of committing any and all sins
p105
aVagainst God and man."
p106
aVAnd Bill said, "So?"
p107
aVAnd I said, "So, you're six.
p108
aVYou have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it."
p109
aVAnd he said, "So?"
p110
aVAnd I said, "So? So everything!"
p111
aVAnd I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
p112
aVBut when I got to the top of the steps,
p113
aVI turned around dramatically and said,
p114
aV"Oh, by the way, Bill \u2014 there is no Santa Claus."
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, I didn't know it at the time,
p119
aVbut I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.
p120
aVFor my 13th birthday,
p121
aVI planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,
p122
aVbut a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,
p123
aV"I need to speak to you privately.
p124
aVSeptember 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th."
p125
aVAnd I said, "What?"
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd she said ...
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th."
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
V"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th,
p138
aVand then I wasn't sure
p139
aVthat you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,
p140
aVso I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th.
p141
aVBut, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
p142
aVI thought about it, and when I was four,
p143
aVI was already the oldest of four children,
p144
aVand my mother even had another child to come,
p145
aVso what I think she \u2014 understandably \u2014 really meant
p146
aVwas that she was so ready, she was so ready.
p147
aVThen she said, "Don't worry, Julie.
p148
aVEvery year on October 10th,
p149
aVwhen it was your birthday but you didn't realize it,
p150
aVI made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VWhich was comforting, but troubling.
p155
aVMy mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VWhat was so upsetting about this new piece of information
p160
aVwas not that I had to change the date of my slumber party
p161
aVwith all of my girlfriends.
p162
aVWhat was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo.
p163
aVI had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.
p164
aVAnd I read my horoscope every single day,
p165
aVand it was so totally me.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd this meant that I was a Libra?
p170
aVSo, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
p171
aVThe Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,
p172
aVsort of lounging by some water,
p173
aVbut the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
p174
aVThis was around the time that I started filling out physically,
p175
aVand I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,
p176
aVand frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale
p177
aVjust seemed ominous and depressing.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VBut I got the new Libra poster,
p182
aVand I started to read my new Libra horoscope,
p183
aVand I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VIt wasn't until years later, looking back
p188
aVon this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing,
p189
aVthat it dawned on me:
p190
aVI wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven.
p191
aVI had a whole other month
p192
aVto do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
p193
aVOh, life can be so cruel.
p194
aVOne day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
p195
aVNow, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,
p196
aVand my block is \u2014 well, it's a natural beginning
p197
aVfor people who are peddling things door to door.
p198
aVSometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church
p199
aVshowing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
p200
aVAnd sometimes I get teenagers who promise me
p201
aVthat they won't join a gang and just start robbing people,
p202
aVif I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
p203
aVSo normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered.
p204
aVAnd there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,
p205
aVand they had little name tags
p206
aVthat identified them as official representatives
p207
aVof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
p208
aVand they said they had a message for me, from God.
p209
aVI said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
p210
aVNow, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,
p211
aVaround a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,
p212
aVI've worked with them and even dated them,
p213
aVbut I never really knew the doctrine,
p214
aVor what they said to people when they were out on a mission,
p215
aVand I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in."
p216
aVAnd they looked really happy,
p217
aVbecause I don't think this happens to them all that often.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water \u2014
p222
aVOk, I got it, I got it.
p223
aVI got them glasses of water.
p224
aVDon't touch my hair, that's the thing.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VYou can't put a video of myself in front of me
p229
aVand expect me not to fix my hair.
p230
aVOk.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,
p235
aVand after niceties, they said,
p236
aV"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
p237
aVAnd I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,
p238
aVbut you know, I don't like that word 'heart,'
p239
aVbecause it anthropomorphizes God,
p240
aVand I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
p241
aVBut I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,
p242
aVso after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said,
p243
aV"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
p244
aVAnd they looked at each other and smiled,
p245
aVlike that was the right answer.
p246
aVAnd then they said, "Do you believe
p247
aVthat we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
p248
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I do."
p249
aVAnd I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
p250
aVAnd they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,
p253
aVwho lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
p254
aVNow, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil.
p255
aVEvery single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
p256
aVAnd God came to Lehi and said to him,
p257
aV"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here."
p258
aVAnd God did lead them.
p259
aVHe led them to America.
p260
aVI said, "America?
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VFrom Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
p265
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThen they told me how Lehi and his descendants
p270
aVreproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years,
p271
aVthere were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,
p272
aVand the Nephites were totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014
p273
aVand the Lamanites were totally bad and evil \u2014
p274
aVevery single one of them just bad to the bone.
p275
aa(lp276
VThen, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,
p277
aVon his way up to heaven,
p278
aVhe stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good \u2014
p283
aVeach and every one of them \u2014
p284
aVthey would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
p285
aVBut apparently somebody blew it,
p286
aVbecause the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
p287
aVAll but one guy, this guy named Mormon,
p288
aVwho managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
p289
aVAnd he made sure this whole story was written down
p290
aVin reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,
p291
aVwhich he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VWell, I was just on the edge of my seat.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VI said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
p300
aVAnd they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S."
p301
aVAnd I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended
p302
aVfrom a people who were totally evil?"
p303
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p304
aVThen they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith
p305
aVfound those buried gold plates right in his backyard,
p306
aVand he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat
p307
aVand then buried his face into,
p308
aVand this allowed him to translate the gold plates
p309
aVfrom the reformed Egyptian into English.
p310
aa(lp311
VWell, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice
p312
aVabout their pitch.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VI wanted to say \u2014
p317
aa(lp318
V(Applause)
p319
aa(lp320
V"Ok, don't start with this story."
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VI mean, even the Scientologists
p325
aVknow to start with a personality test before they start \u2014
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
Vtelling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
p330
aVThen, they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us
p331
aVthrough his righteous prophets?"
p332
aVAnd I said, "No, I don't,"
p333
aVbecause I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story
p334
aVand this crazy gold plate story,
p335
aVbut the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through,
p336
aVso I backpedaled a little and I said,
p337
aV"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?
p338
aVAnd what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
p339
aVAnd they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"
p340
aVAnd they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift
p341
aVthat is so spectacular,
p342
aVit is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men
p343
aVwas the gift of prophecy."
p344
aVWhat is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
p345
aVMaybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VWomen's longer lifespan?
p350
aVThe fact that women tend to be much less violent than men?
p351
aVBut no \u2014 it wasn't any of these gifts.
p352
aVThey said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
p353
aVI said, "Oh, come on.
p354
aVI mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year
p355
aVfrom the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,
p356
aVassuming they didn't die from exhaustion,
p357
aVit still seems like some women would have some time left over
p358
aVto hear the word of God."
p359
aVAnd they said, "No."
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VWell, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,
p364
aVbut they had more to say.
p365
aVThey said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon,
p366
aVand if you're in good standing with the church,
p367
aVwhen you die, you get to go to heaven
p368
aVand be with your family for all eternity."
p369
aVAnd I said, "Oh, dear.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VThat wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd they said, "Oh.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VHey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven,
p382
aVyou get your body restored to you in its best original state.
p383
aVLike, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
p384
aVOr, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
p385
aVI said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,
p386
aVbecause I had cancer a few years ago.
p387
aVSo does this mean that if I went to heaven,
p388
aVI would get my old uterus back?"
p389
aVAnd they said, "Sure."
p390
aVAnd I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
p391
aVWhat if you had a nose job and you liked it?
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VWould God force you to get your old nose back?
p396
aVThen they gave me this Book of Mormon,
p397
aVtold me to read this chapter and that chapter,
p398
aVand said they'd come back and check in on me,
p399
aVand I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry,"
p400
aVor maybe just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
p401
aa(lp402
VOk, so I initially felt really superior to these boys,
p403
aVand smug in my more conventional faith.
p404
aVBut then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
p405
aVIf someone came to my door
p406
aVand I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time,
p407
aVand they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl
p408
aVwithout the use of intercourse,
p409
aVand the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us."
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
V"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,"
p414
aVI mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
p415
aVI'm just so used to that story.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VSo, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
p420
aVBut the question they asked me when they first arrived
p421
aVreally stuck in my head:
p422
aVDid I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
p423
aVBecause I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
p424
aVNow, if they had asked me,
p425
aV"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?"
p426
aVWell, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,
p427
aV"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.
p428
aVI feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused,
p429
aVand I feel consoled and cared for.
p430
aVI take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits,
p431
aVand I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
p432
aVBut since they asked me that question with the word "believe" in it,
p433
aVsomehow it was all different,
p434
aVbecause I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
