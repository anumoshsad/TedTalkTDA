VI'm not at all a cook.
p4
aVSo don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.
p5
aVBut I do want to talk to you about something
p6
aVthat I think is dear to all of us.
p7
aVAnd that is bread \u2014 something which is as simple
p8
aVas our basic, most fundamental human staple.
p9
aVAnd I think few of us spend the day
p10
aVwithout eating bread in some form.
p11
aVUnless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,
p12
aVbread is standard.
p13
aVBread is not only standard in the Western diet.
p14
aVAs I will show to you, it is actually
p15
aVthe mainstay of modern life.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I'm going to bake bread for you.
p18
aVIn the meantime I'm also talking to you,
p19
aVso my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.
p20
aVFirst of all, a little bit of audience participation.
p21
aVI have two loaves of bread here.
p22
aVOne is a supermarket standard:
p23
aVwhite bread, pre-packaged,
p24
aVwhich I'm told is called a Wonderbread.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVI didn't know this word until I arrived.
p27
aVAnd this is more or less,
p28
aVa whole-meal, handmade,
p29
aVsmall-bakery loaf of bread.
p30
aVHere we go. I want to see a show of hands.
p31
aVWho prefers the whole-meal bread?
p32
aVOkay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVI have two tentative male hands.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VOkay, now the question is really,
p38
aVwhy is this so?
p39
aVAnd I think it is because
p40
aVwe feel that this kind of bread
p41
aVreally is about authenticity.
p42
aVIt's about a traditional way of living.
p43
aVA way that is perhaps more real, more honest.
p44
aVThis is an image from Tuscany, where we feel
p45
aVagriculture is still about beauty.
p46
aVAnd life is really, too.
p47
aVAnd this is about good taste, good traditions.
p48
aVWhy do we have this image?
p49
aVWhy do we feel that this is more true than this?
p50
aVWell I think it has a lot to do with our history.
p51
aVIn the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,
p52
aVmost of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists
p53
aVor they were closely related to food production.
p54
aVAnd we have this mythical image
p55
aVof how life was in rural areas in the past.
p56
aVArt has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
p57
aVIt was a mythical past.
p58
aVOf course, the reality is quite different.
p59
aVThese poor farmers
p60
aVworking the land by hand or with their animals,
p61
aVhad yield levels that are comparable
p62
aVto the poorest farmers today in West Africa.
p63
aVBut we have, somehow,
p64
aVin the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,
p65
aVstarted to cultivate an image of
p66
aVa mythical, rural agricultural past.
p67
aa(lp68
VIt was only 200 years ago
p69
aVthat we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
p70
aVAnd while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,
p71
aVit's very important to understand
p72
aVwhat that revolution did to us.
p73
aVIt brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
p74
aVAnd it actually drove up our yields.
p75
aVAnd even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,
p76
aVcan now be done automatically.
p77
aVAll that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.
p78
aVOf course we also, particularly in the last decade,
p79
aVmanaged to envelop the world
p80
aVin a dense chain of supermarkets,
p81
aVin a chain of global trade.
p82
aVAnd it means that you now eat products,
p83
aVwhich can come from all around the world.
p84
aVThat is the reality of our modern life.
p85
aVNow you may prefer this loaf of bread.
p86
aVExcuse my hands but this is how it is.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut actually the real relevant bread,
p89
aVhistorically, is this white Wonder loaf.
p90
aVAnd don't despise the white bread
p91
aVbecause it really, I think,
p92
aVsymbolizes the fact that bread and food
p93
aVhave become plentiful and affordable to all.
p94
aVAnd that is a feat that we
p95
aVare not really conscious of that much.
p96
aVBut it has changed the world.
p97
aVThis tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways
p98
aVand has a lot of problems
p99
aVhas changed the world.
p100
aVSo what is happening?
p101
aVWell the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.
p102
aVWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution
p103
aVwith modernization of agriculture
p104
aVin the last few decades, since the 1960s,
p105
aVfood availability, per head, in this world,
p106
aVhas increased by 25 percent.
p107
aVAnd the world population in the meantime has doubled.
p108
aVThat means that we have now more food available
p109
aVthan ever before in human history.
p110
aVAnd that is the result, directly,
p111
aVof being so successful
p112
aVat increasing the scale and volume of our production.
p113
aVAnd this is true, as you can see, for all countries,
p114
aVincluding the so-called developing countries.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhat happened to our bread in the meantime?
p117
aVAs food became plentiful here,
p118
aVit also meant that we were able to decrease
p119
aVthe number of people working in agriculture
p120
aVto something like, on average, in the high income countries,
p121
aVfive percent or less of the population.
p122
aVIn the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.
p123
aVAnd it frees us all up to do other things \u2014
p124
aVto sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.
p125
aVThat is, historically, a really unique situation.
p126
aVNever before has the responsibility to feed the world
p127
aVbeen in the hands of so few people.
p128
aVAnd never before have so many people
p129
aVbeen oblivious of that fact.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
p132
aVAnd as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
p133
aVWe added in more sugar.
p134
aVWe add in raisins and oil and milk
p135
aVand all kinds of things to make bread,
p136
aVfrom a simple food into kind of a support for calories.
p137
aVAnd today, bread now is associated with obesity,
p138
aVwhich is very strange.
p139
aVIt is the basic, most fundamental food
p140
aVthat we've had in the last ten thousand years.
p141
aVWheat is the most important crop \u2014 the first crop we domesticated
p142
aVand the most important crop we still grow today.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut this is now this strange concoction
p145
aVof high calories.
p146
aVAnd that's not only true in this country,
p147
aVit is true all over the world.
p148
aVBread has migrated to tropical countries,
p149
aVwhere the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers
p150
aVand where the commuters
p151
aVfind bread much more handy to use
p152
aVthan rice or cassava.
p153
aVSo bread has become from a main staple,
p154
aVa source of calories
p155
aVassociated with obesity
p156
aVand also a source of modernity,
p157
aVof modern life.
p158
aVAnd the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo this is the story of bread as we know it now.
p161
aVBut of course the price of mass production
p162
aVhas been that we moved large-scale.
p163
aVAnd large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,
p164
aVdestruction of biodiversity \u2014
p165
aVstill a lonely emu here
p166
aVin the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.
p167
aVThe costs have been tremendous \u2014
p168
aVwater pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.
p169
aa(lp170
VWhat we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.
p171
aVAnd this is where I have to query all of you.
p172
aVHow many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?
p173
aVHow many of you actually can make a bread
p174
aVin this way, without starting with a bread machine
p175
aVor just some kind of packaged flavor?
p176
aVCan you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?
p177
aVWe have become very removed
p178
aVfrom what our bread really is,
p179
aVwhich, again, evolutionarily speaking,
p180
aVis very strange.
p181
aVIn fact not many of you know that
p182
aVour bread, of course, was not a European invention.
p183
aVIt was invented by farmers in Iraq
p184
aVand Syria in particular.
p185
aVThe tiny spike on the left to the center
p186
aVis actually the forefather of wheat.
p187
aVThis is where it all comes from,
p188
aVand where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,
p189
aVput us on the road of bread.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow it is not surprising
p192
aVthat with this massification and large-scale production,
p193
aVthere is a counter-movement that emerged \u2014
p194
aVvery much also here in California.
p195
aVThe counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.
p196
aVLet's go back to traditional farming.
p197
aVLet's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,
p198
aVsmall bakeries and all that." Wonderful.
p199
aVDon't we all agree? I certainly agree.
p200
aVI would love to go back to Tuscany
p201
aVto this kind of traditional setting,
p202
aVgastronomy, good food.
p203
aVBut this is a fallacy.
p204
aVAnd the fallacy comes from idealizing
p205
aVa past that we have forgotten about.
p206
aa(lp207
VIf we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming
p208
aVwe are going, actually, to relegate
p209
aVthese poor farmers and their husbands \u2014
p210
aVamong whom I have lived for many years,
p211
aVworking without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production \u2014
p212
aVwe relegate them to poverty.
p213
aVWhat they want are implements
p214
aVto increase their production:
p215
aVsomething to fertilize the soil,
p216
aVsomething to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.
p217
aVWe cannot just think that small-scale
p218
aVis the solution to the world food problem.
p219
aVIt's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,
p220
aVif you want to afford it.
p221
aVIn fact we do not want this poor woman
p222
aVto work the land like this.
p223
aVIf we say just small-scale production,
p224
aVas is the tendency here,
p225
aVto go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling
p226
aVcannot even eat oranges anymore
p227
aVbecause in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.
p228
aVSo local food production is out.
p229
aVBut also we do not want
p230
aVto relegate to poverty in the rural areas.
p231
aVAnd we do not want to relegate
p232
aVthe urban poor to starvation.
p233
aVSo we must find other solutions.
p234
aa(lp235
VOne of our problems is that world food production
p236
aVneeds to increase very rapidly \u2014
p237
aVdoubling by about 2030.
p238
aVThe main driver of that is actually meat.
p239
aVAnd meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular
p240
aVis what drives the prices of cereals.
p241
aVThat need for animal protein is going to continue.
p242
aVWe can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,
p243
aVbut this is our driving force.
p244
aVSo what can we do?
p245
aVCan we find a solution to produce more?
p246
aVYes. But we need mechanization.
p247
aVAnd I'm making a real plea here.
p248
aVI feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer
p249
aVto work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,
p250
aV150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.
p251
aVYou cannot ask people to work under these conditions.
p252
aVWe need clever low-key mechanization
p253
aVthat avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo what can we do?
p256
aVWe must feed three billion people in cities.
p257
aVWe will not do that through small farmers' markets
p258
aVbecause these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.
p259
aVThey have low incomes. And they benefit
p260
aVfrom cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.
p261
aVThat's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut yes there are some solutions.
p264
aVAnd let me just do one simple conceptual thing:
p265
aVif I plot science as a proxy
p266
aVfor control of the production process and scale.
p267
aVWhat you see is that we've started
p268
aVin the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,
p269
aVwhich was sort of small-scale and low-control.
p270
aVWe've moved towards large-scale and very high control.
p271
aVWhat I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there
p272
aVbut go to a kind of regional scale \u2014
p273
aVnot just in terms of the scale of the fields,
p274
aVbut in terms of the entire food network.
p275
aVThat's where we should move.
p276
aVAnd the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,
p277
aVthat we have entirely closed ecosystems \u2014
p278
aVthe horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.
p279
aVSo we need to think differently about agriculture science.
p280
aVAgriculture science for most people \u2014 and there are not many farmers
p281
aVamong you here \u2014
p282
aVhas this name of being bad,
p283
aVof being about pollution, about large-scale,
p284
aVabout the destruction of the environment.
p285
aVThat is not necessary.
p286
aVWe need more science and not less. And we need good science.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo what kind of science can we have?
p289
aVWell first of all I think
p290
aVwe can do much better on the existing technologies.
p291
aVUse biotechnology where useful,
p292
aVparticularly in pest and disease resistance.
p293
aVThere are also robots, for example,
p294
aVwho can recognize weeds
p295
aVwith a resolution of half an inch.
p296
aVWe have much cleverer irrigation.
p297
aVWe do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
p298
aVAnd we need to think very dispassionately
p299
aVabout the comparative advantages
p300
aVof small-scale and large-scale.
p301
aVWe need to think that land is multi-functional.
p302
aVIt has different functions.
p303
aVThere are different ways in which we must use it \u2014
p304
aVfor residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
p305
aVAnd we also need to re-examine livestock.
p306
aVGo regional and go to urban food systems.
p307
aVI want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.
p308
aVI want to have horticulture
p309
aVand greenhouses on top of residential areas.
p310
aVAnd I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses
p311
aVand from the fermentation of crops
p312
aVto heat our residential areas.
p313
aVThere are all kinds of ways we can do it.
p314
aVWe cannot solve the world food problem
p315
aVby using biological agriculture.
p316
aVBut we can do a lot more.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd the main thing that I would really ask all of you
p319
aVas you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:
p320
aVask your government for an integrated food policy.
p321
aVFood is as important as energy,
p322
aVas security, as the environment.
p323
aVEverything is linked together.
p324
aVSo we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country
p325
aVlike the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,
p326
aVwe have combined these functions.
p327
aVSo this is not science fiction. We can combine things
p328
aVeven in a social sense of making
p329
aVthe rural areas more accessible to people \u2014
p330
aVto house, for example, the chronically sick.
p331
aVThere is all kinds of things we can do.
p332
aa(lp333
VBut there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,
p334
aV"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."
p335
aVYou must go back
p336
aVand think about your own food chain.
p337
aVTalk to farmers. When was the last time
p338
aVyou went to a farm and talked to a farmer?
p339
aVTalk to people in restaurants.
p340
aVUnderstand where you are in the food chain,
p341
aVwhere your food comes from.
p342
aVUnderstand that you are part
p343
aVof this enormous chain of events.
p344
aVAnd that frees you up to do other things.
p345
aVAnd above all, to me, food is about respect.
p346
aVIt's about understanding, when you eat,
p347
aVthat there are also many people who are still in this situation,
p348
aVwho are still struggling for their daily food.
p349
aVAnd the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,
p350
aVto think that doing everything by hand
p351
aVis going to be the solution,
p352
aVis really not morally justified.
p353
aVWe need to help to lift them out of poverty.
p354
aVWe need to make them proud of being a farmer
p355
aVbecause they allow us to survive.
p356
aVNever before, as I said,
p357
aVhas the responsibility for food
p358
aVbeen in the hands of so few.
p359
aVAnd never before have we had the luxury
p360
aVof taking it for granted
p361
aVbecause it is now so cheap.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd I think there is nobody else who has expressed
p364
aVbetter, to me, the idea that food, in the end,
p365
aVin our own tradition, is something holy.
p366
aVIt's not about nutrients and calories.
p367
aVIt's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.
p368
aVWho said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,
p369
aV75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.
p370
aVHe did not speak about rice, in India. He said,
p371
aV"To those who have to go without two meals a day,
p372
aVGod can only appear as bread."
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd so as I'm finishing my bread here \u2014
p375
aVand I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.
p376
aVLet me share
p377
aVwith those of you here in the first row.
p378
aVLet me share some of the food with you.
p379
aVTake some of my bread.
p380
aVAnd as you eat it, and as you try it \u2014
p381
aVplease come and stand up.
p382
aVHave some of it.
p383
aVI want you to think that every bite connects you
p384
aVto the past and the future:
p385
aVto these anonymous farmers,
p386
aVthat first bred the first wheat varieties;
p387
aVand to the farmers of today,
p388
aVwho've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.
p389
aVEvery meal you eat
p390
aVcontains ingredients from all across the world.
p391
aVEverything makes us so privileged,
p392
aVthat we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.
p393
aVAnd that, I think,
p394
aVevolutionarily-speaking is unique.
p395
aVWe've never had that before.
p396
aVSo enjoy your bread.
p397
aVEat it, and feel privileged.
p398
aVThank you very much.
