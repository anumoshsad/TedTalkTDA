VWith all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu \u2014
p4
aVand we'll hear about that from the
p5
aVbrilliant Dr. Brilliant later today \u2014
p6
aVI want to talk about the other pandemic, which is
p7
aVcardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension \u2014
p8
aVall of which are completely preventable for at
p9
aVleast 95 percent of people
p10
aVjust by changing diet and lifestyle.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd what's happening is that there's a
p13
aVglobalization of illness occurring, that people
p14
aVare starting to eat like us, and live like us, and
p15
aVdie like us. And in one generation, for example,
p16
aVAsia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of
p17
aVheart disease and obesity and diabetes to one
p18
aVof the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease
p19
aVequals the HIV and AIDS deaths
p20
aVin most countries.
p21
aVSo there's a critical window of opportunity we
p22
aVhave to make an important difference that can
p23
aVaffect the lives of literally millions of people,
p24
aVand practice preventive medicine on a global
p25
aVscale.
p26
aa(lp27
VHeart and blood vessel diseases still kill more
p28
aVpeople \u2014 not only in this country, but also
p29
aVworldwide \u2014 than everything else combined, and yet
p30
aVit's completely preventable for almost everybody.
p31
aVIt's not only preventable; it's actually
p32
aVreversible. And for the last almost 29 years,
p33
aVwe've been able to show that by simply changing
p34
aVdiet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech,
p35
aVexpensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how
p36
aVpowerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost
p37
aVinterventions can be like \u2014 quantitative
p38
aVarteriography, before and after a year, and
p39
aVcardiac PET scans.
p40
aa(lp41
VWe showed a few months ago \u2014 we published the
p42
aVfirst study showing you can actually stop or
p43
aVreverse the progression of prostate cancer by
p44
aVmaking changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent
p45
aVregression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of
p46
aVthe tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the
p47
aVcontrol group.
p48
aVAnd in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the
p49
aVprostate tumor activity is shown in red \u2014 you can
p50
aVsee it diminishing after a year.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of
p53
aVadults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning
p54
aVto me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the
p55
aVpast 10 years, and this may be the first
p56
aVgeneration in which our kids live a shorter life
p57
aVspan than we do. That's pitiful, and it's
p58
aVpreventable.
p59
aVNow these are not election returns, these are the
p60
aVpeople \u2014 the number of the people who are obese
p61
aVby state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 \u2014 these are
p62
aVfrom the CDC website \u2014 '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014 you
p63
aVget a new category \u2014 '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,
p64
aV'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 \u2014 it gets worse. We're
p65
aVkind of devolving. (Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VNow what can we do about this? Well, you know, the
p68
aVdiet that we've found that can reverse heart
p69
aVdisease and cancer is an Asian diet.
p70
aVBut the people in Asia are starting to eat like we
p71
aVare, which is why they're starting to get sick
p72
aVlike we are.
p73
aVSo I've been working with a lot of the big food
p74
aVcompanies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip
p75
aVand crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods,
p76
aVlike \u2014 I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's,
p77
aVand PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon
p78
aVDel Monte, and they're finding that it's good
p79
aVbusiness.
p80
aVThe salads that you see at McDonald's came from
p81
aVthe work \u2014 they're going to have an Asian salad. At
p82
aVPepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came
p83
aVfrom their better foods.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd so if we can do that, then we can free up
p86
aVresources for buying drugs that you really do need
p87
aVfor treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for
p88
aVpreventing avian flu. Thank you.
