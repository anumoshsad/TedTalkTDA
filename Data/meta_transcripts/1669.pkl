VSo, why does good sex so often fade,
p4
aVeven for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?
p5
aVAnd why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex,
p6
aVcontrary to popular belief?
p7
aVOr, the next question would be,
p8
aVcan we want what we already have?
p9
aVThat's the million-dollar question, right?
p10
aVAnd why is the forbidden so erotic?
p11
aVWhat is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?
p12
aVAnd why does sex make babies,
p13
aVand babies spell erotic disaster in couples?
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIt's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?
p18
aVAnd when you love, how does it feel?
p19
aVAnd when you desire, how is it different?
p20
aa(lp21
VThese are some of the questions
p22
aVthat are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire
p23
aVand its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.
p24
aVSo I travel the globe,
p25
aVand what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered,
p26
aVthere seems to be a crisis of desire.
p27
aVA crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting \u2014
p28
aVdesire as an expression of our individuality,
p29
aVof our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity \u2014
p30
aVdesire that has become a central concept
p31
aVas part of modern love and individualistic societies.
p32
aa(lp33
VYou know, this is the first time in the history of humankind
p34
aVwhere we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term
p35
aVnot because we want 14 children,
p36
aVfor which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it,
p37
aVand not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.
p38
aVThis is the first time that we want sex over time
p39
aVabout pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?
p42
aVAnd at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship,
p43
aVI think, is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
p44
aVOn the one hand, our need for security, for predictability,
p45
aVfor safety, for dependability,
p46
aVfor reliability, for permanence.
p47
aVAll these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives
p48
aVthat we call home.
p49
aVBut we also have an equally strong need \u2014 men and women \u2014
p50
aVfor adventure, for novelty,
p51
aVfor mystery, for risk, for danger,
p52
aVfor the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise \u2014
p53
aVyou get the gist.
p54
aVFor journey, for travel.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure
p57
aVinto one relationship,
p58
aVor what we today like to call a passionate marriage,
p59
aVused to be a contradiction in terms.
p60
aVMarriage was an economic institution
p61
aVin which you were given a partnership for life
p62
aVin terms of children and social status
p63
aVand succession and companionship.
p64
aVBut now we want our partner to still give us all these things,
p65
aVbut in addition I want you to be my best friend
p66
aVand my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot,
p67
aVand we live twice as long.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo we come to one person, and we basically are asking them
p72
aVto give us what once an entire village used to provide.
p73
aVGive me belonging, give me identity,
p74
aVgive me continuity,
p75
aVbut give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.
p76
aVGive me comfort, give me edge.
p77
aVGive me novelty, give me familiarity.
p78
aVGive me predictability, give me surprise.
p79
aVAnd we think it's a given,
p80
aVand toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VSo now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?
p87
aVBecause I think, in some way \u2014
p88
aVand I'll come back to that \u2014
p89
aVbut the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo why does good sex so often fade?
p92
aVWhat is the relationship between love and desire?
p93
aVHow do they relate, and how do they conflict?
p94
aVBecause therein lies the mystery of eroticism.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."
p97
aVAnd if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."
p98
aVIn love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.
p99
aVWe want to minimize the distance.
p100
aVWe want to contract that gap.
p101
aVWe want to neutralize the tensions.
p102
aVWe want closeness.
p103
aVBut in desire,
p104
aVwe tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.
p105
aVForgone conclusion does not keep our interest.
p106
aVIn desire, we want an Other,
p107
aVsomebody on the other side that we can go visit,
p108
aVthat we can go spend some time with,
p109
aVthat we can go see what goes on in their red-light district.
p110
aVYou know?
p111
aVIn desire, we want a bridge to cross.
p112
aVOr in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.
p113
aVDesire needs space.
p114
aVAnd when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut then I took a question with me.
p117
aVAnd I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years
p118
aVwith "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people,
p119
aVwhen do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?
p120
aVNot attracted sexually, per Se, but most drawn.
p121
aVAnd across culture, across religion, and across gender \u2014 except for one \u2014
p122
aVthere are a few answers that just keep coming back.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo the first group is:
p125
aVI am most drawn to my partner when she is away,
p126
aVwhen we are apart, when we reunite.
p127
aVBasically, when I get back in touch
p128
aVwith my ability to imagine myself with my partner,
p129
aVwhen my imagination comes back in the picture,
p130
aVand when I can root it in absence and in longing,
p131
aVwhich is a major component of desire.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut then the second group is even more interesting.
p134
aVI am most drawn to my partner
p135
aVwhen I see him in the studio,
p136
aVwhen she is onstage,
p137
aVwhen he is in his element,
p138
aVwhen she's doing something she's passionate about,
p139
aVwhen I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him,
p140
aVwhen I see her hold court.
p141
aVBasically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident.
p142
aVProbably the biggest turn-on across the board.
p143
aVRadiant, as in self-sustaining.
p144
aVI look at this person \u2014 by the way, in desire
p145
aVpeople rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one,
p146
aVfive centimeters from each other.
p147
aVI don't know in inches how much that is.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut it's also not when the other person is that far apart
p150
aVthat you no longer see them.
p151
aVIt's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance,
p152
aVwhere this person that is already so familiar, so known,
p153
aVis momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
p154
aVAnd in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan,
p155
aVlies that movement toward the other.
p156
aVBecause sometimes, as Proust says,
p157
aVmystery is not about traveling to new places,
p158
aVbut it's about looking with new eyes.
p159
aVAnd so, when I see my partner on his own or her own,
p160
aVdoing something in which they are enveloped,
p161
aVI look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception,
p162
aVand I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd then, more importantly, in this description about the other
p165
aVor myself \u2014 it's the same \u2014
p166
aVwhat is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.
p167
aVNobody needs anybody.
p168
aVThere is no caretaking in desire.
p169
aVCaretaking is mightily loving.
p170
aVIt's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VI have yet to see somebody who is so turned on
p175
aVby somebody who needs them.
p176
aVWanting them is one thing.
p177
aVNeeding them is a shot down
p178
aVand women have known that forever,
p179
aVbecause anything that will bring up parenthood
p180
aVwill usually decrease the erotic charge.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VFor good reasons, right?
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd then the third group of answers usually would be:
p187
aVwhen I'm surprised, when we laugh together,
p188
aVas somebody said to me in the office today,
p189
aVwhen he's in his tux, so I said, you know,
p190
aVit's either the tux or the cowboy boots.
p191
aVBut basically it's when there is novelty.
p192
aVBut novelty isn't about new positions.
p193
aVIt isn't a repertoire of techniques.
p194
aVNovelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?
p195
aVWhat parts of you are just being seen?
p196
aa(lp197
VBecause in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?
p198
aVSex is a place you go.
p199
aVIt's a space you enter
p200
aVinside yourself and with another, or others.
p201
aVSo where do you go in sex?
p202
aVWhat parts of you do you connect to?
p203
aVWhat do you seek to express there?
p204
aVIs it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?
p205
aVIs it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
p206
aVIs it a place where you can finally surrender
p207
aVand not have to take responsibility for everything?
p208
aVIs it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?
p209
aVWhat comes out there? It's a language.
p210
aVIt isn't just a behavior.
p211
aVAnd it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in,
p212
aVwhich is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.
p213
aa(lp214
VYou know, animals have sex.
p215
aVIt's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.
p216
aVWe are the only ones who have an erotic life,
p217
aVwhich means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.
p218
aVWe are the only ones who can make love for hours,
p219
aVhave a blissful time, multiple orgasms,
p220
aVand touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.
p221
aVWe can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.
p222
aVWe can experience that powerful thing called anticipation,
p223
aVwhich is a mortar to desire.
p224
aVThe ability to imagine it, as if it's happening,
p225
aVto experience it as if it's happening,
p226
aVwhile nothing is happening
p227
aVand everything is happening, at the same time.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo when I began to think about eroticism,
p230
aVI began to think about the poetics of sex.
p231
aVAnd if I look at it as an intelligence,
p232
aVthen it's something that you cultivate.
p233
aVWhat are the ingredients?
p234
aVImagination, playfulness,
p235
aVnovelty, curiosity, mystery.
p236
aVBut the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut more importantly, for me to begin to understand
p239
aVwho are the couples who have an erotic spark,
p240
aVwhat sustains desire,
p241
aVI had to go back to the original definition of eroticism,
p242
aVthe mystical definition,
p243
aVand I went through it through a bifurcation
p244
aVby looking, actually, at trauma,
p245
aVwhich is the other side.
p246
aVAnd I looked at it,
p247
aVlooking at the community that I had grown up in,
p248
aVwhich was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors,
p249
aVand in my community, there were two groups:
p250
aVthose who didn't die, and those who came back to life.
p251
aVAnd those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground,
p252
aVcould not experience pleasure, could not trust,
p253
aVbecause when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure,
p254
aVyou can't lift your head to go and take off in space
p255
aVand be playful and safe and imaginative.
p256
aVThose who came back to life
p257
aVwere those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.
p258
aVThey knew how to keep themselves alive.
p259
aVAnd when I began to listen
p260
aVto the sexlessness of the couples that I work with,
p261
aVI sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex,"
p262
aVbut generally, people want better sex,
p263
aVand better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness,
p264
aVof vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,
p265
aVof Eros, of energy
p266
aVthat sex used to afford them,
p267
aVor that they've hoped it would afford them.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd so I began to ask a different question.
p270
aV"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.
p271
aV"I turn off my desires when ..."
p272
aVWhich is not the same question as,
p273
aV"What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."
p274
aVAnd people began to say, "I turn myself off when
p275
aVI feel dead inside, when I don't like my body,
p276
aVwhen I feel old,
p277
aVwhen I haven't had time for myself,
p278
aVwhen I haven't had a chance to even check in with you,
p279
aVwhen I don't perform well at work,
p280
aVwhen I feel low self esteem,
p281
aVwhen I don't have a sense of self-worth,
p282
aVwhen I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take,
p283
aVto receive pleasure."
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd then I began to ask the reverse question.
p286
aV"I turn myself on when ..."
p287
aVBecause most of the time, people like to ask the question,
p288
aV"You turn me on, what turns me on,"
p289
aVand I'm out of the question, you know?
p290
aVNow, if you are dead inside,
p291
aVthe other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.
p292
aVIt won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VSo I turn myself on when,
p297
aVI turn on my desires, I wake up when ...
p298
aa(lp299
VNow, in this paradox between love and desire,
p300
aVwhat seems to be so puzzling
p301
aVis that the very ingredients that nurture love \u2014
p302
aVmutuality, reciprocity,
p303
aVprotection, worry, responsibility for the other \u2014
p304
aVare sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.
p305
aVBecause desire comes with a host of feelings
p306
aVthat are not always such favorites of love:
p307
aVjealousy, possessiveness,
p308
aVaggression, power, dominance,
p309
aVnaughtiness, mischief.
p310
aVBasically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things
p311
aVthat we will demonstrate against during the day.
p312
aVYou know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.
p313
aVIf everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses,
p314
aVwe wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VBut no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on
p319
aVthat we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love,
p320
aVbecause we think love comes with selflessness
p321
aVand in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness
p322
aVin the best sense of the word:
p323
aVthe ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo I want to draw that little image for you,
p326
aVbecause this need to reconcile these two sets of needs,
p327
aVwe are born with that.
p328
aVOur need for connection, our need for separateness,
p329
aVor our need for security and adventure,
p330
aVor our need for togetherness and for autonomy,
p331
aVand if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap
p332
aVand who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable,
p333
aVand at some point all of us need to go out into the world
p334
aVto discover and to explore.
p335
aVThat's the beginning of desire,
p336
aVthat exploratory need, curiosity, discovery.
p337
aVAnd then at some point they turn around and they look at you.
p338
aVAnd if you tell them,
p339
aV"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.
p340
aVGo for it. There's so much fun out there,"
p341
aVthen they can turn away and they can experience
p342
aVconnection and separateness at the same time.
p343
aVThey can go off in their imagination, off in their body,
p344
aVoff in their playfulness,
p345
aVall the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut if on this side there is somebody who says,
p348
aV"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.
p349
aVMy partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.
p350
aVWhat's so good out there?
p351
aVDon't we have everything you need together, you and I?"
p352
aVthen there are a few little reactions
p353
aVthat all of us can pretty much recognize.
p354
aVSome of us will come back,
p355
aVcame back a long time ago,
p356
aVand that little child who comes back
p357
aVis the child who will forgo a part of himself
p358
aVin order not to lose the other.
p359
aVI will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
p360
aVAnd I will learn to love in a certain way
p361
aVthat will become burdened with extra worry
p362
aVand extra responsibility and extra protection,
p363
aVand I won't know how to leave you
p364
aVin order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure,
p365
aVin order to discover, to enter inside myself.
p366
aa(lp367
VTranslate this into adult language.
p368
aVIt starts very young.
p369
aVIt continues into our sex lives up to the end.
p370
aVChild number two comes back
p371
aVbut looks like that over their shoulder all the time.
p372
aV"Are you going to be there?
p373
aVAre you going to curse me, scold me?
p374
aVAre you going to be angry with me?"
p375
aVAnd they may be gone, but they're never really away.
p376
aVAnd those are often the people that will tell you,
p377
aV"In the beginning, it was super hot."
p378
aVBecause in the beginning,
p379
aVthe growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong
p380
aVthat it actually led to the decrease of desire.
p381
aVThe more connected I became, the more responsible I felt,
p382
aVthe less I was able to let go in your presence.
p383
aVThe third child doesn't really come back.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo what happens, if you want to sustain desire,
p386
aVit's that real dialectic piece.
p387
aVOn the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.
p388
aVOn the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure,
p389
aVyou can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm,
p390
aVyou don't get excited because you spend your time
p391
aVin the body and the head of the other and not in your own.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs,
p394
aVthere are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.
p395
aVOne, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
p396
aVThey understand that there is an erotic space
p397
aVthat belongs to each of them.
p398
aVThey also understand that foreplay is not something you do
p399
aVfive minutes before the real thing.
p400
aVForeplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.
p401
aVThey also understand that an erotic space isn't about,
p402
aVyou begin to stroke the other.
p403
aVIt's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.,
p404
aVmaybe where you leave the Agile program \u2014
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen
p409
aVwho is taking care of things and being responsible.
p410
aa(lp411
VResponsibility and desire just butt heads.
p412
aVThey don't really do well together.
p413
aVErotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
p414
aVIt's pretty much like the moon.
p415
aVIt has intermittent eclipses.
p416
aVBut what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
p417
aVThey know how to bring it back.
p418
aVAnd they know how to bring it back
p419
aVbecause they have demystified one big myth,
p420
aVwhich is the myth of spontaneity,
p421
aVwhich is that it's just going to fall from heaven
p422
aVwhile you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina,
p423
aVand in fact they understood
p424
aVthat whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship, already has.
p425
aa(lp426
VCommitted sex is premeditated sex.
p427
aVIt's willful. It's intentional.
p428
aVIt's focus and presence.
p429
aa(lp430
VMerry Valentine's.
