V'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that
p4
aVrequire a certain kind of intellectual activity,
p5
aVbecause you are always comparing the variation
p6
aVwith the theme that you hold in your mind.
p7
aVYou might say that the theme is nature
p8
aVand everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
p9
aa(lp10
VI was asked, I guess about six years ago,
p11
aVto do a series of paintings
p12
aVthat in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
p13
aVAnd it was very difficult for me to imagine
p14
aVhow to paint pictures that were based on Piero
p15
aVuntil I realized that I could look at Piero as nature \u2014
p16
aVthat I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca
p17
aVas I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
p18
aVAnd that was enormously liberating to me.
p19
aVPerhaps it's not a very insightful observation,
p20
aVbut that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations
p21
aa(lp22
Vbased on a work by Piero,
p23
aVin this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"
p24
aVwho faces his consort, Battista.
p25
aVOnce I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,
p26
aVI did the following series of drawings.
p27
aVThat's the real Piero della Francesca \u2014
p28
aVone of the greatest portraits in human history.
p29
aVAnd these, I'll just show these without comment.
p30
aVIt's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,
p31
aVwho's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,
p32
aVand probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
p33
aVHe apparently lost an eye in battle,
p34
aVwhich is why he is always shown in profile.
p35
aVAnd this is Battista.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd then I decided I could move them around a little bit \u2014
p38
aVso that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
p39
aVWhoops! Passed each other.
p40
aVAnd then a visitor from another painting by Piero,
p41
aVthis is from "The Resurrection of Christ" \u2014
p42
aVas though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
p43
aVAnd now, four large panels:
p44
aVthis is upper left;
p45
aVupper right;
p46
aVlower left;
p47
aVlower right.
p48
aVIncidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.
p49
aVSince all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with
p50
aVthere doesn't seem to be an argument there.
p51
aa(lp52
VOn another subject \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter) \u2014
p55
aa(lp56
VI was driving in the country one day with my wife,
p57
aVand I saw this sign,
p58
aVand I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
p59
aVAnd she said, "What are you talking about?"
p60
aVI said, "Well, it's so persuasive,
p61
aVbecause the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,
p62
aVand since most people are so suspicious of garages,
p63
aVand know that they're going to be ripped off,
p64
aVthey use the word 'reliable.'
p65
aVBut everybody says they're reliable.
p66
aVBut, reliable Dutchman" \u2014
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter) \u2014
p69
aa(lp70
V"Fantastic!"
p71
aVBecause as soon as you hear the word Dutchman \u2014
p72
aVwhich is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore \u2014
p73
aVbut as soon as you hear Dutchman,
p74
aVyou get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,
p75
aVpreventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
p76
aVAnd so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
p77
aVNow, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,
p78
aVall you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VOr even "French."
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VI'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
p91
aVI do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,
p92
aVand the director of this school \u2014 a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes \u2014
p93
aVoften gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
p94
aVAnd so he did.
p95
aVAnd this was the text \u2014 "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/
p96
aVAlike fantastic if too new or old/
p97
aVBe not the first by whom the new are tried/
p98
aVNor yet the last to lay the old aside."
p99
aVI could make nothing of that.
p100
aVAnd I really struggled with this one.
p101
aVAnd the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,
p102
aVwas say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,
p103
aVand I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,
p104
aVand I was hoping \u2014 as one often does \u2014 to stumble into something.
p105
aVSo I took another crack at it \u2014
p106
aVyou've got to keep it moving \u2014
p107
aVand I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper
p108
aVand I pasted them down on an ugly board.
p109
aVI thought that something would come out of it,
p110
aVlike "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"
p111
aVbecause it's by Alexander Pope,
p112
aVbut I sort of made a mess out of it,
p113
aVand then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
p114
aVSo, it was going nowhere.
p115
aa(lp116
VSometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,
p117
aVI write down things that I know about it.
p118
aVBut you can see the beginning of an idea there,
p119
aVbecause you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
p120
aVThat's what happens.
p121
aVThere's a relationship between the old and the new;
p122
aVthe new emerges from the context of the old.
p123
aVAnd then I did some variations of it,
p124
aVbut it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
p125
aVI had this other version which had something interesting about it
p126
aVin terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
p127
aVThe W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,
p128
aVeven though they were very fragmentary
p129
aVand there wasn't a lot of information in it.
p130
aVThen I got the words "new" and "old"
p131
aVand now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VI was really desperate at this point.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,
p138
aVwhich is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose
p139
aVand I put them together.
p140
aVIt says "dreams" at the top.
p141
aVAnd I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
p142
aVLet it say something about dreams, and come to SVA
p143
aVand you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
p144
aVBut, to my credit,
p145
aVI was so embarrassed about doing that
p146
aVthat I never submitted this sketch.
p147
aVAnd, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
p148
aVNow, it doesn't look terribly interesting,
p149
aVbut it does have something
p150
aVthat distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
p151
aVFor one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,
p152
aVwhich is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
p153
aVI remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts \u2014
p154
aV"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
p155
aVAnd one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
p160
aVIt says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
p161
aVSilas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
p162
aVThis one generates no imagery at all."
p163
aVI am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
p164
aVWhich is something you never want to do professionally.
p165
aV"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
p166
aVWhat's the heart of this poem?
p167
aVDon't be trendy if you want to be serious.
p168
aVIs doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
p169
aa(lp170
VI guess one could reduce the idea further
p171
aVby suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,
p172
aVlike this."
p173
aVAnd then I show you a little drawing \u2014
p174
aVyou see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
p175
aVWell, I found a way to use it.
p176
aVSo, there's that little alternative over there,
p177
aVand I say, "Not bad," \u2014 criticizing myself \u2014
p178
aV"but more didactic than visual.
p179
aVMaybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,
p180
aVa kind of dance where each defines the other."
p181
aVAnd then more self-questioning \u2014 "Am I being simple-minded?
p182
aVIs this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
p183
aVThere's a significant difference.
p184
aVThis could be embarrassing.
p185
aVActually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
p186
aVDo you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VWell, I think there are two fresh things here \u2014 two fresh things.
p191
aVOne is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,
p192
aVand not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
p193
aVAnd as you know, you have to have a front.
p194
aVI mean \u2014 you've got to be confident;
p195
aVif you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
p196
aVSo that's one thing,
p197
aVto introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
p198
aVThat can be a big contribution.
p199
aVThe other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;
p200
aVyou get the big one
p201
aVand if you don't like that, how about the little one?
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd that too is a relatively new idea.
p206
aVAnd here's just a series of experiments
p207
aVwhere I ask the question of \u2014 does a poster have to be square?
p208
aVNow, this is a little illusion.
p209
aVThat poster is not folded.
p210
aVIt's not folded, that's a photograph
p211
aVand it's cut on the diagonal.
p212
aVSame cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
p213
aVAnd here,
p214
aVa very peculiar poster because,
p215
aVsimply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,
p216
aVit won't sit still in the space.
p217
aVAt times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,
p218
aVand then it shifts.
p219
aVAnd if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
p220
aVBut, we don't have time.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd then an experiment \u2014
p225
aVa little bit about the nature of perspective,
p226
aVwhere the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,
p227
aVbut the shape of the bottle \u2014 which is identical to the outside shape \u2014
p228
aVis seen frontally.
p229
aVAnd another piece for the art directors' club
p230
aVis "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
p231
aVThis is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
p232
aVThere were 10 artists invited to participate in it,
p233
aVand it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive
p234
aVand I didn't want to be embarrassed,
p235
aVso I worked very hard on this.
p236
aVThe idea was \u2014 and it was a brilliant idea \u2014
p237
aVwas to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system
p238
aVso every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,
p239
aVall of which had a different idea of what art is.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is"
p242
aVand trying to determine what art was.
p243
aVBut then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
p244
aVAnd as soon as I said that,
p245
aVI discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"
p246
aVand that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
p247
aVBut then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
p248
aVMy intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,
p249
aVin case you don't get it.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VNow this says, "Note to the viewer:
p254
aVI thought I might use a visual cliche of our time \u2014 Magritte's everyman \u2014
p255
aVto express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
p256
aVI'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,
p257
aVsurrealism has become banal,
p258
aVa shadow of its former self.
p259
aVThe phrase 'Art is whatever'
p260
aVexpresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making \u2014
p261
aVa sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster
p264
aVa poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'
p265
aVhidden in the word 'whatever.'
p266
aVThe four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:
p267
aVas a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,
p268
aVand the shape of the thing.
p269
aVWhatever."
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VOK.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Applause)
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd the one that I did not submit,
p278
aVwhich I still like,
p279
aVI wanted to use the same phrase.
p280
aVThere were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari
p281
aVon letterforms some years ago \u2014
p282
aVsort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
p283
aVAnd that idea stuck in my head.
p284
aVBut then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
p285
aVAnd, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
p286
aVBut what really happens is that you read it as:
p287
aV"Art is whatever remains."
