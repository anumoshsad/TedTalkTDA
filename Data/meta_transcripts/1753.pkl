VI'm going to share with you a paradigm-shifting perspective
p4
aVon the issues of gender violence: sexual assault, domestic violence,
p5
aVrelationship abuse, sexual harassment, sexual abuse of children.
p6
aVThat whole range of issues
p7
aVthat I'll refer to in shorthand as "gender violence issues,"
p8
aVthey've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with,
p9
aVbut I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it.
p10
aVI don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with.
p11
aVIn fact, I'm going to argue that these are men's issues,
p12
aVfirst and foremost.
p13
aVNow obviously \u2014
p14
aa(lp15
V(Applause)
p16
aa(lp17
VObviously, they're also women's issues, so I appreciate that,
p18
aVbut calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem,
p19
aVfor a number of reasons.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention, right?
p22
aVA lot of men hear the term "women's issues"
p23
aVand we tend to tune it out, and we think,
p24
aV"I'm a guy; that's for the girls," or "that's for the women."
p25
aVAnd a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result.
p26
aVIt's almost like a chip in our brain is activated,
p27
aVand the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction
p28
aVwhen we hear the term "women's issues."
p29
aVThis is also true, by the way, of the word "gender,"
p30
aVbecause a lot of people hear the word "gender"
p31
aVand they think it means "women."
p32
aVSo they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues.
p33
aVThere's some confusion about the term gender.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy.
p36
aVSo let's talk for a moment about race.
p37
aVIn the US, when we hear the word "race,"
p38
aVa lot of people think that means African-American,
p39
aVLatino, Asian-American, Native American,
p40
aVSouth Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
p41
aVA lot of people, when they hear the word "sexual orientation"
p42
aVthink it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
p43
aVAnd a lot of people, when they hear the word "gender,"
p44
aVthink it means women.
p45
aVIn each case, the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to.
p46
aVAs if white people don't have some sort of racial identity
p47
aVor belong to some racial category or construct,
p48
aVas if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation,
p49
aVas if men don't have a gender.
p50
aVThis is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves,
p51
aVwhich is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged
p52
aVto even think about its dominance,
p53
aVbecause that's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege,
p54
aVthe ability to go unexamined,
p55
aVlacking introspection, in fact being rendered invisible, in large measure,
p56
aVin the discourse about issues that are primarily about us.
p57
aVAnd this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence,
p58
aVhow men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation
p59
aVabout a subject that is centrally about men.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd I'm going to illustrate what I'm talking about
p62
aVby using the old tech.
p63
aVI'm old school on some fundamental regards.
p64
aVI make films and I work with high tech,
p65
aVbut I'm still old school as an educator,
p66
aVand I want to share with you this exercise
p67
aVthat illustrates on the sentence-structure level
p68
aVhow the way that we think, literally the way that we use language,
p69
aVconspires to keep our attention off of men.
p70
aVThis is about domestic violence in particular,
p71
aVbut you can plug in other analogues.
p72
aVThis comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.
p73
aa(lp74
VIt starts with a very basic English sentence:
p75
aV"John beat Mary."
p76
aVThat's a good English sentence.
p77
aVJohn is the subject, beat is the verb, Mary is the object, good sentence.
p78
aVNow we're going to move to the second sentence,
p79
aVwhich says the same thing in the passive voice.
p80
aV"Mary was beaten by John."
p81
aVAnd now a whole lot has happened in one sentence.
p82
aVWe've gone from "John beat Mary"
p83
aVto "Mary was beaten by John."
p84
aVWe've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary,
p85
aVand you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence,
p86
aVwell, close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain.
p87
aVThe third sentence, John is dropped,
p88
aVand we have, "Mary was beaten,"
p89
aVand now it's all about Mary.
p90
aVWe're not even thinking about John, it's totally focused on Mary.
p91
aVOver the past generation,
p92
aVthe term we've used synonymous with "beaten" is "battered,"
p93
aVso we have "Mary was battered."
p94
aVAnd the final sentence in this sequence, flowing from the others, is,
p95
aV"Mary is a battered woman."
p96
aVSo now Mary's very identity \u2014 Mary is a battered woman \u2014
p97
aVis what was done to her by John in the first instance.
p98
aVBut we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation.
p99
aa(lp100
VThose of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field
p101
aVknow that victim-blaming is pervasive in this realm,
p102
aVwhich is to say, blaming the person to whom something was done
p103
aVrather than the person who did it.
p104
aVAnd we say: why do they go out with these men?
p105
aVWhy are they attracted to them? Why do they keep going back?
p106
aVWhat was she wearing at that party? What a stupid thing to do.
p107
aVWhy was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room?
p108
aVThis is victim blaming, and there are many reasons for it,
p109
aVbut one is that our cognitive structure is set up to blame victims.
p110
aVThis is all unconscious.
p111
aVOur whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions
p112
aVabout women and women's choices and what they're doing, thinking, wearing.
p113
aVAnd I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women.
p114
aVIt's a legitimate thing to ask.
p115
aVBut's let's be clear: Asking questions about Mary
p116
aVis not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence.
p117
aa(lp118
VWe have to ask a different set of questions.
p119
aVThe questions are not about Mary, they're about John.
p120
aVThey include things like, why does John beat Mary?
p121
aVWhy is domestic violence still a big problem in the US and all over the world?
p122
aVWhat's going on? Why do so many men abuse physically,
p123
aVemotionally, verbally, and other ways,
p124
aVthe women and girls, and the men and boys, that they claim to love?
p125
aVWhat's going on with men?
p126
aVWhy do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and boys?
p127
aVWhy is that a common problem in our society
p128
aVand all over the world today?
p129
aVWhy do we hear over and over again
p130
aVabout new scandals erupting in major institutions
p131
aVlike the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program
p132
aVor the Boy Scouts of America, on and on and on?
p133
aVAnd then local communities all over the country
p134
aVand all over the world.
p135
aVWe hear about it all the time.
p136
aVThe sexual abuse of children.
p137
aVWhat's going on with men? Why do so many men rape women
p138
aVin our society and around the world?
p139
aVWhy do so many men rape other men?
p140
aVWhat is going on with men?
p141
aVAnd then what is the role of the various institutions in our society
p142
aVthat are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates?
p143
aa(lp144
VBecause this isn't about individual perpetrators.
p145
aVThat's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper
p146
aVand more systematic social problem.
p147
aVThe perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp
p148
aVand come into town and do their nasty business
p149
aVand then retreat into the darkness.
p150
aVThat's a very naive notion, right?
p151
aVPerpetrators are much more normal than that, and everyday than that.
p152
aVSo the question is, what are we doing here in our society and in the world?
p153
aVWhat are the roles of various institutions
p154
aVin helping to produce abusive men?
p155
aVWhat's the role of religious belief systems,
p156
aVthe sports culture, the pornography culture,
p157
aVthe family structure, economics, and how that intersects,
p158
aVand race and ethnicity and how that intersects?
p159
aVHow does all this work?
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then, once we start making those kinds of connections
p162
aVand asking those important and big questions,
p163
aVthen we can talk about how we can be transformative,
p164
aVin other words, how can we do something differently?
p165
aVHow can we change the practices?
p166
aVHow can we change the socialization of boys
p167
aVand the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes?
p168
aVThese are the kind of questions that we need to be asking
p169
aVand the kind of work that we need to be doing,
p170
aVbut if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking
p171
aVin relationships or elsewhere,
p172
aVwe're not going to get to that piece.
p173
aa(lp174
VI understand that a lot of women
p175
aVwho have been trying to speak out about these issues,
p176
aVtoday and yesterday and for years and years,
p177
aVoften get shouted down for their efforts.
p178
aVThey get called nasty names like "male-basher" and "man-hater,"
p179
aVand the disgusting and offensive "feminazi", right?
p180
aVAnd you know what all this is about?
p181
aVIt's called kill the messenger.
p182
aVIt's because the women who are standing up
p183
aVand speaking out for themselves and for other women
p184
aVas well as for men and boys,
p185
aVit's a statement to them to sit down and shut up,
p186
aVkeep the current system in place,
p187
aVbecause we don't like it when people rock the boat.
p188
aVWe don't like it when people challenge our power.
p189
aVYou'd better sit down and shut up, basically.
p190
aVAnd thank goodness that women haven't done that.
p191
aVThank goodness that we live in a world
p192
aVwhere there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work
p195
aVis that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say,
p196
aVor, better yet, we can be heard saying some things
p197
aVthat women often can't be heard saying.
p198
aVNow, I appreciate that that's a problem, it's sexism, but it's the truth.
p199
aVSo one of the things that I say to men,
p200
aVand my colleagues and I always say this,
p201
aVis we need more men who have the courage and the strength
p202
aVto start standing up and saying some of this stuff,
p203
aVand standing with women and not against them
p204
aVand pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes
p205
aVand other kinds of nonsense.
p206
aVWe live in the world together.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd by the way, one of the things that really bothers me
p209
aVabout some of the rhetoric against feminists and others
p210
aVwho have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world
p211
aVis that somehow, like I said, that they're anti-male.
p212
aVWhat about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way
p213
aVby what some adult man is doing against their mother, themselves, their sisters?
p214
aVWhat about all those boys?
p215
aVWhat about all the young men and boys
p216
aVwho have been traumatized by adult men's violence?
p217
aVYou know what?
p218
aVThe same system that produces men who abuse women,
p219
aVproduces men who abuse other men.
p220
aVAnd if we want to talk about male victims, let's talk about male victims.
p221
aVMost male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence.
p222
aVSo that's something that both women and men have in common.
p223
aVWe are both victims of men's violence.
p224
aVSo we have it in our direct self-interest,
p225
aVnot to mention the fact that most men that I know
p226
aVhave women and girls that we care deeply about,
p227
aVin our families and our friendship circles and every other way.
p228
aVSo there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out.
p229
aVIt seems obvious saying it out loud, doesn't it?
p230
aVNow, the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do
p231
aVin the sports culture and the US military, in schools,
p232
aVwe pioneered this approach called the bystander approach
p233
aVto gender-violence prevention.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach,
p236
aVbecause it's a big thematic shift,
p237
aValthough there's lots of particulars,
p238
aVbut the heart of it is, instead of seeing men as perpetrators
p239
aVand women as victims,
p240
aVor women as perpetrators, men as victims,
p241
aVor any combination in there.
p242
aVI'm using the gender binary.
p243
aVI know there's more than men and women, there's more than male and female.
p244
aVAnd there are women who are perpetrators,
p245
aVand of course there are men who are victims.
p246
aVThere's a whole spectrum.
p247
aVBut instead of seeing it in the binary fashion,
p248
aVwe focus on all of us as what we call bystanders,
p249
aVand a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim
p250
aVin a given situation,
p251
aVso in other words friends, teammates, colleagues, coworkers, family members,
p252
aVthose of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse,
p253
aVbut we are embedded in social, family, work, school,
p254
aVand other peer culture relationships
p255
aVwith people who might be in that situation.
p256
aVWhat do we do? How do we speak up? How do we challenge our friends?
p257
aVHow do we support our friends?
p258
aVBut how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse?
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, when it comes to men and male culture,
p261
aVthe goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are.
p262
aVAnd when I say abusive, I don't mean just men who are beating women.
p263
aVWe're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend
p264
aVneeds to stop the guy at the moment of attack.
p265
aVThat's a naive way of creating a social change.
p266
aVIt's along a continuum, we're trying to get men to interrupt each other.
p267
aVSo, for example, if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys
p268
aVplaying poker, talking, hanging out, no women present,
p269
aVand another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women,
p270
aVinstead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it,
p271
aVwe need men to say, "Hey, that's not funny.
p272
aVthat could be my sister you're talking about,
p273
aVand could you joke about something else?
p274
aVOr could you talk about something else?
p275
aVI don't appreciate that kind of talk."
p276
aVJust like if you're a white person
p277
aVand another white person makes a racist comment, you'd hope, I hope,
p278
aVthat white people would interrupt that racist enactment
p279
aVby a fellow white person.
p280
aVJust like with heterosexism, if you're a heterosexual person
p281
aVand you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors
p282
aVtowards people of varying sexual orientations,
p283
aVif you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that,
p284
aVthen, in a sense, isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity?
p285
aa(lp286
VWell, the bystander approach is trying to give people tools
p287
aVto interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate
p288
aVwhere the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable,
p289
aVnot just because it's illegal, but because it's wrong
p290
aVand unacceptable in the peer culture.
p291
aVAnd if we can get to the place where men
p292
aVwho act out in sexist ways will lose status,
p293
aVyoung men and boys who act out in sexist
p294
aVand harassing ways towards girls and women,
p295
aVas well as towards other boys and men,
p296
aVwill lose status as a result of it, guess what?
p297
aVWe'll see a radical diminution of the abuse.
p298
aVBecause the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted.
p299
aVHe's a normal guy in every other way, isn't he?
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, among the many great things that Martin Luther King
p302
aVsaid in his short life was,
p303
aV"In the end, what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies
p304
aVbut the silence of our friends."
p305
aVIn the end, what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies
p306
aVbut the silence of our friends.
p307
aVThere's been an awful lot of silence in male culture
p308
aVabout this ongoing tragedy of men's violence
p309
aVagainst women and children, hasn't there?
p310
aVThere's been an awful lot of silence.
p311
aVAnd all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence,
p312
aVand we need more men to do that.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow, it's easier said than done,
p315
aVbecause I'm saying it now,
p316
aVbut I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture
p317
aVfor guys to challenge each other,
p318
aVwhich is one of the reasons
p319
aVwhy part of the paradigm shift that has to happen
p320
aVis not just understanding these issues as men's issues,
p321
aVbut they're also leadership issues for men.
p322
aVBecause ultimately, the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues
p323
aVshould not fall on the shoulders of little boys
p324
aVor teenage boys in high school or college men.
p325
aVIt should be on adult men with power.
p326
aVAdult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable
p327
aVfor being leaders on these issues,
p328
aVbecause when somebody speaks up in a peer culture
p329
aVand challenges and interrupts,
p330
aVhe or she is being a leader, really.
p331
aVBut on a big scale, we need more adult men with power
p332
aVto start prioritizing these issues,
p333
aVand we haven't seen that yet, have we?
p334
aa(lp335
VNow, I was at a dinner a number of years ago,
p336
aVand I work extensively with the US military, all the services.
p337
aVAnd I was at this dinner and this woman said to me \u2014
p338
aVI think she thought she was a little clever \u2014
p339
aVshe said, "So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines?"
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd I said, "With all due respect,
p342
aVI don't do sensitivity training with the Marines.
p343
aVI run a leadership program in the Marine Corps."
p344
aa(lp345
VNow, I know it's a bit pompous, my response,
p346
aVbut it's an important distinction,
p347
aVbecause I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training.
p348
aVWe need leadership training, because, for example,
p349
aVwhen a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team \u2014
p350
aVand I work extensively in that realm as well \u2014
p351
aVmakes a sexist comment, makes a homophobic statement,
p352
aVmakes a racist comment,
p353
aVthere will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio.
p354
aVAnd some people will say, "He needs sensitivity training."
p355
aVOther people will say, "Well, get off it.
p356
aVThat's political correctness run amok,
p357
aVhe made a stupid statement, move on."
p358
aVMy argument is, he doesn't need sensitivity training.
p359
aVHe needs leadership training,
p360
aVbecause he's being a bad leader,
p361
aVbecause in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity \u2014
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
Vand racial and ethnic diversity,
p366
aVyou make those kind of comments, you're failing at your leadership.
p367
aVIf we can make this point that I'm making
p368
aVto powerful men and women in our society
p369
aVat all levels of institutional authority and power,
p370
aVit's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking.
p371
aa(lp372
VYou know, for example,
p373
aVI work a lot in college and university athletics
p374
aVthroughout North America.
p375
aVWe know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence, right?
p376
aVThere's no excuse for a college or university
p377
aVto not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training
p378
aVmandated for all student athletes, coaches, administrators,
p379
aVas part of their educational process.
p380
aVWe know enough to know that we can easily do that.
p381
aVBut you know what's missing? The leadership.
p382
aVBut it's not the leadership of student athletes.
p383
aVIt's the leadership of the athletic director,
p384
aVthe president of the university, the people in charge
p385
aVwho make decisions about resources
p386
aVand who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings.
p387
aVThat's a failure, in most cases, of men's leadership.
p388
aa(lp389
VLook at Penn State.
p390
aVPenn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach.
p391
aVYou had so many situations in that realm
p392
aVwhere men in powerful positions failed to act
p393
aVto protect children, in this case, boys.
p394
aVIt's unbelievable, really.
p395
aVBut when you get into it, you realize there are pressures on men.
p396
aVThere are constraints within peer cultures on men,
p397
aVwhich is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd one of the ways to do that is to say
p400
aVthere's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues.
p401
aVI know this, I work with men,
p402
aVand I've been working with tens of thousands,
p403
aVhundreds of thousands of men for many decades now.
p404
aVIt's scary, when you think about it, how many years.
p405
aVBut there's so many men who care deeply about these issues,
p406
aVbut caring deeply is not enough.
p407
aVWe need more men with the guts,
p408
aVwith the courage, with the strength, with the moral integrity
p409
aVto break our complicit silence and challenge each other
p410
aVand stand with women and not against them.
p411
aa(lp412
VBy the way, we owe it to women.
p413
aVThere's no question about it.
p414
aVBut we also owe it to our sons.
p415
aVWe also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world
p416
