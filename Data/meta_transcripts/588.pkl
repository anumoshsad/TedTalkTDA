VThis is the exact moment
p4
aVthat I started creating something called Tinkering School.
p5
aa(lp6
VTinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks
p7
aVand hammers and other dangerous objects,
p8
aVand be trusted.
p9
aVTrusted not to hurt themselves,
p10
aVand trusted not to hurt others.
p11
aVTinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,
p12
aVand there are no tests.
p13
aVWe're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen the kids arrive
p16
aVthey're confronted with lots of stuff:
p17
aVwood and nails and rope and wheels,
p18
aVand lots of tools, real tools.
p19
aVIt's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
p20
aVAnd within that context, we can offer the kids time \u2014
p21
aVsomething that seems in short supply
p22
aVin their over-scheduled lives.
p23
aVOur goal is to ensure that they leave
p24
aVwith a better sense of how to make things
p25
aVthan when they arrived,
p26
aVand the deep internal realization
p27
aVthat you can figure things out by fooling around.
p28
aa(lp29
VNothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVAnd the kids soon learn
p32
aVthat all projects go awry \u2014
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVand become at ease with the idea that every step
p35
aVin a project is a step closer
p36
aVto sweet success,
p37
aVor gleeful calamity.
p38
aVWe start from doodles and sketches.
p39
aVAnd sometimes we make real plans.
p40
aVAnd sometimes we just start building.
p41
aVBuilding is at the heart of the experience:
p42
aVhands on, deeply immersed
p43
aVand fully committed to the problem at hand.
p44
aVRobin and I, acting as collaborators,
p45
aVkeep the landscape of the projects
p46
aVtilted towards completion.
p47
aVSuccess is in the doing,
p48
aVand failures are celebrated and analyzed.
p49
aVProblems become puzzles
p50
aVand obstacles disappear.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhen faced with particularly difficult
p53
aVsetbacks or complexities,
p54
aVa really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVDecoration of the unfinished project
p57
aVis a kind of conceptual incubation.
p58
aVFrom these interludes come deep insights
p59
aVand amazing new approaches to solving the problems
p60
aVthat had them frustrated just moments before.
p61
aa(lp62
VAll materials are available for use.
p63
aVEven those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags
p64
aVcan become a bridge
p65
aVstronger than anyone imagined.
p66
aVAnd the things that they build
p67
aVamaze even themselves.
p68
aa(lp69
VVideo: Three, two, one, go!
