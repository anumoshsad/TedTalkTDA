VI thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.
p4
aVAnd I like to immerse myself in my topics.
p5
aVI just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
p6
aVAnd I see my life as a series of experiments.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,
p9
aVI wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"
p10
aVwhere I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,
p11
aVto live my life for me.
p12
aVSo, they answered my emails.
p13
aVThey answered my phone.
p14
aVThey argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.
p15
aVIt was the best month of my life,
p16
aVbecause I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
p17
aVIt was a wonderful experience.
p18
aa(lp19
VMore recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called \u2014
p20
aVabout radical honesty.
p21
aVAnd this is a movement where \u2014
p22
aVthis is started by a psychologist in Virginia,
p23
aVwho says that you should never, ever lie,
p24
aVexcept maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.
p25
aVAnd, more than that, whatever is on your brain
p26
aVshould come out of your mouth.
p27
aVSo, I decided I would try this for a month.
p28
aVThis was the worst month of my life.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVI do not recommend this at all.
p31
aVTo give you a sense of the experience,
p32
aVthe article was called, "I Think You're Fat."
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVSo, that was hard.
p35
aa(lp36
VMy most recent book \u2014 my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"
p37
aVand it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica
p38
aVfrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,
p39
aVor more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,
p40
aVall the way to Zwyiec, which is \u2014 well, I don't want to ruin the ending.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVIt's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.
p43
aVBut I love that one,
p44
aVbecause that was an experiment about how much information
p45
aVone human brain could absorb.
p46
aVAlthough, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.
p47
aVYou can just Google it.
p48
aVSo, I wasted some time there.
p49
aa(lp50
VI love those experiments,
p51
aVbut I think that the most profound
p52
aVand life-changing experiment that I've done
p53
aVis my most recent experiment, where I spent a year
p54
aVtrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,
p55
aV"The Year of Living Biblically."
p56
aVAnd I undertook this for two reasons.
p57
aVThe first was that I grew up with no religion at all.
p58
aVAs I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way
p59
aVthe Olive Garden is Italian.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVSo, not very.
p62
aVBut I've become increasingly interested in religion.
p63
aVI do think it's the defining issue of our time,
p64
aVor one of the main ones.
p65
aVAnd I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.
p66
aVSo, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe second reason I undertook this is because
p69
aVI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,
p70
aVreligious fundamentalism, and people who say
p71
aVthey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,
p72
aVas high as 45 or 50 percent of America.
p73
aVSo I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?
p74
aVI decided to take it to its logical conclusion
p75
aVand take everything in the Bible literally,
p76
aVwithout picking and choosing.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.
p79
aVI had Christian bibles.
p80
aVI had Jewish bibles.
p81
aVA friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,
p82
aVwhere the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"
p83
aVas opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."
p84
aa(lp85
VThen I went down and I read several versions,
p86
aVand I wrote down every single law that I could find.
p87
aVAnd this was a very long list \u2014 over 700 rules.
p88
aVAnd they range from the famous ones that I had heard of \u2014
p89
aVThe Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
p90
aVSo I wanted to follow those.
p91
aVAnd actually, I take my projects very seriously,
p92
aVbecause I had twins during my year,
p93
aVso I definitely take my projects seriously.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut I also wanted to follow the hundreds
p96
aVof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.
p97
aVThere is the law in Leviticus,
p98
aV"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."
p99
aVI didn't know where my corners were,
p100
aVso I decided to let the whole thing grow,
p101
aVand this is what I looked like by the end.
p102
aVAs you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVMy wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.
p105
aVSo, certainly the challenge was there.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,
p108
aVso I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."
p109
aVYou only know if you try it.
p110
aVI got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.
p111
aVThe Bible says that if two men are in a fight,
p112
aVand the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,
p113
aVthen her hand shall be cut off.
p114
aVSo, I wanted to follow that rule.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVThat one I followed by default,
p117
aVby not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,
p118
aVlooking like she had a strong grip.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVSo \u2014 oh, there's another shot of my beard.
p121
aa(lp122
VI will say it was an amazing year
p123
aVbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.
p124
aVAnd there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.
p125
aVThe first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.
p126
aVYou know, I could spend a year not killing,
p127
aVbut spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying \u2014
p128
aVyou know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,
p129
aVso this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,
p132
aVbecause I couldn't believe how much
p133
aVmy behavior changed my thoughts.
p134
aVThis was one of the huge lessons of the year,
p135
aVis that I almost pretended to be a better person,
p136
aVand I became a little bit of a better person.
p137
aVSo I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,
p138
aVand you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.
p139
aVYou change your behavior, and you change your mind.
p140
aVSo, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,
p141
aVyou visit sick people in the hospital,
p142
aVand you will become more compassionate.
p143
aVYou donate money to a cause,
p144
aVand you become emotionally involved in that cause.
p145
aVSo, it really was cognitive psychology \u2014
p146
aVyou know, cognitive dissonance \u2014 that I was experiencing.
p147
aVThe Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,
p148
aVvery primitive cognitive psychology.
p149
aVIn the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,
p150
aVwhich, as we know, is actually true.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe second type of rule that was difficult to obey
p153
aVwas the rules that will get you into a little trouble
p154
aVin twenty-first-century America.
p155
aVAnd perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVBut it's a big part of the Bible,
p158
aVso I figured I had to address it.
p159
aVSo, I was able to stone one adulterer.
p160
aVIt happened \u2014 I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,
p161
aVso sandals and sort of a white robe,
p162
aVyou know, because again, the outer affects the inner.
p163
aVI wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.
p164
aVAnd this man came up to me and he said,
p165
aV"Why are you dressed like that?"
p166
aVAnd I explained my project,
p167
aVand he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"
p168
aVAnd I said, "Well, that would be great!"
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVAnd I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket
p171
aVthat I had been carrying around for weeks,
p172
aVhoping for just this interaction \u2014 and, you know, they were pebbles \u2014
p173
aVbut he grabbed them out of my hand.
p174
aVHe was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.
p175
aVBut he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.
p176
aVHe grabbed them out of my hand
p177
aVand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could \u2014
p178
aVeye for an eye \u2014 I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me
p181
aVto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
p182
aVHow can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,
p183
aVand yet so incredibly wise in others?
p184
aVHow should we view the Bible?
p185
aVShould we view it, you know, as original intent,
p186
aVlike a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?
p187
aVHow was the Bible written?
p188
aVAnd actually, since this is a tech crowd,
p189
aVI talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me
p190
aVof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors
p191
aVover hundreds of years.
p192
aVAnd it's sort of evolved.
p193
aVIt's not a book that was written and came down from on high.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo I thought I would end by telling you
p196
aVjust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons
p197
aVthat I learned from my year.
p198
aVThe first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.
p199
aVThis became very, very clear, early on.
p200
aVBecause if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,
p201
aVand stoning adulterers, or \u2014 here's another example.
p202
aVWell, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVIt's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut this one is \u2014 the Bible says that you cannot touch women
p207
aVduring certain times of the month, and more than that,
p208
aVyou cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
p209
aVAnd my wife thought this was very offensive,
p210
aVso she sat in every seat in our apartment,
p211
aVand I had to spend much of the year standing
p212
aVuntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo, you know, I met with creationists.
p215
aVI went to the creationists' museum.
p216
aVAnd these are the ultimate literalists.
p217
aVAnd it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.
p218
aVI would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.
p219
aVIt's just that their faith is so strong
p220
aVin this literal interpretation of the Bible
p221
aVthat they distort all the data to fit their model.
p222
aVAnd they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.
p225
aVThey really did a fantastic job.
p226
aVIf you're ever in Kentucky,
p227
aVthere's, you can see a movie of the flood,
p228
aVand they have sprinklers in the ceiling
p229
aVthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
p230
aVSo, whatever you think of creationism \u2014 and I think it's crazy \u2014
p231
aVthey did a great job.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VAnother lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.
p235
aVAnd this one was a big lesson because I was praying,
p236
aVgiving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.
p237
aVBut I was saying thanks all the time, every day,
p238
aVand I started to change my perspective.
p239
aVAnd I started to realize the hundreds of little things
p240
aVthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,
p241
aVthat I took for granted, as opposed to focusing
p242
aVon the three or four that went wrong.
p243
aVSo, this is actually a key to happiness for me,
p244
aVis to just remember when I came over here,
p245
aVthe car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.
p246
aVIt's a remarkable thing.
p247
aa(lp248
VThird, that thou shall have reverence.
p249
aVThis one was unexpected because I started the year
p250
aVas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,
p251
aVI became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.
p252
aVAnd I'm trying to start it as a movement.
p253
aVSo, if anyone wants to join,
p254
aVthe basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,
p255
aVthere's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,
p256
aVand that our rituals can be sacred.
p257
aVThe Sabbath can be sacred.
p258
aVThis was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,
p259
aVbecause I am a workaholic, so having this one day
p260
aVwhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.
p261
aVSo, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.
p262
aa(lp263
VThou shall not stereotype.
p264
aVThis one happened because
p265
aVI spent a lot of time with various religious communities
p266
aVthroughout America because I wanted it to be more
p267
aVthan about my journey.
p268
aVI wanted it to be about religion in America.
p269
aVSo, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.
p270
aVI'm very proud because
p271
aVI think I'm the only person in America
p272
aVto out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVAfter three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,
p275
aVhe's like, "I gotta go."
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aVOh, thank you very much.
p278
aVThank you. Bless you, bless you.
p279
aa(lp280
VBut it was interesting
p281
aVbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,
p282
aVevangelical Christianity, and I found that
p283
aVit's such a wide and varied movement
p284
aVthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.
p285
aVThere's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,
p286
aVand they focus on the red words in the Bible,
p287
aVwhich are the ones that Jesus spoke.
p288
aVThat's how they printed them in the old Bibles.
p289
aVAnd their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
p290
aVThey have a pamphlet that says,
p291
aV"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"
p292
aVand you open it up, and there's nothing in it.
p293
aVSo, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,
p294
aVhelping poor people.
p295
aVSo, this was very inspiring to me.
p296
aVI recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.
p297
aVThey're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree
p298
aVwith much of what they say.
p299
aa(lp300
VAlso, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.
p301
aVThis one was very unexpected because, you know,
p302
aVI grew up with the scientific worldview,
p303
aVand I was shocked learning how much of my life
p304
aVis governed by irrational forces.
p305
aVAnd the thing is, if they're not harmful,
p306
aVthey're not to be completely dismissed.
p307
aVBecause I learned that \u2014 I was thinking, I was
p308
aVdoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,
p309
aVseparating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people
p310
aV"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"
p311
aVAnd they said, "We don't know,
p312
aVbut it's just rituals that give us meaning."
p313
aVAnd I would say, "But that's crazy."
p314
aVAnd they would say, "Well, what about you?
p315
aVYou blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.
p316
aVIf a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy
p317
aVblowing out the fire on top of a cake
p318
aVversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,
p319
aVwould the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,
p320
aVbut that guy's crazy?'"
p321
aVSo no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.
p322
aVSo the key is to choose the right rituals,
p323
aVthe ones that are not harmful \u2014 but rituals by themselves
p324
aVare not to be dismissed.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.
p327
aVAnd this one I learned because
p328
aVI tried to follow everything in the Bible.
p329
aVAnd I failed miserably.
p330
aVBecause you can't.
p331
aVYou have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible
p332
aVis going to be picking and choosing.
p333
aVThe key is to pick and choose the right parts.
p334
aVThere's the phrase called cafeteria religion,
p335
aVand the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,
p336
aVand they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.
p337
aVYou're just picking and choosing."
p338
aVBut my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"
p339
aVI've had some great meals at cafeterias.
p340
aVI've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.
p341
aVSo, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,
p342
aVabout tolerance, about loving your neighbor,
p343
aVas opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,
p344
aVor intolerance, or violence,
p345
aVwhich are very much in the Bible as well.
p346
aVSo if we are to find any meaning in this book,
p347
aVthen we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd I thought I'd end with just a couple more.
p350
aVThere's me reading the Bible.
p351
aVThat's how I hailed taxicabs.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVSeriously, and it worked. And yes,
p354
aVthat was actually a rented sheep,
p355
aVso I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.
p356
aVSo, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
