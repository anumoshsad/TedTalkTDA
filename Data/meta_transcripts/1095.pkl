VI want to ask you all to consider for a second
p4
aVthe very simple fact
p5
aVthat, by far,
p6
aVmost of what we know about the universe
p7
aVcomes to us from light.
p8
aVWe can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky
p9
aVand see stars with our bare eyes.
p10
aVThe Sun burns our peripheral vision.
p11
aVWe see light reflected off the Moon.
p12
aVAnd in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope
p13
aVat the celestial bodies,
p14
aVthe known universe has come to us through light,
p15
aVacross vast eras in cosmic history.
p16
aVAnd with all of our modern telescopes,
p17
aVwe've been able to collect
p18
aVthis stunning silent movie of the universe \u2014
p19
aVthese series of snapshots
p20
aVthat go all the way back to the Big Bang.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd yet, the universe is not a silent movie
p23
aVbecause the universe isn't silent.
p24
aVI'd like to convince you
p25
aVthat the universe has a soundtrack
p26
aVand that soundtrack is played on space itself,
p27
aVbecause space can wobble like a drum.
p28
aVIt can ring out a kind of recording
p29
aVthroughout the universe
p30
aVof some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
p31
aVNow we'd like to be able to add
p32
aVto a kind of glorious visual composition
p33
aVthat we have of the universe \u2014
p34
aVa sonic composition.
p35
aVAnd while we've never heard the sounds from space,
p36
aVwe really should, in the next few years,
p37
aVstart to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo in this ambition
p40
aVto capture songs from the universe,
p41
aVwe turn our focus
p42
aVto black holes and the promise they have,
p43
aVbecause black holes can bang on space-time
p44
aVlike mallets on a drum
p45
aVand have a very characteristic song,
p46
aVwhich I'd like to play for you \u2014 some of our predictions
p47
aVfor what that song will be like.
p48
aVNow black holes are dark against a dark sky.
p49
aVWe can't see them directly.
p50
aVThey're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.
p51
aVWe can see them indirectly,
p52
aVbecause black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
p53
aVThey destroy stars around them.
p54
aVThey churn up debris in their surroundings.
p55
aVBut they won't come to us directly through light.
p56
aVWe might one day see a shadow
p57
aVa black hole can cast on a very bright background,
p58
aVbut we haven't yet.
p59
aVAnd yet black holes may be heard
p60
aVeven if they're not seen,
p61
aVand that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum
p64
aVto Albert Einstein \u2014 to whom we owe so much.
p65
aVEinstein realized that if space were empty,
p66
aVif the universe were empty,
p67
aVit would be like this picture,
p68
aVexcept for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
p69
aVBut if we were freely falling through the space,
p70
aVeven without this helpful grid,
p71
aVwe might be able to paint it ourselves,
p72
aVbecause we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,
p73
aVundeflected straight paths
p74
aVthrough the universe.
p75
aVEinstein also realized \u2014
p76
aVand this is the real meat of the matter \u2014
p77
aVthat if you put energy or mass in the universe,
p78
aVit would curve space,
p79
aVand a freely falling object
p80
aVwould pass by, let's say, the Sun
p81
aVand it would be deflected
p82
aValong the natural curves in the space.
p83
aVIt was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
p84
aVNow even light will be bent by those paths.
p85
aVAnd you can be bent so much
p86
aVthat you're caught in orbit around the Sun,
p87
aVas the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
p88
aVThese are the natural curves in space.
p89
aa(lp90
VWhat Einstein did not realize
p91
aVwas that, if you took our Sun
p92
aVand you crushed it down to six kilometers \u2014
p93
aVso you took a million times the mass of the Earth
p94
aVand you crushed it to six kilometers across,
p95
aVyou would make a black hole,
p96
aVan object so dense
p97
aVthat if light veered too close, it would never escape \u2014
p98
aVa dark shadow against the universe.
p99
aVIt wasn't Einstein who realized this,
p100
aVit was Karl Schwarzschild
p101
aVwho was a German Jew in World War I \u2014
p102
aVjoined the German army already an accomplished scientist,
p103
aVworking on the Russian front.
p104
aVI like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches
p105
aVcalculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,
p106
aVand then, in between,
p107
aVcalculating Einstein's equations \u2014
p108
aVas you do in the trenches.
p109
aVAnd he was reading Einstein's recently published
p110
aVgeneral theory of relativity,
p111
aVand he was thrilled by this theory.
p112
aVAnd he quickly surmised
p113
aVan exact mathematical solution
p114
aVthat described something very extraordinary:
p115
aVcurves so strong
p116
aVthat space would rain down into them,
p117
aVspace itself would curve like a waterfall
p118
aVflowing down the throat of a hole.
p119
aVAnd even light could not escape this current.
p120
aVLight would be dragged down the hole
p121
aVas everything else would be,
p122
aVand all that would be left would be a shadow.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow he wrote to Einstein,
p125
aVand he said, "As you will see,
p126
aVthe war has been kind to me enough.
p127
aVDespite the heavy gunfire,
p128
aVI've been able to get away from it all
p129
aVand walk through the land of your ideas."
p130
aVAnd Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,
p131
aVand I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.
p132
aVThis is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.
p133
aVAnd he took Schwarzschild's idea
p134
aVto the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.
p135
aVBut Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
p136
aVHe did not believe they existed in nature.
p137
aVHe thought nature would protect us from their formation.
p138
aVIt was decades
p139
aVbefore the term "black hole" was coined
p140
aVand people realized
p141
aVthat black holes are real astrophysical objects \u2014
p142
aVin fact they're the death state
p143
aVof very massive stars
p144
aVthat collapse catastrophically
p145
aVat the end of their lifetime.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
p148
aVIt's actually not massive enough.
p149
aVBut if we did a little thought experiment \u2014
p150
aVas Einstein was very fond of doing \u2014
p151
aVwe could imagine
p152
aVputting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,
p153
aVand putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,
p154
aVmaybe 30 kilometers
p155
aVoutside of the black-hole sun.
p156
aVAnd it would be self-illuminated,
p157
aVbecause now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light \u2014
p158
aVso let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
p159
aVAnd you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit
p160
aVeven 30 km
p161
aVoutside of this crushed black hole.
p162
aVThis crushed black hole
p163
aVactually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
p164
aVIt might spill off into the Hudson a little bit
p165
aVbefore it destroyed the Earth.
p166
aVBut basically that's what we're talking about.
p167
aVWe're talking about an object that you could crush down
p168
aVto half the square area of Manhattan.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo we move this Earth very close \u2014
p171
aV30 kilometers outside \u2014
p172
aVand we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
p173
aVThere's a sort of myth
p174
aVthat black holes devour everything in the universe,
p175
aVbut you actually have to get very close to fall in.
p176
aVBut what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,
p177
aVwe can always see the Earth.
p178
aVIt cannot hide behind the black hole.
p179
aVThe light from the Earth, some of it falls in,
p180
aVbut some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
p181
aVSo you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
p182
aVIf this were Battlestar Galactica
p183
aVand you're fighting the Cylons,
p184
aVdon't hide behind the black hole.
p185
aVThey can see you.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole \u2014
p188
aVit's not massive enough \u2014
p189
aVbut there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
p190
aVAnd if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,
p191
aVthis is what it would look like.
p192
aVWe would see a shadow of that black hole
p193
aVagainst the hundred billion stars
p194
aVin the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
p195
aVAnd if we were to fall towards this black hole,
p196
aVwe would see all of that light lensed around it,
p197
aVand we could even start to cross into that shadow
p198
aVand really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
p199
aVIt would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there
p200
aVbecause we couldn't,
p201
aVanymore than light can escape.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut even though the black hole is dark from the outside,
p204
aVit's not dark on the inside,
p205
aVbecause all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
p206
aVAnd even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,
p207
aVour clocks would seem to slow down
p208
aVrelative to galactic time,
p209
aVit would look as though the evolution of the galaxy
p210
aVhad been sped up and shot at us,
p211
aVright before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
p212
aVIt would be like a near-death experience
p213
aVwhere you see the light at the end of the tunnel,
p214
aVbut it's a total death experience.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVAnd there's no way of telling anybody
p217
aVabout the light at the end of the tunnel.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,
p220
aVbut black holes can be heard,
p221
aVeven if they're not seen.
p222
aVImagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation \u2014
p223
aVimagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
p224
aVMaybe they started as stars
p225
aVand collapsed to two black holes \u2014
p226
aVeach one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
p227
aVSo now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
p228
aVThey can be spinning
p229
aVhundreds of times a second.
p230
aVAt the end of their lives,
p231
aVthey're going around each other very near the speed of light.
p232
aVSo they're crossing thousands of kilometers
p233
aVin a fraction of a second,
p234
aVand as they do so, they not only curve space,
p235
aVbut they leave behind in their wake
p236
aVa ringing of space,
p237
aVan actual wave on space-time.
p238
aVSpace squeezes and stretches
p239
aVas it emanates out from these black holes
p240
aVbanging on the universe.
p241
aVAnd they travel out into the cosmos
p242
aVat the speed of light.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis computer simulation
p245
aVis due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
p246
aVIt took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
p247
aVThis was one of the groups.
p248
aVIt shows two black holes in orbit around each other,
p249
aVagain, with these helpfully painted curves.
p250
aVAnd if you can see \u2014 it's kind of faint \u2014
p251
aVbut if you can see the red waves emanating out,
p252
aVthose are the gravitational waves.
p253
aVThey're literally the sounds of space ringing,
p254
aVand they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light
p255
aVas they ring down and coalesce
p256
aVto one spinning, quiet black hole
p257
aVat the end of the day.
p258
aVIf you were standing near enough,
p259
aVyour ear would resonate
p260
aVwith the squeezing and stretching of space.
p261
aVYou would literally hear the sound.
p262
aVNow of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,
p263
aVso you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
p264
aVBut I'd like to play for you
p265
aVthe sound that we predict.
p266
aa(lp267
VThis is from my group \u2014
p268
aVa slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
p269
aVImagine a lighter black hole
p270
aVfalling into a very heavy black hole.
p271
aVThe sound you're hearing
p272
aVis the light black hole banging on space
p273
aVeach time it gets close.
p274
aVIf it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
p275
aVBut it comes in like a mallet,
p276
aVand it literally cracks space,
p277
aVwobbling it like a drum.
p278
aVAnd we can predict what the sound will be.
p279
aVWe know that, as it falls in,
p280
aVit gets faster and it gets louder.
p281
aVAnd eventually,
p282
aVwe're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
p283
aV(Thumping)
p284
aVThen it's gone.
p285
aVNow I've never heard it that loud \u2014 it's actually more dramatic.
p286
aVAt home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
p287
aVIt's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
p288
aa(lp289
VThis is another sound from my group.
p290
aVNo, I'm not showing you any images,
p291
aVbecause black holes don't leave behind
p292
aVhelpful trails of ink,
p293
aVand space is not painted,
p294
aVshowing you the curves.
p295
aVBut if you were to float by in space on a space holiday
p296
aVand you heard this,
p297
aVyou want to get moving.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aVWant to get away from the sound.
p300
aVBoth black holes are moving.
p301
aVBoth black holes are getting closer together.
p302
aVIn this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
p303
aVAnd then they're going to merge.
p304
aV(Thumping)
p305
aVNow it's gone.
p306
aVNow that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging \u2014
p307
aVthat it chirps up at the end.
p308
aVNow that's our prediction
p309
aVfor what we'll see.
p310
aa(lp311
VLuckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
p312
aVAnd surely, somewhere in the universe
p313
aVtwo black holes have merged.
p314
aVAnd surely, the space around us
p315
aVis ringing
p316
aVafter traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,
p317
aVat the speed of light to get to us.
p318
aVBut the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
p319
aVThere are very industrious experiments being built on Earth \u2014
p320
aVone called LIGO \u2014
p321
aVwhich will detect deviations
p322
aVin the squeezing and stretching of space
p323
aVat less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom
p324
aVover four kilometers.
p325
aVIt's a remarkably ambitious experiment,
p326
aVand it's going to be at advanced sensitivity
p327
aVwithin the next few years \u2014 to pick this up.
p328
aVThere's also a mission proposed for space,
p329
aVwhich hopefully will launch in the next ten years,
p330
aVcalled LISA.
p331
aVAnd LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes \u2014
p332
aVblack holes millions or billions of times
p333
aVthe mass of the Sun.
p334
aa(lp335
VIn this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
p336
aVThey look like they're frozen in some embrace.
p337
aVAnd each one probably harbors
p338
aVa super-massive black hole at its core.
p339
aVBut they're not frozen;
p340
aVthey're actually merging.
p341
aVThese two black holes are colliding,
p342
aVand they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
p343
aVIt's beyond our human perception
p344
aVto pick up a song of that duration.
p345
aVBut LISA could see the final stages
p346
aVof two super-massive black holes
p347
aVearlier in the universe's history,
p348
aVthe last 15 minutes before they fall together.
p349
aVAnd it's not just black holes,
p350
aVbut it's also any big disturbance in the universe \u2014
p351
aVand the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
p352
aVWhen that expression was coined, it was derisive \u2014
p353
aVlike, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
p354
aVBut now it actually might be more technically accurate
p355
aVbecause it might bang.
p356
aVIt might make a sound.
p357
aa(lp358
VThis animation from my friends at Proton Studios
p359
aVshows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
p360
aVWe don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe
p361
aVbecause there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
p362
aVSo imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
p363
aVIt's everywhere, it's all around you,
p364
aVand the space is wobbling chaotically.
p365
aVFourteen billion years pass
p366
aVand this song is still ringing all around us.
p367
aVGalaxies form,
p368
aVand generations of stars form in those galaxies,
p369
aVand around one star,
p370
aVat least one star,
p371
aVis a habitable planet.
p372
aVAnd here we are frantically building these experiments,
p373
aVdoing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
p374
aa(lp375
VImagine a billion years ago,
p376
aVtwo black holes collided.
p377
aVThat song has been ringing through space
p378
aVfor all that time.
p379
aVWe weren't even here.
p380
aVIt gets closer and closer \u2014
p381
aV40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
p382
aVIt's like hurry, build your instruments.
p383
aVIt's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
p384
aVwhatever year it will be
p385
aVwhen our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity \u2014
p386
aVwe'll build them, we'll turn on the machines
p387
aVand, bang, we'll catch it \u2014 the first song from space.
p388
aVIf it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,
p389
aVit would sound like this.
p390
aV(Static) It's a terrible sound.
p391
aVIt's literally the definition of noise.
p392
aVIt's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
p393
aVBut it's around us everywhere, presumably,
p394
aVif it hasn't been wiped out
p395
aVby some other process in the universe.
p396
aVAnd if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears
p397
aVbecause it will be the quiet echo
p398
aVof that moment of our creation,
p399
aVof our observable universe.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo within the next few years,
p402
aVwe'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,
p403
aVrender the universe in audio.
p404
aVBut if we detect those earliest moments,
p405
aVit'll bring us that much closer
p406
aVto an understanding of the Big Bang,
p407
aVwhich brings us that much closer
p408
aVto asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
p409
aVIf we run the movie of our universe backwards,
p410
aVwe know that there was a Big Bang in our past,
p411
aVand we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,
p412
aVbut was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
p413
aVI mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
p414
aVWill it happen again?
p415
aVI mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge
p416
aVto reignite wonder,
p417
aVwe can ask questions, at least for this last minute,
p418
aVthat honestly might evade us forever.
p419
aa(lp420
VBut we have to ask:
p421
aVIs it possible that our universe
p422
aVis just a plume off of some greater history?
p423
aVOr, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse \u2014
p424
aVeach branch with its own Big Bang in its past \u2014
p425
aVmaybe some of them with black holes playing drums,
p426
aVmaybe some without \u2014
p427
aVmaybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without \u2014
p428
aVnot in our past, not in our future,
p429
aVbut somehow fundamentally connected to us?
p430
aVSo we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,
p431
aVin some other patch of that multiverse,
p432
aVare there creatures?
p433
aVHere's my multiverse creatures.
p434
aVAre there other creatures in the multiverse,
p435
aVwondering about us
p436
aVand wondering about their own origins?
p437
aVAnd if they are,
p438
aVI can imagine them as we are,
p439
aVcalculating, writing computer code,
p440
aVbuilding instruments,
p441
aVtrying to detect that faintest sound
p442
aVof their origins
p443
aVand wondering who else is out there.
