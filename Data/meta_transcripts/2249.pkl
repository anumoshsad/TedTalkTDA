VThese bees are in my backyard in Berkeley, California.
p6
aVUntil last year, I'd never kept bees before,
p7
aVbut National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them,
p8
aVand I decided, to be able to take compelling images,
p9
aVI should start keeping bees myself.
p10
aVAnd as you may know,
p11
aVbees pollinate one third of our food crops,
p12
aVand lately they've been having a really hard time.
p13
aVSo as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like.
p14
aVSo I'm going to show you what I found over the last year.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis furry little creature
p17
aVis a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell,
p18
aVand bees right now are dealing with several different problems,
p19
aVincluding pesticides, diseases, and habitat loss,
p20
aVbut the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia,
p21
aVVarroa destructor.
p22
aVAnd this pinhead-sized mite crawls onto young bees
p23
aVand sucks their blood.
p24
aVThis eventually destroys a hive
p25
aVbecause it weakens the immune system of the bees,
p26
aVand it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, bees are the most sensitive
p29
aVwhen they're developing inside their brood cells,
p30
aVand I wanted to know what that process really looks like,
p31
aVso I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis
p32
aVand figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera.
p33
aVI'm going to show you the first 21 days of a bee's life
p34
aVcondensed into 60 seconds.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva,
p37
aVand those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells
p38
aVfeeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them.
p39
aVThen, their head and their legs slowly differentiate
p40
aVas they transform into pupae.
p41
aVHere's that same pupation process,
p42
aVand you can actually see the mites running around in the cells.
p43
aVThen the tissue in their body reorganizes
p44
aVand the pigment slowly develops in their eyes.
p45
aVThe last step of the process is their skin shrivels up
p46
aVand they sprout hair.

p50
aa(lp51
VAs you can see halfway through that video,
p52
aVthe mites were running around on the baby bees,
p53
aVand the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites
p54
aVis they treat their hives with chemicals.
p55
aVIn the long run, that's bad news,
p56
aVso researchers are working on finding alternatives
p57
aVto control these mites.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis is one of those alternatives.
p60
aVIt's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,
p61
aVand this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, the researchers figured out
p64
aVthat some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites,
p65
aVso they set out to breed a line of mite-resistant bees.
p66
aVThis is what it takes to breed bees in a lab.
p67
aVThe virgin queen is sedated
p68
aVand then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument.
p69
aVNow, this procedure allows the researchers
p70
aVto control exactly which bees are being crossed,
p71
aVbut there's a tradeoff in having this much control.
p72
aVThey succeeded in breeding mite-resistant bees,
p73
aVbut in that process, those bees started to lose traits
p74
aVlike their gentleness and their ability to store honey,
p75
aVso to overcome that problem,
p76
aVthese researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers.
p77
aVThis is Bret Adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives.
p78
aVHe and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world,
p79
aVand the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his operation
p80
aVwith the hope that over time,
p81
aVthey'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite-resistant
p82
aVbut also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd to say it like that
p85
aVmakes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees,
p86
aVand the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years.
p87
aVWe took this wild creature and put it inside of a box,
p88
aVpractically domesticating it,
p89
aVand originally that was so that we could harvest their honey,
p90
aVbut over time we started losing our native pollinators,
p91
aVour wild pollinators,
p92
aVand there are many places now where those wild pollinators
p93
aVcan no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture,
p94
aVso these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo when people talk about saving bees,
p97
aVmy interpretation of that
p98
aVis we need to save our relationship to bees,
p99
aVand in order to design new solutions,
p100
aVwe have to understand the basic biology of bees
p101
aVand understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.
p102
aVIn other words, we have to understand bees up close.
p103
