VGood afternoon.
p4
aVThere's a medical revolution happening all around us,
p5
aVand it's one that's going to help us conquer
p6
aVsome of society's most dreaded conditions,
p7
aVincluding cancer.
p8
aVThe revolution is called angiogenesis,
p9
aVand it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo why should we care about blood vessels?
p12
aVWell, the human body is literally packed with them \u2014
p13
aV60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.
p14
aVEnd to end, that would form a line that would circle the earth twice.
p15
aVThe smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
p16
aVWe've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.
p17
aVAnd these are the vessels of life,
p18
aVand as I'll show you, they can also be the vessels of death.
p19
aVNow, the remarkable thing about blood vessels
p20
aVis that they have this ability
p21
aVto adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.
p22
aVFor example, in the liver, they form channels to detoxify the blood;
p23
aVin the lungs, they line air sacs for gas exchange.
p24
aVIn muscle, they corkscrew,
p25
aVso that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation.
p26
aVAnd in nerves, they course along like power lines,
p27
aVkeeping those nerves alive.
p28
aa(lp29
VWe get most of these blood vessels
p30
aVwhen we're actually still in the womb.
p31
aVAnd what that means is that as adults,
p32
aVblood vessels don't normally grow.
p33
aVExcept in a few special circumstances.
p34
aVIn women, blood vessels grow every month,
p35
aVto build the lining of the uterus.
p36
aVDuring pregnancy, they form the placenta,
p37
aVwhich connects mom and baby.
p38
aVAnd after injury, blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab
p39
aVin order to heal a wound.
p40
aVAnd this is actually what it looks like,
p41
aVhundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo the body has the ability to regulate
p44
aVthe amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.
p45
aVIt does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances,
p46
aVstimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,
p47
aVsuch that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,
p48
aVthe body can do this by releasing stimulators,
p49
aVproteins called angiogenic factors,
p50
aVthat act as natural fertilizer, and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
p51
aVWhen those excess vessels are no longer needed,
p52
aVthe body prunes them back to baseline,
p53
aVusing naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
p54
aVThere are other situations where we start beneath the baseline,
p55
aVand we need to grow more blood vessels, just to get back to normal levels \u2014
p56
aVfor example, after an injury \u2014
p57
aVand the body can do that too, but only to that normal level,
p58
aVthat set point.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut what we now know, is that for a number of diseases,
p61
aVthere are defects in the system,
p62
aVwhere the body can't prune back extra blood vessels,
p63
aVor can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time.
p64
aVAnd in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.
p65
aVAnd when angiogenesis is out of balance,
p66
aVa myriad of diseases result.
p67
aVFor example, insufficient angiogenesis \u2014 not enough blood vessels \u2014
p68
aVleads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,
p69
aVlegs without circulation, death from stroke,
p70
aVnerve damage.
p71
aVAnd on the other end, excessive angiogenesis \u2014
p72
aVtoo many blood vessels \u2014 drives disease,
p73
aVand we see this in cancer, blindness,
p74
aVarthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.
p75
aVIn total, there are more than 70 major diseases
p76
aVaffecting more than a billion people worldwide,
p77
aVthat all look on the surface to be different from one another,
p78
aVbut all actually share abnormal angiogenesis
p79
aVas their common denominator.
p80
aVAnd this realization is allowing us to re-conceptualize
p81
aVthe way that we actually approach these diseases,
p82
aVby controlling angiogenesis.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, I'm going to focus on cancer,
p85
aVbecause angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer \u2014
p86
aVevery type of cancer.
p87
aVSo here we go.
p88
aVThis is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass growing inside a brain.
p89
aVAnd under the microscope,
p90
aVyou can see hundreds of these brown-stained blood vessels,
p91
aVcapillaries that are feeding cancer cells,
p92
aVbringing oxygen and nutrients.
p93
aVBut cancers don't start out like this,
p94
aVand in fact, cancers don't start out with a blood supply.
p95
aVThey start out as small, microscopic nests of cells,
p96
aVthat can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size.
p97
aVThat's the tip of a ballpoint pen.
p98
aVThen they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,
p99
aVso they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn fact, we're probably forming these microscopic cancers
p102
aVall the time in our body.
p103
aVAutopsy studies from people who died in car accidents
p104
aVhave shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50
p105
aVactually have microscopic cancers in their breasts.
p106
aVAbout 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s
p107
aVhave microscopic prostate cancers,
p108
aVand virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s,
p109
aVwill have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.
p110
aVYet, without a blood supply,
p111
aVmost of these cancers will never become dangerous.
p112
aVDr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor
p113
aVand who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,
p114
aVonce called this "cancer without disease."
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the body's ability to balance angiogenesis,
p117
aVwhen it's working properly,
p118
aVprevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.
p119
aVAnd this turns out to be
p120
aVone of our most important defense mechanisms
p121
aVagainst cancer.
p122
aVIn fact, if you actually block angiogenesis
p123
aVand prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,
p124
aVtumors simply can't grow up.
p125
aVBut once angiogenesis occurs,
p126
aVcancers can grow exponentially.
p127
aVAnd this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless,
p128
aVto being deadly.
p129
aVCancer cells mutate,
p130
aVand they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors,
p131
aVnatural fertilizer,
p132
aVthat tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.
p133
aVAnd once those vessels invade the cancer,
p134
aVit can expand, it can invade local tissues,
p135
aVand the same vessels that are feeding tumors
p136
aVallow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases.
p137
aVAnd unfortunately, this late stage of cancer
p138
aVis the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed,
p139
aVwhen angiogenesis is already turned on,
p140
aVand cancer cells are growing like wild.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, if angiogenesis is a tipping point
p143
aVbetween a harmless cancer and a harmful one,
p144
aVthen one major part of the angiogenesis revolution
p145
aVis a new approach to treating cancer
p146
aVby cutting off the blood supply.
p147
aVWe call this antiangiogenic therapy,
p148
aVand it's completely different from chemotherapy,
p149
aVbecause it selectively aims
p150
aVat the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.
p151
aVWe can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels
p152
aVwe see in other places of the body \u2014
p153
aVthey're abnormal, they're very poorly constructed,
p154
aVand because of that, they're highly vulnerable
p155
aVto treatments that target them.
p156
aVIn effect, when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy \u2014
p157
aVhere, an experimental drug for a glioma,
p158
aVwhich is a type of brain tumor \u2014
p159
aVyou can see that there are dramatic changes that occur
p160
aVwhen the tumor is being starved.
p161
aVHere's a woman with a breast cancer,
p162
aVbeing treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,
p163
aVwhich is FDA approved.
p164
aVAnd you can see that the halo of blood flow
p165
aVdisappears after treatment.
p166
aa(lp167
VWell, I've just shown you two very different types of cancer
p168
aVthat both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.
p169
aVSo a few years ago, I asked myself,
p170
aV"Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers,
p171
aVeven in other species?"
p172
aVSo here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo,
p173
aVwho had a very aggressive tumor
p174
aVcalled a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.
p175
aVIt invaded into his lungs.
p176
aVHis veterinarian only gave him three months to live.
p177
aVSo we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs
p178
aVthat could be mixed into his dog food,
p179
aVas well as an antiangiogenic cream,
p180
aVthat could be applied on the surface of the tumor.
p181
aVAnd within a few weeks of treatment,
p182
aVwe were able to slow down that cancer's growth,
p183
aVsuch that we were ultimately able to extend Milo\u2019s survival
p184
aVto six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,
p185
aVall with a very good quality of life.
p186
aVAnd we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.
p187
aVWe have about a 60 percent response rate,
p188
aVand improved survival for these pets
p189
aVthat were about to be euthanized.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples.
p192
aVThis is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,
p193
aVand she had these lesions in her mouth
p194
aVthat, over the course of three years,
p195
aVdeveloped into invasive squamous cell cancers.
p196
aVSo we created an antiangiogenic paste.
p197
aVWe had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.
p198
aVAnd over the course of seven months,
p199
aVthe cancers completely disappeared,
p200
aVand the biopsies came back as normal.
p201
aa(lp202
VHere's a cancer growing on the lip
p203
aVof a Quarter Horse named Guinness.
p204
aVIt's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.
p205
aVIt had already spread to his lymph nodes,
p206
aVso we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip,
p207
aVand the oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside.
p208
aVAnd over the course of six months,
p209
aVhe experienced a complete remission.
p210
aVAnd here he is six years later,
p211
aVGuinness, with his very happy owner.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Applause)
p214
aa(lp215
VNow obviously, antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers.
p216
aVAnd in fact, the first pioneering treatments
p217
aVfor people as well as dogs,
p218
aVare already becoming available.
p219
aVThere are 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.
p220
aVBut the real question is:
p221
aVHow well do these work in practice?
p222
aVSo here's actually the patient survival data
p223
aVfrom eight different types of cancer.
p224
aVThe bars represent survival time
p225
aVtaken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy,
p226
aVor surgery, or radiation available.
p227
aVBut starting in 2004,
p228
aVwhen antiangiogenic therapies first became available,
p229
aVyou can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival
p230
aVfor people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,
p231
aVcolorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
p232
aVThat's impressive.
p233
aVBut for other tumors and cancer types,
p234
aVthe improvements have only been modest.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo I started asking myself,
p237
aV"Why haven't we been able to do better?"
p238
aVAnd the answer, to me, is obvious:
p239
aVwe're treating cancer too late in the game,
p240
aVwhen it's already established,
p241
aVand oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.
p242
aVAnd as a doctor,
p243
aVI know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,
p244
aVachieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.
p245
aVSo I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking:
p246
aVCould the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis,
p247
aVbeating cancer at its own game,
p248
aVso the cancers could never become dangerous?
p249
aVThis could help healthy people,
p250
aVas well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice,
p251
aVand want to find a way to keep it from coming back.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer,
p254
aVI went back to look at cancer's causes.
p255
aVAnd what really intrigued me,
p256
aVwas when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent
p257
aVof environmentally-caused cancers.
p258
aVNow the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet,
p259
aVwhat to strip out, take away.
p260
aVBut I actually took a completely opposite approach,
p261
aVand began asking: What could we be adding to our diet
p262
aVthat's naturally antiangiogenic,
p263
aVand that could boost the body's defense system,
p264
aVand beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?
p265
aVIn other words, can we eat to starve cancer?
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VWell, the answer is yes, and I'm going to show you how.
p270
aVAnd our search for this has taken us to the market,
p271
aVthe farm and to the spice cabinet,
p272
aVbecause what we've discovered
p273
aVis that Mother Nature has laced a large number
p274
aVof foods and beverages and herbs
p275
aVwith naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
p276
aa(lp277
VHere's a test system we developed.
p278
aVAt the center is a ring
p279
aVfrom which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion.
p280
aVAnd we can use this system to test dietary factors
p281
aVat concentrations that are obtainable by eating.
p282
aVLet me show you what happens
p283
aVwhen we put in an extract from red grapes.
p284
aVThe active ingredient is resveratrol,
p285
aVit's also found in red wine.
p286
aVThis inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,
p287
aVby 60 percent.
p288
aVHere's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries.
p289
aVIt potently inhibits angiogenesis.
p290
aVAnd extract from soybeans.
p291
aVAnd here is a growing list
p292
aVof antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying.
p293
aVFor each food type,
p294
aVwe believe that there are different potencies
p295
aVwithin different strains and varietals.
p296
aVAnd we want to measure this because,
p297
aVwell, while you're eating a strawberry
p298
aVor drinking tea,
p299
aVwhy not select the one that's most potent
p300
aVfor preventing cancer?
p301
aa(lp302
VSo here are four different teas that we've tested.
p303
aVThey're all common ones: Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,
p304
aVEarl Grey and a special blend that we prepared,
p305
aVand you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency,
p306
aVfrom less potent to more potent.
p307
aVBut what's very cool
p308
aVis when we combine the two less potent teas together,
p309
aVthe combination, the blend, is more potent than either one alone.
p310
aVThis means there's food synergy.
p311
aa(lp312
VHere's some more data from our testing.
p313
aVNow in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis,
p314
aVrepresented here in a black bar.
p315
aVAnd using this system, we can test the potency of cancer drugs.
p316
aVSo the shorter the bar,
p317
aVthe less angiogenesis \u2014 that's good.
p318
aVAnd here are some common drugs
p319
aVthat have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people.
p320
aVStatins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
p321
aVand a few others \u2014 they inhibit angiogenesis, too.
p322
aVAnd here are the dietary factors
p323
aVgoing head-to-head against these drugs.
p324
aVYou can see they clearly hold their own,
p325
aVand in some cases, they're more potent than the actual drugs.
p326
aVSoy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.
p327
aVI could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients.
p328
aVImagine if we could create the world's first rating system,
p329
aVin which we could score foods
p330
aVaccording to their antiangiogenic, cancer-preventative properties.
p331
aVAnd that's what we're doing right now.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,
p334
aVand so the real question is:
p335
aVWhat is the evidence in people
p336
aVthat eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer?
p337
aVWell, the best example I know
p338
aVis a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years,
p339
aVin which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes
p340
aVtwo to three times a week,
p341
aVhad up to a 50 percent reduction
p342
aVin their risk of developing prostate cancer.
p343
aVNow, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,
p344
aVand lycopene is antiangiogenic.
p345
aVBut what's even more interesting from this study,
p346
aVis that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,
p347
aVthose who ate more servings of tomato sauce,
p348
aVactually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer.
p349
aVSo this human study is a prime example
p350
aVof how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels,
p351
aVcan have an impact on cancer.
p352
aVAnd we're now studying the role of a healthy diet \u2014
p353
aVwith Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University \u2014
p354
aVthe role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis
p355
aVthat we can find in the bloodstream.
p356
aa(lp357
VObviously, what I've shared with you has some far-ranging implications,
p358
aVeven beyond cancer research.
p359
aVBecause if we're right, it could impact consumer education,
p360
aVfood services, public health
p361
aVand even the insurance industry.
p362
aVAnd in fact, some insurance companies
p363
aVare already beginning to think along these lines.
p364
aVCheck out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota.
p365
aVFor many people around the world,
p366
aVdietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution,
p367
aVbecause not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments,
p368
aVbut everybody could benefit from a healthy diet
p369
aVbased on local, sustainable, antiangiogenic crops.
p370
aa(lp371
VNow, finally,
p372
aVI've talked to you about food,
p373
aVand I've talked to you about cancer,
p374
aVso there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about,
p375
aVand that's obesity.
p376
aVBecause it turns out that adipose tissue \u2014 fat \u2014
p377
aVis highly angiogenesis-dependent.
p378
aVAnd like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.
p379
aVSo the question is:
p380
aVCan we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply?
p381
aVThe top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse
p382
aVthat eats nonstop until it turns fat,
p383
aVlike this furry tennis ball.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.
p388
aa(lp389
VIf you take the obese mouse
p390
aVand give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
p391
aVStop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
p392
aVStop the treatment, it gains the weight back.
p393
aVAnd, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down
p394
aVsimply by inhibiting angiogenesis.
p395
aVSo this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention
p396
aVmay also have an application for obesity.
p397
aVThe truly interesting thing about this
p398
aVis that we can't take these obese mice
p399
aVand make them lose more weight
p400
aVthan what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.
p401
aVIn other words, we can't create supermodel mice.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Laughter)
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd this speaks to the role of angiogenesis
p406
aVin regulating healthy set points.
p407
aa(lp408
VAlbert Szent-Györgi once said,
p409
aV"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,
p410
aVand thinking what no one has thought."
p411
aa(lp412
VI hope I've convinced you
p413
aVthat for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,
p414
aVthere may be a great power
p415
aVin attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.
p416
aVAnd that's what I think the world needs now.
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you.
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VJune Cohen: I have a quick question for you.
p423
aa(lp424
VJC: So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now.
p425
aVFor anyone out here who has cancer, what would you recommend?
p426
aVDo you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?
p427
aa(lp428
VWilliam Li: There are antiangiogenic treatments
p429
aVthat are FDA approved,
p430
aVand if you're a cancer patient,
p431
aVor working for one or advocating for one, you should ask about them.
p432
aVAnd there are many clinical trials.
p433
aVThe Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,
p434
aVand there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline.
p435
aVSo, consider the approved ones,
p436
aVlook for clinical trials,
p437
aVbut then between what the doctor can do for you,
p438
aVwe need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.
p439
aVThis is one of the themes I'm talking about:
p440
aVWe can empower ourselves
p441
aVto do the things that doctors can't do for us,
p442
aVwhich is to use knowledge and take action.
p443
aVAnd if Mother Nature has given us some clues,
p444
aVwe think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat,
p445
aVand what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.
p446
aa(lp447
VJC: Right. And along those lines,
