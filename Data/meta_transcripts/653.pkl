VI want to start with a game. Okay?
p4
aVAnd to win this game,
p5
aVall you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you
p6
aVas it really is, all right?
p7
aVSo we have two panels here, of colored dots.
p8
aVAnd one of those dots is the same in the two panels.
p9
aVAnd you have to tell me which one.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, I narrowed it down
p12
aVto the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one.
p13
aVSo by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one.
p14
aVShow of hands: how many people think it's the gray one?
p15
aVReally? Okay.
p16
aVHow many people think it's the green one?
p17
aVAnd how many people think it's the orange one?
p18
aVPretty even split.
p19
aa(lp20
VLet's find out what the reality is.
p21
aVHere is the orange one.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VHere is the green one.
p26
aVAnd here is the gray one.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists.
p31
aVAll right?
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo this is pretty amazing, isn't it?
p36
aVBecause nearly every living system
p37
aVhas evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.
p38
aVSo for us, seeing color
p39
aVis one of the simplest things the brain does.
p40
aVAnd yet, even at this most fundamental level,
p41
aVcontext is everything.
p42
aVWhat I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything,
p43
aVbut why context is everything.
p44
aVBecause it's answering that question
p45
aVthat tells us not only why we see what we do,
p46
aVbut who we are as individuals,
p47
aVand who we are as a society.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut first, we have to ask another question,
p50
aVwhich is, "What is color for?"
p51
aVAnd instead of telling you, I'll just show you.
p52
aVWhat you see here is a jungle scene,
p53
aVand you see the surfaces according to the amount of light
p54
aVthat those surfaces reflect.
p55
aVNow, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?
p56
aVAnd if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?
p61
aVNow let's see the surfaces
p62
aVaccording to the quality of light that they reflect.
p63
aVAnd now you see it.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, color enables us to see
p66
aVthe similarities and differences between surfaces,
p67
aVaccording to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.
p68
aVBut what you've just done
p69
aVis in many respects mathematically impossible.
p70
aVWhy?
p71
aVBecause, as Berkeley tells us,
p72
aVwe have no direct access to our physical world,
p73
aVother than through our senses.
p74
aVAnd the light that falls onto our eyes
p75
aVis determined by multiple things in the world,
p76
aVnot only the color of objects,
p77
aVbut also the color of their illumination,
p78
aVand the color of the space between us and those objects.
p79
aVYou vary any one of those parameters,
p80
aVand you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis is a huge problem,
p83
aVbecause it means that the same image
p84
aVcould have an infinite number of possible real-world sources.
p85
aVLet me show you what I mean.
p86
aVImagine that this is the back of your eye, okay?
p87
aVAnd these are two projections from the world.
p88
aVThey're identical in every single way.
p89
aVIdentical in shape, size, spectral content.
p90
aVThey are the same, as far as your eye is concerned.
p91
aVAnd yet they come from completely different sources.
p92
aVThe one on the right comes from a yellow surface,
p93
aVin shadow, oriented facing the left,
p94
aVviewed through a pinkish medium.
p95
aVThe one on the left comes from an orange surface,
p96
aVunder direct light, facing to the right,
p97
aVviewed through sort of a bluish medium.
p98
aVCompletely different meanings,
p99
aVgiving rise to the exact same retinal information.
p100
aVAnd yet it's only the retinal information that we get.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo how on Earth do we even see?
p103
aVSo if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes,
p104
aVremember this:
p105
aVthat the light that falls onto your eye,
p106
aVsensory information, is meaningless,
p107
aVbecause it could mean literally anything.
p108
aVAnd what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.
p109
aVThere's no inherent meaning in information.
p110
aVIt's what we do with that information that matters.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see.
p113
aVThe brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns,
p114
aVfinding relationships in information,
p115
aVand associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning,
p116
aVa significance, by interacting with the world.
p117
aVWe're very aware of this
p118
aVin the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.
p119
aVI'm going to give you some letter strings,
p120
aVand I want you to read them out for me, if you can.
p121
aa(lp122
VAudience: "Can you read this?"
p123
aV"You are not reading this."
p124
aV"What are you reading?"
p125
aa(lp126
VBeau Lotto: "What are you reading?" Half the letters are missing, right?
p127
aVThere's no a priori reason
p128
aVwhy an "H" has to go between that "W" and "A."
p129
aVBut you put one there. Why?
p130
aVBecause in the statistics of your past experience,
p131
aVit would have been useful to do so.
p132
aVSo you do so again.
p133
aVAnd yet you don't put a letter after that first "T."
p134
aVWhy? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.
p135
aVSo you don't do it again.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality,
p138
aVeven at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.
p139
aVSo if I could have the lights down up here.
p140
aVI want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.
p141
aVOne is simply the flipping of the other.
p142
aVNow I want you to look at that dot
p143
aVbetween the green and the red.
p144
aVAnd I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else.
p145
aVWe're going to look at it for about 30 seconds,
p146
aVwhich is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut I really want you to learn.
p151
aVAnd I'll tell you \u2014 don't look anywhere else \u2014
p152
aVI'll tell you what's happening in your head.
p153
aVYour brain is learning,
p154
aVand it's learning that the right side of its visual field
p155
aVis under red illumination;
p156
aVthe left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
p157
aVThat's what it's learning. Okay?
p158
aVNow, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.
p159
aVSo why don't you do that now?
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VCan I have the lights up again?
p164
aa(lp165
VI take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VWhy? Because your brain is seeing that same information
p170
aVas if the right one is still under red light,
p171
aVand the left one is still under green light.
p172
aVThat's your new normal.
p173
aVOkay? So, what does this mean for context?
p174
aVIt means I can take two identical squares,
p175
aVput them in light and dark surrounds,
p176
aVand the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround.
p177
aVWhat's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter.
p178
aVIt's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo I'll show you what I mean.
p181
aVHere we have that exact same illusion.
p182
aVWe have two identical tiles on the left,
p183
aVone in a dark surround, one in a light surround.
p184
aVAnd the same thing over on the right.
p185
aVNow, I'll reveal those two scenes,
p186
aVbut I'm not going to change anything within those boxes,
p187
aVexcept their meaning.
p188
aVAnd see what happens to your perception.
p189
aa(lp190
VNotice that on the left
p191
aVthe two tiles look nearly completely opposite:
p192
aVone very white and one very dark, right?
p193
aVWhereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.
p194
aVAnd yet there is still one on a dark surround,
p195
aVand one on a light surround.
p196
aVWhy?
p197
aVBecause if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow,
p198
aVand reflecting the same amount of light to your eye
p199
aVas the one outside the shadow,
p200
aVit would have to be more reflective \u2014 just the laws of physics.
p201
aVSo you see it that way.
p202
aa(lp203
VWhereas on the right, the information is consistent
p204
aVwith those two tiles being under the same light.
p205
aVIf they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye,
p206
aVthen they must be equally reflective.
p207
aVSo you see it that way.
p208
aVWhich means we can bring all this information together
p209
aVto create some incredibly strong illusions.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is one I made a few years ago.
p212
aVAnd you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top,
p213
aVand a bright orange tile at the side.
p214
aVThat is your perceptual reality.
p215
aVThe physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.
p216
aa(lp217
VHere you see four gray tiles on your left,
p218
aVseven gray tiles on the right.
p219
aVI'm not going to change those tiles at all,
p220
aVbut I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene.
p221
aVAnd see what happens to your perception.
p222
aVThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.
p223
aVThe seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.
p224
aVThey are the same. Okay?
p225
aVDon't believe me? Let's watch it again.
p226
aa(lp227
VWhat's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.
p228
aVSo, here we have \u2014
p229
aVlet's turn this around \u2014 a diamond.
p230
aVAnd what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here,
p231
aVand I'm going to spin it.
p232
aVAnd for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.
p233
aVNow I want you to keep looking at it.
p234
aVMove your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.
p235
aVAnd suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
p236
aVYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
p237
aVKeep blinking.
p238
aVEvery time you blink, it will switch.
p239
aVSo I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?
p240
aVHow do you know?
p241
aVYour brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely.
p242
aVSo depending on where it looks,
p243
aVit flips between the two possibilities.
p244
aa(lp245
VAre we the only ones that see illusions?
p246
aVThe answer to this question is no.
p247
aVEven the beautiful bumblebee,
p248
aVwith its mere one million brain cells,
p249
aVwhich is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina,
p250
aVsees illusions, does the most complicated things
p251
aVthat even our most sophisticated computers can't do.
p252
aVSo in my lab we work on bumblebees,
p253
aVbecause we can completely control their experience,
p254
aVand see how it alters the architecture of their brain.
p255
aVWe do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.
p256
aa(lp257
VHere you have the hive.
p258
aVYou can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle.
p259
aVThose are her daughters, the eggs.
p260
aVThey go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube.
p261
aVYou'll see one of the bees come out here.
p262
aVYou see how she has a little number on her?
p263
aVThere's another one coming out, she also has a number on her.
p264
aVNow, they're not born that way, right?
p265
aVWe pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep.
p266
aVThen you can superglue little numbers on them.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers.
p271
aVThey land on the flower,
p272
aVstick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.
p273
aVShe's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I,
p274
aVwill do that about three times, then fly.
p275
aVAnd sometimes they learn not to go to the blue,
p276
aVbut to go where the other bees go.
p277
aVSo they copy each other.
p278
aVThey can count to five. They can recognize faces.
p279
aVAnd here she comes down the ladder.
p280
aVAnd she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot,
p281
aVand throw up, and that's honey.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VNow remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers,
p286
aVbut what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?
p287
aVIt looks like they're going to green flowers.
p288
aVNow, are they getting it wrong?
p289
aVAnd the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers.
p290
aVBut those are blue flowers under green light.
p291
aVSo they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle,
p292
aVwhich is exactly what we do.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, illusions are often used,
p295
aVespecially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist,
p296
aV"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses."
p297
aVOkay, this is complete rubbish.
p298
aVThe senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
p299
aVInstead, color tells us something completely different,
p300
aVthat the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
p301
aVWe can't.
p302
aVInstead, the brain evolved to see the world
p303
aVthe way it was useful to see in the past.
p304
aVAnd how we see is by continually redefining normality.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain
p307
aVand get people to experience their world differently?
p308
aVWell, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio
p309
aVis we translate the light into sound,
p310
aVand we enable people to hear their visual world.
p311
aVAnd they can navigate the world using their ears.
p312
aa(lp313
VHere's David on the right, and he's holding a camera.
p314
aVOn the left is what his camera sees.
p315
aVAnd you'll see there's a faint line going across that image.
p316
aVThat line is broken up into 32 squares.
p317
aVIn each square, we calculate the average color.
p318
aVAnd then we just simply translate that into sound.
p319
aVAnd now he's going to turn around,
p320
aVclose his eyes,
p321
aVand find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.
p322
aa(lp323

V(Sound changes momentarily)

aa(lp329

aa(lp331

p332
aa(lp333
V(Sound changes momentarily)
p334
aa(lp335
VBeau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?
p336
aVSo not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired,
p337
aVbut we can also investigate
p338
aVhow people literally make sense of the world.
p339
aVBut we can also do something else.
p340
aVWe can also make music with color.
p341
aVSo, working with kids,
p342
aVthey created images,
p343
aVthinking about what might the images you see
p344
aVsound like if we could listen to them.
p345
aVAnd then we translated these images.
p346
aVAnd this is one of those images.
p347
aVAnd this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music
p348
aVfor a 32-piece orchestra.
p349
aVAnd this is what it sounds like.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Electronic representation of orchestral music)
p352
aa(lp353
VSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, what does all this mean?
p356
aVWhat this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay?
p357
aVWe're not defined by our central properties,
p358
aVby the bits that make us up.
p359
aVWe're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment,
p360
aVby our ecology.
p361
aVAnd that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical.
p362
aVSo, what I'd like to finish with is this over here.
p363
aVBecause what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty.
p364
aVBecause I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain,
p367
aVI'd like to do this one.
p368
aVSo, if we have the lights down.
p369
aVAnd what we have here \u2014
p370
aVCan everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left,
p371
aVand 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?
p372
aVSo now, what I want to do,
p373
aVI'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here
p374
aVunder yellow illumination,
p375
aVby simply putting a filter behind them.
p376
aVNow you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right?
p377
aVBecause now the light is going through a yellowish filter
p378
aVand then a purplish filter.
p379
aVI'm going to do the opposite on the left here.
p380
aVI'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.
p381
aa(lp382
VNow, some of you will have noticed that the consequence
p383
aVis that the light coming through those middle nine on the right,
p384
aVor your left, is exactly the same as the light
p385
aVcoming through the middle nine on your right.
p386
aVAgreed? Yes?
p387
aVOkay. So they are physically the same.
p388
aVLet's pull the covers off.
p389
aVNow remember \u2014
p390
aVyou know that the middle nine are exactly the same.
p391
aVDo they look the same?
p392
aVNo.
p393
aVThe question is, "Is that an illusion?"
p394
aVAnd I'll leave you with that.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, thank you very much.
