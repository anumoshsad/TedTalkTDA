VSeveral years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman
p4
aVintroduced a design challenge
p5
aVcalled the marshmallow challenge.
p6
aVAnd the idea's pretty simple:
p7
aVTeams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure
p8
aVout of 20 sticks of spaghetti,
p9
aVone yard of tape, one yard of string
p10
aVand a marshmallow.
p11
aVThe marshmallow has to be on top.
p12
aVAnd, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard
p13
aVbecause it forces people
p14
aVto collaborate very quickly.
p15
aVAnd so, I thought this was an interesting idea,
p16
aVand I incorporated it into a design workshop.
p17
aVAnd it was a huge success.
p18
aVAnd since then, I've conducted
p19
aVabout 70 design workshops across the world
p20
aVwith students and designers and architects,
p21
aVeven the CTOs of the Fortune 50,
p22
aVand there's something about this exercise
p23
aVthat reveals very deep lessons
p24
aVabout the nature of collaboration,
p25
aVand I'd like to share some of them with you.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, normally, most people begin
p28
aVby orienting themselves to the task.
p29
aVThey talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,
p30
aVthey jockey for power.
p31
aVThen they spend some time planning, organizing,
p32
aVthey sketch and they lay out spaghetti.
p33
aVThey spend the majority of their time
p34
aVassembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.
p35
aVAnd then finally, just as they're running out of time,
p36
aVsomeone takes out the marshmallow,
p37
aVand then they gingerly put it on top,
p38
aVand then they stand back, and \u2014 ta-da! \u2014
p39
aVthey admire their work.
p40
aVBut what really happens, most of the time,
p41
aVis that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"
p42
aVbecause the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure
p43
aVto buckle and to collapse.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo there are a number of people
p46
aVwho have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,
p47
aVand among the worst are recent graduates of business school.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVThey lie, they cheat, they get distracted
p50
aVand they produce really lame structures.
p51
aVAnd of course there are teams
p52
aVthat have a lot more "ta-da" structures,
p53
aVand among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVAnd it's pretty amazing.
p56
aVAs Peter tells us,
p57
aVnot only do they produce the tallest structures,
p58
aVbut they're the most interesting structures of them all.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo the question you want to ask is:
p61
aVHow come? Why? What is it about them?
p62
aVAnd Peter likes to say that
p63
aVnone of the kids spend any time
p64
aVtrying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
p65
aVThey don't spend time jockeying for power.
p66
aVBut there's another reason as well.
p67
aVAnd the reason is that business students are trained
p68
aVto find the single right plan, right?
p69
aVAnd then they execute on it.
p70
aVAnd then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,
p71
aVthey run out of time and what happens?
p72
aVIt's a crisis.
p73
aVSound familiar? Right.
p74
aVWhat kindergarteners do differently
p75
aVis that they start with the marshmallow,
p76
aVand they build prototypes, successive prototypes,
p77
aValways keeping the marshmallow on top,
p78
aVso they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.
p79
aVDesigners recognize this type of collaboration
p80
aVas the essence of the iterative process.
p81
aVAnd with each version, kids get instant feedback
p82
aVabout what works and what doesn't work.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,
p85
aVbut let's look at how different teams perform.
p86
aVSo the average for most people is around 20 inches;
p87
aVbusiness schools students, about half of that;
p88
aVlawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,
p89
aVkindergarteners, better than most adults.
p90
aVWho does the very best?
p91
aVArchitects and engineers, thankfully.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVThirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.
p94
aVAnd why is it? Because they understand triangles
p95
aVand self-reinforcing geometrical patterns
p96
aVare the key to building
p97
aVstable structures.
p98
aVSo CEOs, a little bit better than average,
p99
aVbut here's where it gets interesting.
p100
aVIf you put you put an executive admin. on the team,
p101
aVthey get significantly better.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVIt's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."
p104
aVYou can just tell beforehand. And why is that?
p105
aVBecause they have special skills
p106
aVof facilitation.
p107
aVThey manage the process, they understand the process.
p108
aVAnd any team who manages
p109
aVand pays close attention to work
p110
aVwill significantly improve the team's performance.
p111
aVSpecialized skills and facilitation skills
p112
aVare the combination that leads to strong success.
p113
aVIf you have 10 teams that typically perform,
p114
aVyou'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd I tried something interesting.
p117
aVI thought, let's up the ante, once.
p118
aVSo I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.
p119
aVSo what do you think happened to these design students?
p120
aVWhat was the result?
p121
aVHere's what happened:
p122
aVNot one team had a standing structure.
p123
aVIf anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,
p124
aVthey would have taken home the prize.
p125
aVSo, isn't that interesting? That high stakes
p126
aVhave a strong impact.
p127
aVWe did the exercise again with the same students.
p128
aVWhat do you think happened then?
p129
aVSo now they understand the value of prototyping.
p130
aVSo the same team went from being the very worst
p131
aVto being among the very best.
p132
aVThey produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.
p133
aVSo there's deep lessons for us
p134
aVabout the nature of incentives and success.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, you might ask: Why would anyone
p137
aVactually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?
p138
aVAnd the reason is, I help create
p139
aVdigital tools and processes
p140
aVto help teams build cars and video games
p141
aVand visual effects.
p142
aVAnd what the marshmallow challenge does
p143
aVis it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.
p144
aVBecause, frankly,
p145
aVevery project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?
p146
aVThe challenge provides a shared experience,
p147
aVa common language,
p148
aVa common stance to build the right prototype.
p149
aVAnd so, this is the value of the experience,
p150
aVof this so simple exercise.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd those of you who are interested
p153
aVmay want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
p154
aVIt's a blog that you can look at
p155
aVhow to build the marshmallows.
p156
aVThere's step-by-step instructions on this.
p157
aVThere are crazy examples from around the world
p158
aVof how people tweak and adjust the system.
p159
aVThere's world records that are on this as well.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd the fundamental lesson, I believe,
p162
aVis that design truly is
p163
aVa contact sport.
p164
aVIt demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,
p165
aVand that we apply the very best of our thinking,
p166
aVour feeling and our doing
p167
aVto the challenge that we have at hand.
p168
aVAnd sometimes, a little prototype of this experience
p169
aVis all that it takes to turn us
p170
aVfrom an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.
p171
aVAnd that can make a big difference.
p172
