VI'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft.
p4
aVTo escort and land the probe on a comet,
p5
aVthis has been my passion for the past two years.
p6
aVIn order to do that,
p7
aVI need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen we go back four and a half billion years,
p10
aVthere was a cloud of gas and dust.
p11
aVIn the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited.
p12
aVAlong with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed.
p13
aVWhat then happened, according to theory,
p14
aVis that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation,
p15
aVcomets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth.
p16
aVThey probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth,
p17
aVand that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life.
p18
aVYou can compare this to having to solve a 250-piece puzzle
p19
aVand not a 2,000-piece puzzle.
p20
aa(lp21
VAfterwards, the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn,
p22
aVthey were not in their place where they are now,
p23
aVand they interacted gravitationally,
p24
aVand they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean,
p25
aVand what we now know as comets
p26
aVended up in something called the Kuiper Belt,
p27
aVwhich is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune.
p28
aVAnd sometimes these objects run into each other,
p29
aVand they gravitationally deflect,
p30
aVand then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system.
p31
aVAnd they then become the comets as we see them in the sky.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe important thing here to note is that in the meantime,
p34
aVthe four and a half billion years,
p35
aVthese comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system,
p36
aVand haven't changed \u2014
p37
aVdeep, frozen versions of our solar system.
p38
aa(lp39
VIn the sky, they look like this.
p40
aVWe know them for their tails.
p41
aVThere are actually two tails.
p42
aVOne is a dust tail, which is blown away by the solar wind.
p43
aVThe other one is an ion tail, which is charged particles,
p44
aVand they follow the magnetic field in the solar system.
p45
aVThere's the coma,
p46
aVand then there is the nucleus, which here is too small to see,
p47
aVand you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta,
p48
aVthe spacecraft is in that center pixel.
p49
aVWe are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers away from the comet.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo what's important to remember?
p52
aVComets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed,
p53
aVso they're ideal to study the components
p54
aVthat were present at the time  when Earth, and life, started.
p55
aVComets are also suspected
p56
aVof having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life.
p57
aVIn 1983, ESA set up its long-term Horizon 2000 program,
p58
aVwhich contained one cornerstone, which would be a mission to a comet.
p59
aVIn parallel, a small mission to a comet, what you see here, Giotto, was launched,
p60
aVand in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft.
p61
aVFrom the results of that mission, it became immediately clear
p62
aVthat comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system.
p63
aVAnd thus, the Rosetta mission was approved in 1993,
p64
aVand originally it was supposed to be launched in 2003,
p65
aVbut a problem arose with an Ariane rocket.
p66
aVHowever, our P.R. department, in its enthusiasm,
p67
aVhad already made 1,000 Delft Blue plates
p68
aVwith the name of the wrong comets.
p69
aVSo I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VOnce the whole problem was solved,
p73
aVwe left Earth in 2004
p74
aVto the newly selected comet, Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
p75
aVThis comet had to be specially selected
p76
aVbecause A, you have to be able to get to it,
p77
aVand B, it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long.
p78
aVThis particular comet has been  in the solar system since 1959.
p79
aVThat's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter,
p80
aVand it got close enough to the sun to start changing.
p81
aVSo it's a very fresh comet.
p82
aa(lp83
VRosetta made a few historic firsts.
p84
aVIt's the first satellite to orbit a comet,
p85
aVand to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system \u2014
p86
aVclosest approach to the sun, as we will see in August,
p87
aVand then away again to the exterior.
p88
aVIt's the first ever landing on a comet.
p89
aVWe actually orbit the comet using something which is not
p90
aVnormally done with spacecraft.
p91
aVNormally, you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are.
p92
aVIn this case, that's not enough.
p93
aVWe navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet.
p94
aVWe recognized features \u2014 boulders, craters \u2014
p95
aVand that's how we know where we are respective to the comet.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd, of course, it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter
p98
aVon solar cells.
p99
aVNow, this sounds more heroic than it actually is,
p100
aVbecause the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators
p101
aVwasn't available in Europe at that time, so there was no choice.
p102
aVBut these solar arrays are big.
p103
aVThis is one wing, and these are not specially selected small people.
p104
aVThey're just like you and me.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVWe have two of these wings, 65 square meters.
p107
aVNow later on, of course, when we got to the comet,
p108
aVyou find out that 65 square meters of sail
p109
aVclose to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, how did we get to the comet?
p112
aVBecause we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives
p113
aVvery far away \u2014 four times the distance of the Earth to the sun \u2014
p114
aVand also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel,
p115
aVbecause we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.
p116
aVSo what do you do?
p117
aVYou use gravitational flybys, slingshots,
p118
aVwhere you pass by a planet at very low altitude,
p119
aVa few thousand kilometers,
p120
aVand then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free.
p121
aVWe did that a few times.
p122
aVWe did Earth, we did Mars, we did twice Earth again,
p123
aVand we also flew by two asteroids, Lutetia and Steins.
p124
aVThen in 2011, we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble,
p125
aVwe couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore,
p126
aVso we went into hibernation.
p127
aVEverything was switched off except for one clock.
p128
aVHere you see in white the trajectory, and the way this works.
p129
aVYou see that from the circle where we started,
p130
aVthe white line, actually you get more and more and more elliptical,
p131
aVand then finally we approached the comet
p132
aVin May 2014, and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers.
p133
aa(lp134
VOn the way there, we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras.
p135
aVThis is the moon rising over Earth,
p136
aVand this is what we now call a selfie,
p137
aVwhich at that time, by the way, that word didn't exist. (Laughter)
p138
aVIt's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera.
p139
aVThat's one of the cameras on the lander,
p140
aVand it just looks under the solar arrays,
p141
aVand you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, when we got out of hibernation in January 2014,
p144
aVwe started arriving at a distance
p145
aVof two million kilometers from the comet in May.
p146
aVHowever, the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast.
p147
aVWe were going 2,800 kilometers an hour faster than the comet, so we had to brake.
p148
aVWe had to do eight maneuvers,
p149
aVand you see here, some of them were really big.
p150
aVWe had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour,
p151
aVand actually, the duration of that was seven hours,
p152
aVand it used 218 kilos of fuel,
p153
aVand those were seven nerve-wracking  hours, because in 2007,
p154
aVthere was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta,
p155
aVand we had to close off a branch,
p156
aVso the system was actually operating at a pressure
p157
aVwhich it was never designed or qualified for.
p158
aa(lp159
VThen we got in the vicinity of the comet, and these were the first pictures we saw.
p160
aVThe true comet rotation period is 12 and a half hours,
p161
aVso this is accelerated,
p162
aVbut you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought,
p163
aVthis is not going to be an easy thing to land on.
p164
aVWe had hoped for some kind of spud-like thing
p165
aVwhere you could easily land.
p166
aVBut we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.
p167
aVNo. That didn't work either. (Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VSo at that point in time, it was clearly unavoidable:
p170
aVwe had to map this body in all the detail you could get,
p171
aVbecause we had to find an area which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.
p172
aVWhy 500 meters? That's the error we have on landing the probe.
p173
aVSo we went through this process, and we mapped the comet.
p174
aVWe used a technique called photoclinometry.
p175
aVYou use shadows thrown by the sun.
p176
aVWhat you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet,
p177
aVand the sun shines from above.
p178
aVFrom the shadow, we, with our brain,
p179
aVcan immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is.
p180
aVYou can program that in a computer,
p181
aVyou then cover the whole comet, and you can map the comet.
p182
aVFor that, we flew special trajectories starting in August.
p183
aVFirst, a triangle of 100 kilometers on a side
p184
aVat 100 kilometers' distance,
p185
aVand we repeated the whole  thing at 50 kilometers.
p186
aVAt that time, we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles,
p187
aVand we could use this technique to map the whole thing.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, this led to a selection of landing sites.
p190
aVThis whole process we had to do, to go from the mapping of the comet
p191
aVto actually finding the final landing site, was 60 days.
p192
aVWe didn't have more.
p193
aVTo give you an idea, the average Mars mission
p194
aVtakes hundreds of scientists for years to meet
p195
aVabout where shall we go?
p196
aVWe had 60 days, and that was it.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe finally selected the final landing site
p199
aVand the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae.
p200
aVThe way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space,
p201
aVand aiming towards the comet, because the lander is passive.
p202
aVThe lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet.
p203
aVRosetta had to turn around
p204
aVto get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing
p205
aVand to be able to communicate with it.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours.
p208
aVNow do a simple calculation:
p209
aVif the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second,
p210
aVseven hours is 25,000 seconds.
p211
aVThat means 252 meters wrong on the comet.
p212
aVSo we had to know the velocity of Rosetta
p213
aVmuch better than one centimeter per second,
p214
aVand its location in space better than 100 meters
p215
aVat 500 million kilometers from Earth.
p216
aVThat's no mean feat.
p217
aa(lp218
VLet me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments.
p219
aVI won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments,
p220
aVbut it's got everything.
p221
aVWe can sniff gas, we can measure dust particles,
p222
aVthe shape of them, the composition,
p223
aVthere are magnetometers, everything.
p224
aVThis is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density
p225
aVat the position of Rosetta,
p226
aVso it's gas which has left the comet.
p227
aVThe bottom graph is September of last year.
p228
aVThere is a long-term variation, which in itself is not surprising,
p229
aVbut you see the sharp peaks.
p230
aVThis is a comet day.
p231
aVYou can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas
p232
aVand the fact that the comet is rotating.
p233
aVSo there is one spot, apparently,
p234
aVwhere there is a lot of stuff coming from,
p235
aVit gets heated in the Sun, and then cools down on the back side.
p236
aVAnd we can see the density variations of this.
p237
aa(lp238
VThese are the gases and the organic compounds
p239
aVthat we already have measured.
p240
aVYou will see it's an impressive list,
p241
aVand there is much, much, much more to come,
p242
aVbecause there are more measurements.
p243
aVActually, there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment
p244
aVwhere many of these results are presented.
p245
aa(lp246
VAlso, we measured dust particles.
p247
aVNow, for you, this will not look very impressive,
p248
aVbut the scientists were thrilled when they saw this.
p249
aVTwo dust particles:
p250
aVthe right one they call Boris, and they shot it with tantalum
p251
aVin order to be able to analyze it.
p252
aVNow, we found sodium and magnesium.
p253
aVWhat this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials
p254
aVat the time the solar system was formed,
p255
aVso we learned things about which materials were there
p256
aVwhen the planet was made.
p257
aa(lp258
VOf course, one of the important elements is the imaging.
p259
aVThis is one of the cameras of Rosetta, the OSIRIS camera,
p260
aVand this actually was the cover of Science magazine
p261
aVon January 23 of this year.
p262
aVNobody had expected this body to look like this.
p263
aVBoulders, rocks \u2014 if anything, it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite
p264
aVthan anything else.
p265
aVWe also saw things like this:
p266
aVdunes, and what look to be, on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.
p267
aVNow we know these from Mars, but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,
p268
aVso it's a bit difficult to create a wind-blown shadow.
p269
aVIt may be local outgassing,
p270
aVstuff which goes up and comes back.
p271
aVWe don't know, so there is a lot to investigate.
p272
aVHere, you see the same image twice.
p273
aVOn the left-hand side, you see in the middle a pit.
p274
aVOn the right-hand side, if you carefully look,
p275
aVthere are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit.
p276
aVSo this is the activity of the comet.
p277
aVApparently, at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are,
p278
aVand where the material evaporates into space.
p279
aVThere is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet.
p280
aVYou see it on the right-hand side.
p281
aVIt's a kilometer long, and it's two and a half meters wide.
p282
aVSome people suggest that actually,
p283
aVwhen we get close to the sun,
p284
aVthe comet may split in two,
p285
aVand then we'll have to choose,
p286
aVwhich comet do we go for?
p287
aVThe lander \u2014 again, lots of instruments,
p288
aVmostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.
p289
aVBut much the same as Rosetta, and that is because you want to compare
p290
aVwhat you find in space with what you find on the comet.
p291
aVThese are called ground truth measurements.
p292
aa(lp293
VThese are the landing descent images
p294
aVthat were taken by the OSIRIS camera.
p295
aVYou see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta.
p296
aVOn the top right, you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander,
p297
aV60 meters above the surface of the comet.
p298
aVThe boulder there is some 10 meters.
p299
aVSo this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet.
p300
aVHere, you see the whole sequence again, but from a different perspective,
p301
aVand you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle
p302
aVof the lander traveling over the surface of the comet.
p303
aVThen, at the top, there is a before and an after image of the landing.
p304
aVThe only problem with the after image is, there is no lander.
p305
aVBut if you carefully look at the right-hand side of this image,
p306
aVwe saw the lander still there,  but it had bounced.
p307
aVIt had departed again.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, on a bit of a comical note here
p310
aVis that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce.
p311
aVThat was discarded because it was way too expensive.
p312
aVNow, we forgot, but the lander knew.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVDuring the first bounce, in the magnetometers,
p315
aVyou see here the data from them, from the three axes, x, y and z.
p316
aVHalfway through, you see a red line.
p317
aVAt that red line, there is a change.
p318
aVWhat happened, apparently, is during the first bounce,
p319
aVsomewhere, we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander,
p320
aVand the rotation velocity of the lander changed.
p321
aVSo we've been rather lucky
p322
aVthat we are where we are.
p323
aa(lp324
VThis is one of the iconic images of Rosetta.
p325
aVIt's a man-made object, a leg of the lander,
p326
aVstanding on a comet.
p327
aVThis, for me, is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VOne of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander.
p332
aVThe blue area here is where we know it must be.
p333
aVWe haven't been able to find it yet, but the search is continuing,
p334
aVas are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again.
p335
aVWe listen every day,
p336
aVand we hope that between now and somewhere in April,
p337
aVthe lander will wake up again.
p338
aa(lp339
VThe findings of what we found on the comet:
p340
aVThis thing would float in water.
p341
aVIt's half the density of water.
p342
aVSo it looks like a very big rock, but it's not.
p343
aVThe activity increase we saw in June, July, August last year
p344
aVwas a four-fold activity increase.
p345
aVBy the time we will be at the sun,
p346
aVthere will be 100 kilos a second leaving this comet:
p347
aVgas, dust, whatever.
p348
aVThat's 100 million kilos a day.
p349
aa(lp350
VThen, finally, the landing day.
p351
aVI will never forget \u2014 absolute madness, 250 TV crews in Germany.
p352
aVThe BBC was interviewing me,
p353
aVand another TV crew who was following me all day
p354
aVwere filming me being interviewed,
p355
aVand it went on like that for the whole day.
p356
aVThe Discovery Channel crew
p357
aVactually caught me when leaving the control room,
p358
aVand they asked the right question,
p359
aVand man, I got into tears, and I still feel this.
p360
aVFor a month and a half,
p361
aVI couldn't think about landing day without crying,
p362
aVand I still have the emotion in me.
p363
aa(lp364
VWith this image of the comet, I would like to leave you.
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you.
