VSo imagine, you're in the supermarket,
p4
aVyou're buying some groceries,
p5
aVand you get given the option
p6
aVfor a plastic or a paper shopping bag.
p7
aVWhich one do you choose if you want to do
p8
aVthe right thing by the environment?
p9
aa(lp10
VMost people do pick the paper.
p11
aVOkay, let's think of why.
p12
aVIt's brown to start with.
p13
aVTherefore, it must be good for the environment.
p14
aVIt's biodegradable. It's reusable.
p15
aVIn some cases, it's recyclable.
p16
aVSo when people are looking at the plastic bag,
p17
aVit's likely they're thinking of something like this,
p18
aVwhich we all know is absolutely terrible,
p19
aVand we should be avoiding at all expenses
p20
aVthese kinds of environmental damages.
p21
aVBut people are often not thinking
p22
aVof something like this,
p23
aVwhich is the other end of the spectrum.
p24
aVWhen we produce materials,
p25
aVwe need to extract them from the environment,
p26
aVand we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts.
p27
aa(lp28
VYou see, what happens is, when we need
p29
aVto make complex choices,
p30
aVus humans like really simple solutions,
p31
aVand so we often ask for simple solutions.
p32
aVAnd I work in design.
p33
aVI advise designers
p34
aVand innovators around sustainability,
p35
aVand everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,
p36
aVI just want the eco-materials."
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I say, "Well, that's very complex,
p39
aVand we'll have to spend four hours talking about
p40
aVwhat exactly an eco-material means,
p41
aVbecause everything at some point
p42
aVcomes from nature,
p43
aVand it's how you use the material
p44
aVthat dictates the environmental impact.
p45
aVSo what happens is, we have to rely
p46
aVon some sort of intuitive framework
p47
aVwhen we make decisions.
p48
aVSo I like to call that intuitive framework
p49
aVour environmental folklore.
p50
aVIt's either the little voice at the back of your head,
p51
aVor it's that gut feeling you get
p52
aVwhen you've done the right thing,
p53
aVso when you've picked the paper bag
p54
aVor when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.
p55
aVAnd environmental folklore is a really important thing
p56
aVbecause we're trying to do the right thing.
p57
aVBut how do we know if we're actually
p58
aVreducing the net environmental impacts
p59
aVthat our actions as individuals and as professionals
p60
aVand as a society are actually having
p61
aVon the natural environment?
p62
aa(lp63
VSo the thing about environmental folklore is
p64
aVit tends to be based on our experiences,
p65
aVthe things we've heard from other people.
p66
aVIt doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework.
p67
aVAnd this is really hard, because we live
p68
aVin incredibly complex systems.
p69
aVWe have the human systems
p70
aVof how we communicate and interrelate
p71
aVand have our whole constructed society,
p72
aVWe have the industrial systems, which is essentially the entire economy,
p73
aVand then all of that has to operate
p74
aVwithin the biggest system,
p75
aVand, I would argue, the most important,
p76
aVthe ecosystem.
p77
aVAnd you see, the choices that we make
p78
aVas an individual,
p79
aVbut the choices that we make
p80
aVin every single job that we have,
p81
aVno matter how high or low you are in the pecking order,
p82
aVhas an impact on all of these systems.
p83
aVAnd the thing is that we have to find ways
p84
aVif we're actually going to address sustainability
p85
aVof interlocking those complex systems
p86
aVand making better choices that result
p87
aVin net environmental gains.
p88
aVWhat we need to do is we need to learn
p89
aVto do more with less.
p90
aVWe have an increasing population,
p91
aVand everybody likes their mobile phones,
p92
aVespecially in this situation here.
p93
aVSo we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd that's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in.
p96
aVSo essentially, everything that is created
p97
aVgoes through a series of life cycle stages,
p98
aVand we use this scientific process
p99
aVcalled life cycle assessment,
p100
aVor in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,
p101
aVin order to have a clearer picture of how
p102
aVeverything that we do in the technical part of those systems
p103
aVaffects the natural environment.
p104
aVSo we go all the way back
p105
aVto the extraction of raw materials,
p106
aVand then we look at manufacturing,
p107
aVwe look at packaging and transportation,
p108
aVuse, and end of life,
p109
aVand at every single one of these stages,
p110
aVthe things that we do
p111
aVhave an interaction with the natural environment,
p112
aVand we can monitor how that interaction
p113
aVis actually affecting the systems and services
p114
aVthat make life on Earth possible.
p115
aVAnd through doing this,
p116
aVwe've learned some absolutely fascinating things.
p117
aVAnd we've busted a bunch of myths.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.
p120
aVIt's used a lot in marketing,
p121
aVand it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation
p122
aVwhen we're talking about sustainability,
p123
aVand that's the word biodegradability.
p124
aVNow biodegradability is a material property;
p125
aVit is not a definition of environmental benefits.
p126
aVAllow me to explain.
p127
aVWhen something natural,
p128
aVsomething that's made from a cellulose fiber
p129
aVlike a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,
p130
aVor even a piece of paper,
p131
aVwhen something natural ends up
p132
aVin the natural environment, it degrades normally.
p133
aVIts little carbon molecules that it stored up
p134
aVas it was growing are naturally released
p135
aVback into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,
p136
aVbut this is a net situation.
p137
aVMost natural things
p138
aVdon't actually end up in nature.
p139
aVMost of the things, the waste that  we produce, end up in landfill.
p140
aVLandfill is a different environment.
p141
aVIn landfill, those same carbon molecules
p142
aVdegrade in a different way,
p143
aVbecause a landfill is anaerobic.
p144
aVIt's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.
p145
aVThose same molecules, they become methane,
p146
aVand methane is a 25 times more potent
p147
aVgreenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
p148
aVSo our old lettuces and products
p149
aVthat we have thrown out that are made
p150
aVout of biodegradable materials,
p151
aVif they end up in landfill,
p152
aVcontribute to climate change.
p153
aVYou see, there are facilities now
p154
aVthat can actually capture that methane
p155
aVand generate power,
p156
aVdisplacing the need for fossil fuel power,
p157
aVbut we need to be smart about this.
p158
aVWe need to identify how we can start to leverage
p159
aVthese types of things that are already happening
p160
aVand start to design systems and services
p161
aVthat alleviate these problems.
p162
aVBecause right now, what people do is they turn around and they say,
p163
aV"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper
p164
aVbecause that is better for the environment."
p165
aVBut if you're throwing it in the bin,
p166
aVand your local landfill facility
p167
aVis just a normal one,
p168
aVthen we're having what's called a double negative.
p169
aa(lp170
VI'm a product designer by trade.
p171
aVI then did social science.
p172
aVAnd so I'm absolutely fascinated
p173
aVby consumer goods and how the consumer goods
p174
aVthat we have kind of become immune to
p175
aVthat fill our lives
p176
aVhave an impact on the natural environment.
p177
aVAnd these guys are, like, serial offenders,
p178
aVand I'm pretty sure everyone in this room
p179
aVhas a refrigerator.
p180
aVNow America has this amazing ability
p181
aVto keep growing refrigerators.
p182
aVIn the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot
p183
aVon average, the standard size
p184
aVof a refrigerator.
p185
aVAnd the problem is, they're so big now,
p186
aVit's easier for us to buy more food
p187
aVthat we can't eat or find.
p188
aVI mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator
p189
aVthat have been there for years, all right?
p190
aVAnd so what happens is, we waste more food.
p191
aVAnd as I was just explaining, food waste is a problem.
p192
aVIn fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent
p193
aVof food purchased for the home is wasted.
p194
aVHalf of the world's produced food is wasted.
p195
aVThat's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.
p196
aVIt's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.
p197
aVAnd I blame it on the refrigerator,
p198
aVwell, especially in Western cultures,
p199
aVbecause it makes it easier.
p200
aVI mean, there's a lot of complex systems going on here.
p201
aVI don't want to make it so simplistic.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,
p204
aVand one of the features of it
p205
aVis the crisper drawer.
p206
aVYou all got crisper drawers?
p207
aVThe drawer that you put your lettuces in?
p208
aVLettuces have a habit of going soggy
p209
aVin the crisper drawers, don't they?
p210
aVYeah? Soggy lettuces?
p211
aVIn the U.K., this is such a problem
p212
aVthat there was a government report a few years ago
p213
aVthat actually said the second biggest offender
p214
aVof wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.
p215
aVIt was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.
p216
aVOkay? So this is a problem, people.
p217
aVThese poor little lettuces are getting thrown out
p218
aVleft, right and center because the crisper drawers
p219
aVare not designed to actually keep things crisp.
p220
aVOkay. You need a tight environment.
p221
aVYou need, like, an airless environment
p222
aVto prevent the degrading that would happen naturally.
p223
aVBut the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer
p224
aVwith a slightly better seal.
p225
aVAnyway, I'm clearly obsessed.
p226
aVDon't ever invite me over because I'll just start going through your refrigerator
p227
aVand looking at all sorts of things like that.
p228
aVBut essentially, this is a big problem.
p229
aVBecause when we lose something like the lettuce from the system,
p230
aVnot only do we have that impact  I just explained at the end of life,
p231
aVbut we actually have had to grow that lettuce.
p232
aVThe life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.
p233
aVWe've had to clear land.
p234
aVWe've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,
p235
aVfertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.
p236
aVAll of the embodied impacts in that lettuce
p237
aVget lost from the system,
p238
aVwhich makes it a far bigger environmental impact
p239
aVthan the loss of the energy from the fridge.
p240
aVSo we need to design things like this far better
p241
aVif we're going to start addressing serious environmental problems.
p242
aVWe could start with the crisper drawer and the size.
p243
aVFor those of you in the room who do design fridges,
p244
aVthat would be great.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe problem is, imagine if we
p247
aVactually started to reconsider  how we designed things.
p248
aVSo I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,
p249
aVbut we actually haven't really changed the design
p250
aVof them that much since the 1950s.
p251
aVA little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,
p252
aVcold boxes that we store stuff in.
p253
aVSo imagine if we actually really started
p254
aVto identify these problems and use that
p255
aVas the foundation for finding innovative and elegant
p256
aVdesign solutions that will solve those problems.
p257
aVThis is design-led system change,
p258
aVdesign dictating the way in which the system
p259
aVcan be far more sustainable.
p260
aVForty percent food waste is a major problem.
p261
aVImagine if we designed fridges that halved that.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnother item that I find fascinating
p264
aVis the electric tea kettle,
p265
aVwhich I found out that
p266
aVyou don't do tea kettles in this country, really, do you?
p267
aVBut that's really big in the U.K.
p268
aVNinety-seven percent of households
p269
aVin the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.
p270
aVSo they're very popular.
p271
aVAnd, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm
p272
aVor a designer, and they were designing one of these,
p273
aVand they wanted to do it eco,
p274
aVthey'd usually ask me two things.
p275
aVThey'd say, "Leyla, how do I make it technically efficient?"
p276
aVBecause obviously energy's a problem with this product.
p277
aVOr, "How do I make it green materials?
p278
aVHow do I make the materials green
p279
aVin the manufacturing?"
p280
aVWould you ask me those questions?
p281
aVThey seem logical, right? Yeah.
p282
aVWell I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."
p283
aVBecause the problem is with use.
p284
aVIt's with how people use the product.
p285
aVSixty-five percent of Brits
p286
aVadmit to over-filling their kettle
p287
aVwhen they only need one cup of tea.
p288
aVAll of this extra water that's being boiled
p289
aVrequires energy, and it's been calculated
p290
aVthat in one day of extra energy use
p291
aVfrom boiling kettles
p292
aVis enough to light all of the streetlights
p293
aVin England for a night.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut this is the thing.
p296
aVThis is what I call a product-person failure.
p297
aVBut we've got a product-system failure going on with these little guys,
p298
aVand they're so ubiquitous, you  don't even notice they're there.
p299
aVAnd this guy over here, though, he does. He's named Simon.
p300
aVSimon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.
p301
aVHe has a very important job of monitoring
p302
aVall of the electricity coming into the system
p303
aVto make sure there is enough
p304
aVso it powers everybody's homes.
p305
aVHe's also watching television.
p306
aVThe reason is because there's a unique
p307
aVphenomenon that happens in the U.K.
p308
aVthe moment that very popular TV shows end.
p309
aVThe minute the ad break comes on,
p310
aVthis man has to rush
p311
aVto buy nuclear power from France,
p312
aVbecause everybody turns their kettles on
p313
aVat the same time.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aV1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.
p316
aVSo imagine if you designed kettles,
p317
aVyou actually found a way to solve these system failures,
p318
aVbecause this is a huge amount of pressure
p319
aVon the system,
p320
aVjust because the product hasn't thought about the problem
p321
aVthat it's going to have when it exists in the world.
p322
aVNow, I looked at a number of kettles available on the market,
p323
aVand found the minimum fill lines,
p324
aVso the little piece of information that tells you
p325
aVhow much you need to put in there,
p326
aVwas between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water
p327
aVjust to make one cup of tea.
p328
aVSo this kettle here is an example of one where
p329
aVit actually has two reservoirs.
p330
aVOne's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.
p331
aVThe user actually has to push that button
p332
aVto get their hot water boiled,
p333
aVwhich means, because we're all lazy,
p334
aVyou only fill exactly what you need.
p335
aVAnd this is what I call behavior-changing products:
p336
aVproducts, systems or services
p337
aVthat intervene and solve these problems up front.
p338
aa(lp339
VNow, this is a technology arena,
p340
aVso obviously these things are quite popular,
p341
aVbut I think if we're going to keep
p342
aVdesigning, buying and using and throwing out
p343
aVthese kinds of products at the rate we currently do,
p344
aVwhich is astronomically high,
p345
aVthere are seven billion people
p346
aVwho live in the world right now.
p347
aVThere are six billion mobile phone subscriptions
p348
aVas of last year.
p349
aVEvery single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones
p350
aVroll off production lines,
p351
aVand some companies report their production rate
p352
aVas being greater than the human birth rate.
p353
aVOne hundred fifty-two million phones  were thrown out in the U.S. last year;
p354
aVonly 11 percent were recycled.
p355
aVI'm from Australia. We have a population of 22 million \u2014 don't laugh \u2014
p356
aVand it's been reported that 22 million phones
p357
aVare in people's drawers.
p358
aVWe need to find ways of solving the problems around this,
p359
aVbecause these things are so complicated.
p360
aVThey have so much locked up inside them.
p361
aVGold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now
p362
aVto get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones
p363
aVthan it is out of a ton of gold ore?
p364
aVThere's a number of highly complex and valuable
p365
aVmaterials embodied inside these things,
p366
aVso we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,
p367
aVbecause this is otherwise what happens.
p368
aVThis is a community in Ghana,
p369
aVand e-waste is reported, or electronic waste
p370
aVis reported by the U.N.
p371
aVas being up to 50 million tons trafficked.
p372
aVThis is how they get the gold
p373
aVand the other valuable materials out.
p374
aVThey burn the electronic waste
p375
aVin open spaces.
p376
aVThese are communities, and this is happening all over the world.
p377
aVAnd because we don't see the ramifications
p378
aVof the choices that we make as designers,
p379
aVas businesspeople, as consumers,
p380
aVthen these kinds of externalities happen,
p381
aVand these are people's lives.
p382
aVSo we need to find smarter, more systems-based,
p383
aVinnovative solutions to these problems,
p384
aVif we're going to start to live sustainably within this world.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,
p387
aVyour new one because you replaced your old one \u2014
p388
aVafter 15 to 18 months is the average time
p389
aVthat people replace their phones, by the way \u2014
p390
aVso if we're going to keep this kind of expedient
p391
aVmobile phone replacing, then we should
p392
aVbe looking at closing the loop on these systems.
p393
aVThe people who produce these phones,
p394
aVand some of which I'm sure are in the room right now,
p395
aVcould potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems,
p396
aVor product system services,
p397
aVso identifying that there is a market demand
p398
aVand that market demand's not going to go anywhere,
p399
aVso you design the product to solve the problem.
p400
aVDesign for disassembly, design for light-weighting.
p401
aVWe heard some of those kinds of strategies
p402
aVbeing used in the Tesla Motors car today.
p403
aVThese kinds of approaches are not hard,
p404
aVbut understanding the system
p405
aVand then looking for viable, market-driven
p406
aVconsumer demand alternatives
p407
aVis how we can start radically altering
p408
aVthe sustainability agenda,
p409
aVbecause I hate to break it to you all:
p410
aVConsumption is the biggest problem.
p411
aVBut design is one of the best solutions.
p412
aa(lp413
VThese kinds of products are everywhere.
p414
aVBy identifying alternative ways of doing things,
p415
aVwe can actually start to innovate,
p416
aVand I say actually start to innovate.
p417
aVI'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.
p418
aVBut in the regards to using sustainability
p419
aVas a parameter, as a criteria
p420
aVfor fueling systems-based solutions,
p421
aVbecause as I've just demonstrated with these simple products,
p422
aVthey're participating in these major problems.
p423
aVSo we need to look across the entire life
p424
aVof the things that we do.
p425
aa(lp426
VIf you just had paper or plastic \u2014
p427
aVobviously reusable is far more beneficial \u2014
p428
aVthen the paper is worse,
p429
aVand the paper is worse because it weighs
p430
aVfour to 10 times more than the plastic,
p431
aVand when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective,
p432
aVa kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,
p433
aVthe paper is far better,
p434
aVbut the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag
p435
aVto carry your groceries home is not  done with a kilo of each material.
p436
aVIt's done with a very small amount of plastic
p437
aVand quite a lot more paper.
p438
aVBecause functionality defines environmental impact,
p439
aVand I said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco-materials.
p440
aVI say, there's only a few materials that you should completely avoid.
p441
aVThe rest of them, it's all about application,
p442
aVand at the end of the day, everything we design and produce in the economy
p443
aVor buy as consumers is done so for function.
p444
aVWe want something, therefore we buy it.
p445
aVSo breaking things back down and delivering
p446
aVsmartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions
p447
aVthat take into consideration the entire system
p448
aVand the entire life of the thing, everything,
p449
aVall the way back to the extraction through to the end of life,
p450
aVwe can start to actually find really innovative solutions.
p451
aa(lp452
VAnd I'll just leave you with one very quick thing
p453
