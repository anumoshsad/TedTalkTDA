VOn March 10, 2011,
p4
aVI was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab
p5
aVmeeting with faculty, students and staff,
p6
aVand we were trying to figure out whether
p7
aVI should be the next director.
p8
aa(lp9
VThat night, at midnight,
p10
aVa magnitude 9 earthquake
p11
aVhit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.
p12
aVMy wife and family were in Japan,
p13
aVand as the news started to come in,
p14
aVI was panicking.
p15
aVI was looking at the news streams
p16
aVand listening to the press conferences
p17
aVof the government officials
p18
aVand the Tokyo Power Company,
p19
aVand hearing about this explosion
p20
aVat the nuclear reactors
p21
aVand this cloud of fallout
p22
aVthat was headed towards our house
p23
aVwhich was only about 200 kilometers away.
p24
aVAnd the people on TV weren't telling us
p25
aVanything that we wanted to hear.
p26
aVI wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,
p27
aVwhat was going on with the radiation,
p28
aVwhether my family was in danger.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,
p31
aVwhich was to go onto the Internet
p32
aVand try to figure out
p33
aVif I could take matters into my own hands.
p34
aVOn the Net, I found there were a lot of other people
p35
aVlike me trying to figure out what was going on,
p36
aVand together we sort of loosely formed a group
p37
aVand we called it Safecast,
p38
aVand we decided we were going to try
p39
aVto measure the radiation
p40
aVand get the data out to everybody else,
p41
aVbecause it was clear that the government
p42
aVwasn't going to be doing this for us.
p43
aa(lp44
VThree years later,
p45
aVwe have 16 million data points,
p46
aVwe have designed our own Geiger counters
p47
aVthat you can download the designs
p48
aVand plug it into the network.
p49
aVWe have an app that shows you
p50
aVmost of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world.
p51
aVWe are arguably one of the most successful
p52
aVcitizen science projects in the world,
p53
aVand we have created
p54
aVthe largest open dataset of radiation measurements.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd the interesting thing here
p57
aVis how did \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 Thank you.
p58
aVHow did a bunch of amateurs
p59
aVwho really didn't know what we were doing
p60
aVsomehow come together
p61
aVand do what NGOs and the government
p62
aVwere completely incapable of doing?
p63
aVAnd I would suggest that this has something to do
p64
aVwith the Internet. It's not a fluke.
p65
aVIt wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.
p66
aVIt helped that it was an event
p67
aVthat pulled everybody together,
p68
aVbut it was a new way of doing things
p69
aVthat was enabled by the Internet
p70
aVand a lot of the other things that were going on,
p71
aVand I want to talk a little bit about
p72
aVwhat those new principles are.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo remember before the Internet? (Laughter)
p75
aVI call this B.I. Okay?
p76
aVSo, in B.I., life was simple.
p77
aVThings were Euclidian, Newtonian,
p78
aVsomewhat predictable.
p79
aVPeople actually tried to predict the future,
p80
aVeven the economists.
p81
aVAnd then the Internet happened,
p82
aVand the world became extremely complex,
p83
aVextremely low-cost, extremely fast,
p84
aVand those Newtonian laws
p85
aVthat we so dearly cherished
p86
aVturned out to be just local ordinances,
p87
aVand what we found was that in this
p88
aVcompletely unpredictable world
p89
aVthat most of the people who were surviving
p90
aVwere working with sort of a different set of principles,
p91
aVand I want to talk a little bit about that.
p92
aa(lp93
VBefore the Internet, if you remember,
p94
aVwhen we tried to create services,
p95
aVwhat you would do is you'd create
p96
aVthe hardware layer and the network layer and the software
p97
aVand it would cost millions of dollars
p98
aVto do anything that was substantial.
p99
aVSo when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial,
p100
aVwhat you would do is you'd get an MBA
p101
aVwho would write a plan
p102
aVand get the money
p103
aVfrom V.C.s or big companies,
p104
aVand then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,
p105
aVand they'd build the thing.
p106
aVThis is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.
p107
aVWhat happened after the Internet was
p108
aVthe cost of innovation went down so much
p109
aVbecause the cost of collaboration, the cost of distribution,
p110
aVthe cost of communication, and Moore's Law
p111
aVmade it so that the cost of trying a new thing
p112
aVbecame nearly zero,
p113
aVand so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,
p114
aVstudents that didn't have permission \u2014
p115
aVpermissionless innovation \u2014
p116
aVdidn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,
p117
aVthey just built the thing,
p118
aVthen they raised the money,
p119
aVand then they sort of figured out a business plan
p120
aVand maybe later on they hired some MBAs.
p121
aVSo the Internet caused innovation,
p122
aVat least in software and services,
p123
aVto go from an MBA-driven innovation model
p124
aVto a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,
p125
aVand it pushed innovation to the edges,
p126
aVto the dorm rooms, to the startups,
p127
aVaway from the large institutions,
p128
aVthe stodgy old institutions that had the power
p129
aVand the money and the authority.
p130
aVAnd we all know this. We all know this happened on the Internet.
p131
aVIt turns out it's happening in other things, too.
p132
aVLet me give you some examples.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.
p135
aVWe do all kinds of things.
p136
aVWe do biology, we do hardware,
p137
aVand Nicholas Negroponte famously said, "Demo or die,"
p138
aVas opposed to "Publish or perish,"
p139
aVwhich was the traditional academic way of thinking.
p140
aVAnd he often said, the demo only has to work once,
p141
aVbecause the primary mode of us impacting the world
p142
aVwas through large companies
p143
aVbeing inspired by us
p144
aVand creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.
p145
aVBut today, with the ability
p146
aVto deploy things into the real world at such low cost,
p147
aVI'm changing the motto now,
p148
aVand this is the official public statement.
p149
aVI'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."
p150
aVYou have to get the stuff into the real world
p151
aVfor it to really count,
p152
aVand sometimes it will be large companies,
p153
aVand Nicholas can talk about satellites.
p154
aV(Applause)
p155
aVThank you.
p156
aVBut we should be getting out there ourselves
p157
aVand not depending on large institutions to do it for us.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo last year, we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen,
p160
aVand they sat on the factory floors
p161
aVwith the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.
p162
aVWhat was happening there
p163
aVwas you would have these manufacturing devices,
p164
aVand they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.
p165
aVThey were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment
p166
aVand innovating right on the manufacturing equipment.
p167
aVThe factory was in the designer,
p168
aVand the designer was literally in the factory.
p169
aVAnd so what you would do is,
p170
aVyou'd go down to the stalls
p171
aVand you would see these cell phones.
p172
aVSo instead of starting little websites
p173
aVlike the kids in Palo Alto do,
p174
aVthe kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.
p175
aVThey make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto
p176
aVmake websites,
p177
aVand so there's a rainforest
p178
aVof innovation going on in the cell phone.
p179
aVWhat they do is, they make a cell phone,
p180
aVgo down to the stall, they sell some,
p181
aVthey look at the other kids' stuff, go up,
p182
aVmake a couple thousand more, go down.
p183
aVDoesn't this sound like a software thing?
p184
aVIt sounds like agile software development,
p185
aVA/B testing and iteration,
p186
aVand what we thought you could only do with software
p187
aVkids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.
p188
aVMy next fellow, I hope, is going to be
p189
aVone of these innovators from Shenzhen.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd so what you see is
p192
aVthat is pushing innovation to the edges.
p193
aVWe talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,
p194
aVand that's great, but this is Limor.
p195
aVShe is one of our favorite graduates,
p196
aVand she is standing in front of a Samsung
p197
aVTechwin Pick and Place Machine.
p198
aVThis thing can put 23,000 components per hour
p199
aVonto an electronics board.
p200
aVThis is a factory in a box.
p201
aVSo what used to take a factory full of workers
p202
aVworking by hand
p203
aVin this little box in New York,
p204
aVshe's able to have effectively \u2014
p205
aVShe doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen
p206
aVto do this manufacturing.
p207
aVShe can buy this box and she can manufacture it.
p208
aVSo manufacturing, the cost of innovation,
p209
aVthe cost of prototyping, distribution, manufacturing, hardware,
p210
aVis getting so low
p211
aVthat innovation is being pushed to the edges
p212
aVand students and startups are being able to build it.
p213
aVThis is a recent thing, but this will happen
p214
aVand this will change
p215
aVjust like it did with software.
p216
aa(lp217
VSorona is a DuPont process
p218
aVthat uses a genetically engineered microbe
p219
aVto turn corn sugar into polyester.
p220
aVIt's 30 percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method,
p221
aVand it's much better for the environment.
p222
aVGenetic engineering and bioengineering
p223
aVare creating a whole bunch
p224
aVof great new opportunities
p225
aVfor chemistry, for computation, for memory.
p226
aVWe will probably be doing a lot, obviously doing health things,
p227
aVbut we will probably be growing chairs
p228
aVand buildings soon.
p229
aVThe problem is, Sorona costs about 400 million dollars
p230
aVand took seven years to build.
p231
aVIt kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.
p232
aVThe thing is, the cost of innovation
p233
aVin bioengineering is also going down.
p234
aVThis is desktop gene sequencer.
p235
aVIt used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes.
p236
aVNow you can do it on a desktop like this,
p237
aVand kids can do this in dorm rooms.
p238
aVThis is Gen9 gene assembler,
p239
aVand so right now when you try to print a gene,
p240
aVwhat you do is somebody in a factory
p241
aVwith pipettes puts the thing together by hand,
p242
aVyou have one error per 100 base pairs,
p243
aVand it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.
p244
aVThis new device
p245
aVassembles genes on a chip,
p246
aVand instead of one error per 100 base pairs,
p247
aVit's one error per 10,000 base pairs.
p248
aVIn this lab, we will have the world's capacity
p249
aVof gene printing within a year,
p250
aV200 million base pairs a year.
p251
aVThis is kind of like when we went
p252
aVfrom transistor radios wrapped by hand
p253
aVto the Pentium.
p254
aVThis is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering,
p255
aVpushing bioengineering into the hands
p256
aVof dorm rooms and startup companies.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo it's happening in software and in hardware
p259
aVand bioengineering,
p260
aVand so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation.
p261
aVIt's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,
p262
aVit's chaotic, it's hard to control.
p263
aVIt's not bad, but it's very different,
p264
aVand I think that the traditional rules that we have
p265
aVfor institutions don't work anymore,
p266
aVand most of us here
p267
aVoperate with a different set of principles.
p268
aVOne of my favorite principles is the power of pull,
p269
aVwhich is the idea of pulling resources
p270
aVfrom the network as you need them
p271
aVrather than stocking them in the center
p272
aVand controlling everything.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo in the case of the Safecast story,
p275
aVI didn't know anything when the earthquake happened,
p276
aVbut I was able to find Sean
p277
aVwho was the hackerspace community organizer,
p278
aVand Peter, the analog hardware hacker
p279
aVwho made our first Geiger counter,
p280
aVand Dan, who built the Three Mile Island
p281
aVmonitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown.
p282
aVAnd these people I wouldn't have been able to find
p283
aVbeforehand and probably were better
p284
aVthat I found them just in time from the network.
p285
aa(lp286
VI'm a three-time college dropout,
p287
aVso learning over education
p288
aVis very near and dear to my heart,
p289
aVbut to me, education is what people do to you
p290
aVand learning is what you do to yourself.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd it feels like, and I'm biased,
p295
aVit feels like they're trying to make you memorize
p296
aVthe whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play,
p297
aVand to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,
p298
aVand it feels like they assume
p299
aVyou're going to be on top of some mountain
p300
aVall by yourself with a number 2 pencil
p301
aVtrying to figure out what to do
p302
aVwhen in fact you're always going to be connected,
p303
aVyou're always going to have friends,
p304
aVand you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it,
p305
aVand what you need to learn is how to learn.
p306
aVIn the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs
p307
aVwhen we started three years ago,
p308
aVI would argue that we probably as a group
p309
aVknow more than any other organization
p310
aVabout how to collect data and publish data
p311
aVand do citizen science.
p312
aa(lp313
VCompass over maps.
p314
aVSo this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan
p315
aVor mapping something is getting so expensive
p316
aVand it's not very accurate or useful.
p317
aVSo in the Safecast story, we knew we needed to collect data,
p318
aVwe knew we wanted to publish the data,
p319
aVand instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,
p320
aVwe first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.
p321
aVOh, they've run out.
p322
aVLet's build them. There aren't enough sensors.
p323
aVOkay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.
p324
aVWe can drive around. We can get volunteers.
p325
aVWe don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.
p326
aVWe could not have planned this whole thing,
p327
aVbut by having a very strong compass,
p328
aVwe eventually got to where we were going,
p329
aVand to me it's very similar to agile software development,
p330
aVbut this idea of compasses is very important.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo I think the good news is
p333
aVthat even though the world is extremely complex,
p334
aVwhat you need to do is very simple.
p335
aVI think it's about stopping this notion
p336
aVthat you need to plan everything,
p337
aVyou need to stock everything,
p338
aVand you need to be so prepared,
p339
aVand focus on being connected,
p340
aValways learning,
p341
aVfully aware,
p342
aVand super present.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo I don't like the word "futurist."
p345
aVI think we should be now-ists,
p346
aVlike we are right now.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.
