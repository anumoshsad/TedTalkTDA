VNamaste. Salaam.
p4
aVShalom. Sat Sri Akal.
p5
aVGreetings to all of you from Pakistan.
p6
aVIt is often said that we fear that which we do not know.
p7
aVAnd Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.
p8
aVBecause it has provoked, and does provoke,
p9
aVa visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,
p10
aVespecially when viewed through the monochromatic lens
p11
aVof turbulence and turmoil.
p12
aVBut there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd what follows is a stream of images,
p15
aVa series of images captured by some of Pakistan's
p16
aVmost dynamic and young photographers,
p17
aVthat aims to give you an alternative glimpse,
p18
aVa look inside the hearts and minds
p19
aVof some ordinary Pakistani citizens.
p20
aVHere are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.
p21
aa(lp22
VMy name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.
p23
aVI hope that you will be able to see
p24
aVnot just my Taliban-like beard,
p25
aVbut also the richness and color
p26
aVof my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,
p27
aVas rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.
p28
aa(lp29
VMy name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.
p30
aVI hope to become a vet when I grow up
p31
aVso that I can take care of stray cats and dogs
p32
aVwho wander around the streets of the village
p33
aVthat I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.
p34
aa(lp35
VMy name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives
p36
aVthrough technicolored glass.
p37
aVMadame, would you like some of those orange bangles
p38
aVwith the pink polka dots?
p39
aa(lp40
VMy name is Zamin.
p41
aVAnd I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,
p42
aVfrom Swat.
p43
aVDo you see me on the other side of this fence?
p44
aVDo I matter, or really exist for you?
p45
aa(lp46
VMy name is Iman. I am a fashion model,
p47
aVan up-and-coming model from Lahore.
p48
aVDo you see me simply smothered in cloth?
p49
aVOr can you move beyond my veil
p50
aVand see me for who I truly am inside?
p51
aa(lp52
VMy name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee
p53
aVfrom the Khyber agency.
p54
aVI have come from a place of intense darkness.
p55
aVAnd that is why I want to illuminate the world.
p56
aa(lp57
VMy name is Papusay.
p58
aVMy heart and drum beat as one.
p59
aVIf religion is the opium of the masses,
p60
aVthen for me, music is my one and only ganja.
p61
aa(lp62
VA rising tide lifts all boats.
p63
aVAnd the rising tide of India's
p64
aVspectacular economic growth
p65
aVhas lifted over 400 million
p66
aVIndians into a buoyant middle class.
p67
aVBut there are still over 650 million Indians,
p68
aVPakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,
p69
aVwho remain washed up on the shores of poverty.
p70
aa(lp71
VTherefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,
p72
aVit behooves us to transcend our differences,
p73
aVto celebrate our diversity,
p74
aVto leverage our common humanity.
p75
aVOur collective vision at Naya Jeevan,
p76
aVwhich for many of you, as you all recognize,
p77
aVmeans "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,
p78
aVis to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families
p79
aVby providing them with affordable access
p80
aVto catastrophic health care.
p81
aVIndeed it is the emerging world's first
p82
aVHMO for the urban working poor.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhy should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?
p85
aVWe are but two threads cut from the same cloth.
p86
aVAnd if our fates are intertwined,
p87
aVthen we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.
p88
aVAnd for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie
p89
aVat the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.
p90
aV(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VChris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.
p93
aVThat was fantastic.
p94
aVI found that really moving.
p95
aVYou know, we fought hard to get at least
p96
aVa small Pakistani contingent to come.
p97
aVIt felt like it was really important.
p98
aVThey went through a lot to get here.
p99
aVWould the Pakistanis please just stand up please?
p100
aVI just really wanted to acknowledge you.
p101
aV(Applause)
