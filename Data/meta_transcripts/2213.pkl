VTraditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.
p4
aVAfter one trillion dollars in African development-related aid
p5
aVin the last 60 years,
p6
aVreal per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.
p7
aVAid is not doing too well.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn response,
p10
aVthe Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the IMF and the World Bank \u2014
p11
aVpushed for free trade not aid,
p12
aVyet the historical record shows little empirical evidence
p13
aVthat free trade leads to economic growth.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe newly prescribed  silver bullet is microcredit.
p16
aVWe seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea
p17
aVthat every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVYet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa
p20
aVhave taught me that most people want jobs instead.
p21
aa(lp22
VMy solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.
p23
aVLet's invest in building pan-African titans
p24
aVlike Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.
p25
aVMo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98
p26
aVand built it into a mobile  cellular provider
p27
aVwith 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.
p28
aVThe Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model,
p29
aVwhich prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.
p30
aVPerhaps we are not at a stage in Africa
p31
aVwhere many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition.
p32
aa(lp33
VConsider these two alternative scenarios.
p34
aVOne: You loan 200 dollars  to each of 500 banana farmers
p35
aVallowing them to dry  their surplus bananas
p36
aVand fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market.
p37
aVOr two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur
p38
aVand help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income
p39
aVto all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.
p40
aVWe invested in the second scenario,
p41
aVand backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi
p42
aVto set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi
p43
aVto produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food.
p44
aVStawi is leveraging economies of scale
p45
aVand using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners
p46
aVbut its workers, who have an ownership in the business.
p47
aVOur dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,
p48
aVwhich requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships,
p49
aVand extraordinary perseverance.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut why pan-African?
p52
aVThe scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 \u2014
p53
aVwhere, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted \u2014
p54
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p55
aVresulted in massive fragmentation
p56
aVand many sovereign states with small populations:
p57
aVLiberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000.
p58
aVPan-Africa gives you one billion people,
p59
aVgranted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments,
p60
aVbut our ancestors traded across the continent
p61
aVbefore Europeans drew lines around us.
p62
aVThe pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges,
p63
aVand that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya
p64
aVto Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food.
p65
aVWe hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs,
p66
aVdevelop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.
p67
aVWhile it's not the sexiest approach,
p68
aVand maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good
p69
aVas giving a woman 100 dollars  to buy a goat on kiva.org,
p70
aVperhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs
p71
aVto build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa
p72
aVcan help change this.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe political freedom for which our forebearers fought
p75
aVis meaningless without economic freedom.
p76
aVWe hope to aid this fight for economic freedom
p77
aVby building world-class businesses,
p78
aVcreating indigenous wealth,
p79
aVproviding jobs that we so desperately need,
p80
aVand hopefully helping achieve this.
p81
aa(lp82
VAfrica shall rise.
p83
aa(lp84
VThank you.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VTom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.
p89
aVYou're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit
p90
aVand regular investment and growing regular investment.
p91
aVDo you think there is a role for microcredit at all?
p92
aa(lp93
VSangu Delle: I think there is a role.
p94
aVMicrocredit has been a great, innovative way
p95
aVto expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.
p96
aVBut for the problems we face in Africa,
p97
aVwhen we are looking at the Marshall Plan
p98
aVto revitalize war-torn Europe,
p99
aVit was not full of donations of sheep.
p100
aVWe need more than just microcredit.
p101
aVWe need more than just give 200 dollars.
p102
aVWe need to build big businesses, and we need jobs.
p103
