VI hope you'll understand my English.
p4
aVIn the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVDuring many years, I made some speeches starting with this
p7
aVsaying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
p8
aVAnd more and more, I'm convinced that
p9
aVit's not only a solution for a country,
p10
aVbut it's a solution for the problem of climate change.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.
p13
aVI'm working in cities for almost 40 years,
p14
aVand where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,
p15
aVor the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"
p16
aVI would like to say
p17
aVfrom the experience I had: every city in the world
p18
aVcan be improved in less than three years.
p19
aVThere's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,
p20
aVit's not a question of financial resources.
p21
aVEvery problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility
p22
aVand also a design.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo to start, I want to introduce some characters
p25
aVfrom a book I made for teenagers.
p26
aVThe best example of quality of life is the turtle
p27
aVbecause the turtle is an example of living and working together.
p28
aVAnd when you realize that the casque of the turtle
p29
aVlooks like an urban tessitura,
p30
aVand can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?
p31
aVAnd that's what we're doing in our cities:
p32
aVliving here, working here, having leisure here.
p33
aVAnd most of the people are leaving the city
p34
aVand living outside of the city.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, the other character is Otto, the automobile.
p37
aVHe is invited for a party \u2014 he never wants to leave.
p38
aVThe chairs are on the tables and still drinking,
p39
aVand he drinks a lot. (Laughter)
p40
aVAnd he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:
p41
aVhe carries only one or two people
p42
aVand he asks always for more infrastructure.
p43
aVFreeways.
p44
aVHe's a very demanding person.
p45
aVAnd on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,
p46
aVhe carries 300 people \u2014
p47
aV275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSpeaking about the design: every city has its own design.
p50
aVCuritiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,
p51
aV1,800,000 people in the city itself.
p52
aVCuritiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.
p53
aVOaxaca, San Francisco \u2014 it's very easy:
p54
aVMarket Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.
p55
aVAnd every city has its own design.
p56
aVBut to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario
p57
aVand to propose a design \u2014
p58
aVan idea that everyone, or the large majority,
p59
aVwill help you to make it happen.
p60
aVAnd that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd it's an example of living and working together.
p63
aVAnd this is where we have more density;
p64
aVit's where we have more public transport.
p65
aVSo, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,
p66
aVnow it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.
p67
aVAnd it took 25 years until another city ...
p68
aVwhich is Bogota, and they did a very good job.
p69
aVAnd now there's 83 cities all over the world that they
p70
aVare doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.
p71
aVAnd one thing: it's important not for only your own city;
p72
aVevery city, besides its normal problems,
p73
aVthey have a very important role
p74
aVin being with the whole humanity.
p75
aVThat means mostly two main issues \u2014
p76
aVmobility and sustainability \u2014 are becoming very important for the cities.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.
p79
aVAnd we are very close to my house.
p80
aVYou can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.
p81
aVAnd that's the evolution of the system.
p82
aVWhat in the design that made the difference
p83
aVis the boarding tubes:
p84
aVthe boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.
p85
aVThat's why, I'm trying to say,
p86
aVit's like metro-nizing the bus.
p87
aVThis is the design of the bus,
p88
aVand you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.
p89
aVAnd for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat I'm trying to say is
p92
aVthe major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars \u2014
p93
aVmore than 50 percent \u2014 so when we depend only on cars, it's ...
p94
aV\u2014 that's why when we're talking about sustainability,
p95
aVit's not enough, green buildings.
p96
aVIt's not enough, a new materials.
p97
aVIt's not enough, new sources of energy.
p98
aVIt's the concept of the city, the design of the city,
p99
aVthat's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.
p100
aVI'll speak on this later on.
p101
aa(lp102
VOur idea of mobility is trying
p103
aVto make the connections between all the systems.
p104
aVWe started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio
p105
aVhow to connect the subway with the bus.
p106
aVThe subway was against, of course.
p107
aVAnd 23 years after, they called us to develop \u2014 we're developing this idea.
p108
aVAnd you can understand how different it's going to be,
p109
aVthe image of Rio with the system \u2014
p110
aVone-minute frequency.
p111
aVAnd it's not Shanghai,
p112
aVit's not being colored during the day, only at night
p113
aVit will look this way.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd before you say it's a Norman Foster design,
p116
aVwe designed this in '83.
p117
aVAnd this is the model,
p118
aVhow it's going to work. So, it's the same system;
p119
aVthe vehicle is different. And that's the model.
p120
aVWhat I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying
p121
aVto prove which system of transport is better.
p122
aVI'm trying to say we have to combine
p123
aVall the systems, and with one condition:
p124
aVnever \u2014 if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,
p125
aVif you have any kind of system \u2014
p126
aVnever compete in the same space.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd coming back to the car, I always used to say
p129
aVthat the car is like your mother-in-law:
p130
aVyou have to have good relationship with her,
p131
aVbut she cannot command your life.
p132
aVSo, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,
p133
aVyou have a problem. (Laughter)
p134
aVSo, all the ideas about how to transform through design \u2014
p135
aVold quarries and open universities and botanic garden \u2014
p136
aVall of it's related to how we teach the children.
p137
aVAnd the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
p138
aVAnd after, the children teach their parents.
p139
aVAnd now we have 70 percent \u2014
p140
aVsince 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.
p141
aVSeven zero.
p142
aV(Applause)
p143
aVSo teach the children.
p144
aa(lp145
VI would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world
p146
aVwe have to work with everything what's said,
p147
aVbut don't forget the cities and the children.
p148
aVI'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,
p149
aVbecause you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.
p150
aVYou should have always
p151
aVa structure of living and working together.
p152
aVTry to understand the sectors in the city
p153
aVthat could play different roles during the 24 hours.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnother issue is, a city's like our family portrait.
p156
aVWe don't rip our family portrait,
p157
aVeven if we don't like the nose of our uncle,
p158
aVbecause this portrait is you.
p159
aVAnd these are the references that we have in any city.
p160
aVThis is the main pedestrian mall;
p161
aVwe did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.
p162
aVAnd these are the references from our ethnic contribution.
p163
aVThis is the Italian portal,
p164
aVthe Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.
p165
aVAll of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.
p166
aVAnd since we have people from
p167
aVUzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],
p168
aVwe have to stop the program.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VDon't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.
p172
aVIf you cut two zeros, it's much better.
p173
aVAnd this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.
p174
aVParks \u2014 old quarries that they were transformed into parks.
p175
aVQuarries once made the nature, and
p176
aVsometimes we took this and we transformed.
p177
aVAnd every part can be transformed;
p178
aVevery frog can be transformed in a prince.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, in a city, you have to work fast.
p181
aVPlanning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.
p182
aVThat means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.
p183
aVAnd this is an acupuncture note \u2014
p184
aVor I.M. Pei's. Some small ones
p185
aVcan make the city better.
p186
aVThe smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:
p187
aV32 meters.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, I want just to end saying
p190
aVthat you can always propose new materials \u2014 new sustainable materials \u2014
p191
aVbut keep in mind that we have to work fast
p192
aVto the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.
p193
aVAnd I think creativity, innovation is starting.
p194
aVAnd we cannot have all the answers.
p195
aVSo when you start \u2014
p196
aVand we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers \u2014
p197
aVit's important starting and having the contribution from people,
p198
aVand they could teach you
p199
aVif you're not in the right track.
p200
aa(lp201
VAt the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.
p202
aVOK?
p203
aVPlease, allow me just two minutes.
p204
aVYou're going to make the music and the rhythm.
