(lp3
VSo my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
p4
aV"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."
p5
aVAnd having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
p6
aVI sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder \u2014
p7
aVthank God for technology \u2014
p8
aVto interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words \u2014
p9
aVwhich is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform \u2014
p10
aVif I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
p11
aVI was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
p12
aVwho wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo these four characters are going to be from that work
p15
aVthat I've been doing for many years now,
p16
aVand well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people
p17
aVI've interviewed.
p18
aVAnybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
p19
aVSo I thought he would be the perfect person
p20
aVto go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
p21
aVYou know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,
p22
aVgreatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,
p23
aVand bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VSo this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
p27
aV"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;
p28
aVyou can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one \u2014
p29
aVI can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
p30
aVThe gradual slippage \u2014 'slippage' is the word
p31
aVused by the people in Watergate, moral slippage \u2014
p32
aVit's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
p33
aVYou see, we also have the technology.
p34
aVI say, less and less the human touch.
p35
aa(lp36
V"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.
p37
aVThe Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
p38
aVand they should leave the gate there.
p39
aVThese trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
p40
aVAnd these trains are smooth,
p41
aVand they're quiet and they're efficient.
p42
aVAnd there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
p43
aVYou see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
p44
aVNow we have humans imitating robots.
p45
aVSo we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
p46
aVConcourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
p47
aVJust as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
p48
aVand they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.
p49
aVAnd that voice, without losing a beat, says,
p50
aV'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'
p51
aVJust then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes
p52
aVand the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
p53
aVWell, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding \u2014
p54
aVI do that to steel my nerves \u2014 and so
p55
aVI imitate a train call, holding my hand on my \u2014
p56
aV'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
p57
aVWell, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
p58
aVwhen I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
p59
aVAnd so suddenly they're looking at me.
p60
aVSo here I am with the couple, the three of us
p61
aVshrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.
p62
aa(lp63
V"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.
p64
aVI know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.
p65
aVSo I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,
p66
aVholding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,
p67
aVI say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,
p68
aVwhat is your considered opinion of the human species?'
p69
aVAnd the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,
p70
aVstarts laughing,
p71
aVstarts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
p72
aVI say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'
p73
aa(lp74
V"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
p75
aVYou know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.
p76
aVYou know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain \u2014
p77
aVyou know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
p78
aVWe read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
p79
aVI mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
p80
aVRemember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
p81
aVYou see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,
p82
aVbut there's something in him.
p83
aVAnd the official truth, the truth was, the law was,
p84
aVthat a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.
p87
aVAnd he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids
p88
aVand steal them from the woman who owns them,
p89
aVand Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh \u2014
p90
aVthat woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
p91
aVOoh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;
p92
aVhe's going to do a terrible thing.'
p93
aVJust then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
p94
aV'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'
p95
aV'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
p96
aVAnd Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,
p97
aVI did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing \u2014 why do I feel so good?'
p98
aa(lp99
V"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,
p100
aVyou see, all been buried; it's all been buried.
p101
aVSo the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
p102
aVSo you ask about a defining moment \u2014
p103
aVain't no defining moment in American history for me.
p104
aVIt's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,
p105
aVwhere trivia becomes news.
p106
aVAnd more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.
p107
aVHuh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,
p108
aVbut I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,
p109
aV'We're more and more into communications
p110
aVand less and less into communication.'
p111
aVOkay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."
p112
aVAnd that's Studs Terkel.
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.
p116
aVYou know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable \u2014
p117
aVwell, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,
p118
aVI like to inspire people.
p119
aVBut since this was called "risk taking,"
p120
aVI'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable
p121
aVthat one person actually came backstage
p122
aVand told me to take her out of the show she was in.
p123
aVAnd I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,
p124
aVat a conference like this, as a good thing.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut there are certain other connotations to the word "risk,"
p127
aVand the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?
p128
aVMaxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher
p129
aVwho's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy \u2014
p130
aVgreat, big philosophy kind of an organization \u2014
p131
aVI went to her and asked her what are the two things
p132
aVthat she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.
p133
aVAnd she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey
p134
aVwhen I see the president of my university.
p135
aVAnd I still feel as though I've got to get coffee
p136
aVfor my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."
p137
aVAnd she said, "And then intellectually,
p138
aVI don't know enough about the negative imagination.
p139
aVAnd September 11th certainly taught us
p140
aVthat that's a whole area we don't investigate."
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this piece is about a negative imagination.
p143
aVIt raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,
p144
aVand about what a risk can be.
p145
aVAnd I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
p146
aVEverything I do is word for word off a tape.
p147
aVAnd I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,
p148
aVand this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."
p149
aVAnd this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
p150
aa(lp151
V"I began to learn how to cover it up,
p152
aVbecause I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
p153
aVI want everybody to think we were a normal family.
p154
aVI mean we had all the materialistic things,
p155
aVbut that didn't make my children pain any less;
p156
aVthat didn't make their fears subside.
p157
aVI ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes
p158
aVand busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
p159
aVAnd he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact
p160
aVthat it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.
p161
aVAnd I failed them dramatically,
p162
aVbecause I allowed it to go on and on and on.
p163
aa(lp164
V"But the night that Myesha got killed \u2014
p165
aVand the intensity just grew and grew and grew,
p166
aVuntil one night we came home from getting drugs,
p167
aVand he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,
p168
aVand he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.
p169
aVHe had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing
p170
aVthat Myesha was having sex with her little brother
p171
aVand they was fondling each other \u2014 that would be his reason.
p172
aVI'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
p173
aVAnd so he put her in the bathtub,
p174
aVand I was in the bedroom with the baby.
p175
aa(lp176
V"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,
p177
aVI thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him \u2014 insane \u2014
p178
aVthinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.
p179
aVAnd it didn't work, didn't work.
p180
aVAnd I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,
p181
aVwho was four months old when I came to jail.
p182
aa(lp183
V"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom
p184
aVand he \u2014 he \u2014 every time he hit her, she would fall.
p185
aVAnd she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.
p186
aVI could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.
p187
aVI didn't even go and see what was happening.
p188
aVI just sat there and listened.
p189
aVAnd then he put her in the hallway.
p190
aVHe told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.
p191
aVAnd then he told her, get up.
p192
aVAnd when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
p193
aVHer face was bruised. She had a black eye.
p194
aVAll around her head was just swollen;
p195
aVher head was about two sizes of its own size.
p196
aVI told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.
p197
aa(lp198
V"The next morning she was dead.
p199
aVHe went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.
p200
aVHe says, 'She won't breathe.'
p201
aVI knew immediately that she was dead.
p202
aVI didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in
p203
aVand I put a mirror to her mouth \u2014
p204
aVthere was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
p205
aVHe said, he said, he said,
p206
aV'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'
p207
aVHe say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.
p208
aa(lp209
V"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,
p210
aVso it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
p211
aVSo we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,
p212
aVthat she was missing.
p213
aVWe told a security guard that she was missing,
p214
aVthough she wasn't missing.
p215
aVAnd we told the security guard what we had put on her
p216
aVand we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing
p217
aVthat we had told the security guard that we had put on her.
p218
aa(lp219
V"And then we got the baby and my other child,
p220
aVand we drove out to, like, I-95.
p221
aVI was so petrified and so numb,
p222
aVall I could look was in the rear-view mirror.
p223
aVAnd he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
p224
aVMy own child, I let that happen to."
p225
aVSo that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VWhen I started this project
p229
aVcalled "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"
p230
aVwith my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America
p231
aVand find it in all its aspects \u2014 bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,
p232
aVdrum majorettes \u2014 but I sort of got tripped on race relations,
p233
aVbecause my first big show was a show about a race riot.
p234
aVAnd so I went to both \u2014 two race riots,
p235
aVone of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.
p236
aVBecause this is what I would say
p237
aVI've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.
p238
aVIt's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
p239
aa(lp240
VEverybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened
p241
aVbecause four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.
p242
aVIt was captured on videotape \u2014 technology \u2014
p243
aVand it was played all over the world.
p244
aVEverybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
p245
aVThey did not, so there were riots.
p246
aVAnd what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,
p247
aVordered by George Bush, Sr.
p248
aVAnd that trial came back with two cops going to jail
p249
aVand two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
p250
aVAnd I mean, the people just danced in the streets
p251
aVbecause they were afraid there was going to be another riot.
p252
aVExplosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo there was a community that didn't \u2014 the Korean-Americans,
p255
aVwhose stores had been burned to the ground.
p256
aVAnd so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,
p257
aVI suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
p258
aVAnd she asks also a question that Studs talks about:
p259
aVthis notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."
p260
aVSo what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance
p261
aVand questioning what justice is in society.
p262
aVAnd this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
p263
aa(lp264
V"I used to believe America was the best.
p265
aVI watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
p266
aVI never saw any poor man, any black.
p267
aVUntil 1992, I used to believe America was the best \u2014 I still do;
p268
aVI don't deny that because I am a victim.
p269
aVBut at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,
p270
aVand having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,
p271
aVI began to really realize that Koreans
p272
aVare completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
p273
aVWhy? Why do we have to be left out?
p274
aVWe didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,
p275
aa(lp276
Vno welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work
p277
aVgot minimum amount of money to survive.
p278
aVWe didn't get any because we have a car and a house.
p279
aVAnd we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?
p280
aV"OK. OK? OK. OK.
p281
aVMany African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
p282
aVI was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,
p283
aVand all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,
p284
aVall of South Central, all the churches. And they say,
p285
aV'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'
p286
aVWell, what about victims' rights?
p287
aVThey got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
p288
aVThey have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.
p289
aVHe is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.
p290
aVHe is the model of non-violence, non-violence \u2014
p291
aVand they would all like to be in his spirit.
p292
aa(lp293
V"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.
p294
aVAnd I wonder if that is really justice
p295
aVfor them, to get their rights in that way.
p296
aVI was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.
p297
aVThey became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
p298
aVI was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.
p299
aVLet's just forget about Korean victims and other victims
p300
aVwho were destroyed by them.
p301
aVThey fought for their rights for over two centuries,
p302
aVand maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,
p303
aVHispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
p304
aVThat's why I understand;
p305
aVthat's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.
p306
aa(lp307
V"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that
p308
aVI could be part of the enjoyment.
p309
aVI wish that I could live together with black people.
p310
aVBut after the riot, it's too much difference.
p311
aVThe fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].
p312
aVIgniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
p313
aVIt's still there; it can burst out anytime."
p314
aVMrs. Young-Soon Han.
p315
aV(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VThe other reason that I don't wear shoes
p318
aVis just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up
p319
aVand get into the feet of somebody,
p320
aVwalking really in somebody else's shoes.
p321
aVAnd I told you that in \u2014 you know, I didn't give you the year,
p322
aVbut in '79 I thought that I was going to go around
p323
aVand find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,
p324
aVand I got sidetracked on race relations.
p325
aa(lp326
VFinally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.
p327
aVAnd I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.
p328
aVAnd he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.
p329
aVHe's a Republican \u2014 I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway \u2014
p330
aVso this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,
p331
aVand this is on toughness,
p332
aVin case anybody needs to know about being tough
p333
aVfor the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.
p334
aVAnd this is called "Toughness."
p335
aa(lp336
V"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.
p337
aVI mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,
p338
aVher family's always saying,
p339
aVyou know, you ever think he's just a born loser?
p340
aVIt seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
p341
aVBut then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,
p342
aVI didn't lose my kidney \u2014 I could have lost my kidney,
p343
aVI kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.
p344
aVI think that's good luck.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
V"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.
p348
aVI was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,
p349
aVand there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.
p350
aVIt was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says
p351
aVif you want to get lucky,
p352
aVyou know, you've got to be around positive people.
p353
aVI mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here
p354
aVand talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;
p355
aVshe's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'
p356
aa(lp357
V"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here
p358
aVand interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
p359
aVShe said, 'Look who she is.
p360
aVYou're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aVAnd she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot
p363
aVbecause I've never been to college,
p364
aVand I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.
p365
aVI said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
p366
aVYou know, if I wasn't talking \u2014 you know,
p367
aVlike, you know, she wanted me to talk,
p368
aVI don't think she would even come out here.'
p369
aa(lp370
V"Confidence? Well, I think I ride
p371
aVmore out of determination than confidence.
p372
aVI mean, confidence is like, you know,
p373
aVyou've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
p374
aVI mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
p375
aVBut determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,
p376
aVget the horn.'
p377
aV(Laughter)
p378
aVThat's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'
p379
aVI mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,
p380
aVhe say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'
p381
aVAnd try and determination is the same thing.
p382
aVDetermination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,
p383
aVeven if you're riding upside down.
p384
aVDetermination's like, you're going to ride
p385
aVtill your head hits the back of the dirt.
p386
aa(lp387
V"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.
