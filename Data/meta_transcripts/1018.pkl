VOkay, I'm going to show you
p4
aVagain something about our diets.
p5
aVAnd I would like to know what the audience is,
p6
aVand so who of you ever ate insects?
p7
aVThat's quite a lot.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBut still, you're not representing
p10
aVthe overall population of the Earth.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVBecause there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
p13
aVBut this is quite good.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhy not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?
p16
aVInsects are animals that walk around on six legs.
p17
aVAnd here you see just a selection.
p18
aVThere's six million species of insects on this planet,
p19
aVsix million species.
p20
aVThere's a few hundreds of mammals \u2014
p21
aVsix million species of insects.
p22
aVIn fact, if we count all the individual organisms,
p23
aVwe would come at much larger numbers.
p24
aVIn fact, of all animals on Earth,
p25
aVof all animal species,
p26
aV80 percent walks on six legs.
p27
aVBut if we would count all the individuals,
p28
aVand we take an average weight of them,
p29
aVit would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms
p30
aVfor each of you and me on Earth.
p31
aVThat means that in terms of biomass,
p32
aVinsects are more abundant than we are,
p33
aVand we're not on a planet of men,
p34
aVbut we're on a planet of insects.
p35
aVInsects are not only there in nature,
p36
aVbut they also are involved in our economy,
p37
aVusually without us knowing.
p38
aa(lp39
VThere was an estimation,
p40
aVa conservative estimation, a couple of years ago
p41
aVthat the U.S. economy
p42
aVbenefited by 57 billion
p43
aVdollars per year.
p44
aVIt's a number \u2014 very large \u2014
p45
aVa contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
p46
aVAnd so I looked up what the economy was paying
p47
aVfor the war in Iraq
p48
aVin the same year.
p49
aVIt was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
p50
aVWell we know that that
p51
aVwas not a cheap war.
p52
aVSo insects, just for free,
p53
aVcontribute to the economy of the United States
p54
aVwith about the same order of magnitude,
p55
aVjust for free, without everyone knowing.
p56
aVAnd not only in the States,
p57
aVbut in any country, in any economy.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhat do they do?
p60
aVThey remove dung, they pollinate our crops.
p61
aVA third of all the fruits that we eat
p62
aVare all a result
p63
aVof insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.
p64
aVThey control pests,
p65
aVand they're food for animals.
p66
aVThey're at the start of food chains.
p67
aVSmall animals eat insects.
p68
aVEven larger animals eat insects.
p69
aVBut the small animals that eat insects
p70
aVare being eaten by larger animals,
p71
aVstill larger animals.
p72
aVAnd at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
p73
aVThere's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
p74
aVAnd here you see me
p75
aVin a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang \u2014
p76
aVabout two million inhabitants.
p77
aVIf you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,
p78
aVwhere you can select which fish you want to eat,
p79
aVyou can select which insects you would like to eat.
p80
aVAnd they prepare it in a wonderful way.
p81
aVAnd here you see me enjoying a meal
p82
aVwith caterpillars, locusts,
p83
aVbee pupae \u2014 delicacies.
p84
aVAnd you can eat something new everyday.
p85
aVThere's more than 1,000 species of insects
p86
aVthat are being eaten all around the globe.
p87
aVThat's quite a bit more
p88
aVthan just a few mammals that we're eating,
p89
aVlike a cow or a pig
p90
aVor a sheep.
p91
aVMore than 1,000 species \u2014
p92
aVan enormous variety.
p93
aVAnd now you may think, okay,
p94
aVin this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.
p95
aa(lp96
VWell we've seen already that quite some of you
p97
aValready ate insects maybe occasionally,
p98
aVbut I can tell you that every one of you
p99
aVis eating insects, without any exception.
p100
aVYou're eating at least
p101
aV500 grams per year.
p102
aVWhat are you eating?
p103
aVTomato soup, peanut butter,
p104
aVchocolate, noodles \u2014
p105
aVany processed food that you're eating
p106
aVcontains insects,
p107
aVbecause insects are here all around us,
p108
aVand when they're out there in nature
p109
aVthey're also in our crops.
p110
aVSome fruits get some insect damage.
p111
aVThose are the fruits, if they're tomato,
p112
aVthat go to the tomato soup.
p113
aVIf they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.
p114
aVAnd that's your view of a tomato.
p115
aVBut there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,
p116
aVand as long as they meet
p117
aVthe requirements of the food agency,
p118
aVthere can be all kinds of things in there,
p119
aVno problem.
p120
aVIn fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,
p121
aVthere's meat in there anyway?
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVIn fact, all our processed foods
p124
aVcontain more proteins
p125
aVthan we would be aware of.
p126
aVSo anything is a good protein source already.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow you may say,
p129
aV"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."
p130
aVWe're even doing this on purpose.
p131
aVIn a lot of food items that we have \u2014
p132
aVI have only two items
p133
aVhere on the slide \u2014
p134
aVpink cookies or surimi sticks
p135
aVor, if you like, Campari \u2014
p136
aVa lot of our food products that are of a red color
p137
aVare dyed with a natural dye.
p138
aVThe surimi sticks
p139
aV[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,
p140
aVis white fish
p141
aVthat's being dyed with cochineal.
p142
aVCochineal is a product
p143
aVof an insect that lives off these cacti.
p144
aVIt's being produced in large amounts,
p145
aV150 to 180 metric tons per year
p146
aVin the Canary Islands in Peru,
p147
aVand it's big business.
p148
aVOne gram of cochineal
p149
aVcosts about 30 euros.
p150
aVOne gram of gold
p151
aVis 30 euros.
p152
aVSo it's a very precious thing
p153
aVthat we're using to dye our foods.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow the situation in the world is going to change
p156
aVfor you and me, for everyone on this Earth.
p157
aVThe human population is growing very rapidly
p158
aVand is growing exponentially.
p159
aVWhere, at the moment, we have
p160
aVsomething between six and seven billion people,
p161
aVit will grow to about nine billion
p162
aVin 2050.
p163
aVThat means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,
p164
aVand this is something that worries more and more people.
p165
aVThere was an FAO conference last October
p166
aVthat was completely devoted to this.
p167
aVHow are we going to feed this world?
p168
aVAnd if you look at the figures up there,
p169
aVit says that we have a third more mouths to feed,
p170
aVbut we need an agricultural production increase
p171
aVof 70 percent.
p172
aVAnd that's especially because this world population
p173
aVis increasing,
p174
aVand it's increasing, not only in numbers,
p175
aVbut we're also getting wealthier,
p176
aVand anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
p177
aVand also starts to eat more meat.
p178
aVAnd meat, in fact, is something
p179
aVthat costs a lot
p180
aVof our agricultural production.
p181
aa(lp182
VOur diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,
p183
aVand at the moment, most of us here
p184
aVget it from livestock,
p185
aVfrom fish, from game.
p186
aVAnd we eat quite a lot of it.
p187
aVIn the developed world it's on average
p188
aV80 kilograms per person per year,
p189
aVwhich goes up to 120
p190
aVin the United States
p191
aVand a bit lower in some other countries,
p192
aVbut on average 80 kilograms
p193
aVper person per year.
p194
aVIn the developing world it's much lower.
p195
aVIt's 25 kilograms per person per year.
p196
aVBut it's increasing enormously.
p197
aVIn China in the last 20 years,
p198
aVit increased from 20 to 50,
p199
aVand it's still increasing.
p200
aVSo if a third of the world population
p201
aVis going to increase its meat consumption
p202
aVfrom 25 to 80 on average,
p203
aVand a third of the world population
p204
aVis living in China and in India,
p205
aVwe're having an enormous demand on meat.
p206
aVAnd of course, we are not there to say
p207
aVthat's only for us, it's not for them.
p208
aVThey have the same share that we have.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow to start with, I should say
p211
aVthat we are eating way too much meat
p212
aVin the Western world.
p213
aVWe could do with much, much less \u2014
p214
aVand I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,
p215
aVand you can easily do without anything.
p216
aVYou'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
p217
aVBut then there's a lot of problems
p218
aVthat come with meat production,
p219
aVand we're being faced with that more and more often.
p220
aVThe first problem that we're facing is human health.
p221
aVPigs are quite like us.
p222
aVThey're even models in medicine,
p223
aVand we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
p224
aVThat means that pigs also share diseases with us.
p225
aVAnd a pig disease,
p226
aVa pig virus, and a human virus
p227
aVcan both proliferate,
p228
aVand because of their kind of reproduction,
p229
aVthey can combine and produce a new virus.
p230
aVThis has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s
p231
aVduring the classical swine fever outbreak.
p232
aVYou get a new disease that can be deadly.
p233
aVWe eat insects \u2014 they're so distantly related from us
p234
aVthat this doesn't happen.
p235
aVSo that's one point for insects.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd there's the conversion factor.
p240
aVYou take 10 kilograms of feed,
p241
aVyou can get one kilogram of beef,
p242
aVbut you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
p243
aVSo if you would be an entrepreneur,
p244
aVwhat would you do?
p245
aVWith 10 kilograms of input,
p246
aVyou can get either one or nine kg. of output.
p247
aVSo far we're taking
p248
aVthe one, or up to five kilograms of output.
p249
aVWe're not taking the bonus yet.
p250
aVWe're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.
p251
aVSo that's two points for insects.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd there's the environment.
p256
aVIf we take 10 kilograms of food \u2014
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVand it results in one kilogram of beef,
p259
aVthe other nine kilograms are waste,
p260
aVand a lot of that is manure.
p261
aVIf you produce insects, you have less manure
p262
aVper kilogram of meat that you produce.
p263
aVSo less waste.
p264
aVFurthermore, per kilogram of manure,
p265
aVyou have much, much less ammonia
p266
aVand fewer greenhouse gases
p267
aVwhen you have insect manure
p268
aVthan when you have cow manure.
p269
aVSo you have less waste,
p270
aVand the waste that you have is not as environmental malign
p271
aVas it is with cow dung.
p272
aVSo that's three points for insects.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VNow there's a big "if," of course,
p277
aVand it is if insects produce meat
p278
aVthat is of good quality.
p279
aVWell there have been all kinds of analyses
p280
aVand in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,
p281
aVit's very good.
p282
aVIn fact, it's comparable
p283
aVto anything we eat as meat at the moment.
p284
aVAnd even in terms of calories, it is very good.
p285
aVOne kilogram of grasshoppers
p286
aVhas the same amount of calories
p287
aVas 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.
p288
aVSo that's four points for insects.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VI can go on,
p293
aVand I could make many more points for insects,
p294
aVbut time doesn't allow this.
p295
aVSo the question is, why not eat insects?
p296
aVI gave you at least four arguments in favor.
p297
aVWe'll have to.
p298
aVEven if you don't like it,
p299
aVyou'll have to get used to this
p300
aVbecause at the moment,
p301
aV70 percent of all our agricultural land
p302
aVis being used to produce livestock.
p303
aVThat's not only the land
p304
aVwhere the livestock is walking and feeding,
p305
aVbut it's also other areas
p306
aVwhere the feed is being produced and being transported.
p307
aVWe can increase it a bit
p308
aVat the expense of rainforests,
p309
aVbut there's a limitation very soon.
p310
aVAnd if you remember that we need to increase
p311
aVagricultural production by 70 percent,
p312
aVwe're not going to make it that way.
p313
aVWe could much better change
p314
aVfrom meat, from beef,
p315
aVto insects.
p316
aVAnd then 80 percent of the world
p317
aValready eats insects,
p318
aVso we are just a minority \u2014
p319
aVin a country like the U.K., the USA,
p320
aVthe Netherlands, anywhere.
p321
aVOn the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos
p322
aVwhere they have abundantly present
p323
aVall kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
p324
aVOn the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
p325
aVSo people there are eating them,
p326
aVnot because they're hungry,
p327
aVbut because they think it's a delicacy.
p328
aVIt's just very good food.
p329
aVYou can vary enormously.
p330
aVIt has many benefits.
p331
aa(lp332
VIn fact, we have delicacy
p333
aVthat's very much like this grasshopper:
p334
aVshrimps, a delicacy
p335
aVbeing sold at a high price.
p336
aVWho wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
p337
aVThere are a few people who don't like shrimp,
p338
aVbut shrimp, or crabs,
p339
aVor crayfish,
p340
aVare very closely related.
p341
aVThey are delicacies.
p342
aVIn fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,
p343
aVand it would make very good into our diet.
p344
aVSo why are we not eating insects yet?
p345
aVWell that's just a matter of mindset.
p346
aVWe're not used to it,
p347
aVand we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
p348
aVThat's why we're changing the perception of insects.
p349
aVAnd I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,
p350
aVin telling people what insects are,
p351
aVwhat magnificent things they are,
p352
aVwhat magnificent jobs they do in nature.
p353
aVAnd in fact, without insects,
p354
aVwe would not be here in this room,
p355
aVbecause if the insects die out,
p356
aVwe will soon die out as well.
p357
aVIf we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.
p362
aVAnd some might think, well they're not yet available.
p363
aVWell they are.
p364
aVThere are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,
p365
aVand one of them is here in the audience,
p366
aVMarian Peeters, who's in the picture.
p367
aVI predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets \u2014
p368
aVnot visible, but as animal protein
p369
aVin the food.
p370
aVAnd maybe by 2020,
p371
aVyou'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
p372
aVAnd they're being made in the most wonderful ways.
p373
aVA Dutch chocolate maker.
p374
aV(Music)
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aVSo there's even a lot of design to it.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VWell in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,
p381
aVand she puts the insects on the menu
p382
aVin her restaurant in her ministry.
p383
aVAnd when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
p384
aVover to the Hague recently,
p385
aVshe went to a high-class restaurant,
p386
aVand they ate insects all together.
p387
aVIt's not something that is a hobby of mine.
p388
aVIt's really taken off the ground.
p389
aVSo why not eat insects?
p390
aVYou should try it yourself.
p391
aVA couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together
p392
aVin a square in Wageningen town,
p393
aVand they ate insects at the same moment,
p394
aVand this was still big, big news.
p395
aVI think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,
p396
aVbecause it's just a normal way of doing.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo you can try it yourself today,
p399
aVand I would say, enjoy.
p400
aVAnd I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,
p401
aVand he can have the first bite.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VBruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.
p406
aa(lp407
VMarcel Dicke: It's all protein.
p408
aa(lp409
VBG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.
p410
aVAnd it looks delicious.
p411
aVThey just make it [with] nuts or something.
