VYou know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
p4
aVbecause I felt like I wasn't going to be able
p5
aVto make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
p6
aVIt's such a large conference.
p7
aVBut he explained to me that he was in a bind,
p8
aVand that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal
p9
aVand star power that the conference was known for.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo I said fine, Ted \u2014 I mean Chris.
p12
aVI'll come on two conditions.
p13
aVOne: I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
p14
aVAnd two: I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
p15
aVAnd luckily he agreed.
p16
aVAnd the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

p57

p59
aa(lp60
VI know this letter will come to you surprisingly,
p61
aVbut let it not be a surprise to you,
p62
aVfor nature has a way of arriving unannounced,
p63
aVand, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find,
p64
aVbut their echoes sound ouder.
p65
aVSo I decided to contact you myself,
p66
aVfor you to assure me of safety and honesty,
p67
aVif I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
p68
aVI am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura
p69
aVwho was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone

VBefore my father death,
p81
aVhe had the sum of 23 million United States dollars,
p82
aVwhich he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VThis fund was supposed to be used
p87
aVfor the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country,
p88
aVbefore the outbreak of war.
p89
aVWhen the war broke out,
p90
aVthe rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him,
p91
aVmy father insisted it was not in his possession,
p92
aVand he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
p93
aVMeanwhile, my mother and I
p94
aVis the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Sighs)
p97
aa(lp98
VI made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker,
p99
aVwho used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,
p100
aValthough he did not know the real contents of the box.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VThe fund was deposited as a family reasure,
p105
aVin a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,
p106
aVwhere I was only given temporary asylum.
p107
aVI do not wish to invest the money in Senegal
p108
aVdue to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
p109
aVThe only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me,
p110
aVare the following: one, be a silent partner
p111
aVand receive the funds in your account in trust;
p112
aVtwo, provide a bank account under your control
p113
aVto which the funds will be remitted;
p114
aVthree, receive the funds into your account in trust;
p115
aVtake out your commission; and leave the rest of the money
p116
aVuntil I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
p117
aVSincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura."

p179
aVReally cool, we were getting wasted.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced
p184
aVthat, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime,
p185
aVthey can actually predict what you are going to say \u2014
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
Vnext.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VBut they said, "No, but don't show anyone."
p196
aa(lp197
VBut they slipped up.
p198
aVAnd they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
p199
aVand my name, and it would tell me.
p200
aVAnd I have to tell you, this is an unadulterated piece of software,
p201
aVthis is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site,
p202
aVand we're going to test it out live today.
p203
aVWhat was I going to say next?
p204
aVAnd "Ze Frank" \u2014 that's me.

p226
aVOn a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips
p227
aVto 17 of my closest friends,

Vswami.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VI knew I had something.
p268
aVI'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain
p269
aVand complex philosophy, which I won't get into here,
p270
aVbecause it's a little too deep for all of you, but \u2014
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VIt's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's \u2014

V[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]
p277
aa(lp278
VIt's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
p279
aVMaybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VI'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
p284
aVFour years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day
p285
aVfrom people I don't know,
p286
aVand it's been an amazing opportunity
p287
aVto kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
p288
aVIt's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
p289
aVYou can kind of peer into other people's lives.
p290
aVAnd I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user.
p291
aVFor example, somebody wrote, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,
p292
aVyou should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"
p293
aa(lp294
V[rocking out]
p295
aa(lp296
V(Video) (Music)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,
p299
aVbut I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked."
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd that was embarrassing.
p304
aVBut you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans,
p305
aVso I said, "Sure."
p306
aa(lp307
V[rocking out naked]
p308
aa(lp309
V(Video) (Music)
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VI hear a lot of you whispering.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd I know what you're saying,
p318
aV"Holy crap!
p319
aVHow is his presentation so smooth?"
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd I have to say that it's not all me this year.
p324
aVI guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past,
p325
aVI guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED.
p326
aVI don't know.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd so, this year, Chris sent us a TED conference simulator.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VWhich really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches,
p333
aVand practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
p334
aVAnd I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Pre-recorded applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VI'd like to tell all of you a little joke.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)
p341
aa(lp342
VNot just the good stuff, though.
p343
aVYou can do heckler mode.

p346
aa(lp347

p358
aa(lp359
VIn case you run over time.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Heroic music)
p362
aa(lp363
VJust one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really \u2014
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VI'd like to thank all of you for being here.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Loud music)
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd frog mode.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Singing)
p376
aa(lp377
V(Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp \u2014"

p380
aa(lp381
V[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]
p382
aa(lp383
V(Sighs)
p384
aa(lp385
VIt's true.
p386
aVSome people say to me,
p387
aV"Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff,
p388
aVand you're not making any money."
p389
aa(lp390
V(Laughter)
p391
aa(lp392
V"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad \u2014
p393
aa(lp394
V(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
VI'm trying."
p397
aVI don't know if you're all aware of this,
p398
aVbut the video game market,
p399
aVkids are playing these video games,
p400
aVbut, supposedly, there's tons of money.
p401
aVI mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year
p402
aVis being spent on these things.
p403
aVSo I decided to try my hand.
p404
aVI came up with a few games.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VThis is called "Atheist."
p409
aVI figured it would be popular with the young kids.
p410
aVOK.
p411
aVLook, I'll move around and say some things.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Sighs)
p414
aa(lp415
V[Game over. There is no replay.]
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VSo that didn't go over so well.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Laughter)
p422
aa(lp423
VI don't really understand why you're laughing.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VShould have done this before I tried to pitch it.
p428
aV"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VBut you come back as a duck.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VAnd this is great because, you know, for a quarter,
p437
aVyou can play this for a long time.
p438
aa(lp439
V(Laughter)
p440
aa(lp441
VAnd Chris had said in an email
p442
aVthat we should really bring something new to TED,
p443
aVsomething that we haven't shown anyone.
p444
aVSo, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
p445
aVIt's the third in the series.
p446
aVI'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
p447
aa(lp448
V(Sighs)
p449
aa(lp450
V(Laughter)
p451
aa(lp452
VDo you have a preference?
p453
aa(lp454
V(Laughter)
p455
aa(lp456
VGood choice.
p457
aa(lp458
V(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VSo you can wait for the Second Coming,
p461
aa(lp462
Vwhich is a random number between one and 500 million.
p463
aa(lp464
V(Laughter)
p465
aa(lp466
VSo really, what are we talking about here?
p467
aVOh, tech joy.
p468
aa(lp469
V(Laughter)
p470
aa(lp471
VTech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
p472
aVAnd in fact, making things using technology \u2014
p473
aVand I'm being serious here,
p474
aVeven though I'm using my sarcastic voice \u2014 I won't \u2014 hold on.
p475
aVMaking things, you know \u2014
p476
aVmaking things actually does give me a lot of joy.
p477
aVIt's the process of creation that keeps me
p478
aVsort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,
p479
aVand it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project \u2014
p480
aVwhere you know you still have something to do,
p481
aVbut it's not finished, and you're not starting something \u2014
p482
aVthat really fills my entire life.
p483
aa(lp484
VAnd so, what I've done is,
p485
aa(lp486
VI started getting interested in creating online social spaces
p487
aVto share that feeling
p488
aVwith people who don't consider themselves artists.
p489
aVWe're in a culture of guru-ship.
p490
aVIt's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable,
p491
aVpeople feel like they have to read the manual.
p492
aVSo I try to create these very minimal activities
p493
aVthat allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully \u2014
p494
aa(lp495
V("The End" by The Doors)
p496
aa(lp497
VWhoa! I'm like \u2014 on the page, but it doesn't exist.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Laughter)
p500
aa(lp501
VIt's, like \u2014 seriously, though \u2014
p502
aa(lp503
V(Laughter)
p504
aa(lp505
VI try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves.
p506
aa(lp507
V(Laughter)
p508
aa(lp509
VHere I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"
p510
aVwhich, I think, really resonated with the working population.
p511
aa(lp512
V(Laughter)
p513
aa(lp514
VOver 500 entries in three weeks.
p515
aVToilet paper fashion.
p516
aa(lp517
V(Laughter)
p518
aa(lp519
VAgain, people from all over the country.
p520
aVThe watch is particularly incredible.
p521
aa(lp522
V(Laughter)
p523
aa(lp524
VOnline drawing tools \u2014 you've probably seen a lot of them.
p525
aVI think they're wonderful.
p526
aVIt's a chance for people to get to play with crayons
p527
aVand all that kind of stuff.
p528
aVBut I'm interested in the process of creating,
p529
aVas the real event that I'm interested in.
p530
aVAnd the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,
p531
aVand they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,
p532
aVawful little thing that they created.
p533
aVAnd eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
p534
aVor they draw penises and things like that.
p535
aa(lp536
V(Laughter)
p537
aa(lp538
VSo, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
p539
aVIn other words, it's a helping tool.
p540
aVYou can draw your simple stick figure,
p541
aVand it collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching.
p542
aa(lp543
V(Laughter)
p544
aa(lp545
VIn fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse.
p546
aVSo, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.
p547
aVSo the idea is that you can really,
p548
aVyou know, partake in this process,
p549
aVbut watch something really crappy look beautiful.
p550
aVAnd here are some of my favorites.
p551
aVThis is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me.
p552
aVVery cool.
p553
aa(lp554
V(Laughter)
p555
aa(lp556
VDarling.
p557
aVBeautiful stuff.
p558
aVI mean this is incredible.
p559
aVAn 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it.
p560
aVIt's just gorgeous.

aa(lp562
V(Laughter)
p563
aa(lp564
