VI'm an underwater explorer,
p4
aVmore specifically a cave diver.
p5
aa(lp6
VI wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid,
p7
aVbut growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me.
p8
aVBut as it turns out, we know a lot more about space
p9
aVthan we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet,
p10
aVthe very lifeblood of Mother Earth.
p11
aVSo I decided to do something that was even more remarkable.
p12
aVInstead of exploring outer space,
p13
aVI wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, a lot of people will tell you
p16
aVthat cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors.
p17
aVI mean, imagine yourself here in this room,
p18
aVif you were suddenly plunged into blackness,
p19
aVwith your only job to find the exit,
p20
aVsometimes swimming through these large spaces,
p21
aVand at other times crawling beneath the seats,
p22
aVfollowing a thin guideline,
p23
aVjust waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath.
p24
aVWell, that's my workplace.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut what I want to teach you today
p27
aVis that our world is not one big solid rock.
p28
aVIt's a whole lot more like a sponge.
p29
aVI can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge,
p30
aVbut where I can't,
p31
aVother life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me.
p32
aVAnd my voice is the one that's going to teach you
p33
aVabout the inside of Mother Earth.
p34
aa(lp35
VThere was no guidebook available to me
p36
aVwhen I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.
p37
aVIn 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet.
p38
aVIt calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,
p39
aVand we went down there to explore ice edge ecology
p40
aVand search for life-forms beneath the ice.
p41
aa(lp42
VWe use a technology called rebreathers.
p43
aVIt's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks.
p44
aVThis technology enables us to go deeper
p45
aVthan we could've imagined even 10 years ago.
p46
aVWe use exotic gases,
p47
aVand we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.
p48
aa(lp49
VI work with biologists.
p50
aVIt turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms,
p51
aVspecies that we never knew existed before.
p52
aVMany of these life-forms live in unusual ways.
p53
aVThey have no pigment and no eyes in many cases,
p54
aVand these animals are also extremely long-lived.
p55
aVIn fact, animals swimming in these caves today
p56
aVare identical in the fossil record
p57
aVthat predates the extinction of the dinosaurs.
p58
aVSo imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs.
p59
aVWhat can they teach us about evolution and survival?
p60
aVWhen we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar,
p61
aVhe has giant fangs with venom.
p62
aVHe can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.
p63
aVIf he were the size of a cat,
p64
aVhe'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet.
p65
aVAnd these animals live in remarkably beautiful places,
p66
aVand in some cases, caves like this, that are very young,
p67
aVyet the animals are ancient.
p68
aVHow did they get there?
p69
aa(lp70
VI also work with physicists,
p71
aVand they're interested oftentimes in global climate change.
p72
aVThey can take rocks within the caves,
p73
aVand they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks,
p74
aVmuch like the rings of a tree,
p75
aVand they can count back in history
p76
aVand learn about the climate on our planet at very different times.
p77
aVThe red that you see in this photograph
p78
aVis actually dust from the Sahara Desert.
p79
aVSo it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean.
p80
aVIt's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
p81
aVIt soaks in through the ground
p82
aVand deposits itself in the rocks within these caves.
p83
aVAnd when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times
p84
aVwhen the climate was very, very dry on earth,
p85
aVand we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.
p86
aa(lp87
VPaleoclimatologists are also interested
p88
aVin where the sea level stands were at other times on earth.
p89
aVHere in Bermuda, my team and I embarked
p90
aVon the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region,
p91
aVand we were looking for places
p92
aVwhere the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline,
p93
aVmany hundreds of feet below current levels.
p94
aa(lp95
VI also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists.
p96
aVIn places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,
p97
aVwe're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves,
p98
aVand they tell us a lot
p99
aVabout some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago,
p102
aVwhen I was a part of the team that made the very first
p103
aVaccurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface.
p104
aVThis device that I'm driving through the cave
p105
aVwas actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it.
p106
aVWe also used ultra low frequency radio
p107
aVto broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave.
p108
aVSo I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses,
p109
aVand even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
p110
aa(lp111
VPretty remarkable, and what that taught me
p112
aVwas that everything we do on the surface of our earth
p113
aVwill be returned to us to drink.
p114
aVOur water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans,
p115
aVbut it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together.
p116
aVIt's a shared resource from which we all drink.
p117
aVAnd when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater
p118
aVand all of our water resources on this planet,
p119
aVthen we'll be working on the problem
p120
aVthat's probably the most important issue of this century.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be,
p123
aVbut this mapping device, designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.
p124
aVIt's actually morphed.
p125
aVIt's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,
p126
aVartificially intelligent,
p127
aVand its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa
p128
aVand explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd that's pretty amazing.
