VI'm a visual artist,
p4
aVand I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
p5
aVI've been working with plastic bags,
p6
aVwhich I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork
p7
aVfor the last 20 years.
p8
aVI turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces
p9
aVand sculptures and installations.
p10
aVUpon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,
p11
aVsome of my work started to fissure
p12
aVand break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
p13
aVAnd I thought, "Great.
p14
aVIt's ephemeral just like us."
p15
aa(lp16
VUpon educating myself a little further about plastics,
p17
aVI actually realized this was a bad thing.
p18
aVIt's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,
p19
aVbecause it's always still plastic.
p20
aVAnd what we're finding
p21
aVis that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
p22
aVI then, in the last few years,
p23
aVlearned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
p24
aVAnd my initial reaction \u2014
p25
aVand I think this is a lot of people's first reaction
p26
aVto learning about it \u2014
p27
aVis, "Oh my God!
p28
aVWe've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
p29
aVSo I actually developed a proposal
p30
aVto go out with a cargo ship
p31
aVand two decommissioned fishing trawlers,
p32
aVa crane, a chipping machine
p33
aVand a cold-molding machine.
p34
aVAnd my intention was to go out to the gyre,
p35
aVraise awareness about this issue
p36
aVand begin to pick up the plastic,
p37
aVchip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks
p38
aVthat could potentially be used as building materials
p39
aVin underdeveloped communities.
p40
aa(lp41
VI began talking with people
p42
aVwho actually had been out to the gyre
p43
aVand were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
p44
aVand upon doing so,
p45
aVI realized actually that cleaning it up
p46
aVwould be a very small drop in the bucket
p47
aVrelative to how much is being generated
p48
aVevery day around the world,
p49
aVand that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
p50
aVAnd the bigger picture is:
p51
aVwe need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
p52
aVWe need to cut the spigot
p53
aVof single-use and disposable plastics,
p54
aVwhich are entering the marine environment every day
p55
aVon a global scale.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
p58
aVI wasn't just concerned about plastic
p59
aVthat you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean \u2014
p60
aVof which I have learned there are now
p61
aV11 gyres, potentially, of plastic
p62
aVin five major oceans in the world.
p63
aVIt's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about \u2014
p64
aVit's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
p65
aVI'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
p66
aVAll of my beverages are packaged in plastic,
p67
aVeven at the health food market.
p68
aVI'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,
p69
aVand I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic
p70
aVinto us and into our bodies.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo I came together with a group of other people
p73
aVwho were all looking at this issue,
p74
aVand we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
p75
aVWe have many initiatives that we're working on,
p76
aVbut some of them are very basic.
p77
aVOne is: if 80 to 90 percent
p78
aVof what we're finding in the ocean \u2014
p79
aVof the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean \u2014 is plastic,
p80
aVthen why don't we call it what it is.
p81
aVIt's plastic pollution.
p82
aVRecycling \u2014 everybody kind of ends their books
p83
aVabout being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
p84
aVYou put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
p85
aVWhat is the reality of that?
p86
aVIn the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
p87
aVAnd if you really look into it,
p88
aVparticularly when it comes to plastic bottles,
p89
aVmost of it is only down-cycled,
p90
aVor incinerated, or shipped to China.
p91
aVIt is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,
p92
aVwhile a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again
p93
aVor can be used again \u2014
p94
aVa plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo this is a big issue for us.
p97
aVAnother thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about
p98
aVis we've added a fourth R
p99
aVonto the front
p100
aVof the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,
p101
aVand that is refuse.
p102
aVWhenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
p103
aVAlternatives exist;
p104
aVsome of them are very old-school.
p105
aVI myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers
p106
aVand using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers
p107
aVto store food in.
p108
aVAnd I know that I am doing a service
p109
aVto myself and my family.
p110
aVIt's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle
p111
aVor a glass bottle,
p112
aVif you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle
p113
aVand fill that up with water or filtered water,
p114
aVversus purchasing plastic bottled water.
p115
aa(lp116
VI guess what I want to say to everybody here \u2014
p117
aVand I know that you guys know a lot about this issue \u2014
p118
aVis that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
p119
aVbut this is a problem that we've created as consumers
p120
aVand we can solve.
p121
aVWe can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
p122
aVand teaching people to choose alternatives.
p123
aVSo whenever possible, to choose alternatives
p124
aVto single-use plastics.
p125
aVWe can cut the stem \u2014 tide the stem of this
p126
aVinto our oceans
p127
aVand in doing so,
p128
aVsave our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
