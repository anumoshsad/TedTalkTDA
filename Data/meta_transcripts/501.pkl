VNewspapers are dying for a few reasons.
p4
aVReaders don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.
p5
aVYour iPhone, your laptop,
p6
aVis much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.
p7
aVAnd we should save trees in the end.
p8
aVSo it's enough to bury any industry.
p9
aVSo, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"
p10
aa(lp11
VThere are several scenarios for the future newspaper.
p12
aVSome people say it should be free;
p13
aVit should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;
p14
aVit should be local, run by communities,
p15
aVor niche, for some smaller groups like business \u2014
p16
aVbut then it's not free; it's very expensive.
p17
aVIt should be opinion-driven;
p18
aVless news, more views.
p19
aVAnd we'd rather read it during breakfast,
p20
aVbecause later we listen to radio in a car,
p21
aVcheck your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.
p22
aVSounds nice, but this can only buy time.
p23
aVBecause in the long run,
p24
aVI think there is no reason, no practical reason
p25
aVfor newspapers to survive.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo what can we do?
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVLet me tell you my story.
p30
aV20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,
p31
aVstarted to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.
p32
aVAfter a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.
p33
aVThey were run by an inexperienced staff,
p34
aVwith no visual culture, no budgets for visuals \u2014
p35
aVin many places there were not even art directors.
p36
aVI decided to be \u2014 to work for them as an art director.
p37
aVBefore, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,
p38
aV"What are you doing for a living?"
p39
aVI said, "I'm designing newspapers."
p40
aV"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVAnd she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.
p43
aa(lp44
VI came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
p45
aVAnd I had a revelation. I thought,
p46
aV"These guys took some creepy,
p47
aVrun-down entertainment,
p48
aVand put it to the highest possible level of performance art."
p49
aVI thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."
p50
aVAnd I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.
p51
aVThe front page became our signature.
p52
aVIt was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.
p53
aa(lp54
VI'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.
p55
aVMy approach was very egotistic.
p56
aVI wanted my artistic statement,
p57
aVmy interpretation of reality.
p58
aVI wanted to make posters, not newspapers.
p59
aVNot even magazines: posters.
p60
aVWe were experimenting with type,
p61
aVwith illustration, with photos. And we had fun.
p62
aVSoon it started to bring results.
p63
aVIn Poland, our pages were named
p64
aV"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.
p65
aVOther examples you can see here are from
p66
aVLatvia, Lithuania, Estonia \u2014
p67
aVthe central European countries.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut it's not only about the front page.
p70
aVThe secret is that we were treating
p71
aVthe whole newspaper as one piece,
p72
aVas one composition \u2014 like music.
p73
aVAnd music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.
p74
aVAnd design is responsible for this experience.
p75
aVFlipping through pages is readers experience,
p76
aVand I'm responsible for this experience.
p77
aVWe treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,
p78
aVbecause that's how readers perceive it.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou can see some Russian pages here which got many awards
p81
aVon biggest infographic competition in Spain.
p82
aVBut the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.
p83
aVJust a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,
p84
aVthey name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.
p85
aVAnd two years later,
p86
aVthe same award came to Estonia.
p87
aVIsn't amazing?
p88
aa(lp89
VWhat really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers
p90
aVwere growing too.
p91
aVJust some examples:
p92
aVin Russia, plus 11 after one year,
p93
aVplus 29 after three years of the redesign.
p94
aVSame in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent
p95
aVraise of circulation after three years.
p96
aVYou can see on a graph,
p97
aVafter years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,
p98
aVjust after redesign.
p99
aVBut the real hit was in Bulgaria.
p100
aVAnd that is really amazing.
p101
aa(lp102
VDid design do this?
p103
aVDesign was just a part of the process.
p104
aVAnd the process we made was not about changing the look,
p105
aVit was about improving the product completely.
p106
aVI took an architectural rule about function and form
p107
aVand translated it into newspaper content and design.
p108
aVAnd I put strategy at the top of it.
p109
aVSo first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?
p110
aVThen we adjust the content accordingly.
p111
aVAnd then, usually after two months, we start designing.
p112
aVMy bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.
p113
aVWhy am I asking all of these business questions,
p114
aVinstead of just showing them pages?
p115
aVBut soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:
p116
aVto be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo what is the lesson behind it?
p119
aVThe first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.
p120
aVIt can change your workflow \u2014 actually, it can change everything in your company;
p121
aVit can turn your company upside down.
p122
aVIt can even change you.
p123
aVAnd who's responsible? Designers.
p124
aVGive power to designers.
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aVBut the second is even more important.
p127
aVYou can live in a small poor country, like me.
p128
aVYou can work for a small company,
p129
aVin a boring branch.
p130
aVYou can have no budgets, no people \u2014
p131
aVbut still can put your work to the highest possible level.
p132
aVAnd everybody can do it.
p133
aVYou just need inspiration, vision and determination.
p134
aVAnd you need to remember that to be good
p135
aVis not enough.
p136
aa(lp137
