VI'm here to spread the word about the
p4
aVmagnificence of spiders
p5
aVand how much we can learn from them.
p6
aVSpiders are truly global citizens.
p7
aVYou can find spiders in nearly
p8
aVevery terrestrial habitat.
p9
aVThis red dot marks
p10
aVthe Great Basin of North America,
p11
aVand I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity
p12
aVproject there with some collaborators.
p13
aVHere's one of our field sites,
p14
aVand just to give you a sense of perspective,
p15
aVthis little blue smudge here,
p16
aVthat's one of my collaborators.
p17
aVThis is a rugged and barren landscape,
p18
aVyet there are quite a few spiders here.
p19
aVTurning rocks over revealed this crab spider
p20
aVgrappling with a beetle.
p21
aa(lp22
VSpiders are not just everywhere,
p23
aVbut they're extremely diverse.
p24
aVThere are over 40,000 described species
p25
aVof spiders.
p26
aVTo put that number into perspective,
p27
aVhere's a graph comparing the 40,000
p28
aVspecies of spiders
p29
aVto the 400 species of primates.
p30
aVThere are two orders of magnitude more
p31
aVspiders than primates.
p32
aVSpiders are also extremely old.
p33
aVOn the bottom here,
p34
aVthis is the geologic timescale,
p35
aVand the numbers on it indicate millions
p36
aVof years from the present, so the zero here,
p37
aVthat would be today.
p38
aVSo what this figure shows is that spiders
p39
aVdate back to almost 380 million years.
p40
aVTo put that into perspective, this red
p41
aVvertical bar here marks the divergence time
p42
aVof humans from chimpanzees,
p43
aVa mere seven million years ago.
p44
aa(lp45
VAll spiders make silk
p46
aVat some point in their life.
p47
aVMost spiders use copious amounts of silk,
p48
aVand silk is essential to their survival
p49
aVand reproduction.
p50
aVEven fossil spiders can make silk,
p51
aVas we can see from this impression of
p52
aVa spinneret on this fossil spider.
p53
aVSo this means that both spiders
p54
aVand spider silk have been around
p55
aVfor 380 million years.
p56
aVIt doesn't take long from working with spiders
p57
aVto start noticing how essential silk is
p58
aVto just about every aspect of their life.
p59
aVSpiders use silk for many purposes, including
p60
aVthe trailing safety dragline,
p61
aVwrapping eggs for reproduction,
p62
aVprotective retreats
p63
aVand catching prey.
p64
aa(lp65
VThere are many kinds of spider silk.
p66
aVFor example, this garden spider can make
p67
aVseven different kinds of silks.
p68
aVWhen you look at this orb web, you're actually
p69
aVseeing many types of silk fibers.
p70
aVThe frame and radii of this web
p71
aVis made up of one type of silk,
p72
aVwhile the capture spiral is a composite
p73
aVof two different silks:
p74
aVthe filament and the sticky droplet.
p75
aVHow does an individual spider
p76
aVmake so many kinds of silk?
p77
aVTo answer that, you have to look a lot closer
p78
aVat the spinneret region of a spider.
p79
aVSo silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for
p80
aVthose of us spider silk biologists, this is what
p81
aVwe call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter)
p82
aVWe spend long days ...
p83
aVHey! Don't laugh. That's my life.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVWe spend long days and nights
p86
aVstaring at this part of the spider.
p87
aVAnd this is what we see.
p88
aVYou can see multiple fibers
p89
aVcoming out of the spinnerets, because
p90
aVeach spinneret has many spigots on it.
p91
aVEach of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,
p92
aVand if you were to trace the fiber back
p93
aVinto the spider, what you would find is that
p94
aVeach spigot connects to its own individual
p95
aVsilk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac
p96
aVwith a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.
p97
aVSo if you ever have the opportunity to dissect
p98
aVan orb-web-weaving spider,
p99
aVand I hope you do,
p100
aVwhat you would find is a bounty
p101
aVof beautiful, translucent silk glands.
p102
aa(lp103
VInside each spider, there are hundreds
p104
aVof silk glands, sometimes thousands.
p105
aVThese can be grouped into seven categories.
p106
aVThey differ by size, shape,
p107
aVand sometimes even color.
p108
aVIn an orb-web-weaving spider,
p109
aVyou can find seven types of silk glands,
p110
aVand what I have depicted here in this picture,
p111
aVlet's start at the one o'clock position,
p112
aVthere's tubuliform silk glands, which are used
p113
aVto make the outer silk of an egg sac.
p114
aVThere's the aggregate and flagelliform silk
p115
aVglands which combine to make the sticky
p116
aVcapture spiral of an orb web.
p117
aVPyriform silk glands make the attachment
p118
aVcement \u2014 that's the silk that's used to adhere
p119
aVsilk lines to a substrate.
p120
aVThere's also aciniform silk,
p121
aVwhich is used to wrap prey.
p122
aVMinor ampullate silk is used in web construction.
p123
aVAnd the most studied silk line
p124
aVof them all: major ampullate silk.
p125
aVThis is the silk that's used to make the frame
p126
aVand radii of an orb web, and also
p127
aVthe safety trailing dragline.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut what, exactly, is spider silk?
p130
aVSpider silk is almost entirely protein.
p131
aVNearly all of these proteins can be explained
p132
aVby a single gene family,
p133
aVso this means that the diversity of silk types
p134
aVwe see today is encoded by one gene family,
p135
aVso presumably the original spider ancestor
p136
aVmade one kind of silk,
p137
aVand over the last 380 million years,
p138
aVthat one silk gene has duplicated
p139
aVand then diverged, specialized,
p140
aVover and over and over again, to get
p141
aVthe large variety of flavors of spider silks
p142
aVthat we have today.
p143
aVThere are several features that all these silks
p144
aVhave in common. They all have a common
p145
aVdesign, such as they're all very long \u2014
p146
aVthey're sort of outlandishly long
p147
aVcompared to other proteins.
p148
aVThey're very repetitive, and they're very rich
p149
aVin the amino acids glycine and alanine.
p150
aVTo give you an idea of what
p151
aVa spider silk protein looks like,
p152
aVthis is a dragline silk protein,
p153
aVit's just a portion of it,
p154
aVfrom the black widow spider.
p155
aVThis is the kind of sequence that I love
p156
aVlooking at day and night. (Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VSo what you're seeing here is the one letter
p159
aVabbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored
p160
aVin the glycines with green,
p161
aVand the alanines in red, and so
p162
aVyou can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.
p163
aVYou can also see that there's a lot of short
p164
aVsequence motifs that repeat over and over
p165
aVand over again, so for example there's a lot of
p166
aVwhat we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,
p167
aVAAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.
p168
aVYou can think of these short motifs
p169
aVthat repeat over and over again as words,
p170
aVand these words occur in sentences.
p171
aVSo for example this would be one sentence,
p172
aVand you would get this sort of green region
p173
aVand the red polyalanine, that repeats
p174
aVover and over and over again,
p175
aVand you can have that hundreds and
p176
aVhundreds and hundreds of times within
p177
aVan individual silk molecule.
p178
aa(lp179
VSilks made by the same spider can have
p180
aVdramatically different repeat sequences.
p181
aVAt the top of the screen, you're seeing
p182
aVthe repeat unit from the dragline silk
p183
aVof a garden argiope spider.
p184
aVIt's short. And on the bottom,
p185
aVthis is the repeat sequence for the
p186
aVegg case, or tubuliform silk protein,
p187
aVfor the exact same spider. And you can see
p188
aVhow dramatically different
p189
aVthese silk proteins are \u2014 so this is
p190
aVsort of the beauty of the diversification
p191
aVof the spider silk gene family.
p192
aVYou can see that the repeat units differ
p193
aVin length. They also differ in sequence.
p194
aVSo I've colored in the glycines again
p195
aVin green, alanine in red, and the serines,
p196
aVthe letter S, in purple. And you can see
p197
aVthat the top repeat unit can be explained
p198
aValmost entirely by green and red,
p199
aVand the bottom repeat unit has
p200
aVa substantial amount of purple.
p201
aVWhat silk biologists do is we try to relate
p202
aVthese sequences, these amino acid
p203
aVsequences, to the mechanical properties
p204
aVof the silk fibers.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk
p207
aVcompletely outside their body.
p208
aVThis makes testing spider silk really, really
p209
aVeasy to do in the laboratory, because
p210
aVwe're actually, you know, testing it in air
p211
aVthat's exactly the environment that
p212
aVspiders are using their silk proteins.
p213
aVSo this makes quantifying silk properties by
p214
aVmethods such as tensile testing, which is
p215
aVbasically, you know, tugging on one end
p216
aVof the fiber, very amenable.
p217
aVHere are stress-strain curves
p218
aVgenerated by tensile testing
p219
aVfive fibers made by the same spider.
p220
aVSo what you can see here is that
p221
aVthe five fibers have different behaviors.
p222
aVSpecifically, if you look on the vertical axis,
p223
aVthat's stress. If you look at the maximum
p224
aVstress value for each of these fibers,
p225
aVyou can see that there's a lot of variation,
p226
aVand in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,
p227
aVis the strongest of these fibers.
p228
aVWe think that's because the dragline silk,
p229
aVwhich is used to make the frame and radii
p230
aVfor a web, needs to be very strong.
p231
aa(lp232
VOn the other hand, if you were to look at
p233
aVstrain \u2014 this is how much a fiber can be
p234
aVextended \u2014 if you look at the maximum value
p235
aVhere, again, there's a lot of variation
p236
aVand the clear winner is flagelliform,
p237
aVor the capture spiral filament.
p238
aVIn fact, this flagelliform fiber can
p239
aVactually stretch over twice its original length.
p240
aVSo silk fibers vary in their strength
p241
aVand also their extensibility.
p242
aVIn the case of the capture spiral,
p243
aVit needs to be so stretchy to absorb
p244
aVthe impact of flying prey.
p245
aVIf it wasn't able to stretch so much, then
p246
aVbasically when an insect hit the web,
p247
aVit would just trampoline right off of it.
p248
aVSo if the web was made entirely out of
p249
aVdragline silk, an insect is very likely to just
p250
aVbounce right off. But by having really, really
p251
aVstretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually
p252
aVable to absorb the impact
p253
aVof that intercepted prey.
p254
aa(lp255
VThere's quite a bit of variation within
p256
aVthe fibers that an individual spider can make.
p257
aVWe call that the tool kit of a spider.
p258
aVThat's what the spider has
p259
aVto interact with their environment.
p260
aVBut how about variation among spider
p261
aVspecies, so looking at one type of silk
p262
aVand looking at different species of spiders?
p263
aVThis is an area that's largely unexplored
p264
aVbut here's a little bit of data I can show you.
p265
aVThis is the comparison of the toughness
p266
aVof the dragline spilk spun
p267
aVby 21 species of spiders.
p268
aVSome of them are orb-weaving spiders and
p269
aVsome of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.
p270
aVIt's been hypothesized that
p271
aVorb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,
p272
aVshould have the toughest dragline silks
p273
aVbecause they must intercept flying prey.
p274
aVWhat you see here on this toughness graph
p275
aVis the higher the black dot is on the graph,
p276
aVthe higher the toughness.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe 21 species are indicated here by this
p279
aVphylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows
p280
aVtheir genetic relationships, and I've colored
p281
aVin yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.
p282
aVIf you look right here at the two red arrows,
p283
aVthey point to the toughness values
p284
aVfor the draglines of nephila clavipes and
p285
aVaraneus diadematus.
p286
aVThese are the two species of spiders
p287
aVfor which the vast majority of time and money
p288
aVon synthetic spider silk research has been
p289
aVto replicate their dragline silk proteins.
p290
aVYet, their draglines are not the toughest.
p291
aVIn fact, the toughest dragline in this survey
p292
aVis this one right here in this white region,
p293
aVa non orb-web-weaving spider.
p294
aVThis is the dragline spun by scytodes,
p295
aVthe spitting spider.
p296
aVScytodes doesn't use a web at all
p297
aVto catch prey. Instead, scytodes
p298
aVsort of lurks around and waits for prey
p299
aVto get close to it, and then immobilizes prey
p300
aVby spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.
p301
aVThink of hunting with silly string.
p302
aVThat's how scytodes forages.
p303
aVWe don't really know why scytodes
p304
aVneeds such a tough dragline,
p305
aVbut it's unexpected results like this that make
p306
aVbio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.
p307
aVIt frees us from the constraints
p308
aVof our imagination.
p309
aa(lp310
VNow I'm going to mark on
p311
aVthe toughness values for nylon fiber,
p312
aVbombyx \u2014 or domesticated silkworm silk \u2014
p313
aVwool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.
p314
aVAnd what you can see is that nearly
p315
aVall the spider draglines surpass them.
p316
aVIt's the combination of strength, extensibility
p317
aVand toughness that makes spider silk so
p318
aVspecial, and that has attracted the attention
p319
aVof biomimeticists, so people that turn
p320
aVto nature to try to find new solutions.
p321
aVAnd the strength, extensibility and toughness
p322
aVof spider silks combined with the fact that
p323
aVsilks do not elicit an immune response,
p324
aVhave attracted a lot of interest in the use
p325
aVof spider silks in biomedical applications,
p326
aVfor example, as a component of
p327
aVartificial tendons, for serving as
p328
aVguides to regrow nerves, and for
p329
aVscaffolds for tissue growth.
p330
aa(lp331
VSpider silks also have a lot of potential
p332
aVfor their anti-ballistic capabilities.
p333
aVSilks could be incorporated into body
p334
aVand equipment armor that would be more
p335
aVlightweight and flexible
p336
aVthan any armor available today.
p337
aVIn addition to these biomimetic
p338
aVapplications of spider silks,
p339
aVpersonally, I find studying spider silks
p340
aVjust fascinating in and of itself.
p341
aVI love when I'm in the laboratory,
p342
aVa new spider silk sequence comes in.
p343
aVThat's just the best. (Laughter)
p344
aVIt's like the spiders are sharing
p345
aVan ancient secret with me, and that's why
p346
aVI'm going to spend the rest of my life
p347
aVstudying spider silk.
p348
aVThe next time you see a spider web,
p349
aVplease, pause and look a little closer.
p350
aVYou'll be seeing one of the most
p351
aVhigh-performance materials known to man.
p352
aVTo borrow from the writings
p353
aVof a spider named Charlotte,
p354
aVsilk is terrific.
p355
