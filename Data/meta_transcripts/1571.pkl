VI have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
p4
aVI understand we have over 80 countries here,
p5
aVso that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak
p6
aVto all of these countries.
p7
aa(lp8
VIn each country, I'm sure you have this thing called
p9
aVthe parent-teacher conference.
p10
aVDo you know about the parent-teacher conference?
p11
aVNot the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,
p12
aVwhere your parents come to school and your teacher
p13
aVtalks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.
p14
aVWell, I remember in third grade, I had this moment
p15
aVwhere my father, who never takes off from work,
p16
aVhe's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person,
p17
aVgoing to school to see his son, how he's doing,
p18
aVand the teacher said to him, he said, "You know,
p19
aVJohn is good at math and art."
p20
aVAnd he kind of nodded, you know?
p21
aVThe next day I saw him talking to a customer at our
p22
aVtofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd that always stuck with me all my life.
p26
aVWhy didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
p27
aVWhy? It became a question my entire life, and
p28
aVthat's all right, because being good at math meant
p29
aVhe bought me a computer, and some of you remember
p30
aVthis computer, this was my first computer.
p31
aVWho had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause)
p32
aVAs you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter)
p33
aVYou'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
p34
aVIt would say you're wrong most of the time.
p35
aVThat was the computer we knew.
p36
aVThat computer is a computer that I learned about
p37
aVgoing to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,
p38
aVI learned about the computer at all levels,
p39
aVand after, I went to art school to get away from computers,
p40
aVand I began to think about the computer as more of
p41
aVa spiritual space of thinking.
p42
aVAnd I was influenced by performance art \u2014
p43
aVso this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.
p44
aVIt was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.
p45
aVI have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc.,
p46
aVand I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
p47
aVIt's a room broken in two halves.
p48
aVI've turned the computer on,
p49
aVand these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk
p50
aVbuilt out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
p51
aVAnd the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter)
p52
aVShe finds the first sector on the disk, and
p53
aVtakes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
p54
aVSo the bus diligently carries the data into the computer
p55
aVto the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc.,
p56
aVand it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter)
p57
aVAnd it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,
p58
aVwhere it's XY. (Laughter)
p59
aVIt looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually
p60
aVa very slow computer, and when I realized how slow
p61
aVthis computer was compared to how fast a computer is,
p62
aVit made me wonder about computers and technology in general.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
p65
aVThe first three things are about how I've been curious
p66
aVabout technology, design and art, and how they intersect,
p67
aVhow they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on
p68
aVsince four years ago I became the President
p69
aVof Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.
p70
aVAnd I'll talk about how I've looked to combine
p71
aVthese four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo starting from technology,
p74
aVtechnology is a wonderful thing.
p75
aVWhen that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
p76
aVIt could show text and
p77
aVafter we waited a bit, we had these things called images.
p78
aVRemember when images were first possible with a computer,
p79
aVthose gorgeous, full-color images?
p80
aVAnd then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
p81
aVIt was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.
p82
aVAnd then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.
p83
aVRemember that excitement?
p84
aVAnd then the browser appeared. The browser was great,
p85
aVbut the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.
p86
aVText first, then images, we waited,
p87
aVCD-quality sound over the Net,
p88
aVthen movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.
p89
aVAnd then the mobile phone occurred,
p90
aVtext, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone,
p91
aViPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.
p92
aVYou see this little pattern here?
p93
aVWe're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense
p94
aVof possibility from computing is something I've been
p95
aVquestioning for the last 10 or so years,
p96
aVand have looked to design, as we understand most things,
p97
aVand to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
p98
aVAnd I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.
p99
aa(lp100
VDesigners talk about the relationship between form
p101
aVand content, content and form. Now what does that mean?
p102
aVWell, content is the word up there: fear.
p103
aVIt's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.
p104
aVFear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful,
p105
aVand if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica,
p106
aVit's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right? (Laughter)
p107
aVYou take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big,
p108
aVand like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.
p109
aVSo you can see how you change the scale, you change
p110
aVthe form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.
p111
aVYou change the typeface to, like, this typeface,
p112
aVand it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,
p113
aVlike Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!
p114
aVLike, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.
p115
aVOr fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter)
p116
aVLike, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)
p117
aVIt's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)
p118
aVIt just changes the same content.
p119
aVOr you make it \u2014 The letters are separated apart,
p120
aVthey're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,
p121
aVand you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
p122
aVYou feel for them.
p123
aVOr you change the typeface to something like this.
p124
aVIt's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.
p125
aVI can never get in there. (Laughter)
p126
aVIt's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.
p127
aa(lp128
VIf you just change one letter in that content,
p129
aVyou get a much better word, much better content: free.
p130
aV"Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way.
p131
aVFree bold feels like Mandela free.
p132
aVIt's like, yes, I can be free.
p133
aVFree even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
p134
aVIt feels great. Or even free spread out,
p135
aVit's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.
p136
aVAnd I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,
p137
aVand I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter)
p138
aVSo you see that \u2014 form, content, design, it works that way.
p139
aVIt's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost,
p140
aVlike the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.
p141
aVDesign does that.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd I've been curious about how design and technology intersect,
p144
aVand I'm going to show you some old work I never really
p145
aVshow anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.
p146
aVSo \u2014 yeah.
p147
aVSo I made a lot of work in the '90s.
p148
aVThis was a square that responds to sound.
p149
aVPeople ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)
p150
aVBut I thought it'd be neat for the square
p151
aVto respond to me, and my kids were small then,
p152
aVand my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah,"
p153
aVyou know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that.
p154
aVWe'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
p155
aVAnd they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"
p156
aVAnd it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
p157
aVSo I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd then I spent a lot of time in the space of
p160
aVinteractive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because
p161
aVmy students at MIT got so much better than myself,
p162
aVso I had to hang up my mouse.
p163
aVBut in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,
p164
aVmonochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
p165
aVIt's called "Tap, Type, Write."
p166
aVIt's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter
p167
aVthat my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
p168
aVIt has 10 variations. (Typing noise)
p169
aV(Typing noise)
p170
aVThere's a shift.
p171
aVTen variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.
p172
aV(Typing noises)
p173
aVThis is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises)
p174
aVThis is 20 years old, so it's kind of a \u2014
p175
aVLet's see, this is \u2014
p176
aVI love the French film "The Red Balloon."
p177
aVGreat movie, right? I love that movie. So,
p178
aVthis is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)
p179
aVIt's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)
p180
aVI'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.
p181
aVIt's kind of stressful typing out, so if you
p182
aVtype on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVIf you hit G, life's okay, so I always say,
p185
aV"Hit G, and it's going to be all right.
p186
aVThank you. (Applause)
p187
aVThank you.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo that was 20 years ago, and
p190
aVI was always on the periphery of art.
p191
aVBy being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,
p192
aVand art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
p193
aVYou know, when people say, "I don't get art.
p194
aVI don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
p195
aVIt's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say,
p196
aVlike, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great. (Laughter)
p197
aVArt does that, because art is about asking questions,
p198
aVquestions that may not be answerable.
p199
aa(lp200
VAt RISD, we have this amazing facility called
p201
aVthe Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples
p202
aVof animal, bone, mineral, plants.
p203
aVYou know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,
p204
aVthey call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd why do we have this facility?
p207
aVBecause at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,
p208
aVthe object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
p209
aVAt RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
p210
aVAnd many people ask me, John, couldn't you just
p211
aVdigitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
p212
aVAnd I often say, well, there's something good to how things
p213
aVused to be done. There's something very different about it,
p214
aVsomething we should figure out what is good about
p215
aVhow we did it, even in this new era.
p216
aVAnd I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named
p217
aVTota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo,
p218
aVbut when he was based in London, he had a game
p219
aVwith his wife. He would go to antique shops,
p220
aVand the game was as such:
p221
aVWhen we look at an antique we want,
p222
aVwe'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique,
p223
aVand if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
p224
aVSo they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup,
p225
aVand they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
p226
aVAnd the shopkeeper would say, "It's old." (Laughter)
p227
aV"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old." (Laughter)
p228
aVAnd he saw, over and over, the antique's value
p229
aVwas all about it being old.
p230
aVAnd as a new media artist, he reflected, and said,
p231
aVyou know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
p232
aVPeople say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media.
p233
aVAnd he realized, it isn't about old or new.
p234
aVIt's about something in between.
p235
aVIt isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good.
p236
aVA combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.
p237
aVYou see it in all interesting art today, in all
p238
aVinteresting businesses today. How we combine
p239
aVthose two together to make good is very interesting.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo art makes questions, and
p242
aVleadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
p243
aVWe aren't functioning so easily anymore.
p244
aVWe aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
p245
aVAs an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time
p246
aVtraveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument,
p247
aVand I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass,"
p248
aVand I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English,
p249
aVand you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
p250
aVBut I found a sign for Russian-speaking people,
p251
aVand it was the best sign ever to say no.
p252
aVIt was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
p253
aVMy favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.
p254
aVAnd also "no love." (Laughter)
p255
aVSo that is authoritarianism.
p256
aVAnd what is that, structurally?
p257
aVIt's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run
p258
aVmany systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.
p259
aVIt is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
p260
aVIt's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd so today, leaders are faced
p263
aVwith how to lead differently, I believe.
p264
aVThis is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont
p265
aVon creative leadership. What can we learn
p266
aVfrom artists and designers for how to lead?
p267
aVBecause in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.
p268
aVSomeone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
p269
aVA traditional leader is always wanting to be right,
p270
aVwhereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
p271
aVAnd this frame is important today, in this complex,
p272
aVambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd I had a show in London recently where my friends
p275
aVinvited me to come to London for four days
p276
aVto sit in a sandbox, and I said great.
p277
aVAnd so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight,
p278
aVsix hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London,
p279
aVand that was really bad.
p280
aVBut I would listen to people, hear their issues,
p281
aVdraw in the sand, try to figure things out,
p282
aVand it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
p283
aVYou know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.
p284
aVAnd it felt kind of like being president, actually.
p285
aVI was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"
p286
aVAnd by the end of the experience,
p287
aVI realized why I was doing this.
p288
aVIt's because leaders, what we do is we connect
p289
aVimprobable connections and hope something will happen,
p290
aVand in that room I found so many connections
p291
aVbetween people across all of London, and so leadership,
p292
aVconnecting people, is the great question today.
p293
aVWhether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,
p294
aVit's a wonderful design challenge.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd one thing I've been doing is doing some research
p297
aVon systems that can combine technology and leadership
p298
aVwith an art and design perspective.
p299
aVLet me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.
p300
aVSo what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch
p301
aVI wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?
p302
aVThis is called Powershop, and the way it works is
p303
aVimagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever
p304
aVat the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.
p305
aVThere may be different subdivisions in the organization,
p306
aVand you might want to look into different areas. For instance,
p307
aVgreen are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.
p308
aVYou know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,
p309
aVmake things happen? So for instance, you might open up
p310
aVa distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there,
p311
aVand know that you know someone in Eco, over here,
p312
aVand
p313
aVthese people here are in Eco, the people you might
p314
aVengage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.
p315
aVAnd part of the challenge of the CEO is to find
p316
aVconnections across areas, and so you might look in R&D,
p317
aVand here you see one person who crosses the two areas
p318
aVof interest, and it's a person important to engage.
p319
aVSo you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display
p320
aVon how you're interacting with them.
p321
aVHow many coffees do you have?
p322
aVHow often are you calling them, emailing them?
p323
aVWhat is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?
p324
aVLeaders might be able to use these systems to
p325
aVbetter regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.
p326
aVYou can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,
p327
aVthe guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep
p328
aVtext analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?
p329
aa(lp330
VSo these kind of systems, I believe, are important.
p331
aVThey're targeted social media systems around leaders.
p332
aVAnd I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin
p333
aVto grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,
p334
aVbecause art and design lets you think like this,
p335
aVfind different systems like this,
p336
aVand I've just begun thinking like this,
p337
aVso I'm glad to share that with you.
p338
aVSo in closing, I want to thank all of you
p339
aVfor your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause)
