VThis is what my last week looked like.
p4
aVWhat I did,
p5
aVwho I was with,
p6
aVthe main sensations I had for every waking hour ...
p7
aVIf the feeling came as I thought of my dad
p8
aVwho recently passed away,
p9
aVor if I could have just definitely avoided the worries and anxieties.
p10
aVAnd if you think I'm a little obsessive,
p11
aVyou're probably right.
p12
aVBut clearly, from this visualization,
p13
aVyou can learn much more about me than from this other one,
p14
aVwhich are images you're probably more familiar with
p15
aVand which you possibly even have on your phone right now.
p16
aVBar charts for the steps you walked,
p17
aVpie charts for the quality of your sleep \u2014
p18
aVthe path of your morning runs.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn my day job, I work with data.
p21
aVI run a data visualization design company,
p22
aVand we design and develop ways to make information accessible
p23
aVthrough visual representations.
p24
aVWhat my job has taught me over the years
p25
aVis that to really understand data and their true potential,
p26
aVsometimes we actually have to forget about them
p27
aVand see through them instead.
p28
aVBecause data are always just a tool we use to represent reality.
p29
aVThey're always used as a placeholder for something else,
p30
aVbut they are never the real thing.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut let me step back for a moment
p33
aVto when I first understood this personally.
p34
aVIn 1994, I was 13 years old.
p35
aVI was a teenager in Italy.
p36
aVI was too young to be interested in politics,
p37
aVbut I knew that a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi,
p38
aVwas running for president for the moderate right.
p39
aVWe lived in a very liberal town,
p40
aVand my father was a politician for the Democratic Party.
p41
aVAnd I remember that no one thought that Berlusconi could get elected \u2014
p42
aVthat was totally not an option.
p43
aVBut it happened.
p44
aVAnd I remember the feeling very vividly.
p45
aVIt was a complete surprise,
p46
aVas my dad promised that in my town he knew nobody who voted for him.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis was the first time
p49
aVwhen the data I had gave me a completely distorted image of reality.
p50
aVMy data sample was actually pretty limited and skewed,
p51
aVso probably it was because of that, I thought, I lived in a bubble,
p52
aVand I didn't have enough chances to see outside of it.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, fast-forward to November 8, 2016
p55
aVin the United States.
p56
aVThe internet polls,
p57
aVstatistical models,
p58
aVall the pundits agreeing on a possible outcome for the presidential election.
p59
aVIt looked like we had enough information this time,
p60
aVand many more chances to see outside the closed circle we lived in \u2014
p61
aVbut we clearly didn't.
p62
aVThe feeling felt very familiar.
p63
aVI had been there before.
p64
aVI think it's fair to say the data failed us this time \u2014
p65
aVand pretty spectacularly.
p66
aVWe believed in data,
p67
aVbut what happened,
p68
aVeven with the most respected newspaper,
p69
aVis that the obsession to reduce everything to two simple percentage numbers
p70
aVto make a powerful headline
p71
aVmade us focus on these two digits
p72
aVand them alone.
p73
aVIn an effort to simplify the message
p74
aVand draw a beautiful, inevitable red and blue map,
p75
aVwe lost the point completely.
p76
aVWe somehow forgot that there were stories \u2014
p77
aVstories of human beings behind these numbers.
p78
aa(lp79
VIn a different context,
p80
aVbut to a very similar point,
p81
aVa peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman.
p82
aVShe came to us with a lot of data,
p83
aVbut ultimately she wanted to tell one of the most humane stories possible.
p84
aVShe's Samantha Cristoforetti.
p85
aVShe has been the first Italian woman astronaut,
p86
aVand she contacted us before being launched
p87
aVon a six-month-long expedition to the International Space Station.
p88
aVShe told us, "I'm going to space,
p89
aVand I want to do something meaningful with the data of my mission
p90
aVto reach out to people."
p91
aVA mission to the International Space Station
p92
aVcomes with terabytes of data
p93
aVabout anything you can possibly imagine \u2014
p94
aVthe orbits around Earth,
p95
aVthe speed and position of the ISS
p96
aVand all of the other thousands of live streams from its sensors.
p97
aVWe had all of the hard data we could think of \u2014
p98
aVjust like the pundits before the election \u2014
p99
aVbut what is the point of all these numbers?
p100
aVPeople are not interested in data for the sake of it,
p101
aVbecause numbers are never the point.
p102
aVThey're always the means to an end.
p103
aVThe story we needed to tell
p104
aVis that there is a human being in a teeny box
p105
aVflying in space above your head,
p106
aVand that you can actually see her with your naked eye on a clear night.
p107
aVSo we decided to use data to create a connection
p108
aVbetween Samantha and all of the people looking at her from below.
p109
aVWe designed and developed what we called "Friends in Space,"
p110
aVa web application that simply lets you say "hello" to Samantha
p111
aVfrom where you are,
p112
aVand "hello" to all the people who are online at the same time
p113
aVfrom all over the world.
p114
aVAnd all of these "hellos" left visible marks on the map
p115
aVas Samantha was flying by
p116
aVand as she was actually waving back every day at us
p117
aVusing Twitter from the ISS.
p118
aa(lp119
VThis made people see the mission's data from a very different perspective.
p120
aVIt all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity,
p121
aVrather than technology.
p122
aVSo data powered the experience,
p123
aVbut stories of human beings were the drive.
p124
aVThe very positive response of its thousands of users
p125
aVtaught me a very important lesson \u2014
p126
aVthat working with data means designing ways
p127
aVto transform the abstract and the uncountable
p128
aVinto something that can be seen, felt and directly reconnected
p129
aVto our lives and to our behaviors,
p130
aVsomething that is hard to achieve
p131
aVif we let the obsession for the numbers and the technology around them
p132
aVlead us in the process.
p133
aVBut we can do even more to connect data to the stories they represent.
p134
aVWe can remove technology completely.
p135
aa(lp136
VA few years ago, I met this other woman,
p137
aVStefanie Posavec \u2014
p138
aVa London-based designer who shares with me the passion and obsession about data.
p139
aVWe didn't know each other,
p140
aVbut we decided to run a very radical experiment,
p141
aVstarting a communication using only data,
p142
aVno other language,
p143
aVand we opted for using no technology whatsoever to share our data.
p144
aVIn fact, our only means of communication
p145
aVwould be through the old-fashioned post office.
p146
aVFor "Dear Data," every week for one year,
p147
aVwe used our personal data to get to know each other \u2014
p148
aVpersonal data around weekly shared mundane topics,
p149
aVfrom our feelings
p150
aVto the interactions with our partners,
p151
aVfrom the compliments we received to the sounds of our surroundings.
p152
aVPersonal information that we would then manually hand draw
p153
aVon a postcard-size sheet of paper
p154
aVthat we would every week send from London to New York,
p155
aVwhere I live,
p156
aVand from New York to London, where she lives.
p157
aVThe front of the postcard is the data drawing,
p158
aVand the back of the card
p159
aVcontains the address of the other person, of course,
p160
aVand the legend for how to interpret our drawing.
p161
aVThe very first week into the project,
p162
aVwe actually chose a pretty cold and impersonal topic.
p163
aVHow many times do we check the time in a week?
p164
aVSo here is the front of my card,
p165
aVand you can see that every little symbol
p166
aVrepresents all of the times that I checked the time,
p167
aVpositioned for days and different hours chronologically \u2014
p168
aVnothing really complicated here.
p169
aVBut then you see in the legend
p170
aVhow I added anecdotal details about these moments.
p171
aVIn fact, the different types of symbols indicate why I was checking the time \u2014
p172
aVwhat was I doing?
p173
aVWas I bored? Was I hungry?
p174
aVWas I late?
p175
aVDid I check it on purpose or just casually glance at the clock?
p176
aVAnd this is the key part \u2014
p177
aVrepresenting the details of my days and my personality
p178
aVthrough my data collection.
p179
aVUsing data as a lens or a filter to discover and reveal, for example,
p180
aVmy never-ending anxiety for being late,
p181
aVeven though I'm absolutely always on time.
p182
aa(lp183
VStefanie and I spent one year collecting our data manually
p184
aVto force us to focus on the nuances that computers cannot gather \u2014
p185
aVor at least not yet \u2014
p186
aVusing data also to explore our minds and the words we use,
p187
aVand not only our activities.
p188
aVLike at week number three,
p189
aVwhere we tracked the "thank yous" we said and were received,
p190
aVand when I realized that I thank mostly people that I don't know.
p191
aVApparently I'm a compulsive thanker to waitresses and waiters,
p192
aVbut I definitely don't thank enough the people who are close to me.
p193
aa(lp194
VOver one year,
p195
aVthe process of actively noticing and counting these types of actions
p196
aVbecame a ritual.
p197
aVIt actually changed ourselves.
p198
aVWe became much more in tune with ourselves,
p199
aVmuch more aware of our behaviors and our surroundings.
p200
aVOver one year, Stefanie and I connected at a very deep level
p201
aVthrough our shared data diary,
p202
aVbut we could do this only because we put ourselves in these numbers,
p203
aVadding the contexts of our very personal stories to them.
p204
aVIt was the only way to make them truly meaningful
p205
aVand representative of ourselves.
p206
aa(lp207
VI am not asking you to start drawing your personal data,
p208
aVor to find a pen pal across the ocean.
p209
aVBut I'm asking you to consider data \u2014
p210
aVall kind of data \u2014
p211
aVas the beginning of the conversation
p212
aVand not the end.
p213
aVBecause data alone will never give us a solution.
p214
aVAnd this is why data failed us so badly \u2014
p215
aVbecause we failed to include the right amount of context
p216
aVto represent reality \u2014
p217
aVa nuanced, complicated and intricate reality.
p218
aVWe kept looking at these two numbers,
p219
aVobsessing with them
p220
aVand pretending that our world could be reduced
p221
aVto a couple digits and a horse race,
p222
aVwhile the real stories,
p223
aVthe ones that really mattered,
p224
aVwere somewhere else.
p225
aa(lp226
VWhat we missed looking at these stories only through models and algorithms
p227
aVis what I call "data humanism."
p228
aVIn the Renaissance humanism,
p229
aVEuropean intellectuals
p230
aVplaced the human nature instead of God at the center of their view of the world.
p231
aVI believe something similar needs to happen
p232
aVwith the universe of data.
p233
aVNow data are apparently treated like a God \u2014
p234
aVkeeper of infallible truth for our present and our future.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe experiences that I shared with you today
p237
aVtaught me that to make data faithfully representative of our human nature
p238
aVand to make sure they will not mislead us anymore,
p239
aVwe need to start designing ways to include empathy, imperfection
p240
aVand human qualities
p241
aVin how we collect, process, analyze and display them.
p242
aVI do see a place where, ultimately,
p243
aVinstead of using data only to become more efficient,
p244
aVwe will all use data to become more humane.
p245
