VWhat keeps us healthy and happy
p4
aVas we go through life?
p5
aVIf you were going to invest now
p6
aVin your future best self,
p7
aVwhere would you put your time and your energy?
p8
aVThere was a recent survey of millennials
p9
aVasking them what their most important life goals were,
p10
aVand over 80 percent said
p11
aVthat a major life goal for them was to get rich.
p12
aVAnd another 50 percent of those same young adults
p13
aVsaid that another major life goal
p14
aVwas to become famous.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
p19
aVand achieve more.
p20
aVWe're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
p21
aVin order to have a good life.
p22
aVPictures of entire lives,
p23
aVof the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
p24
aVthose pictures are almost impossible to get.
p25
aVMost of what we know about human life
p26
aVwe know from asking people to remember the past,
p27
aVand as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
p28
aVWe forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
p29
aVand sometimes memory is downright creative.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut what if we could watch entire lives
p32
aVas they unfold through time?
p33
aVWhat if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
p34
aVall the way into old age
p35
aVto see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
p36
aa(lp37
VWe did that.
p38
aVThe Harvard Study of Adult Development
p39
aVmay be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
p40
aVFor 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
p41
aVyear after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
p42
aVand of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
p43
aVwere going to turn out.
p44
aa(lp45
VStudies like this are exceedingly rare.
p46
aVAlmost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
p47
aVbecause too many people drop out of the study,
p48
aVor funding for the research dries up,
p49
aVor the researchers get distracted,
p50
aVor they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
p51
aVBut through a combination of luck
p52
aVand the persistence of several generations of researchers,
p53
aVthis study has survived.
p54
aVAbout 60 of our original 724 men
p55
aVare still alive,
p56
aVstill participating in the study,
p57
aVmost of them in their 90s.
p58
aVAnd we are now beginning to study
p59
aVthe more than 2,000 children of these men.
p60
aVAnd I'm the fourth director of the study.
p61
aa(lp62
VSince 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
p63
aVThe first group started in the study
p64
aVwhen they were sophomores at Harvard College.
p65
aVThey all finished college during World War II,
p66
aVand then most went off to serve in the war.
p67
aVAnd the second group that we've followed
p68
aVwas a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
p69
aVboys who were chosen for the study
p70
aVspecifically because they were from some of the most troubled
p71
aVand disadvantaged families
p72
aVin the Boston of the 1930s.
p73
aVMost lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen they entered the study,
p76
aVall of these teenagers were interviewed.
p77
aVThey were given medical exams.
p78
aVWe went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
p79
aVAnd then these teenagers grew up into adults
p80
aVwho entered all walks of life.
p81
aVThey became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
p82
aVone President of the United States.
p83
aVSome developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
p84
aVSome climbed the social ladder
p85
aVfrom the bottom all the way to the very top,
p86
aVand some made that journey in the opposite direction.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe founders of this study
p89
aVwould never in their wildest dreams
p90
aVhave imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
p91
aVtelling you that the study still continues.
p92
aVEvery two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
p93
aVcalls up our men and asks them if we can send them
p94
aVyet one more set of questions about their lives.
p95
aa(lp96
VMany of the inner city Boston men ask us,
p97
aV"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."
p98
aVThe Harvard men never ask that question.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VTo get the clearest picture of these lives,
p103
aVwe don't just send them questionnaires.
p104
aVWe interview them in their living rooms.
p105
aVWe get their medical records from their doctors.
p106
aVWe draw their blood, we scan their brains,
p107
aVwe talk to their children.
p108
aVWe videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
p109
aVAnd when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
p110
aVif they would join us as members of the study,
p111
aVmany of the women said, "You know, it's about time."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo what have we learned?
p116
aVWhat are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
p117
aVof information that we've generated
p118
aVon these lives?
p119
aVWell, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
p120
aVThe clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
p121
aVGood relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
p122
aa(lp123
VWe've learned three big lessons about relationships.
p124
aVThe first is that social connections are really good for us,
p125
aVand that loneliness kills.
p126
aVIt turns out that people who are more socially connected
p127
aVto family, to friends, to community,
p128
aVare happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
p129
aVthan people who are less well connected.
p130
aVAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
p131
aVPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others
p132
aVfind that they are less happy,
p133
aVtheir health declines earlier in midlife,
p134
aVtheir brain functioning declines sooner
p135
aVand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
p136
aVAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,
p137
aVmore than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
p140
aVand you can be lonely in a marriage,
p141
aVso the second big lesson that we learned
p142
aVis that it's not just the number of friends you have,
p143
aVand it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
p144
aVbut it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
p145
aVIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
p146
aVHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
p147
aVturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
p148
aVAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
p149
aa(lp150
VOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
p151
aVwe wanted to look back at them at midlife
p152
aVand to see if we could predict
p153
aVwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
p154
aVand who wasn't.
p155
aVAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them
p156
aVat age 50,
p157
aVit wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
p158
aVthat predicted how they were going to grow old.
p159
aVIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
p160
aVThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
p161
aVwere the healthiest at age 80.
p162
aVAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us
p163
aVfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
p164
aVOur most happily partnered men and women
p165
aVreported, in their 80s,
p166
aVthat on the days when they had more physical pain,
p167
aVtheir mood stayed just as happy.
p168
aVBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,
p169
aVon the days when they reported more physical pain,
p170
aVit was magnified by more emotional pain.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
p173
aVis that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
p174
aVthey protect our brains.
p175
aVIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
p176
aVto another person in your 80s is protective,
p177
aVthat the people who are in relationships
p178
aVwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
p179
aVthose people's memories stay sharper longer.
p180
aVAnd the people in relationships
p181
aVwhere they feel they really can't count on the other one,
p182
aVthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
p183
aVAnd those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
p184
aVSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
p185
aVday in and day out,
p186
aVbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
p187
aVwhen the going got tough,
p188
aVthose arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo this message,
p191
aVthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
p192
aVthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
p193
aVWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
p194
aVWell, we're human.
p195
aVWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,
p196
aVsomething we can get
p197
aVthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
p198
aVRelationships are messy and they're complicated
p199
aVand the hard work of tending to family and friends,
p200
aVit's not sexy or glamorous.
p201
aVIt's also lifelong. It never ends.
p202
aVThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
p203
aVwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
p204
aVJust like the millennials in that recent survey,
p205
aVmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults
p206
aVreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
p207
aVwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.
p208
aVBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
p209
aVthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
p210
aVwith family, with friends, with community.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo what about you?
p213
aVLet's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
p214
aVWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, the possibilities are practically endless.
p217
aVIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
p218
aVor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
p219
aVlong walks or date nights,
p220
aVor reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
p221
aVbecause those all-too-common family feuds
p222
aVtake a terrible toll
p223
aVon the people who hold the grudges.
p224
aa(lp225
VI'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
p226
aVMore than a century ago,
p227
aVhe was looking back on his life,
p228
aVand he wrote this:
p229
aV"There isn't time, so brief is life,
p230
aVfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
p231
aVThere is only time for loving,
p232
aVand but an instant, so to speak, for that."
p233
aa(lp234
VThe good life is built with good relationships.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
