VLet me talk about India
p4
aVthrough the evolution of ideas.
p5
aVNow I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it
p6
aVbecause in every society, especially an open democratic society,
p7
aVit's only when ideas take root that things change.
p8
aVSlowly ideas lead to ideology,
p9
aVlead to policies that lead to actions.
p10
aa(lp11
VIn 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,
p12
aVwhich led to all the ideas of the state and social security,
p13
aVand all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.
p14
aVIn the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.
p15
aVAnd today, after the global economic crisis,
p16
aVthere was a whole new set of rules
p17
aVabout how the state should intervene.
p18
aVSo ideas change states.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I looked at India and said,
p21
aVreally there are four kinds of ideas
p22
aVwhich really make an impact on India.
p23
aVThe first, to my mind,
p24
aVis what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
p25
aVThese ideas have brought together something
p26
aVwhich has made India happen the way it is today.
p27
aVThe second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."
p28
aVThose are ideas which have been accepted
p29
aVbut not implemented yet.
p30
aVThe third set of ideas are what I call as
p31
aV"ideas that we argue about" \u2014
p32
aVthose are ideas where we have a fight,
p33
aVan ideological battle about how to do things.
p34
aVAnd the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is
p35
aV"the ideas that we need to anticipate."
p36
aVBecause when you are a developing country
p37
aVin the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,
p38
aVyou can actually anticipate
p39
aVwhat that did and do things very differently.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow in India's case I believe there are six ideas
p42
aVwhich are responsible for where it has come today.
p43
aVThe first is really the notion of people.
p44
aVIn the '60s and '70s
p45
aVwe thought of people as a burden.
p46
aVWe thought of people as a liability.
p47
aVToday we talk of people as an asset.
p48
aVWe talk of people as human capital.
p49
aVAnd I believe this change in the mindset,
p50
aVof looking at people as something of a burden
p51
aVto human capital,
p52
aVhas been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.
p53
aVAnd this change in thinking of human capital
p54
aVis linked to the fact
p55
aVthat India is going through a demographic dividend.
p56
aVAs healthcare improves,
p57
aVas infant mortality goes down,
p58
aVfertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.
p59
aVIndia is going to have
p60
aVa lot of young people with a demographic dividend
p61
aVfor the next 30 years.
p62
aVWhat is unique about this demographic dividend
p63
aVis that India will be the only country in the world
p64
aVto have this demographic dividend.
p65
aVIn other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.
p66
aVAnd this is very important. At the same time
p67
aVif you peel away the demographic dividend in India,
p68
aVthere are actually two demographic curves.
p69
aVOne is in the south and in the west of India,
p70
aVwhich is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,
p71
aVbecause in that part of the country, the fertility rate is
p72
aValmost equal to that of a West European country.
p73
aVThen there is the whole northern India,
p74
aVwhich is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.
p75
aVBut a demographic dividend is only as good
p76
aVas the investment in your human capital.
p77
aVOnly if the people have education,
p78
aVthey have good health, they have infrastructure,
p79
aVthey have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night \u2014
p80
aVonly in those cases can you really get the benefit
p81
aVof a demographic dividend.
p82
aVIn other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,
p83
aVthe same demographic dividend
p84
aVcan be a demographic disaster.
p85
aVTherefore India is at a critical point
p86
aVwhere either it can leverage its demographic dividend
p87
aVor it can lead to a demographic disaster.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe second thing in India has been the change in
p90
aVthe role of entrepreneurs.
p91
aVWhen India got independence entrepreneurs were seen
p92
aVas a bad lot, as people who would exploit.
p93
aVBut today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,
p94
aVentrepreneurs have become role models,
p95
aVand they are contributing hugely to the society.
p96
aVThis change has contributed
p97
aVto the vitality and the whole economy.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe third big thing I believe that has changed India
p100
aVis our attitude towards the English language.
p101
aVEnglish language was seen as a language of the imperialists.
p102
aVBut today, with globalization,
p103
aVwith outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.
p104
aVThis has made it something that everybody wants to learn.
p105
aVAnd the fact that we have English is now becoming
p106
aVa huge strategic asset.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe next thing is technology.
p109
aVForty years back, computers were seen
p110
aVas something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,
p111
aVsomething that reduced jobs.
p112
aVToday we live in a country
p113
aVwhich sells eight million mobile phones a month,
p114
aVof which 90 percent of those mobile phones
p115
aVare prepaid phones
p116
aVbecause people don't have credit history.
p117
aVForty percent of those prepaid phones
p118
aVare recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.
p119
aVThat is the scale at which
p120
aVtechnology has liberated and made it accessible.
p121
aVAnd therefore technology has gone
p122
aVfrom being seen as something forbidding
p123
aVand intimidating to something that is empowering.
p124
aVTwenty years back,
p125
aVwhen there was a report on bank computerization,
p126
aVthey didn't name the report as
p127
aVa report on computers,
p128
aVthey call them as "ledger posting machines."
p129
aVThey didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.
p130
aVAnd when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers
p131
aVthey called them "advanced ledger posting machines."
p132
aVSo we have come a long way from those days
p133
aVwhere the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,
p134
aVand really has changed the way Indians think of technology.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd then I think the other point
p137
aVis that Indians today are far more
p138
aVcomfortable with globalization.
p139
aVAgain, after having lived for more than 200 years
p140
aVunder the East India Company and under imperial rule,
p141
aVIndians had a very natural reaction towards globalization
p142
aVbelieving it was a form of imperialism.
p143
aVBut today, as Indian companies go abroad,
p144
aVas Indians come and work all over the world,
p145
aVIndians have gained a lot more confidence
p146
aVand have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.
p147
aVAnd the fact that the demographics are in our favor,
p148
aVbecause we are the only young country in an aging world,
p149
aVmakes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd finally, India has had
p152
aVthe deepening of its democracy.
p153
aVWhen democracy came to India 60 years back
p154
aVit was an elite concept.
p155
aVIt was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy
p156
aVbecause they wanted to bring in the idea of
p157
aVuniversal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.
p158
aVBut today democracy has become a bottom-up process
p159
aVwhere everybody has realized
p160
aVthe benefits of having a voice,
p161
aVthe benefits of being in an open society.
p162
aVAnd therefore democracy has become embedded.
p163
aa(lp164
VI believe these six factors \u2014
p165
aVthe rise of the notion of population as human capital,
p166
aVthe rise of Indian entrepreneurs,
p167
aVthe rise of English as a language of aspiration,
p168
aVtechnology as something empowering,
p169
aVglobalization as a positive factor,
p170
aVand the deepening of democracy \u2014 has contributed
p171
aVto why India is today growing
p172
aVat rates it has never seen before.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut having said that,
p175
aVthen we come to what I call as ideas in progress.
p176
aVThose are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,
p177
aVbut you are not able to implement those things.
p178
aVAnd really there are four things here.
p179
aVOne is the question of education.
p180
aVFor some reason, whatever reason \u2014 lack of money,
p181
aVlack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture \u2014
p182
aVprimary education was never given the focus it required.
p183
aVBut now I believe it's reached a point
p184
aVwhere it has become very important.
p185
aVUnfortunately the government schools don't function,
p186
aVso children are going to private schools today.
p187
aVEven in the slums of India
p188
aVmore than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.
p189
aVSo there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.
p190
aVBut having said that, there is an enormous desire
p191
aVamong everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.
p192
aVSo I believe primary education is an idea
p193
aVwhich is arrived but not yet implemented.
p194
aa(lp195
VSimilarly, infrastructure \u2014
p196
aVfor a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.
p197
aVThose of you who have been to India have seen that.
p198
aVIt's certainly not like China.
p199
aVBut today I believe finally infrastructure is something
p200
aVwhich is agreed upon and which people want to implement.
p201
aVIt is reflected in the political statements.
p202
aV20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"
p203
aVwhich meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."
p204
aVAnd today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"
p205
aVwhich means "Electricity, water and roads."
p206
aVAnd that is a change in the mindset
p207
aVwhere infrastructure is now accepted.
p208
aVSo I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,
p209
aVbut simply not implemented.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe third thing is again cities.
p212
aVIt's because Gandhi believed in villages
p213
aVand because the British ruled from the cities,
p214
aVtherefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.
p215
aVFor a long time we have neglected our cities.
p216
aVAnd that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.
p217
aVBut today, finally, after economic reforms,
p218
aVand economic growth,
p219
aVI think the notion that cities are engines
p220
aVof economic growth,
p221
aVcities are engines of creativity,
p222
aVcities are engines of innovation,
p223
aVhave finally been accepted.
p224
aVAnd I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.
p225
aVAgain, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe final thing is the notion of India as a single market \u2014
p228
aVbecause when you didn't think of India as a market,
p229
aVyou didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.
p230
aVAnd therefore you had a situation
p231
aVwhere every state had its own market for products.
p232
aVEvery province had its own market for agriculture.
p233
aVIncreasingly now the policies of
p234
aVtaxation and infrastructure and all that,
p235
aVare moving towards creating India as a single market.
p236
aVSo there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,
p237
aVwhich is as important as external globalization.
p238
aVThese four factors I believe \u2014
p239
aVthe ones of primary education,
p240
aVinfrastructure, urbanization, and single market \u2014
p241
aVin my view are ideas in India
p242
aVwhich have been accepted, but not implemented.
p243
aa(lp244
VThen we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.
p245
aVThe ideas that we argue about.
p246
aVThese are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
p247
aVWhat are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.
p248
aVBecause of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,
p249
aVand because of the fact that there have been many people
p250
aVwho have been left out in the cold,
p251
aVa lot of the politics is about how to make sure
p252
aVthat we'll address that.
p253
aVAnd it leads to reservations and other techniques.
p254
aVIt's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,
p255
aVand all the left and right arguments that we have.
p256
aVA lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology
p257
aVof caste and other things.
p258
aVThis policy is causing gridlock.
p259
aVThis is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe second one is the labor policies that we have,
p262
aVwhich make it so difficult for
p263
aVentrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,
p264
aVthat 93 percent of Indian labor
p265
aVis in the unorganized sector.
p266
aVThey have no benefits: they don't have social security;
p267
aVthey don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.
p268
aVThis needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people
p269
aVinto the formal workforce,
p270
aVyou will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
p271
aVTherefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,
p272
aVwhich are not as onerous as they are today.
p273
aVAt the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,
p274
aVand create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe third thing is our higher education.
p277
aVIndian higher education is completely regulated.
p278
aVIt's very difficult to start a private university.
p279
aVIt's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.
p280
aVAs a result of that our higher education
p281
aVis simply not keeping pace with India's demands.
p282
aVThat is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut most important I believe
p285
aVare the ideas we need to anticipate.
p286
aVHere India can look at what is happening in the west
p287
aVand elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.
p288
aVThe first thing is, we're very fortunate
p289
aVthat technology is at a point
p290
aVwhere it is much more advanced
p291
aVthan when other countries had the development.
p292
aVSo we can use technology for governance.
p293
aVWe can use technology for direct benefits.
p294
aVWe can use technology for transparency, and many other things.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe second thing is, the health issue.
p297
aVIndia has equally horrible
p298
aVhealth problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,
p299
aVthe higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.
p300
aVSo there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases
p301
aVwith a set of rich country diseases.
p302
aVTherefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.
p303
aVWe really need to put in place a strategy
p304
aVso that we don't go to the other extreme of health.
p305
aa(lp306
VSimilarly today in the West
p307
aVyou're seeing the problem of entitlement \u2014
p308
aVthe cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.
p309
aVTherefore when you are a young country,
p310
aVagain you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system
p311
aVso that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd then again, India does not have the luxury
p314
aVof making its environment dirty,
p315
aVbecause it has to marry environment and development.
p316
aVJust to give an idea, the world has to stabilize
p317
aVat something like 20 gigatons per year.
p318
aVOn a population of nine billion
p319
aVour average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.
p320
aVIndia is already at two tons per year.
p321
aVBut if India grows at something like eight percent,
p322
aVincome per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.
p323
aVSo we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.
p324
aVTherefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,
p325
aVthe way we look at energy,
p326
aVthe way we create whole new paradigms of development.
p327
aa(lp328
VNow why does this matter to you?
p329
aVWhy does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?
p330
aVNumber one, this matters because
p331
aVthis represents more than a billion people.
p332
aVA billion people, 1/6th of the world population.
p333
aVIt matters because this is a democracy.
p334
aVAnd it is important to prove
p335
aVthat growth and democracy are not incompatible,
p336
aVthat you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,
p337
aVand you can have growth.
p338
aVIt's important because if you solve these problems,
p339
aVyou can solve the problems of poverty in the world.
p340
aVIt's important because
p341
aVyou need it to solve the world's environment problems.
p342
aa(lp343
VIf we really want to come to a point,
p344
aVwe really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,
p345
aVwe want to really lower the use of energy \u2014
p346
aVit has to be solved in countries like India.
p347
aVYou know if you look at the development
p348
aVin the West over 200 years,
p349
aVthe average growth may have been about two percent.
p350
aVHere we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.
p351
aVAnd that makes a huge difference.
p352
aVWhen India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent
p353
aVand the population was growing at two percent,
p354
aVits per capita income was doubling every 45 years.
p355
aVWhen the economic growth goes to eight percent
p356
aVand population growth drops to 1.5 percent,
p357
aVthen per capita income is doubling every nine years.
p358
aVIn other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process
p359
aVof a billion people going to prosperity.
p360
aVAnd you must have a clear strategy
p361
aVwhich is important for India and important for the world.
p362
aVThat is why I think all of you
p363
aVshould be equally concerned with it as I am.
p364
aVThank you very much.
