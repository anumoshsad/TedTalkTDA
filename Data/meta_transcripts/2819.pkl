VIf you've been thinking about US politics
p4
aVand trying to make sense of it for the last year or so,
p5
aVyou might have hit on something like the following three propositions:
p6
aVone, US partisanship has never been so bad before;
p7
aVtwo,
p8
aVfor the first time, it's geographically spatialized \u2014
p9
aVwe're divided between the coasts, which want to look outwards,
p10
aVand the center of the country, which wants to look inwards;
p11
aVand third,
p12
aVthere's nothing we can do about it.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm here to today to say that all three of these propositions,
p15
aVall of which sound reasonable,
p16
aVare not true.
p17
aVIn fact,
p18
aVour US partisanship goes all the way back
p19
aVto the very beginning of the republic.
p20
aVIt was geographically spatialized in almost eerily the same way
p21
aVthat it is today,
p22
aVand it often has been throughout US history.
p23
aVAnd last,
p24
aVand by far most importantly,
p25
aVwe actually have an extraordinary mechanism
p26
aVthat's designed to help us manage factional disagreement and partisanship.
p27
aVThat technology is the Constitution.
p28
aVAnd this is an evolving, subtly, supplely designed entity
p29
aVthat has the specific purpose
p30
aVof teaching us how to manage factional disagreement
p31
aVwhere it's possible to do that,
p32
aVand giving us techniques for overcoming that disagreement
p33
aVwhen that's possible.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, in order to tell you the story,
p36
aVI want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history,
p37
aVand that is the moment
p38
aVwhen factional disagreement and partisanship was born.
p39
aVThere actually was a birth moment \u2014
p40
aVa moment in US history when partisanship snapped into place.
p41
aVThe person who's at the core of that story is James Madison.
p42
aVAnd at the moment that this began,
p43
aVJames Madison was riding high.
p44
aVHe himself was the Einstein of not only the US Constitution,
p45
aVbut of constitutional thought more globally,
p46
aVand, to give him his due,
p47
aVhe knew it.
p48
aVIn a period of time of just three years,
p49
aVfrom 1785 to 1788,
p50
aVhe had conceived, theorized, designed, passed and gotten ratified
p51
aVthe US Constitution.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd just to give you some sense of the enormity
p54
aVof what that accomplishment actually was,
p55
aValthough Madison couldn't have known it at the time,
p56
aVtoday that same constitutional technology that he invented is still in use
p57
aVnot only in the US,
p58
aVbut, 230 years later,
p59
aVin places like Canada,
p60
aVIndia,
p61
aVSouth Africa,
p62
aVBrazil.
p63
aVSo in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world,
p64
aVthis technology is still the dominant,
p65
aVmost used, most effective technology to manage governance.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn that moment,
p68
aVMadison believed that, having solved this problem,
p69
aVthe country would run smoothly,
p70
aVand that he had designed a technology
p71
aVthat would minimize the results of factions
p72
aVso there would be no political parties.
p73
aVRemarkably, he thought he had designed a constitution
p74
aVthat was against political parties
p75
aVand would make them unnecessary.
p76
aa(lp77
VHe had gotten an enormous degree of help
p78
aVin the final marketing phase of his constitutional project
p79
aVfrom a man you may have heard of, called Alexander Hamilton.
p80
aVNow, Hamilton was everything Madison was not.
p81
aVHe was passionate, where Madison was restrained.
p82
aVHe was pansexual,
p83
aVwhere Madison didn't speak to a woman expect for once
p84
aVuntil he was 42 years old,
p85
aVand then married Dolley and lived happily ever after for 40 years.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VTo put it bluntly,
p90
aVHamilton's the kind of person
p91
aVabout whom you would write a hip-hop musical \u2014
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
Vand Madison is the kind of person
p96
aVabout whom you would not write a hip-hop musical.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VOr indeed, a musical of any kind at all.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut together,
p103
aVthey had become a rather unlikely pairing,
p104
aVand they had produced the Federalist Papers,
p105
aVwhich offered a justification
p106
aVand, as I mentioned,
p107
aVa marketing plan for the Constitution,
p108
aVwhich had been wildly effective and wildly successful.
p109
aa(lp110
VOnce the new government was in place,
p111
aVHamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,
p112
aVand he had a very specific idea in mind.
p113
aVAnd that was
p114
aVto do for financial institutions and infrastructure
p115
aVexactly what Madison had done for constitutions.
p116
aVAgain, his contemporaries all knew it.
p117
aVOne of them told Madison,
p118
aVwho can't have liked it very much,
p119
aVthat Hamilton was the Newton of infrastructure.
p120
aVThe idea was pretty straightforward.
p121
aVHamilton would give the United States a national bank,
p122
aVa permanent national debt \u2014
p123
aVhe said it would be "immortal," his phrase \u2014
p124
aVand a manufacturing policy that would enable trade and manufacturing
p125
aVrather than agriculture,
p126
aVwhich was where the country's primary wealth had historically been.
p127
aa(lp128
VMadison went utterly ballistic.
p129
aVAnd in this pivotal, critical decision,
p130
aVinstead of just telling the world that his old friend Hamilton was wrong
p131
aVand was adopting the wrong policies,
p132
aVhe actually began to argue
p133
aVthat Hamilton's ideas were unconstitutional \u2014
p134
aVthat they violated the very nature of the Constitution
p135
aVthat the two of them had drafted together.
p136
aVHamilton responded the way you would expect.
p137
aVHe declared Madison to be his "personal and political enemy" \u2014
p138
aVthese are his words.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo these two founders who had been such close friends and such close allies
p141
aVand such partners,
p142
aVthen began to produce enmity.
p143
aVAnd they did it in the good, old-fashioned way.
p144
aVFirst, they founded political parties.
p145
aVMadison created a party originally called the Democratic Republican Party \u2014
p146
aV"Republican" for short \u2014
p147
aVand Hamilton created a party called the Federalist Party.
p148
aVThose two parties adopted positions on national politics
p149
aVthat were extreme and exaggerated.
p150
aVTo give you a clear example:
p151
aVMadison, who had always believed
p152
aVthat the country would have some manufacturing and some trade
p153
aVand some agriculture,
p154
aVbegan attacking Hamilton
p155
aVas a kind of tool of the financial markets
p156
aVwhom Hamilton himself intended to put in charge of the country.
p157
aVThat was an overstatement,
p158
aVbut it was something Madison came to believe.
p159
aa(lp160
VHe also attacked city life,
p161
aVand he said that the coasts were corrupt,
p162
aVand what people needed to do was to look inwards
p163
aVto the center of the country,
p164
aVto farmers, who were the essence of Republican virtue,
p165
aVand they should go back to the values that had made American great,
p166
aVspecifically the values of the Revolution,
p167
aVand those were the values of low taxes,
p168
aVagriculture
p169
aVand less trade.
p170
aVHamilton responded to this by saying that Madison was naïve,
p171
aVthat he was childish,
p172
aVand that his goal was to turn the United States
p173
aVinto a primitive autarchy,
p174
aVself-reliant and completely ineffectual on the global scale.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VThey both meant it,
p179
aVand there was some truth to each of their claims,
p180
aVbecause each side was grossly exaggerating the views of the other
p181
aVin order to fight their war.
p182
aVThey founded newspapers,
p183
aVand so for the first time in US history,
p184
aVthe news that people received came entirely through the lens
p185
aVof either the Republican or the Federalist party.
p186
aa(lp187
VHow does this end?
p188
aVWell, as it turned out, the Constitution did its work.
p189
aVBut it did its work in surprising ways
p190
aVthat Madison himself had not fully anticipated.
p191
aVFirst, there was a series of elections.
p192
aVAnd the first two times out of the box,
p193
aVthe Federalists destroyed the Republicans.
p194
aVMadison was astonished.
p195
aVOf course, he blamed the press.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd in a rather innovative view \u2014
p200
aVMadison never failed to innovate when he thought about anything \u2014
p201
aVhe said the reason that the press was so pro-Federalist
p202
aVis that the advertisers were all Federalists,
p203
aVbecause they were traders on the coasts who got their capital from Britain,
p204
aVwhich Federalism was in bed with.
p205
aVThat was his initial explanation.
p206
aVBut despite the fact that the Federalists,
p207
aVonce in power,
p208
aVactually enacted laws that criminalized criticism of the government \u2014
p209
aVthat happened in the United States \u2014
p210
aVnevertheless,
p211
aVthe Republicans fought back,
p212
aVand Madison began to emphasize the freedom of speech,
p213
aVwhich he had built into the Bill of Rights,
p214
aVand the capacity of civil society
p215
aVto organize.
p216
aVAnd sure enough, nationally,
p217
aVsmall local groups \u2014 they were called Democratic-Republican Societies \u2014
p218
aVbegan to form and protest against Federalist-dominated hegemony.
p219
aVEventually, the Republicans managed to win a national election \u2014
p220
aVthat was in 1800.
p221
aVMadison became the Secretary of State,
p222
aVhis friend and mentor Jefferson became president,
p223
aVand they actually, over time,
p224
aVmanaged to put the Federalists completely out of business.
p225
aVThat was their goal.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, why did that happen?
p228
aVIt happened because in the structure of the Constitution
p229
aVwere several features that actually managed faction
p230
aVthe way there were supposed to do in the first place.
p231
aVWhat were those?
p232
aVOne \u2014 most important of all \u2014
p233
aVthe freedom of speech.
p234
aVThis was an innovative idea at the time.
p235
aVNamely, that if you were out of power,
p236
aVyou could still say that the government was terrible.
p237
aa(lp238
VTwo,
p239
aVcivil society organization.
p240
aVThe capacity to put together private groups, individuals,
p241
aVpolitical parties and others
p242
aVwho would organize to try to bring about fundamental change.
p243
aVPerhaps most significantly was the separation of powers \u2014
p244
aVan extraordinary component of the Constitution.
p245
aVThe thing about the separation of powers
p246
aVis that it did then and it does now,
p247
aVdrive governance to the center.
p248
aVYou can get elected to office in the United States
p249
aVwith help from the periphery,
p250
aVright or left.
p251
aVIt turns out,
p252
aVyou actually can't govern unless you bring on board the center.
p253
aVThere are midterm elections that come incredibly fast
p254
aVafter a presidency begins.
p255
aVThose drive presidents towards the center.
p256
aa(lp257
VThere's a structure in which the president, in fact, does not rule
p258
aVor even govern,
p259
aVbut can only propose laws which other people have to agree with \u2014
p260
aVanother feature that tends to drive presidents
p261
aVwho actually want to get things done
p262
aVto the center.
p263
aVAnd a glance at the newspapers today will reveal to you
p264
aVthat these principles are still completely in operation.
p265
aVNo matter how a president gets elected,
p266
aVthe president cannot get anything done
p267
aVunless the president first of all follows the rules of the Constitution,
p268
aVbecause if not,
p269
aVthe courts will stand up, as indeed has sometimes occurred,
p270
aVnot only recently, but in the past, in US history.
p271
aVAnd furthermore,
p272
aVthe president needs people,
p273
aVelected officials who know they need to win election
p274
aVfrom centrist voters,
p275
aValso to back his or her policies in order to pass laws.
p276
aVWithout it, nothing much happens.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe takeaway of this brief excursus
p279
aVinto the history of partisanship, then, is the following:
p280
aVpartisanship is real;
p281
aVit's profound;
p282
aVit's extraordinarily powerful,
p283
aVand it's terribly upsetting.
p284
aVBut the design of the Constitution is greater than partisanship.
p285
aVIt enables us to manage partisanship when that's possible,
p286
aVand it enables us actually to overcome partisan division
p287
aVand produce compromise,
p288
aVwhen and only when that is possible.
p289
aVA technology like that is a technology that worked
p290
aVfor the founders,
p291
aVit worked for their grandchildren,
p292
aVit didn't work at the moment of the Civil War,
p293
aVbut then it started working again.
p294
aVAnd it worked for our grandparents,
p295
aVour parents,
p296
aVand it's going to work for us.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VSo what you should do is really simple.
p301
aVStand up for what you believe in,
p302
aVsupport the organizations that you care about,
p303
aVspeak out on the issues that matter to you,
p304
aVget involved,
p305
aVmake change,
p306
aVexpress you opinion,
p307
aVand do it with respect and knowledge and confidence
p308
aVthat it's only by working together
p309
aVthat the constitutional technology can do the job that it is designed to do.
p310
aa(lp311
VStand up for what you believe,
p312
aVbut take a deep breath while you do it.
p313
aVIt's going to be OK.
p314
aa(lp315
VThanks.
