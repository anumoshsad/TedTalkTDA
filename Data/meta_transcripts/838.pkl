VOne of the things that
p4
aVdefines a TEDster
p5
aVis you've taken your passion,
p6
aVand you've turned it into stewardship.
p7
aVYou actually put action to the issues you care about.
p8
aVBut what you're going to find eventually is
p9
aVyou may need to actually get elected officials
p10
aVto help you out.
p11
aVSo, how do you do that?
p12
aa(lp13
VOne of the things I should probably tell you is,
p14
aVI worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,
p15
aVand that sort of warped my framework.
p16
aVSo, when you start to think about politicians,
p17
aVyou've got to realize these are strange creatures.
p18
aVOther than the fact that they can't tell directions,
p19
aVand they have very strange breeding habits,
p20
aVhow do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)
p21
aVWhat we need to understand is:
p22
aVWhat drives the political creature?
p23
aVAnd there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
p24
aVOne is reputation and influence.
p25
aVThese are the primary tools by which
p26
aVa politician can do his job.
p27
aVThe second one \u2014 unlike most animals,
p28
aVwhich is survival of the species \u2014
p29
aVthis is preservation of self.
p30
aVNow you may think it's money,
p31
aVbut that's actually sort of a proxy
p32
aVto what I can do to preserve myself.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, the challenge with you moving your issue forward
p35
aVis these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
p36
aVSo, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
p37
aVYou can send them an email.
p38
aVWell, unfortunately, I've got so many
p39
aVViagra ads coming at me,
p40
aVyour email is lost.
p41
aVIt doesn't matter, it's spam.
p42
aVHow about you get on the phone?
p43
aVWell, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,
p44
aV"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
p45
aVThat doesn't move.
p46
aVFace to face would work,
p47
aVbut it's hard to set it up.
p48
aVIt's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
p49
aVYes, contributions actually do make a difference
p50
aVand they set a context for having a conversation,
p51
aVbut it takes some time to build up.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo what actually works?
p54
aVAnd the answer is rather strange.
p55
aVIt's a letter.
p56
aVWe live in a digital world,
p57
aVbut we're fairly analog creatures.
p58
aVLetters actually work.
p59
aVEven the top dog himself
p60
aVtakes time every day to read 10 letters
p61
aVthat are picked out by staff.
p62
aVI can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with
p63
aVwill tell you about the letters they get
p64
aVand what they mean.
p65
aVSo, how are you going to write your letter?
p66
aVFirst of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
p67
aVI know these are tough, and you may have a hard time
p68
aVgetting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)
p69
aVbut this is actually critical.
p70
aVAnd it is critical that
p71
aVyou actually handwrite your letter.
p72
aVIt is so novel to see this,
p73
aVthat somebody actually picked up an analog device
p74
aVand has written to me.
p75
aVSecond of all, I'm going to recommend that
p76
aVyou get into a proactive stance
p77
aVand write to your elected officials at least once a month.
p78
aVHere's my promise to you:
p79
aVIf you are consistent and do this,
p80
aVwithin three months the elected official will start calling you
p81
aVwhen that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, I'm going to give you
p84
aVa four paragraph format to work with.
p85
aVNow, when you approach these animals,
p86
aVyou need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,
p87
aVand you also need to approach them
p88
aVwith some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
p89
aVSo in paragraph number one,
p90
aVwhat I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:
p91
aVYou appreciate them.
p92
aVYou may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,
p93
aVbut maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
p94
aVWhen animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
p95
aVThey don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
p96
aVSo, here you go. (Laughter)
p97
aVParagraph number two:
p98
aVYou may actually have to just get very blunt
p99
aVand say what's really on your mind.
p100
aVWhen you do this,
p101
aVdon't attack people;
p102
aVyou attack tactics.
p103
aVAd hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
p104
aVParagraph number three:
p105
aVWhen animals are attacked or cornered,
p106
aVthey will fight to the death,
p107
aVso you have to give them an exit.
p108
aVMost of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
p109
aV"Obviously, you're intelligent.
p110
aVIf you had the right information,
p111
aVyou would have done the right thing." (Laughter)
p112
aVLastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
p113
aVYou're the safe place to come in to.
p114
aVSo, in paragraph number four,
p115
aVyou're going to tell people,
p116
aV"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VAnimals do displays. They do two things:
p119
aVThey warn you or they try to attract you
p120
aVand say, "We need to mate."
p121
aVYou're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
p122
aVYou do a number of things: you're a vice president,
p123
aVyou volunteer, you do something else.
p124
aVWhy is is this important?
p125
aVBecause this establishes the two
p126
aVprimary criteria for the political creature:
p127
aVthat you have influence in a large sphere,
p128
aVand that my preservation depends on you.
p129
aa(lp130
VHere is one very quick hack,
p131
aVespecially for the feds in the audience.
p132
aVHere's how you mail your letter.
p133
aVFirst of all, you send the original to the district office.
p134
aVSo, you send the copy to the main office.
p135
aVIf they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
p136
aVThen some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler
p137
aVand says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
p138
aVAnd you actually get into the folder
p139
aVthat the elected official actually has to read.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, what your letter means:
p142
aVI've got to tell you, we are all in a party,
p143
aVand political officials are the pinatas.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVWe are harangued, lectured to,
p146
aVsold, marketed,
p147
aVbut a letter is actually one of the few times
p148
aVthat we have honest communication.
p149
aVI got this letter when I was first elected,
p150
aVand I still carry it to
p151
aVevery council meeting I go to.
p152
aVThis is an opportunity at real dialogue,
p153
aVand if you have stewardship
p154
aVand want to communicate,
p155
aVthat dialogue is incredibly powerful.
p156
aVSo when you do that, here's what I can promise:
p157
aVYou're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
p158
aa(lp159
VGet writing.
