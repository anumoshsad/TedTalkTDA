VI'm going to share with you the story
p4
aVas to how I have become
p5
aVan HIV/AIDS campaigner.
p6
aVAnd this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
p7
aVIn November of 2003,
p8
aVI was invited to take part
p9
aVin the launch of Nelson Mandela's
p10
aV46664 Foundation \u2014
p11
aVthat is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
p12
aVAnd 46664 is the number
p13
aVthat Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
p14
aVAnd that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
p15
aVonstage, having the time of my life.
p16
aVThe next day, all the artists were invited
p17
aVto join Mandela in Robben Island,
p18
aVwhere he was going to give a conference
p19
aVto the world's press,
p20
aVstanding in front of his former prison cell.
p21
aVYou can see the bars of the window there.
p22
aVIt was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
p23
aVIn that moment in time,
p24
aVMandela told the world's press
p25
aVthat there was a virtual genocide
p26
aVtaking place in his country;
p27
aVthat post-apartheid
p28
aVRainbow Nation,
p29
aVa thousand people were dying on a daily basis
p30
aVand that the front line victims,
p31
aVthe most vulnerable of all,
p32
aVwere women and children.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis was a huge impact on my mind,
p35
aVbecause I am a woman and I am a mother,
p36
aVand I hadn't realized
p37
aVthat the HIV/AIDS pandemic
p38
aVwas directly affecting women in such a way.
p39
aVAnd so I committed \u2014 when I left South Africa,
p40
aVwhen I left Capetown,
p41
aVI told myself, "This is going to be something
p42
aVthat I have to talk about.
p43
aVI have to serve."
p44
aVAnd so, subsequently
p45
aVI participated in every single
p46
aV46664 event
p47
aVthat I could take part in
p48
aVand gave news conferences,
p49
aVinterviews,
p50
aVtalking and using my platform as a musician,
p51
aVwith my commitment to Mandela \u2014
p52
aVout of respect for the tremendous,
p53
aVunbelievable work that he had done.
p54
aVEveryone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
p55
aVeveryone reveres Nelson Mandela.
p56
aVBut do they all know
p57
aVabout what has been taking place in South Africa,
p58
aVhis country,
p59
aVthe country that had one of the highest incidents
p60
aVof transmission of the virus?
p61
aVI think that if I went out into the street now
p62
aVand I told people what was happening there,
p63
aVthey would be shocked.
p64
aa(lp65
VI was very, very fortunate a couple of years later
p66
aVto have met Zackie Achmat,
p67
aVthe founder of Treatment Action Campaign,
p68
aVan incredible campaigner and activist.
p69
aVI met him at a 46664 event.
p70
aVHe was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
p71
aVThis is a tool \u2014
p72
aVthis tells you I am in solidarity
p73
aVwith people who have HIV,
p74
aVpeople who are living with HIV.
p75
aVAnd in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt
p76
aVI say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
p77
aVIt doesn't have to be in the closet."
p78
aVI became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
p79
aVand I'm very proud to be a member
p80
aVof that incredible organization.
p81
aVIt's a grassroots campaign
p82
aVwith 80 percent membership being women,
p83
aVmost of whom are HIV-positive.
p84
aVThey work in the field.
p85
aVThey have tremendous outreach
p86
aVto the people who are living directly
p87
aVwith the effects of the virus.
p88
aVThey have education programs.
p89
aVThey bring out the issues of stigma.
p90
aVIt's quite extraordinary what they do.
p91
aVAnd yes, my SING Campaign
p92
aVhas supported Treatment Action Campaign
p93
aVin the way that I have tried to raise awareness
p94
aVand to try to also raise funds.
p95
aVA lot of the funding that I have managed to raise
p96
aVhas gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign
p97
aVand the incredible work that they do,
p98
aVand are still continuing to do in South Africa.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo this is my SING Campaign.
p101
aVSING Campaign is basically just me
p102
aVand about three or four wonderful people
p103
aVwho help to support me.
p104
aVI've traveled all over the world
p105
aVin the last two and a half years \u2014
p106
aVI went to about 12 different countries.
p107
aVHere I am in Oslo in Norway,
p108
aVgetting a nice, fat check;
p109
aVsinging in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
p110
aVIn Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play
p111
aVto a mainly white, middle-class South African audience
p112
aVwho ended up in tears
p113
aVbecause I use film clips
p114
aVthat really touch the heart, the whole nature,
p115
aVof this terrible tragedy that is taking place,
p116
aVthat people are tending to avoid,
p117
aVbecause they are fatigued,
p118
aVand they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
p119
aVAaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,
p120
aVattended that concert
p121
aVand I had an opportunity to meet with him,
p122
aVand he gave his absolute commitment
p123
aVto try to making a change,
p124
aVwhich is absolutely necessary.
p125
aVThis is in the Scottish Parliament.
p126
aVI've subsequently become an envoy
p127
aVfor Scotland and HIV.
p128
aVAnd I was showing them my experiences
p129
aVand trying to, again, raise awareness.
p130
aVAnd once again, in Edinburgh
p131
aVwith the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
p132
aVAnd it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned
p133
aVbecause of their family being affected
p134
aVby the AIDS virus.
p135
aa(lp136
VI'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe \u2014
p137
aVhe's the director of UNAIDS.
p138
aVAnd I'm very honored
p139
aVby the fact that Michel invited me,
p140
aVonly a few months ago,
p141
aVto become a UNAIDS ambassador.
p142
aVAnd in this way, I've been strengthening my platform
p143
aVand broadening my outreach.
p144
aVThe message that UNAIDS
p145
aVare currently sending out to the world
p146
aVis that we would like to see the virtual elimination
p147
aVof the transmission of the virus
p148
aVfrom mother to child by 2015.
p149
aVIt's a very ambitious goal
p150
aVbut we believe it can be achieved with political will.
p151
aVThis can happen.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd here I am with a pregnant woman,
p154
aVwho is HIV positive
p155
aVand we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,
p156
aVbecause we know that that young woman
p157
aVis receiving treatment
p158
aVso her life can be extended
p159
aVto take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
p160
aVAnd her baby will receive PMTCT,
p161
aVwhich will mean that that baby
p162
aVcan be born free of the virus.
p163
aVNow that is prevention
p164
aVat the very beginning of life.
p165
aVIt's one way to start looking at intervention
p166
aVwith the AIDS pandemic.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, I just would like to finish off
p169
aVto tell you the little story
p170
aVabout Avelile.
p171
aVThis is Avelile \u2014
p172
aVshe goes with me wherever I go.
p173
aVI tell her story to everyone
p174
aVbecause she represents
p175
aVone of millions
p176
aVof HIV/AIDS orphans.
p177
aVAvelile's mother
p178
aVhad HIV virus \u2014
p179
aVshe died
p180
aVfrom AIDS-related illness.
p181
aVAvelile had the virus,
p182
aVshe was born with the virus.
p183
aVAnd here she is at seven years old,
p184
aVweighing no more than a one year-old baby.
p185
aVAt this point in her life,
p186
aVshe's suffering with full-blown AIDS
p187
aVand had pneumonia.
p188
aVWe met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
p189
aVand spent a whole afternoon with her \u2014 an adorable child.
p190
aVThe doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
p191
aVThey put her on very special nutritious diet
p192
aVand took great care of her.
p193
aVAnd we didn't know when we left the hospital \u2014
p194
aVbecause we filmed her story \u2014 we didn't know if she was going to survive.
p195
aVSo, it was obviously \u2014 it was a very emotional encounter
p196
aVand left us feeling very resonant
p197
aVwith this direct experience, this one child,
p198
aVyou know, that story.
p199
aVFive months later,
p200
aVwe went back to South Africa
p201
aVto meet Avelile again.
p202
aVAnd I'm getting \u2014
p203
aVthe hairs on my \u2014 I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
p204
aVThey're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
p205
aVThis is the transformation that took place.
p206
aVIsn't it extraordinary?
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VThat round of applause is actually
p211
aVfor the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
p212
aVAnd I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
p213
aVSo, I would like to say to you,
p214
aVeach one in the audience,
p215
aVif you feel that every mother
p216
aVand every child in the world
p217
aVhas the right to have access
p218
aVto good nutrition and good medical care,
p219
aVand you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,
p220
aVspecifically five and six,
p221
aVshould be absolutely committed to
p222
aVby all governments around the world \u2014
p223
aVespecially in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014
p224
aVcould you please stand up.
p225
aVI think that's fair to say,
p226
aVit's almost everyone in the hall.
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you very much.
