VThis is about a hidden corner of the labor market.
p4
aVIt's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,
p5
aVif they're to work at all.
p6
aVSo think, for instance,
p7
aVof someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,
p8
aVor somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,
p9
aVor a parent with complex child care needs.
p10
aVTheir availability for work can be such that it's,
p11
aV"A few hours today.
p12
aVMaybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."
p13
aVAnd it's extraordinarily difficult for these people
p14
aVto find the work that they so often need very badly.
p15
aVWhich is a tragedy because there are employers
p16
aVwho can use pools of very flexible local people
p17
aVbooked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.
p18
aa(lp19
VImagine that you run a cafe.
p20
aVIt's mid-morning, the place is filling up.
p21
aVYou're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.
p22
aVIf you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes
p23
aVto start in an hour's time,
p24
aVyou'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.
p25
aVThey'd have to be available at very competitive rates.
p26
aVThey'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.
p27
aVIn reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,
p28
aVso you are going to muddle by, understaffed.
p29
aVAnd it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,
p30
aVit's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.
p31
aVThere's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,
p32
aVpossibly already once they've been inducted.
p33
aa(lp34
VAt this level of the labor market,
p35
aVwhat you need is a marketplace for spare hours.
p36
aVThey do exist. Here's how they work.
p37
aVSo in this example, a distribution company has said,
p38
aVwe've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.
p39
aVShow us everyone who's available.
p40
aVIt's found 31 workers.
p41
aVEverybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.
p42
aVThey're all contactable in time for this booking.
p43
aVThey've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.
p44
aVAnd this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.
p45
aVAnd they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.
p46
aVOf course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.
p47
aVYou can select as many of them as you want.
p48
aVThey're from multiple agencies.
p49
aVIt's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.
p50
aVAnd it's monitoring their reliability.
p51
aVThe people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.
p52
aVThey're likely to be more expensive.
p53
aVIn an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,
p54
aVhere's a market research company,
p55
aVand it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.
p56
aVAnd they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.
p57
aVAnd they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted
p58
aVare available each hour next week.
p59
aVAnd they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut is there more that could be done
p62
aVfor this corner of the labor market?
p63
aVBecause right now there are so many people
p64
aVwho need whatever economic opportunity they can get.
p65
aVLet's make it personal.
p66
aVImagine that a young woman \u2014 base of the economic pyramid,
p67
aVvery little prospect of getting a job \u2014
p68
aVwhat economic activity could she theoretically engage in?
p69
aVWell, she might be willing to work odd hours
p70
aVin a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.
p71
aVShe may be interested in providing local services to her community:
p72
aVbabysitting, local deliveries, pet care.
p73
aVShe may have possessions that she would like to trade
p74
aVat times she doesn't need them.
p75
aVSo she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.
p76
aVShe might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.
p77
aVAnd you're probably thinking \u2014 because you're all very web-aware \u2014
p78
aVyes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,
p79
aVso she can go online and do all this.
p80
aVShe can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,
p81
aVshe can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.
p82
aa(lp83
VThese are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.
p84
aVAnd the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.
p85
aVMarkets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,
p86
aVbut only for organizations at the top of the economy.
p87
aVIf you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted
p88
aVthat you sell your financial assets in a system of markets
p89
aVthat identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,
p90
aVexecutes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.
p91
aVIt analyzes supply and demand and pricing
p92
aVand tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.
p93
aVIt manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.
p94
aVIt's all extremely low overhead.
p95
aVWhat have we gained at the bottom of the economy
p96
aVin terms of markets in the last 20 years?
p97
aVBasically classified adverts with a search facility.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo why do we have this disparity
p100
aVbetween these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy
p101
aVthat are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource
p102
aVout of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,
p103
aVand what the rest of us have?
p104
aVA modern market is more than a website;
p105
aVit's a web of interoperable marketplaces,
p106
aVback office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,
p107
aVsettlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.
p108
aVAnd when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,
p109
aVshe does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today
p110
aVand then post that listing on multiple websites
p111
aVand wait for potential buyers to get in touch
p112
aVand start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.
p113
aa(lp114
VIn the early days of this modern markets technology,
p115
aVthe financial institutions worked out
p116
aVhow they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,
p117
aVtheir relationships, their networks
p118
aVto shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.
p119
aVThey asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,
p120
aVand in a lot of cases they got it.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut throughout the economy,
p123
aVthere are facilities that could likewise leverage
p124
aVa new generation of markets
p125
aVfor the benefit of all of us.
p126
aVAnd those facilities \u2014
p127
aVI'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,
p128
aVthe licensing authorities
p129
aVthat know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,
p130
aVthe processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.
p131
aVThese mechanisms, these facilities
p132
aVare not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,
p133
aVthey're controlled by the state.
p134
aVAnd the policymakers who sit on top of them
p135
aVare, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used
p136
aVto underpin a whole new era of markets.
p137
aa(lp138
VLike everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted
p139
aVthat modern markets are the preserve
p140
aVof organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.
p141
aVSuppose we stopped taking that for granted.
p142
aVSuppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,
p143
aVor the leader of any other developed nation,
p144
aVwoke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create
p145
aVall the jobs I need in the current climate.
p146
aVI have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.
p147
aVAnd for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.
p148
aVHow do I make that happen?"
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I think I can see a few eyes rolling.
p151
aVPoliticians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?
p152
aVOh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.
p153
aVNot necessarily.
p154
aVThere is a precedent for technology-enabled service
p155
aVthat has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries
p156
aVand has been hugely successful:
p157
aVnational lotteries.
p158
aa(lp159
VLet's take Britain as an example.
p160
aVOur government didn't design the national lottery,
p161
aVit didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
p162
aVIt simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.
p163
aVThis act defines what a national lottery will look like.
p164
aVIt specifies certain benefits
p165
aVthat the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
p166
aVAnd it puts some obligations on those operators.
p167
aVIn terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,
p168
aVthis was an unqualified success.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut let's suppose that our aim
p171
aVis to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.
p172
aVCould we use the same model?
p173
aVI believe we could.
p174
aVSo imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.
p175
aVLet's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
p176
aVThink of it as a regulated public utility.
p177
aVSo it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
p178
aVAnd it's a series of markets for low-level trade
p179
aVthat can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
p180
aVAnd government has certain benefits
p181
aVit can uniquely bestow on these markets.
p182
aVIt's about public spending going through these markets
p183
aVto buy public services at the local level.
p184
aVIt's about interfacing these markets
p185
aVdirect into the highest official channels in the land.
p186
aVIt's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.
p187
aVIt's about deregulating some sectors
p188
aVso that local people can enter them.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo, taxi journeys might be one example.
p191
aVAnd there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits
p192
aVto be placed on the operators,
p193
aVand the key one is, of course,
p194
aVthat the operators pay for everything,
p195
aVincluding all the interfacing into the public sector.
p196
aVSo imagine that the operators make their return
p197
aVby building a percentage markup into each transaction.
p198
aVImagine that there's a concession period
p199
aVdefined of maybe 15 years
p200
aVin which they can take all these benefits and run with them.
p201
aVAnd imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,
p202
aVwhoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction
p203
aVto fund the whole thing
p204
aVwill get the deal.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo government then exits the frame.
p207
aVThis is now in the hands of the consortium.
p208
aVEither they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity
p209
aVand make a percentage on all of it
p210
aVor it's all going to crash and burn,
p211
aVwhich is tough on their shareholders.
p212
aVIt doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.
p213
aVAnd there would be no constraints on alternative markets.
p214
aVSo this would just be one more choice
p215
aVamong millions of Internet forums.
p216
aVBut it could be very different,
p217
aVbecause having access to those state-backed facilities
p218
aVcould incentivize this consortium
p219
aVto seriously invest in the service.
p220
aVBecause they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going
p221
aVto start making their return.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we're talking about sectors like home hair care,
p224
aVthe hire of toys, farm work,
p225
aVhire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,
p226
aVservices for tourists, home care.
p227
aVThis would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,
p228
aVbecause national e-markets will deliver data.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo this is a local person
p231
aVpotentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.
p232
aVAnd they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training
p233
aVif they wanted to go into that market.
p234
aVThey'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents
p235
aVwho wanted a pool of babysitters.
p236
aVIs it worth their while?
p237
aVShould they be looking at other sectors?
p238
aVShould they be moving to another part of the country
p239
aVwhere there's a shortage of babysitters?
p240
aVThis kind of data can become routine.
p241
aVAnd this data can be used by investors.
p242
aVSo if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country
p243
aVand the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,
p244
aVan investor can pay for it
p245
aVand the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals
p246
aVfor maybe the next two years.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is a world of atomized capitalism.
p249
aVSo it's small trades by small people,
p250
aVbut it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.
p251
aVSome rough research suggests this could unlock
p252
aVaround 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity
p253
aVin a country the size of the U.K.
p254
aa(lp255
VDoes that sound improbable to you?
p256
aVThat's what a lot of people said about turbo trading
p257
aVin financial exchanges 20 years ago.
p258
aVDo not underestimate the transformative power
p259
aVof truly modern markets.
p260
aa(lp261
