VYou may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise
p4
aVbeing 72 virgins,
p5
aVand I promise I will come back to those virgins.
p6
aVBut in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close
p7
aVto the real Koranic idea of paradise,
p8
aVdefined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams."
p9
aVSince I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union,
p10
aVthis makes perfect sense to me.
p11
aVBut the thing is, how come it's news to most people?
p12
aVI know many well-intentioned non-Muslims
p13
aVwho've begun reading the Koran, but given up,
p14
aVdisconcerted by its "otherness."
p15
aVThe historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad
p16
aVone of the world's greatest heroes,
p17
aVyet even he called the Koran
p18
aV"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble."
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VPart of the problem, I think, is that we imagine
p23
aVthat the Koran can be read as we usually read a book \u2014
p24
aVas though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon
p25
aVwith a bowl of popcorn within reach,
p26
aVas though God \u2014
p27
aVand the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad \u2014
p28
aVwere just another author on the best-seller list.
p29
aVYet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran
p30
aVis precisely why it's so easy to quote \u2014 that is, to misquote.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VPhrases and snippets taken out of context
p35
aVin what I call the "highlighter version,"
p36
aVwhich is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists
p37
aVand anti-Muslim Islamophobes.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo this past spring,
p40
aVas I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad,
p41
aVI realized I needed to read the Koran properly \u2014
p42
aVas properly as I could, that is.
p43
aVMy Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary,
p44
aVso I took four well-known translations
p45
aVand decided to read them side by side, verse by verse,
p46
aValong with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic.
p47
aVNow, I did have an advantage.
p48
aVMy last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,
p49
aVand for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories,
p50
aVso I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers,
p51
aVits frame of reference.
p52
aVI knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran \u2014
p53
aVan informed one,
p54
aVan experienced one, even,
p55
aVbut still an outsider,
p56
aVan agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I read slowly.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VI'd set aside three weeks for this project,
p65
aVand that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" \u2014
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
Vbecause it turned out to be three months.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VI did resist the temptation to skip to the back,
p74
aVwhere the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.
p75
aVBut every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran \u2014
p76
aVthat feeling of "I get it now" \u2014
p77
aVit would slip away overnight,
p78
aVand I'd come back in the morning,
p79
aVwondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land.
p80
aVAnd yet, the terrain was very familiar.
p81
aVThe Koran declares that it comes to renew the message
p82
aVof the Torah and the Gospels.
p83
aVSo one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures
p84
aVlike Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.
p85
aVGod himself was utterly familiar
p86
aVfrom his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,
p87
aVjealously insisting on no other gods.
p88
aVThe presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs
p89
aVtook me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert.
p90
aVAnd then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it,
p91
aVreminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders
p92
aVrecite hours-long narrative poems
p93
aVentirely from memory.
p94
aVAnd I began to grasp why it's said
p95
aVthat the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.
p96
aa(lp97
VTake the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter
p98
aVthat is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.
p99
aVIt's just 29 words in Arabic,
p100
aVbut anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.
p101
aVAnd yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.
p102
aVThe Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality
p103
aVthat begs to be heard rather than read,
p104
aVfelt more than analyzed.
p105
aVIt wants to be chanted out loud,
p106
aVto sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.
p107
aVSo the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself,
p108
aVor as Arthur Arberry called his version,
p109
aV"an interpretation."
p110
aVBut all is not lost in translation.
p111
aa(lp112
VAs the Koran promises, patience is rewarded,
p113
aVand there are many surprises \u2014
p114
aVa degree of environmental awareness, for instance,
p115
aVand of humans as mere stewards of God's creation,
p116
aVunmatched in the Bible.
p117
aVAnd where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men,
p118
aVusing the second- and third-person masculine,
p119
aVthe Koran includes women \u2014
p120
aVtalking, for instance,
p121
aVof believing men and believing women,
p122
aVhonorable men and honorable women.
p123
aVOr take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers.
p124
aVYes, it does say that,
p125
aVbut in a very specific context:
p126
aVthe anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca,
p127
aVwhere fighting was usually forbidden.
p128
aVAnd the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers.
p129
aVNot "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"
p130
aVbut you can, you are allowed to,
p131
aVbut only after a grace period is over,
p132
aVand only if there's no other pact in place,
p133
aVand only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba,
p134
aVand only if they attack you first.
p135
aVAnd even then \u2014 God is merciful;
p136
aVforgiveness is supreme \u2014
p137
aVand so, essentially,
p138
aVbetter if you don't.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VThis was perhaps the biggest surprise \u2014
p143
aVhow flexible the Koran is,
p144
aVat least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.
p145
aa(lp146
V"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says,
p147
aV"and others are ambiguous."
p148
aVThe perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities,
p149
aVtrying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own.
p150
aVOnly God knows the true meaning.
p151
aVThe phrase "God is subtle" appears again and again,
p152
aVand indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle
p153
aVthan most of us have been led to believe.
p154
aVAs in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise.
p155
aVOld-fashioned orientalism comes into play here.
p156
aVThe word used four times is "houris,"
p157
aVrendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts,
p158
aVor as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
p159
aVYet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris.
p160
aVNot a swelling breast or high bosom in sight.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VNow this may be a way of saying "pure beings," like in angels,
p165
aVor it may be like the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"
p166
aVan eternal youth.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut the truth is, nobody really knows.
p169
aVAnd that's the point.
p170
aVBecause the Koran is quite clear
p171
aVwhen it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise,"
p172
aVand that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you,"
p173
aVwhich seems to me a far more appealing prospect
p174
aVthan a virgin.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd that number 72 never appears.
p179
aVThere are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
p180
aVThat idea only came into being 300 years later,
p181
aVand most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent
p182
aVof people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.
p183
aVParadise is quite the opposite.
p184
aVIt's not virginity;
p185
aVit's fecundity;
p186
aVit's plenty.
p187
aVIt's gardens watered by running streams.
p188

VThank you.
