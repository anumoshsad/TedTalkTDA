VThe world is changing
p4
aVin some really profound ways,
p5
aVand I worry that investors
p6
aVaren't paying enough attention
p7
aVto some of the biggest drivers of change,
p8
aVespecially when it comes to sustainability.
p9
aVAnd by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,
p10
aVlike environmental and social issues
p11
aVand corporate governance.
p12
aVI think it's reckless to ignore these things,
p13
aVbecause doing so can jeopardize
p14
aVfuture long-term returns.
p15
aVAnd here's something that may surprise you:
p16
aVthe balance of power to really influence sustainability
p17
aVrests with institutional investors,
p18
aVthe large investors like pension funds,
p19
aVfoundations and endowments.
p20
aVI believe that sustainable investing
p21
aVis less complicated than you think,
p22
aVbetter-performing than you believe,
p23
aVand more important than we can imagine.
p24
aa(lp25
VLet me remind you what we already know.
p26
aVWe have a population that's both growing and aging;
p27
aVwe have seven billion souls today
p28
aVheading to 10 billion
p29
aVat the end of the century;
p30
aVwe consume natural resources
p31
aVfaster than they can be replenished;
p32
aVand the emissions that are mainly responsible
p33
aVfor climate change just keep increasing.
p34
aVNow clearly, these are environmental and social issues,
p35
aVbut that's not all.
p36
aVThey're economic issues,
p37
aVand that makes them relevant
p38
aVto risk and return.
p39
aVAnd they are really complex
p40
aVand they can seem really far off,
p41
aVthat the temptation may be to do this:
p42
aVbury our heads in the sand and not think about it.
p43
aVResist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VBut it makes me wonder
p47
aVif the investment rules of today
p48
aVare fit for purpose tomorrow.
p49
aVWe know that investors,
p50
aVwhen they look at a company and decide whether to invest,
p51
aVthey look at financial data,
p52
aVmetrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,
p53
aVvaluation \u2014 you know, the really sexy stuff.
p54
aVAnd these things are fundamental, of course,
p55
aVbut they're not enough.
p56
aVInvestors should also look at performance metrics
p57
aVin what we call ESG:
p58
aVenvironment, social and governance.
p59
aVEnvironment includes energy consumption,
p60
aVwater availability, waste and pollution,
p61
aVjust making efficient uses of resources.
p62
aVSocial includes human capital,
p63
aVthings like employee engagement
p64
aVand innovation capacity,
p65
aVas well as supply chain management
p66
aVand labor rights and human rights.
p67
aVAnd governance relates to the oversight
p68
aVof companies by their boards and investors.
p69
aVSee, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.
p70
aVBut ESG is the measure of sustainability,
p71
aVand sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors
p72
aVwith financial factors into the investment process.
p73
aVIt means limiting future risk
p74
aVby minimizing harm to people and planet,
p75
aVand it means providing capital to users
p76
aVwho deploy it towards productive
p77
aVand sustainable outcomes.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo if sustainability matters financially today,
p80
aVand all signs indicate more tomorrow,
p81
aVis the private sector paying attention?
p82
aVWell, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.
p83
aVThey started to see sustainability
p84
aVnot just as important but crucial to business success.
p85
aVAbout 80 percent of global CEOs
p86
aVsee sustainability as the root to growth in innovation
p87
aVand leading to competitive advantage
p88
aVin their industries.
p89
aVBut 93 percent see ESG as the future,
p90
aVor as important to the future of their business.
p91
aVSo the views of CEOs are clear.
p92
aVThere's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo how are companies actually leveraging ESG
p95
aVto drive hard business results?
p96
aVOne example is near and dear to our hearts.
p97
aVIn 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications
p98
aVto the cloud environment,
p99
aVand we retired another 85.
p100
aVWe virtualized our operating system environments,
p101
aVand we completed numerous automation projects.
p102
aVNow these initiatives create a more mobile workplace,
p103
aVand they reduce our real estate footprint,
p104
aVand they yield savings of 23 million dollars
p105
aVin operating costs annually,
p106
aVand avoid the emissions
p107
aVof a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.
p108
aVThat's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars
p109
aVoff the road.
p110
aVSo awesome, right?
p111
aVAnother example is Pentair.
p112
aVPentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,
p113
aVand about a decade ago,
p114
aVthey sold their core power tools business
p115
aVand reinvested those proceeds in a water business.
p116
aVThat's a really big bet. Why did they do that?
p117
aVWell, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,
p118
aVthere's more growth in water than in power tools,
p119
aVand this company has their sights set
p120
aVon what they call "the new New World."
p121
aVThat's four billion middle class people
p122
aVdemanding food, energy and water.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, you may be asking yourself,
p125
aVare these just isolated cases?
p126
aVI mean, come on, really?
p127
aVDo companies that take sustainability into account
p128
aVreally do well financially?
p129
aVThe answer that may surprise you is yes.
p130
aVThe data shows that stocks with better ESG performance
p131
aVperform just as well as others.
p132
aVIn blue, we see the MSCI World.
p133
aVIt's an index of large companies
p134
aVfrom developed markets across the world.
p135
aVAnd in gold, we see a subset of companies
p136
aVrated as having the best ESG performance.
p137
aVOver three plus years, no performance tradeoff.
p138
aVSo that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.
p139
aVIn some cases, there may be outperformance
p140
aVfrom ESG.
p141
aVIn blue, we see the performance
p142
aVof the 500 largest global companies,
p143
aVand in gold, we see a subset of companies
p144
aVwith best practice in climate change strategy
p145
aVand risk management.
p146
aVNow over almost eight years,
p147
aVthey've outperformed by about two thirds.
p148
aVSo yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.
p149
aVBut it does illustrate that environmental leadership
p150
aVis compatible with good returns.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo if the returns are the same or better
p153
aVand the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?
p154
aVAre investors, particularly institutional investors,
p155
aVengaged?
p156
aVWell, some are,
p157
aVand a few are really at the vanguard.
p158
aVHesta.
p159
aVHesta is a retirement fund for health
p160
aVand community services employees in Australia,
p161
aVwith assets of 22 billion [dollars].
p162
aVThey believe that ESG has the potential
p163
aVto impact risks and returns,
p164
aVso incorporating it into the investment process
p165
aVis core to their duty
p166
aVto act in the best interest of fund members,
p167
aVcore to their duty.
p168
aVYou gotta love the Aussies, right?
p169
aVCalPERS is another example.
p170
aVCalPERS is the pension fund
p171
aVfor public employees in California,
p172
aVand with assets of 244 billion [dollars],
p173
aVthey are the second largest in the U.S.
p174
aVand the sixth largest in the world.
p175
aVNow, they're moving toward 100 percent
p176
aVsustainable investment
p177
aVby systematically integrated ESG
p178
aVacross the entire fund.
p179
aVWhy? They believe it's critical
p180
aVto superior long-term returns, full stop.
p181
aVIn their own words, "long-term value creation
p182
aVrequires the effective management
p183
aVof three forms of capital:
p184
aVfinancial, human, and physical.
p185
aVThis is why we are concerned with ESG."
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, I do speak to a lot of investors
p188
aVas part of my job,
p189
aVand not all of them see it this way.
p190
aVOften I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,
p191
aVso we don't do that here,"
p192
aVor, "We don't want to use the portfolio
p193
aVto make policy statements."
p194
aVThe one that just really gets under my skin is,
p195
aV"If you want to do something about that,
p196
aVjust make money, give the profits to charities."
p197
aVIt's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.
p198
aa(lp199
VI mean, let me clarify something right here.
p200
aVCompanies and investors are not
p201
aVsingularly responsible for the fate of the planet.
p202
aVThey don't have indefinite social obligations,
p203
aVand prudent investing and finance theory
p204
aVaren't subordinate to sustainability.
p205
aVThey're compatible.
p206
aVSo I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.
p207
aVBut institutional investors
p208
aVare the x-factor in sustainability.
p209
aVWhy do they hold the key?
p210
aVThe answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVA lot of it.
p213
aVI mean, a really lot of it.
p214
aVThe global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.
p215
aVThe global bond market, 78 trillion.
p216
aVThat's 133 trillion combined.
p217
aVThat's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
p218
aVThat's the world's largest economy.
p219
aVThat's some serious freaking firepower.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo we can reconsider
p222
aVsome of these pressing challenges,
p223
aVlike fresh water, clean air,
p224
aVfeeding 10 billion mouths,
p225
aVif institutional investors
p226
aVintegrated ESG into investment.
p227
aVWhat if they used that firepower
p228
aVto allocate more of their capital
p229
aVto companies working the hardest
p230
aVat solving these challenges
p231
aVor at least not exacerbating them?
p232
aVWhat if we work and save and invest,
p233
aVonly to find that the world we retire into
p234
aVis more stressed and less secure than it is now?
p235
aVWhat if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
p236
aa(lp237
VNow a fair question might be,
p238
aVwhat if all this sustainability risk stuff
p239
aVis exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,
p240
aVsomething for virtuous consumers
p241
aVor lifestyle choice?
p242
aVWell, President John F. Kennedy said something
p243
aVabout this that is just spot on:
p244
aV"There are risks and costs to a program of action,
p245
aVbut they are far less than the long-range risks
p246
aVand costs of comfortable inaction."
p247
aVI can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,
p248
aVbut since this is based on widespread scientific consensus,
p249
aVthe odds that it's not completely wrong
p250
aVare better than the odds
p251
aVthat our house will burn down
p252
aVor we'll get in a car accident.
p253
aVWell, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)
p254
aVBut my point is that we buy insurance
p255
aVto protect ourselves financially
p256
aVin case those things happen, right?
p257
aVSo by investing sustainably
p258
aVwe're doing two things.
p259
aVWe're creating insurance,
p260
aVreducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,
p261
aVand at the same time, in the short term,
p262
aVwe're not sacrificing performance.
p263
aV[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax  and we create a better world for nothing?"]
p264
aa(lp265
VGood, you like it. I like it too.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVI like it because it pokes fun
p268
aVat both sides of the climate change issue.
p269
aVI bet you can't guess which side I'm on.
p270
aVBut what I really like about it
p271
aVis that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,
p272
aVwhich is, "Plan for the future,
p273
aVbecause that's where you're going to spend
p274
aVthe rest of your life."
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.
