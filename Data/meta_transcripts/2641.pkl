VLike many of us,
p4
aVI've had several careers in my life,
p5
aVand although they've been varied,
p6
aVmy first job set the foundation for all of them.
p7
aVI was a home-birth midwife throughout my 20s.
p8
aVDelivering babies taught me valuable and sometimes surprising things,
p9
aVlike how to start a car at 2am.
p10
aVwhen it's 10 degrees below zero.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VOr how to revive a father who's fainted at the sight of blood.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VOr how to cut the umbilical cord just so,
p19
aVto make a beautiful belly button.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut those aren't the things that stuck with me or guided me
p22
aVwhen I stopped being a midwife and started other jobs.
p23
aVWhat stuck with me was this bedrock belief
p24
aVthat each one of us comes into this world with a unique worth.
p25
aVWhen I looked into the face of a newborn,
p26
aVI caught a glimpse of that worthiness,
p27
aVthat sense of unapologetic selfhood,
p28
aVthat unique spark.
p29
aVI use the word "soul" to describe that spark,
p30
aVbecause it's the only word in English that comes close to naming
p31
aVwhat each baby brought into the room.
p32
aa(lp33
VEvery newborn was as singular as a snowflake,
p34
aVa matchless mash-up of biology
p35
aVand ancestry and mystery.
p36
aVAnd then that baby grows up,
p37
aVand in order to fit into the family,
p38
aVto conform to the culture,
p39
aVto the community, to the gender,
p40
aVthat little one begins to cover its soul,
p41
aVlayer by layer.
p42
aVWe're born this way,
p43
aVbut \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut as we grow, a lot of things happen to us
p48
aVthat make us ...
p49
aVwant to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity.
p50
aVWe've all done this.
p51
aVEveryone in this room is a former baby \u2014
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
Vwith a distinctive birthright.
p56
aVBut as adults, we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,
p57
aVlike we have ADD: authenticity deficit disorder.
p58
aVBut not those babies \u2014
p59
aVnot yet.
p60
aVTheir message to me was:
p61
aVuncover your soul
p62
aVand look for that soul-spark
p63
aVin everyone else.
p64
aVIt's still there.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd here's what I learned from laboring women.
p67
aVTheir message was about staying open,
p68
aVeven when things are painful.
p69
aVA woman's cervix normally looks like this.
p70
aVIt's a tight little muscle
p71
aVat the base of the uterus.
p72
aVAnd during labor, it has to stretch from this
p73
aVto this.
p74
aVOuch!
p75
aVIf you fight against that pain,
p76
aVyou just create more pain,
p77
aVand you block what wants to be born.
p78
aa(lp79
VI'll never forget the magic that would happen
p80
aVwhen a woman stopped resisting the pain
p81
aVand opened.
p82
aVIt was as if the forces of the universe took notice
p83
aVand sent in a wave of help.
p84
aVI never forgot that message,
p85
aVand now, when difficult or painful things happen to me
p86
aVin my life or my work,
p87
aVof course at first I resist them,
p88
aVbut then I remember what I learned from the mothers:
p89
aVstay open.
p90
aVStay curious.
p91
aVAsk the pain what it's come to deliver.
p92
aVSomething new wants to be born.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd there was one more big soulful lesson,
p95
aVand that one I learned from Albert Einstein.
p96
aVHe wasn't at any of the births, but \u2014
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VIt was a lesson about time.
p101
aVAt the end of his life, Albert Einstein concluded
p102
aVthat our normal, hamster-wheel experience of life
p103
aVis an illusion.
p104
aVWe run round and round, faster and faster,
p105
aVtrying to get somewhere.
p106
aVAnd all the while,
p107
aVunderneath surface time is this whole other dimension
p108
aVwhere the past and the present and the future merge
p109
aVand become deep time.
p110
aVAnd there's nowhere to get to.
p111
aa(lp112
VAlbert Einstein called this state, this dimension,
p113
aV"only being."
p114
aVAnd he said when he experienced it,
p115
aVhe knew sacred awe.
p116
aVWhen I was delivering babies,
p117
aVI was forced off the hamster wheel.
p118
aVSometimes I had to sit for days, hours and hours,
p119
aVjust breathing with the parents;
p120
aVjust being.
p121
aVAnd I got a big dose of sacred awe.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo those are the three lessons I took with me from midwifery.
p124
aVOne: uncover your soul.
p125
aVTwo: when things get difficult or painful, try to stay open.
p126
aVAnd three: every now and then, step off your hamster wheel
p127
aVinto deep time.
p128
aa(lp129
VThose lessons have served me throughout my life,
p130
aVbut they really served me recently,
p131
aVwhen I took on the most important job of my life thus far.
p132
aa(lp133
VTwo years ago, my younger sister came out of remission
p134
aVfrom a rare blood cancer,
p135
aVand the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant.
p136
aVAnd against the odds, we found a match for her,
p137
aVwho turned out to be me.
p138
aVI come from a family of four girls,
p139
aVand when my sisters found out that I was my sister's perfect genetic match,
p140
aVtheir reaction was, "Really? You?"
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
V"A perfect match for her?"
p145
aVWhich is pretty typical for siblings.
p146
aVIn a sibling society, there's lots of things.
p147
aVThere's love and there's friendship and there's protection.
p148
aVBut there's also jealousy
p149
aVand competition
p150
aVand rejection and attack.
p151
aVIn siblinghood, that's where we start assembling many of those first layers
p152
aVthat cover our soul.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhen I discovered I was my sister's match,
p155
aVI went into research mode.
p156
aVAnd I discovered that
p157
aVthe premise of transplants is pretty straightforward.
p158
aVYou destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient
p159
aVwith massive doses of chemotherapy,
p160
aVand then you replace that marrow
p161
aVwith several million healthy marrow cells from a donor.
p162
aVAnd then you do everything you can
p163
aVto make sure that those new cells engraft in the patient.
p164
aVI also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger.
p165
aVIf my sister made it through the near-lethal chemotherapy,
p166
aVshe still would face other challenges.
p167
aVMy cells
p168
aVmight attack her body.
p169
aVAnd her body might reject my cells.
p170
aVThey call this rejection or attack,
p171
aVand both could kill her.
p172
aa(lp173
VRejection. Attack.
p174
aVThose words had a familiar ring
p175
aVin the context of being siblings.
p176
aVMy sister and I had a long history of love,
p177
aVbut we also had a long history of rejection and attack,
p178
aVfrom minor misunderstandings to bigger betrayals.
p179
aVWe didn't have the kind of the relationship
p180
aVwhere we talked about the deeper stuff;
p181
aVbut, like many siblings and like people in all kinds of relationships,
p182
aVwe were hesitant to tell our truths,
p183
aVto reveal our wounds,
p184
aVto admit our wrongdoings.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut when I learned about the dangers of rejection or attack,
p187
aVI thought, it's time to change this.
p188
aVWhat if we left the bone marrow transplant up to the doctors,
p189
aVbut did something that we later came to call our "soul marrow transplant?"
p190
aVWhat if we faced any pain we had caused each other,
p191
aVand instead of rejection or attack,
p192
aVcould we listen?
p193
aVCould we forgive?
p194
aVCould we merge?
p195
aVWould that teach our cells to do the same?
p196
aa(lp197
VTo woo my skeptical sister, I turned to my parents' holy text:
p198
aVthe New Yorker Magazine.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VI sent her a cartoon from its pages
p203
aVas a way of explaining why we should visit a therapist
p204
aVbefore having my bone marrow harvested and transplanted into her body.
p205
aVHere it is.
p206
aa(lp207
V"I have never forgiven him for that thing I made up in my head."
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VI told my sister
p212
aVwe had probably been doing the same thing,
p213
aVcarting around made-up stories in our heads that kept us separate.
p214
aVAnd I told her that after the transplant,
p215
aVall of the blood flowing in her veins
p216
aVwould be my blood,
p217
aVmade from my marrow cells,
p218
aVand that inside the nucleus of each of those cells
p219
aVis a complete set of my DNA.
p220
aV"I will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life,"
p221
aVI told my slightly horrified sister.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
V"I think we better clean up our relationship."
p226
aa(lp227
VA health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things,
p228
aVlike quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane
p229
aVand, in the case of my sister,
p230
aVsaying "yes" to several therapy sessions,
p231
aVduring which we got down to the marrow.
p232
aVWe looked at and released years of stories
p233
aVand assumptions about each other
p234
aVand blame and shame
p235
aVuntil all that was left was love.
p236
aa(lp237
VPeople have said I was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest,
p238
aVbut I don't think so.
p239
aVWhat felt brave to me
p240
aVwas that other kind of harvest and transplant,
p241
aVthe soul marrow transplant,
p242
aVgetting emotionally naked with another human being,
p243
aVputting aside pride and defensiveness,
p244
aVlifting the layers
p245
aVand sharing with each other our vulnerable souls.
p246
aVI called on those midwife lessons:
p247
aVuncover your soul.
p248
aVOpen to what's scary and painful.
p249
aVLook for the sacred awe.
p250
aa(lp251
VHere I am with my marrow cells after the harvest.
p252
aVThat's they call it \u2014 "harvest,"
p253
aVlike it's some kind of bucolic farm-to-table event \u2014
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VWhich I can assure you it is not.
p258
aVAnd here is my brave, brave sister
p259
aVreceiving my cells.
p260
aVAfter the transplant, we began to spend more and more time together.
p261
aVIt was as if we were little girls again.
p262
aVThe past and the present merged.
p263
aVWe entered deep time.
p264
aVI left the hamster wheel of work and life
p265
aVto join my sister
p266
aVon that lonely island
p267
aVof illness and healing.
p268
aVWe spent months together \u2014
p269
aVin the isolation unit,
p270
aVin the hospital and in her home.
p271
aa(lp272
VOur fast-paced society
p273
aVdoes not support or even value this kind of work.
p274
aVWe see it as a disruption of real life and important work.
p275
aVWe worry about the emotional drain and the financial cost \u2014
p276
aVand, yes, there is a financial cost.
p277
aVBut I was paid
p278
aVin the kind of currency our culture seems to have forgotten all about.
p279
aVI was paid in love.
p280
aVI was paid in soul.
p281
aVI was paid in my sister.
p282
aa(lp283
VMy sister said the year after transplant was the best year of her life,
p284
aVwhich was surprising.
p285
aVShe suffered so much.
p286
aVBut she said life never tasted as sweet,
p287
aVand that because of the soul-baring
p288
aVand the truth-telling we had done with each other,
p289
aVshe became more unapologetically herself
p290
aVwith everyone.
p291
aVShe said things she'd always needed to say.
p292
aVShe did things she always wanted to do.
p293
aVThe same happened for me.
p294
aVI became braver about being authentic with the people in my life.
p295
aVI said my truths,
p296
aVbut more important than that, I sought the truth of others.
p297
aa(lp298
VIt wasn't until the final chapter of this story
p299
aVthat I realized just how well midwifery had trained me.
p300
aVAfter that best year of my sister's life,
p301
aVthe cancer came roaring back,
p302
aVand this time there was nothing more the doctors could do.
p303
aVThey gave her just a couple of months to live.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe night before my sister died,
p306
aVI sat by her bedside.
p307
aVShe was so small and thin.
p308
aVI could see the blood pulsing in her neck.
p309
aVIt was my blood, her blood, our blood.
p310
aVWhen she died, part of me would die, too.
p311
aa(lp312
VI tried to make sense of it all,
p313
aVhow becoming one with each other
p314
aVhad made us more ourselves,
p315
aVour soul selves,
p316
aVand how by facing and opening to the pain of our past,
p317
aVwe'd finally been delivered to each other,
p318
aVand how by stepping out of time,
p319
aVwe would now be connected forever.
p320
aa(lp321
VMy sister left me with so many things,
p322
aVand I'm going to leave you now with just one of them.
p323
aVYou don't have to wait for a life-or-death situation
p324
aVto clean up the relationships that matter to you,
p325
aVto offer the marrow of your soul
p326
aVand to seek it in another.
p327
aVWe can all do this.
p328
aVWe can be like a new kind of first responder,
p329
aVlike the one to take the first courageous step
p330
aVtoward the other,
p331
aVand to do something or try to do something
p332
aVother than rejection or attack.
p333
aVWe can do this with our siblings
p334
aVand our mates
p335
aVand our friends and our colleagues.
p336
aVWe can do this with the disconnection
p337
aVand the discord all around us.
p338
aVWe can do this for the soul of the world.
p339
