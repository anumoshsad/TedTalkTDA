VSo let's start with some good news,
p4
aVand the good news has to do with what do we know
p5
aVbased on biomedical research
p6
aVthat actually has changed the outcomes
p7
aVfor many very serious diseases?
p8
aa(lp9
VLet's start with leukemia,
p10
aVacute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,
p11
aVthe most common cancer of children.
p12
aVWhen I was a student,
p13
aVthe mortality rate was about 95 percent.
p14
aVToday, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about
p15
aVa mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.
p16
aVSix thousand children each year
p17
aVwho would have previously died of this disease are cured.
p18
aVIf you want the really big numbers,
p19
aVlook at these numbers for heart disease.
p20
aVHeart disease used to be the biggest killer,
p21
aVparticularly for men in their 40s.
p22
aVToday, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality
p23
aVfrom heart disease \u2014
p24
aVremarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.
p25
aVAIDS, incredibly, has just been named,
p26
aVin the past month, a chronic disease,
p27
aVmeaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV
p28
aVis expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,
p29
aVas we said only a decade ago,
p30
aVbut is thought to live decades,
p31
aVprobably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.
p32
aVThese are just remarkable, remarkable changes
p33
aVin the outlook for some of the biggest killers.
p34
aVAnd one in particular
p35
aVthat you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,
p36
aVwhich has been, along with heart disease,
p37
aVone of the biggest killers in this country,
p38
aVis a disease in which now we know
p39
aVthat if you can get people into the emergency room
p40
aVwithin three hours of the onset,
p41
aVsome 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital
p42
aVwithout any disability whatsoever.
p43
aa(lp44
VRemarkable stories,
p45
aVgood-news stories,
p46
aVall of which boil down to understanding
p47
aVsomething about the diseases that has allowed us
p48
aVto detect early and intervene early.
p49
aVEarly detection, early intervention,
p50
aVthat's the story for these successes.
p51
aa(lp52
VUnfortunately, the news is not all good.
p53
aVLet's talk about one other story
p54
aVwhich has to do with suicide.
p55
aVNow this is, of course, not a disease, per se.
p56
aVIt's a condition, or it's a situation
p57
aVthat leads to mortality.
p58
aVWhat you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.
p59
aVThere are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.
p60
aVThat means one about every 15 minutes.
p61
aVThird most common cause of death amongst people
p62
aVbetween the ages of 15 and 25.
p63
aVIt's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize
p64
aVthat this is twice as common as homicide
p65
aVand actually more common as a source of death
p66
aVthan traffic fatalities in this country.
p67
aVNow, when we talk about suicide,
p68
aVthere is also a medical contribution here,
p69
aVbecause 90 percent of suicides
p70
aVare related to a mental illness:
p71
aVdepression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
p72
aVanorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list
p73
aVof disorders that contribute,
p74
aVand as I mentioned before, often early in life.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut it's not just the mortality from these disorders.
p77
aVIt's also morbidity.
p78
aVIf you look at disability,
p79
aVas measured by the World Health Organization
p80
aVwith something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,
p81
aVit's kind of a metric that nobody would think of
p82
aVexcept an economist,
p83
aVexcept it's one way of trying to capture what is lost
p84
aVin terms of disability from medical causes,
p85
aVand as you can see, virtually 30 percent
p86
aVof all disability from all medical causes
p87
aVcan be attributed to mental disorders,
p88
aVneuropsychiatric syndromes.
p89
aa(lp90
VYou're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.
p91
aVI mean, cancer seems far more serious.
p92
aVHeart disease seems far more serious.
p93
aVBut you can see actually they are further down this list,
p94
aVand that's because we're talking here about disability.
p95
aVWhat drives the disability for these disorders
p96
aVlike schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?
p97
aVWhy are they number one here?
p98
aa(lp99
VWell, there are probably three reasons.
p100
aVOne is that they're highly prevalent.
p101
aVAbout one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders
p102
aVin the course of their lifetime.
p103
aVA second, of course, is that, for some people,
p104
aVthese become truly disabling,
p105
aVand it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.
p106
aVBut what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,
p107
aVand to some extent the high mortality,
p108
aVis the fact that these start very early in life.
p109
aVFifty percent will have onset by age 14,
p110
aV75 percent by age 24,
p111
aVa picture that is very different than what one would see
p112
aVif you're talking about cancer or heart disease,
p113
aVdiabetes, hypertension \u2014 most of the major illnesses
p114
aVthat we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.
p115
aVThese are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.
p118
aVThis is obviously not one of them.
p119
aVThis is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,
p120
aVand in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.
p121
aVMy job is to actually make sure that we make progress
p122
aVon all of these disorders.
p123
aVI work for the federal government.
p124
aVActually, I work for you. You pay my salary.
p125
aVAnd maybe at this point, when you know what I do,
p126
aVor maybe what I've failed to do,
p127
aVyou'll think that I probably ought to be fired,
p128
aVand I could certainly understand that.
p129
aVBut what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here
p130
aVis to tell you that I think we're about to be
p131
aVin a very different world as we think about these illnesses.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhat I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,
p134
aVdiseases of the mind.
p135
aVThat's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,
p136
aVand people feel that, for whatever reason,
p137
aVit's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders
p138
aVand to talk about these as disorders of behavior.
p139
aVFair enough. They are disorders of behavior,
p140
aVand they are disorders of the mind.
p141
aVBut what I want to suggest to you
p142
aVis that both of those terms,
p143
aVwhich have been in play for a century or more,
p144
aVare actually now impediments to progress,
p145
aVthat what we need conceptually to make progress here
p146
aVis to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, for some of you, you're going to say,
p149
aV"Oh my goodness, here we go again.
p150
aVWe're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance
p151
aVor we're going to hear about drugs
p152
aVor we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion
p153
aVthat will take our subjective experience
p154
aVand turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of
p155
aVvery flat, unidimensional understanding
p156
aVof what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhen we talk about the brain, it is anything but
p159
aVunidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.
p160
aVIt depends, of course, on what scale
p161
aVor what scope you want to think about,
p162
aVbut this is an organ of surreal complexity,
p163
aVand we are just beginning to understand
p164
aVhow to even study it, whether you're thinking about
p165
aVthe 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex
p166
aVor the 100 trillion synapses
p167
aVthat make up all the connections.
p168
aVWe have just begun to try to figure out
p169
aVhow do we take this very complex machine
p170
aVthat does extraordinary kinds of information processing
p171
aVand use our own minds to understand
p172
aVthis very complex brain that supports our own minds.
p173
aVIt's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution
p174
aVthat we simply don't have a brain
p175
aVthat seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.
p176
aVIn a sense, it actually makes you feel that
p177
aVwhen you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,
p178
aVsomething you can observe,
p179
aVthat in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic
p180
aVthan trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ
p181
aVthat we're beginning to try to understand.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, already in the case of the brain disorders
p184
aVthat I've been talking to you about,
p185
aVdepression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
p186
aVpost-traumatic stress disorder,
p187
aVwhile we don't have an in-depth understanding
p188
aVof how they are abnormally processed
p189
aVor what the brain is doing in these illnesses,
p190
aVwe have been able to already identify
p191
aVsome of the connectional differences, or some of the ways
p192
aVin which the circuitry is different
p193
aVfor people who have these disorders.
p194
aVWe call this the human connectome,
p195
aVand you can think about the connectome
p196
aVsort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.
p197
aVYou'll hear more about this in a few minutes.
p198
aVThe important piece here is that as you begin to look
p199
aVat people who have these disorders, the one in five of us
p200
aVwho struggle in some way,
p201
aVyou find that there's a lot of variation
p202
aVin the way that the brain is wired,
p203
aVbut there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns
p204
aVare risk factors for developing one of these disorders.
p205
aVIt's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders
p206
aVlike Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease
p207
aVwhere you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.
p208
aVHere we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,
p209
aVor sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected
p210
aVand the way that the brain functions.
p211
aVYou could, if you want, compare this to,
p212
aVon the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,
p213
aVwhere you have dead tissue in the heart,
p214
aVversus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning
p215
aVbecause of the communication problems within it.
p216
aVEither one would kill you; in only one of them
p217
aVwill you find a major lesion.
p218
aa(lp219
VAs we think about this, probably it's better to actually go
p220
aVa little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,
p221
aVbecause I think that's a good case
p222
aVfor helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.
p223
aVThese are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues
p224
aVat the National Institute of Mental Health
p225
aVin which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,
p226
aVand you can see already in the top
p227
aVthere's areas that are red or orange, yellow,
p228
aVare places where there's less gray matter,
p229
aVand as they followed them over five years,
p230
aVcomparing them to age match controls,
p231
aVyou can see that, particularly in areas like
p232
aVthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
p233
aVor the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.
p234
aVAnd it's important, if you try to model this,
p235
aVyou can think about normal development
p236
aVas a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,
p237
aVand what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,
p238
aVand at some point, when you overshoot,
p239
aVyou cross a threshold, and it's that threshold
p240
aVwhere we say, this is a person who has this disease,
p241
aVbecause they have the behavioral symptoms
p242
aVof hallucinations and delusions.
p243
aVThat's something we can observe.
p244
aVBut look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.
p245
aVThey've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,
p246
aVthat perhaps not at age 22 or 20,
p247
aVbut even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see
p248
aVthe trajectory for development is quite different
p249
aVat the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.
p250
aa(lp251
VWhy does this matter? Well first because,
p252
aVfor brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.
p253
aVWe know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.
p254
aVThere are changes in the brain a decade or more
p255
aVbefore you see the first signs of a behavioral change.
p256
aVThe tools that we have now allow us to detect
p257
aVthese brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.
p258
aVBut most important, go back to where we started.
p259
aVThe good-news stories in medicine
p260
aVare early detection, early intervention.
p261
aVIf we waited until the heart attack,
p262
aVwe would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives
p263
aVevery year in this country to heart disease.
p264
aVThat is precisely what we do today
p265
aVwhen we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,
p266
aVbrain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.
p267
aVWe wait until the behavior becomes manifest.
p268
aVThat's not early detection. That's not early intervention.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.
p271
aVWe don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know
p272
aVwhat the tools will be,
p273
aVnor what to precisely look for in every case to be able
p274
aVto get there before the behavior emerges as different.
p275
aVBut this tells us how we need to think about it,
p276
aVand where we need to go.
p277
aa(lp278
VAre we going to be there soon?
p279
aVI think that this is something that will happen
p280
aVover the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish
p281
aVwith a quote about trying to predict how this will happen
p282
aVby somebody who's thought a lot about changes
p283
aVin concepts and changes in technology.
p284
aa(lp285
V"We always overestimate the change that will occur
p286
aVin the next two years and underestimate
p287
aVthe change that will occur in the next 10." \u2014 Bill Gates.
