VAs an archaeologist,
p4
aVI'm most often asked what my favorite discovery is.
p5
aVThe answer's easy:
p6
aVmy husband, Greg.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VWe met in Egypt on my first dig.
p11
aVIt was my first lesson in finding unexpected, wonderful things.
p12
aVThis began an incredible archaeological partnership.
p13
aVYears later, I proposed to him in front of our favorite pair statue
p14
aVof the Prince and Princess Rahotep and Nofret,
p15
aVin the Cairo Museum,
p16
aVdating to 4,600 years ago.
p17
aa(lp18
VI thought if I was going to ask Greg to spend the rest of this life with me,
p19
aVthen I should ask him in front of two people
p20
aVwho had pledged to be together for eternity.
p21
aVThese symbols endure because when we look at them,
p22
aVwe're looking at mirrors.
p23
aVThey are powerful reminders
p24
aVthat our common humanity has not changed.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love,
p27
aVbecause ancient history is the most seductive mistress imaginable.
p28
aVMany archaeologists have devoted their lives
p29
aVto unraveling the mysteries of the past
p30
aVunder hot suns
p31
aVand Arctic winds
p32
aVand in dense rainforests.
p33
aVMany seek.
p34
aVSome discover.
p35
aVAll worship at the temple of possibility
p36
aVthat one discovery might change history.
p37
aa(lp38
VOn my first day in Egypt, I worked at a site
p39
aVin the Northeast Egyptian Delta called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,
p40
aVin a cemetery.
p41
aVThat's a picture of me \u2014
p42
aVI'm just in my bliss.
p43
aVOn the dig, surrounded by emerald green rice paddies,
p44
aVI discovered an intact pot.
p45
aVFlipping it over,
p46
aVI discovered a human thumbprint left by whoever made the vessel.
p47
aVFor a moment, time stood still.
p48
aVI didn't know where I was.
p49
aVIt was because at that moment I realized,
p50
aVwhen we dig,
p51
aVwe're digging for people,
p52
aVnot things.
p53
aa(lp54
VNever are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past.
p55
aVI can't tell you how many times I've stood in front of the Pyramids of Giza,
p56
aVand they leave me speechless.
p57
aVI feel like the luckiest person in the world.
p58
aVThey're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible.
p59
aVMany cannot process their brilliance as human \u2014
p60
aVthey think aliens built them.
p61
aVBut this is ridiculous.
p62
aVAll you need to do is get up close and personal,
p63
aVand see the hidden hand of man
p64
aVin the chisel marks left by the tools that built them.
p65
aVThe Great Pyramid of Giza was built one stone at a time
p66
aVwith 2.3 million blocks,
p67
aVwith incredible bureaucratic efficiency.
p68
aVIt is not the pyramids that stand the test of time;
p69
aVit is human ingenuity.
p70
aVThat is our shared human brilliance.
p71
aVHistory may be cyclical,
p72
aVbut we are singular.
p73
aa(lp74
VI love what I do,
p75
aVbecause I learn that we haven't changed.
p76
aVI get to read about mother-in-law jokes from Mesopotamia
p77
aVfrom 3,500 years ago.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VI get to hear about neighbors cursing each other
p82
aVfrom 4,600 years ago in Egypt.
p83
aVAnd my absolute favorite, from 3,300 years ago in Luxor:
p84
aVan inscription that describes schoolboys who cut class to go drinking.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VKids these days.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI get to see the most incredible architecture,
p93
aVsee stunning sculptures \u2014
p94
aVI mean, this is basically a selfie in stone \u2014
p95
aVand see that we've always rocked serious bling.
p96
aVAnd also, we've been posting on walls
p97
aVand obsessing about cats \u2014
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
Vfor thousands of years.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VArchaeologists are the cultural memory preservers
p108
aVand the spokespeople
p109
aVfor the billions of people and the thousands of cultures
p110
aVthat came before us.
p111
aa(lp112
VGood science, imagination and a leap of faith
p113
aVare the trifecta we use to raise the dead.
p114
aVIn the last year,
p115
aVarchaeologists have made incredible discoveries, including:
p116
aVnew human ancestors from South Africa;
p117
aVtools from 3.3 million years ago \u2014
p118
aVthese are the oldest tools ever discovered \u2014
p119
aVin Kenya.
p120
aVAnd this, from a series of medical implements found
p121
aVfrom Blackbeard's ship from 1718.
p122
aVWhat you're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis.
p123
aVOuch!
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VFor each of these,
p128
aVthere are thousands of other incredibly important discoveries
p129
aVmade by my colleagues,
p130
aVthat do not make headlines.
p131
aVHowever, I believe that the most important thing we do as archaeologists
p132
aVis acknowledge that past people existed
p133
aVand lived lives worth learning about.
p134
aVCan you even imagine what the world would be like today
p135
aVif we acknowledged all human beings in this way?
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, on a dig, we have a challenge:
p138
aVit often looks like this.
p139
aVYou can't see anything.
p140
aVWhere are we going to start digging?
p141
aVThis is from a site south of Cairo.
p142
aVLet's have a look from space.
p143
aVAgain, you can't really see much.
p144
aVWhat you're looking at is a WorldView-3 satellite image,
p145
aVwhich has a .3 meter resolution.
p146
aVThat's 10 inches.
p147
aVThis means that you can zoom in from 400 miles in space
p148
aVand see your tablets.
p149
aVHow do I know about this?
p150
aVIt's because I'm a space archaeologist.
p151
aVLet me repeat that.
p152
aVI am a space archaeologist.
p153
aVThis means \u2014
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VThank you.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis means I use satellite images and process them using algorithms,
p160
aVand look at subtle differences in the light spectrum
p161
aVthat indicate buried things under the ground
p162
aVthat I get to go excavate and survey.
p163
aVBy the way \u2014
p164
aVNASA has a Space Archaeology program,
p165
aVso it's a real job.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, let's have a look again.
p170
aVWe're back at the site just south of Cairo.
p171
aVYou can't see anything.
p172
aVKeep your eye on the red rectangle.
p173
aVWhen we process the image using algorithms \u2014
p174
aVthink like a space-based CAT scan \u2014
p175
aVthis is what you see.
p176
aVThis rectilinear form is an ancient tomb
p177
aVthat is previously unknown and unexcavated,
p178
aVand you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VI believe we have barely scratched the surface
p183
aVin terms of what's left to discover.
p184
aVIn the Egyptian Delta alone,
p185
aVwe've excavated less than one-1000th of one percent
p186
aVof the total volume of Egyptian sites.
p187
aVWhen you add to that the thousands of other sites
p188
aVmy team and I have discovered,
p189
aVwhat we thought we knew pales in comparison
p190
aVto what we have left to discover.
p191
aVWhen you look at the incredible work
p192
aVthat my colleagues are doing all around the world
p193
aVand what they're finding,
p194
aVI believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites
p195
aVleft to find.
p196
aVDiscovering them will do nothing less
p197
aVthan unlock the full potential of our existence.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut we have a challenge.
p200
aVOver the last year,
p201
aVwe've seen horrible headlines
p202
aVof incredible destruction going on to archaeological sites,
p203
aVand massive looting by people like ISIL.
p204
aVISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.
p205
aVWho blows up a temple?
p206
aVThey've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.
p207
aVAnd we've seen looting at sites so rampant,
p208
aVit looks like craters of the moon.
p209
aVKnowing ISIL's desire to destroy modern human lives,
p210
aVit's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well.
p211
aVCountless invading armies have done the same throughout history.
p212
aa(lp213
VWe know that ISIL is profiting from the looting of sites,
p214
aVbut we don't know the scale.
p215
aVThis means that any object purchased on the market today
p216
aVfrom the Middle East
p217
aVcould potentially be funding terrorism.
p218
aVWhen a site is looted,
p219
aVit's as if a puzzle already missing 90 percent of it pieces
p220
aVhas had the rest obscured beyond recognition.
p221
aVThis is ancient identity theft writ large.
p222
aVWe know that there are two kinds of looting going on:
p223
aVlooting by criminal elements like ISIL,
p224
aVand then more local looting by those that are desperate for money.
p225
aVWe would all do the same to feed our families;
p226
aVI don't blame the local looters.
p227
aVI blame the middlemen, the unethical traffickers
p228
aVand an international art market
p229
aVthat exploits often ambiguous or even completely nonexistent laws.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe know looting is going on on a global scale and it's increasing,
p232
aVbut presently we don't have any tools to stop it.
p233
aVThis is beginning to change.
p234
aVMy team and I have just completed a study looking at looting in Egypt.
p235
aVWe looked at open-source data
p236
aVand mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt
p237
aVfrom 2002 to 2013.
p238
aVWe found evidence of looting and site destruction at 267 sites,
p239
aVand mapped over 200,000 looting pits.
p240
aVIt's astonishing.
p241
aVAnd putting that data together \u2014
p242
aVyou can see the looting pits marked here.
p243
aVAt one site, the looting got bad from 2009, 2011, 2012 \u2014
p244
aVhundreds and hundreds of pits.
p245
aa(lp246
VPutting all the data together,
p247
aVwhat we found is that, contrary to popular opinion,
p248
aVlooting did not start to get worse in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,
p249
aVbut in 2009, after the global recession.
p250
aVThus, we've shown with big data
p251
aVthat looting is fundamentally an economic issue.
p252
aVIf we do nothing to stop the problem,
p253
aVall of Egypt's sites will be affected by looting by 2040.
p254
aVThus, we are at a tipping point.
p255
aVWe are the generation with all the tools and all the technologies
p256
aVto stop looting,
p257
aVbut we're not working fast enough.
p258
aa(lp259
VSometimes an archaeological site can surprise you with its resilience.
p260
aVI am just back from the field,
p261
aVwhere I co-led a joint mission with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities
p262
aVat a site called Lisht.
p263
aVThis site dates to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.
p264
aVThe Middle Kingdom was Ancient Egypt's Renaissance period.
p265
aVAfter a time of intense internal strife and environmental challenges,
p266
aVEgypt rebounded
p267
aVwith an incredible resurgence of art, architecture and literature.
p268
aVIt's a favorite period of time to study in Egypt,
p269
aVbecause it teaches us so much about how we can survive and thrive
p270
aVafter great disasters.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow at this site, we had already mapped countless looting pits.
p273
aVLisht is a royal site;
p274
aVthere would have been thousands of people buried there
p275
aVwho lived and worked at the court of Pharaoh.
p276
aVYou can see this before and after; you see dozens of looting pits.
p277
aVNorth Lisht.
p278
aVThis is in South Lisht, before and after.
p279
aVWhen we first visited the site,
p280
aVwe could see the tombs of many high-ranking officials
p281
aVthat had been looted.
p282
aVLet me put into perspective for you what was taken.
p283
aVImagine a two meter by two meter area full of coffins, jewelry
p284
aVand incredible statuary.
p285
aVMultiply that times over a thousand.
p286
aVThat's what was taken.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo, when we started work,
p289
aVmy Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef, approached me and said,
p290
aV"We must work at this one particular tomb.
p291
aVIt's been attacked by looters.
p292
aVIf we don't do anything, they'll be back."
p293
aVOf course I agreed, but I didn't think we'd find anything.
p294
aVI thought the looters had stolen everything.
p295
aVWhat we started to find were the most incredible reliefs.
p296
aVLook at this painting \u2014 it's just stunning.
p297
aVWe started finding engraved inscriptions.
p298
aVAnd even the titles of the tomb owner \u2014
p299
aVhe had titles like, "Overseer of the Army,"
p300
aV"Overseer of the Treasury."
p301
aVI began to have hope.
p302
aVMaybe, just maybe we would find his name.
p303
aVFor the ancient Egyptians, having their name last for eternity
p304
aVwas their goal.
p305
aVAnd then one day,
p306
aVthis appeared.
p307
aVThis is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.
p308
aVYou can see it written out here, in hieroglyphs.
p309
aVWorking together with my Egyptian team,
p310
aVwe had restored someone's name from 3,900 years ago.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VWorking together with my Egyptian colleagues,
p315
aVwe celebrated this moment of shared discovery.
p316
aVWhat we were doing together was right and true.
p317
aVWe found this incredible false door, mostly intact.
p318
aVOn it we read about Intef and his inscriptions.
p319
aVYou can actually even see him seated here.
p320
aVWhat I realized is that everything I had assumed about looted sites
p321
aVhad been proven wrong.
p322
aa(lp323
VEvery day on site we worked together with 70 Egyptians
p324
aVas colleagues and friends.
p325
aVIn the face of so much hatred and ignorance
p326
aVagainst those in the Middle East,
p327
aVevery moment on site felt like a protest for peace.
p328
aVWhen you work with those that don't look like you,
p329
aVor think like you, or speak like you,
p330
aVyour shared mission of archaeological discovery
p331
aVerases all superficial differences.
p332
aVWhat I learned this season
p333
aVis that archaeology isn't about what you find.
p334
aVIt's about what you can prove possible.
p335
aa(lp336
VSometimes when you travel, you end up finding long-lost family \u2014
p337
aVnot those with whom you share genes,
p338
aVbut a shared entry in the book of life.
p339
aVThis is Omer Farrouk, my brother.
p340
aVOmer's a Gufti from a village just North of Luxor, called Guft.
p341
aVGuftis are part of a celebrated tradition in Egyptology.
p342
aVThey help with digging and work crew organization.
p343
aVOmer is my COO and CFO.
p344
aVI simply couldn't do work without him.
p345
aVOne day many years ago, when I was a young graduate student
p346
aVand Omer was a young Gufti who couldn't speak much English,
p347
aVwe learned, completely randomly,
p348
aVthat we were born in the same year,
p349
aVthe same month
p350
aVand the same day, six hours apart.
p351
aVTwins.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VSeparated by an ocean, but forever connected
p356
aVfor Ancient Egypt is our mother.
p357
aVI knew then we'd always work together \u2014
p358
aVnot in my brain,
p359
aVbut in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Arabic) Omer by brother,
p362
aVI will always love you.
p363
aa(lp364
V(English) Omer my brother, I will always love you.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo, just before my first dig in Egypt,
p367
aVmy mentor, the very famous Egyptologist Professor William Kelly Simpson,
p368
aVcalled me into his office.
p369
aVHe handed me a check for $2,000,
p370
aVand said, "This is to cover your expenses.
p371
aVHave a glorious adventure this summer.
p372
aVSomeday you will do this for someone else."
p373
aVThus, my TED Prize wish is partial payback, plus interest \u2014
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
Vfor a great human being's generosity and kindness.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo, my wish.
p380
aVI wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites
p381
aVaround the world.
p382
aVBy creating a 21st-century army of global explorers,
p383
aVwe'll find and protect the world's hidden heritage,
p384
aVwhich contains clues to humankind's collective resilience
p385
aVand creativity.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VSo how are we going to do this?
p394
aVWe are going to build with the TED Prize money
p395
aVan online, crowdsource, citizen science platform
p396
aVto allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering
p397
aVarchaeological sites.
p398
aVThere are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world.
p399
aVIt is my dream to engage the world
p400
aVwith helping to find sites and protect them.
p401
aVWhat you'll do is sign in, create a username \u2014
p402
aVnote that this particular username is already taken.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Laughter)
p405
aa(lp406
VYou'll take a tutorial and you'll start work.
p407
aVI want to note at the outset
p408
aVthat in no way will be sharing GPS data or mapping data for sites.
p409
aVWe want to treat them like human patient data,
p410
aVand not reveal their locations.
p411
aVYou'll then be dealt a card from a deck \u2014 20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters,
p412
aVand you'll be looking for features.
p413
aVMy team and I will have batch-processed
p414
aVlarge amounts of satellite data using algorithms
p415
aVin order for you to find things,
p416
aVso you'll be doing really good science.
p417
aa(lp418
VYou'll then be starting to look.
p419
aVWhat do you see? Do you see a temple?
p420
aVDo you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?
p421
aVDo you see any potential site damage or site looting?
p422
aVYou'll then begin to mark what's there.
p423
aVAnd off to the side are always going to be rich examples
p424
aVof exactly what you're seeing, to help guide you.
p425
aVAll the data that you help us collect will be shared with vetted authorities,
p426
aVand will help create a new global alarm system
p427
aVto help protect sites.
p428
aVBut it's not just going to stop there.
p429
aVAll the archaeologists with whom we share your discoveries
p430
aVwill take you with them as they begin to excavate them,
p431
aVby using Periscope, Google Plus and social media.
p432
aa(lp433
VA hundred years ago, archaeology was for the rich.
p434
aVFifty years ago,
p435
aVit was for men.
p436
aVNow it's primarily for academics.
p437
aVOur goal is to democratize the process of archaeological discovery,
p438
aVand allow anyone to participate.
p439
aVNinety-four years ago,
p440
aVHoward Carter discovered the tomb of King Tut.
p441
aVWho is the next Howard Carter?
p442
aVIt might be you.
p443
aa(lp444
VBy creating this platform,
p445
aVwe will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people
p446
aVthat came before us.
p447
aVIf we want to answer the big questions about who we are
p448
aVand where we've come from,
p449
aVthe answers to those questions do not lie in pyramids or palaces,
p450
aVbut in the cities and villages of those that came before us.
p451
aVIf we want to learn about the past,
p452
aVit's time we inverted the pyramids.
p453
aVAcknowledging that the past is worth saving
p454
aVmeans so much more.
p455
aVIt means that we're worth saving, too.
p456
aVAnd the greatest story ever told
p457
aVis the story of our shared human journey.
p458
aVBut the only way we're going to be able to write it
p459
aVis if we do it together.
p460
aVCome with me.
