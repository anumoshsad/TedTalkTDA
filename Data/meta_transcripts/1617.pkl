VEverything I do, and everything I do professionally \u2014
p4
aVmy life \u2014 has been shaped
p5
aVby seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
p6
aVFrom 1971 to 1977 \u2014
p7
aVI look young, but I'm not \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p8
aVI worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,
p9
aVin projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
p10
aa(lp11
VI worked for an Italian NGO,
p12
aVand every single project that we set up in Africa
p13
aVfailed.
p14
aVAnd I was distraught.
p15
aVI thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people
p16
aVand we were doing good work in Africa.
p17
aVInstead, everything we touched we killed.
p18
aa(lp19
VOur first project, the one that has inspired my first book,
p20
aV"Ripples from the Zambezi,"
p21
aVwas a project where we Italians
p22
aVdecided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.
p23
aVSo we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia
p24
aVin this absolutely magnificent valley
p25
aVgoing down to the Zambezi River,
p26
aVand we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes
p27
aVand zucchini and ...
p28
aVAnd of course the local people had absolutely no interest
p29
aVin doing that, so we paid them to come and work,
p30
aVand sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)
p31
aVAnd we were amazed that the local people,
p32
aVin such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
p33
aVBut instead of asking them how come they were not
p34
aVgrowing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)
p35
aV"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.
p38
aVWe had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato
p39
aVwould grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
p40
aVAnd we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,
p41
aV"Look how easy agriculture is."
p42
aVWhen the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,
p43
aVovernight, some 200 hippos came out from the river
p44
aVand they ate everything. (Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
V"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."
p51
aa(lp52
VI thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,
p53
aVbut then I saw what the Americans were doing,
p54
aVwhat the English were doing, what the French were doing,
p55
aVand after seeing what they were doing,
p56
aVI became quite proud of our project in Zambia.
p57
aVBecause, you see, at least we fed the hippos.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou should see the rubbish \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p60
aVYou should see the rubbish that we have bestowed
p61
aVon unsuspecting African people.
p62
aVYou want to read the book,
p63
aVread "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,
p64
aVZambian woman economist.
p65
aVThe book was published in 2009.
p66
aVWe Western donor countries have given the African continent
p67
aVtwo trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.
p68
aVI'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.
p69
aVJust go and read her book.
p70
aVRead it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,
p73
aVand there are only two ways we deal with people:
p74
aVWe either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.
p75
aVThe two words come from the Latin root "pater,"
p76
aVwhich means "father."
p77
aVBut they mean two different things.
p78
aVPaternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture
p79
aVas if they were my children. "I love you so much."
p80
aVPatronizing, I treat everybody from another culture
p81
aVas if they were my servants.
p82
aVThat's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.
p83
aa(lp84
VI was given a slap in the face reading a book,
p85
aV"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,
p86
aVabove all in economic development, if people
p87
aVdo not wish to be helped, leave them alone.
p88
aVThis should be the first principle of aid.
p89
aVThe first principle of aid is respect.
p90
aVThis morning, the gentleman who opened this conference
p91
aVlay a stick on the floor, and said,
p92
aV"Can we \u2014 can you imagine a city
p93
aVthat is not neocolonial?"
p94
aa(lp95
VI decided when I was 27 years old
p96
aVto only respond to people,
p97
aVand I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,
p98
aVwhere you never initiate anything,
p99
aVyou never motivate anybody, but you become a servant
p100
aVof the local passion, the servant of local people
p101
aVwho have a dream to become a better person.
p102
aVSo what you do \u2014 you shut up.
p103
aVYou never arrive in a community with any ideas,
p104
aVand you sit with the local people.
p105
aVWe don't work from offices.
p106
aVWe meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.
p107
aVWe have zero infrastructure.
p108
aVAnd what we do, we become friends,
p109
aVand we find out what that person wants to do.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe most important thing is passion.
p112
aVYou can give somebody an idea.
p113
aVIf that person doesn't want to do it,
p114
aVwhat are you going to do?
p115
aVThe passion that the person has for her own growth
p116
aVis the most important thing.
p117
aVThe passion that that man has for his own personal growth
p118
aVis the most important thing.
p119
aVAnd then we help them to go and find the knowledge,
p120
aVbecause nobody in the world can succeed alone.
p121
aVThe person with the idea may not have the knowledge,
p122
aVbut the knowledge is available.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo years and years ago, I had this idea:
p125
aVWhy don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community
p126
aVto tell people what to do, why don't, for once,
p127
aVlisten to them? But not in community meetings.
p128
aa(lp129
VLet me tell you a secret.
p130
aVThere is a problem with community meetings.
p131
aVEntrepreneurs never come,
p132
aVand they never tell you, in a public meeting,
p133
aVwhat they want to do with their own money,
p134
aVwhat opportunity they have identified.
p135
aVSo planning has this blind spot.
p136
aVThe smartest people in your community you don't even know,
p137
aVbecause they don't come to your public meetings.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhat we do, we work one-on-one,
p140
aVand to work one-on-one, you have to create
p141
aVa social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
p142
aVYou have to create a new profession.
p143
aVThe profession is the family doctor of enterprise,
p144
aVthe family doctor of business, who sits with you
p145
aVin your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,
p146
aVand helps you find the resources to transform your passion
p147
aVinto a way to make a living.
p148
aa(lp149
VI started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.
p150
aVI was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,
p151
aVtrying to go away from this patronizing bullshit
p152
aVthat we arrive and tell you what to do.
p153
aVAnd so what I did in Esperance that first year
p154
aVwas to just walk the streets, and in three days
p155
aVI had my first client, and I helped this first guy
p156
aVwho was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,
p157
aVand I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,
p158
aVto get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,
p159
aV"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"
p160
aVAnd I helped these five fishermen to work together
p161
aVand get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany
p162
aVfor 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way
p163
aVto take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,
p164
aVand the farmers came to talk to me, said,
p165
aV"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
p166
aVIn a year, I had 27 projects going on,
p167
aVand the government came to see me to say,
p168
aV"How can you do that?
p169
aVHow can you do \u2014 ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
p170
aVI shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p173
aVSo the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)
p174
aVWe've done it in 300 communities around the world.
p175
aVWe have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
p176
aVThere is a new generation of entrepreneurs
p177
aVwho are dying of solitude.
p178
aa(lp179
VPeter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,
p180
aVdied age 96, a few years ago.
p181
aVPeter Drucker was a professor of philosophy
p182
aVbefore becoming involved in business,
p183
aVand this is what Peter Drucker says:
p184
aV"Planning is actually incompatible
p185
aVwith an entrepreneurial society and economy."
p186
aVPlanning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo now you're rebuilding Christchurch
p189
aVwithout knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch
p190
aVwant to do with their own money and their own energy.
p191
aVYou have to learn how to get these people
p192
aVto come and talk to you.
p193
aVYou have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,
p194
aVyou have to be fantastic at helping them,
p195
aVand then they will come, and they will come in droves.
p196
aVIn a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
p197
aVCan you imagine a community of 400,000 people,
p198
aVthe intelligence and the passion?
p199
aVWhich presentation have you applauded the most this morning?
p200
aVLocal, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo what I'm saying is that
p203
aVentrepreneurship is where it's at.
p204
aVWe are at the end of the first industrial revolution \u2014
p205
aVnonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing \u2014
p206
aVand all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.
p207
aVThe internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
p208
aVFreon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.
p209
aVWhat we have to look at is at how we
p210
aVfeed, cure, educate, transport, communicate
p211
aVfor seven billion people in a sustainable way.
p212
aVThe technologies do not exist to do that.
p213
aVWho is going to invent the technology
p214
aVfor the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!
p215
aVGovernment? Forget about it!
p216
aVIt will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
p217
aa(lp218
VThere's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine
p219
aVmany, many years ago.
p220
aVThere was a group of experts who were invited
p221
aVto discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
p222
aVAnd in 1860, this group of people came together,
p223
aVand they all speculated about what would happen
p224
aVto the city of New York in 100 years,
p225
aVand the conclusion was unanimous:
p226
aVThe city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
p227
aVWhy? Because they looked at the curve and said,
p228
aVif the population keeps growing at this rate,
p229
aVto move the population of New York around,
p230
aVthey would have needed six million horses,
p231
aVand the manure created by six million horses
p232
aVwould be impossible to deal with.
p233
aVThey were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)
p234
aVSo 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology
p235
aVthat is going to choke the life out of New York.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,
p238
aVin the United States of America, there were 1,001
p239
aVcar manufacturing companies \u2014 1,001.
p240
aVThe idea of finding a different technology
p241
aVhad absolutely taken over,
p242
aVand there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.
p243
aVDearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
p244
aa(lp245
VHowever, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
p246
aVFirst, you have to offer them confidentiality.
p247
aVOtherwise they don't come and talk to you.
p248
aVThen you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,
p249
aVpassionate service to them.
p250
aVAnd then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.
p251
aVThe smallest company, the biggest company,
p252
aVhas to be capable of doing three things beautifully:
p253
aVThe product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,
p254
aVyou have to have fantastic marketing,
p255
aVand you have to have tremendous financial management.
p256
aVGuess what?
p257
aVWe have never met a single human being
p258
aVin the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.
p259
aVIt doesn't exist.
p260
aVThis person has never been born.
p261
aVWe've done the research, and we have looked
p262
aVat the 100 iconic companies of the world \u2014
p263
aVCarnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,
p264
aVall the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
p265
aVThere's only one thing that all the successful companies
p266
aVin the world have in common, only one:
p267
aVNone were started by one person.
p268
aVNow we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds
p269
aVin Northumberland, and we start the class
p270
aVby giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,
p271
aVand the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,
p272
aVin the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography
p273
aVhow many times Richard uses the word "I"
p274
aVand how many times he uses the word "we."
p275
aVNever the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.
p276
aVHe wasn't alone when he started.
p277
aVNobody started a company alone. No one.
p278
aVSo we can create the community
p279
aVwhere we have facilitators who come from a small business background
p280
aVsitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies
p281
aVwho will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman
p282
aVwho talks about this epic,
p283
aVsomebody who will say to you, "What do you need?
p284
aVWhat can you do? Can you make it?
p285
aVOkay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"
p286
aV"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"
p287
aVWe activate communities.
p288
aVWe have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator
p289
aVto help you to find resources and people
p290
aVand we have discovered that the miracle
p291
aVof the intelligence of local people is such
p292
aVthat you can change the culture and the economy
p293
aVof this community just by capturing the passion,
p294
aVthe energy and imagination of your own people.
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you. (Applause)
