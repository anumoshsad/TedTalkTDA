VAs a scientist, and also as a human being,
p4
aVI've been trying to make myself
p5
aVsusceptible to wonder.
p6
aVI think Jason Webley last night called it
p7
aV"conspiring to be part of the magic."
p8
aVSo it's fortunate that my career as a biologist
p9
aVlets me dive deeply into the lives
p10
aVof some truly wondrous creatures
p11
aVthat share our planet:
p12
aVfireflies.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, for many of you, I know that fireflies
p15
aVmight conjure up some really great memories:
p16
aVchildhood, summertime,
p17
aVeven other TED Talks.
p18
aVMaybe something like this.
p19
aa(lp20
VMy seduction into the world of fireflies
p21
aVbegan when I was back in graduate school.
p22
aVOne evening, I was sitting out in my backyard
p23
aVin North Carolina,
p24
aVand suddenly, these silent sparks
p25
aVrose up all around me,
p26
aVand I began to wonder:
p27
aVHow do these creatures make light,
p28
aVand what's with all this flashing?
p29
aVAre they talking to one another?
p30
aVAnd what happens after the lights go out?
p31
aVI've been lucky enough to answer
p32
aVsome of these questions
p33
aVas I've explored this nocturnal world.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow if you've ever seen
p36
aVor even heard about fireflies,
p37
aVthen you'll know how magically they can transform
p38
aVour everyday landscape into something
p39
aVethereal and otherworldly,
p40
aVand this happens around the globe,
p41
aVlike this hillside in the Smoky Mountains
p42
aVthat I saw transformed into a living cascade of light
p43
aVby the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,
p44
aVor a roadside river that I visited in Japan
p45
aVas it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes
p46
aVof these Genji fireflies,
p47
aVor in Malaysia, the mangrove trees
p48
aVthat I watched blossom nightly
p49
aVnot with flowers
p50
aVbut with the lights of a thousand \u2014  (Bleep! Bleep!) \u2014 fireflies,
p51
aVall blinking together
p52
aVin stunning synchrony.
p53
aVThese luminous landscapes
p54
aVstill fill me with wonder,
p55
aVand they keep me connected to the magic
p56
aVof the natural world.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I find it amazing that they're created
p59
aVby these tiny insects.
p60
aVIn person, fireflies are charming.
p61
aVThey're charismatic.
p62
aVThey've been celebrated in art
p63
aVand in poetry for centuries.
p64
aVAs I've traveled around the world,
p65
aVI've met many thoughtful people
p66
aVwho have told me that God put fireflies on Earth
p67
aVfor humans to enjoy.
p68
aVOther creatures can enjoy them too.
p69
aVI think these graceful insects are truly miraculous
p70
aVbecause they so beautifully illuminate
p71
aVthe creative improvisation of evolution.
p72
aVThey've been shaped by two powerful
p73
aVevolutionary forces:
p74
aVnatural selection, the struggle for survival,
p75
aVand sexual selection,
p76
aVthe struggle for reproductive opportunity.
p77
aVAs a firefly junkie, the past 20 years
p78
aVhave been quite an exciting ride.
p79
aVTogether with my students at Tufts University
p80
aVand other colleagues,
p81
aVwe've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:
p82
aVtheir courtship and sex lives,
p83
aVtheir treachery and murder.
p84
aVSo today I'd like to share with you
p85
aVjust a couple of tales that we've brought back
p86
aVfrom our collective adventures
p87
aVinto this hidden world.
p88
aa(lp89
VFireflies belong to a very beautiful
p90
aVand diverse group of insects, the beetles.
p91
aVWorldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,
p92
aVand these have evolved remarkably diverse
p93
aVcourtship signals,
p94
aVthat is, different ways to find and attract mates.
p95
aVAround 150 million years ago,
p96
aVthe very first fireflies probably looked like this.
p97
aVThey flew during the daytime
p98
aVand they didn't light up.
p99
aVInstead, males used their fantastic antennae
p100
aVto sniff out perfumes given off by their females.
p101
aVIn other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.
p102
aVThey are attractively plump and wingless,
p103
aVso every night, they climb up onto perches
p104
aVand they glow brightly for hours
p105
aVto attract their flying but unlit males.
p106
aVIn still other fireflies, both sexes
p107
aVuse quick, bright flashes to find their mates.
p108
aVHere in North America,
p109
aVwe have more than 100 different kinds of firefly
p110
aVthat have the remarkable ability to shine energy
p111
aVout from their bodies
p112
aVin the form of light.
p113
aVHow do they do that?
p114
aVIt seems totally magical,
p115
aVbut these bioluminescent signals
p116
aVarise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions
p117
aVthat happen inside the firefly lantern.
p118
aVThe main star is an enzyme called luciferase,
p119
aVwhich in the course of evolution
p120
aVhas figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms
p121
aVaround an even smaller molecule called luciferin,
p122
aVin the process getting it so excited
p123
aVthat it actually gives off light.
p124
aVIncredible.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut how could these bright lights
p127
aVhave benefited some proto-firefly?
p128
aVTo answer this question, we need to flip back
p129
aVin the family album to some baby pictures.
p130
aVFireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow.
p131
aVThey spend the vast majority of their lifetime,
p132
aVup to two years,
p133
aVin this larval form.
p134
aVTheir main goal here, like my teenagers,
p135
aVis to eat and grow.
p136
aVAnd firefly light first originated
p137
aVin these juveniles.
p138
aVEvery single firefly larva can light up,
p139
aVeven when their adults can't.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut what's the point
p142
aVto being so conspicuous?
p143
aVWell, we know that these juveniles
p144
aVmake nasty-tasting chemicals
p145
aVthat help them survive their extended childhood,
p146
aVso we think these lights first evolved as a warning,
p147
aVa neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"
p148
aVto any would-be predators.
p149
aVIt took many millions of years
p150
aVbefore these bright lights
p151
aVevolved into a smart communication tool
p152
aVthat could be used not just to ward off potential predators
p153
aVbut to bring in potential mates.
p154
aVDriven now by sexual selection,
p155
aVsome adult fireflies
p156
aVlike this proud male
p157
aVevolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern
p158
aVthat would let them take courtship
p159
aVto a whole new level.
p160
aVThese adults only live a few weeks,
p161
aVand now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,
p162
aVthat is, on propelling their genes
p163
aVinto the next firefly generation.
p164
aVSo we can follow this male out into the field
p165
aVas he joins hundreds of other males
p166
aVwho are all showing off their new courtship signals.
p167
aVIt's amazing to think that the luminous displays
p168
aVwe admire
p169
aVhere and in fact everywhere around the world
p170
aVare actually the silent love songs
p171
aVof male fireflies.
p172
aVThey're flying and flashing their hearts out.
p173
aVI still find it very romantic.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut meanwhile, where are all the females?
p176
aVWell, they're lounging down below
p177
aVsurveying their options.
p178
aVThey have plenty of males to choose from,
p179
aVand these females turn out to be very picky.
p180
aVWhen a female sees a flash
p181
aVfrom an especially attractive male,
p182
aVshe'll aim her lantern in his direction,
p183
aVand give him a flash back.
p184
aVIt's her "come hither" sign.
p185
aVSo he flies closer and he flashes again.
p186
aVIf she still likes him,
p187
aVthey'll strike up a conversation.
p188
aVThese creatures speak their love
p189
aVin the language of light.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo what exactly do these females consider sexy?
p192
aVWe decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls
p193
aVto find out.
p194
aVWhen we tested females using blinking LED lights,
p195
aVwe discovered they prefer males
p196
aVwho give longer-lasting flashes.
p197
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p198
aVI know you're wondering,
p199
aVwhat gives these males their sex appeal?
p200
aVNow we get to see what happens
p201
aVwhen the lights go out.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe first thing we discovered
p204
aVis that once a male and female hook up like this,
p205
aVthey stay together all night long,
p206
aVand when we looked inside
p207
aVto see what might be happening,
p208
aVwe discovered a surprising new twist
p209
aVto firefly sex.
p210
aVWhile they're mating,
p211
aVthe male is busy giving the female
p212
aVnot just his sperm
p213
aVbut also a nutrient-filled package
p214
aVcalled a nuptial gift.
p215
aVWe can zoom in to look more closely
p216
aVinside this mating pair.
p217
aVWe can actually see the gift \u2014
p218
aVit's shown here in red \u2014
p219
aVas it's being passed from the male to the female.
p220
aVWhat makes this gift so valuable
p221
aVis that it's packed with protein
p222
aVthat the female will use to provision her eggs.
p223
aVSo females are keeping their eyes on this prize
p224
aVas they size up potential mates.
p225
aVWe discovered that females use male flash signals
p226
aVto try to predict which males
p227
aVhave the biggest gifts to offer,
p228
aVbecause this bling helps the female lay more eggs
p229
aVand ultimately launch more of her own offspring
p230
aVinto the next generation.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo it's not all sweetness and light.
p233
aVFirefly romance is risky.
p234
aVFor the most part, these adult fireflies
p235
aVdon't get eaten because like their juveniles
p236
aVthey can manufacture toxins that are repellent
p237
aVto birds and other insectivores,
p238
aVbut somewhere along the line,
p239
aVone particular group of fireflies
p240
aVsomehow lost the metabolic machinery
p241
aVneeded to make their own protective toxins.
p242
aVThis evolutionary flaw,
p243
aVwhich was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,
p244
aVhas driven these fireflies
p245
aVto take their bright lights out into the night
p246
aVwith treacherous intent.
p247
aVDubbed "femme fatales"
p248
aVby Jim Lloyd, another colleague,
p249
aVthese females have figured out how to target
p250
aVthe males of other firefly species.
p251
aVSo the hunt begins with the predator \u2014
p252
aVshe's shown here in the lower left \u2014
p253
aVwhere she's sitting quietly
p254
aVand eavesdropping on the courtship conversation
p255
aVof her intended prey,
p256
aVand here's how it might go.
p257
aVFirst the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"
p258
aVHis own female responds, "Maybe."
p259
aVSo then he flashes again.
p260
aVBut this time, the predator sneaks in a reply
p261
aVthat cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said.
p262
aVShe's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.
p263
aVIf she's good, she can lure this male close enough
p264
aVto reach out and grab him,
p265
aVand he's not just a light snack.
p266
aVOver the next hour, she slowly
p267
aVexsanguinates this male
p268
aVleaving behind just some gory remains.
p269
aVUnable to make their own toxins,
p270
aVthese females resort to drinking the blood
p271
aVof other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.
p272
aVSo a firefly vampire,
p273
aVbrought to you by natural selection.
p274
aa(lp275
VWe still have a lot to learn about fireflies,
p276
aVbut it looks like many stories will remain untold,
p277
aVbecause around the world, firefly populations
p278
aVare blinking out.
p279
aVThe main culprit: habitat loss.
p280
aVPretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,
p281
aVthe mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive,
p282
aVare giving way to development and to sprawl.
p283
aa(lp284
VHere's another problem: we've conquered darkness,
p285
aVbut in the process, we spill so much extra light out into the night
p286
aVthat it disrupts the lives of other creatures,
p287
aVand fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution
p288
aVbecause it obscures the signals
p289
aVthat they use to find their mates.
p290
aa(lp291
VDo we really need fireflies?
p292
aVAfter all, they're just one tiny bit
p293
aVof Earth's biodiversity.
p294
aVYet every time a species is lost,
p295
aVit's like extinguishing a room full of candles
p296
aVone by one.
p297
aVYou might not notice
p298
aVwhen the first few flames flicker out,
p299
aVbut in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.
p300
aVAs we work together to craft a planetary future,
p301
aVI hope we can find a way
p302
aVto keep these bright lights shining.
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
