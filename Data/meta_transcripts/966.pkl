VI got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.
p4
aVafter going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.
p5
aVI was awakened once during the night.
p6
aVMy heart rate was 61 beats per minute \u2014
p7
aVmy blood pressure, 127 over 74.
p8
aVI had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,
p9
aVso my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.
p10
aVI had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,
p11
aVzero of alcohol.
p12
aVAnd my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,
p13
aVor the NPI-16,
p14
aVis a reassuring 0.31.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe know that numbers are useful for us
p17
aVwhen we advertise, manage, govern, search.
p18
aVI'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,
p19
aVlearn, remember
p20
aVand want to improve.
p21
aVA few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I
p22
aVnoticed that people were subjecting themselves
p23
aVto regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking
p24
aVthat went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits
p25
aVsuch as stepping on a scale every day.
p26
aVPeople were tracking their food via Twitter,
p27
aVtheir kids' diapers on their iPhone.
p28
aVThey were making detailed journals
p29
aVof their spending, their mood,
p30
aVtheir symptoms, their treatments.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, we know some of the technological facts
p33
aVthat are driving this change in our lifestyle \u2014
p34
aVthe uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,
p35
aVthe exponential improvement in data storage
p36
aVand data processing,
p37
aVand the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
p38
aVThis little black dot there
p39
aVis a 3D accelerometer.
p40
aVIt tracks your movement through space.
p41
aVIt is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.
p42
aVThey're now down to well under a dollar a piece,
p43
aVand they're going into all kinds of devices.
p44
aVBut what's interesting
p45
aVis the incredible detailed information that you can get
p46
aVfrom just one sensor like this.
p47
aVThis kind of sensor
p48
aVis in the hit biometric device \u2014
p49
aVamong early adopters at the moment \u2014 the Fitbit.
p50
aVThis tracks your activity and also your sleep.
p51
aVIt has just that sensor in it.
p52
aa(lp53
VYou're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.
p54
aVI just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.
p55
aVIt's really just a pressure sensor
p56
aVlike the kind that's in a doorbell.
p57
aVAnd Nike knows how to get
p58
aVyour pace and distance from just that sensor.
p59
aVThis is the strap
p60
aVthat people use to transmit heart-rate data
p61
aVto their Nike+ system.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is a beautiful, new device
p64
aVthat gives you detailed sleep tracking data,
p65
aVnot just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep \u2014
p66
aVdeep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.
p67
aVThe sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
p68
aVThe rest of it is the bedside console;
p69
aVjust for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago \u2014
p70
aVI mean, really until now.
p71
aVAnd this is the sleep tracking system of today.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis just was presented
p74
aVat a health care conference in D.C.
p75
aVMost of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,
p76
aVbut the top is a very small GPS transceiver,
p77
aVwhich gives you the date and location
p78
aVof an asthma incident,
p79
aVgiving you a new awareness
p80
aVof your vulnerability
p81
aVin relation to time and environmental factors.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, we know that new tools
p84
aVare changing our sense of self in the world \u2014
p85
aVthese tiny sensors that gather data in nature,
p86
aVthe ubiquitous computing
p87
aVthat allows that data to be understood and used,
p88
aVand of course the social networks
p89
aVthat allow people to collaborate and contribute.
p90
aVBut we think of these tools as pointing outward,
p91
aVas windows
p92
aVand I'd just like to invite you to think of them
p93
aVas also turning inward
p94
aVand becoming mirrors.
p95
aVSo that when we think about using them
p96
aVto get some systematic improvement,
p97
aVwe also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,
p98
aVfor self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.
p99
aa(lp100
VHere's a biometric device:
p101
aVa pair of Apple Earbuds.
p102
aVLast year, Apple filed some patents
p103
aVto get blood oxygenation,
p104
aVheart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.
p105
aVWhat is this for?
p106
aVWhat should it be for?
p107
aVSome people will say it's for biometric security.
p108
aVSome people will say it's for public health research.
p109
aVSome people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
p110
aVI'd like to tell you
p111
aVthat it's also for self-knowledge.
p112
aVAnd the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
p113
aVThe self is just our operation center,
p114
aVour consciousness,
p115
aVour moral compass.
p116
aVSo, if we want to act
p117
aVmore effectively in the world,
p118
aVwe have to get to know ourselves better.
