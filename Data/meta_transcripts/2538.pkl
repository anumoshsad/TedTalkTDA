VAt Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour.
p4
aVWe visited not only with prosecutors
p5
aVbut with legislators,
p6
aVwith inmates in our state and local prisons.
p7
aVWe've gone to immigration detention centers.
p8
aVWe've met a lot of people.
p9
aVAnd we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen
p10
aVin our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers,
p11
aVgiving hope to those who want to create a better life
p12
aVafter serving their time.
p13
aa(lp14
VImagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline.
p15
aVWhat would it look like if we intervened,
p16
aVwith rehabilitation as a core value \u2014
p17
aVwith love and compassion as core values?
p18
aVWe would have a society that is safer,
p19
aVhealthier
p20
aVand worthy of raising our children in.
p21
aa(lp22
VI want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
p23
aVJames served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison
p24
aVand is being released in 18 months.
p25
aVNow James, like you and me,
p26
aVis more than the worst thing he's done.
p27
aVHe is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.
p28
aVHe committed a crime;
p29
aVhe's paying his debt,
p30
aVand working hard to build the skills
p31
aVto make the transition back to a productive life
p32
aVwhen he enters the civilian population again.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow James, like millions of people behind bars,
p35
aVis an example of what happens
p36
aVif we believe that our failings don't define who we are,
p37
aVthat we are all worthy of redemption
p38
aVand if we support those impacted by mass incarceration,
p39
aVwe can all heal together.
p40
aa(lp41
VI'd like to introduce you to James right now,
p42
aVand he's going to share his journey of redemption
p43
aVthrough spoken word.
p44
aa(lp45
VJames Cavitt: Thanks, John.
p46
aVTED, welcome to San Quentin.
p47
aVThe talent is abundant behind prison walls.
p48
aVFuture software engineers,
p49
aVentrepreneurs,
p50
aVcraftsmen,
p51
aVmusicians
p52
aVand artists.
p53
aVThis piece is inspired by all of the hard work
p54
aVthat men and women are doing on the inside
p55
aVto create better lives and futures for themselves
p56
aVafter they serve their time.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis piece is entitled, "Where I Live."
p59
aa(lp60
VI live in a world where most people are too afraid to go.
p61
aVSurrounded by tall, concrete walls,
p62
aVsteel bars,
p63
aVwhere razor wire have a way
p64
aVof cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.
p65
aa(lp66
VI live in a world
p67
aVthat kill people who kill people
p68
aVin order to teach people
p69
aVthat killing people is wrong.
p70
aVImagine that.
p71
aa(lp72
VBetter yet,
p73
aVimagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal
p74
aVand become strong.
p75
aVMaybe then we would all be singin' "Redemption Song."
p76
aa(lp77
VI live in a world that has been called "hell on Earth"
p78
aVby those trapped inside.
p79
aVBut I've come to the stark realization
p80
aVthat prison \u2014
p81
aVit really is what you make it.
p82
aVYou see, in spite of the harshness of my reality,
p83
aVthere is a silver lining.
p84
aVI knew that my freedom was gonna come,
p85
aVit was just a matter of time.
p86
aVAnd so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile,
p87
aVand I realized that you don't have to be free
p88
aVin order to experience freedom.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd just because you're free,
p91
aVdoesn't mean that you have freedom.
p92
aVMany of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons.
p93
aVWe walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin':
p94
aVfreedom!
p95
aa(lp96
VDon't you get it?
p97
aVWe're all serving time;
p98
aVwe're just in different places.
p99
aVAs for me,
p100
aVI choose to be free from the prisons I've created.
p101
aVThe key:
p102
aVforgiveness.
p103
aVAction's my witness.
p104
aVIf we want freedom,
p105
aVthen we gotta think different.
p106
aVBecause freedom ...
p107
aVit isn't a place.
p108
aVIt's a mind setting.
p109

p118
aVMinutes after they took I
p119
aVfrom the bottomless pit.
p120
aa(lp121
VMy hands were made strong
p122
aVby the hand of the almighty.
p123
