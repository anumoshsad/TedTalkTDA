VI have been teaching for a long time,
p4
aVand in doing so
p5
aVhave acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
p6
aVthat I really wish more people would understand
p7
aVabout the potential of students.
p8
aVIn 1931, my grandmother \u2014
p9
aVbottom left for you guys over here \u2014
p10
aVgraduated from the eighth grade.
p11
aVShe went to school to get the information
p12
aVbecause that's where the information lived.
p13
aVIt was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
p14
aVand she needed to go there to get the information,
p15
aVbecause that's how you learned.
p16
aVFast-forward a generation:
p17
aVthis is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,
p18
aVwhere my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
p19
aVAnd he again had to travel to the school
p20
aVto get the information from the teacher,
p21
aVstored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
p22
aVand take it with him,
p23
aVbecause that is how information was being transported
p24
aVfrom teacher to student and then used in the world.
p25
aVWhen I was a kid,
p26
aVwe had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
p27
aVIt was purchased the year I was born,
p28
aVand it was extraordinary,
p29
aVbecause I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
p30
aVThe information was inside my house
p31
aVand it was awesome.
p32
aVThis was different
p33
aVthan either generation had experienced before,
p34
aVand it changed the way I interacted with information
p35
aVeven at just a small level.
p36
aVBut the information was closer to me.
p37
aVI could get access to it.
p38
aa(lp39
VIn the time that passes
p40
aVbetween when I was a kid in high school
p41
aVand when I started teaching,
p42
aVwe really see the advent of the Internet.
p43
aVRight about the time that the Internet gets going
p44
aVas an educational tool,
p45
aVI take off from Wisconsin
p46
aVand move to Kansas, small town Kansas,
p47
aVwhere I had an opportunity to teach
p48
aVin a lovely, small-town,
p49
aVrural Kansas school district,
p50
aVwhere I was teaching my favorite subject,
p51
aVAmerican government.
p52
aVMy first year \u2014 super gung-ho \u2014 going to teach American government,
p53
aVloved the political system.
p54
aVKids in the 12th grade:
p55
aVnot exactly all that enthusiastic
p56
aVabout the American government system.
p57
aVYear two: learned a few things \u2014 had to change my tactic.
p58
aVAnd I put in front of them an authentic experience
p59
aVthat allowed them to learn for themselves.
p60
aVI didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
p61
aVI posed a problem in front of them,
p62
aVwhich was to put on an election forum for their own community.
p63
aa(lp64
VThey produced flyers. They called offices.
p65
aVThey checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
p66
aVThey produced an election forum booklet
p67
aVfor the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
p68
aVThey invited everyone into the school
p69
aVfor an evening of conversation
p70
aVabout government and politics
p71
aVand whether or not the streets were done well,
p72
aVand really had this robust experiential learning.
p73
aVThe older teachers \u2014 more experienced \u2014
p74
aVlooked at me and went,
p75
aV"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aV"She doesn't know what she's in for."
p78
aVBut I knew that the kids would show up,
p79
aVand I believed it,
p80
aVand I told them every week what I expected out of them.
p81
aVAnd that night, all 90 kids \u2014
p82
aVdressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
p83
aVI had to just sit and watch.
p84
aVIt was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
p85
aVIt meant something to them.
p86
aVAnd they will step up.
p87
aa(lp88
VFrom Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,
p89
aVwhere I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
p90
aVthis time with middle school students.
p91
aVLuckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
p92
aVCould teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
p93
aVAgain, "thrilled" to learn.
p94
aVBut what was interesting
p95
aVabout this position I found myself in in Arizona,
p96
aVwas I had this really
p97
aVextraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with
p98
aVin a truly public school,
p99
aVand we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
p100
aVAnd one opportunity
p101
aVwas we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,
p102
aVwhich is the gentleman
p103
aVthat the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
p104
aVAnd he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
p105
aVWe could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
p106
aVThere was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe problem then becomes
p109
aVhow do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
p110
aVand deal with the subject in a way
p111
aVthat is responsible and respectful,
p112
aVand they know what to do with it.
p113
aVAnd so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
p114
aVas an example of a gentleman
p115
aVwho singularly used his life to do something positive.
p116
aVI then challenged the kids to identify
p117
aVsomeone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
p118
aVthat they could identify that had done a similar thing.
p119
aVI asked them to produce a little movie about it.
p120
aVIt's the first time we'd done this.
p121
aVNobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
p122
aVbut they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
p123
aVIt was the most awesome moment of revelation
p124
aVthat when you ask kids to use their own voice
p125
aVand ask them to speak for themselves,
p126
aVwhat they're willing to share.
p127
aVThe last question of the assignment is:
p128
aVhow do you plan to use your life
p129
aVto positively impact other people?
p130
aVThe things that kids will say
p131
aVwhen you ask them and take the time to listen
p132
aVis extraordinary.
p133
aa(lp134
VFast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
p135
aVI teach at the Science Leadership Academy,
p136
aVwhich is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
p137
aVand the school district of Philadelphia.
p138
aVWe are a nine through 12 public school,
p139
aVbut we do school quite differently.
p140
aVI moved there primarily
p141
aVto be part of a learning environment
p142
aVthat validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
p143
aVand that really wanted to investigate
p144
aVwhat was possible
p145
aVwhen you are willing to let go
p146
aVof some of the paradigms of the past,
p147
aVof information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
p148
aVand when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
p149
aVand to a moment when we have information surplus.
p150
aVSo what do you do when the information is all around you?
p151
aVWhy do you have kids come to school
p152
aVif they no longer have to come there to get the information?
p153
aa(lp154
VIn Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,
p155
aVso the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
p156
aVtaking them home, getting access to information.
p157
aVAnd here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
p158
aVwhen you've given the tool
p159
aVto acquire information to students,
p160
aVis that you have to be comfortable with this idea
p161
aVof allowing kids to fail
p162
aVas part of the learning process.
p163
aVWe deal right now in the educational landscape
p164
aVwith an infatuation
p165
aVwith the culture of one right answer
p166
aVthat can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
p167
aVand I am here to share with you:
p168
aVit is not learning.
p169
aVThat is the absolute wrong thing to ask,
p170
aVto tell kids to never be wrong.
p171
aVTo ask them to always have the right answer
p172
aVdoesn't allow them to learn.
p173
aVSo we did this project,
p174
aVand this is one of the artifacts of the project.
p175
aVI almost never show them off
p176
aVbecause of the issue of the idea of failure.
p177
aa(lp178
VMy students produced these info-graphics
p179
aVas a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
p180
aVresponding to the oil spill.
p181
aVI asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
p182
aVof the info-graphics that existed
p183
aVin a lot of mass media,
p184
aVand take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
p185
aVand produce one for themselves
p186
aVof a different man-made disaster from American history.
p187
aVAnd they had certain criteria to do it.
p188
aVThey were a little uncomfortable with it,
p189
aVbecause we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
p190
aVThey can talk \u2014 they're very smooth,
p191
aVand they can write very, very well,
p192
aVbut asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
p193
aVwas a little uncomfortable for them.
p194
aVBut I gave them the room to just do the thing.
p195
aVGo create. Go figure it out.
p196
aVLet's see what we can do.
p197
aVAnd the student that persistently
p198
aVturns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
p199
aVThis was done in like two or three days.
p200
aVAnd this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
p203
aVAnd they immediately went, "There it is."
p204
aVDidn't read anything. "There it is."
p205
aVAnd I said, "Well what makes it great?"
p206
aVAnd they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
p207
aVAnd there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
p208
aVAnd I said, "Go read it."
p209
aVAnd they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
p210
aVAnd then we went to another one \u2014
p211
aVit didn't have great visuals, but it had great information \u2014
p212
aVand spent an hour talking about the learning process,
p213
aVbecause it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
p214
aVor whether or not it was what I could create.
p215
aVIt asked them to create for themselves,
p216
aVand it allowed them to fail,
p217
aVprocess, learn from.
p218
aVAnd when we do another round of this in my class this year,
p219
aVthey will do better this time,
p220
aVbecause learning
p221
aVhas to include an amount of failure,
p222
aVbecause failure is instructional
p223
aVin the process.
p224
aa(lp225
VThere are a million pictures
p226
aVthat I could click through here,
p227
aVand had to choose carefully \u2014 this is one of my favorites \u2014
p228
aVof students learning,
p229
aVof what learning can look like
p230
aVin a landscape where we let go of the idea
p231
aVthat kids have to come to school to get the information,
p232
aVbut instead, ask them what they can do with it.
p233
aVAsk them really interesting questions.
p234
aVThey will not disappoint.
p235
aVAsk them to go to places,
p236
aVto see things for themselves,
p237
aVto actually experience the learning,
p238
aVto play, to inquire.
p239
aVThis is one of my favorite photos,
p240
aVbecause this was taken on Tuesday,
p241
aVwhen I asked the students to go to the polls.
p242
aVThis is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
p243
aVand he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
p244
aVBut this is learning too,
p245
aVbecause we asked them to go out into real spaces.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe main point
p248
aVis that, if we continue to look at education
p249
aVas if it's about coming to school
p250
aVto get the information
p251
aVand not about experiential learning,
p252
aVempowering student voice and embracing failure,
p253
aVwe're missing the mark.
p254
aVAnd everything that everybody is talking about today
p255
aVisn't possible if we keep having an educational system
p256
aVthat does not value these qualities,
p257
aVbecause we won't get there with a standardized test,
p258
aVand we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
p259
aVWe know how to do this better,
p260
aVand it's time to do better.
