VMany believe driving is an activity
p4
aVsolely reserved for those who can see.
p5
aVA blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently
p6
aVwas thought to be an impossible task, until now.
p7
aVHello, my name is Dennis Hong,
p8
aVand we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind
p9
aVby building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo before I talk about this car for the blind,
p12
aVlet me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on
p13
aVcalled the DARPA Urban Challenge.
p14
aVNow this was about building a robotic car
p15
aVthat can drive itself.
p16
aVYou press start, nobody touches anything,
p17
aVand it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
p18
aVSo in 2007, our team won half a million dollars
p19
aVby placing third place in this competition.
p20
aVSo about that time,
p21
aVthe National Federation of the Blind, or NFB,
p22
aVchallenged the research committee
p23
aVabout who can develop a car
p24
aVthat lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
p25
aVWe decided to give it a try,
p26
aVbecause we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
p27
aVWe have already an autonomous vehicle.
p28
aVWe just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVWe couldn't have been more wrong.
p31
aVWhat NFB wanted
p32
aVwas not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around,
p33
aVbut a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
p34
aVSo we had to throw everything out the window
p35
aVand start from scratch.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo to test this crazy idea,
p38
aVwe developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle
p39
aVto test the feasibility.
p40
aVAnd in the summer of 2009,
p41
aVwe invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country
p42
aVand gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
p43
aVIt was an absolutely amazing experience.
p44
aVBut the problem with this car was
p45
aVit was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment,
p46
aVin a flat, closed-off parking lot \u2014
p47
aVeven the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo with this success,
p50
aVwe decided to take the next big step,
p51
aVto develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
p52
aVSo how does it work?
p53
aVWell, it's a rather complex system,
p54
aVbut let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
p55
aVSo we have three steps.
p56
aVWe have perception, computation
p57
aVand non-visual interfaces.
p58
aVNow obviously the driver cannot see,
p59
aVso the system needs to perceive the environment
p60
aVand gather information for the driver.
p61
aVFor that, we use an initial measurement unit.
p62
aVSo it measures acceleration, angular acceleration \u2014
p63
aVlike a human ear, inner ear.
p64
aVWe fuse that information with a GPS unit
p65
aVto get an estimate of the location of the car.
p66
aVWe also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
p67
aVAnd we also use three laser range finders.
p68
aVThe lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles \u2014
p69
aVa car approaching from the front, the back
p70
aVand also any obstacles that run into the roads,
p71
aVany obstacles around the vehicle.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer,
p74
aVand the computer can do two things.
p75
aVOne is, first of all, process this information
p76
aVto have an understanding of the environment \u2014
p77
aVthese are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles \u2014
p78
aVand convey this information to the driver.
p79
aVThe system is also smart enough
p80
aVto figure out the safest way to operate the car.
p81
aVSo we can also generate instructions
p82
aVon how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
p83
aVBut the problem is this: How do we convey
p84
aVthis information and instructions
p85
aVto a person who cannot see
p86
aVfast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
p87
aVSo for this, we developed many different types
p88
aVof non-visual user interface technology.
p89
aVSo starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system,
p90
aVa vibrating vest,
p91
aVa click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip,
p92
aVeven a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
p93
aVBut today we're going to talk about
p94
aVthree of these non-visual user interfaces.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
p97
aVSo these are a pair of gloves,
p98
aVand it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part
p99
aVso you can convey instructions about how to steer \u2014
p100
aVthe direction and the intensity.
p101
aVAnother device is called SpeedStrip.
p102
aVSo this is a chair \u2014 as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
p103
aVWe gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns,
p104
aVand we actuate them to convey information about the speed,
p105
aVand also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
p106
aVSo over here, you can see
p107
aVhow the computer understands the environment,
p108
aVand because you cannot see the vibration,
p109
aVwe actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
p110
aVThis is the sensory data,
p111
aVand that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip,
p114
aVare very effective.
p115
aVBut the problem is
p116
aVthese are instructional cue devices.
p117
aVSo this is not really freedom, right?
p118
aVThe computer tells you how to drive \u2014
p119
aVturn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
p120
aVWe call this the "backseat-driver problem."
p121
aVSo we're moving away from the instructional cue devices,
p122
aVand we're now focusing more
p123
aVon the informational devices.
p124
aVA good example for this informational non-visual user interface
p125
aVis called AirPix.
p126
aVSo think of it as a monitor for the blind.
p127
aVSo it's a small tablet, has many holes in it,
p128
aVand compressed air comes out,
p129
aVso it can actually draw images.
p130
aVSo even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it,
p131
aVyou can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
p132
aVActually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out
p133
aVand possibly the temperature.
p134
aVSo it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
p135
aVSo here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle
p136
aVand how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
p137
aVFor this, we're showing a simulator,
p138
aVa blind person driving using the AirPix.
p139
aVThis simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers
p140
aVand also quickly testing different types of ideas
p141
aVfor different types of non-visual user interfaces.
p142
aVSo basically that's how it works.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo just a month ago,
p145
aVon January 29th,
p146
aVwe unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public
p147
aVat the world-famous Daytona International Speedway
p148
aVduring the Rolex 24 racing event.
p149
aVWe also had some surprises. Let's take a look.
p150

aa(lp153
V(Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January.
p154
aVHe's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Cheering)
p157
aa(lp158
V(Honking)
p159
aa(lp160
VThere's the grandstand now.
p161
aVAnd he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.
p162
aVWell there comes the first box.
p163
aVNow let's see if Mark avoids it.
p164
aVHe does. He passes it on the right.
p165
aVThird box is out. The fourth box is out.
p166
aVAnd he's perfectly making his way between the two.
p167
aVHe's closing in on the van
p168
aVto make the moving pass.
p169
aVWell this is what it's all about,
p170
aVthis kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity.
p171
aVHe's approaching the end of the run,
p172
aVmakes his way between the barrels that are set up there.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Honking)
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VDennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.
p179
aVMark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel.
p180
aa(lp181
VMark Riccobono: Yes.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VDH: So since we started this project,
p186
aVwe've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls
p187
aVfrom people from all around the world.
p188
aVLetters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one:
p189
aV"Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine."
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVBut sometimes \u2014
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVBut sometimes I also do get \u2014
p194
aVI wouldn't call it hate mail \u2014
p195
aVbut letters of really strong concern:
p196
aV"Dr. Hong, are you insane,
p197
aVtrying to put blind people on the road?
p198
aVYou must be out of your mind."
p199
aVBut this vehicle is a prototype vehicle,
p200
aVand it's not going to be on the road
p201
aVuntil it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
p202
aVAnd I truly believe that this can happen.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut still, will the society,
p205
aVwould they accept such a radical idea?
p206
aVHow are we going to handle insurance?
p207
aVHow are we going to issue driver's licenses?
p208
aVThere's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges
p209
aVthat we need to address before this becomes a reality.
p210
aVOf course, the main goal of this project
p211
aVis to develop a car for the blind.
p212
aVBut potentially more important than this
p213
aVis the tremendous value of the spin-off technology
p214
aVthat can come from this project.
p215
aVThe sensors that are used can see through the dark,
p216
aVthe fog and rain.
p217
aVAnd together with this new type of interfaces,
p218
aVwe can use these technologies
p219
aVand apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
p220
aVOr for the blind, everyday home appliances \u2014
p221
aVin the educational setting, in the office setting.
p222
aVJust imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard
p223
aVand a blind student can see what's written and read
p224
aVusing these non-visual interfaces.
p225
aVThis is priceless.
p226
aVSo today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you very much.
