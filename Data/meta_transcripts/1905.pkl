VIt's a pleasure to be here
p4
aVin Edinburgh, Scotland,
p5
aVthe birthplace of the needle and syringe.
p6
aVLess than a mile from here in this direction,
p7
aVin 1853 a Scotsman
p8
aVfiled his very first patent on the needle and syringe.
p9
aVHis name was Alexander Wood,
p10
aVand it was at the Royal College of Physicians.
p11
aVThis is the patent.
p12
aVWhat blows my mind when I look at it even today
p13
aVis that it looks almost identical
p14
aVto the needle in use today.
p15
aVYet, it's 160 years old.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo we turn to the field of vaccines.
p18
aVMost vaccines are delivered with
p19
aVthe needle and syringe,  this 160-year-old technology.
p20
aVAnd credit where it's due \u2014 on many levels,
p21
aVvaccines are a successful technology.
p22
aVAfter clean water and sanitation,
p23
aVvaccines are the one technology that has increased
p24
aVour life span the most.
p25
aVThat's a pretty hard act to beat.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut just like any other technology,
p28
aVvaccines have their shortcomings,
p29
aVand the needle and syringe
p30
aVis a key part within that narrative \u2014
p31
aVthis old technology.
p32
aVSo let's start with the obvious:
p33
aVMany of us don't like the needle and syringe.
p34
aVI share that view.
p35
aVHowever, 20 percent of the population
p36
aVhave a thing called needle phobia.
p37
aVThat's more than disliking the needle;
p38
aVthat is actively avoiding being vaccinated
p39
aVbecause of needle phobia.
p40
aVAnd that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, related to this is another key issue,
p43
aVwhich is needlestick injuries.
p44
aVAnd the WHO has figures
p45
aVthat suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year
p46
aVtake place due to cross-contamination
p47
aVwith needlestick injuries.
p48
aVThese are early deaths that take place.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, these are two things that  you probably may have heard of,
p51
aVbut there are two other shortcomings
p52
aVof the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about.
p53
aVOne is it could be holding back
p54
aVthe next generation of vaccines
p55
aVin terms of their immune responses.
p56
aVAnd the second is that it could be responsible
p57
aVfor the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well.
p58
aa(lp59
VI'm going to tell you about some work
p60
aVthat my team and I are doing in Australia
p61
aVat the University of Queensland
p62
aVon a technology designed to  tackle those four problems.
p63
aVAnd that technology is called the Nanopatch.
p64
aVNow, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.
p65
aVTo the naked eye
p66
aVit just looks like a square
p67
aVsmaller than a postage stamp,
p68
aVbut under a microscope
p69
aVwhat you see are thousands of tiny projections
p70
aVthat are invisible to the human eye.
p71
aVAnd there's about 4,000 projections
p72
aVon this particular square compared to the needle.
p73
aVAnd I've designed those projections
p74
aVto serve a key role, which is to  work with the skin's immune system.
p75
aVSo that's a very important function
p76
aVtied in with the Nanopatch.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow we make the Nanopatch
p79
aVwith a technique
p80
aVcalled deep reactive ion etching.
p81
aVAnd this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed
p82
aVfrom the semiconductor industry,
p83
aVand therefore is low cost
p84
aVand can be rolled out in large numbers.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow we dry-coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch
p87
aVand apply it to the skin.
p88
aVNow, the simplest form of application
p89
aVis using our finger,
p90
aVbut our finger has some limitations,
p91
aVso we've devised an applicator.
p92
aVAnd it's a very simple device \u2014
p93
aVyou could call it a sophisticated finger.
p94
aVIt's a spring-operated device.
p95
aVWhat we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so \u2014
p96
aV(Click) \u2014
p97
aVimmediately a few things happen.
p98
aVSo firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch
p99
aVbreach through the tough outer layer
p100
aVand the vaccine is very quickly released \u2014
p101
aVwithin less than a minute, in fact.
p102
aVThen we can take the Nanopatch off
p103
aVand discard it.
p104
aVAnd indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,
p107
aVand immediately you can see some key advantages.
p108
aVWe've talked about it being needle-free \u2014
p109
aVthese are projections that you can't even see \u2014
p110
aVand, of course, we get around
p111
aVthe needle phobia issue as well.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, if we take a step back and think about
p114
aVthese other two really important advantages:
p115
aVOne is improved immune  responses through delivery,
p116
aVand the second is getting rid of the cold chain.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo let's start with the first one,  this immunogenicity idea.
p119
aVIt takes a little while to get our heads around,
p120
aVbut I'll try to explain it in simple terms.
p121
aVSo I'll take a step back and explain to you
p122
aVhow vaccines work in a simple way.
p123
aVSo vaccines work by introducing into our body
p124
aVa thing called an antigen
p125
aVwhich is a safe form of a germ.
p126
aVNow that safe germ, that antigen,
p127
aVtricks our body into mounting an immune response,
p128
aVlearning and remembering  how to deal with intruders.
p129
aVWhen the real intruder comes along
p130
aVthe body quickly mounts an immune response
p131
aVto deal with that vaccine
p132
aVand neutralizes the infection.
p133
aVSo it does that well.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe,
p136
aVmost vaccines are delivered that way \u2014
p137
aVwith this old technology and the needle.
p138
aVBut it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses;
p139
aVit's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.
p140
aVTo describe this idea,
p141
aVwe need to take a journey through the skin,
p142
aVstarting with one of those projections
p143
aVand applying the Nanopatch to the skin.
p144
aVAnd we see this kind of data.
p145
aVNow, this is real data \u2014
p146
aVthat thing that we can see there is one projection
p147
aVfrom the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin
p148
aVand those colors are different layers.
p149
aVNow, to give you an idea of scale,
p150
aVif the needle was shown here, it would be too big.
p151
aVIt would be 10 times bigger
p152
aVthan the size of that screen, going 10 times deeper as well.
p153
aVIt's off the grid entirely.
p154
aVYou can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin.
p155
aVThat red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,
p156
aVbut the brown layer and the magenta layer
p157
aVare jammed full of immune cells.
p158
aVAs one example, in the brown layer
p159
aVthere's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell \u2014
p160
aVevery square millimeter of our body
p161
aVis jammed full of those Langerhans cells,
p162
aVthose immune cells, and  there's others shown as well
p163
aVthat we haven't stained in this image.
p164
aVBut you can immediately see that the Nanopatch
p165
aVachieves that penetration indeed.
p166
aVWe target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells
p167
aVjust residing within a hair's width
p168
aVof the surface of the skin.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that,
p171
aVI found that exciting. But so what?
p172
aVSo what if you've targeted cells?
p173
aVIn the world of vaccines, what does that mean?
p174
aVThe world of vaccines is getting better.
p175
aVIt's getting more systematic.
p176
aVHowever, you still don't really know
p177
aVif a vaccine is going to work
p178
aVuntil you roll your sleeves up
p179
aVand vaccinate and wait.
p180
aVIt's a gambler's game even today.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, we had to do that gamble.
p183
aVWe obtained an influenza vaccine,
p184
aVwe applied it to our Nanopatches
p185
aVand we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,
p186
aVand we waited \u2014
p187
aVand this is in the live animal.
p188
aVWe waited a month,
p189
aVand this is what we found out.
p190
aVThis is a data slide showing the immune responses
p191
aVthat we've generated with a Nanopatch
p192
aVcompared to the needle and syringe into muscle.
p193
aVSo on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms.
p194
aVOn the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated,
p195
aVand that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold.
p196
aVIf we're above that line it's considered protective;
p197
aVif we're below that line it's not.
p198
aVSo the red line is mostly below that curve
p199
aVand indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective,
p200
aVand that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.
p201
aVBut notice immediately the distinctly different curve
p202
aVthat we achieve with the blue line.
p203
aVThat's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;
p204
aVthe delivered dose of the Nanopatch is
p205
aVa completely different immunogenicity curve.
p206
aVThat's a real fresh opportunity.
p207
aVSuddenly we have a brand new lever
p208
aVin the world of vaccines.
p209
aVWe can push it one way,
p210
aVwhere we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive
p211
aVand can get protection
p212
aVwith a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle.
p213
aVThat can take a vaccine that's suddenly  10 dollars down to 10 cents,
p214
aVand that's particularly important  within the developing world.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut there's another angle to this as well \u2014
p217
aVyou can take vaccines that currently don't work
p218
aVand get them over that line
p219
aVand get them protective.
p220
aVAnd certainly in the world of vaccines
p221
aVthat can be important.
p222
aVLet's consider the big three:
p223
aVHIV, malaria, tuberculosis.
p224
aVThey're responsible for about  7 million deaths per year,
p225
aVand there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those.
p226
aVSo potentially, with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch,
p227
aVwe can help make that happen.
p228
aVWe can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line.
p229
aVNow, of course, we've worked within my lab
p230
aVwith many other vaccines that have attained
p231
aVsimilar responses and similar curves to this,
p232
aVwhat we've achieved with influenza.
p233
aa(lp234
VI'd like to now switch to talk about
p235
aVanother key shortcoming of today's vaccines,
p236
aVand that is the need to maintain the cold chain.
p237
aVAs the name suggests \u2014 the cold chain \u2014
p238
aVit's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production
p239
aVall the way through to when the vaccine is applied,
p240
aVto keep it refrigerated.
p241
aVNow, that presents some logistical challenges
p242
aVbut we have ways to do it.
p243
aVThis is a slightly extreme case in point
p244
aVbut it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,
p245
aVin particular in resource-poor settings,
p246
aVof what's required to get vaccines
p247
aVrefrigerated and maintain the cold chain.
p248
aVIf the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,
p249
aVbut interestingly it can be too cold
p250
aVand the vaccine can break down as well.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow, the stakes are very high.
p253
aVThe WHO estimates that within Africa,
p254
aVup to half the vaccines used there
p255
aVare considered to not be working properly
p256
aVbecause at some point the  cold chain has fallen over.
p257
aVSo it's a big problem, and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe
p258
aVbecause it's a liquid form vaccine, and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.
p259
aa(lp260
VA key attribute of our Nanopatch
p261
aVis that the vaccine is dry,
p262
aVand when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.
p263
aVWithin my lab we've shown that we can keep
p264
aVthe vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius
p265
aVfor more than a year without  any loss in activity at all.
p266
aVThat's an important improvement.
p267
aV(Applause)
p268
aVWe're delighted about it as well.
p269
aVAnd the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven
p270
aVthe Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.
p271
aVAnd as a scientist, I love that and I love science.
p272
aVHowever, as an engineer,
p273
aVas a biomedical engineer
p274
aVand also as a human being,
p275
aVI'm not going to be satisfied
p276
aVuntil we've rolled this thing  out, taken it out of the lab
p277
aVand got it to people in large numbers
p278
aVand particularly the people that need it the most.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo we've commenced this particular journey,
p281
aVand we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way.
p282
aVWe've started with Papua New Guinea.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country.
p285
aVIt's about the same size as France,
p286
aVbut it suffers from many of the key barriers
p287
aVexisting within the world of today's vaccines.
p288
aVThere's the logistics:
p289
aVWithin this country there are only 800  refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.
p290
aVMany of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby, many of them are breaking down
p291
aVand many are not in the Highlands  where they are required.
p292
aVThat's a challenge.
p293
aVBut also, Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV,
p294
aVhuman papillomavirus, the  cervical cancer [risk factor].
p295
aVYet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers
p296
aVbecause it's too expensive.
p297
aVSo for those two reasons, with  the attributes of the Nanopatch,
p298
aVwe've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch,
p299
aVand taken it to Papua New Guinea
p300
aVand we'll be following that up shortly.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, doing this kind of work is not easy.
p303
aVIt's challenging,
p304
aVbut there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing.
p305
aVAnd as we look ahead
p306
aVI'd like to share with you a thought:
p307
aVIt's the thought of a future where
p308
aVthe 17 million deaths per year
p309
aVthat we currently have due to infectious disease
p310
aVis a historical footnote.
p311
aVAnd it's a historical footnote that has been achieved
p312
aVby improved, radically improved vaccines.
p313
aVNow standing here today in front of you
p314
aVat the birthplace of the needle and syringe,
p315
aVa device that's 160 years old,
p316
aVI'm presenting to you an alternative approach
p317
aVthat could really help make that happen \u2014
p318
aVand it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle-free, pain-free,
p319
aVthe ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity.
p320
aVThank you.
