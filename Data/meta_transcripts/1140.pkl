VIt's great being here at TED.
p4
aVYou know, I think there might be some presentations
p5
aVthat will go over my head,
p6
aVbut the most amazing concepts
p7
aVare the ones that go right under my feet.
p8
aVThe little things in life,
p9
aVsometimes that we forget about,
p10
aVlike pollination, that we take for granted.
p11
aVAnd you can't tell the story about pollinators \u2014
p12
aVbees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies \u2014
p13
aVwithout telling the story about the invention of flowers
p14
aVand how they co-evolved
p15
aVover 50 million years.
p16
aa(lp17
VI've been filming time-lapse flowers
p18
aV24 hours a day, seven days a week,
p19
aVfor over 35 years.
p20
aVTo watch them move
p21
aVis a dance I'm never going to get tired of.
p22
aVIt fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.
p23
aVBeauty and seduction, I believe,
p24
aVis nature's tool for survival,
p25
aVbecause we will protect what we fall in love with.
p26
aVTheir relationship
p27
aVis a love story that feeds the Earth.
p28
aVIt reminds us that we are a part of nature,
p29
aVand we're not separate from it.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder,
p32
aVit motivated me to take action.
p33
aVWe depend on pollinators
p34
aVfor over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.
p35
aVAnd many scientists believe
p36
aVit's the most serious issue facing mankind.
p37
aVIt's like the canary in the coalmine.
p38
aVIf they disappear, so do we.
p39
aVIt reminds us that we are a part of nature
p40
aVand we need to take care of it.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhat motivated me to film their behavior
p43
aVwas something that I asked my scientific advisers:
p44
aV"What motivates the pollinators?"
p45
aVWell, their answer was,
p46
aV"It's all about risk and reward."
p47
aVLike a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"
p48
aVAnd they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."
p49
aVI go, "Why?"
p50
aV"Well, in order to reproduce."
p51
aV"Well, why?"
p52
aVAnd I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."
p53
aVAnd Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert,
p54
aVhe replied, "Nothing lasts forever.
p55
aVEverything in the universe wears out."
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd that blew my mind.
p58
aVBecause I realized
p59
aVthat nature had invented reproduction
p60
aVas a mechanism for life to move forward,
p61
aVas a life force that passes right through us
p62
aVand makes us a link in the evolution of life.
p63
aVRarely seen by the naked eye,
p64
aVthis intersection
p65
aVbetween the animal world and the plant world
p66
aVis truly a magic moment.
p67
aVIt's the mystical moment
p68
aVwhere life regenerates itself,
p69
aVover and over again.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo here is some nectar from my film.
p72
aVI hope you'll drink, tweet
p73
aVand plant some seeds
p74
aVto pollinate a friendly garden.
p75
aVAnd always take time to smell the flowers,
p76
aVand let it fill you with beauty,
p77
aVand rediscover that sense of wonder.
p78
aVHere are some images from the film.
