VSo, this book that I have in my hand
p4
aVis a directory of everybody who had an email address
p5
aVin 1982. (Laughter)
p6
aVActually, it's deceptively large.
p7
aVThere's actually only about 20 people on each page,
p8
aVbecause we have the name, address
p9
aVand telephone number of every single person.
p10
aVAnd, in fact, everybody's listed twice,
p11
aVbecause it's sorted once by name and once by email address.
p12
aVObviously a very small community.
p13
aVThere were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
p14
aVI knew them both.
p15
aVWe didn't all know each other,
p16
aVbut we all kind of trusted each other,
p17
aVand that basic feeling of trust
p18
aVpermeated the whole network,
p19
aVand there was a real sense that
p20
aVwe could depend on each other to do things.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,
p23
aVlet me tell you what it was like
p24
aVto register a domain name in the early days.
p25
aVNow, it just so happened that I got to register
p26
aVthe third domain name on the Internet.
p27
aVSo I could have anything I wanted
p28
aVother than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
p29
aVSo I picked think.com, but then I thought,
p30
aVyou know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.
p31
aVMaybe I should register a few extras just in case.
p32
aVAnd then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VThat attitude of only taking what you need
p37
aVwas really what everybody had on the network in those days,
p38
aVand in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,
p39
aVbut it was actually kind of built into the protocols
p40
aVof the Internet itself.
p41
aVSo the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,
p42
aVand the way that the \u2014 the routing algorithm that used it,
p43
aVwere fundamentally "from each according to their ability,
p44
aVto each according to their need."
p45
aVAnd so, if you had some extra bandwidth,
p46
aVyou'd deliver a message for someone.
p47
aVIf they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.
p48
aVYou'd kind of depend on people to do that,
p49
aVand that was the building block.
p50
aVIt was actually interesting that such a communist principle
p51
aVwas the basis of a system developed during the Cold War
p52
aVby the Defense Department,
p53
aVbut it obviously worked really well,
p54
aVand we all saw what happened with the Internet.
p55
aVIt was incredibly successful.
p56
aa(lp57
VIn fact, it was so successful that there's no way
p58
aVthat these days you could make a book like this.
p59
aVMy rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.
p60
aVBut, of course, you couldn't do it,
p61
aVbecause we don't know the names of all the people
p62
aVwith Internet or email addresses,
p63
aVand even if we did know their names,
p64
aVI'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,
p65
aVaddress and telephone number published to everyone.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,
p68
aVand so we dealt with that by making
p69
aVwalled communities,
p70
aVsecure subnetworks, VPNs,
p71
aVlittle things that aren't really the Internet
p72
aVbut are made out of the same building blocks,
p73
aVbut we're still basically building it out of those
p74
aVsame building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.
p75
aVAnd that means that it's vulnerable
p76
aVto certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,
p77
aVor certain kinds of deliberate attacks,
p78
aVbut even the mistakes can be bad.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, for instance,
p81
aVin all of Asia recently,
p82
aVit was impossible to get YouTube for a little while
p83
aVbecause Pakistan made some mistakes
p84
aVin how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.
p85
aVThey didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did
p86
aVbecause of the way that the protocols work.
p87
aVAnother example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,
p88
aVyou may remember a couple of years ago,
p89
aVall the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded
p90
aVbecause a single routing card in Salt Lake City
p91
aVhad a bug in it.
p92
aVNow, you don't really think
p93
aVthat our airplane system depends on the Internet,
p94
aVand in some sense it doesn't.
p95
aVI'll come back to that later.
p96
aVBut the fact is that people couldn't take off
p97
aVbecause something was going wrong on the Internet,
p98
aVand the router card was down.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd so, there are many of those things that start to happen.
p101
aVNow, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
p102
aVAll of a sudden,
p103
aVa very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,
p104
aVincluding a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,
p105
aVstarted getting re-routed through China.
p106
aVSo for a few hours, it all passed through China.
p107
aVNow, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,
p108
aVand it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,
p109
aVbut certainly somebody could make
p110
aVa dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,
p111
aVand it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.
p112
aVImagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo if somebody really wanted to attack the United States
p115
aVor Western civilization these days,
p116
aVthey're not going to do it with tanks.
p117
aVThat will not succeed.
p118
aVWhat they'll probably do is something
p119
aVvery much like the attack that happened
p120
aVon the Iranian nuclear facility.
p121
aVNobody has claimed credit for that.
p122
aVThere was basically a factory of industrial machines.
p123
aVIt didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
p124
aVIt thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,
p125
aVbut it was possible for somebody to smuggle
p126
aVa USB drive in there, or something like that,
p127
aVand software got in there that causes the centrifuges,
p128
aVin that case, to actually destroy themselves.
p129
aVNow that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery
p130
aVor a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.
p131
aVAnd so there's a lot of \u2014 I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,
p132
aVabout worries about cyberattacks
p133
aVand defenses against those.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut the fact is, people are mostly focused on
p136
aVdefending the computers on the Internet,
p137
aVand there's been surprisingly little attention
p138
aVto defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.
p139
aVAnd I think we probably do need to pay
p140
aVsome more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.
p141
aVSo actually, in the early days,
p142
aVback when it was the ARPANET,
p143
aVthere were actually times \u2014 there was a particular time it failed completely
p144
aVbecause one single message processor
p145
aVactually got a bug in it.
p146
aVAnd the way the Internet works is
p147
aVthe routers are basically exchanging information
p148
aVabout how they can get messages to places,
p149
aVand this one processor, because of a broken card,
p150
aVdecided it could actually get a message
p151
aVto some place in negative time.
p152
aVSo, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
p153
aVSo of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere
p154
aVwas to send it to this guy,
p155
aVwho would send it back in time and get it there super early,
p156
aVso every message in the Internet
p157
aVstarted getting switched through this one node,
p158
aVand of course that clogged everything up.
p159
aVEverything started breaking.
p160
aVThe interesting thing was, though,
p161
aVthat the sysadmins were able to fix it,
p162
aVbut they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.
p163
aVNow, of course you couldn't do that today.
p164
aVI mean, everything off, it's like
p165
aVthe service call you get from the cable company,
p166
aVexcept for the whole world.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
p169
aVOne of the reasons is a lot of their telephones
p170
aVuse IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on
p171
aVthat go through the Internet right now,
p172
aVand so in fact we're becoming dependent on it
p173
aVfor more and more different things,
p174
aVlike when you take off from LAX,
p175
aVyou're really not thinking you're using the Internet.
p176
aVWhen you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.
p177
aVWhat's happening increasingly, though, is these systems
p178
aVare beginning to use the Internet.
p179
aVMost of them aren't based on the Internet yet,
p180
aVbut they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,
p181
aVfor administrative functions,
p182
aVand so if you take something like the cell phone system,
p183
aVwhich is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,
p184
aVInternet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
p185
aVin terms of some of the control and administrative functions,
p186
aVand it's so tempting to use these same building blocks
p187
aVbecause they work so well, they're cheap,
p188
aVthey're repeated, and so on.
p189
aVSo all of our systems, more and more,
p190
aVare starting to use the same technology
p191
aVand starting to depend on this technology.
p192
aVAnd so even a modern rocket ship these days
p193
aVactually uses Internet protocol to talk
p194
aVfrom one end of the rocket ship to the other.
p195
aVThat's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo we've built this system
p198
aVwhere we understand all the parts of it,
p199
aVbut we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,
p200
aVand it's gotten a very, very different scale
p201
aVthan it was designed for.
p202
aVAnd in fact, nobody really exactly understands
p203
aVall the things it's being used for right now.
p204
aVIt's turning into one of these big emergent systems
p205
aVlike the financial system, where we've designed all the parts
p206
aVbut nobody really exactly understands
p207
aVhow it operates and all the little details of it
p208
aVand what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.
p209
aVAnd so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet
p210
aVand saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,
p211
aVyou should treat it with the same skepticism
p212
aVthat you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy
p213
aVor a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
p214
aVThey have an informed opinion,
p215
aVbut it's changing so quickly that even the experts
p216
aVdon't know exactly what's going on.
p217
aVSo if you see one of these maps of the Internet,
p218
aVit's just somebody's guess.
p219
aVNobody really knows what the Internet is right now
p220
aVbecause it's different than it was an hour ago.
p221
aVIt's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd the problem with it is,
p224
aVI think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster
p225
aVlike the disaster we had in the financial system,
p226
aVwhere we take a system that's basically built on trust,
p227
aVwas basically built for a smaller-scale system,
p228
aVand we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits
p229
aVof how it was meant to operate.
p230
aVAnd so right now, I think it's literally true
p231
aVthat we don't know what the consequences
p232
aVof an effective denial-of-service attack
p233
aVon the Internet would be,
p234
aVand whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,
p235
aVand worse next year, and so on.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut so what we need is a plan B.
p238
aVThere is no plan B right now.
p239
aVThere's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept
p240
aVto be independent of the Internet,
p241
aVmade out of completely different sets of building blocks.
p242
aVSo what we need is something that doesn't necessarily
p243
aVhave to have the performance of the Internet,
p244
aVbut the police department has to be able
p245
aVto call up the fire department even without the Internet,
p246
aVor the hospitals have to order fuel oil.
p247
aVThis doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.
p248
aVIt's actually relatively simple to do, technically,
p249
aVbecause it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,
p250
aVexisting wireless infrastructure.
p251
aVIt's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut people won't decide to do it
p254
aVuntil they recognize the need for it,
p255
aVand that's the problem that we have right now.
p256
aVSo there's been plenty of people,
p257
aVplenty of us have been quietly arguing
p258
aVthat we should have this independent system for years,
p259
aVbut it's very hard to get people focused on plan B
p260
aVwhen plan A seems to be working so well.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo I think that, if people understand
p263
aVhow much we're starting to depend on the Internet,
p264
aVand how vulnerable it is,
p265
aVwe could get focused on
p266
aVjust wanting this other system to exist,
p267
aVand I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,
p268
aVI'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.
p269
aVIt's not that hard a problem.
p270
aVIt could definitely be done by people in this room.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd so I think that this is actually,
p273
aVof all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,
p274
aVthis is probably one of the very easiest to fix.
p275
aVSo I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you very much.
p278
