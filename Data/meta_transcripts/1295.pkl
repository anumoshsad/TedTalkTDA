VHow many of you had to fill out a web form
p4
aVwhere you've been asked to read
p5
aVa distorted sequence of characters like this?
p6
aVHow many of you found it really annoying?
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VOK, outstanding. So I invented that.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VOr I was one of the people who did it.
p15
aVThat thing is called a CAPTCHA.
p16
aVAnd it is there to make sure you, the entity filling out the form,
p17
aVare a human and not a computer program
p18
aVthat was written to submit the form millions of times.
p19
aVThe reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans,
p20
aVhave no trouble reading these distorted characters,
p21
aVwhereas programs can't do it as well yet.
p22
aVIn the case of Ticketmaster,
p23
aVthe reason you have to type these characters
p24
aVis to prevent scalpers from writing a program
p25
aVthat can buy millions of tickets, two at a time.
p26
aa(lp27
VCAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.
p28
aVAnd since they're used so often,
p29
aVa lot of times the sequence of random characters shown to the user
p30
aVis not so fortunate.
p31
aVSo this is an example from the Yahoo registration page.
p32
aVThe random characters that happened to be shown to the user
p33
aVwere W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word.
p34
aVBut the best part is the message
p35
aVthat the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later.
p36
aa(lp37
V[Help! I've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VThis person thought they needed to wait.
p42
aVThis, of course, is not as bad as this poor person.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VCAPTCHA Project is something that we did at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,
p47
aVand it's been used everywhere.
p48
aVLet me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later,
p49
aVwhich is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA.
p50
aVThis is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,
p51
aVwhich is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon,
p52
aVthen we turned it into a start-up company.
p53
aVAnd then about a year and a half ago, Google actually acquired this company.
p54
aa(lp55
VLet me tell you what this project started.
p56
aVThis project started from the following realization:
p57
aVIt turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs
p58
aVare typed everyday by people around the world.
p59
aVWhen I first heard this, I was quite proud of myself.
p60
aVI thought, look at the impact my research has had.
p61
aVBut then I started feeling bad.
p62
aVHere's the thing: each time you type a CAPTCHA,
p63
aVessentially, you waste 10 seconds of your time.
p64
aVAnd if you multiply that by 200 million,
p65
aVyou get that humanity is wasting about 500,000 hours every day
p66
aVtyping these annoying CAPTCHAs.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo then I started feeling bad.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd then I started thinking, of course, we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,
p75
aVbecause the security of the web depends on them.
p76
aVBut then I started thinking, can we use this effort
p77
aVfor something that is good for humanity?
p78
aVSo see, here's the thing.
p79
aVWhile you're typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds,
p80
aVyour brain is doing something amazing.
p81
aVYour brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do.
p82
aVSo can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?
p83
aVIs there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve,
p84
aVyet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks
p85
aVsuch that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA,
p86
aVthey solve a little bit of this problem?
p87
aVAnd the answer to that is "yes," and this is what we're doing now.
p88
aa(lp89
VNowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,
p90
aVnot only are you authenticating yourself as a human,
p91
aVbut in addition you're helping us to digitize books.
p92
aVLet me explain how this works.
p93
aVThere's a lot of projects trying to digitize books.
p94
aVGoogle has one. The Internet Archive has one.
p95
aVAmazon, with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books.
p96
aVBasically, the way this works is you start with an old book.
p97
aVYou've seen those things, right?
p98
aVLike a book?
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo you start with a book and then you scan it.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, scanning a book
p105
aVis like taking a digital photograph of every page.
p106
aVIt gives you an image for every page.
p107
aVThis is an image with text for every page of the book.
p108
aVThe next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able
p109
aVto decipher the words in this image.
p110
aVThat's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition,
p111
aVwhich takes a picture of text
p112
aVand tries to figure out what text is in there.
p113
aVNow, the problem is that OCR is not perfect.
p114
aVEspecially for older books
p115
aVwhere the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow,
p116
aVOCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.
p117
aVFor things that were written more than 50 years ago,
p118
aVthe computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.
p119
aVSo now we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize
p120
aVand we're getting people to read them for us
p121
aVwhile they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing
p124
aVare actually words from books that are being digitized
p125
aVthat the computer could not recognize.
p126
aVThe reason we have two words nowadays instead of one
p127
aVis because one of the words
p128
aVis a word that the system just got out of a book,
p129
aVit didn't know what it was and it's going to present it to you.
p130
aVBut since it doesn't know the answer, it cannot grade it.
p131
aVSo we give you another word,
p132
aVfor which the system does know the answer.
p133
aVWe don't tell you which one's which and we say, please type both.
p134
aVAnd if you type the correct word
p135
aVfor the one for which the system knows the answer,
p136
aVit assumes you are human
p137
aVand it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.
p138
aVAnd if we repeat this process to 10 different people
p139
aVand they agree on what the new word is,
p140
aVthen we get one more word digitized accurately.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this is how the system works.
p143
aVAnd since we released it about three or four years ago,
p144
aVa lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA,
p145
aVwhere people wasted their time,
p146
aVto the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.
p147
aVSo every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster,
p148
aVyou help to digitize a book.
p149
aVFacebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody,
p150
aVyou help to digitize a book.
p151
aVTwitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA.
p152
aVAnd the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high
p153
aVthat the number of words we're digitizing per day is really large.
p154
aVIt's about 100 million a day,
p155
aVwhich is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year.
p156
aVAnd this is all being done one word at a time
p157
aVby just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, of course,
p162
aVsince we're doing so many words per day,
p163
aVfunny things can happen.
p164
aVThis is especially true because now we're giving people
p165
aVtwo randomly chosen English words next to each other.
p166
aVSo funny things can happen.
p167
aVFor example, we presented this word.
p168
aVIt's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.
p169
aVBut if you present it along with another randomly chosen word,
p170
aVbad things can happen.
p171
aVSo we get this.
p172
aa(lp173
V[bad Christians]
p174
aa(lp175
VBut it's even worse, because the website where we showed this
p176
aVactually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VOops.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VHere's another really bad one.
p185
aVJohnEdwards.com
p186
aa(lp187
V[Damn liberal]
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VSo we keep on insulting people left and right everyday.
p192
aVOf course, we're not just insulting people.
p193
aVHere's the thing. Since we're presenting two randomly chosen words,
p194
aVinteresting things can happen.
p195
aVSo this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme
p196
aVthat tens of thousands of people have participated in,
p197
aVwhich is called CAPTCHA art.
p198
aVI'm sure some of you have heard about it.
p199
aVHere's how it works.
p200
aVImagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA
p201
aVthat you think is somewhat peculiar,
p202
aVlike this CAPTCHA.
p203
aa(lp204
V[invisible toaster]
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat you're supposed to do is you take a screenshot of it.
p207
aVThen of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book.
p208
aVBut first you take a screenshot
p209
aVand then you draw something that is related to it.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThat's how it works.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VThere are tens of thousands of these.
p218
aVSome of them are very cute.
p219
aa(lp220
V[clenched it]
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSome of them are funnier.
p225
aa(lp226
V[stoned Founders]
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd some of them, like paleontological shvisle ...
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
Vthey contain Snoop Dogg.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VOK, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA.
p239
aVSo this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project.
p240
aVThis is the number of distinct people
p241
aVthat have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:
p242
aV750 million, a little over 10 percent of the world's population,
p243
aVhas helped us digitize human knowledge.
p244
aVAnd it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda.
p245
aVSo the question that motivates my research is the following:
p246
aVIf you look at humanity's large-scale achievements,
p247
aVthese really big things
p248
aVthat humanity has gotten together and done historically \u2014
p249
aVlike, for example, building the pyramids of Egypt
p250
aVor the Panama Canal
p251
aVor putting a man on the Moon \u2014
p252
aVthere is a curious fact about them,
p253
aVand it is that they were all done with about the same number of people.
p254
aVIt's weird; they were all done with about 100,000 people.
p255
aVAnd the reason for that is because, before the Internet,
p256
aVcoordinating more than 100,000 people,
p257
aVlet alone paying them, was essentially impossible.
p258
aVBut now with the Internet, I've just shown you a project
p259
aVwhere we've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge.
p260
aVSo the question that motivates my research is,
p261
aVif we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000,
p262
aVwhat can we do with 100 million?
p263
aa(lp264
VSo based on this question,
p265
aVwe've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on.
p266
aVLet me tell you about one that I'm most excited about.
p267
aVThis is something that we've been semiquietly working on
p268
aVfor the last year and a half or so.
p269
aVIt hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo.
p270
aVSince it hasn't been launched, shhh!
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VYeah, I can trust you'll do that.
p275
aVSo this is the project. Here's how it started.
p276
aVIt started with me posing a question to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.
p277
aVOK, that's Severin Hacker.
p278
aVSo I posed the question to my graduate student.
p279
aVBy the way, you did hear me correctly; his last name is Hacker.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VSo I posed this question to him: How can we get 100 million people
p284
aVtranslating the web into every major language for free?
p285
aVThere's a lot of things to say about this question.
p286
aVFirst of all, translating the web.
p287
aVRight now, the web is partitioned into multiple languages.
p288
aVA large fraction of it is in English.
p289
aVIf you don't know English, you can't access it.
p290
aVBut there's large fractions in other different languages,
p291
aVand if you don't know them, you can't access it.
p292
aVSo I would like to translate all of the web,
p293
aVor at least most of it, into every major language.
p294
aVThat's what I would like to do.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow, some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate?
p297
aVMachine translation is starting to translate
p298
aVsome sentences here and there.
p299
aVWhy can't we use it to translate the web?
p300
aVThe problem with that is it's not yet good enough
p301
aVand it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years.
p302
aVIt makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't,
p303
aVsince it makes so many mistakes, you don't know whether to trust it or not.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo let me show you an example
p306
aVof something that was translated with a machine.
p307
aVActually, it was a forum post.
p308
aVIt was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript.
p309
aVIt was translated from Japanese into English.
p310
aVSo I'll just let you read.
p311
aVThis person starts apologizing
p312
aVfor the fact that it's translated with a computer.
p313
aVSo the next sentence is going to be the preamble to the question.
p314
aVSo he's just explaining something.
p315
aVRemember, it's a question about JavaScript.
p316
aa(lp317
V[At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit.]
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VThen comes the first part of the question.
p322
aa(lp323
V[How many times like the wind, a pole, and the dragon?]
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VThen comes my favorite part of the question.
p328
aa(lp329
V[This insult to father's stones?]
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd then comes the ending,
p334
aVwhich is my favorite part of the whole thing.
p335
aa(lp336
V[Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you.]
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VOK, so computer translation, not yet good enough.
p341
aVSo back to the question.
p342
aVSo we need people to translate the whole web.
p343
aVSo now the next question you may have is,
p344
aVwell, why can't we just pay people to do this?
p345
aVWe could pay professional translators to translate the whole web.
p346
aVWe could do that.
p347
aVUnfortunately, it would be extremely expensive.
p348
aVFor example, translating a tiny fraction of the whole web, Wikipedia,
p349
aVinto one other language, Spanish.
p350
aVOK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,
p351
aVbut it's very small compared to the size of English.
p352
aVIt's about 20 percent of the size of English.
p353
aVIf we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish,
p354
aVit would cost at least 50 million dollars \u2014
p355
aVand this is even at the most exploited, outsourcing country out there.
p356
aVSo it would be very expensive.
p357
aVSo what we want to do is, we want to get 100 million people
p358
aVtranslating the web into every major language for free.
p359
aa(lp360
VIf this is what you want to do, you quickly realize
p361
aVyou're going to run into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.
p362
aVThe first one is a lack of bilinguals.
p363
aVSo I don't even know
p364
aVif there exists 100 million people out there using the web
p365
aVwho are bilingual enough to help us translate.
p366
aVThat's a big problem.
p367
aVThe other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation.
p368
aVHow are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free?
p369
aVNormally, you have to pay people to do this.
p370
aVSo how are we going to motivate them to do it for free?
p371
aVWhen we were starting to think about this, we were blocked by these two things.
p372
aVBut then we realized, there's a way
p373
aVto solve both these problems with the same solution.
p374
aVTo kill two birds with one stone.
p375
aVAnd that is to transform language translation
p376
aVinto something that millions of people want to do
p377
aVand that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals,
p378
aVand that is language education.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo it turns out that today,
p381
aVthere are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language.
p382
aVPeople really want to learn a foreign language.
p383
aVAnd it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school.
p384
aVIn the US alone, there are over five million people
p385
aVwho have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language.
p386
aVSo people really want to learn a new language.
p387
aVSo what we've been working on for the last year and a half
p388
aVis a new website \u2014 it's called Duolingo \u2014
p389
aVwhere the basic idea is people learn a new language for free
p390
aVwhile simultaneously translating the web.
p391
aVAnd so basically, they're learning by doing.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo the way this works
p394
aVis whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very simple sentences.
p395
aVThere's a lot of very simple sentences on the web.
p396
aVWe give you very simple sentences along with what each word means.
p397
aVAnd as you translate them
p398
aVand as you see how other people translate them,
p399
aVyou start learning the language.
p400
aVAnd as you get more advanced,
p401
aVwe give you more complex sentences to translate.
p402
aVBut at all times, you're learning by doing.
p403
aa(lp404
VNow, the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works.
p405
aVPeople are really learning a language.
p406
aVWe're mostly done building it and now we're testing it.
p407
aVPeople really can learn a language with it.
p408
aVAnd they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.
p409
aVSo people really do learn a language.
p410
aVAnd not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's more interesting.
p411
aVBecause with Duolingo, people are learning with real content.
p412
aVAs opposed to learning with made-up sentences,
p413
aVpeople are learning with real content, which is inherently interesting.
p414
aVSo people really do learn a language.
p415
aa(lp416
VBut perhaps more surprisingly,
p417
aVthe translations that we get from people using the site,
p418
aVeven though they're just beginners,
p419
aVthe translations that we get
p420
aVare as accurate as those of professional language translators,
p421
aVwhich is very surprising.
p422
aVSo let me show you one example.
p423
aVThis is a sentence that was translated from German into English.
p424
aVThe top is the German. The middle is an English translation
p425
aVthat was done by a professional translator
p426
aVwho we paid 20 cents a word for this translation.
p427
aVAnd the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo,
p428
aVnone of whom knew any German before they started using the site.
p429
aVIf you can see, it's pretty much perfect.
p430
aVOf course, we play a trick here
p431
aVto make the translations as good as professional language translators.
p432
aVWe combine the translations of multiple beginners
p433
aVto get the quality of a single professional translator.
p434
aa(lp435
VNow, even though we're combining the translations,
p436
aVthe site actually can translate pretty fast.
p437
aVSo let me show you,
p438
aVthis is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia
p439
aVfrom English into Spanish.
p440
aVRemember, this is 50 million dollars' worth of value.
p441
aVSo if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish,
p442
aVwe could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users.
p443
aVAnd we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users.
p444
aVSince all the projects my group has worked on so far
p445
aVhave gotten millions of users,
p446
aVwe're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast.
p447
aa(lp448
VNow, the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo
p449
aVis I think this provides a fair business model for language education.
p450
aVSo here's the thing:
p451
aVThe current business model for language education
p452
aVis the student pays,
p453
aVand in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.
p454
aa(lp455
V(Laughter)
p456
aa(lp457
VThat's the current business model.
p458
aVThe problem with this business model
