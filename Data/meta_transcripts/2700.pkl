VWhat if our plants
p4
aVcould sense the toxicity levels in the soil
p5
aVand express that toxicity through the color of its leaves?
p6
aVWhat if those plants could also remove those toxins from the soil?
p7
aVInstead, what if those plants
p8
aVgrew their own packaging,
p9
aVor were designed to only be harvested
p10
aVby their owners' own patented machines?
p11
aVWhat happens when biological design
p12
aVis driven by the motivations of mass-produced commodities?
p13
aVWhat kind of world would that be?
p14
aa(lp15
VMy name is Ani, and I'm a designer and researcher at MIT Media Lab,
p16
aVwhere I'm part of a relatively new and unique group called Design Fiction,
p17
aVwhere we're wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact.
p18
aVAnd at MIT, I am lucky enough to rub shoulders with scientists
p19
aVstudying all kinds of cutting edge fields
p20
aVlike synthetic neurobiology,
p21
aVartificial intelligence, artificial life
p22
aVand everything in between.
p23
aVAnd across campus, there's truly brilliant scientists
p24
aVasking questions like, "How can I make the world a better place?"
p25
aVAnd part of what my group likes to ask is, "What is better?"
p26
aVWhat is better for you, for me,
p27
aVfor a white woman, a gay man,
p28
aVa veteran, a child with a prosthetic?
p29
aVTechnology is never neutral.
p30
aVIt frames a reality
p31
aVand reflects a context.
p32
aVCan you imagine what it would say about the work-life balance at your office
p33
aVif these were standard issue on the first day?
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VI believe it's the role of artists and designers
p38
aVto raise critical questions.
p39
aVArt is how you can see and feel the future,
p40
aVand today is an exciting time to be a designer,
p41
aVfor all the new tools becoming accessible.
p42
aVFor instance, synthetic biology
p43
aVseeks to write biology as a design problem.
p44
aVAnd through these developments,
p45
aVmy lab asks, what are the roles and responsibilities
p46
aVof an artist, designer, scientist or businessman?
p47
aVWhat are the implications
p48
aVof synthetic biology, genetic engineering,
p49
aVand how are they shaping our notions of what it means to be a human?
p50
aVWhat are the implications of this on society, on evolution
p51
aVand what are the stakes in this game?
p52
aa(lp53
VMy own speculative design research at the current moment
p54
aVplays with synthetic biology,
p55
aVbut for more emotionally driven output.
p56
aVI'm obsessed with olfaction as a design space,
p57
aVand this project started with this idea
p58
aVof what if you could take a smell selfie, a smelfie?
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VWhat if you could take your own natural body odor
p63
aVand send it to a lover?
p64
aVFunny enough, I found that this was a 19th century Austrian tradition,
p65
aVwhere couples in courtship would keep a slice of apple
p66
aVcrammed under their armpit during dances,
p67
aVand at the end of the evening,
p68
aVthe girl would give the guy she most fancied her used fruit,
p69
aVand if the feeling was mutual,
p70
aVhe would wolf down that stinky apple.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VFamously, Napoleon wrote many love letters to Josephine,
p75
aVbut perhaps amongst the most memorable is this brief and urgent note:
p76
aV"Home in three days. Don't bathe."
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VBoth Napoleon and Josephine adored violets.
p81
aVJosephine wore violet-scented perfume,
p82
aVcarried violets on their wedding day,
p83
aVand Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets
p84
aVevery year on their anniversary.
p85
aVWhen Josephine passed away,
p86
aVhe planted violets at her grave,
p87
aVand just before his exile,
p88
aVhe went back to that tomb site,
p89
aVpicked some of those flowers, entombed them in a locket
p90
aVand wore them until the day he died.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd I found this so moving,
p93
aVI thought, could I engineer that violet to smell just like Josephine?
p94
aVWhat if, for the rest of eternity,
p95
aVwhen you went to visit her site,
p96
aVyou could smell Josephine just as Napoleon loved her?
p97
aVCould we engineer new ways of mourning,
p98
aVnew rituals for remembering?
p99
aVAfter all, we've engineered transgenic crops
p100
aVto be maximized for profit,
p101
aVcrops that stand up to transport,
p102
aVcrops that have a long shelf life,
p103
aVcrops that taste sugary sweet but resist pests,
p104
aVsometimes at the expense of nutritional value.
p105
aVCan we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output?
p106
aa(lp107
VSo currently in my lab,
p108
aVI'm researching questions like, what makes a human smell like a human?
p109
aVAnd it turns out it's fairly complicated.
p110
aVFactors such as your diet, your medications, your lifestyle
p111
aVall factor into the way you smell.
p112
aVAnd I found that our sweat is mostly odorless,
p113
aVbut it's our bacteria and microbiome
p114
aVthat's responsible for your smells, your mood, your identity
p115
aVand so much beyond.
p116
aVAnd there's all kinds of molecules that you emit
p117
aVbut which we only perceive subconsciously.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I've been cataloging and collecting
p120
aVbacteria from different sites of my body.
p121
aVAfter talking to a scientist, we thought,
p122
aVmaybe the perfect concoction of Ani
p123
aVis like 10 percent collarbone, 30 percent underarm,
p124
aV40 percent bikini line and so forth,
p125
aVand occasionally I let researchers from other labs
p126
aVtake a sniff of my samples.
p127
aVAnd it's been interesting to hear how smell of the body
p128
aVis perceived outside of the context of the body.
p129
aVI've gotten feedback such as,
p130
aVsmells like flowers, like chicken,
p131
aVlike cornflakes,
p132
aVlike beef carnitas.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VAt the same time, I cultivate a set of carnivorous plants
p137
aVfor their ability to emit fleshlike odors to attract prey,
p138
aVin an attempt to kind of create this symbiotic relationship
p139
aVbetween my bacteria and this organism.
p140
aVAnd as it so happens, I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,
p141
aVand I was talking to a scientist
p142
aVwho happens to be a chemist and a plant scientist,
p143
aVand I was telling him about my project,
p144
aVand he was like, "Well, this sounds like botany for lonely women."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VUnperturbed, I said, "OK."
p149
aVI challenged him.
p150
aV"Can we engineer a plant that can love me back?"
p151
aVAnd for some reason, he was like, "Sure, why not?"
p152
aa(lp153
VSo we started with, can we get a plant to grow towards me
p154
aVlike I was the sun?
p155
aVAnd so we're looking at mechanisms in plants such as phototropism,
p156
aVwhich causes the plant to grow towards the sun
p157
aVby producing hormones like auxin,
p158
aVwhich causes cell elongation on the shady side.
p159
aVAnd right now I'm creating a set of lipsticks
p160
aVthat are infused with these chemicals
p161
aVthat allow me to interact with a plant on its own chemical signatures \u2014
p162
aVlipsticks that cause plants to grow where I kiss it,
p163
aVplants that blossom where I kiss the bloom.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd through these projects,
p166
aVI'm asking questions like,
p167
aVhow do we define nature?
p168
aVHow do we define nature when we can reengineer its properties,
p169
aVand when should we do it?
p170
aVShould we do it for profit, for utility?
p171
aVCan we do it for emotional ends?
p172
aVCan biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music?
p173
aVWhat are the thresholds between science
p174
aVand its ability to shape our emotional landscape?
p175
aa(lp176
VIt's a famous design mantra that form follows function.
p177
aVWell, now, wedged somewhere between science, design and art
p178
aVI get to ask,
p179
aVwhat if fiction informs fact?
p180
aVWhat kind of R&D lab would that look like
p181
aVand what kind of questions would we ask together?
p182
aa(lp183
VWe often look to technology as the answer,
p184
aVbut as an artist and designer,
p185
aVI like to ask, but what is the question?
p186
aa(lp187
VThank you.
