VIn the space that used to house one transistor,
p4
aVwe can now fit one billion.
p5
aVThat made it so that a computer the size of an entire room
p6
aVnow fits in your pocket.
p7
aVYou might say the future is small.
p8
aa(lp9
VAs an engineer,
p10
aVI'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers.
p11
aVAs a physician,
p12
aVI wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost
p13
aVdue to one of the fastest-growing diseases on Earth:
p14
aVcancer.
p15
aVNow when I say that,
p16
aVwhat most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer.
p17
aVAnd we are.
p18
aVBut it turns out
p19
aVthat there's an incredible opportunity to save lives
p20
aVthrough the early detection and prevention of cancer.
p21
aa(lp22
VWorldwide, over two-thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable
p23
aVusing methods that we already have in hand today.
p24
aVThings like vaccination, timely screening
p25
aVand of course, stopping smoking.
p26
aVBut even with the best tools and technologies that we have today,
p27
aVsome tumors can't be detected
p28
aVuntil 10 years after they've started growing,
p29
aVwhen they are 50 million cancer cells strong.
p30
aVWhat if we had better technologies
p31
aVto detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner,
p32
aVwhen they could be removed,
p33
aVwhen they were just getting started?
p34
aa(lp35
VLet me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there.
p36
aVThis is a microscope in a typical lab
p37
aVthat a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen,
p38
aVlike a biopsy or a pap smear.
p39
aVThis $7,000 microscope
p40
aVwould be used by somebody with years of specialized training
p41
aVto spot cancer cells.
p42
aVThis is an image from a colleague of mine at Rice University,
p43
aVRebecca Richards-Kortum.
p44
aVWhat she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope
p45
aVinto this $10 part,
p46
aVand it fits on the end of an optical fiber.
p47
aVNow what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient
p48
aVand sending it to the microscope,
p49
aVyou can bring the microscope to the patient.
p50
aVAnd then, instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images,
p51
aVyou can train the computer to score normal versus cancerous cells.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow this is important,
p54
aVbecause what they found working in rural communities,
p55
aVis that even when they have a mobile screening van
p56
aVthat can go out into the community and perform exams
p57
aVand collect samples
p58
aVand send them to the central hospital for analysis,
p59
aVthat days later,
p60
aVwomen get a call with an abnormal test result
p61
aVand they're asked to come in.
p62
aVFully half of them don't turn up because they can't afford the trip.
p63
aVWith the integrated microscope and computer analysis,
p64
aVRebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van
p65
aVthat has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup.
p66
aVAnd what that means is that they can do a diagnosis
p67
aVand perform therapy on the spot,
p68
aVso no one is lost to follow up.
p69
aa(lp70
VThat's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives.
p71
aVNow as engineers,
p72
aVwe think of this as straight-up miniaturization.
p73
aVYou took a big thing and you made it little.
p74
aVBut what I told you before about computers
p75
aVwas that they transformed our lives
p76
aVwhen they became small enough for us to take them everywhere.
p77
aVSo what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine?
p78
aVWell, what if you had a detector
p79
aVthat was so small that it could circulate in your body,
p80
aVfind the tumor all by itself
p81
aVand send a signal to the outside world?
p82
aVIt sounds a little bit like science fiction.
p83
aVBut actually, nanotechnology allows us to do just that.
p84
aVNanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector
p85
aVfrom the width of a human hair,
p86
aVwhich is 100 microns,
p87
aVto a thousand times smaller,
p88
aVwhich is 100 nanometers.
p89
aVAnd that has profound implications.
p90
aa(lp91
VIt turns out that materials actually change their properties
p92
aVat the nanoscale.
p93
aVYou take a common material like gold,
p94
aVand you grind it into dust, into gold nanoparticles,
p95
aVand it changes from looking gold to looking red.
p96
aVIf you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide \u2014
p97
aVforms a big, black crystal \u2014
p98
aVif you make nanocrystals out of this material
p99
aVand you put it in a liquid,
p100
aVand you shine light on it,
p101
aVthey glow.
p102
aVAnd they glow blue, green, yellow, orange, red,
p103
aVdepending only on their size.
p104
aVIt's wild! Can you imagine an object like that in the macro world?
p105
aVIt would be like all the denim jeans in your closet are all made of cotton,
p106
aVbut they are different colors depending only on their size.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VSo as a physician,
p111
aVwhat's just as interesting to me
p112
aVis that it's not just the color of materials
p113
aVthat changes at the nanoscale;
p114
aVthe way they travel in your body also changes.
p115
aVAnd this is the kind of observation that we're going to use
p116
aVto make a better cancer detector.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo let me show you what I mean.
p119
aVThis is a blood vessel in the body.
p120
aVSurrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.
p121
aVWe're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel
p122
aVand watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor.
p123
aVNow it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky,
p124
aVand so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor.
p125
aVWhether they leak out depends on their size.
p126
aVSo in this image,
p127
aVthe smaller, hundred-nanometer, blue nanoparticles are leaking out,
p128
aVand the larger, 500-nanometer, red nanoparticles
p129
aVare stuck in the bloodstream.
p130
aVSo that means as an engineer,
p131
aVdepending on how big or small I make a material,
p132
aVI can change where it goes in your body.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn my lab, we recently made a cancer nanodetector
p135
aVthat is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors.
p136
aVWe designed it to listen for tumor invasion:
p137
aVthe orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread.
p138
aVFor a tumor to break out of the tissue that it's born in,
p139
aVit has to make chemicals called enzymes
p140
aVto chew through the scaffolding of tissues.
p141
aVWe designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes.
p142
aVOne enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour.
p143
aVNow in engineering, we call that one-to-a-thousand ratio
p144
aVa form of amplification,
p145
aVand it makes something ultrasensitive.
p146
aVSo we've made an ultrasensitive cancer detector.
p147
aa(lp148
VOK, but how do I get this activated signal to the outside world,
p149
aVwhere I can act on it?
p150
aVFor this, we're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology,
p151
aVand that has to do with the kidney.
p152
aVThe kidney is a filter.
p153
aVIts job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine.
p154
aVIt turns out that what the kidney filters
p155
aVis also dependent on size.
p156
aVSo in this image, what you can see
p157
aVis that everything smaller than five nanometers
p158
aVis going from the blood, through the kidney, into the urine,
p159
aVand everything else that's bigger is retained.
p160
aVOK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector,
p161
aVI inject it in the bloodstream,
p162
aVit can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes
p163
aVto release a small signal
p164
aVthat is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney
p165
aVand put into the urine,
p166
aVI have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.
p167
aa(lp168
VOK, but there's one more problem.
p169
aVThis is a tiny little signal,
p170
aVso how do I detect it?
p171
aVWell, the signal is just a molecule.
p172
aVThey're molecules that we designed as engineers.
p173
aVThey're completely synthetic, and we can design them
p174
aVso they are compatible with our tool of choice.
p175
aVIf we want to use a really sensitive, fancy instrument
p176
aVcalled a mass spectrometer,
p177
aVthen we make a molecule with a unique mass.
p178
aVOr maybe we want make something that's more inexpensive and portable.
p179
aVThen we make molecules that we can trap on paper,
p180
aVlike a pregnancy test.
p181
aVIn fact, there's a whole world of paper tests
p182
aVthat are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics.
p183
aa(lp184
VAlright, where are we going with this?
p185
aVWhat I'm going to tell you next,
p186
aVas a lifelong researcher,
p187
aVrepresents a dream of mine.
p188
aVI can't say that's it's a promise;
p189
aVit's a dream.
p190
aVBut I think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward,
p191
aVeven \u2014 and maybe especially \u2014 cancer researchers.
p192
aa(lp193
VI'm going to tell you what I hope will happen with my technology,
p194
aVthat my team and I will put our hearts and souls
p195
aVinto making a reality.
p196
aVOK, here goes.
p197
aVI dream that one day,
p198
aVinstead of going into an expensive screening facility
p199
aVto get a colonoscopy,
p200
aVor a mammogram,
p201
aVor a pap smear,
p202
aVthat you could get a shot,
p203
aVwait an hour,
p204
aVand do a urine test on a paper strip.
p205
aVI imagine that this could even happen
p206
aVwithout the need for steady electricity,
p207
aVor a medical professional in the room.
p208
aVMaybe they could be far away
p209
aVand connected only by the image on a smartphone.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow I know this sounds like a dream,
p212
aVbut in the lab we already have this working in mice,
p213
aVwhere it works better than existing methods
p214
aVfor the detection of lung, colon and ovarian cancer.
p215
aVAnd I hope that what this means
p216
aVis that one day we can detect tumors in patients
p217
aVsooner than 10 years after they've started growing,
p218
aVin all walks of life,
p219
aVall around the globe,
p220
aVand that this would lead to earlier treatments,
p221
aVand that we could save more lives than we can today,
p222
aVwith early detection.
