VHave you ever noticed when you ask someone to talk
p4
aVabout a change they're making for the better in their personal lives,
p5
aVthey're often really energetic?
p6
aVWhether it's training for a marathon,
p7
aVpicking up an old hobby,
p8
aVor learning a new skill,
p9
aVfor most people,
p10
aVself-transformation projects occupy a very positive emotional space.
p11
aa(lp12
VSelf-transformation is empowering,
p13
aVenergizing, even exhilarating.
p14
aVI mean just take a look at some of the titles of self-help books:
p15
aV"Awaken the Giant Within,"
p16
aV"Practicing the Power of Now,"
p17
aVor here's a great one we can all relate to,
p18
aV"You are a Badass:
p19
aVHow to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VWhen it comes to self-transformation,
p24
aVyou can't help but get a sense of the excitement.
p25
aVBut there's another type of transformation
p26
aVthat occupies a very different emotional space.
p27
aVThe transformation of organizations.
p28
aVIf you're like most people,
p29
aVwhen you hear the words "Our organization is going to start a transformation,"
p30
aVyou're thinking, "Uh-oh."
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V"Layoffs."
p35
aVThe blood drains from your face,
p36
aVyour mind goes into overdrive,
p37
aVfrantically searching for some place to run and hide.
p38
aa(lp39
VWell, you can run,
p40
aVbut you really can't hide.
p41
aVMost of us spend the majority of our waking hours
p42
aVinvolved in organizations.
p43
aVAnd due to changes in globalization,
p44
aVchanges due to advances in technology
p45
aVand other factors,
p46
aVthe reality is our organizations are constantly having to adapt.
p47
aVIn fact,
p48
aVI call this the era of "always-on" transformation.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen I shared this idea with my wife Nicola,
p51
aVshe said, "Always-on transformation?
p52
aVThat sounds exhausting."
p53
aVAnd that may be exactly what you're thinking \u2014
p54
aVand you would be right.
p55
aVParticularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations
p56
aVthe way we always have been.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut because we can't hide,
p59
aVwe need to sort out two things.
p60
aVFirst,
p61
aVwhy is transformation so exhausting?
p62
aVAnd second, how do we fix it?
p63
aa(lp64
VFirst of all,
p65
aVlet's acknowledge that change is hard.
p66
aVPeople naturally resist change,
p67
aVespecially when it's imposed on them.
p68
aVBut there are things that organizations do that make change even harder
p69
aVand more exhausting for people than it needs to be.
p70
aVFirst of all,
p71
aVleaders often wait too long to act.
p72
aVAs a result,
p73
aVeverything is happening in crisis mode.
p74
aVWhich, of course, tends to be exhausting.
p75
aVOr, given the urgency,
p76
aVwhat they'll do is they'll just focus on the short-term results,
p77
aVbut that doesn't give any hope for the future.
p78
aVOr they'll just take a superficial, one-off approach,
p79
aVhoping that they can return back to business as usual
p80
aVas soon as the crisis is over.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis kind of approach
p83
aVis kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests.
p84
aVIn order to get test scores to go up,
p85
aVteachers will end up teaching to the test.
p86
aVNow, that approach can work;
p87
aVtest results often do go up.
p88
aVBut it fails the fundamental goal of education:
p89
aVto prepare students to succeed over the long term.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo given these obstacles,
p92
aVwhat can we do
p93
aVto transform the way we transform organizations
p94
aVso rather than being exhausting,
p95
aVit's actually empowering and energizing?
p96
aVTo do that, we need to focus on five strategic imperatives,
p97
aVall of which have one thing in common:
p98
aVputting people first.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe first imperative for putting people first
p101
aVis to inspire through purpose.
p102
aVMost transformations have financial and operational goals.
p103
aVThese are important and they can be energizing to leaders,
p104
aVbut they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization.
p105
aVTo motivate more broadly,
p106
aVthe transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose.
p107
aa(lp108
VTake LEGO.
p109
aVThe LEGO Group has become an extraordinary global company.
p110
aVUnder their very capable leadership,
p111
aVthey've actually undergone a series of transformations.
p112
aVWhile each of these has had a very specific focus,
p113
aVthe North Star,
p114
aVlinking and guiding all of them,
p115
aVhas been Lego's powerful purpose:
p116
aVinspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.
p117
aVExpanding globally?
p118
aVIt's not about increasing sales,
p119
aVbut about giving millions of additional children access to LEGO building bricks.
p120
aVInvestment and innovation?
p121
aVIt's not about developing new products,
p122
aVbut about enabling more children
p123
aVto experience the joy of learning through play.
p124
aVNot surprisingly,
p125
aVthat deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe second imperative for putting people first
p128
aVis to go all in.
p129
aVToo many transformations
p130
aVare nothing more than head-count cutting exercises;
p131
aVlayoffs under the guise of transformation.
p132
aVIn the face of relentless competition,
p133
aVit may well be that you will have to take the painful decision
p134
aVto downsize the organization,
p135
aVjust as you may have to lose some weight in order to run a marathon.
p136
aVBut losing weight alone
p137
aVwill not get you across the finish line with a winning time.
p138
aVTo win
p139
aVyou need to go all in.
p140
aVYou need to go all in.
p141
aVRather than just cutting costs,
p142
aVyou need to think about initiatives
p143
aVthat will enable you to win in the medium term,
p144
aVinitiatives to drive growth,
p145
aVactions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates,
p146
aVand very importantly,
p147
aVinvestments to develop the leadership and the talent.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe third imperative for putting people first
p150
aVis to enable people with the capabilities
p151
aVthat they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond.
p152
aVOver the years I've competed in a number of triathlons.
p153
aVYou know, frankly, I'm not that good,
p154
aVbut I do have one distinct capability;
p155
aVI am remarkably fast at finding my bike.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VBy the time I finish the swim,
p160
aValmost all the bikes are already gone.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VReal triathletes know that each leg \u2014
p165
aVthe swim, the bike, the run \u2014
p166
aVreally requires different capabilities,
p167
aVdifferent tools,
p168
aVdifferent skills, different techniques.
p169
aVLikewise when we transform organizations,
p170
aVwe need to be sure that we're giving our people
p171
aVthe skills and the tools they need along the way.
p172
aa(lp173
VChronos,
p174
aVa global software company,
p175
aVrecognized the need to transfer from building products \u2014
p176
aVsoftware products \u2014
p177
aVto building software as a service.
p178
aVTo enable its people to take that transformation,
p179
aVfirst of all they invested in new tools
p180
aVthat would enable their employees to monitor the usage of the features
p181
aVas well as customer satisfaction with the new service.
p182
aVThey also invested in skill development,
p183
aVso that their employees would be able
p184
aVto resolve customer service problems on the spot.
p185
aVAnd very importantly,
p186
aVthey also reinforced the collaborative behaviors that would be required
p187
aVto deliver an end-to-end seamless customer experience.
p188
aVBecause of these investments,
p189
aVrather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation,
p190
aVChronos employees actually felt energized
p191
aVand empowered in their new roles.
p192
aa(lp193
VIn the era of "always-on" transformation,
p194
aVchange is a constant.
p195
aVMy fourth imperative therefore
p196
aVis to instill a culture of continuous learning.
p197
aVWhen Satya Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft
p198
aVin February 2014,
p199
aVhe embarked on an ambitious transformation journey
p200
aVto prepare the company to compete in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.
p201
aVThis included changes to strategy,
p202
aVthe organization
p203
aVand very importantly, the culture.
p204
aVMicrosoft's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition \u2014
p205
aVnot exactly conducive to learning.
p206
aVNadella took this head-on.
p207
aVHe rallied his leadership around his vision
p208
aVfor a living, learning culture,
p209
aVshifting from a fixed mindset,
p210
aVwhere your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room,
p211
aVto a growth mindset,
p212
aVwhere your role was to listen, to learn and to bring out the best in people.
p213
aVWell, early days,
p214
aVMicrosoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture \u2014
p215
aVclear evidence of Microsoft putting people first.
p216
aa(lp217
VMy fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders.
p218
aVIn a transformation,
p219
aVa leader needs to have a vision,
p220
aVa clear road map with milestones,
p221
aVand then you need to hold people accountable for results.
p222
aVIn other words, you need to be directive.
p223
aVBut in order to capture the hearts and minds of people,
p224
aVyou also need to be inclusive.
p225
aVInclusive leadership is critical to putting people first.
p226
aa(lp227
VI live in the San Francisco Bay area.
p228
aVAnd right now,
p229
aVour basketball team is the best in the league.
p230
aVWe won the 2015 championship,
p231
aVand we're favored to win again this year.
p232
aVThere are many explanations for this.
p233
aVThey have some fabulous players,
p234
aVbut one of the key reasons
p235
aVis their head coach, Steve Kerr, is an inclusive leader.
p236
aVWhen Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,
p237
aVthe Warriors were looking for a major transformation.
p238
aVThey hadn't won a national championship since 1975.
p239
aa(lp240
VKerr came in, and he had a clear vision,
p241
aVand he immediately got to work.
p242
aVFrom the outset,
p243
aVhe reached out and engaged the players and the staff.
p244
aVHe created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions.
p245
aVDuring games he would often ask,
p246
aV"What are you seeing that I'm missing?"
p247
aa(lp248
VOne the best examples of this came in game four of the 2015 finals.
p249
aVThe Warriors were down two games to one
p250
aVwhen Kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup;
p251
aVa bold move by any measure.
p252
aVThe Warriors won the game and went on to win the championship.
p253
aVAnd it is widely viewed
p254
aVthat that move was the pivotal move in their victory.
p255
aa(lp256
VInterestingly, it wasn't actually Kerr's idea.
p257
aVIt was the idea of his 28-year-old assistant, Nick U'Ren.
p258
aVBecause of Kerr's leadership style,
p259
aVU'Ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward.
p260
aVAnd Kerr not only listened,
p261
aVbut he implemented the idea
p262
aVand then afterwards,
p263
aVgave U'Ren all the credit \u2014
p264
aVactions all consistent with Kerr's highly inclusive approach to leadership.
p265
aa(lp266
VIn the era of "always-on" transformation,
p267
aVorganizations are always going to be transforming.
p268
aVBut doing so does not have to be exhausting.
p269
aVWe owe it to ourselves,
p270
aVto our organizations
p271
aVand to society more broadly
p272
aVto boldly transform our approach to transformation.
p273
aVTo do that,
p274
aVwe need to start putting people first.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.
