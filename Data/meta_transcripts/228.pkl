VA great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity
p4
aVis to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,
p5
aVwhat's going on with no difficulty at all.
p6
aVThe best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,
p7
aVand my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable
p8
aVbut would miss the point.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVHe would have a great time.
p11
aVAnd of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,
p12
aVa speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,
p13
aVhe had a secret weapon yesterday,
p14
aVliterally, in his sword swallowing act.
p15
aVAnd I must say, I thought of quite a few objects
p16
aVthat I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,
p17
aVbut he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,
p20
aVbut that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare
p21
aVwas pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,
p22
aVso we're actually looking forward to it.
p23
aVWe go to magic shows in order to be fooled.
p24
aVAnd this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually
p25
aVget any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd our friend, Betty Edwards,
p28
aVthe "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables
p29
aVto her drawing class and says,
p30
aV"The problem you have with learning to draw
p31
aVis not that you can't move your hand,
p32
aVbut that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
p33
aVIt's trying to perceive images into objects
p34
aVrather than seeing what's there."
p35
aVAnd to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops
p36
aVis the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."
p37
aVShe does this with cardboard, but since I have
p38
aVan expensive computer here
p39
aVI'll just rotate this little guy around and ...
p40
aVNow having seen that \u2014 and I've seen it hundreds of times,
p41
aVbecause I use this in every talk I give \u2014 I still can't see
p42
aVthat they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.
p45
aVThey measure very, very carefully.
p46
aVAnd if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,
p47
aVyou'll see that those two shapes are
p48
aVexactly the same size.
p49
aVAnd the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,
p50
aV"We see things not as they are, but as we are."
p51
aVI certainly would like to know what happened to the person
p52
aVwho had that insight back then,
p53
aVif they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,
p56
aVthen what we call reality is a kind of hallucination
p57
aVhappening inside here. It's a waking dream,
p58
aVand understanding that that is what we actually exist in
p59
aVis one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
p60
aVAnd what that means: "simple and understandable"
p61
aVmight not be actually simple or understandable,
p62
aVand things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
p63
aVSomehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
p64
aVWe can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.
p65
aVThe way I think of it is, we can't learn to see
p66
aVuntil we admit we're blind.
p67
aVOnce you start down at this very humble level,
p68
aVthen you can start finding ways to see things.
p69
aVAnd what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,
p70
aVis that human beings have invented "brainlets" \u2014
p71
aVlittle additional parts for our brain \u2014
p72
aVmade out of powerful ideas that help us
p73
aVsee the world in different ways.
p74
aVAnd these are in the form of sensory apparatus \u2014
p75
aVtelescopes, microscopes \u2014 reasoning apparatus \u2014
p76
aVvarious ways of thinking \u2014 and, most importantly,
p77
aVin the ability to change perspective on things.
p78
aa(lp79
VI'll talk about that a little bit.
p80
aVIt's this change in perspective
p81
aVon what it is we think we're perceiving
p82
aVthat has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years
p83
aVthan we have in the rest of human history.
p84
aVAnd yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo one of the things that goes from simple to complex
p87
aVis when we do more. We like more.
p88
aVIf we do more in a kind of a stupid way,
p89
aVthe simplicity gets complex
p90
aVand, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.
p91
aVBut Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;
p92
aVanother name for them could be "architecture"
p93
aVas a metaphor for taking the same old material
p94
aVand thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.
p95
aVAnd in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature \u2014
p96
aVof having the descriptions
p97
aVat various levels be rather similar \u2014
p98
aVall goes down to the idea that the elementary particles
p99
aVare both sticky and standoffish,
p100
aVand they're in violent motion.
p101
aVThose three things give rise to all the different levels
p102
aVof what seem to be complexity in our world.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut how simple?
p105
aVSo, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,
p106
aVI just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen
p107
aVin conveying complex ideas simply.
p108
aVBut then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."
p109
aVAnd I put some effort in to try and check
p110
aVto see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time
p111
aVactually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,
p112
aVand I found that they matched up very well.
p113
aVSo the Roslings have been able to do simplicity
p114
aVwithout removing what's important about the data.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhereas the film yesterday that we saw
p117
aVof the simulation of the inside of a cell,
p118
aVas a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.
p119
aVNot because it wasn't beautiful or anything,
p120
aVbut because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
p121
aVabout molecular biology, and that is:
p122
aVwhy is there any probability at all of two complex shapes
p123
aVfinding each other just the right way
p124
aVso they combine together and be catalyzed?
p125
aVAnd what we saw yesterday was
p126
aVevery reaction was fortuitous;
p127
aVthey just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.
p128
aVBut in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of
p129
aVabout a million revolutions per second;
p130
aVthey're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;
p131
aVthey're completely crowded together, they're jammed,
p132
aVthey're bashing up against each other.
p133
aVAnd if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,
p134
aVwhat happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,
p135
aVand I think that's exactly the wrong image
p136
aVfor when you're trying to teach science.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication
p139
aVwith the actual understanding of some principle.
p140
aVSo a kid who's 14 in high school
p141
aVgets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,
p142
aVwhich is a truly subtle and interesting proof,
p143
aVbut in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.
p144
aVSo a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,
p145
aVis something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:
p146
aVso here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with
p147
aVthree more triangles and we copy that,
p148
aVnotice that we can move those triangles down like this.
p149
aVAnd that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
p150
aVand bingo. That is all you have to do.
p151
aVAnd this kind of proof is the kind of proof
p152
aVthat you need to learn when you're learning mathematics
p153
aVin order to get an idea of what it means
p154
aVbefore you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs
p155
aVof Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow let's go to young children.
p158
aVThis is a very unusual teacher
p159
aVwho was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,
p160
aVbut was a natural mathematician.
p161
aVSo she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music
p162
aVbut is a terrific musician;
p163
aVshe just had a feeling for math.
p164
aVAnd here are her six-year-olds,
p165
aVand she's got them making shapes out of a shape.
p166
aVSo they pick a shape they like \u2014 like a diamond, or a square,
p167
aVor a triangle, or a trapezoid \u2014 and then they try and make
p168
aVthe next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.
p169
aVYou can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd what this teacher did on every project
p172
aVwas to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,
p173
aVand then something like science.
p174
aVSo they had created these artifacts.
p175
aVNow she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,
p176
aVwhich I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was
p177
aVto slow them down so they'll think.
p178
aVSo they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here
p179
aVand pasting them up.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut the whole point of this thing is
p182
aVfor them to look at this chart and fill it out.
p183
aV"What have you noticed about what you did?"
p184
aVAnd so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,
p185
aVand the second one took three more
p186
aVand the total was four on that one,
p187
aVthe third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,
p188
aVand then the next one.
p189
aVShe saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add
p190
aVaround the edges was always going to grow by two,
p191
aVso she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.
p192
aVAnd she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,
p193
aVwhere she wasn't sure what six times six was
p194
aVand what seven times seven was,
p195
aVbut then she was confident again.
p196
aVSo that's what Lauren did.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids
p199
aVbring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,
p200
aVand everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"
p201
aVNo matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.
p202
aVAnd the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd
p203
aVwill recognize these two progressions
p204
aVas a first-order discrete differential equation
p205
aVand a second-order discrete differential equation,
p206
aVderived by six-year-olds.
p207
aVWell, that's pretty amazing.
p208
aVThat isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.
p211
aVAnd so the first idea here is
p212
aVjust to show you the kind of things that children do.
p213
aVI'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.
p214
aVSo I'd like to draw a little car here \u2014
p215
aVI'll just do this very quickly \u2014 and put a big tire on him.
p216
aVAnd I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,
p217
aVI'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.
p218
aVEach time I click it, car turn.
p219
aVIf I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,
p220
aVI just drag these guys out and set them going.
p221
aVAnd I can try steering the car here by ...
p222
aVSee the car turn by five here?
p223
aVSo what if I click this down to zero?
p224
aVIt goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
p225
aVMake it go in the other direction.
p226
aVBut of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister
p227
aVas far as driving a car,
p228
aVso the kids want to do a steering wheel;
p229
aVso they draw a steering wheel.
p230
aVAnd we'll call this a wheel.
p231
aVSee this wheel's heading here?
p232
aVIf I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.
p233
aVThat's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of
p234
aVthose numbers coming out there
p235
aVand to just drop it into the script here,
p236
aVand now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd it's interesting.
p239
aVYou know how much trouble the children have with variables,
p240
aVbut by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,
p241
aVthey never forget from this single trial
p242
aVwhat a variable is and how to use it.
p243
aVAnd we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.
p244
aVSo if you look at the little script here,
p245
aVthe speed is always going to be 30.
p246
aVWe're going to move the car according to that over and over again.
p247
aVAnd I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;
p248
aVthey're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.
p249
aVAnd what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did
p250
aVof saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,
p251
aVand then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?
p252
aVWhat do I get there?"
p253
aVWe get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo how do the children do science?
p256
aa(lp257
V(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.
p258
aa(lp259
VStudent 1: Ooh, this is nice.
p260
aa(lp261
VTeacher: Do not pay any attention
p262
aVto what anybody else is doing.
p263
aVWho's got the apple?
p264
aa(lp265
VAlan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.
p266
aVStudent 2: What did you get? What did you get?
p267
aVAK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
p268
aa(lp269
VStudent 3: 0.99 seconds.
p270
aa(lp271
VTeacher: So put "sponge ball" ...
p272
aa(lp273
VStudent 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball
p274
aVbecause they're two totally different weights,
p275
aVand if you drop them at the same time,
p276
aVmaybe they'll drop at the same speed.
p277
aa(lp278
VTeacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
p279
aa(lp280
VAK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child
p281
aVabout this particular point
p282
aVbecause, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,
p283
aVand neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
p284
aVAnd it was not until Galileo actually did it
p285
aVthat an adult thought like a child,
p286
aVonly 400 years ago.
p287
aVWe get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids
p288
aVwho will actually cut straight to the chase.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, what if we want to look at this more closely?
p291
aVWe can take a movie of what's going on,
p292
aVbut even if we single stepped this movie,
p293
aVit's tricky to see what's going on.
p294
aVAnd so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side
p295
aVor stack them up.
p296
aVSo when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"
p297
aVremembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,
p298
aVand they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.
p299
aVSo what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image
p300
aVto the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,
p301
aVlike that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,
p302
aVand if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase
p303
aVin the speed is constant.
p304
aVAnd they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.
p305
aVWe've done that already."
p306
aVAnd how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?
p307
aVSo you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,
p308
aVbut if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,
p309
aVwe can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
p310
aa(lp311
VGalileo, by the way, did this very cleverly
p312
aVby running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.
p313
aVI pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
p314
aVthis is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,
p315
aVbut it's a great story.
p316
aVAnd I thought I would do just one thing
p317
aVon the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.
p318
aVSo once you have gravity, here's this \u2014
p319
aVincrease the speed by something,
p320
aVincrease the ship's speed.
p321
aVIf I start the little game here that the kids have done,
p322
aVit'll crash the space ship.
p323
aVBut if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aVOne more.
p326
aVYeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?
p327
aa(lp328
VI guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:
p329
aVMarshall McLuhan said,
p330
aV"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"
p331
aVbut in fact, if you think of it,
p332
aVchildren are the future we send to the future.
p333
aVForget about messages;
p334
aVchildren are the future,
p335
aVand children in the first and second world
p336
aVand, most especially, in the third world
p337
aVneed mentors.
p338
aVAnd this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,
p339
aVand maybe 50 million next year.
p340
aVBut we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.
p341
aVThat means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,
p342
aVbut the mentoring that is required to go
p343
aVfrom a simple new iChat instant messaging system
p344
aVto something with depth is missing.
p345
aVI believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,
p346
aVand this new kind of user interface could be done
p347
aVwith an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.
p348
aVIt sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq \u2014
p349
aVwe're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars \u2014
p350
aVso this is actually cheap.
p351
aVAnd Einstein said,
p352
aV"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."
p353
aVThank you.
