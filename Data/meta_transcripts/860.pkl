VAbout a year ago,
p4
aVI asked myself a question:
p5
aV"Knowing what I know,
p6
aVwhy am I not a vegetarian?"
p7
aVAfter all, I'm one of the green guys:
p8
aVI grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
p9
aVI started a site called TreeHugger \u2014
p10
aVI care about this stuff.
p11
aVI knew that eating a mere hamburger a day
p12
aVcan increase my risk of dying by a third.
p13
aVCruelty: I knew that the 10 billion
p14
aVanimals we raise each year for meat
p15
aVare raised in factory farm conditions
p16
aVthat we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider
p17
aVfor our own cats, dogs and other pets.
p18
aVEnvironmentally, meat, amazingly,
p19
aVcauses more emissions
p20
aVthan all of transportation combined:
p21
aVcars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.
p22
aVAnd beef production uses 100 times the water
p23
aVthat most vegetables do.
p24
aa(lp25
VI also knew that I'm not alone.
p26
aVWe as a society
p27
aVare eating twice as much meat
p28
aVas we did in the 50s.
p29
aVSo what was once the special little side treat
p30
aVnow is the main, much more regular.
p31
aVSo really, any of these angles
p32
aVshould have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.
p33
aVYet, there I was \u2014 chk, chk, chk \u2014
p34
aVtucking into a big old steak.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo why was I stalling?
p37
aVI realized that what I was being pitched
p38
aVwas a binary solution.
p39
aVIt was either
p40
aVyou're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,
p41
aVand I guess I just wasn't quite ready.
p42
aVImagine your last hamburger.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVSo my common sense,
p45
aVmy good intentions,
p46
aVwere in conflict with my taste buds.
p47
aVAnd I'd commit to doing it later,
p48
aVand not surprisingly, later never came.
p49
aVSound familiar?
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I wondered,
p52
aVmight there be a third solution?
p53
aVAnd I thought about it, and I came up with one.
p54
aVI've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.
p55
aVIt's called weekday veg.
p56
aVThe name says it all:
p57
aVNothing with a face Monday through Friday.
p58
aVOn the weekend, your choice.
p59
aVSimple.
p60
aVIf you want to take it to the next level,
p61
aVremember, the major culprits
p62
aVin terms of environmental damage and health
p63
aVare red and processed meats.
p64
aVSo you want to swap those out
p65
aVwith some good, sustainably harvested fish.
p66
aVIt's structured,
p67
aVso it ends up being simple to remember,
p68
aVand it's okay to break it here and there.
p69
aVAfter all, cutting five days a week
p70
aVis cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe program has been great, weekday veg.
p73
aVMy footprint's smaller,
p74
aVI'm lessening pollution,
p75
aVI feel better about the animals,
p76
aVI'm even saving money.
p77
aVBest of all, I'm healthier,
p78
aVI know that I'm going to live longer,
p79
aVand I've even lost a little weight.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, please ask yourselves,
p82
aVfor your health,
p83
aVfor your pocketbook,
p84
aVfor the environment, for the animals:
p85
aVWhat's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?
p86
aVAfter all, if all of us
p87
aVate half as much meat,
p88
aVit would be like half of us
p89
aVwere vegetarians.
p90
aa(lp91
VThank you.
