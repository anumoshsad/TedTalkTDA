VThe year is 1800.
p4
aVA curious little invention is being talked about.
p5
aVIt's called a microscope.
p6
aVWhat it allows you to do
p7
aVis see tiny little lifeforms
p8
aVthat are invisible to the naked eye.
p9
aVSoon comes the medical discovery
p10
aVthat many of these lifeforms are actually causes
p11
aVof terrible human diseases.
p12
aVImagine what happened to the society
p13
aVwhen they realized
p14
aVthat an English mom in her teacup
p15
aVactually was drinking a monster soup,
p16
aVnot very far from here. This is from London.
p17
aa(lp18
VFast forward 200 years.
p19
aVWe still have this monster soup around,
p20
aVand it's taken hold in the developing countries
p21
aVaround the tropical belt.
p22
aVJust for malaria itself,
p23
aVthere are a million deaths a year,
p24
aVand more than a billion people
p25
aVthat need to be tested because they are at risk
p26
aVfor different species of malarial infections.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow it's actually very simple to put a face
p29
aVto many of these monsters.
p30
aVYou take a stain, like acridine orange
p31
aVor a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,
p32
aVand a microscope, and you look at them.
p33
aVThey all have faces.
p34
aVWhy is that so, that Alex in Kenya,
p35
aVFatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,
p36
aVand Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months
p37
aVto be able to diagnose why they are sick?
p38
aVAnd that's primarily because scalability
p39
aVof the diagnostics is completely out of reach.
p40
aVAnd remember that number: one billion.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe problem lies with the microscope itself.
p43
aVEven though the pinnacle of modern science,
p44
aVresearch microscopes are not designed for field testing.
p45
aVNeither were they first designed
p46
aVfor diagnostics at all.
p47
aVThey are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,
p48
aVand cost a lot of money.
p49
aVThis picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s
p50
aVusing the exact same setup that we actually use today
p51
aVfor diagnosing T.B. in his ashram
p52
aVin Sevagram in India.
p53
aa(lp54
VTwo of my students, Jim and James,
p55
aVtraveled around India and Thailand,
p56
aVstarting to think about this problem a lot.
p57
aVWe saw all kinds of donated equipment.
p58
aVWe saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.
p59
aVAnd we saw people who had a functional microscope
p60
aVbut just didn't know how to even turn it on.
p61
aVWhat grew out of that work and that trip
p62
aVwas actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what is a Foldscope?
p65
aVA Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,
p66
aVa platform for fluorescence, bright-field,
p67
aVpolarization, projection,
p68
aVall kinds of advanced microscopy
p69
aVbuilt purely by folding paper.
p70
aVSo, now you think, how is that possible?
p71
aVI'm going to show you some examples here,
p72
aVand we will run through some of them.
p73
aVIt starts with a single sheet of paper.
p74
aVWhat you see here is all the possible components
p75
aVto build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope.
p76
aVSo, there are three stages:
p77
aVThere is the optical stage, the illumination stage
p78
aVand the mask-holding stage.
p79
aVAnd there are micro optics at the bottom
p80
aVthat's actually embedded in the paper itself.
p81
aVWhat you do is, you take it on,
p82
aVand just like you are playing like a toy,
p83
aVwhich it is,
p84
aVI tab it off,
p85
aVand I break it off.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis paper has no instructions and no languages.
p88
aVThere is a code, a color code embedded,
p89
aVthat tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope.
p90
aVWhen it's done, it looks something like this,
p91
aVhas all the functionalities of a standard microscope,
p92
aVjust like an XY stage,
p93
aVa place where a sample slide could go,
p94
aVfor example right here.
p95
aVWe didn't want to change this,
p96
aVbecause this is the standard
p97
aVthat's been optimized for over the years,
p98
aVand many health workers are actually used to this.
p99
aVSo this is what changes,
p100
aVbut the standard stains all remain the same
p101
aVfor many different diseases.
p102
aVYou pop this in.
p103
aVThere is an XY stage,
p104
aVand then there is a focusing stage,
p105
aVwhich is a flexure mechanism
p106
aVthat's built in paper itself that allows us to move
p107
aVand focus the lenses by micron steps.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo what's really interesting about this object,
p110
aVand my students hate when I do this,
p111
aVbut I'm going to do this anyway,
p112
aVis these are rugged devices.
p113
aVI can turn it on and throw it on the floor
p114
aVand really try to stomp on it.
p115
aVAnd they last, even though they're designed
p116
aVfrom a very flexible material, like paper.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnother fun fact is, this is what we actually
p119
aVsend out there as a standard diagnostic tool,
p120
aVbut here in this envelope
p121
aVI have 30 different foldscopes
p122
aVof different configurations all in a single folder.
p123
aVAnd I'm going to pick one randomly.
p124
aVThis one, it turns out, is actually designed
p125
aVspecifically for malaria,
p126
aVbecause it has the fluorescent filters built
p127
aVspecifically for diagnosing malaria.
p128
aVSo the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes
p129
aVcomes out of this.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo up till now, you didn't actually see
p132
aVwhat I would see from one of these setups.
p133
aVSo what I would like to do is,
p134
aVif we could dim the lights, please,
p135
aVit turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes.
p136
aVI have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn \u2014
p137
aVgo to the back of the wall \u2014
p138
aVand just project, and this way you will see
p139
aVexactly what I would see.
p140
aVWhat you're looking at \u2014
p141
aV(Applause) \u2014
p142
aVThis is a cross-section of a compound eye,
p143
aVand when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,
p144
aVI am going through the z-axis.
p145
aVYou actually see how the lenses are cut together
p146
aVin the cross-section pattern.
p147
aVAnother example, one of my favorite insects,
p148
aVI love to hate this one,
p149
aVis a mosquito,
p150
aVand you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.
p151
aVRight there.
p152
aVAll from the simple setup that I actually described.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo my wife has been field testing
p155
aVsome of our microscopes
p156
aVby washing my clothes whenever I forget them
p157
aVin the dryer.
p158
aVSo it turns out they're waterproof, and \u2014
p159
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p160
aVright here is just fluorescent water,
p161
aVand I don't know if you can actually see this.
p162
aVThis also shows you how  the projection scope works.
p163
aVYou get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent.
p164
aa(lp165
VCan we get the lights back on again?
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I'm quickly going to show you,
p168
aVsince I'm running out of time,
p169
aVin terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,
p170
aVthe biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,
p171
aVso we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.
p172
aV(Applause)
p173
aVAnd what this allows us to do
p174
aVis to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,
p175
aVwhich we call use-and-throw microscopy.
p176
aVI'm going to give you a quick snapshot
p177
aVof some of the parts that go in.
p178
aVHere is a sheet of paper.
p179
aVThis is when we were thinking about the idea.
p180
aVThis is an A4 sheet of paper.
p181
aVThese are the three stages that you actually see.
p182
aVAnd the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right,
p183
aVwe had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses
p184
aVin paper itself at really high throughputs,
p185
aVso it uses a process of self-assembly
p186
aVand surface tension
p187
aVto build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.
p188
aVSo that's where the lenses go.
p189
aVThere are some light sources.
p190
aVAnd essentially, in the end,
p191
aVall the parts line up because of origami,
p192
aVbecause of the fact that origami allows us
p193
aVmicron-scale precision of optical alignment.
p194
aVSo even though this looks like a simple toy,
p195
aVthe aspects of engineering that go in
p196
aVsomething like this are fairly sophisticated.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo here is another obvious thing that we would do,
p199
aVtypically, if I was going to show
p200
aVthat these microscopes are robust,
p201
aVis go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself.
p202
aVThere it is, and it survives.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo for us, the next step actually
p205
aVis really finishing our field trials.
p206
aVWe are starting at the end of the summer.
p207
aVWe are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes.
p208
aVThat would be the first time where we would be
p209
aVdoing field trials with the highest density
p210
aVof microscopes ever at a given place.
p211
aVWe've started collecting data for malaria,
p212
aVChagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd I want to leave you with this picture.
p215
aVI had not anticipated this before,
p216
aVbut a really interesting link
p217
aVbetween hands-on science education
p218
aVand global health.
p219
aVWhat are the tools that we're actually providing
p220
aVthe kids who are going to fight
p221
aVthis monster soup for tomorrow?
p222
aVI would love for them to be able to just print out
p223
aVa Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.
