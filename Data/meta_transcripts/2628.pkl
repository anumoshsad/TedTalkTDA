VI am so excited to be here.
p4
aVEverything in America is so much bigger than in Europe.
p5
aVLook at me \u2014 I am huge!
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VIt's fantastic!
p10
aVAnd TED Talks \u2014 TED Talks are where everybody has great ideas.
p11
aVSo the question is: Where do those great ideas come from?
p12
aVWell, it's a little bit of debate,
p13
aVbut it's generally reckoned that the average person \u2014
p14
aVthat's me \u2014
p15
aVhas about 50,000 thoughts a day.
p16
aVWhich is a lot,
p17
aVuntil you realize that 95 percent of them
p18
aVare the same ones you had the day before.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd a lot of mine are really boring, OK?
p23
aVI think things like,
p24
aV"Oh! I know \u2014 I must clean the floor.
p25
aVOh! I forgot to walk the dog."
p26
aVMy most popular:
p27
aV"Don't eat that cookie."
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, 95 percent repetition.
p32
aVThat leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day
p33
aVto actually think something new.
p34
aVAnd some of my new thoughts are useless.
p35
aVThe other day I was watching some sports on television,
p36
aVand I was trying to decide why I just don't engage with it.
p37
aVSome of it I find curious.
p38
aVThis is odd.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VDo you think it would be worth being that flexible
p43
aVjust to be able to see your heel at that angle?
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd here's the thing:
p48
aVI'm never going to be able to relate to that,
p49
aVbecause I'm never going to be able to do it, OK?
p50
aVWell, not twice, anyway.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VBut I'll tell you the truth.
p55
aVThe truth is I have never been any good at sport, OK?
p56
aVI've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say,
p57
aV"Oh, I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18."
p58
aVAnd I always feel rather smug then.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VI'm exactly as fit as I was when I \u2014
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VI couldn't run then. I'm certainly not going to do it now.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo then I had my new idea:
p73
aVWhy not engage people like me in sport?
p74
aVI think what the world needs now
p75
aVis the Olympics for people with zero athletic ability.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VOh, it would be so much more fun.
p80
aVWe'd have three basic rules, OK?
p81
aVObviously no drugs; no corruption, no skills.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VIt would be \u2014
p86
aVNo, it's a terrible idea.
p87
aVAnd I also know why I don't engage with sport when I watch it on television.
p88
aVIt's because probably 97 percent of it is about men running
p89
aVand men kicking things,
p90
aVmen trying to look neatly packaged in Lycra.
p91
aVThere is \u2014
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VNot always successfully.
p96
aVThere is \u2014
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VThere is so little female sport on television,
p101
aVthat a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking,
p102
aVand how can I put this nicely,
p103
aVthat the male member is the very lever you need
p104
aVto get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VThe inequalities in sport are breathtaking.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo this is what happens to me:
p111
aVI have a brand new idea,
p112
aVand immediately I come back to an old one.
p113
aVThe fact is, there is not now,
p114
aVnor has there ever been in the whole of history,
p115
aVa single country in the world where women have equality with men.
p116
aVNot one.
p117
aV196 countries,
p118
aVit hasn't happened in the whole of evolution.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, here is a picture of evolution.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VWe women are not even in it!
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VIt's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly.
p129
aVSo \u2014
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VIt bugs me, and I know I should do something about it.
p134
aVBut I'm busy, OK?
p135
aVI have a full-on career,
p136
aVI've got three kids, I've got an elderly mom.
p137
aVIn fact, if I'm honest with you,
p138
aVone of the reasons I came out here
p139
aVis because TED Talks said I could have 15 minutes to myself,
p140
aVand I never have that much time \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo I'm busy.
p147
aVAnd anyway, I already had a go at changing the world.
p148
aVHere's the thing, OK?
p149
aVEverybody has inside themselves what I call an "activation button."
p150
aVIt's the button that gets pressed when you think,
p151
aV"I must do something about this."
p152
aVIt gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.
p153
aVMaybe you face some kind of inequality,
p154
aVor you've come across an injustice of some kind,
p155
aVsometimes an illness strikes,
p156
aVor you're born in some way disadvantaged,
p157
aVor perhaps underprivileged.
p158
aVSo I was born gay, OK?
p159
aVI've always known,
p160
aVI don't think my family were the least bit surprised.
p161
aVHere is a picture of me aged four.
p162
aVI look cute,
p163
aVbut inside I genuinely believed that I looked like Clint Eastwood.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VSo my activation button was pressed when I had my kids \u2014
p168
aVthree wonderful kids, born to my then-partner.
p169
aVNow here's the thing: I work on television in Britain.
p170
aVBy the time they were born, I was already hosting my own shows
p171
aVand working in the public eye.
p172
aVI love what I do,
p173
aVbut I love my kids more.
p174
aVAnd I didn't want them to grow up with a secret.
p175
aV1994, when my son, my youngest was born,
p176
aVthere was not, as far as I was aware,
p177
aVa single out, gay woman in British public life.
p178
aVI don't think secrets are a good thing.
p179
aVI think they are a cancer of the soul.
p180
aVSo I decided to come out.
p181
aa(lp182
VEverybody warned me that I would never work again,
p183
aVbut I decided it was absolutely worth the risk.
p184
aVWell, it was hell.
p185
aVIn Britain, we have a particularly vicious section of the right-wing press,
p186
aVand they went nuts.
p187
aVAnd their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society,
p188
aVand we got death threats \u2014
p189
aVenough death threats that I had to take the kids into hiding,
p190
aVand we had to have police protection.
p191
aVAnd I promise you there were many moments in the still of the night
p192
aVwhen I was terrified by what I had done.
p193
aa(lp194
VEventually the dust settled.
p195
aVAgainst all expectation I carried on working,
p196
aVand my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic.
p197
aVI remember when my son was six, he had a friend over to play.
p198
aVThey were in the next room; I could hear them chatting.
p199
aVThe friend said to my son, "What's it like having two mums?"
p200
aVI was a little anxious to hear, so I leant in to hear and my son said,
p201
aV"It's fantastic, because if one of them's sick,
p202
aVyou've still got another one to cook for you."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VSo my activation button for gay equality was pressed,
p207
aVand along with many, many others,
p208
aVI campaigned for years for gay rights,
p209
aVand in particular, the right to marry the person that I love.
p210
aVIn the end, we succeeded.
p211
aVAnd in 2014, on the day that the law was changed,
p212
aVI married my wife, who I love very much, indeed.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VWe didn't do it in a quiet way \u2014 we did it on the stage
p217
aVat the Royal Festival Hall in London.
p218
aVIt was a great event.
p219
aVThe hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people.
p220
aVWe invited 150 family and friends, then I let it be known to the public:
p221
aVanybody who wanted to come and celebrate, please come and join us.
p222
aVIt would be free to anybody who wanted to come.
p223
aVTwo-and-half thousand people turned up.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VEvery kind of person you can imagine:
p228
aVgays, straights, rabbis, nuns, married people,
p229
aVblack, white \u2014 the whole of humanity was there.
p230
aVAnd I remember standing on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.
p231
aVJob done.
p232
aVLove triumphs.
p233
aVLaw changed."
p234
aVAnd I \u2014
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd I genuinely thought my activation days were over, OK?
p239
aVSo every year in that same hall,
p240
aVI host a fantastic concert to celebrate International Women's Day.
p241
aVWe gather the world's only all-female orchestra,
p242
aVwe play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers,
p243
aVwe have amazing conductors \u2014
p244
aVit's Marin Alsop there from Baltimore conducting,
p245
aVPetula Clark singing \u2014
p246
aVand I give a lecture on women's history.
p247
aVI love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on.
p248
aVToo often, I think history's what I call the Mount Rushmore model.
p249
aVIt looks majestic, but the women have been entirely left out of it.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd I was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes \u2014
p252
aVI'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard
p253
aVfor the right for women in Britain to vote.
p254
aVAnd their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."
p255
aVAnd boy, they succeeded,
p256
aVbecause women did indeed get the vote in 1928.
p257
aVSo I'm giving this talk about this,
p258
aVand as I'm talking, what I realized is:
p259
aVthis was not a history lecture I was giving;
p260
aVthis was not something where the job was done.
p261
aVThis was something where there was so much left to do.
p262
aVNowhere in the world, for example,
p263
aVdo women have equal representation in positions of power.
p264
aa(lp265
VOK, let's take a very quick look at the top 100 companies
p266
aVin the London Stock Exchange in 2016.
p267
aVTop 100 companies: How many women running them?
p268
aVSeven. OK. Seven. That's all right, I suppose.
p269
aVUntil you realize that 17 are run by men called "John."
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VThere are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies \u2014
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
Vthan there are women.
p278
aVThere are 14 run by men called "Dave."
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, I'm sure Dave and John are doing a bang-up job.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VOK. Why does it matter?
p287
aVWell, it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap.
p288
aVNowhere in the world do women earn the same as men.
p289
aVAnd that is never going to change
p290
aVunless we have more women at the top in the boardroom.
p291
aVWe have plenty of laws;
p292
aVthe Equal Pay Act in Britain was passed in 1975.
p293
aVNevertheless, there are still many, many women
p294
aVwho, from early November until the end of the year,
p295
aVby comparison to their male colleagues,
p296
aVare effectively working for free.
p297
aVIn fact, the World Economic Forum estimates
p298
aVthat women will finally get equal pay in ...
p299
aV2133!
p300
aVYay!
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VThat's a terrible figure.
p305
aVAnd here's the thing:
p306
aVthe day before I came out to give my talk,
p307
aVthe World Economic Forum revised it.
p308
aVSo that's good, because that's a terrible \u2014 2133.
p309
aVDo you know what they revised it to?
p310
aV2186.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VYeah, another 53 years, OK?
p315
aVWe are not going to get equal pay
p316
aVin my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives
p317
aVunder the current system.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd I have waited long enough.
p320
aVI've waited long enough in my own business.
p321
aVIn 2016 I became the very first woman on British television
p322
aVto host a prime-time panel show.
p323
aVIsn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.
p324
aVBut \u2014
p325
aa(lp326
V(Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VBut 2016! The first!
p329
aVTelevision's been around for 80 years!
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VIt may be television's not so important,
p334
aVbut it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?
p335
aV2016, the UN were looking for a brand new ambassador
p336
aVto represent women's empowerment and gender equality,
p337
aVand who did they choose?
p338
aVWonder Woman.
p339
aVYes, they chose a cartoon, OK?
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VBecause no woman was up to the job.
p344
aa(lp345
VThe representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low.
p346
aVIt's true in Congress, and it's certainly true in the British Parliament.
p347
aVIn 2015, the number of men elected to the Parliament that year
p348
aVwas greater than the total number of women
p349
aVwho have ever been members of Parliament.
p350
aVAnd why does it matter?
p351
aVHere's the thing: if they're not at the table \u2014
p352
aVliterally, in Britain, at that table helping to make the laws \u2014
p353
aVdo not be surprised if the female perspective is overlooked.
p354
aa(lp355
VIt's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge.
p356
aVIn 2016, Britain got its second female Prime Minister;
p357
aVTheresa May came to power.
p358
aVThe day she came to power she was challenged:
p359
aVjust do one thing.
p360
aVDo one thing in the first 100 days that you're in office
p361
aVto try and improve lives for women in Britain.
p362
aVAnd what did she do? Nothing.
p363
aVNothing.
p364
aVBecause she's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made.
p365
aVEven having a female leader,
p366
aVthey always find something better to do
p367
aVthan to sort out the pesky issue of inequality.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo I keep talking about equality like it matters. Does it?
p370
aVWell, let's take a very quick look at the STEM industries, OK?
p371
aVSo science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
p372
aVPretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives.
p373
aVThere is the thickest and most incredibly well-documented glass ceiling
p374
aVin the STEM industries.
p375
aVWhat if the cure for cancer
p376
aVor the answer the global warming
p377
aVlies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress?
p378
aa(lp379
VSo I thought all these things,
p380
aVand I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."
p381
aVAnd I spoke to my wonderful friend,
p382
aVbrilliant journalist Catherine Mayer in Britain,
p383
aVand we rather foolishly \u2014
p384
aVand I suspect there was wine involved \u2014
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VWe decided to found a brand new political party.
p389
aVBecause here's the critical thing:
p390
aVthe one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.
p391
aVWe had no idea what we were doing,
p392
aVwe didn't know how complicated it was to start a political party.
p393
aVI thought, "It can't be that difficult, men have been doing it for years."
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VSo we started by calling it "The Women's Equality Party."
p398
aVAnd straightaway people said to me,
p399
aV"Why did you call it that?"
p400
aVI said, "I don't know, I just thought we'd be clear."
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VI didn't want what we were doing to be a secret, you know? I just \u2014
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VSome people said, "You can't call it that! It's much too feminist!"
p409
aVOoh! Scary word! Ahh!
p410
aVI can't tell you how many times I've heard somebody say,
p411
aV"I'm not a feminist, but ..."
p412
aVAnd I always think if there's a "but" in the sentence,
p413
aVit can't all be roses in the garden.
p414
aVAnd then I started getting asked the hilarious question,
p415
aV"Are you all going to burn your bras?"
p416
aVYes! Because bras are famously made of flammable material.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VThat's why all women spark when they walk.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VHere's quick history sidebar for you:
p425
aVno woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.
p426
aVIt's a story made up by a journalist.
p427
aVThank goodness journalism has improved since then.
p428
aVSo \u2014
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VI announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview,
p433
aVand straightaway, the emails started coming.
p434
aVFirst hundreds, then thousands and thousands,
p435
aVfrom every age group: from the very young to women in their '90s,
p436
aVto hundreds of wonderful men.
p437
aVPeople wrote and said, "Please, can I help?
p438
aVPlease, can I visit you at party headquarters?"
p439
aVWe didn't have a headquarters \u2014 we didn't have a party!
p440
aVWe didn't have anything.
p441
aVAll we had was a wonderful, tight group of fabulous friends
p442
aVtrying to answer emails pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.
p443
aa(lp444
VWe were all busy.
p445
aVMany of us had careers, many of us had children,
p446
aVbut we did what women do, and we shared the work.
p447
aVAnd almost instantly, we agreed on certain fundamental things.
p448
aVFirst thing: we want to be the only political party in the world
p449
aVwhose main aim was to no longer need to exist.
p450
aVThat's a fantastic idea.
p451
aVWe wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning.
p452
aVWe wanted people from the left, from the right, from the middle,
p453
aVevery age group.
p454
aVBecause the whole point was to work with a simple agenda:
p455
aVlet's get equality in every aspect of our lives,
p456
aVand when we're finished,
p457
aVlet's go home and get the other chores done.
p458
aa(lp459
V(Laughter)
p460
aa(lp461
VAnd we wanted to change how politics is conducted.
p462
aVI don't know if you have this,
p463
aVbut in Britain we have two major political parties.
p464
aVThey're the dinosaurs of politics.
p465
aVAnd how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous.
p466
aVI'm sure you've never had that kind of name-calling \u2014
p467
aa(lp468
V(Laughter)
p469
aa(lp470
VAnd lying here.
p471
aVWouldn't it be great if just one politician said,
p472
aV"Do you know, my opponent has a point.
p473
aVLet's see if we can't work together and get the job done."
p474
aa(lp475
V(Applause)
p476
aa(lp477
VAnd let's get more women into politics, OK?
p478
aVLet's immediately get more women into politics
p479
aVby being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates,
p480
aVso they can get out of the house and start campaigning.
p481
aa(lp482
V(Applause)
p483
aa(lp484
VWithin 10 months,
p485
aVwe had more than 70 branches of our party across the UK.
p486
