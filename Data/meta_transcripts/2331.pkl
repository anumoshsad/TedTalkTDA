VA question I'm often asked is,
p4
aVwhere did I get my passion for human rights and justice?
p5
aVIt started early.
p6
aVI grew up in the west of Ireland,
p7
aVwedged between four brothers,
p8
aVtwo older than me and two younger than me.
p9
aVSo of course I had to be interested in human rights,
p10
aVand equality and justice,
p11
aVand using my elbows!
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd those issues stayed with me and guided me,
p16
aVand in particular,
p17
aVwhen I was elected the first woman President of Ireland,
p18
aVfrom 1990 to 1997.
p19
aVI dedicated my presidency
p20
aVto having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland,
p21
aVand bringing together communities from Northern Ireland
p22
aVwith those from the Republic,
p23
aVtrying to build peace.
p24
aVAnd I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom
p25
aVand met with Queen Elizabeth II,
p26
aVand also welcomed to my official residence \u2014
p27
aVwhich we call "Áras an Uachtaráin," the house of the president \u2014
p28
aVmembers of the royal family,
p29
aVincluding, notably, the Prince of Wales.
p30
aVAnd I was aware that at the time of my presidency,
p31
aVIreland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress.
p32
aVWe were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union.
p33
aVIndeed, when Ireland first joined the European Union in 1973,
p34
aVthere were parts of the country that were considered developing,
p35
aVincluding my own beloved native county, County Mayo.
p36
aVI led trade delegations here to the United States,
p37
aVto Japan, to India,
p38
aVto encourage investment, to help to create jobs,
p39
aVto build up our economy,
p40
aVto build up our health system, our education \u2014
p41
aVour development.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhat I didn't have to do as president
p44
aVwas buy land on mainland Europe,
p45
aVso that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater.
p46
aVWhat I didn't have to think about,
p47
aVeither as president or as a constitutional lawyer,
p48
aVwas the implications for the sovereignty of the territory
p49
aVbecause of the impact of climate change.
p50
aVBut that is what President Tong, of the Republic of Kiribati,
p51
aVhas to wake up every morning thinking about.
p52
aVHe has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy,
p53
aVwhat he calls, "migration with dignity,"
p54
aVbecause he knows that his people may have to leave their islands.
p55
aVAs I listened to President Tong describing the situation,
p56
aVI really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face.
p57
aVAnd as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems,
p58
aVI thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.
p59
aVI thought about her and those who worked with her
p60
aVon the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948,
p61
aVand drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
p62
aVFor them, it would have been unimaginable
p63
aVthat a whole country could go out of existence
p64
aVbecause of human-induced climate change.
p65
aa(lp66
VI came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer,
p67
aVand I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears
p68
aVor melting glaciers.
p69
aVIt was because of the impact on people,
p70
aVand the impact on their rights \u2014
p71
aVtheir rights to food and safe water, health, education and shelter.
p72
aVAnd I say this with humility,
p73
aVbecause I came late to the issue of climate change.
p74
aVWhen I served
p75
aVas UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
p76
aVfrom 1997 to 2002,
p77
aVclimate change wasn't at the front of my mind.
p78
aVI don't remember making a single speech on climate change.
p79
aVI knew that there was another part of the United Nations \u2014
p80
aVthe UN Convention on Climate Change \u2014
p81
aVthat was dealing with the issue of climate change.
p82
aVIt was later when I started to work in African countries
p83
aVon issues of development and human rights.
p84
aVAnd I kept hearing this pervasive sentence:
p85
aV"Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse."
p86
aVAnd then I explored what was behind that;
p87
aVit was about changes in the climate \u2014
p88
aVclimate shocks, changes in the weather.
p89
aa(lp90
VI met Constance Okollet,
p91
aVwho had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda,
p92
aVand she told me that when she was growing up,
p93
aVshe had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry,
p94
aVthey knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come,
p95
aVthey knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest,
p96
aVand so they had enough food.
p97
aVBut, in recent years,
p98
aVat the time of this conversation,
p99
aVthey had nothing but long periods of drought,
p100
aVand then flash flooding,
p101
aVand then more drought.
p102
aVThe school had been destroyed,
p103
aVlivelihoods had been destroyed,
p104
aVtheir harvest had been destroyed.
p105
aVShe forms this women's group to try to keep her community together.
p106
aVAnd this was a reality that really struck me,
p107
aVbecause of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible
p108
aVfor the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem.
p109
aa(lp110
VIndeed, I was very struck about the situation in Malawi
p111
aVin January of this year.
p112
aVThere was an unprecedented flooding in the country,
p113
aVit covered about a third of the country,
p114
aVover 300 people were killed,
p115
aVand hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods.
p116
aVAnd the average person in Malawi
p117
aVemits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.
p118
aVThe average US citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons.
p119
aVSo those who are suffering disproportionately
p120
aVdon't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly,
p121
aVand yet they are feeling more and more
p122
aVthe impacts of the changes in the climate,
p123
aVthe changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly,
p124
aVand knowing how to look after their future.
p125
aVI think it was really the importance of the injustice
p126
aVthat really struck me very forcibly.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice
p129
aVbecause we're not on course for a safe world.
p130
aVGovernments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen,
p131
aVand have repeated it at every conference on climate,
p132
aVthat we have to stay below two degrees Celsius
p133
aVof warming above pre-Industrial standards.
p134
aVBut we're on course for about four degrees.
p135
aVSo we face an existential threat to the future of our planet.
p136
aVAnd that made me realize
p137
aVthat climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd that brought me then to climate justice.
p140
aVClimate justice responds to the moral argument \u2014
p141
aVboth sides of the moral argument \u2014
p142
aVto address climate change.
p143
aVFirst of all,
p144
aVto be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected.
p145
aVAnd secondly,
p146
aVto make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move
p147
aVand start to address climate change with climate action,
p148
aVas we are doing.
p149
aa(lp150
VIn our very unequal world today,
p151
aVit's very striking how many people are left behind.
p152
aVIn our world of 7.2 billion people, about 3 billion are left behind.
p153
aV1.3 billion don't have access to electricity,
p154
aVand they light their homes with kerosene and candles,
p155
aVboth of which are dangerous.
p156
aVAnd in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting.
p157
aV2.6 billion people cook on open fires \u2014
p158
aVon coal, wood and animal dung.
p159
aVAnd this causes about 4 million deaths a year
p160
aVfrom indoor smoke inhalation,
p161
aVand of course, most of those who die are women.
p162
aVSo we have a very unequal world,
p163
aVand we need to change from "business as usual."
p164
aVAnd we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature
p165
aVof the change which will be needed,
p166
aVbecause we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050,
p167
aVif we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming.
p168
aVAnd that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources
p169
aVof fossil fuels in the ground.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt's a very big change,
p172
aVand it means that obviously,
p173
aVindustrialized countries must cut their emissions,
p174
aVmust become much more energy-efficient,
p175
aVand must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy.
p176
aVFor developing countries and emerging economies,
p177
aVthe problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions,
p178
aVbecause they must develop; they have very poor populations.
p179
aVSo they must develop without emissions, and that is a different kind of problem.
p180
aVIndeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions.
p181
aVAll the countries have developed with fossil fuels,
p182
aVand then may be moving to renewable energy.
p183
aVSo it is a very big challenge,
p184
aVand it requires the total support of the international community,
p185
aVwith the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support,
p186
aVbecause no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change.
p187
aVThis is an issue that requires complete human solidarity.
p188
aVHuman solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest \u2014
p189
aVbecause we are all in this together,
p190
aVand we have to work together
p191
aVto ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe good news is that change is happening,
p194
aVand it's happening very fast.
p195
aVHere in California,
p196
aVthere's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions.
p197
aVIn Hawaii, they're passing legislation
p198
aVto have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.
p199
aVAnd governments are very ambitious around the world.
p200
aVIn Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021.
p201
aVIn Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.
p202
aVApple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy.
p203
aVAnd there is a race on at the moment
p204
aVto convert electricity from tidal and wave power,
p205
aVin order that we can leave the coal in the ground.
p206
aVAnd that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly.
p207
aVBut it's still not enough,
p208
aVand the political will is still not enough.
p209
aa(lp210
VLet me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati.
p211
aVThey actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution,
p212
aVbut it would take a lot of political will.
p213
aVPresident Tong told me about his ambitious idea
p214
aVto either build up or even float the little islands where his people live.
p215
aVThis, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself.
p216
aVIt would require great solidarity and support from other countries,
p217
aVand it would require the kind of imaginative idea
p218
aVthat we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air.
p219
aVBut wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder
p220
aVand to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory,
p221
aVand be part of the community of nations?
p222
aVThat is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about.
p223
aVYes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big,
p224
aVbut they can be solved.
p225
aVWe are actually, as a people,
p226
aVvery capable of coming together to solve problems.
p227
aa(lp228
VI was very conscious of this as I took part this year
p229
aVin commemoration of the 70th anniversary
p230
aVof the end of the Second World War in 1945.
p231
aV1945 was an extraordinary year.
p232
aVIt was a year when the world faced
p233
aVwhat must have seemed almost insoluble problems \u2014
p234
aVthe devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War;
p235
aVthe fragile peace that had been brought about;
p236
aVthe need for a whole economic regeneration.
p237
aVBut the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this.
p238
aVThey had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by
p239
aVnever again must the world have this kind of problem.
p240
aVAnd they had to build structures for peace and security.
p241
aVAnd what did we get? What did they achieve?
p242
aVThe Charter of the United Nations,
p243
aVthe Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank,
p244
aVand the International Monetary Fund.
p245
aVA Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe,
p246
aVto reconstruct it.
p247
aVAnd indeed a few years later,
p248
aVthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
p249
aa(lp250
V2015 is a year that is similar in its importance
p251
aVto 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential.
p252
aVThere will be two big summits this year:
p253
aVthe first one, in September in New York,
p254
aVis the summit for the sustainable development goals.
p255
aVAnd then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement.
p256
aVThe sustainable development goals are intended to help countries
p257
aVto live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth,
p258
aVnot to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems,
p259
aVbut rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth,
p260
aVby living under sustainable development.
p261
aVAnd the sustainable development goals
p262
aVwill come into operation for all countries
p263
aVon January 1, 2016.
p264
aVThe climate agreement \u2014
p265
aVa binding climate agreement \u2014
p266
aVis needed because of the scientific evidence
p267
aVthat we're on a trajectory for about a four-degree world
p268
aVand we have to change course to stay below two degrees.
p269
aVSo we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed,
p270
aVso that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions,
p271
aVand how we move more rapidly to renewable energy,
p272
aVso that we have a safe world.
p273
aa(lp274
VThe reality is that this issue is much too important
p275
aVto be left to politicians and to the United Nations.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VIt's an issue for all of us,
p280
aVand it's an issue where we need more and more momentum.
p281
aVIndeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed,
p282
aVbecause of the justice dimension.
p283
aVIt's now an issue for faith-based organizations,
p284
aVunder very good leadership from Pope Francis,
p285
aVand indeed, the Church of England,
p286
aVwhich is divesting from fossil fuels.
p287
aVIt's an issue for the business community,
p288
aVand the good news is
p289
aVthat the business community is changing very rapidly \u2014
p290
aVexcept for the fossil fuel industries \u2014
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VEven they are beginning to slightly change their language \u2014
p295
aVbut only slightly.
p296
aVBut business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy,
p297
aVbut is urging politicians to give them more signals,
p298
aVso that they can move even more rapidly.
p299
aVIt's an issue for the trade union movement.
p300
aVIt's an issue for the women's movement.
p301
aVIt's an issue for young people.
p302
aa(lp303
VI was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan,
p304
aVone of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,
p305
aVsaid quite recently that
p306
aVclimate change is the lunch counter moment for young people.
p307
aVSo, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century \u2014
p308
aVthe sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century,
p309
aVbecause he said it is the greatest challenge
p310
aVto humanity and justice in our world.
p311
aa(lp312
VI recall very much the Climate March last September,
p313
aVand that was a huge momentum,
p314
aVnot just in New York, but all around the world.
p315
aVand we have to build on that.
p316
aVI was marching with some of The Elders family,
p317
aVand I saw a placard a little bit away from me,
p318
aVbut we were wedged so closely together \u2014
p319
aVbecause after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York \u2014
p320
aVso I couldn't quite get to that placard,
p321
aVI would have just liked to have been able to step behind it,
p322
aVbecause it said, "Angry Grannies!"
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VThat's what I felt.
p327
aVAnd I have five grandchildren now,
p328
aVI feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren,
p329
aVand I think about their world,
p330
aVand what it will be like when they will share that world
p331
aVwith about 9 billion other people in 2050.
p332
aVWe know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world,
p333
aVbecause of the emissions we've already put up there,
p334
aVbut it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer,
p335
aVand much better for health, and better for jobs
p336
aVand better for energy security,
p337
aVthan the world we have now,
p338
aVif we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy,
p339
aVand no one is left behind.
p340
aVNo one is left behind.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd just as we've been looking back this year \u2014
p343
aVin 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years \u2014
p344
aVI would like to think that they will look back,
p345
aVthat world will look back 35 years from 2050,
p346
aV35 years to 2015,
p347
aVand that they will say,
p348
aV"Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015?
p349
aVWe really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference,
p350
aVand that put the world on the right pathway,
p351
aVand we benefit now from that pathway,"
p352
aVthat they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities,
p353
aVwe did what was done in 1945 in similar terms,
p354
aVwe didn't miss the opportunity,
p355
aVwe lived up to our responsibilities.
p356
aVThat's what this year is about.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd somehow for me,
p359
aVit's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much.
p360
aVShe was a mentor of mine, she was a friend,
p361
aVshe died much too young,
p362
aVshe was an extraordinary personality,
p363
aVa great champion of the environment:
p364
aVWangari Maathai.
p365
aVWangari said once,
p366
aV"In the course of history,
p367
aVthere comes a time when humanity is called upon
p368
aVto shift to a new level of consciousness,
p369
aVto reach a higher moral ground."
p370
aVAnd that's what we have to do.
p371
aVWe have to reach a new level of consciousness,
p372
aVa higher moral ground.
p373
aVAnd we have to do it this year in those two big summits.
p374
aVAnd that won't happen unless we have the momentum
p375
aVfrom people around the world who say:
p376
aV"We want action now,
p377
aVwe want to change course,
p378
aVwe want a safe world,
p379
aVa safe world for future generations,
p380
aVa safe world for our children and our grandchildren,
p381
aVand we're all in this together."
