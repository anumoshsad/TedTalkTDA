VOn November 5th, 1990,
p4
aVa man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked
p5
aVinto a hotel in Manhattan
p6
aVand assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,
p7
aVthe leader of the Jewish Defense League.
p8
aVNosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,
p9
aVbut while serving time on lesser charges,
p10
aVhe and other men began planning attacks
p11
aVon a dozen New York City landmarks,
p12
aVincluding tunnels, synagogues
p13
aVand the United Nations headquarters.
p14
aVThankfully, those plans were foiled
p15
aVby an FBI informant.
p16
aVSadly, the 1993 bombing
p17
aVof the World Trade Center was not.
p18
aVNosair would eventually be convicted
p19
aVfor his involvement in the plot.
p20
aVEl-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
p21
aa(lp22
VI was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
p23
aVin 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,
p24
aVand a loving American mother and grade school teacher,
p25
aVwho together tried their best
p26
aVto create a happy childhood for me.
p27
aVIt wasn't until I was seven years old
p28
aVthat our family dynamic started to change.
p29
aVMy father exposed me to a side of Islam
p30
aVthat few people, including the majority of Muslims,
p31
aVget to see.
p32
aVIt's been my experience that when people
p33
aVtake the time to interact with one another,
p34
aVit doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,
p35
aVwe all want the same things out of life.
p36
aVHowever, in every religion, in every population,
p37
aVyou'll find a small percentage of people
p38
aVwho hold so fervently to their beliefs
p39
aVthat they feel they must use any means necessary
p40
aVto make others live as they do.
p41
aa(lp42
VA few months prior to his arrest,
p43
aVhe sat me down and explained that
p44
aVfor the past few weekends, he and some friends
p45
aVhad been going to a shooting range on Long Island
p46
aVfor target practice.
p47
aVHe told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
p48
aVWe arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,
p49
aVwhich unbeknownst to our group was being watched
p50
aVby the FBI.
p51
aVWhen it was my turn to shoot,
p52
aVmy father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder
p53
aVand explained how to aim at the target
p54
aVabout 30 yards off.
p55
aVThat day, the last bullet I shot
p56
aVhit the small orange light that sat on top of the target
p57
aVand to everyone's surprise, especially mine,
p58
aVthe entire target burst into flames.
p59
aVMy uncle turned to the other men,
p60
aVand in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."
p61
aVLike father, like son.
p62
aVThey all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment,
p63
aVbut it wasn't until a few years later
p64
aVthat I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
p65
aVThey thought they saw in me the same destruction
p66
aVmy father was capable of.
p67
aVThose men would eventually be convicted
p68
aVof placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives
p69
aVinto the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower,
p70
aVcausing an explosion that killed six people
p71
aVand injured over 1,000 others.
p72
aVThese were the men I looked up to.
p73
aVThese were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
p74
aa(lp75
VBy the time I turned 19,
p76
aVI had already moved 20 times in my life,
p77
aVand that instability during my childhood
p78
aVdidn't really provide an opportunity
p79
aVto make many friends.
p80
aVEach time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone,
p81
aVit was time to pack up and move to the next town.
p82
aVBeing the perpetual new face in class,
p83
aVI was frequently the target of bullies.
p84
aVI kept my identity a secret from my classmates
p85
aVto avoid being targeted,
p86
aVbut as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class
p87
aVwas more than enough ammunition.
p88
aVSo for the most part, I spent my time at home
p89
aVreading books and watching TV
p90
aVor playing video games.
p91
aVFor those reasons, my social skills were lacking,
p92
aVto say the least,
p93
aVand growing up in a bigoted household,
p94
aVI wasn't prepared for the real world.
p95
aVI'd been raised to judge people
p96
aVbased on arbitrary measurements,
p97
aVlike a person's race or religion.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo what opened my eyes?
p100
aVOne of my first experiences
p101
aVthat challenged this way of thinking
p102
aVwas during the 2000 presidential elections.
p103
aVThrough a college prep program,
p104
aVI was able to take part
p105
aVin the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
p106
aVMy particular group's focus was on youth violence,
p107
aVand having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,
p108
aVthis was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.
p109
aVThe members of our group came from many different walks of life.
p110
aVOne day toward the end of the convention,
p111
aVI found out that one of the kids I had befriended
p112
aVwas Jewish.
p113
aVNow, it had taken several days
p114
aVfor this detail to come to light,
p115
aVand I realized that there was no natural animosity
p116
aVbetween the two of us.
p117
aVI had never had a Jewish friend before,
p118
aVand frankly I felt a sense of pride
p119
aVin having been able to overcome a barrier
p120
aVthat for most of my life I had been led to believe
p121
aVwas insurmountable.
p122
aVAnother major turning point came when
p123
aVI found a summer job at Busch Gardens,
p124
aVan amusement park.
p125
aVThere, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,
p126
aVand that experience proved to be fundamental
p127
aVto the development of my character.
p128
aVMost of my life, I'd been taught
p129
aVthat homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,
p130
aVthat all gay people were a negative influence.
p131
aVAs chance would have it, I had the opportunity
p132
aVto work with some of the gay performers
p133
aVat a show there,
p134
aVand soon found that many were the kindest,
p135
aVleast judgmental people I had ever met.
p136
aVBeing bullied as a kid
p137
aVcreated a sense of empathy in me
p138
aVtoward the suffering of others,
p139
aVand it comes very unnaturally to me
p140
aVto treat people who are kind
p141
aVin any other way than how I would want to be treated.
p142
aVBecause of that feeling, I was able
p143
aVto contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child
p144
aVwith real life experience and interaction.
p145
aVI don't know what it's like to be gay,
p146
aVbut I'm well acquainted with being judged
p147
aVfor something that's beyond my control.
p148
aa(lp149
VThen there was "The Daily Show."
p150
aVOn a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me
p151
aVto be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry
p152
aVand helped me to realize that a person's race,
p153
aVreligion or sexual orientation
p154
aVhad nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
p155
aVHe was in many ways a father figure to me
p156
aVwhen I was in desperate need of one.
p157
aVInspiration can often come from an unexpected place,
p158
aVand the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more
p159
aVto positively influence my worldview
p160
aVthan my own extremist father
p161
aVis not lost on me.
p162
aa(lp163
VOne day, I had a conversation with my mother
p164
aVabout how my worldview was starting to change,
p165
aVand she said something to me
p166
aVthat I will hold dear to my heart
p167
aVfor as long as I live.
p168
aVShe looked at me with the weary eyes
p169
aVof someone who had experienced
p170
aVenough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,
p171
aV"I'm tired of hating people."
p172
aVIn that instant, I realized how much negative energy
p173
aVit takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
p174
aa(lp175
VZak Ebrahim is not my real name.
p176
aVI changed it when my family decided
p177
aVto end our connection with my father
p178
aVand start a new life.
p179
aVSo why would I out myself
p180
aVand potentially put myself in danger?
p181
aVWell, that's simple.
p182
aVI do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday
p183
aVwho is compelled to use violence
p184
aVmay hear my story and realize
p185
aVthat there is a better way,
p186
aVthat although I had been subjected
p187
aVto this violent, intolerant ideology,
p188
aVthat I did not become fanaticized.
p189
aVInstead, I choose to use my experience
p190
aVto fight back against terrorism,
p191
aVagainst the bigotry.
p192
aVI do it for the victims of terrorism
p193
aVand their loved ones,
p194
aVfor the terrible pain and loss
p195
aVthat terrorism has forced upon their lives.
p196
aVFor the victims of terrorism, I will speak out
p197
aVagainst these senseless acts
p198
aVand condemn my father's actions.
p199
aVAnd with that simple fact, I stand here as proof
p200
aVthat violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,
p201
aVand the son does not have to follow
p202
aVthe ways of his father.
p203
aVI am not my father.
p204
aa(lp205
VThank you. (Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you, everybody. (Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VThank you all. (Applause)

aa(lp211
VThanks a lot. (Applause)
