VThis back here was my brain cancer.
p4
aVIsn't it nice?
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVThe key phrase is "was,"
p7
aVphew.
p8
aV(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VHaving brain cancer was really, as you can imagine,
p11
aVshocking news for me.
p12
aVI knew nothing about cancer.
p13
aVIn Western cultures, when you have cancer,
p14
aVit's as if you disappear in a way.
p15
aVYour life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data:
p16
aVYour images, your exams, your lab values,
p17
aVa list of medicines.
p18
aVAnd everyone changes as well.
p19
aVYou suddenly become a disease on legs.
p20
aVDoctors start speaking a language which you don't understand.
p21
aVThey start pointing their fingers
p22
aVat your body and your images.
p23
aVPeople start changing as well
p24
aVbecause they start dealing with the disease,
p25
aVinstead of with the human being.
p26
aVThey say, "What did the doctor say?"
p27
aVbefore even saying, "Hello."
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd in the meanwhile,
p30
aVyou're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer.
p31
aVThese are the "Can I?" questions:
p32
aVCan I work while I have cancer?
p33
aVCan I study? Can I make love? Can I be creative?
p34
aVAnd you wonder, "What have I done to deserve this?"
p35
aVYou wonder, "Can I change something about my lifestyle?"
p36
aVYou wonder, "Can I do something?
p37
aVAre there any other options?"
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd, obviously, doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios,
p40
aVbecause they are very professional and dedicated to curing you.
p41
aVBut they also are very used to having to deal with patients,
p42
aVso I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you
p43
aVand that you become, literally, a patient \u2014
p44
aV"patient" means "the one who waits."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVThings are changing, but classically,
p47
aVthey tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition,
p48
aVto get your friends and family engaged,
p49
aVor showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle
p50
aVto minimize the risks of what you're going through.
p51
aVBut instead, you're forced there to wait
p52
aVin the hands of a series of very professional strangers.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhile I was in the hospital,
p55
aVI asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer
p56
aVand I spoke with it.
p57
aVIt was really hard to obtain,
p58
aVbecause it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
p59
aVI talked to it and I said,
p60
aV"Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me.
p61
aVThere's more to me.
p62
aVA cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me."
p63
aVAnd so, the next day, I left the hospital against medical advice.
p64
aVI was determined to change my relationship with the cancer
p65
aVand I was determined to learn more about my cancer
p66
aVbefore doing anything as drastic as a surgery.
p67
aa(lp68
VI'm an artist, I use several forms of open-source technologies
p69
aVand open information in my practice.
p70
aVSo my best bet was to get it all out there, get the information out there,
p71
aVand use it so that it could be accessed by anyone.
p72
aVSo I created a website, which is called La Cura,
p73
aVon which I put my medical data, online.
p74
aVI actually had to hack it
p75
aVand that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVI chose this word, La Cura \u2014
p78
aVLa Cura in Italian means "the cure" \u2014
p79
aVbecause in many different cultures,
p80
aVthe word "cure" can mean many different things.
p81
aVIn our Western cultures,
p82
aVit means eradicating or reversing a disease,
p83
aVbut in different cultures,
p84
aVfor example, a culture from Asia,
p85
aVfrom the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa,
p86
aVit can mean many more things.
p87
aa(lp88
VOf course, I was interested in the opinions of doctors
p89
aVand healthcare providers,
p90
aVbut I was also interested in the cure of the artist, of the poet,
p91
aVof the designer,
p92
aVof, who knows, the musicians.
p93
aVI was interested in the social cure,
p94
aVI was interested in the psychological cure,
p95
aVI was interested in the spiritual cure,
p96
aVI was interested in the emotional cure,
p97
aVI was interested in any form of cure.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd, it worked.
p100
aVThe La Cura website went viral.
p101
aVI received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad
p102
aVand I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts \u2014
p103
aVemails, social networking \u2014
p104
aVmost of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer,
p105
aVbut more of them were about how to cure myself
p106
aVas a full individual.
p107
aVFor example, many thousands of videos,
p108
aVimages, pictures, art performances
p109
aVwere produced for La Cura.
p110
aVFor example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance.
p111
aVOr, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:
p112
aVHe produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor
p113
aVand put it on sale on Thingiverse.
p114
aVNow you can have my cancer, too!
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVWhich is a nice thing, if you think about it,
p117
aVwe can share our cancer.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd this was going on \u2014
p120
aVscientists, the traditional medicine experts,
p121
aVseveral researchers, doctors \u2014
p122
aVall connected with me to give advice.
p123
aVWith all this information and support,
p124
aVI was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons,
p125
aVtraditional doctors,
p126
aVoncologists, and several hundred volunteers
p127
aVwith whom I was able to discuss
p128
aVthe information I was receiving, which is very important.
p129
aVAnd together, we were able to form a strategy for my own cure
p130
aVin many languages, according to many cultures.
p131
aVAnd the current strategy spans the whole world
p132
aVand thousands of years of human history,
p133
aVwhich is quite remarkable for me.
p134
aV[Surgery]
p135
aa(lp136
VThe follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer.
p137
aVSo I was able to take my time and choose.
p138
aVI chose the doctor I wanted to work with,
p139
aVI chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,
p140
aVand in the meanwhile, I was supported by thousands of people,
p141
aVnone of whom felt pity for me.
p142
aVEveryone felt like they could take an active role
p143
aVin helping me to get well,
p144
aVand this was the most important part of La Cura.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhat are the outcomes?
p147
aVI'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.
p148
aV(Applause)
p149
aVI had excellent news
p150
aVafter the surgery \u2014
p151
aVI have \u2014 I had a very low-grade glioma,
p152
aVwhich is a "good" kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot.
p153
aVI have completely changed my life and my lifestyle.
p154
aVEverything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged.
p155
aa(lp156
VUp until the very last few minutes of the surgery,
p157
aVwhich was very intense,
p158
aVa matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain
p159
aVfrom this side,
p160
aVto be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls.
p161
aVAnd right before the operation,
p162
aVwe were able to discuss the functional map of my brain
p163
aVwith the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into
p164
aVand if there were any I wanted to avoid.
p165
aVObviously, there were.
p166
aV[Open]
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura.
p169
aVThousands of people shared their stories, their experiences.
p170
aVDoctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult
p171
aVwhen they think about cancer.
p172
aVI'm a self-founding, continuous state of translation
p173
aVamong many different languages,
p174
aVin which science meets emotion
p175
aVand conventional research meets traditional research.
p176
aV[Society]
p177
aa(lp178
VThe most important thing of La Cura
p179
aVwas to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society
p180
aVwhose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components.
p181
aVThis global performance is my open-source cure for cancer.
p182
aVAnd from what I feel,
p183
aVit's a cure for me, but for us all.
p184
aa(lp185
VThank you.
