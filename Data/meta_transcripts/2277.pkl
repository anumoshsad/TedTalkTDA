VI love a great mystery,
p4
aVand I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science,
p5
aVperhaps because it's personal.
p6
aVIt's about who we are,
p7
aVand I can't help but be curious.
p8
aa(lp9
VThe mystery is this:
p10
aVWhat is the relationship between your brain
p11
aVand your conscious experiences,
p12
aVsuch as your experience of the taste of chocolate
p13
aVor the feeling of velvet?
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, this mystery is not new.
p16
aVIn 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,
p17
aV"How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about
p18
aVas the result of irritating nervous tissue
p19
aVis just as unaccountable
p20
aVas the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."
p21
aVNow, Huxley knew that brain activity
p22
aVand conscious experiences are correlated,
p23
aVbut he didn't know why.
p24
aVTo the science of his day, it was a mystery.
p25
aVIn the years since Huxley,
p26
aVscience has learned a lot about brain activity,
p27
aVbut the relationship between brain activity
p28
aVand conscious experiences is still a mystery.
p29
aVWhy? Why have we made so little progress?
p30
aVWell, some experts think that we can't solve this problem
p31
aVbecause we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence.
p32
aVWe don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics,
p33
aVand as it happens, we can't expect our species to solve this problem either.
p34
aVWell, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.
p35
aVI think we've simply made a false assumption.
p36
aVOnce we fix it, we just might solve this problem.
p37
aVToday, I'd like tell you what that assumption is,
p38
aVwhy it's false, and how to fix it.
p39
aa(lp40
VLet's begin with a question:
p41
aVDo we see reality as it is?
p42
aVI open my eyes
p43
aVand I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away.
p44
aVAs a result, I come to believe that in reality,
p45
aVthere's a red tomato a meter away.
p46
aVI then close my eyes, and my experience changes to a gray field,
p47
aVbut is it still the case that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away?
p48
aVI think so, but could I be wrong?
p49
aVCould I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions?
p50
aa(lp51
VWe have misinterpreted our perceptions before.
p52
aVWe used to think the Earth is flat, because it looks that way.
p53
aVPythagorus discovered that we were wrong.
p54
aVThen we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe,
p55
aVagain because it looks that way.
p56
aVCopernicus and Galileo discovered, again, that we were wrong.
p57
aa(lp58
VGalileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences
p59
aVin other ways.
p60
aVHe wrote: "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on
p61
aVreside in consciousness.
p62
aVHence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be annihilated."
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, that's a stunning claim.
p65
aVCould Galileo be right?
p66
aVCould we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly?
p67
aVWhat does modern science have to say about this?
p68
aa(lp69
VWell, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex
p70
aVis engaged in vision.
p71
aVWhen you simply open your eyes and look about this room,
p72
aVbillions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, this is a bit surprising,
p75
aVbecause to the extent that we think about vision at all,
p76
aVwe think of it as like a camera.
p77
aVIt just takes a picture of objective reality as it is.
p78
aVNow, there is a part of vision that's like a camera:
p79
aVthe eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye
p80
aVwhere there are 130 million photoreceptors,
p81
aVso the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
p82
aVBut that doesn't explain the billions of neurons
p83
aVand trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision.
p84
aVWhat are these neurons up to?
p85
aa(lp86
VWell, neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time,
p87
aVall the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see.
p88
aVIt feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is,
p89
aVbut in fact, we're constructing everything that we see.
p90
aVWe don't construct the whole world at once.
p91
aVWe construct what we need in the moment.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling
p94
aVthat we construct what we see.
p95
aVI'll just show you two.
p96
aVIn this example, you see some red discs with bits cut out of them,
p97
aVbut if I just rotate the disks a little bit,
p98
aVsuddenly, you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen.
p99
aVNow, the screen of course is flat,
p100
aVso the three-dimensional cube that you're experiencing
p101
aVmust be your construction.
p102
aa(lp103
VIn this next example,
p104
aVyou see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges
p105
aVmoving across a field of dots.
p106
aVIn fact, no dots move.
p107
aVAll I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots
p108
aVfrom blue to black or black to blue.
p109
aVBut when I do this quickly,
p110
aVyour visual system creates the glowing blue bars
p111
aVwith the sharp edges and the motion.
p112
aVThere are many more examples, but these are just two
p113
aVthat you construct what you see.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut neuroscientists go further.
p116
aVThey say that we reconstruct reality.
p117
aVSo, when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato,
p118
aVthat experience is actually an accurate reconstruction
p119
aVof the properties of a real red tomato
p120
aVthat would exist even if I weren't looking.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct,
p123
aVwe reconstruct?
p124
aVWell, the standard argument given
p125
aVis usually an evolutionary one.
p126
aVThose of our ancestors who saw more accurately
p127
aVhad a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately,
p128
aVand therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes.
p129
aVWe are the offspring of those who saw more accurately,
p130
aVand so we can be confident that, in the normal case,
p131
aVour perceptions are accurate.
p132
aVYou see this in the standard textbooks.
p133
aVOne textbook says, for example,
p134
aV"Evolutionarily speaking,
p135
aVvision is useful precisely because it is so accurate."
p136
aVSo the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions.
p137
aVThey give you a survival advantage.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, is this correct?
p140
aVIs this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory?
p141
aVWell, let's first look at a couple of examples in nature.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe Australian jewel beetle
p144
aVis dimpled, glossy and brown.
p145
aVThe female is flightless.
p146
aVThe male flies, looking, of course, for a hot female.
p147
aVWhen he finds one, he alights and mates.
p148
aVThere's another species in the outback,
p149
aVHomo sapiens.
p150
aVThe male of this species has a massive brain
p151
aVthat he uses to hunt for cold beer.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVAnd when he finds one, he drains it,
p154
aVand sometimes throws the bottle into the outback.
p155
aVNow, as it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy,
p156
aVand just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles.
p157
aVThe males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate.
p158
aVThey lose all interest in the real females.
p159
aVClassic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.
p160
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p161
aVThe species almost went extinct.
p162
aVAustralia had to change its bottles to save its beetles.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVNow, the males had successfully found females for thousands,
p165
aVperhaps millions of years.
p166
aVIt looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not.
p167
aVEvolution had given them a hack.
p168
aVA female is anything dimpled, glossy and brown,
p169
aVthe bigger the better.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVEven when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, you might say, beetles, sure, they're very simple creatures,
p174
aVbut surely not mammals.
p175
aVMammals don't rely on tricks.
p176
aVWell, I won't dwell on this, but you get the idea. (Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this raises an important technical question:
p179
aVDoes natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is?
p180
aVFortunately, we don't have to wave our hands and guess;
p181
aVevolution is a mathematically precise theory.
p182
aVWe can use the equations of evolution to check this out.
p183
aVWe can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete
p184
aVand see which survive and which thrive,
p185
aVwhich sensory systems are more fit.
p186
aa(lp187
VA key notion in those equations is fitness.
p188
aVConsider this steak:
p189
aVWhat does this steak do for the fitness of an animal?
p190
aVWell, for a hungry lion looking to eat, it enhances fitness.
p191
aVFor a well-fed lion looking to mate, it doesn't enhance fitness.
p192
aVAnd for a rabbit in any state, it doesn't enhance fitness,
p193
aVso fitness does depend on reality as it is, yes,
p194
aVbut also on the organism, its state and its action.
p195
aVFitness is not the same thing as reality as it is,
p196
aVand it's fitness, and not reality as it is,
p197
aVthat figures centrally in the equations of evolution.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo, in my lab,
p200
aVwe have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations
p201
aVwith lots of different randomly chosen worlds
p202
aVand organisms that compete for resources in those worlds.
p203
aVSome of the organisms see all of the reality,
p204
aVothers see just part of the reality,
p205
aVand some see none of the reality,
p206
aVonly fitness.
p207
aVWho wins?
p208
aa(lp209
VWell, I hate to break it to you, but perception of reality goes extinct.
p210
aVIn almost every simulation,
p211
aVorganisms that see none of reality
p212
aVbut are just tuned to fitness
p213
aVdrive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is.
p214
aVSo the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical,
p215
aVor accurate perceptions.
p216
aVThose perceptions of reality go extinct.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, this is a bit stunning.
p219
aVHow can it be that not seeing the world accurately
p220
aVgives us a survival advantage?
p221
aVThat is a bit counterintuitive.
p222
aVBut remember the jewel beetle.
p223
aVThe jewel beetle survived for thousands, perhaps millions of years,
p224
aVusing simple tricks and hacks.
p225
aVWhat the equations of evolution are telling us
p226
aVis that all organisms, including us,  are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.
p227
aVWe do not see reality as it is.
p228
aVWe're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive.
p229
aa(lp230
VStill,
p231
aVwe need some help with our intuitions.
p232
aVHow can not perceiving reality as it is be useful?
p233
aVWell, fortunately, we have a very helpful metaphor:
p234
aVthe desktop interface on your computer.
p235
aVConsider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing.
p236
aVNow, the icon is blue and rectangular
p237
aVand in the lower right corner of the desktop.
p238
aVDoes that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue,
p239
aVrectangular, and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer?
p240
aVOf course not.
p241
aVAnyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface.
p242
aVIt's not there to show you the reality of the computer.
p243
aVIn fact, it's there to hide that reality.
p244
aVYou don't want to know about the diodes
p245
aVand resistors and all the megabytes of software.
p246
aVIf you had to deal with that, you could never write your text file
p247
aVor edit your photo.
p248
aVSo the idea is that evolution has given us an interface
p249
aVthat hides reality and guides adaptive behavior.
p250
aVSpace and time, as you perceive them right now,
p251
aVare your desktop.
p252
aVPhysical objects are simply icons in that desktop.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere's an obvious objection.
p255
aVHoffman, if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH
p256
aVis just an icon of your desktop,
p257
aVwhy don't you step in front of it?
p258
aVAnd after you're gone, and your theory with you,
p259
aVwe'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon.
p260
aVWell, I wouldn't step in front of that train
p261
aVfor the same reason
p262
aVthat I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can:
p263
aVnot because I take the icon literally \u2014
p264
aVthe file is not literally blue or rectangular \u2014
p265
aVbut I do take it seriously.
p266
aVI could lose weeks of work.
p267
aVSimilarly, evolution has shaped us
p268
aVwith perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive.
p269
aVWe'd better take them seriously.
p270
aVIf you see a snake, don't pick it up.
p271
aVIf you see a cliff, don't jump off.
p272
aVThey're designed to keep us safe, and we should take them seriously.
p273
aVThat does not mean that we should take them literally.
p274
aVThat's a logical error.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnother objection: There's nothing really new here.
p277
aVPhysicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid
p278
aVbut really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around.
p279
aVThere's nothing new here.
p280
aVWell, not exactly.
p281
aVIt's like saying, I know that that blue icon on the desktop
p282
aVis not the reality of the computer,
p283
aVbut if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely,
p284
aVI see little pixels,
p285
aVand that's the reality of the computer.
p286
aVWell, not really \u2014 you're still on the desktop, and that's the point.
p287
aVThose microscopic particles are still in space and time:
p288
aVthey're still in the user interface.
p289
aVSo I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists.
p290
aa(lp291
VFinally, you might object,
p292
aVlook, we all see the train,
p293
aVtherefore none of us constructs the train.
p294
aVBut remember this example.
p295
aVIn this example, we all see a cube,
p296
aVbut the screen is flat,
p297
aVso the cube that you see is the cube that you construct.
p298
aVWe all see a cube
p299
aVbecause we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see.
p300
aVThe same is true of the train.
p301
aVWe all see a train because we each see the train that we construct,
p302
aVand the same is true of all physical objects.
p303
aa(lp304
VWe're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is.
p305
aVThe theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation
p306
aVof our perceptions.
p307
aVInstead, reality is more like a 3D desktop
p308
aVthat's designed to hide the complexity of the real world
p309
aVand guide adaptive behavior.
p310
aVSpace as you perceive it is your desktop.
p311
aVPhysical objects are just the icons in that desktop.
p312
aa(lp313
VWe used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way.
p314
aVThen we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality
p315
aVbecause it looks that way.
p316
aVWe were wrong.
p317
aVWe had misinterpreted our perceptions.
p318
aVNow we believe that spacetime and objects
p319
aVare the nature of reality as it is.
p320
aVThe theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong.
p321
aVWe're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences.
p322
aVThere's something that exists when you don't look,
p323
aVbut it's not spacetime and physical objects.
p324
aVIt's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects
p325
aVas it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle.
p326
aVWhy? Because we're blind to our own blindnesses.
p327
aVBut we have an advantage over the jewel beetle:
p328
aVour science and technology.
p329
aVBy peering through the lens of a telescope
p330
aVwe discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality,
p331
aVand by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution
p332
aVwe discovered that spacetime and objects
p333
aVare not the nature of reality.
p334
aVWhen I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato,
p335
aVI am interacting with reality,
p336
aVbut that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato.
p337
aVSimilarly, when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak,
p338
aVI'm interacting with reality,
p339
aVbut that reality is not a lion or a steak.
p340
aVAnd here's the kicker:
p341
aVWhen I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain, or neurons,
p342
aVI am interacting with reality,
p343
aVbut that reality is not a brain or neurons
p344
aVand is nothing like a brain or neurons.
p345
aVAnd that reality, whatever it is,
p346
aVis the real source of cause and effect
p347
aVin the world \u2014 not brains, not neurons.
p348
aVBrains and neurons have no causal powers.
p349
aVThey cause none of our perceptual experiences,
p350
aVand none of our behavior.
p351
aVBrains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols, a hack.
p352
aa(lp353
VWhat does this mean for the mystery of consciousness?
p354
aVWell, it opens up new possibilities.
p355
aVFor instance,
p356
aVperhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences.
p357
aVI doubt this, but it's worth exploring.
p358
aVPerhaps reality is some vast, interacting network of conscious agents,
p359
aVsimple and complex, that cause each other's conscious experiences.
p360
aVActually, this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems,
p361
aVand I'm currently exploring it.
p362
aa(lp363
VBut here's the point:
p364
aVOnce we let go of our massively intuitive
p365
aVbut massively false assumption about the nature of reality,
p366
aVit opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery.
p367
aVI bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating
p368
aVand unexpected than we've ever imagined.
p369
aa(lp370
VThe theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare:
p371
aVDare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth,
p372
aVit's about having kids.
p373
aVAnd by the way, even this TED is just in your head.
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you very much.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Applause)
p378
aa(lp379
VChris Anderson: If that's really you there, thank you.
p380
aVSo there's so much from this.
p381
aVI mean, first of all, some people may just be profoundly depressed
p382
aVat the thought that, if evolution does not favor reality,
p383
aVI mean, doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here,
p384
aVall our ability to think that we can think the truth,
p385
aVpossibly even including your own theory, if you go there?
p386
aa(lp387
VDonald Hoffman: Well, this does not stop us from a successful science.
p388
aVWhat we have is one theory that turned out to be false,
p389
aVthat perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions.
p390
aVThat theory turns out to be false.
p391
aVOkay, throw that theory away.
p392
aVThat doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories
p393
aVabout the nature of reality,
p394
aVso it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false.
p395
aVSo science continues as normal. There's no problem here.
p396
aa(lp397
VCA: So you think it's possible \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p398
aVThis is cool, but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution
p399
aVcan still get you to reason.
p400
aa(lp401
VDH: Yes. Now that's a very, very good point.
p402
aVThe evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception,
p403
aVand they do show that our perceptions have been shaped
p404
aVnot to show us reality as it is,
p405
aVbut that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics.
p406
aVWe haven't done these simulations, but my bet is that we'll find
p407
aVthat there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics
p408
aVto be at least in the direction of truth.
p409
aVI mean, if you're like me, math and logic is not easy.
p410
aVWe don't get it all right, but at least the selection pressures are not
p411
aVuniformly away from true math and logic.
p412
aVSo I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty
p413
aVone at a time and see what evolution does to it.
p414
aVWhat's true about perception may not be true about math and logic.
p415
aa(lp416
VCA: I mean, really what you're proposing is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley
p417
aVinterpretation of the world:
p418
aVconsciousness causes matter, not the other way around.
p419
aa(lp420
VDH: Well, it's slightly different than Berkeley.
p421
aVBerkeley thought that, he was a deist, and he thought that the ultimate
p422
aVnature of reality is God and so forth,
p423
aVand I don't need to go where Berkeley's going,
p424
aVso it's quite a bit different from Berkeley.
p425
aVI call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach.
p426
aa(lp427
VCA: Don, I could literally talk with you for hours, and I hope to do that.
p428
aa(lp429
VThanks so much for that. DH: Thank you. (Applause)
