VFor the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,
p4
aVand it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.
p5
aVI'll try to spin a story about energy,
p6
aVand oil's a convenient starting place.
p7
aVThe talk will be broadly about energy,
p8
aVbut oil's a good place to start.
p9
aVAnd one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.
p10
aVYou take about eight or so carbon atoms,
p11
aVabout 20 hydrogen atoms,
p12
aVyou put them together in exactly the right way
p13
aVand you get this marvelous liquid:
p14
aVvery energy-dense and very easy to refine
p15
aVinto a number of very useful products and fuels.
p16
aVIt's great stuff.
p17
aVNow, as far as it goes,
p18
aVthere's a lot of oil out there in the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VHere's my little pocket map
p21
aVof where it's all located.
p22
aVA bigger one for you to look at.
p23
aVBut this is it, this is the oil in the world.
p24
aVGeologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
p25
aVThis is about 100 trillion gallons
p26
aVof crude oil
p27
aVstill to be developed and produced in the world today.
p28
aVNow, that's just one story about oil,
p29
aVand we could end it there and say,
p30
aV"Well, oil's going to last forever
p31
aVbecause, well, there's just a lot of it."
p32
aVBut there's actually more to the story than that.
p33
aVOh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,
p34
aV1000 meters below where you're all sitting
p35
aVis one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.
p36
aVCome talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
p39
aVBut what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
p40
aVHere's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,
p41
aVand it's been a dominant part of our energy system
p42
aVfor most of those 150 years.
p43
aVNow, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:
p44
aVFor the last 25 years,
p45
aVoil has been playing less and less of a role
p46
aVin global energy systems.
p47
aVThere was one kind of peak oil in 1985,
p48
aVwhen oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
p49
aVNow, it's about 35 percent.
p50
aVIt's been declining
p51
aVand I believe it will continue to decline.
p52
aVGasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007
p53
aVand is declining.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo oil is playing a less significant role
p56
aVevery year.
p57
aVAnd so, 25 years ago,
p58
aVthere was a peak oil;
p59
aVjust like, in the 1920s,
p60
aVthere was a peak coal;
p61
aVand a hundred years before that,
p62
aVthere was a peak wood.
p63
aVThis is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.
p64
aVAnd what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?
p65
aVWell, a lot of natural gas
p66
aVand a little bit of nuclear, for starters.
p67
aVAnd what goes on in the future?
p68
aVWell, I think out ahead of us a few decades
p69
aVis peak gas,
p70
aVand beyond that,
p71
aVpeak renewables.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I'll tell you another little, very important
p74
aVstory about this picture.
p75
aVNow, I'm not pretending that energy use in total
p76
aVisn't increasing, it is \u2014
p77
aVthat's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,
p78
aVwe'll fill in some of the details \u2014
p79
aVbut there's a very important message here:
p80
aVThis is 200 years of history,
p81
aVand for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing
p82
aVour energy system.
p83
aVEnergy systems of the world
p84
aVbecoming progressively \u2014 year on year,
p85
aVdecade on decade, century on century \u2014
p86
aVbecoming less carbon intense.
p87
aVAnd that continues into the future
p88
aVwith the renewables that we're developing today,
p89
aVreaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy
p90
aVby mid century.
p91
aVNow that might be the end of the story \u2014
p92
aVOkay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables \u2014
p93
aVbut I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd to tell the next part of the story \u2014
p96
aVand this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
p97
aVWhat is the future
p98
aVof truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?
p99
aVWell, we have to take a little excursion,
p100
aVand we'll start in central Texas.
p101
aVHere's a piece of limestone.
p102
aVI picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
p103
aVIt's about 400 million years old.
p104
aVAnd it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.
p105
aVNow, here's a piece of chalk.
p106
aVI picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.
p107
aVAnd it's different than this limestone, you can see that.
p108
aVYou wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,
p109
aVand you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.
p110
aVYeah, it's very different \u2014 no, it's not different.
p111
aVIt's not different, it's the same stuff:
p112
aVcalcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.
p113
aVWhat's different is how the molecules are put together.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, if you think that's kind of neat,
p116
aVthe story gets really neat right now.
p117
aVOff the coast of California comes this:
p118
aVIt's an abalone shell.
p119
aVNow, millions of abalone every year
p120
aVmake this shell.
p121
aVOh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,
p122
aVit's calcium carbonate.
p123
aVIt's the same stuff as this
p124
aVand the same stuff as this.
p125
aVBut it's not the same stuff; it's different.
p126
aVIt's thousands of times,
p127
aVmaybe 3,000 times tougher than this.
p128
aVAnd why? Because the lowly abalone
p129
aVis able to lay down
p130
aVthe calcium carbonate crystals in layers,
p131
aVmaking this beautiful, iridescent
p132
aVmother of pearl.
p133
aVVery specialized material
p134
aVthat the abalone self-assembles,
p135
aVmillions of abalone,
p136
aVall the time, every day, every year.
p137
aVThis is pretty incredible stuff.
p138
aVAll the same, what's different?
p139
aVHow the molecules are put together.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, what does this have to do with energy?
p142
aVHere's a piece of coal.
p143
aVAnd I'll suggest that this coal
p144
aVis about as exciting
p145
aVas this chalk.
p146
aVNow, whether we're talking about fuels
p147
aVor energy carriers,
p148
aVor perhaps novel materials for batteries
p149
aVor fuel cells,
p150
aVnature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet
p151
aVbecause nature didn't need to.
p152
aVNature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,
p153
aVthe survival of a species didn't depend
p154
aVon building those materials,
p155
aVuntil maybe now when it might just matter.
p156
aVSo, when we think about the future of energy,
p157
aVimagine
p158
aVwhat would it be like
p159
aVif instead of this,
p160
aVwe could build the energy equivalent of this
p161
aVjust by rearranging the molecules differently.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd so that is my story.
p164
aVThe oil will never run out.
p165
aVIt's not because we have a lot of it.
p166
aVIt's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.
p167
aVIt's because, well,
p168
aVthousands of years ago,
p169
aVpeople invented ideas \u2014
p170
aVthey had ideas, innovations, technology \u2014
p171
aVand the Stone Age ended,
p172
aVnot because we ran out of stones.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVIt's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology
p175
aVthat will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.
p176
