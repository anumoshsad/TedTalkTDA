(lp3
VWe are drowning in news.
p4
aVReuters alone puts out
p5
aVthree and a half million news stories a year.
p6
aVThat's just one source.
p7
aa(lp8
VMy question is: How many of those stories
p9
aVare actually going to matter in the long run?
p10
aVThat's the idea behind The Long News.
p11
aVIt's a project by The Long Now Foundation,
p12
aVwhich was founded by TEDsters including
p13
aVKevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
p14
aVAnd what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter
p15
aV50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
p16
aVAnd when you look at the news through that filter,
p17
aVa lot falls by the wayside.
p18
aa(lp19
VTo take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,
p20
aVis this going to matter in a decade?
p21
aVOr this?
p22
aVOr this?
p23
aVReally?
p24
aVIs this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
p25
aVOkay, that was kind of cool.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVBut the top story of this past year was the economy,
p28
aVand I'm just betting that, sooner or later,
p29
aVthis particular recession is going to be old news.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, what kind of stories might
p32
aVmake a difference for the future?
p33
aVWell, let's take science.
p34
aVSomeday, little robots will go
p35
aVthrough our bloodstreams fixing things.
p36
aVThat someday is already here if you're a mouse.
p37
aVSome recent stories:
p38
aVnanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;
p39
aVthey're sending genes into the brain;
p40
aVa robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhat about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?
p43
aVWe're having trouble feeding six billion today.
p44
aVAs we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
p45
aVBritain will starve without genetically modified crops.
p46
aVBill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhat about global politics?
p49
aVThe world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,
p50
aVand they may.
p51
aVThey've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,
p52
aVthey've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,
p53
aVand they've started doing DNA tests on kids
p54
aVto choose their careers.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
p57
aVSome recent discoveries:
p58
aVThere's an ant colony from Argentina that has now
p59
aVspread to every continent but Antarctica;
p60
aVthere's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery \u2014
p61
aVsoon, science may no longer need us,
p62
aVand life may no longer need us either;
p63
aVa microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
p64
aVIt seems that with or without us,
p65
aVlife will go on.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut my pick for the top Long News story of this past year
p68
aVwas this one: water found on the moon.
p69
aVMakes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
p70
aVAnd if NASA doesn't do it, China might,
p71
aVor somebody in this room might write a big check.
p72
aa(lp73
VMy point is this:
p74
aVIn the long run, some news stories
p75
aVare more important than others.
