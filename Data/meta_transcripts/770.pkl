VI want to talk about my investigations
p4
aVinto what technology means in our lives \u2014
p5
aVnot just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense,
p6
aVin the kind of long history of the world
p7
aVand our place in the world.
p8
aVWhat is this stuff?
p9
aVWhat is the significance?
p10
aVAnd so, I want to kind of go through my little story
p11
aVof what I found out.
p12
aa(lp13
VOne of the first things I started to investigate
p14
aVwas the history of the name of technology.
p15
aVIn the United States, there is a State of the Union address
p16
aVgiven by every president since 1790.
p17
aVAnd each one of those is kind of summing up the most important things
p18
aVfor the United States at that time.
p19
aVIf you search for the word "technology," it was not used until 1952.
p20
aVSo, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952,
p21
aVwhich happened to be the year of my birth.
p22
aVAnd obviously, technology had existed before then,
p23
aVbut we weren't aware of it.
p24
aVAnd so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life.
p25
aa(lp26
VI actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."
p27
aVIt was in 1829,
p28
aVand it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum \u2014
p29
aVa course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry \u2014
p30
aVand he called it "Technology."
p31
aVAnd that's the very first use of the word.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo what is this stuff
p34
aVthat we're all consumed by and bothered by?
p35
aVAlan Kay calls it, "Technology is anything that was invented
p36
aVafter you were born."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VWhich is sort of the idea we normally have about what technology is:
p41
aVit's all that new stuff.
p42
aVIt's not roads, or penicillin,
p43
aVor factory tires; it's the new stuff.
p44
aVMy friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one,
p45
aVhe says, "Technology is anything that doesn't work yet."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VWhich is, again, a sense that it's all new.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut we know that it's just not new.
p52
aVIt actually goes way back,
p53
aVand what I want to suggest is, it goes a long way back.
p54
aVSo, another way to think about technology, what it means,
p55
aVis to imagine a world without technology.
p56
aVIf we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today \u2014
p57
aVand I mean everything, from blades to scrapers to cloth \u2014
p58
aVwe, as a species, would not live very long.
p59
aVWe would die by the billions, and very quickly:
p60
aVthe wolves would get us, we would be defenseless,
p61
aVwe would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food.
p62
aa(lp63
VEven the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools.
p64
aVSo, they had minimal technology,
p65
aVbut they had some technology.
p66
aVAnd if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes
p67
aVand the Neanderthal, which are very similar to early man,
p68
aVwe find out a very curious thing about this world without technology,
p69
aVand this is a kind of a curve of their average age.
p70
aa(lp71
VThere are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old
p72
aVthat we've ever found,
p73
aVand the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.
p74
aVThere are very few young infants, because they die \u2014 high mortality rate \u2014
p75
aVand there's very few old people.
p76
aVSo the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood:
p77
aVa lot of young people.
p78
aVAnd if you go there, you say, "Hey, everybody's really healthy."
p79
aVWell, that's because they're all young.
p80
aa(lp81
VSame thing with the hunter-gatherer tribes and early man:
p82
aVyou didn't live beyond the age of 30.
p83
aVSo it was a world without grandparents.
p84
aVAnd grandparents are very important,
p85
aVbecause they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.
p86
aVImagine a world where basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old.
p87
aVHow much learning can you do?
p88
aVYou can't do very much learning in your own life,
p89
aVit's so short,
p90
aVand there's nobody to pass on what you do learn.
p91
aVSo that's one aspect.
p92
aa(lp93
VIt was a very short life.
p94
aVBut at the same time, anthropologists know
p95
aVthat most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world,
p96
aVwith that very little technology,
p97
aVactually did not spend a very long time gathering the food they needed:
p98
aVthree to six hours a day.
p99
aVSome anthropologists call that the original affluent society,
p100
aVbecause they had bankers' hours, basically.
p101
aVSo it was possible to get enough food.
p102
aVBut when the scarcity came,
p103
aVwhen the highs and lows and the droughts came,
p104
aVthen people went into starvation.
p105
aVAnd that's why they didn't live very long.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo what technology brought,
p108
aVthrough the very simple tools like these stone tools here \u2014
p109
aVeven something as small as this \u2014
p110
aVthe early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction
p111
aVabout 250 megafauna animals in North America
p112
aVwhen they first arrived 10,000 years ago.
p113
aVSo, long before the industrial age,
p114
aVwe've been affecting the planet on a global scale
p115
aVwith just a small amount of technology.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe other thing that the early man invented was fire.
p118
aVAnd fire was used to clear out, and again,
p119
aVaffected the ecology of grass and whole continents,
p120
aVand was used in cooking.
p121
aVIt enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.
p122
aVIt was, in a certain sense, in a McLuhan sense,
p123
aVan external stomach,
p124
aVin the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise.
p125
aVAnd if we didn't have fire, we actually could not live.
p126
aVOur bodies have adapted to these new diets.
p127
aVOur bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, with that little bit of technology,
p130
aVhumans went from a small band of 10,000 or so \u2014
p131
aVthe same number as Neanderthals everywhere \u2014
p132
aVand we suddenly exploded.
p133
aVWith the invention of language around 50,000 years ago,
p134
aVthe number of humans exploded,
p135
aVand very quickly became the dominant species on the planet.
p136
aVAnd they migrated into the rest of the world
p137
aVat two kilometers per year
p138
aVuntil, within several tens of thousands of years,
p139
aVwe occupied every single watershed on the planet
p140
aVand became the most dominant species,
p141
aVwith a very small amount of technology.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd even at that time, with the introduction of agriculture,
p144
aV8,000, 10,000 years ago,
p145
aVwe started to see climate change.
p146
aVSo climate change is not a new thing; what's new is just the degree of it.
p147
aVEven during the agricultural age, there was climate change.
p148
aVSo already, small amounts of technology were transforming the world.
p149
aVAnd what this means, and where I'm going,
p150
aVis that technology has become the most powerful force in the world.
p151
aVAll the things we see today that are changing our lives,
p152
aVwe can always trace back
p153
aVto the introduction of some new technology.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo it's a force,
p156
aVthat is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet,
p157
aVand in such a degree,
p158
aVthat I think it's become who we are.
p159
aVIn fact, our humanity and everything that we think about ourselves,
p160
aVis something we've invented.
p161
aVSo we've invented ourselves.
p162
aVOf all the animals that we've domesticated,
p163
aVthe most important animal has been us.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo humanity is our greatest invention,
p166
aVbut of course, we're not done yet.
p167
aVWe're still inventing,
p168
aVand this is what technology is allowing us to do;
p169
aVit's continually to reinvent ourselves.
p170
aVIt's a very, very strong force.
p171
aVI call this entire thing \u2014 us humans as our technology,
p172
aVeverything that we've made, gadgets in our lives \u2014
p173
aVwe call that the technium.
p174
aVThat's this world.
p175
aVMy working definition of technology is:
p176
aVanything useful that a human mind makes.
p177
aVIt's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops.
p178
aVBut it's also law.
p179
aVAnd, of course, cities are ways to make things more useful to us.
p180
aVWhile this is something that comes from our mind,
p181
aVit also has its roots deeply into the cosmos.
p182
aa(lp183
VIt goes back.
p184
aVThe origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang,
p185
aVin this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread
p186
aVthat starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars,
p187
aVinto life, into us.
p188
aVAnd the three major phases of the early universe
p189
aVwas energy, when the dominant force was energy;
p190
aVthen the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter;
p191
aVand then, with the invention of life four billion years ago,
p192
aVthe dominant force in our neighborhood became information.
p193
aVThat's what life is:
p194
aVan information process that was restructuring
p195
aVand making new order.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, energy and matter, Einstein showed were equivalent,
p198
aVand now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information
p199
aVand matter and energy
p200
aVare all interrelated.
p201
aVSo it's one long continuum.
p202
aVYou put energy into the right kind of system,
p203
aVand out comes wasted heat, entropy,
p204
aVand extropy, which is order.
p205
aVIt's the increased order.
p206
aa(lp207
VWhere does this order come from?
p208
aVIts roots go way back.
p209
aVWe actually don't know.
p210
aVBut we do know
p211
aVthat the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long,
p212
aVand it began with things like galaxies;
p213
aVthey maintained their order for billions of years.
p214
aVStars are basically nuclear fission machines
p215
aVthat self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years:
p216
aVorder against the extropy of the world.
p217
aVAnd flowers and plants are the same thing, extended,
p218
aVand technology is basically an extension of life.
p219
aa(lp220
VOne trend that we notice in all those things
p221
aVis that the amount of energy per gram per second
p222
aVthat flows through this
p223
aVis actually increasing.
p224
aVThe amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence.
p225
aVAnd the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life
p226
aVis actually greater than a star \u2014
p227
aVbecause of the star's long lifespan,
p228
aVthe energy density in life is actually higher than a star.
p229
aVAnd the energy density that we see in the greatest amount
p230
aVanywhere in the universe
p231
aVis actually in a PC chip.
p232
aVThere is more energy flowing through, per gram per second,
p233
aVthan anything that we have any other experience with.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd so, what I would suggest
p236
aVis that if you want to see where technology is going,
p237
aVwe continue that trajectory,
p238
aVand we say, "Well, it's going to become more energy-dense,
p239
aVthat's where it's going."
p240
aVAnd so what I've done is, I've taken the same kinds of things
p241
aVand looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say,
p242
aV"What are the general trends in evolutionary life?"
p243
aVAnd there are things moving towards greater complexity,
p244
aVmoving towards greater diversity, moving towards greater specialization,
p245
aVsentience, ubiquity, and most important, evolvability.
p246
aVThose very same things are also present in technology.
p247
aVThat's where technology is going.
p248
aa(lp249
VIn fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life.
p250
aVAnd we can see that happening;
p251
aVjust as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make.
p252
aVThings in life start off being general cells,
p253
aVand they become specialized:
p254
aVyou have tissue cells, muscle, brain cells.
p255
aVThe same thing happens with, say, a hammer,
p256
aVwhich is general at first and becomes more specific.
p257
aVSo I would like to say that while there are six kingdoms of life,
p258
aVwe can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life.
p259
aVIt's a branching off from the human form.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself.
p262
aVFor instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use
p263
aVis actually used to feed the technium itself.
p264
aVIn transportation, it's not to move us;
p265
aVit's to move the stuff we make or buy.
p266
aVI use the word "want." Technology wants.
p267
aVThis is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power.
p268
aVYour cat wants more food.
p269
aVA bacterium, which has no consciousness at all,
p270
aVwants to move towards light.
p271
aVIt has an urge, and technology has an urge.
p272
aa(lp273
VAt the same time, it wants to give us things,
p274
aVand what it gives us is basically progress.
p275
aVYou can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up.
p276
aVThere's really no dispute about progress,
p277
aVif we discount the cost of that.
p278
aVAnd that's the thing that bothers most people,
p279
aVis that progress is really real, but we wonder and question:
p280
aVWhat are the environmental costs of it?
p281
aa(lp282
VI did a survey of the number of species of artifacts in my house,
p283
aVand there's 6,000.
p284
aVOther people have come up with 10,000.
p285
aVWhen King Henry of England died,
p286
aVhe had 18,000 things in his house,
p287
aVbut that was the entire wealth of England, so ...
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd with that entire wealth of England,
p292
aVKing Henry could not buy any antibiotics,
p293
aVhe could not buy refrigeration,
p294
aVhe could not buy a trip of a thousand miles,
p295
aVwhereas this rickshaw wallah in India could save up and buy antibiotics
p296
aVand he could buy refrigeration.
p297
aVHe could buy things that King Henry, in all his wealth, could never buy.
p298
aVThat's what progress is about.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo, technology is selfish; technology is generous.
p301
aVThat conflict, that tension, will be with us forever:
p302
aVsometimes it wants to do what it wants to do,
p303
aVand sometimes it's going to do things for us.
p304
aVWe have confusion about what we should think
p305
aVabout a new technology.
p306
aVRight now the default position when a new technology comes along,
p307
aVis people talk about the precautionary principle,
p308
aVwhich is very common in Europe,
p309
aVwhich says, basically, "Don't do anything.
p310
aVWhen you meet a new technology, stop,
p311
aVuntil it can be proven that it does no harm."
p312
aVI think that really leads nowhere.
p313
aa(lp314
VBut a better way is what I call the proactionary principle,
p315
aVwhich is, you engage with technology.
p316
aVYou try it out.
p317
aVYou obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests,
p318
aVyou try to anticipate it,
p319
aVbut after anticipating it,
p320
aVyou constantly asses it,
p321
aVnot just once, but eternally.
p322
aVAnd when it diverts from what you want,
p323
aVwe prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff,
p324
aVbut the old stuff.
p325
aVWe fix it; but most importantly,
p326
aVwe relocate it.
p327
aVAnd what I mean by that is,
p328
aVwe find a new job for it.
p329
aa(lp330
VNuclear energy, fission, is a really bad idea for bombs.
p331
aVBut it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy
p332
aVfor electricity, instead of burning coal.
p333
aVWhen we have a bad idea,
p334
aVthe response to a bad idea
p335
aVis not no ideas, it's not to stop thinking.
p336
aVThe response to a bad idea \u2014
p337
aVlike, say, a tungsten lightbulb \u2014
p338
aVis a better idea.
p339
aVSo, better ideas is really always the response
p340
aVto technology we don't like;
p341
aVit's basically better technology.
p342
aVAnd actually, in a certain sense, technology is a kind of a method
p343
aVfor generating better ideas,
p344
aVif you can think about it that way.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo, maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea.
p347
aVBut DDT sprayed on local homes \u2014
p348
aVthere's nothing better to eliminate malaria,
p349
aVbesides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets.
p350
aVBut that's a really good idea; that's a good job for technology.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo our job as humans is to parent our mind children,
p353
aVto find them good friends,
p354
aVto find them a good job.
p355
aVAnd so, every technology is sort of a creative force
p356
aVlooking for the right job.
p357
aVThat's actually my son, right here.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VThere are no bad technologies,
p362
aVjust as there are no bad children.
p363
aVWe don't say children are neutral; children are positive.
p364
aVWe just have to find them the right place.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd so, what technology gives us over the long term \u2014
p367
aVover this sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time,
p368
aVthrough the invention of the plants and animals,
p369
aVand the evolution of life, the evolution of brains \u2014
p370
aVwhat that is constantly giving us is increasing differences:
p371
aVIt's increasing diversity, it's increasing options,
p372
aVit's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
p373
aVThat's what we get from technology all the time.
p374
aVThat's why people leave villages and go into cities \u2014
p375
aVbecause they are always gravitating towards increased choices
p376
aVand possibilities.
p377
aVAnd we are aware of the price;
p378
aVwe pay a price for that, but we're aware of it,
p379
aVand generally, we will pay the price for increased freedoms,
p380
aVchoices and opportunities.
p381
aa(lp382
VEven technology wants clean water.
p383
aVIs technology diametrically opposed to nature?
p384
aVBecause technology is an extension of life,
p385
aVit's in parallel and aligned with the same things
p386
aVthat life wants.
p387
aVSo that I think technology loves biology,
p388
aVif we allow it to.
p389
aVGreat movement starting billions of years ago
p390
aVis moving through us and it continues to go,
p391
aVand our choice, so to speak, in technology,
p392
aVis really to align ourselves with this force
p393
aVmuch greater than ourselves.
p394
aa(lp395
VSo, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket;
p396
aVit's more than just gadgets,
p397
aVit's more than just things that people invent.
p398
aVIt's actually part of a very long story \u2014 a great story \u2014
p399
aVthat began billions of years ago.
p400
aVIt's moving through us, this self-organization,
p401
aVand we're extending and accelerating it,
p402
aVand we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it.
p403
aVAnd I really appreciate your attention today.
p404
