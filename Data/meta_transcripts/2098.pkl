VI want to tell you
p4
aVhow 20,000 remarkable young people
p5
aVfrom over 100 countries
p6
aVended up in Cuba
p7
aVand are transforming health in their communities.
p8
aVNinety percent of them would never
p9
aVhave left home at all
p10
aVif it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba
p11
aVand a commitment to go back
p12
aVto places like the ones they'd come from \u2014
p13
aVremote farmlands, mountains, ghettos \u2014
p14
aVto become doctors for people like themselves,
p15
aVto walk the walk.

VHavana's Latin American Medical School:
p18
aVIt's the largest medical school in the world,
p19
aVgraduating 23,000 young doctors
p20
aVsince its first class of 2005,
p21
aVwith nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.
p22
aVIts mission, to train physicians for the people
p23
aVwho need them the most:
p24
aVthe over one billion
p25
aVwho have never seen a doctor,
p26
aVthe people who live and die
p27
aVunder every poverty line ever invented.
p28
aVIts students defy all norms.
p29
aVThey're the school's biggest risk
p30
aVand also its best bet.
p31
aVThey're recruited from the poorest,
p32
aVmost broken places on our planet
p33
aVby a school that believes they can become
p34
aVnot just the good
p35
aVbut the excellent physicians
p36
aVtheir communities desperately need,
p37
aVthat they will practice where most doctors don't,
p38
aVin places not only poor
p39
aVbut oftentimes dangerous,
p40
aVcarrying venom antidotes in their backpacks
p41
aVor navigating neighborhoods
p42
aVriddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,
p43
aVtheir home ground.
p44
aVThe hope is that they will help
p45
aVtransform access to care,
p46
aVthe health picture in impoverished areas,
p47
aVand even the way medicine itself
p48
aVis learned and practiced,
p49
aVand that they will become pioneers in our global reach
p50
aVfor universal health coverage,
p51
aVsurely a tall order.
p52
aVTwo big storms and this notion of "walk the walk"
p53
aVprompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.
p54
aVThe Hurricanes Georges and Mitch
p55
aVhad ripped through the Caribbean
p56
aVand Central America,
p57
aVleaving 30,000 dead
p58
aVand two and a half million homeless.
p59
aVHundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response,
p60
aVbut when they got there,
p61
aVthey found a bigger disaster:
p62
aVwhole communities with no healthcare,
p63
aVdoors bolted shut on rural hospitals
p64
aVfor lack of staff,
p65
aVand just too many babies dying
p66
aVbefore their first birthday.
p67
aVWhat would happen when these Cuban doctors left?
p68
aVNew doctors were needed to make care sustainable,
p69
aVbut where would they come from?
p70
aVWhere would they train?
p71
aa(lp72
VIn Havana, the campus of a former naval academy
p73
aVwas turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry
p74
aVto become the Latin American Medical School,
p75
aVELAM.
p76
aVTuition, room and board, and a small stipend
p77
aVwere offered to hundreds of students
p78
aVfrom the countries hardest hit by the storms.
p79
aVAs a journalist in Havana,
p80
aVI watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive
p81
aVin March 1999,
p82
aVsettling into dorms barely refurbished
p83
aVand helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms
p84
aVbut move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes.
p85
aVOver the next few years,
p86
aVgovernments throughout the Americas
p87
aVrequested scholarships for their own students,
p88
aVand the Congressional Black Caucus
p89
aVasked for and received hundreds of scholarships
p90
aVfor young people from the USA.
p91
aVToday, among the 23,000
p92
aVare graduates from 83 countries
p93
aVin the Americas, Africa and Asia,
p94
aVand enrollment has grown to 123 nations.
p95
aVMore than half the students are young women.
p96
aVThey come from 100 ethnic groups,
p97
aVspeak 50 different languages.
p98
aVWHO Director Margaret Chan said,
p99
aV"For once, if you are poor, female,
p100
aVor from an indigenous population,
p101
aVyou have a distinct advantage,
p102
aVan ethic that makes this medical school unique."
p103
aa(lp104
VLuther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho
p105
aVon the Atlantic coast of Honduras.
p106
aVThere's no running water,
p107
aVno electricity there,
p108
aVand to reach the village, you have to walk for hours
p109
aVor take your chances in a pickup truck like I did
p110
aVskirting the waves of the Atlantic.
p111
aVLuther was one of 40 Tocamacho children
p112
aVwho started grammar school,
p113
aVthe sons and daughters of a black indigenous people
p114
aVknown as the Garífuna,
p115
aV20 percent of the Honduran population.
p116
aVThe nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.
p117
aVLuther had to walk three hours every day
p118
aVto middle school.
p119
aVOnly 17 made that trip.
p120
aVOnly five went on to high school,
p121
aVand only one to university:
p122
aVLuther, to ELAM,
p123
aVamong the first crop of Garífuna graduates.
p124
aVJust two Garífuna doctors had preceded them
p125
aVin all of Honduran history.
p126
aVNow there are 69, thanks to ELAM.
p127
aa(lp128
VBig problems need big solutions,
p129
aVsparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,
p130
aVbut also solutions that work.
p131
aVELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base
p132
aVto guide them, so they learned the hard way,
p133
aVby doing and correcting course as they went.
p134
aVEven the brightest students
p135
aVfrom these poor communities
p136
aVweren't academically prepared
p137
aVfor six years of medical training,
p138
aVso a bridging course was set up in sciences.
p139
aVThen came language:
p140
aVthese were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,
p141
aVindigenous peoples
p142
aVwho learned Spanish as a second language,
p143
aVor Haitians who spoke Creole.
p144
aVSo Spanish became part
p145
aVof the pre-pre-med curriculum.
p146
aVEven so, in Cuba,
p147
aVthe music, the food, the smells,
p148
aVjust about everything was different,
p149
aVso faculty became family, ELAM home.
p150
aVReligions ranged from indigenous beliefs
p151
aVto Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.
p152
aVEmbracing diversity became a way of life.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhy have so many countries
p155
aVasked for these scholarships?
p156
aVFirst, they just don't have enough doctors,
p157
aVand where they do, their distribution
p158
aVis skewed against the poor,
p159
aVbecause our global health crisis
p160
aVis fed by a crisis in human resources.
p161
aVWe are short four to seven million health workers
p162
aVjust to meet basic needs,
p163
aVand the problem is everywhere.
p164
aVDoctors are concentrated in the cities,
p165
aVwhere only half the world's people live,
p166
aVand within cities,
p167
aVnot in the shantytowns or South L.A.
p168
aVHere in the United States,
p169
aVwhere we have healthcare reform,
p170
aVwe don't have the professionals we need.
p171
aVBy 2020, we will be short
p172
aV45,000 primary care physicians.
p173
aVAnd we're also part of the problem.
p174
aVThe United States is the number one importer
p175
aVof doctors from developing countries.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe second reasons students flock to Cuba
p178
aVis the island's own health report card,
p179
aVrelying on strong primary care.
p180
aVA commission from The Lancet
p181
aVrates Cuba among the best performing
p182
aVmiddle-income countries in health.
p183
aVSave the Children ranks Cuba
p184
aVthe best country in Latin America to become a mother.
p185
aVCuba has similar life expectancy
p186
aVand lower infant mortality than the United States,
p187
aVwith fewer disparities,
p188
aVwhile spending per person
p189
aVone 20th of what we do on health
p190
aVhere in the USA.
p191
aa(lp192
VAcademically, ELAM is tough,
p193
aVbut 80 percent of its students graduate.
p194
aVThe subjects are familiar \u2014
p195
aVbasic and clinical sciences \u2014
p196
aVbut there are major differences.
p197
aVFirst, training has moved out of the ivory tower
p198
aVand into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,
p199
aVthe kinds of places most of these grads will practice.
p200
aVSure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,
p201
aVbut community-based learning starts on day one.
p202
aVSecond, students treat the whole patient,
p203
aVmind and body,
p204
aVin the context of their  families, their communities
p205
aVand their culture.
p206
aVThird, they learn public health:
p207
aVto assess their patients' drinking water, housing,
p208
aVsocial and economic conditions.
p209
aVFourth, they are taught
p210
aVthat a good patient interview
p211
aVand a thorough clinical exam
p212
aVprovide most of the clues for diagnosis,
p213
aVsaving costly technology for confirmation.
p214
aVAnd finally, they're taught over and over again
p215
aVthe importance of prevention,
p216
aVespecially as chronic diseases
p217
aVcripple health systems worldwide.
p218
aa(lp219
VSuch an in-service learning
p220
aValso comes with a team approach,
p221
aVas much how to work in teams
p222
aVas how to lead them,
p223
aVwith a dose of humility.
p224
aVUpon graduation, these doctors share
p225
aVtheir knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,
p226
aVcommunity health workers,
p227
aVto help them become better at what they do,
p228
aVnot to replace them,
p229
aVto work with shamans and traditional healers.
p230
aa(lp231
VELAM's graduates:
p232
aVAre they proving this audacious experiment right?
p233
aVDozens of projects give us an inkling
p234
aVof what they're capable of doing.
p235
aVTake the Garífuna grads.
p236
aVThey not only went to work back home,
p237
aVbut they organized their communities to build
p238
aVHonduras' first indigenous hospital.
p239
aVWith an architect's help,
p240
aVresidents literally raised it from the ground up.
p241
aVThe first patients walked through the doors
p242
aVin December 2007,
p243
aVand since then, the hospital has received
p244
aVnearly one million patient visits.
p245
aVAnd government is paying attention,
p246
aVupholding the hospital as a model
p247
aVof rural public health for Honduras.
p248
aa(lp249
VELAM's graduates are smart,
p250
aVstrong and also dedicated.
p251
aVHaiti, January 2010.
p252
aVThe pain.
p253
aVPeople buried under 30 million tons of rubble.
p254
aVOverwhelming.
p255
aVThree hundred forty Cuban doctors
p256
aVwere already on the ground long term.
p257
aVMore were on their way. Many more were needed.
p258
aVAt ELAM, students worked round the clock
p259
aVto contact 2,000 graduates.
p260
aVAs a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,
p261
aV27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara
p262
aVto St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.
p263
aVThey spoke easily to each other in Spanish
p264
aVand listened to their patients in Creole
p265
aVthanks to Haitian medical students
p266
aVflown in from ELAM in Cuba.
p267
aVMany stayed for months,
p268
aVeven through the cholera epidemic.
p269
aa(lp270
VHundreds of Haitian graduates
p271
aVhad to pick up the pieces,
p272
aVovercome their own heartbreak,
p273
aVand then pick up the burden
p274
aVof building a new public health system for Haiti.
p275
aVToday, with aid of organizations and governments
p276
aVfrom Norway to Cuba to Brazil,
p277
aVdozens of new health centers have been built,
p278
aVstaffed, and in 35 cases, headed
p279
aVby ELAM graduates.
p280
aa(lp281
VYet the Haitian story
p282
aValso illustrates some of the bigger problems
p283
aVfaced in many countries.
p284
aVTake a look:
p285
aV748 Haitian graduates by  2012, when cholera struck,
p286
aVnearly half working in the public health sector
p287
aVbut one quarter unemployed,
p288
aVand 110 had left Haiti altogether.
p289
aVSo in the best case scenarios,
p290
aVthese graduates are staffing
p291
aVand thus strengthening public health systems,
p292
aVwhere often they're the only doctors around.
p293
aVIn the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs
p294
aVin the public health sector,
p295
aVwhere most poor people are treated,
p296
aVnot enough political will, not enough resources,
p297
aVnot enough anything \u2014
p298
aVjust too many patients with no care.
p299
aVThe grads face pressure from their families too,
p300
aVdesperate to make ends meet,
p301
aVso when there are no public sector jobs,
p302
aVthese new MDs decamp into private practice,
p303
aVor go abroad to send money home.
p304
aa(lp305
VWorst of all, in some countries,
p306
aVmedical societies influence accreditation bodies
p307
aVnot to honor the ELAM degree,
p308
aVfearful these grads will take their jobs
p309
aVor reduce their patient loads and income.
p310
aVIt's not a question of competencies.
p311
aVHere in the USA, the California Medical Board
p312
aVaccredited the school after rigorous inspection,
p313
aVand the new physicians are making good
p314
aVon Cuba's big bet,
p315
aVpassing their boards and accepted
p316
aVinto highly respected residencies
p317
aVfrom New York to Chicago to New Mexico.
p318
aVTwo hundred strong, they're coming
p319
aVback to the United States energized,
p320
aVand also dissatisfied.
p321
aVAs one grad put it,
p322
aVin Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care
p323
aVwith minimal resources,
p324
aVso when I see all the resources we have here,
p325
aVand you tell me that's not possible,
p326
aVI know it's not true.
p327
aVNot only have I seen it work, I've done the work."
p328
aa(lp329
VELAM's graduates,
p330
aVsome from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,
p331
aVhave come from the poorest of the poor
p332
aVto offer health, education
p333
aVand a voice to their communities.
p334
aVThey've done the heavy lifting.
p335
aVNow we need to do our part
p336
aVto support the 23,000 and counting,
p337
aVAll of us \u2014
p338
aVfoundations, residency directors, press,
p339
aVentrepreneurs, policymakers, people \u2014
p340
aVneed to step up.
p341
aVWe need to do much more globally
p342
aVto give these new doctors the opportunity
p343
aVto prove their mettle.
p344
aVThey need to be able
p345
aVto take their countries' licensing exams.
p346
aVThey need jobs in the public health sector
p347
aVor in nonprofit health centers
p348
aVto put their training and commitment to work.
p349
aVThey need the chance to be
p350
aVthe doctors their patients need.
p351
aa(lp352
VTo move forward,
p353
aVwe may have to find our way back
p354
aVto that pediatrician who would
p355
aVknock on my family's door
p356
aVon the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,
p357
aVwho made house calls,
p358
aVwho was a public servant.
p359
aVThese aren't such new ideas
p360
aVof what medicine should be.
p361
aVWhat's new is the scaling up
p362
aVand the faces of the doctors themselves:
p363
aVan ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she
p364
aVthan a he;
p365
aVIn the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,
p366
aVan indigenous doctor;
p367
aVin the USA, a doctor of color
p368
aVwho speaks fluent Spanish.
p369
aVShe is well trained, can be counted on,
p370
aVand shares the face and culture of her patients,
p371
aVand she deserves our support surely,
p372
aVbecause whether by subway, mule, or canoe,
p373
aVshe is teaching us to walk the walk.
