VI admit that I'm a little bit nervous here
p4
aVbecause I'm going to say some radical things,
p5
aVabout how we should think about cancer differently,
p6
aVto an audience that contains a lot of people
p7
aVwho know a lot more about cancer than I do.
p8
aVBut I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be
p9
aVbecause I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVAnd that this, in fact, will be
p12
aVthe way that we treat cancer in the future.
p13
aVIn order to talk about cancer,
p14
aVI'm going to actually have to \u2014
p15
aVlet me get the big slide here.
p16
aVFirst, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.
p17
aVI want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture
p18
aVof all the other things that are going on \u2014
p19
aVand then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.
p20
aVHaving explained those,
p21
aVthat will set up for what I think will be a different idea
p22
aVabout how to go about treating cancer.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo let me start with genomics.
p25
aVIt is the hot topic.
p26
aVIt is the place where we're learning the most.
p27
aVThis is the great frontier.
p28
aVBut it has its limitations.
p29
aVAnd in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy
p30
aVthat the genome is like the blueprint of your body,
p31
aVand if that were only true, it would be great,
p32
aVbut it's not.
p33
aVIt's like the parts list of your body.
p34
aVIt doesn't say how things are connected,
p35
aVwhat causes what and so on.
p36
aVSo if I can make an analogy,
p37
aVlet's say that you were trying to tell the difference
p38
aVbetween a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant
p39
aVand a sick restaurant,
p40
aVand all you had was the list of ingredients
p41
aVthat they had in their larder.
p42
aVSo it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant
p43
aVand you looked through it and you found
p44
aVthey only had margarine and they didn't have butter,
p45
aVyou could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.
p46
aVI can make them healthy."
p47
aVAnd there probably are special cases of that.
p48
aVYou could certainly tell the difference
p49
aVbetween a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant
p50
aVby what they had in a larder.
p51
aVSo the list of ingredients does tell you something,
p52
aVand sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.
p53
aVIf they have tons of salt,
p54
aVyou might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.
p55
aVBut it's limited,
p56
aVbecause really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,
p57
aVyou need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,
p58
aVyou need the product of all of those ingredients.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo if I look at a person
p61
aVand I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.
p62
aVThe part of the genome that we can read
p63
aVis the list of ingredients.
p64
aVAnd so indeed,
p65
aVthere are times when we can find ingredients
p66
aVthat [are] bad.
p67
aVCystic fibrosis is an example of a disease
p68
aVwhere you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,
p69
aVand we can actually make a direct correspondence
p70
aVbetween the ingredient and the disease.
p71
aVBut most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,
p72
aVbecause, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people \u2014
p73
aVthey have the same genome.
p74
aVSo the genome really tells you much more
p75
aVabout predisposition.
p76
aVSo what you can tell
p77
aVis you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person
p78
aVby looking at their ingredients list.
p79
aVBut you really for the most part can't tell the difference
p80
aVbetween a healthy person and a sick person \u2014
p81
aVexcept in some of these special cases.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo why all the big deal
p84
aVabout genetics?
p85
aVWell first of all,
p86
aVit's because we can read it, which is fantastic.
p87
aVIt is very useful in certain circumstances.
p88
aVIt's also the great theoretical triumph
p89
aVof biology.
p90
aVIt's the one theory
p91
aVthat the biologists ever really got right.
p92
aVIt's fundamental to Darwin
p93
aVand Mendel and so on.
p94
aVAnd so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.
p95
aVSo Mendel had this idea of a gene
p96
aVas an abstract thing,
p97
aVand Darwin built a whole theory
p98
aVthat depended on them existing,
p99
aVand then Watson and Crick
p100
aVactually looked and found one.
p101
aVSo this happens in physics all the time.
p102
aVYou predict a black hole,
p103
aVand you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.
p104
aVBut it rarely happens in biology.
p105
aVSo this great triumph \u2014 it's so good,
p106
aVthere's almost a religious experience
p107
aVin biology.
p108
aVAnd Darwinian evolution
p109
aVis really the core theory.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo the other reason it's been very popular
p112
aVis because we can measure it, it's digital.
p113
aVAnd in fact,
p114
aVthanks to Kary Mullis,
p115
aVyou can basically measure your genome in your kitchen
p116
aVwith a few extra ingredients.
p117
aVSo for instance, by measuring the genome,
p118
aVwe've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals
p119
aVby the closeness of our genome,
p120
aVor how we're related to each other \u2014 the family tree,
p121
aVor the tree of life.
p122
aVThere's a huge amount of information about the genetics
p123
aVjust by comparing the genetic similarity.
p124
aVNow of course, in medical application,
p125
aVthat is very useful
p126
aVbecause it's the same kind of information
p127
aVthat the doctor gets from your family medical history \u2014
p128
aVexcept probably,
p129
aVyour genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.
p130
aVAnd so by reading the genome,
p131
aVwe can find out much more about your family than you probably know.
p132
aVAnd so we can discover things
p133
aVthat probably you could have found
p134
aVby looking at enough of your relatives,
p135
aVbut they may be surprising.
p136
aVI did the 23andMe thing
p137
aVand was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVBut sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut mostly
p142
aVwhat you need to know, to find out if you're sick,
p143
aVis not your predispositions,
p144
aVbut it's actually what's going on in your body right now.
p145
aVSo to do that, what you really need to do,
p146
aVyou need to look at the things
p147
aVthat the genes are producing
p148
aVand what's happening after the genetics,
p149
aVand that's what proteomics is about.
p150
aVJust like genome mixes the study of all the genes,
p151
aVproteomics is the study of all the proteins.
p152
aVAnd the proteins are all of the little things in your body
p153
aVthat are signaling between the cells \u2014
p154
aVactually, the machines that are operating \u2014
p155
aVthat's where the action is.
p156
aVBasically, a human body
p157
aVis a conversation going on,
p158
aVboth within the cells and between the cells,
p159
aVand they're telling each other to grow and to die,
p160
aVand when you're sick,
p161
aVsomething's gone wrong with that conversation.
p162
aVAnd so the trick is \u2014
p163
aVunfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these
p164
aVlike we can measure the genome.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo the problem is that measuring \u2014
p167
aVif you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.
p168
aVIt requires hundreds of steps,
p169
aVand it takes a long, long time.
p170
aVAnd it matters how much of the protein it is.
p171
aVIt could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,
p172
aVso it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.
p173
aVAnd basically our problem is somebody's in the middle
p174
aVof this very long stage,
p175
aVthey pause for just a moment,
p176
aVand they leave something in an enzyme for a second,
p177
aVand all of a sudden all the measurements from then on
p178
aVdon't work.
p179
aVAnd so then people get very inconsistent results
p180
aVwhen they do it this way.
p181
aVPeople have tried very hard to do this.
p182
aVI tried this a couple of times
p183
aVand looked at this problem and gave up on it.
p184
aa(lp185
VI kept getting this call from this oncologist
p186
aVnamed David Agus.
p187
aVAnd Applied Minds gets a lot of calls
p188
aVfrom people who want help with their problems,
p189
aVand I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,
p190
aVso I kept on giving him to the delay list.
p191
aVAnd then one day,
p192
aVI get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman
p193
aVand Al Gore on the same day
p194
aVsaying return David Agus's phone call.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVSo I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful."
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVSo we started talking,
p199
aVand he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins."
p200
aVI'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.
p201
aVNot going to be easy."
p202
aVHe's like, "No, no. I really need it.
p203
aVI mean, I see patients dying every day
p204
aVbecause we don't know what's going on inside of them.
p205
aVWe have to have a window into this."
p206
aVAnd he took me through
p207
aVspecific examples of when he really needed it.
p208
aVAnd I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,
p209
aVif we could do it,
p210
aVand so I said, "Well, let's look at it."
p211
aa(lp212
VApplied Minds has enough play money
p213
aVthat we can go and just work on something
p214
aVwithout getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.
p215
aVSo we started playing around with this.
p216
aVAnd as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem \u2014
p217
aVthat taking the sip of coffee \u2014
p218
aVthat there were humans doing this complicated process
p219
aVand that what really needed to be done
p220
aVwas to automate this process like an assembly line
p221
aVand build robots
p222
aVthat would measure proteomics.
p223
aVAnd so we did that,
p224
aVand working with David,
p225
aVwe made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,
p226
aVwhich makes this robotic assembly line,
p227
aVwhich, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.
p228
aVAnd I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.
p229
aa(lp230
VBasically, what we do
p231
aVis we take a drop of blood
p232
aVout of a patient,
p233
aVand we sort out the proteins
p234
aVin the drop of blood
p235
aVaccording to how much they weigh,
p236
aVhow slippery they are,
p237
aVand we arrange them in an image.
p238
aVAnd so we can look at literally
p239
aVhundreds of thousands of features at once
p240
aVout of that drop of blood.
p241
aVAnd we can take a different one tomorrow,
p242
aVand you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different \u2014
p243
aVthey'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.
p244
aVThey really tell us what's going on there.
p245
aVAnd so this picture,
p246
aVwhich looks like a big smudge to you,
p247
aVis actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this
p248
aVand made me feel like we were on the right track.
p249
aVSo if I zoom into that picture,
p250
aVI can just show you what it means.
p251
aVWe sort out the proteins \u2014 from left to right
p252
aVis the weight of the fragments that we're getting,
p253
aVand from top to bottom is how slippery they are.
p254
aVSo we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.
p255
aVAnd so each of these lines
p256
aVrepresents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.
p257
aVAnd you can see how the lines occur
p258
aVin these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
p259
aVAnd that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that \u2014
p260
aVcarbon comes in different isotopes,
p261
aVso if it has an extra neutron on it,
p262
aVwe actually measure it as a different chemical.
p263
aVSo we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd so that gives you an idea
p266
aVof how exquisitely sensitive this is.
p267
aVSo seeing this picture
p268
aVis sort of like getting to be Galileo
p269
aVand looking at the stars
p270
aVand looking through the telescope for the first time,
p271
aVand suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."
p272
aVBut we can see that stuff out there
p273
aVand actually see features of it.
p274
aVSo this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.
p275
aVSo what we do with this
p276
aVis, for example, we can look at two patients,
p277
aVone that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,
p278
aVand ask, "What's going on differently
p279
aVinside of them?"
p280
aVAnd so we can make these measurements precisely enough
p281
aVthat we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo here we have Alice in green
p284
aVand Bob in red.
p285
aVWe overlay them. This is actual data.
p286
aVAnd you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,
p287
aVbut there's some things that just Alice has
p288
aVand some things that just Bob has.
p289
aVAnd if we find a pattern of things
p290
aVof the responders to the drug,
p291
aVwe see that in the blood,
p292
aVthey have the condition
p293
aVthat allows them to respond to this drug.
p294
aVWe might not even know what this protein is,
p295
aVbut we can see it's a marker
p296
aVfor the response to the disease.
p297
aVSo this already, I think,
p298
aVis tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.
p299
aVBut I think this is actually
p300
aVjust the beginning
p301
aVof how we're going to treat cancer.
p302
aVSo let me move to cancer.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe thing about cancer \u2014
p305
aVwhen I got into this,
p306
aVI really knew nothing about it,
p307
aVbut working with David Agus,
p308
aVI started watching how cancer was actually being treated
p309
aVand went to operations where it was being cut out.
p310
aVAnd as I looked at it,
p311
aVto me it didn't make sense
p312
aVhow we were approaching cancer,
p313
aVand in order to make sense of it,
p314
aVI had to learn where did this come from.
p315
aVWe're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.
p316
aVWe're treating it as something that got inside of you
p317
aVthat we have to kill.
p318
aVSo this is the great paradigm.
p319
aVThis is another case
p320
aVwhere a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked \u2014
p321
aVwas the germ theory of disease.
p322
aVSo what doctors are mostly trained to do
p323
aVis diagnose \u2014
p324
aVthat is, put you into a category
p325
aVand apply a scientifically proven treatment
p326
aVfor that diagnosis \u2014
p327
aVand that works great for infectious diseases.
p328
aVSo if we put you in the category
p329
aVof you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.
p330
aVWe know that that works.
p331
aVIf you've got malaria, we give you quinine
p332
aVor some derivative of it.
p333
aVAnd so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,
p334
aVand it's miraculous
p335
aVin the case of infectious disease \u2014
p336
aVhow well it works.
p337
aVAnd many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive
p338
aVif doctors didn't do this.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut now let's apply that
p341
aVto systems diseases like cancer.
p342
aVThe problem is that, in cancer,
p343
aVthere isn't something else
p344
aVthat's inside of you.
p345
aVIt's you; you're broken.
p346
aVThat conversation inside of you
p347
aVgot mixed up in some way.
p348
aVSo how do we diagnose that conversation?
p349
aVWell, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body \u2014
p350
aVyou know, where did it appear? \u2014
p351
aVand we put you in different categories
p352
aVaccording to the part of the body.
p353
aVAnd then we do a clinical trial
p354
aVfor a drug for lung cancer
p355
aVand one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,
p356
aVand we treat these as if they're separate diseases
p357
aVand that this way of dividing them
p358
aVhad something to do with what actually went wrong.
p359
aVAnd of course, it really doesn't have that much to do
p360
aVwith what went wrong
p361
aVbecause cancer is a failure of the system.
p362
aVAnd in fact, I think we're even wrong
p363
aVwhen we talk about cancer as a thing.
p364
aVI think this is the big mistake.
p365
aVI think cancer should not be a noun.
p366
aVWe should talk about cancering
p367
aVas something we do, not something we have.
p368
aVAnd so those tumors,
p369
aVthose are symptoms of cancer.
p370
aVAnd so your body is probably cancering all the time,
p371
aVbut there are lots of systems in your body
p372
aVthat keep it under control.
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd so to give you an idea
p375
aVof an analogy of what I mean
p376
aVby thinking of cancering as a verb,
p377
aVimagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,
p378
aVand the way that we talked about it,
p379
aVwe'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen
p380
aVand we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."
p381
aVWe might divide it \u2014 the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"
p382
aV"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."
p383
aVThat's kind of the level at which it is.
p384
aV"Kitchen water,
p385
aVwell, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.
p386
aVAnd then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,
p387
aVthat helps.
p388
aVWhereas living room water,
p389
aVit's better to do tar on the roof."
p390
aVAnd it sounds silly,
p391
aVbut that's basically what we do.
p392
aVAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,
p393
aVbut I'm saying that's not really the problem;
p394
aVthat's the symptom of the problem.
p395
aa(lp396
VWhat we really need to get at
p397
aVis the process that's going on,
p398
aVand that's happening at the level
p399
aVof the proteonomic actions,
p400
aVhappening at the level of why is your body not healing itself
p401
aVin the way that it normally does?
p402
aVBecause normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.
p403
aVSo your house is dealing with leaks all the time,
p404
aVbut it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.
p405
aVSo what we need
p406
aVis to have a causative model
p407
aVof what's actually going on,
p408
aVand proteomics actually gives us
p409
aVthe ability to build a model like that.
p410
aa(lp411
VDavid got me invited
p412
aVto give a talk at National Cancer Institute
p413
aVand Anna Barker was there.
p414
aVAnd so I gave this talk
p415
aVand said, "Why don't you guys do this?"
p416
aVAnd Anna said,
p417
aV"Because nobody within cancer
p418
aVwould look at it this way.
p419
aVBut what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program
p420
aVfor people outside the field of cancer
p421
aVto get together with doctors
p422
aVwho really know about cancer
p423
aVand work out different programs of research."
p424
aVSo David and I applied to this program
p425
aVand created a consortium
p426
aVat USC
p427
aVwhere we've got some of the best oncologists in the world
p428
aVand some of the best biologists in the world,
p429
aVfrom Cold Spring Harbor,
p430
aVStanford, Austin \u2014
p431
aVI won't even go through and name all the places \u2014
p432
aVto have a research project
p433
aVthat will last for five years
p434
aVwhere we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.
p435
aVWe're doing it in mice first,
p436
aVand we will kill a lot of mice
p437
aVin the process of doing this,
p438
aVbut they will die for a good cause.
p439
aVAnd we will actually try to get to the point
p440
aVwhere we have a predictive model
p441
aVwhere we can understand,
p442
aVwhen cancer happens,
p443
aVwhat's actually happening in there
p444
aVand which treatment will treat that cancer.
p445
aa(lp446
VSo let me just end with giving you a little picture
p447
aVof what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.
p448
aVSo I think eventually,
p449
aVonce we have one of these models for people,
p450
aVwhich we'll get eventually \u2014
p451
aVI mean, our group won't get all the way there \u2014
p452
aVbut eventually we'll have a very good computer model \u2014
p453
aVsort of like a global climate model for weather.
p454
aVIt has lots of different information
p455
aVabout what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation
p456
aVon many different scales.
p457
aVAnd so we will simulate
p458
aVin that model
p459
aVfor your particular cancer \u2014
p460
aVand this also will be for ALS,
p461
aVor any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,
p462
aVthings like that \u2014
p463
aVwe will simulate
p464
aVspecifically you,
p465
aVnot just a generic person,
p466
aVbut what's actually going on inside you.
p467
aa(lp468
VAnd in that simulation, what we could do
p469
aVis design for you specifically
p470
aVa sequence of treatments,
p471
aVand it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.
p472
aVIt might be things like, don't eat that day,
p473
aVor give them a little chemotherapy,
p474
aVmaybe a little radiation.
p475
aVOf course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.
p476
aVBut design a program of treatments specifically for you
p477
aVand help your body
p478
aVguide back to health \u2014
p479
aVguide your body back to health.
p480
aVBecause your body will do most of the work of fixing it
p481
aVif we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.
p482
aVWe put it in the equivalent of splints.
p483
aVAnd so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms
p484
aVfor fixing cancer,
p485
aVand we just have to prop those up in the right way
p486
aVand get them to do the job.
p487
aa(lp488
VAnd so I believe that this will be the way
p489
aVthat cancer will be treated in the future.
p490
aVIt's going to require a lot of work,
p491
aVa lot of research.
p492
aVThere will be many teams like our team
p493
aVthat work on this.
p494
aVBut I think eventually,
p495
aVwe will design for everybody
p496
aVa custom treatment for cancer.
