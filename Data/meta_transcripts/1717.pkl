VOne of the things I want to establish right from the start
p4
aVis that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.
p5
aVI just wanted you to know that.
p6
aa(lp7
VSo I am indeed a neurosurgeon,
p8
aVand I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,
p9
aVand what I'm going to tell you about today
p10
aVis adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,
p11
aVbeing able to go anywhere in the brain
p12
aVand turning areas of the brain up or down
p13
aVto help our patients.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.
p16
aVIt's been around for about 7,000 years.
p17
aVIn Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,
p18
aVand there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.
p19
aVAnd they were trying to \u2014 they knew that the brain was involved
p20
aVin neurological and psychiatric disease.
p21
aVThey didn't know exactly what they were doing.
p22
aVNot much has changed, by the way. (Laughter)
p23
aVBut they thought that,
p24
aVif you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,
p25
aVit must be because you are possessed
p26
aVby an evil spirit.
p27
aVSo if you are possessed by an evil spirit
p28
aVcausing neurologic or psychiatric problems,
p29
aVthen the way to treat this is, of course,
p30
aVto make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo this was the thinking back then,
p33
aVand these individuals made these holes.
p34
aVSometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant
p35
aVto go through this because, you can tell that
p36
aVthe holes are made partially and then, I think,
p37
aVthere was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly
p38
aVand it was only a partial hole,
p39
aVand we know they survived these procedures.
p40
aVBut this was common.
p41
aVThere were some sites where one percent
p42
aVof all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see
p43
aVthat neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,
p44
aVand it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, in the course of time,
p47
aVwe've come to realize that
p48
aVdifferent parts of the brain do different things.
p49
aVSo there are areas of the brain that are dedicated
p50
aVto controlling your movement or your vision
p51
aVor your memory or your appetite, and so on.
p52
aVAnd when things work well, then the nervous system
p53
aVworks well, and everything functions.
p54
aVBut once in a while, things don't go so well,
p55
aVand there's trouble in these circuits,
p56
aVand there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring
p57
aVand causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive
p58
aVand they're not quite working as they should.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, the manifestation of this
p61
aVdepends on where in the brain these neurons are.
p62
aVSo when these neurons are in the motor circuit,
p63
aVyou get dysfunction in the movement system,
p64
aVand you get things like Parkinson's disease.
p65
aVWhen the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,
p66
aVyou get things like depression,
p67
aVand when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,
p68
aVthen you get things like Alzheimer's disease.
p69
aVSo what we've been able to do is to pinpoint
p70
aVwhere these disturbances are in the brain,
p71
aVand we've been able to intervene within these circuits
p72
aVin the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.
p73
aVSo this is very much like choosing the correct station
p74
aVon the radio dial.
p75
aVOnce you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,
p76
aVin our case whether it be movement or mood,
p77
aVwe can put the dial there,
p78
aVand then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,
p79
aVto turn it up or turn it down.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo what I'm going to tell you about
p82
aVis using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes
p83
aVand turning areas of the brain up and down
p84
aVto see if we can help our patients.
p85
aVAnd this is accomplished using this kind of device,
p86
aVand this is called deep brain stimulation.
p87
aVSo what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.
p88
aVAgain, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,
p89
aVputting an electrode in, and then this electrode
p90
aVis completely underneath the skin
p91
aVdown to a pacemaker in the chest,
p92
aVand with a remote control very much like a television remote control,
p93
aVwe can adjust how much electricity we deliver
p94
aVto these areas of the brain.
p95
aVWe can turn it up or down, on or off.
p96
aVNow, about a hundred thousand patients in the world
p97
aVhave received deep brain stimulation,
p98
aVand I'm going to show you some examples
p99
aVof using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,
p100
aVdisorders of mood and disorders of cognition.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo this looks something like this when it's in the brain.
p103
aVYou see the electrode going through the skull into the brain
p104
aVand resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.
p105
aVI tell my friends that no neuron is safe
p106
aVfrom a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach
p107
aVjust about anywhere in the brain quite safely now.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow the first example I'm going to show you is a patient
p110
aVwith Parkinson's disease,
p111
aVand this lady has Parkinson's disease,
p112
aVand she has these electrodes in her brain,
p113
aVand I'm going to show you what she's like
p114
aVwhen the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,
p115
aVand then we're going to turn it on.
p116
aVSo this looks something like this.
p117
aVThe electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.
p118
aV(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?
p119
aV(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.
p120
aVWe're now going to turn it on.
p121
aVIt's on. Just turned it on.
p122
aVAnd this works like that, instantly.
p123
aVAnd the difference between shaking in this way and not \u2014
p124
aV(Applause)
p125
aVThe difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior
p126
aVof 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.
p127
aVSo we now know how to find these troublemakers
p128
aVand tell them, "Gentlemen, that's enough.
p129
aVWe want you to stop doing that."
p130
aVAnd we do that with electricity.
p131
aVSo we use electricity to dictate how they fire,
p132
aVand we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.
p133
aVSo in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons.
p134
aa(lp135
VWe started using this technique in other problems,
p136
aVand I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem
p137
aVthat we encountered, a case of dystonia.
p138
aVSo dystonia is a disorder affecting children.
p139
aVIt's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,
p140
aVand these children get progressively more and more twisting
p141
aVuntil they can't breathe, until they get sores,
p142
aVurinary infections, and then they die.
p143
aVSo back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,
p144
aVperfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.
p145
aVThere are eight children in the family.
p146
aVFive of them have dystonia.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo here he is.
p149
aVThis boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,
p150
aVand then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,
p151
aVthen the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,
p152
aVthen the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,
p153
aVwithin the course of one or two years of the disease onset,
p154
aVhe could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.
p155
aVHe was crippled, and indeed the natural progression
p156
aVas this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,
p157
aVprogressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.
p158
aVSo he is one of five kids.
p159
aVThe only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.
p160
aVHe did not respond to any drugs.
p161
aVWe did not know what to do with this boy.
p162
aVWe did not know what operation to do,
p163
aVwhere to go in the brain,
p164
aVbut on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,
p165
aVwe reasoned, why don't we try to suppress
p166
aVthe same area in the brain that we suppressed
p167
aVin Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?
p168
aVSo here he was. We operated on him
p169
aVhoping that he would get better. We did not know.
p170
aVSo here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,
p171
aVthree months after the procedure, and here he is.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VOn the basis of this result, this is now a procedure
p176
aVthat's done throughout the world,
p177
aVand there have been hundreds of children
p178
aVthat have been helped with this kind of surgery.
p179
aVThis boy is now in university
p180
aVand leads quite a normal life.
p181
aVThis has been one of the most satisfying cases
p182
aVthat I have ever done in my entire career,
p183
aVto restore movement and walking to this kind of child.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VWe realized that perhaps we could use this technology
p188
aVnot only in circuits that control your movement
p189
aVbut also circuits that control other things,
p190
aVand the next thing that we took on
p191
aVwas circuits that control your mood.
p192
aVAnd we decided to take on depression,
p193
aVand the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,
p194
aVand as you know, there are many treatments for depression,
p195
aVwith medication and psychotherapy,
p196
aVeven electroconvulsive therapy,
p197
aVbut there are millions of people,
p198
aVand there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression
p199
aVthat do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.
p200
aVAnd let's see if we can use this technique
p201
aVto help these patients with depression.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo the first thing we did was, we compared,
p204
aVwhat's different in the brain of someone with depression
p205
aVand someone who is normal,
p206
aVand what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,
p207
aVand what we noticed is that in patients with depression
p208
aVcompared to normals,
p209
aVareas of the brain are shut down,
p210
aVand those are the areas in blue.
p211
aVSo here you really have the blues,
p212
aVand the areas in blue are areas that are involved
p213
aVin motivation, in drive and decision-making,
p214
aVand indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,
p215
aVthose are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.
p216
aVThe other thing we discovered
p217
aVwas an area that was overactive, area 25,
p218
aVseen there in red,
p219
aVand area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.
p220
aVIf I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember
p221
aVthe last time you saw your parent before they died
p222
aVor a friend before they died,
p223
aVthis area of the brain lights up.
p224
aVIt is the sadness center of the brain.
p225
aVAnd so patients with depression have hyperactivity.
p226
aVThe area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.
p227
aVThe thermostat is set at 100 degrees,
p228
aVand the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.
p229
aVSo we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness
p230
aVand see if we can turn down the thermostat,
p231
aVcan we turn down the activity,
p232
aVand what will be the consequence of that?
p233
aa(lp234
VSo we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.
p235
aVThis is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.
p236
aVAnd we placed electrodes in area 25,
p237
aVand in the top scan you see before the operation,
p238
aVarea 25, the sadness area is red hot,
p239
aVand the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,
p240
aVand then, after three months of continuous stimulation,
p241
aV24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation,
p242
aVwe have a complete reversal of this.
p243
aVWe're able to drive down area 25,
p244
aVdown to a more normal level,
p245
aVand we're able to turn back online
p246
aVthe frontal lobes of the brain,
p247
aVand indeed we're seeing very striking results
p248
aVin these patients with severe depression.
p249
aVSo now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,
p250
aVand this may become a new procedure,
p251
aVif it's safe and we find that it's effective,
p252
aVto treat patients with severe depression.
p253
aa(lp254
VI've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation
p255
aVto treat the motor system
p256
aVin cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.
p257
aVI've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit
p258
aVin cases of depression.
p259
aVCan we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVAnybody interested in that?
p262
aV(Applause)
p263
aVOf course we can, right?
p264
aa(lp265
VSo what we've decided to do is
p266
aVwe're going to try to turbocharge
p267
aVthe memory circuits in the brain.
p268
aVWe're going to place electrodes within the circuits
p269
aVthat regulate your memory and cognitive function
p270
aVto see if we can turn up their activity.
p271
aVNow we're not going to do this in normal people.
p272
aVWe're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,
p273
aVand we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease
p274
aVwho have cognitive and memory deficits.
p275
aVAs you know, this is the main symptom
p276
aVof early onset Alzheimer's disease.
p277
aVSo we've placed electrodes within this circuit
p278
aVin an area of the brain called the fornix,
p279
aVwhich is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,
p280
aVwith the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,
p281
aVand whether that can, in turn, help these patients
p282
aVwith Alzheimer's disease.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,
p285
aVthere's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.
p286
aVThe brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.
p287
aVIt uses 20 percent of all your \u2014
p288
aVeven though it only weighs two percent \u2014
p289
aVit uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.
p290
aVTwenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,
p291
aVand as you go from being normal
p292
aVto having mild cognitive impairment,
p293
aVwhich is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,
p294
aVthen there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.
p295
aVThey shut down. They turn off.
p296
aVAnd indeed, what we see is that these areas in red
p297
aVaround the outside ribbon of the brain
p298
aVare progressively getting more and more blue
p299
aVuntil they shut down completely.
p300
aVThis is analogous to having a power failure
p301
aVin an area of the brain, a regional power failure.
p302
aVSo the lights are out in parts of the brain
p303
aVin patients with Alzheimer's disease,
p304
aVand the question is, are the lights out forever,
p305
aVor can we turn the lights back on?
p306
aVCan we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again?
p307
aa(lp308
VSo this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix
p309
aVof patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,
p310
aVand we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.
p311
aVAnd indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,
p312
aVthe areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,
p313
aVpredominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.
p314
aVThese areas of the brain are shut down.
p315
aVThe lights are out in these areas of the brain.
p316
aVWe then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month
p317
aVor a year, and the areas in red
p318
aVrepresent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.
p319
aVAnd indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain
p320
aVthat were not using glucose to use glucose once again.
p321
aVSo the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,
p322
aVthe lights are out, but there is someone home,
p323
aVand we're able to turn the power back on
p324
aVto these areas of the brain, and as we do so,
p325
aVwe expect that their functions will return.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo this is now in clinical trials.
p328
aVWe are going to operate on 50 patients
p329
aVwith early Alzheimer's disease
p330
aVto see whether this is safe and effective,
p331
aVwhether we can improve their neurologic function.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Applause)
p334
aa(lp335
VSo the message I want to leave you with today is that,
p336
aVindeed, there are several circuits in the brain
p337
aVthat are malfunctioning across various disease states,
p338
aVwhether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,
p339
aVdepression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.
p340
aVWe are now learning to understand what are the circuits,
p341
aVwhat are the areas of the brain that are responsible for
p342
aVthe clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.
p343
aVWe can now reach those circuits.
p344
aVWe can introduce electrodes within those circuits.
p345
aVWe can graduate the activity of those circuits.
p346
aVWe can turn them down if they are overactive,
p347
aVif they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,
p348
aVor we can turn them up if they are underperforming,
p349
aVand in so doing, we think that we may be able to help
p350
aVthe overall function of the brain.
p351
aa(lp352
VThe implications of this, of course, is that we may be able
p353
aVto modify the symptoms of the disease,
p354
aVbut I haven't told you but there's also some evidence
p355
aVthat we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,
p356
aVand this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,
p357
aVwe not only change the activity but also
p358
aVsome of the reparative functions of the brain
p359
aVcan be harvested.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo I envision that we're going to see a great expansion
p362
aVof indications of this technique.
p363
aVWe're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.
p364
aVOne of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,
p365
aVit involves multidisciplinary work.
p366
aVIt involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,
p367
aVof basic scientists, of neurologists,
p368
aVpsychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface
p369
aVof these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.
p370
aVAnd I think that we will see that
p371
aVwe will be able to chase more of these evil spirits
p372
aVout from the brain as time goes on,
p373
aVand the consequence of that, of course, will be
p374
aVthat we will be able to help many more patients.
p375
