aa(lp5
VMy dear fellow citizen:
p6
aa(lp7
VI write to you today,
p8
aVto you who have lost in this era.
p9
aVAt this moment in our common life,
p10
aVwhen the world is full of breaking
p11
aVand spite
p12
aVand fear,
p13
aa(lp14
VI address this letter
p15
aVsimply to you,
p16
aVeven though we both know
p17
aVthere are many of you behind this "you,"
p18
aVand many of me behind this "I."
p19
aa(lp20
VI write to you because at present,
p21
aVthis quaking world we share scares me.
p22
aVI gather it scares you, too.
p23
aVSome of what we fear, I suspect,
p24
aVwe fear in common.
p25
aVBut much of what we fear seems to be each other.
p26
aVYou fear the world I want to live in,
p27
aVand I fear your visions in turn.
p28
aa(lp29
VDo you know that feeling you get when you know it's going to storm
p30
aVbefore it storms?
p31
aVDo you also feel that now,
p32
aVfellow citizen?
p33
aVThat malaise and worry
p34
aVthat some who know
p35
aVfeel reminds them of the 1930s?
p36
aa(lp37
VPerhaps you don't,
p38
aVbecause our fears of each other
p39
aVare not in sync.
p40
aVIn this round, I sense that your fears of me,
p41
aVof the world that I have insisted is right for us both,
p42
aVhas gathered over a generation.
p43
aVIt took time for your fears to trigger my fears,
p44
aVnot least because at first,
p45
aVI never thought I needed to fear you.
p46
aa(lp47
VI heard you
p48
aVbut did not listen,
p49
aVall these years when you said that this amazing new world
p50
aVwasn't amazing for you,
p51
aVfor many of you,
p52
aVacross the industrialized world;
p53
aVthat the open, liquid world I relished,
p54
aVof people and goods and technologies flowing freely,
p55
aVgoing where they pleased, globally,
p56
aVwas not, for you, an emancipation.
p57
aa(lp58
VI have walked through your towns
p59
aVand, while looking, failed to see.
p60
aVI did notice in Stephenville, Texas,
p61
aVthat the town square was dominated
p62
aVby one lawyer's office after another,
p63
aVbecause of all the people rotating in and out of the prison.
p64
aVI did notice the barren shops in Wagner, South Dakota,
p65
aVand the VFW gathering hall
p66
aVthat stood in mockery
p67
aVof a community's dream to endure.
p68
aVI did notice
p69
aVat the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,
p70
aVthat far too many people in their 20s and 30s
p71
aVlooked a decade or two from death,
p72
aVwith patchy, flared-up skin
p73
aVand thinning, stringy hair
p74
aVand browning, ground-down teeth
p75
aVand a lostness in their eyes.
p76
aa(lp77
VI did notice that the young people I encountered in Paris,
p78
aVin Florence, in Barcelona,
p79
aVhad degrees but no place to take them,
p80
aVliving on internships well into their 30s,
p81
aVtheir lives prevented from launching,
p82
aVbecause of an economy that creates wealth \u2014
p83
aVjust not jobs.
p84
aVI did notice the news about those parts of London becoming ghost quarters,
p85
aVwhere the global super-rich turn fishy money into empty apartments
p86
aVand price lifelong residents of a city, young couples starting out,
p87
aVout of their own home.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I heard that the fabric of your life
p90
aVwas tearing.
p91
aVYou used to be able to count on work,
p92
aVand now you couldn't.
p93
aVYou used to be able to nourish your children,
p94
aVand guarantee that they would climb
p95
aVa little bit further in life than you had,
p96
aVand now you couldn't.
p97
aVYou used to be made to feel dignity in your work, and now you didn't.
p98
aVIt used to be normal for people like you to own a home,
p99
aVand now it wasn't.
p100
aa(lp101
VI cannot say
p102
aVI didn't know these things,
p103
aVbut I was distracted
p104
aVcreating a future in which we could live on Mars,
p105
aVeven as you struggled down here on Earth.
p106
aVI was distracted
p107
aVinnovating immortality,
p108
aVeven as many of you began to live shorter lives than your parents had.
p109
aa(lp110
VI heard all of these things, but I didn't listen.
p111
aVI looked
p112
aVbut didn't see.
p113
aVI read, didn't understand.
p114
aa(lp115
VI paid attention
p116
aVonly when you began to vote and shout,
p117
aVand when your voting and shouting, when the substance of it,
p118
aVbegan to threaten me.
p119
aa(lp120
VI listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions
p121
aVand electing vulgar demagogues.
p122
aa(lp123
VOnly then did your pain become of interest
p124
aVto me.
p125
aa(lp126
VI know that feeling hurt
p127
aVis often prologue to dealing hurt.
p128
aVI wonder now
p129
aVif you would be less eager to deal it
p130
aVif I had stood with you
p131
aVwhen you merely felt it.
p132
aa(lp133
VI ask myself
p134
aVwhy I didn't stand with you then.
p135
aa(lp136
VOne reason is that I became entranced
p137
aVby the gurus of change,
p138
aVbecame a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty's sake,
p139
aVand of globalization and open borders
p140
aVand kaleidoscopic diversity.
p141
aa(lp142
VOnce change became my totalizing faith,
p143
aVI could be blind.
p144
aVI could fail to see change's consequences.
p145
aVI could overlook the importance
p146
aVof roots, traditions, rituals, stability \u2014
p147
aVand belonging.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd the more fundamentalist I became
p150
aVin my worship of change and openness,
p151
aVthe more I drove you towards the other polarity,
p152
aVto cling,
p153
aVto freeze,
p154
aVto close,
p155
aVto belong.
p156
aa(lp157
VI now see as I didn't before
p158
aVthat not having the right skin or right organ
p159
aVis not the only varietal of disadvantage.
p160
aVThere is a subtler, quieter disadvantage
p161
aVin having those privileged traits
p162
aVand yet feeling history to be moving away from you;
p163
aVthat while the past was hospitable to people like you,
p164
aVthe future will be more hospitable
p165
aVto others;
p166
aVthat the world is growing less familiar,
p167
aVless yours day by day.
p168
aa(lp169
VI will not concede for a moment that old privileges should not dwindle.
p170
aVThey cannot dwindle fast enough.
p171
aVIt is for you to learn to live in a new century in which
p172
aVthere are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs.
p173
aVIf and when your anger turns to hate,
p174
aVplease know that there is no space for that in our shared home.
p175
aVBut I will admit, fellow citizen,
p176
aVthat I have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status.
p177
aVI have forgotten
p178
aVthat what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling.
p179
aa(lp180
VA similar thing happened
p181
aVwith the economy that you and I share.
p182
aVJust as I cannot and don't wish
p183
aVto turn back to the clock on equality and diversity,
p184
aVand yet must understand
p185
aVthe sense of loss they can inspire,
p186
aVso, too, I refuse and could not if I wished
p187
aVturn back the clock on an ever more closely knit, interdependent world,
p188
aVand on inventions that won't stop being invented.
p189
aVAnd yet I must understand your experience of these things.
p190
aa(lp191
VYou have for years been telling me that your experience of these things
p192
aVis not as good as my theories forecast.
p193
aa(lp194
VYet before you could finish a complaining sentence
p195
aVabout the difficulty of living with erratic hours, volatile pay,
p196
aVvanishing opportunities,
p197
aVabout the pain of dropping your children off at 24-hour day care
p198
aVto make your 3am shift,
p199
aVI shot back at you \u2014 before you could finish your sentence \u2014
p200
aVmy dogma,
p201
aVabout how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility
p202
aVand freedom.
p203
aa(lp204
VLanguage is one of the only things that we truly share,
p205
aVand I sometimes used this joint inheritance
p206
aVto obfuscate
p207
aVand deflect
p208
aVand justify myself;
p209
aVto re-brand what was good for me
p210
aVas something appearing good for us both,
p211
aVwhen I threw around terms like "the sharing economy,"
p212
aVand "disruption"
p213
aVand "global resourcing."
p214
aa(lp215
VI see now that what I was really doing,
p216
aVat times,
p217
aVwas buying your pain on the cheap,
p218
aVsprucing it up
p219
aVand trying to sell it back to you
p220
aVas freedom.
p221
aa(lp222
VI have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe
p223
aVthat the system that has been good to me,
p224
aVthat has made my life ever more seamless,
p225
aVis also the best system for you.
p226
aa(lp227
VI have condescended to you
p228
aVwith the idea that you are voting against your economic interests \u2014
p229
aVvoting against your interests,
p230
aVas if I know your interests.
p231
aVThat is just my dogmatic economism talking.
p232
aVI have a weakness
p233
aVfor treating people's economic interests as their only interest,
p234
aVignoring things like belonging and pride
p235
aVand the desire to send a message to those who ignore you.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo here we are,
p238
aVin a scary but not inexplicable moment
p239
aVof demagoguery, fracture,
p240
aVxenophobia, resentment and fear.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd I worry for us both if we continue down this road,
p243
aVme not listening,
p244
aVyou feeling unheard,
p245
aVyou shouting to get me to listen.
p246
aa(lp247
VI worry when each of us is seduced by visions of the future
p248
aVthat have no place for the other.
p249
aa(lp250
VIf this goes on,
p251
aVif this goes on,
p252
aVthere may be blood.
p253
aVThere are already hints of this blood
p254
aVin newspapers every day.
p255
aVThere may be roundups, raids,
p256
aVdeportations, camps, secessions.
p257
aVAnd no, I do not think that I exaggerate.
p258
aVThere may be even talk of war
p259
aVin places that were certain they were done with it.
p260
aa(lp261
VThere is always the hope of redemption.
p262
aVBut it will not be a cheap, shallow redemption
p263
aVthat comes through blather about us all being in it together.
p264
aVThis will take more.
p265
aa(lp266
VIt will take accepting that we both made choices to be here.
p267
aa(lp268
VWe create our "others."
p269
aVAs parents, as neighbors, as citizens,
p270
aVwe witness and sometimes ignore each other
p271
aVinto being.
p272
aa(lp273
VYou were not born vengeful.
p274
aVI have some role
p275
aVin whatever thirst you now feel for revenge,
p276
aVand that thirst now tempts me
p277
aVto plot ever more elaborate escapes
p278
aVfrom our common life,
p279
aVfrom the schools and neighborhoods
p280
aVand airports and amusement parks
p281
aVthat we used to share.
p282
aa(lp283
VWe face, then,
p284
aVa problem not of these large, impersonal forces.
p285
aVWe face a problem of your and my relations.
p286
aVWe chose ways of relating to each other
p287
aVthat got us here.
p288
aVWe can choose ways of relating
p289
aVthat get us out.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut there are things we might have to let go of,
p292
aVfellow citizen,
p293
aVstarting with our own cherished versions of reality.
p294
aa(lp295
VImagine if you let go of fantasies
p296
aVof a society purged of these or those people.
p297
aVImagine if I let go of my habit
p298
aVof saving the world behind your back,
p299
aVof deliberating on the future
p300
aVof your work,
p301
aVyour food,
p302
aVyour schools,
p303
aVin places where you couldn't get past security.
p304
aa(lp305
VWe can do this only if we first accept
p306
aVthat we have neglected each other.
p307
aVIf there is hope to summon
p308
aVin this ominous hour,
p309
aVit is this.
p310
aVWe have, for too long,
p311
aVchased various shimmering dreams
p312
aVat the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other,
p313
aVthe dream of tending to each other,
p314
aVof unleashing each other's wonders,
p315
aVof moving through history together.
p316
aVWe could dare to commit to the dream of each other
p317
aVas the thing that matters before every neon thing.
p318
aa(lp319
VLet us dare.
p320
aa(lp321
VSincerely yours,
p322
aa(lp323
Va fellow citizen.
