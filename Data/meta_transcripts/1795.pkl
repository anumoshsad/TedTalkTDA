VSo if I was to ask you
p4
aVwhat the connection between
p5
aVa bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,
p6
aVyou'd probably think that's the easiest question
p7
aVthat you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week.
p8
aVBut if I was to say that they're both examples
p9
aVof alternative or new forms of currency
p10
aVin a hyperconnected, data-driven global economy,
p11
aVyou'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers.
p12
aVBut trust me, I work in advertising.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I am going to tell you the answer,
p17
aVbut obviously after this short break.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo a more challenging question is one
p20
aVthat I was asked, actually, by one of our writers
p21
aVa couple of weeks ago, and I didn't know the answer:
p22
aVWhat's the world's best performing currency?
p23
aVIt's actually Bitcoin.
p24
aVNow, for those of you who may not be familiar,
p25
aVBitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual currency, synthetic currency.
p26
aVIt was founded in 2008 by this anonymous programmer
p27
aVusing a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
p28
aVNo one knows who or what he is.
p29
aVHe's almost like the Banksy of the Internet.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd I'm probably not going to do it proper service here,
p32
aVbut my interpretation of how it works is that
p33
aVBitcoins are released through this process of mining.
p34
aVSo there's a network of computers that are challenged
p35
aVto solve a very complex mathematical problem
p36
aVand the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins.
p37
aVAnd the Bitcoins are released,
p38
aVthey're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain,
p39
aVand then they float, so they become a currency,
p40
aVand completely decentralized, that's the sort of
p41
aVscary thing about this, which is why it's so popular.
p42
aVSo it's not run by the authorities or the state.
p43
aVIt's actually managed by the network.
p44
aVAnd the reason that it's proved very successful
p45
aVis it's private, it's anonymous, it's fast, and it's cheap.
p46
aVAnd you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.
p47
aVSo in one level it went from something like 13 dollars
p48
aVto 266, literally in the space of four months,
p49
aVand then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours.
p50
aVAnd it's currently around that kind of
p51
aV110 dollar mark in value.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground,
p54
aVit's gaining respectability.
p55
aVYou get services, like Reddit and Wordpress
p56
aVare actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now.
p57
aVAnd that's showing you that people
p58
aVare actually placing trust in technology,
p59
aVand it's started to trump and disrupt
p60
aVand interrogate traditional institutions
p61
aVand how we think about currencies and money.
p62
aVAnd that's not surprising, if you think about
p63
aVthe basket case that is the E.U.
p64
aVI think there was a Gallup survey out recently
p65
aVthat said something like, in America,
p66
aVtrust in banks is at an all-time low, it's something like 21 percent.
p67
aVAnd you can see here some photographs from London
p68
aVwhere Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme,
p69
aVand some activists have done some nice piece
p70
aVof guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.
p71
aV"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclays takes you for a ride."
p72
aVThese are the more polite ones I could share with you today.
p73
aVBut you get the gist, so people have really started
p74
aVto sort of lose faith in institutions.
p75
aa(lp76
VThere's a P.R. company called Edelman,
p77
aVthey do this very interesting survey every year
p78
aVprecisely around trust and what people are thinking.
p79
aVAnd this is a global survey, so these numbers are global.
p80
aVAnd what's interesting is that you can see that
p81
aVhierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,
p82
aVand it's all about heterarchical now,
p83
aVso people trust people like themselves more
p84
aVthan they trust corporations and governments.
p85
aVAnd if you look at these figures for the more developed markets
p86
aVlike U.K., Germany, and so on, they're actually much lower.
p87
aVAnd I find that sort of scary.
p88
aVPeople are actually trusting businesspeople
p89
aVmore than they're trusting governments and leaders.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what's starting to happen, if you think about money,
p92
aVif you sort of boil money down to an essence,
p93
aVit is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value.
p94
aVSo what's happening now, in the digital age,
p95
aVis that we can quantify value in lots of different ways
p96
aVand do it more easily,
p97
aVand sometimes the way that we quantify those values,
p98
aVit makes it much easier
p99
aVto create new forms and valid forms of currency.
p100
aVIn that context, you can see that networks like Bitcoin
p101
aVsuddenly start to make a bit more sense.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo if you think we're starting to question
p104
aVand disrupt and interrogate what money means,
p105
aVwhat our relationship with it is, what defines money,
p106
aVthen the ultimate extension of that is,
p107
aVis there a reason for the government to be in charge
p108
aVof money anymore?
p109
aVSo obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism,
p110
aVso from a brand perspective,
p111
aVbrands literally stand or fall on their reputations.
p112
aVAnd if you think about it, reputation has now become a currency.
p113
aVYou know, reputations are built on trust,
p114
aVconsistency, transparency.
p115
aVSo if you've actually decided that you trust a brand,
p116
aVyou want a relationship, you want to engage with the brand,
p117
aVyou're already kind of participating in lots of new forms
p118
aVof currency.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo you think about loyalty.
p121
aVLoyalty essentially is a micro-economy.
p122
aVYou think about rewards schemes, air miles.
p123
aVThe Economist said a few years ago that
p124
aVthere are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world
p125
aVthan there are dollar bills in circulation.
p126
aVYou know, when you are standing in line in Starbucks,
p127
aV30 percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day
p128
aVare actually being made with Starbucks Star points.
p129
aVSo that's a sort of Starbucks currency
p130
aVstaying within its ecosystem.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd what I find interesting is that Amazon
p133
aVhas recently launched Amazon coins.
p134
aVSo admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle.
p135
aVSo you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps,
p136
aVbut you think about Amazon,
p137
aVyou look at the trust barometer that I showed you
p138
aVwhere people are starting to trust businesses,
p139
aVespecially businesses that they believe in and trust
p140
aVmore than governments.
p141
aVSo suddenly, you start thinking,
p142
aVwell Amazon potentially could push this.
p143
aVIt could become a natural extension,
p144
aVthat as well as buying stuff \u2014
p145
aVtake it out of the Kindle \u2014 you could buy books, music,
p146
aVreal-life products, appliances and goods and so on.
p147
aVAnd suddenly you're getting Amazon, as a brand,
p148
aVis going head to head with the Federal Reserve
p149
aVin terms of how you want to spend your money,
p150
aVwhat money is, what constitutes money.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd I'll get you back to Tide, the detergent now,
p153
aVas I promised.
p154
aVThis is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine,
p155
aVwhere it was saying that drug users across America
p156
aVare actually purchasing drugs
p157
aVwith bottles of Tide detergent.
p158
aVSo they're going into convenience stores,
p159
aVstealing Tide,
p160
aVand a $20 bottle of Tide
p161
aVis equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed.
p162
aVAnd what they're saying, so some criminologists
p163
aVhave looked at this and they're saying, well, okay,
p164
aVTide as a product sells at a premium.
p165
aVIt's 50 percent above the category average.
p166
aVIt's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals,
p167
aVso it smells very luxurious and very distinctive,
p168
aVand, being a Procter and Gamble brand,
p169
aVit's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising.
p170
aVSo what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too,
p171
aVso they have this in their neural pathways.
p172
aVWhen they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.
p173
aVThey say, that is trust. I trust that. That's quality.
p174
aVSo it becomes this unit of currency,
p175
aVwhich the New York Magazine described
p176
aVas a very oddly loyal crime wave, brand-loyal crime wave,
p177
aVand criminals are actually calling Tide "liquid gold."
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, what I thought was funny was the reaction
p180
aVfrom the P&G spokesperson.
p181
aVThey said, obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs,
p182
aVbut said, "It reminds me of one thing
p183
aVand that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent." (Laughter)
p184
aVWhich backs up my point and shows he didn't even
p185
aVbreak a sweat when he said that.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo that brings me back to the connection with sweat.
p188
aVIn Mexico, Nike has run a campaign recently
p189
aVcalled, literally, Bid Your Sweat.
p190
aVSo you think about,
p191
aVthese Nike shoes have got sensors in them,
p192
aVor you're using a Nike FuelBand
p193
aVthat basically tracks your movement, your energy,
p194
aVyour calorie consumption.
p195
aVAnd what's happening here, this is where you've actually
p196
aVelected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it.
p197
aVThey're not advertising loud messages at you,
p198
aVand that's where advertising has started to shift now
p199
aVis into things like services, tools and applications.
p200
aVSo Nike is literally acting as a well-being partner,
p201
aVa health and fitness partner and service provider.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo what happens with this is they're saying, "Right,
p204
aVyou have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run,
p205
aVhow far you've moved, what your calorie intake, all that sort of stuff.
p206
aVWhat you can do is, the more you run, the more points you get,
p207
aVand we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff
p208
aVbut only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff."
p209
aVAnd you can't come into this. This is purely
p210
aVfor the community that are sweating
p211
aVusing Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos.
p212
aVThis is literally a closed environment, a closed auction space.
p213
aa(lp214
VIn Africa, you know, airtime has become
p215
aVliterally a currency in its own right.
p216
aVPeople are used to, because mobile is king,
p217
aVthey're very, very used to transferring money,
p218
aVmaking payments via mobile.
p219
aVAnd one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective
p220
aVgoing on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,
p221
aVlots of people make purchases in markets
p222
aVand very small independent stores.
p223
aVLoose change, small change is a real problem,
p224
aVand what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff,
p225
aVyou're due, say,
p226
aV10 cents, 20 cents in change.
p227
aVThe shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion
p228
aVor an aspirin, or a piece of gum,
p229
aVbecause they don't have small change.
p230
aVSo when Vodafone came in and saw this problem,
p231
aVthis consumer pain point, they created
p232
aVsome small change which they call Fakka,
p233
aVwhich literally sits and is given
p234
aVby the shopkeepers to people,
p235
aVand it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone.
p236
aVSo this currency becomes credit, which again,
p237
aVis really, really interesting.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd we did a survey that backs up the fact that,
p240
aVyou know, 45 percent of people
p241
aVin this very crucial demographic in the U.S.
p242
aVwere saying that they're comfortable using
p243
aVan independent or branded currency.
p244
aVSo that's getting really interesting here,
p245
aVa really interesting dynamic going on.
p246
aVAnd you think, corporations
p247
aVshould start taking their assets and thinking of them
p248
aVin a different way and trading them.
p249
aVAnd you think, is it much of a leap?
p250
aVIt seems farfetched, but when you think about it,
p251
aVin America in 1860,
p252
aVthere were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes.
p253
aVThere were 8,000 kinds of notes in America.
p254
aVAnd the only thing that stopped that,
p255
aVthe government controlled four percent of the supply,
p256
aVand the only thing that stopped it
p257
aVwas the Civil War breaking out,
p258
aVand the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money.
p259
aVSo government, money, war, nothing changes there, then.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo what I'm going to ask is, basically,
p262
aVis history repeating itself?
p263
aVIs technology making paper money feel outmoded?
p264
aVAre we decoupling money from the government?
p265
aVYou know, you think about, brands are starting to fill the gaps.
p266
aVCorporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill.
p267
aVSo I think, you know, will we be standing on stage
p268
aVbuying a coffee \u2014 organic, fair trade coffee \u2014 next year
p269
aVusing TED florins or TED shillings?
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you very much.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you. (Applause)
