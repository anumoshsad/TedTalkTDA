VThe first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all
p4
aVlove music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
p5
aVBut music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
p6
aVSo, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect \u2014
p7
aVthe idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years \u2014
p8
aVthat just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],
p9
aVthat it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.
p10
aa(lp11
VGreat idea, but it doesn't work at all.
p12
aVSo, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
p13
aVAnd I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,
p14
aVbut everybody, each of us, everybody in the world
p15
aVhas the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,
p16
aVand that's one of the main parts of my work.
p17
aVSo, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,
p18
aVwe've been engaged in a field called active music.
p19
aVWhat are all the possible ways that we can think of
p20
aVto get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,
p21
aVnot just listening, but making music?
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers \u2014
p24
aVwe call these hyperinstruments \u2014 for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,
p25
aVorchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors
p26
aVbuilt right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.
p27
aVAnd just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,
p28
aVI can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,
p29
aVor into something that nobody has ever heard before.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make
p32
aVwonderful instruments like that for everybody,
p33
aVpeople who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?
p34
aVSo, we've made a whole series of instruments.
p35
aVOne of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
p36
aVIt's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,
p37
aVall designed for anybody to play using natural skill.
p38
aVSo, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,
p39
aVuse your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,
p40
aVtouch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.
p41
aVAnd when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,
p42
aVto try these instruments and then collaborate with us
p43
aVto help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
p44
aVWe toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,
p45
aVwhere we built a museum around it.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd that led to something which you probably do know.
p48
aVGuitar Hero came out of our lab,
p49
aVand my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab
p50
aVare proof that if you make the right kind of interface,
p51
aVpeople are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,
p52
aVand playing it over and over and over again.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,
p55
aVbecause my second idea is that it's not enough just to want
p56
aVto make music in something like Guitar Hero.
p57
aVAnd music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
p58
aVIt's very, very important.
p59
aVMusic can change your life, more than almost anything.
p60
aVIt can change the way you communicate with others,
p61
aVit can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying
p62
aVto go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
p63
aVWe are very involved in education. We have a long-term project
p64
aVcalled Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,
p65
aVbut for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,
p66
aVwant to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,
p67
aVhow to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,
p68
aVlike these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,
p69
aVBeatbugs that let you tap in rhythms \u2014 they gather your rhythm,
p70
aVand like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,
p71
aVwho then have to imitate or respond to what your doing \u2014
p72
aVand a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color
p73
aVto make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,
p74
aVyou can go quite deep \u2014 music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,
p75
aVit turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
p76
aa(lp77
VWe've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids
p78
aVaround the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
p79
aVSo, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities
p80
aVin a much broader context, for all kinds of people
p81
aVwho don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
p82
aVSo, one of the growing fields that we're working on
p83
aVat the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
p84
aVA lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called
p85
aV"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
p86
aVIf you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,
p87
aVand he details his whole career of looking at and observing
p88
aVincredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing
p91
aVthat people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
p92
aVMaybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,
p93
aVyou can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,
p94
aVor can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music
p95
aVthat that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that
p96
aVyou can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
p97
aVMusic is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,
p98
aVmovement to people with Parkinson's disease.
p99
aVIt's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo, we're working on understanding those underlying principles
p102
aVand then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.
p103
aVAnd we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.
p104
aVOne of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.
p105
aVIt's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago
p106
aVwe started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.
p107
aVThis has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,
p108
aVso everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.
p109
aVIt's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most
p110
aVand it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
p111
aVI wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
p112
aVVideo: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
p113
aVIt's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,
p114
aVbut to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
p115
aVTo get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,
p116
aVto experiment with it, to make their own music.
p117
aVSo Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
p118
aVEverybody can experience music in a profound way,
p119
aVwe just have to make different tools.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,
p122
aVI think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have
p123
aVof showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although
p124
aVstrangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
p125
aVIf I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,
p126
aVI'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,
p127
aVmore personal things, perhaps deeper things.
p128
aa(lp129
VI think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples
p130
aVof how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,
p131
aVfrom ourselves to the outside world.
p132
aVThe first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called
p133
aVDeath and the Powers. And it's a big opera,
p134
aVone of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
p135
aVAnd it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.
p136
aVSo, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,
p137
aVactually into a series of books.
p138
aVSo this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
p139
aVThe main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera
p140
aVand the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others,
p143
aVto the people we love, and what we can't.
p144
aVEvery object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,
p145
aVlike this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,
p146
aVbut it's actually a robotic music instrument.
p147
aVSo, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,
p148
aVeach string is controlled with a little robotic element \u2014
p149
aVeither little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,
p150
aVacoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.
p151
aVThese robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,
p152
aVand his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
p153
aVThey observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now
p154
aVat MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.
p155
aVThey follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,
p156
aVnot to bump into each other. They go off on their own.
p157
aVAnd then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.
p158
aVEven though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.
p161
aVEvery single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,
p162
aVand when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,
p163
aVwhich have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,
p164
aVbut the whole physical environment becomes this person.
p165
aVThis is how he's chosen to represent himself.
p166
aVThe books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.
p167
aVAnd here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
p168
aVThis is a sneak preview.
p169
aVThis premieres in Monaco \u2014 it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,
p170
aVanother idea with this project \u2014 here's this guy building his legacy
p171
aVthrough this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.
p172
aVBut we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,
p173
aVas a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives
p174
aVto make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.
p175
aVSo instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're
p176
aVthinking of as personal opera.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?
p179
aVEverything I've shown you so far \u2014 whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma
p180
aVor squeezy toy for a child \u2014 the instruments stayed the same and are valuable
p181
aVfor a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.
p182
aVBut what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted
p183
aVto the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,
p184
aVto what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?
p185
aVI think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,
p188
aVso that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
p189
aVSo, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from
p190
aVthe MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,
p191
aVthanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today
p192
aVall the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
p193
aVThis is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,
p194
aVbecause he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.
p195
aVSo, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
p196
aa(lp197
VDan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.
p198
aVI have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct
p199
aVmy own music with this new software.
p200
aa(lp201
VTod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,
p204
aVwhen we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,
p205
aVdid fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out
p206
aVhe was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.
p207
aVHe's very shy, too.
p208
aVSo, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been
p209
aVa constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
p210
aVHe makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area \u2014
p211
aVmentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.
p212
aVAnd I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music
p213
aVtechnology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.
p214
aVWhat Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan
p215
aVbe able easily to make his own pieces,
p216
aVbut how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
p217
aVSo, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
p218
aa(lp219
VAdam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion
p220
aVfollowing the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive
p221
aVperson, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,
p222
aVit's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform
p223
aVone of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,
p226
aVwith precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,
p227
aVto be able to perform his piece of music.
p228
aVSo, the process and the technology \u2014
p229
aVbasically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,
p230
aVwe have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
p231
aVWe went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to
p232
aVwith his speaking controller.
p233
aVAnd this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,
p234
aVthe design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;
p235
aVin the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,
p238
aVwhere, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital
p239
aVextensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?
p240
aVWhat's useful to him as an expressive motion?
p241
aVYou know, what's his metaphor for performance?
p242
aVWhat types of things does he find
p243
aVimportant to control and convey in a piece of music?
p244
aVSo all the parameter fitting, and really the technology
p245
aVwas stretched at that point to fit just Dan.
p246
aVAnd, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies \u2014
p247
aVthey provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.
p248
aVBut what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers
p249
aVthat piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?
p250
aVDo they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship
p251
aVto expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,
p252
aVwith Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process
p253
aVto sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.
p254
aVAnd so that's what we'll do today.
p255
aa(lp256
VTM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone
p257
aVabout what you're going to play now?
p258
aa(lp259
VDE: This is "My Eagle Song."
p260
aVTM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".
p261
aVIn fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,
p262
aVcompletely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
p263
aVSo he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.
p264
aVHe's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VTM: He's really modest, too.
p269
aVSo he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.
p270
aVHe can place those exactly where he wants.
p271
aVEach one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,
p272
aVdraws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,
p273
aVyou can see it also, you can see where the sections are,
p274
aVsomething might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end
p275
aVup with a big bang at the end.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,
p278
aVwe then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.
p279
aVIt's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,
p280
aVit's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.
p281
aVAnd you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.
p282
aVWe asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
p283
aVBut instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly
p284
aVthe camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic
p285
aVmovement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.
p286
aa(lp287
VI think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what
p288
aVDan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,
p289
aVthat when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,
p290
aVvery disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
p291
aVSo, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is
p292
aVthe music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
p293
aVSo, are we ready Adam?
p294
aa(lp295
VAB: Yeah.
p296
aa(lp297
VTM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VTM: Bravo.
