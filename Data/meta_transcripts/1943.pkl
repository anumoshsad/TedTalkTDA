VSo my moment of truth
p4
aVdid not come all at once.
p5
aVIn 2010, I had the chance to be considered
p6
aVfor promotion from my job
p7
aVas director of policy planning
p8
aVat the U.S. State Department.
p9
aVThis was my moment to lean in,
p10
aVto push myself forward
p11
aVfor what are really only a handful
p12
aVof the very top foreign policy jobs,
p13
aVand I had just finished a big, 18-month project
p14
aVfor Secretary Clinton, successfully,
p15
aVand I knew I could handle a bigger job.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe woman I thought I was
p18
aVwould have said yes.
p19
aVBut I had been commuting for two years
p20
aVbetween Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,
p21
aVwhere my husband and my two teenage sons lived,
p22
aVand it was not going well.
p23
aVI tried on the idea of eking out another two years
p24
aVin Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons
p25
aVfrom their school and my husband from his work
p26
aVand asking them to join me.
p27
aVBut deep down, I knew
p28
aVthat the right decision was to go home,
p29
aVeven if I didn't fully recognize the woman
p30
aVwho was making that choice.
p31
aa(lp32
VThat was a decision based on love
p33
aVand responsibility.
p34
aVI couldn't keep watching my oldest son
p35
aVmake bad choices
p36
aVwithout being able to be there for him
p37
aVwhen and if he needed me.
p38
aVBut the real change came more gradually.
p39
aVOver the next year,
p40
aVwhile my family was righting itself,
p41
aVI started to realize
p42
aVthat even if I could go back into government,
p43
aVI didn't want to.
p44
aVI didn't want to miss the last five years
p45
aVthat my sons were at home.
p46
aVI finally allowed myself to accept
p47
aVwhat was really most important to me,
p48
aVnot what I was conditioned to want
p49
aVor maybe what I conditioned myself to want,
p50
aVand that decision led to a reassessment
p51
aVof the feminist narrative that I grew up with
p52
aVand have always championed.
p53
aa(lp54
VI am still completely committed
p55
aVto the cause of male-female equality,
p56
aVbut let's think about what that equality really means,
p57
aVand how best to achieve it.
p58
aVI always accepted the idea
p59
aVthat the most respected and powerful people
p60
aVin our society are men at the top of their careers,
p61
aVso that the measure of male-female equality
p62
aVought to be how many women are in those positions:
p63
aVprime ministers, presidents, CEOs,
p64
aVdirectors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.
p65
aVI still think we should do everything we possibly can
p66
aVto achieve that goal.
p67
aVBut that's only half of real equality,
p68
aVand I now think we're never going to get there
p69
aVunless we recognize the other half.
p70
aVI suggest that real equality,
p71
aVfull equality,
p72
aVdoes not just mean valuing women
p73
aVon male terms.
p74
aVIt means creating a much wider range
p75
aVof equally respected choices
p76
aVfor women and for men.
p77
aVAnd to get there, we have to change our workplaces,
p78
aVour policies and our culture.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn the workplace,
p81
aVreal equality means valuing family
p82
aVjust as much as work,
p83
aVand understanding that the two reinforce each other.
p84
aVAs a leader and as a manager,
p85
aVI have always acted on the mantra,
p86
aVif family comes first,
p87
aVwork does not come second \u2014
p88
aVlife comes together.
p89
aVIf you work for me, and you have a family issue,
p90
aVI expect you to attend to it,
p91
aVand I am confident,
p92
aVand my confidence has always been borne out,
p93
aVthat the work will get done, and done better.
p94
aVWorkers who have a reason to get home
p95
aVto care for their children or their family members
p96
aVare more focused, more efficient,
p97
aVmore results-focused.
p98
aVAnd breadwinners who are also caregivers
p99
aVhave a much wider range
p100
aVof experiences and contacts.
p101
aVThink about a lawyer who spends part of his time
p102
aVat school events for his kids
p103
aVtalking to other parents.
p104
aVHe's much more likely to bring in
p105
aVnew clients for his firm
p106
aVthan a lawyer who never leaves his office.
p107
aVAnd caregiving itself
p108
aVdevelops patience \u2014
p109
aVa lot of patience \u2014
p110
aVand empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.
p111
aVThose are all attributes that are ever more important
p112
aVin a high-speed, horizontal,
p113
aVnetworked global economy.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe best companies actually know this.
p116
aVThe companies that win awards
p117
aVfor workplace flexibility in the United States
p118
aVinclude some of our most successful corporations,
p119
aVand a 2008 national study
p120
aVon the changing workforce
p121
aVshowed that employees
p122
aVin flexible and effective workplaces
p123
aVare more engaged with their work,
p124
aVthey're more satisfied and more loyal,
p125
aVthey have lower levels of stress
p126
aVand higher levels of mental health.
p127
aVAnd a 2012 study of employers
p128
aVshowed that deep, flexible practices
p129
aVactually lowered operating costs
p130
aVand increased adaptability
p131
aVin a global service economy.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo you may think
p134
aVthat the privileging of work over family
p135
aVis only an American problem.
p136
aVSadly, though, the obsession with work
p137
aVis no longer a uniquely American disease.
p138
aVTwenty years ago,
p139
aVwhen my family first started going to Italy,
p140
aVwe used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.
p141
aVSiesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.
p142
aVIt's actually just as much
p143
aVabout embracing the warmth of a family lunch.
p144
aVNow, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses
p145
aVclose for siesta,
p146
aVreflecting the advance of global corporations
p147
aVand 24-hour competition.
p148
aVSo making a place for those we love
p149
aVis actually a global imperative.
p150
aa(lp151
VIn policy terms,
p152
aVreal equality means recognizing
p153
aVthat the work that women have traditionally done
p154
aVis just as important
p155
aVas the work that men have traditionally done,
p156
aVno matter who does it.
p157
aVThink about it: Breadwinning and caregiving
p158
aVare equally necessary for human survival.
p159
aVAt least if we get beyond a barter economy,
p160
aVsomebody has to earn an income
p161
aVand someone else has to convert that income
p162
aVto care and sustenance for loved ones.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow most of you, when you hear me
p165
aVtalk about breadwinning and caregiving,
p166
aVinstinctively translate those categories
p167
aVinto men's work and women's work.
p168
aVAnd we don't typically challenge
p169
aVwhy men's work is advantaged.
p170
aVBut consider a same-sex couple
p171
aVlike my friends Sarah and Emily.
p172
aVThey're psychiatrists.
p173
aVThey got married five years ago,
p174
aVand now they have two-year-old twins.
p175
aVThey love being mothers,
p176
aVbut they also love their work,
p177
aVand they're really good at what they do.
p178
aVSo how are they going to divide up
p179
aVbreadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?
p180
aVShould one of them stop working
p181
aVor reduce hours to be home?
p182
aVOr should they both change their practices
p183
aVso they can have much more flexible schedules?
p184
aVAnd what criteria should they use
p185
aVto make that decision?
p186
aVIs it who makes the most money
p187
aVor who is most committed to her career?
p188
aVOr who has the most flexible boss?
p189
aa(lp190
VThe same-sex perspective helps us see
p191
aVthat juggling work and family
p192
aVare not women's problems,
p193
aVthey're family problems.
p194
aVAnd Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,
p195
aVbecause they have a choice
p196
aVabout how much they want to work.
p197
aVMillions of men and women
p198
aVhave to be both breadwinners and caregivers
p199
aVjust to earn the income they need,
p200
aVand many of those workers are scrambling.
p201
aVThey're patching together care arrangements
p202
aVthat are inadequate
p203
aVand often actually unsafe.
p204
aVIf breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,
p205
aVthen why shouldn't a government
p206
aVinvest as much in an infrastructure of care
p207
aVas the foundation of a healthy society
p208
aVas it invests in physical infrastructure
p209
aVas the backbone of a successful economy?
p210
aa(lp211
VThe governments that get it \u2014
p212
aVno surprises here \u2014
p213
aVthe governments that get it,
p214
aVNorway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,
p215
aVprovide universal child care,
p216
aVsupport for caregivers at home,
p217
aVschool and early childhood education,
p218
aVprotections for pregnant women,
p219
aVand care for the elderly and the disabled.
p220
aVThose governments invest in that infrastructure
p221
aVthe same way they invest in roads and bridges
p222
aVand tunnels and trains.
p223
aVThose societies also show you
p224
aVthat breadwinning and caregiving
p225
aVreinforce each other.
p226
aVThey routinely rank among the top 15 countries
p227
aVof the most globally competitive economies,
p228
aVbut at the same time,
p229
aVthey rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.
p230
aVIn fact, they rank higher than other governments,
p231
aVlike my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,
p232
aVthat have higher average levels of income
p233
aVbut lower rankings on work-life balance.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo changing our workplaces
p236
aVand building infrastructures of care
p237
aVwould make a big difference,
p238
aVbut we're not going to get equally valued choices
p239
aVunless we change our culture,
p240
aVand the kind of cultural change required
p241
aVmeans re-socializing men.
p242
aV(Applause)
p243
aVIncreasingly in developed countries,
p244
aVwomen are socialized to believe that our place
p245
aVis no longer only in the home,
p246
aVbut men are actually still where they always were.
p247
aVMen are still socialized to believe
p248
aVthat they have to be breadwinners,
p249
aVthat to derive their self-worth
p250
aVfrom how high they can climb over other men
p251
aVon a career ladder.
p252
aVThe feminist revolution still has a long way to go.
p253
aVIt's certainly not complete.
p254
aVBut 60 years after
p255
aV"The Feminine Mystique" was published,
p256
aVmany women actually have
p257
aVmore choices than men do.
p258
aVWe can decide to be a breadwinner,
p259
aVa caregiver, or any combination of the two.
p260
aVWhen a man, on the other hand,
p261
aVdecides to be a caregiver,
p262
aVhe puts his manhood on the line.
p263
aVHis friends may praise his decision,
p264
aVbut underneath, they're scratching their heads.
p265
aVIsn't the measure of a man
p266
aVhis willingness to compete with other men
p267
aVfor power and prestige?
p268
aVAnd as many women hold that view as men do.
p269
aVWe know that lots of women
p270
aVstill judge the attractiveness of a man
p271
aVbased in large part on how successful he is
p272
aVin his career.
p273
aVA woman can drop out of the work force
p274
aVand still be an attractive partner.
p275
aVFor a man, that's a risky proposition.
p276
aVSo as parents and partners,
p277
aVwe should be socializing our sons
p278
aVand our husbands
p279
aVto be whatever they want to be,
p280
aVeither caregivers or breadwinners.
p281
aVWe should be socializing them to make caregiving
p282
aVcool for guys.
p283
aV(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VI can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way."
p286
aVBut in fact, the change is  actually already happening.
p287
aVAt least in the United States,
p288
aVlots of men take pride in cooking,
p289
aVand frankly obsess over stoves.
p290
aVThey are in the birthing rooms.
p291
aVThey take paternity leave when they can.
p292
aVThey can walk a baby or soothe a toddler
p293
aVjust as well as their wives can,
p294
aVand they are increasingly
p295
aVdoing much more of the housework.
p296
aVIndeed, there are male college students now
p297
aVwho are starting to say,
p298
aV"I want to be a stay-at-home dad."
p299
aVThat was completely unthinkable
p300
aV50 or even 30 years ago.
p301
aVAnd in Norway, where men have
p302
aVan automatic three month's paternity leave,
p303
aVbut they lose it if they decide not to take it,
p304
aVa high government official told me
p305
aVthat companies are starting to look
p306
aVat prospective male employees
p307
aVand raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact
p308
aVtake their leave when they had kids.
p309
aVThat means that it's starting to seem
p310
aVlike a character defect
p311
aVnot to want to be a fully engaged father.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo I was raised
p314
aVto believe that championing women's rights
p315
aVmeant doing everything we could
p316
aVto get women to the top.
p317
aVAnd I still hope that I live long enough
p318
aVto see men and women equally represented
p319
aVat all levels of the work force.
p320
aVBut I've come to believe that we have to value family
p321
aVevery bit as much as we value work,
p322
aVand that we should entertain the idea
p323
aVthat doing right by those we love
p324
aVwill make all of us better at everything we do.
p325
aa(lp326
VThirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,
p327
aVa wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls
p328
aVand identified an ethic of care,
p329
aVan element of human nature every bit as important
p330
aVas the ethic of justice.
p331
aVIt turns out that "you don't care"
p332
aVis just as much a part of who we are
p333
aVas "that's not fair."
p334
aVBill Gates agrees.
p335
aVHe argues that the two great forces of human nature
p336
aVare self-interest and caring for others.
p337
aVLet's bring them both together.
p338
aVLet's make the feminist revolution
p339
aVa humanist revolution.
p340
aVAs whole human beings,
p341
aVwe will be better caregivers and breadwinners.
p342
aVYou may think that can't happen,
p343
aVbut I grew up in a society
p344
aVwhere my mother put out small vases
p345
aVof cigarettes for dinner parties,
p346
aVwhere blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,
p347
aVand where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.
p348
aVToday, not so much.
p349
aVThe revolution for human equality
p350
aVcan happen.
p351
aVIt is happening.
p352
aVIt will happen.
p353
aVHow far and how fast is up to us.
