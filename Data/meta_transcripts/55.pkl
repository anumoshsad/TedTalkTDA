VI can't help but this wish:
p4
aVto think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you,
p5
aV"If a genie could give you one wish in the world,
p6
aVwhat would it be?"
p7
aVAnd I always answered,
p8
aV"Well, I'd want the wish
p9
aVto have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for."
p10
aVWell, then you'd be screwed,
p11
aVbecause you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish,
p12
aVand now, since we only have one wish \u2014 unlike last year they had three wishes \u2014
p13
aVI'm not going to wish for that.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo let's get to what I would like, which is world peace.
p16
aVAnd I know what you're thinking:
p17
aVYou're thinking, "The poor girl up there,
p18
aVshe thinks she's at a beauty pageant.
p19
aVShe's not. She's at the TED Prize."
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBut I really do think it makes sense.
p22
aVAnd I think that the first step to world peace
p23
aVis for people to meet each other.
p24
aVI've met a lot of different people over the years,
p25
aVand I've filmed some of them,
p26
aVfrom a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world,
p27
aVto a military press officer in Qatar,
p28
aVwho would rather not take over the world.
p29
aVIf you've seen the film "Control Room" that was sent out,
p30
aVyou'd understand a little bit why.
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aVThank you.
p33
aVWow! Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo basically what I'd like to talk about today
p36
aVis a way for people to travel,
p37
aVto meet people in a different way than \u2014
p38
aVbecause you can't travel all over the world at the same time.
p39
aVAnd a long time ago \u2014 well, about 40 years ago \u2014
p40
aVmy mom had an exchange student.
p41
aVAnd I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student.
p42
aVThis is Donna.
p43
aVThis is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.
p44
aVThis is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike.
p45
aVThis is Donna eating ice cream.
p46
aVAnd this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance.
p47
aVI really think as the world is getting smaller,
p48
aVit becomes more and more important
p49
aVthat we learn each other's dance moves,
p50
aVthat we meet each other, we get to know each other,
p51
aVwe are able to figure out a way to cross borders,
p52
aVto understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams,
p53
aVwhat makes them laugh and cry.
p54
aVAnd I know that we can't all do exchange programs,
p55
aVand I can't force everybody to travel;
p56
aVI've already talked about that to Chris and Amy,
p57
aVand they said that there's a problem with this:
p58
aVYou can't force people, free will.
p59
aVAnd I totally support that, so we're not forcing people to travel.
p60
aVBut I'd like to talk about another way to travel
p61
aVthat doesn't require a ship or an airplane,
p62
aVand just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.
p63
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.
p64
aa(lp65
VI was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from,
p66
aVand Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one,
p67
aVbut I think that building bridges is important to me
p68
aVbecause of where I come from.
p69
aVI'm the daughter of an American mother
p70
aVand an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.
p71
aVSo I'm the living product of two cultures coming together.
p72
aVNo pun intended.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVAnd I've also been called,
p75
aVas an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name,
p76
aVthe "Middle East Peace Crisis."
p77
aa(lp78
VSo maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way
p79
aVto bring both sides of my family together \u2014
p80
aVa way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually.
p81
aVIt all kind of started that way,
p82
aVbut I think that I really realized the power of the image
p83
aVwhen I first went to the garbage-collecting village
p84
aVin Egypt, when I was about 16.
p85
aVMy mother took me there.
p86
aVShe's somebody who believes strongly in community service,
p87
aVand decided that this was something that I needed to do.
p88
aVAnd so I went there and I met some amazing women there.
p89
aVThere was a center there,
p90
aVwhere they were teaching people how to read and write,
p91
aVand get vaccinations against the many diseases
p92
aVyou can get from sorting through garbage.
p93
aVAnd I began teaching there.
p94
aVI taught English, and I met some incredible women there.
p95
aVI met people that live seven people to a room,
p96
aVbarely can afford their evening meal,
p97
aVyet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor
p98
aVand just incredible qualities.
p99
aa(lp100
VI got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there.
p101
aVI took pictures of weddings and older family members \u2014
p102
aVthings that they wanted memories of.
p103
aVAbout two years after I started taking these pictures,
p104
aVthe UN Conference on Population and Development
p105
aVasked me to show them at the conference.
p106
aVSo I was 18; I was very excited.
p107
aVIt was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there,
p108
aVand after about two days, they all came down except for three.
p109
aVPeople were very upset,
p110
aVvery angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo,
p111
aVand why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame?
p112
aVAnd as I sat there, I got very depressed.
p113
aVI looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs
p114
aVthat were, you know, very pretty photographs
p115
aVand I was like, "I failed at this."
p116
aVBut I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling
p117
aVthat had come out of people just seeing these photographs.
p118
aVHere I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to,
p119
aVand all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall,
p120
aVand there were arguments, and they had to be taken down.
p121
aVAnd I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible.
p122
aVAnd I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people
p123
aVthat would never have gone to the garbage village themselves,
p124
aVthat would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive
p125
aVin such difficult circumstances.
p126
aVAnd I think it was at that point
p127
aVthat I decided I wanted to use photography and film
p128
aVto somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures,
p129
aVbring people together, cross borders.
p130
aVAnd so that's what really kind of started me off.
p131
aa(lp132
VDid a stint at MTV, made a film called "Startup.com,"
p133
aVand I've done a couple of music films.
p134
aVBut in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start,
p135
aVit was a very surreal feeling for me,
p136
aVbecause before the war started,
p137
aVthere was kind of this media war that was going on.
p138
aVAnd I was watching television in New York,
p139
aVand there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across,
p140
aVand the coverage went from the US State Department
p141
aVto embedded troops.
p142
aVAnd what was coming across on the news
p143
aVwas that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings,
p144
aVand the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators,
p145
aVand throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
p146
aVAnd I knew that there was a completely other story
p147
aVthat was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were.
p148
aVI knew that there was a completely other story being told,
p149
aVand I was thinking, "How are people supposed to communicate with each other
p150
aVwhen they're getting completely different messages,
p151
aVand nobody knows what the other's being told?
p152
aVHow are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
p153
aVor know how to move together into the future?
p154
aVSo I knew that I had to go there.
p155
aVI just wanted to be in the center.
p156
aVI had no plan. I had no funding.
p157
aVI didn't even have a camera at the time \u2014 I had somebody bring it there,
p158
aVbecause I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera,
p159
aVGeorge Bush's favorite channel,
p160
aVand a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked
p161
aVby many governments across the Arab world,
p162
aVand also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden
p163
aVby some people in the US government.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people
p166
aVhas to be doing something right.
p167
aVI've got to go see what this is all about.
p168
aVAnd I also wanted to go see Central Command,
p169
aVwhich was 10 minutes away.
p170
aVAnd that way, I could get access to how this news was being created \u2014
p171
aVon the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,
p172
aVand on the US and Western side, reaching the US.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd when I went there and sat there,
p175
aVand met these people that were in the center of it,
p176
aVand sat with these characters,
p177
aVI met some surprising, very complex people.
p178
aVAnd I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience
p179
aVof when you sit with somebody
p180
aVand you film them, and you listen to them,
p181
aVand you allow them more than a five-second sound bite.
p182
aVThe amazing complexity of people emerges.
p183
aa(lp184
VSamir Khader: Business as usual.
p185
aVIraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
p186
aVBut between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it.
p187
aVTo change the Arab nightmare into the American dream.
p188
aVI still have that dream.
p189
aVMaybe I will never be able to do it,
p190
aVbut I have plans for my children.
p191
aVWhen they finish high school,
p192
aVI will send them to America to study there.
p193
aVI will pay for their study.
p194
aVAnd they will stay there.
p195
aVJosh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers \u2014
p196
aVAl Jazeera showed them \u2014
p197
aVit was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images.
p198
aVMost of the news in America won't show really gory images
p199
aVand this showed American soldiers in uniform, strewn about a floor,
p200
aVa cold tile floor.
p201
aVAnd it was revolting.
p202
aVIt was absolutely revolting.
p203
aVIt made me sick at my stomach.
p204
aVAnd then what hit me was, the night before,
p205
aVthere had been some kind of bombing in Basra,
p206
aVand Al Jazeera had shown images of the people.
p207
aVAnd they were equally, if not more, horrifying \u2014 the images were.
p208
aVAnd I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office,
p209
aVand thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.
p210
aVThat's bad."
p211
aVAnd then going away, and probably eating dinner or something.
p212
aVAnd it didn't affect me as much.
p213
aVSo, the impact that had on me \u2014
p214
aVme realizing that I just saw people on the other side,
p215
aVand those people in the Al Jazeera office
p216
aVmust have felt the way I was feeling that night,
p217
aVand it upset me on a profound level
p218
aVthat I wasn't as bothered as much the night before.
p219
aVIt makes me hate war.
p220
aVBut it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world
p221
aVthat can live without war yet.
p222
aa(lp223
VJehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film.
p224
aVWe didn't know whether it would be able to get out there.
p225
aVWe had no funding for it.
p226
aVWe were incredibly lucky that it got picked up.
p227
aVAnd when we showed the film
p228
aVin both the United States and the Arab world,
p229
aVwe had such incredible reactions.
p230
aVIt was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.
p231
aVIn the Arab world \u2014
p232
aVand it's not really by the film, it's by the characters \u2014
p233
aVI mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person
p234
aVwho was thinking about things.
p235
aVAnd when I showed the film in the Middle East,
p236
aVpeople wanted to meet Josh.
p237
aVHe kind of redefined us as an American population.
p238
aVPeople started to ask me, "Where is this guy now?"
p239
aVAl Jazeera offered him a job.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVAnd Samir, on the other hand,
p242
aVwas also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see,
p243
aVbecause it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship
p244
aVthat the Arab world has with the West.
p245
aa(lp246
VIn the United States, I was blown away by the motivations,
p247
aVthe positive motivations of the American people
p248
aVwhen they'd see this film.
p249
aVYou know, we're criticized abroad
p250
aVfor believing we're the saviors of the world in some way,
p251
aVbut the flip side of it is that, actually,
p252
aVwhen people do see what is happening abroad
p253
aVand people's reactions to some of our policy abroad,
p254
aVwe feel this power, that we need to \u2014
p255
aVwe feel like we have to get the power to change things.
p256
aVAnd I saw this with audiences.
p257
aVThis woman came up to me after the screening and said,
p258
aV"You know, I know this is crazy.
p259
aVI saw the bombs being loaded on the planes,
p260
aVI saw the military going out to war,
p261
aVbut you don't understand people's anger towards us
p262
aVuntil you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war,
p263
aVand how do we get out of this bubble?
p264
aa(lp265
VHow do we understand what the other person is thinking?"
p266
aVNow, I don't know whether a film can change the world.
p267
aVBut I know the power of it,
p268
aVI know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, I'm not a philosopher,
p271
aVso I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this,
p272
aVbut let film speak for itself and take you to this other world.
p273
aVBecause I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders,
p274
aVI'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes
p275
aVbeing taken into another world.
p276
aVAnd these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts
p277
aVthat we're faced with today.
p278
aV[The last 48 hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.]

aV[Paradise Now]

p282

V[Woman: That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!]
p284
aV[If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.]
p285
aa(lp286
V[Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.]
p287
aa(lp288
V[Woman: The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.]
p289
aa(lp290
V[Man: Then let us be equal in death.]
p291
aV[We still have Paradise.]
p292
aa(lp293
V[Woman: There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!]
p294
aa(lp295
V[Man: God forbid!]
p296
aV[May God forgive you.]
p297
aV[If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...]
p298
aV[Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!]
p299
aV[In this life, we're dead anyway.]
p300
aa(lp301
V[One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.]
p302
aa(lp303
V[Woman: And what about us? The ones who remain?]
p304
aV[Will we win that way?]
p305
aV[Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?]
p306
aV[And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?]
p307
aa(lp308
V[Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?]
p309
aa(lp310
V[Woman: Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.]
p311
aa(lp312
V[Man: How, if Israel has no morals?]
p313
aa(lp314
V[Woman: Be careful!]

p358
aV[We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children,]

p371
aVBut I tell you, when you finish that song,
p372
aVpeople will be like, "Damn, I know where you niggas are coming from.

p385
aa(lp386
VJehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater,
p387
aVin a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film,
p388
aVand they felt that feeling of transformation.
p389
aVAnd what I'd like to talk about is
p390
aVhow can we use that feeling
p391
aVto actually create a movement through film?
p392
aVI've been listening to the talks in the conference,
p393
aVand Robert Wright said yesterday
p394
aVthat if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity,
p395
aVthen they will have an appreciation for ours.
p396
aVAnd that's what this is about.
p397
aVIt's about connecting people through film,
p398
aVgetting these independent voices out there.
p399
aVNow, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military
p400
aVand taking a job with Al Jazeera.
p401
aV(Laughter)
p402
aVSo his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International
p403
aVbecause he feels like he can actually use media
p404
aVto bridge the gap between East and West.
p405
aVAnd that's an amazing thing.
p406
aVBut I've been trying to think about ways
p407
aVto give power to these independent voices,
p408
aVto give power to the filmmakers,
p409
aVto give power to people who are trying to use film for change.
p410
aVAnd there are incredible organizations
p411
aVthat are out there doing this already.
p412
aVThere's Witness, that you heard from earlier.
p413
aVThere's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis
p414
aVwho are working together for peace, and documenting that process
p415
aVand getting interviews out there and using this film
p416
aVto take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool,
p417
aVto show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack,
p418
aVand she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.
p419
aVThere's Working Films and there's Current TV,
p420
aVwhich is an incredible platform for people around the world
p421
aVto be able to put their \u2014
p422
aV(Applause)
p423
aVYeah, it's amazing.
p424
aVI've watched it and I'm blown away by it
p425
aVand its potential to bring voices from around the world \u2014
p426
aVindependent voices from around the world \u2014
p427
aVand create a truly democratic, global television.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo what can we do to create a platform for these organizations,
p430
aVto create some momentum,
p431
aVto get everybody in the world involved in this movement?
p432
aVI'd like for us to imagine for a second.
p433
aVImagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world.
p434
aVYou have towns and villages and theaters \u2014
p435
aVall from around the world,
p436
aVgetting together, and sitting in the dark,
p437
aVand sharing a communal experience of watching a film,
p438
aVor a couple of films, together.
p439
aVWatching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live,
p440
aVor just a character that defies stereotypes,
p441
aVmakes a joke, sings a song.
p442
aVComedies, documentaries, shorts.
p443
aVThis amazing power can be used to change people
p444
aVand to bond people together; to cross borders,
p445
aVand have people feel like they're having a communal experience.
p446
aVSo if you imagine this day when all around the world,
p447
aVyou have theaters and places where we project films.
p448
aVIf you imagine projecting from Times Square
p449
aVto Tahrir Square in Cairo,
p450
aVthe same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem.
p451
aVYou know, we've been talking to a friend of mine
p452
aVabout using the side of the Great Pyramid
p453
aVand the Great Wall of China.
p454
aVIt's endless what you can imagine,
p455
aVin terms of where you can project films
p456
aVand where you can have this communal experience.
p457
aVAnd I believe that this one day, if we can create it,
p458
aVthis one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices.
p459
aVThere isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices
p460
aVof the world to get out there,
p461
aVand yet I'm hearing throughout this conference
p462
aVthat the biggest challenge in our future
p463
aVis understanding the other,
p464
aVand having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders.
p465
aVAnd if film can do that,
p466
aVand if we can get all of these different locations in the world
p467
aVto watch these films together \u2014
p468
aVthis could be an incredible day.
p469
aa(lp470
VSo we've already made a partnership,
p471
aVset up through somebody from the TED community,
p472
aVJohn Camen, who introduced me to Steven Apkon,
p473
aVfrom the Jacob Burns Film Center.
p474
aVAnd we started calling up everybody.
p475
aVAnd in the last week,
p476
aVthere have been so many people that have responded to us,
p477
aVfrom as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India.
p478
aVThere are people that want to be a part of this global day of film;
p479
aVto be able to provide a platform for independent voices
p480
aVand independent films to get out there.
p481
aVNow, we've thought about a name for this day,
p482
aVand I'd like to share this with you.
p483
aVNow, the most amazing part of this whole process
p484
aVhas been sharing ideas and wishes,
p485
aVand so I invite you to give brainstorms onto
p486
aVhow does this day echo into the future?
p487
aVHow do we use technology to make this day echo into the future,
p488
aVso that we can build community
p489
aVand have these communities working together, through the Internet?
p490
aVThere was a time, many, many years ago,
p491
aVwhen all of the continents were stuck together.
p492
aVAnd we call that landmass Pangea.
p493
aVSo what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day.
p494
aVAnd if you just imagine
p495
aVthat all of these people in these towns would be watching,
p496
aVthen I think that we can actually really make a movement
p497
aVtowards people understanding each other better.
p498
aa(lp499
VI know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls,
p500
aVbut the only way that I know how to do it,
p501
aVthe only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul
p502
aVall across the world, is by showing them a film.
p503
aVAnd I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there
p504
aVthat can really make this happen.
p505
aVAnd that's my wish.
p506
aVI guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish,
p507
aVbut we're way out of time.
p508
aa(lp509
VChris Anderson: That is an incredible wish.
p510
aVPangea Cinema: The day the world comes together.
p511
aa(lp512
VJN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate.
p513
aVBut it would be the day that the world comes together through film,
p514
aVthe power of film.
