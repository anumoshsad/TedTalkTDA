VI'd like to talk to you today
p4
aVabout a whole new way to think about sexual activity
p5
aVand sexuality education, by comparison.
p6
aVIf you talk to someone today in America
p7
aVabout sexual activity,
p8
aVyou'll find pretty soon you're not just talking
p9
aVabout sexual activity.
p10
aVYou're also talking about baseball.
p11
aVBecause baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor
p12
aVthat Americans use to think about
p13
aVand talk about sexual activity,
p14
aVand we know that because there's
p15
aVall this language in English
p16
aVthat seems to be talking about baseball
p17
aVbut that's really talking about sexual activity.
p18
aVSo, for example, you can be a pitcher or a catcher,
p19
aVand that corresponds to whether you
p20
aVperform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.
p21
aVOf course, there are the bases,
p22
aVwhich refer to specific sexual activities
p23
aVthat happen in a very specific order,
p24
aVultimately resulting in scoring a run
p25
aVor hitting a home run,
p26
aVwhich is usually having vaginal intercourse
p27
aVto the point of orgasm,
p28
aVat least for the guy.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVYou can strike out, which means
p31
aVyou don't get to have any sexual activity.
p32
aVAnd if you're a benchwarmer,
p33
aVyou might be a virgin or somebody who for
p34
aVwhatever reason isn't in the game,
p35
aVmaybe because of your age or because of your ability
p36
aVor because of your skillset.
p37
aVA bat's a penis,
p38
aVand a nappy dugout is a vulva, or a vagina.
p39
aVA glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.
p40
aVA switch-hitter is a bisexual person,
p41
aVand we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.
p42
aVAnd then there's this one:
p43
aV"if there's grass on the field, play ball."
p44
aVAnd that usually refers to
p45
aVif a young person, specifically often a young woman,
p46
aVis old enough to have pubic hair,
p47
aVshe's old enough to have sex with.
p48
aVThis baseball model is incredibly problematic.
p49
aVIt's sexist. It's heterosexist.
p50
aVIt's competitive. It's goal-directed.
p51
aVAnd it can't result in healthy sexuality
p52
aVdeveloping in young people or in adults.
p53
aVSo we need a new model.
p54
aVI'm here today to offer you that new model.
p55
aVAnd it's based on
p56
aVpizza.
p57
aVNow pizza is something that is universally understood
p58
aVand that most people associate with a positive experience.
p59
aVSo let's do this.
p60
aVLet's take baseball and pizza and compare it
p61
aVwhen talking about three aspects of sexual activity:
p62
aVthe trigger for sexual activity,
p63
aVwhat happens during sexual activity,
p64
aVand the expected outcome of sexual activity.
p65
aVSo when do you play baseball?
p66
aVYou play baseball when it's baseball season
p67
aVand when there's a game on the schedule.
p68
aVIt's not exactly your choice.
p69
aVSo if it's prom night or a wedding night
p70
aVor at a party or if our parents aren't home,
p71
aVhey, it's just batter up.
p72
aVCan you imagine saying to your coach,
p73
aV"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,
p74
aVI think I'll sit this game out."
p75
aVThat's just not the way it happens.
p76
aVAnd when you get together to play baseball,
p77
aVimmediately you're with two opposing teams,
p78
aVone playing offense, one playing defense,
p79
aVsomebody's trying to move deeper into the field.
p80
aVThat's usually a sign to the boy.
p81
aVSomebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.
p82
aVThat's often given to the girl.
p83
aVIt's competitive.
p84
aVWe're not playing with each other.
p85
aVWe're playing against each other.
p86
aVAnd when you show up to play baseball,
p87
aVnobody needs to talk about what we're going to do
p88
aVor how this baseball game might be good for us.
p89
aVEverybody knows the rules.
p90
aVYou just take your position and play the game.
p91
aVBut when do you have pizza?
p92
aVWell, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.
p93
aVIt starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.
p94
aV"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVAnd because it's an internal desire,
p97
aVwe actually have some sense of control over that.
p98
aVI could decide that I'm hungry
p99
aVbut know that it's not a great time to eat.
p100
aVAnd then when we get together with someone for pizza,
p101
aVwe're not competing with them,
p102
aVwe're looking for an experience
p103
aVthat both of us will share
p104
aVthat's satisfying for both of us,
p105
aVand when you get together for pizza with somebody,
p106
aVwhat's the first thing you do?
p107
aVYou talk about it.
p108
aVYou talk about what you want.
p109
aVYou talk about what you like.
p110
aVYou may even negotiate it.
p111
aV"How do you feel about pepperoni?" (Laughter)
p112
aV"Not so much, I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself."
p113
aV"Well, maybe we can go half and half."
p114
aVAnd even if you've had pizza with somebody
p115
aVfor a very long time,
p116
aVdon't you still say things like,
p117
aV"Should we get the usual?"
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aV"Or maybe something a little more adventurous?"
p120
aVOkay, so when you're playing baseball,
p121
aVso if we talk about during sexual activity,
p122
aVwhen you're playing baseball,
p123
aVyou're just supposed to round the bases
p124
aVin the proper order one at a time.
p125
aVYou can't hit the ball and run to right field.
p126
aVThat doesn't work.
p127
aVAnd you also can't get to second base and say,
p128
aV"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."
p129
aVNo.
p130
aVAnd also, of course, with baseball, there's, like,
p131
aVthe specific equipment and a specific skill set.
p132
aVNot everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
p133
aVOkay, but what about pizza?
p134
aVWhen we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza,
p135
aVisn't it all about what's our pleasure?
p136
aVThere are a million different kinds of pizza.
p137
aVThere's a million different toppings.
p138
aVThere's a million different ways to eat pizza.
p139
aVAnd none of them are wrong. They're different.
p140
aVAnd in this case, difference is good,
p141
aVbecause that's going to increase the chance
p142
aVthat we're having a satisfying experience.
p143
aVAnd lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?
p144
aVWell, in baseball, you play to win.
p145
aVYou score as many runs as you can.
p146
aVThere's always a winner in baseball,
p147
aVand that means there's always a loser in baseball.
p148
aVBut what about pizza?
p149
aVWell, in pizza, we're not really \u2014
p150
aVthere's no winning. How do you win pizza?
p151
aVYou don't. But you do look for,
p152
aV"Are we satisfied?"
p153
aVAnd sometimes that can be different amounts
p154
aVover different times or with different people
p155
aVor on different days.
p156
aVAnd we get to decide when we feel satisfied.
p157
aVIf we're still hungry, we might have some more.
p158
aVIf you eat too much, though,
p159
aVyou just feel gross.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVSo what if we could take this pizza model
p162
aVand overlay it on top of sexuality education?
p163
aVA lot of sexuality education that happens today
p164
aVis so influenced by the baseball model,
p165
aVand it sets up education that can't help
p166
aVbut produce unhealthy sexuality in young people.
p167
aVAnd those young people become older people.
p168
aVBut if we could create sexuality education
p169
aVthat was more like pizza,
p170
aVwe could create education that invites people
p171
aVto think about their own desires,
p172
aVto make deliberate decisions about what they want,
p173
aVto talk about it with their partners,
p174
aVand to ultimately look for
p175
aVnot some external outcome
p176
aVbut for what feels satisfying,
p177
aVand we get to decide that.
p178
aVYou may have noticed
p179
aVin the baseball and pizza comparison,
p180
aVunder the baseball, it's all commands.
p181
aVThey're all exclamation points.
p182
aVBut under the pizza model, they're questions.
p183
aVAnd who gets to answer those questions?
p184
aVYou do. I do.
p185
aVSo remember, when we're thinking about
p186
aVsexuality education and sexual activity,
p187
aVbaseball, you're out.
p188
aVPizza is the way to think about healthy,
p189
aVsatisfying sexual activity,
p190
aVand good, comprehensive sexuality education.
p191
aVThank you very much for your time.
