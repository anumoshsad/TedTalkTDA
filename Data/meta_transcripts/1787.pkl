VHave you ever experienced a moment in your life
p4
aVthat was so painful and confusing,
p5
aVthat all you wanted to do
p6
aVwas learn as much as you could to make sense of it all?
p7
aVWhen I was 13, a close family friend who was like an uncle to me
p8
aVpassed away from pancreatic cancer.
p9
aVWhen the disease hit so close to home,
p10
aVI knew I needed to learn more.
p11
aVSo I went online to find answers.
p12
aVUsing the Internet, I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer,
p13
aVand what I had found shocked me.
p14
aVOver 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late,
p15
aVwhen someone has less than a two percent chance of survival.
p16
aVWhy are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer?
p17
aVThe reason?
p18
aVToday's current "modern" medicine is a 60-year-old technique.
p19
aVThat's older than my dad.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBut also, it's extremely expensive, costing 800 dollars per test,
p22
aVand it's grossly inaccurate, missing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.
p23
aVYour doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer
p24
aVin order to give you this test.
p25
aVLearning this, I knew there had to be a better way.
p26
aVSo, I set up scientific criteria
p27
aVas to what a sensor would have to look like
p28
aVin order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer.
p29
aVThe sensor would have to be:
p30
aVinexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,
p31
aVselective, and minimally invasive.
p32
aVNow, there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades.
p33
aVAnd that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer,
p34
aVwe're looking at your bloodstream,
p35
aVwhich is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein,
p36
aVand you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein.
p37
aVJust this one protein.
p38
aVThat's next to impossible.
p39
aVHowever, undeterred due to my teenage optimism \u2014
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aVI went online to a teenager's two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.
p43
aVI got everything for my homework from those two sources.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVAnd what I had found was an article
p46
aVthat listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins
p47
aVthat are found when you have pancreatic cancer.
p48
aVSo, I decided to go and make it my new mission
p49
aVto go through all these proteins,
p50
aVand see which ones could serve as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.
p51
aVAnd to make it a bit simpler for myself,
p52
aVI decided to map out scientific criteria, and here it is.
p53
aVEssentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers,
p54
aVat high levels in the bloodstream,
p55
aVin the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.
p56
aVAnd so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task,
p57
aVand finally, on the 4,000th try,
p58
aVwhen I'm close to losing my sanity,
p59
aVI find the protein.
p60
aVAnd the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin,
p61
aVand it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein,
p62
aVunless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,
p63
aVin which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.
p64
aVBut also, the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease,
p65
aVwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
p66
aVSo now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect,
p67
aVI then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein,
p68
aVand thus, pancreatic cancer.
p69
aVNow, my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place,
p70
aVpossibly the most unlikely place for innovation \u2014
p71
aVmy high school biology class, the absolute stifler of innovation.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aV(Applause)
p74
aVAnd I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes,
p75
aVand that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon
p76
aVthat's an atom thick, and one 50,000th the diameter of your hair.
p77
aVAnd despite their extremely small sizes,
p78
aVthey have these incredible properties.
p79
aVThey're kind of like the superheroes of material science.
p80
aVAnd while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class,
p81
aVwe were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules,
p82
aVcalled antibodies.
p83
aVAnd these are pretty cool because they only react
p84
aVwith one specific protein,
p85
aVbut they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes.
p86
aVAnd so then, I was sitting in class, and suddenly it hit me:
p87
aVI could combine what I was reading about, carbon nanotubes,
p88
aVwith what I was supposed to be thinking about, antibodies.
p89
aVEssentially, I could weave a bunch of these antibodies
p90
aVinto a network of carbon nanotubes,
p91
aVsuch that you have a network that only reacts with one protein,
p92
aVbut also, due to the properties of these nanotubes,
p93
aVit will change its electrical properties,
p94
aVbased on the amount of protein present.
p95
aVHowever, there's a catch.
p96
aVThese networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy.
p97
aVAnd since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.
p98
aVSo that's why I chose to use paper.
p99
aVMaking a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple
p100
aVas making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.
p101
aV(Laughs)
p102
aVYou start with some water, pour in some nanotubes,
p103
aVadd antibodies, mix it up, take some paper, dip it, dry it,
p104
aVand you can detect cancer.
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVThen, suddenly, a thought occurred
p107
aVthat kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here.
p108
aVI can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop.
p109
aVMy mom wouldn't really like that.
p110
aVSo instead, I decided to go for a lab.
p111
aVSo I typed up a budget, a materials list, a timeline, and a procedure,
p112
aVand I emailed it to 200 different professors
p113
aVat Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health \u2014
p114
aVessentially, anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.
p115
aVI sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in,
p116
aVsaying, "You're a genius! You're going to save us all!"
p117
aVAnd \u2014
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVThen reality took hold, and over the course of a month,
p120
aVI got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails.
p121
aVOne professor even went through my entire procedure,
p122
aVpainstakingly \u2014 I'm not really sure where he got all this time \u2014
p123
aVand he went through and said why each and every step
p124
aVwas like the worst mistake I could ever make.
p125
aVClearly, the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did.
p126
aVHowever, there is a silver lining.
p127
aVOne professor said, "Maybe I might be able to help you, kid."
p128
aVSo, I went in that direction.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVAs you can never say no to a kid.
p131
aVAnd so then, three months later,
p132
aVI finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy,
p133
aVand I get into his lab, I get all excited, and then I sit down,
p134
aVI start opening my mouth and talking,
p135
aVand five seconds later, he calls in another Ph.D.
p136
aVPh.D.s just flock into this little room,
p137
aVand they're just firing these questions at me,
p138
aVand by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car.
p139
aVThere were 20 Ph.D.s, plus me and the professor
p140
aVcrammed into this tiny office space,
p141
aVwith them firing these rapid-fire questions at me,
p142
aVtrying to sink my procedure.
p143
aVHow unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVHowever, subjecting myself to that interrogation \u2014
p146
aVI answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few
p147
aVbut I got them right \u2014
p148
aVand I finally landed the lab space I needed.
p149
aVBut it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure
p150
aVhad something like a million holes in it,
p151
aVand over the course of seven months,
p152
aVI painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes.
p153
aVThe result?
p154
aVOne small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.
p155
aVThis makes it 168 times faster,
p156
aVover 26,000 times less expensive,
p157
aVand over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard
p158
aVfor pancreatic cancer detection.
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aVOne of the best parts of the sensor, though,
p161
aVis that it has close to 100 percent accuracy,
p162
aVand can detect the cancer in the earliest stages,
p163
aVwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
p164
aVAnd so in the next two to five years,
p165
aVthis sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates
p166
aVfrom a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent,
p167
aVand it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer.
p168
aVBut it wouldn't stop there.
p169
aVBy switching out that antibody,
p170
aVyou can look at a different protein, thus, a different disease \u2014
p171
aVpotentially any disease in the entire world.
p172
aVSo that ranges from heart disease, to malaria, HIV, AIDS,
p173
aVas well as other forms of cancer \u2014 anything.
p174
aVAnd so, hopefully one day,
p175
aVwe can all have that one extra uncle,
p176
aVthat one mother, that one brother, sister,
p177
aVwe can have that one more family member to love.
p178
aVAnd that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden
p179
aVthat comes from pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer,
p180
aVand potentially any disease.
p181
aVBut through the Internet, anything is possible.
p182
aVTheories can be shared,
p183
aVand you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees
p184
aVto have your ideas valued.
p185
aVIt's a neutral space, where what you look like, age or gender \u2014
p186
aVit doesn't matter.
p187
aVIt's just your ideas that count.
p188
aVFor me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way,
p189
aVto realize that there's so much more to it
p190
aVthan just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVYou could be changing the world.
p193
aVSo if a 15 year-old who didn't even know what a pancreas was
p194
aVcould find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer \u2014
p195
aVjust imagine what you could do.
p196
aVThank you.
