VSo many of you have probably seen the movie "The Martian."
p4
aVBut for those of you who did not, it's a movie about an astronaut
p5
aVwho is stranded on Mars, and his efforts to stay alive
p6
aVuntil the Earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to Earth.
p7
aVGladly, they do re-establish communication
p8
aVwith the character, astronaut Watney, at some point
p9
aVso that he's not as alone on Mars until he can be rescued.
p10
aVSo while you're watching the movie, or even if you haven't,
p11
aVwhen you think about Mars,
p12
aVyou're probably thinking about how far away it is and how distant.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd, what might not have occurred to you is,
p15
aVwhat are the logistics really like of working on another planet \u2014
p16
aVof living on two planets
p17
aVwhen there are people on the Earth and there are rovers or people on Mars?
p18
aVSo think about when you have friends, families and co-workers
p19
aVin California, on the West Coast or in other parts of the world.
p20
aVWhen you're trying to communicate with them,
p21
aVone of the things you probably first think about is:
p22
aVwait, what time is it in California?
p23
aVWill I wake them up? Is it OK to call?
p24
aVSo even if you're interacting with colleagues who are in Europe,
p25
aVyou're immediately thinking about:
p26
aVWhat does it take to coordinate communication when people are far away?
p27
aVSo we don't have people on Mars right now, but we do have rovers.
p28
aVAnd actually right now, on Curiosity, it is 6:10 in the morning.
p29
aVSo, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.
p30
aVWe have four rovers on Mars.
p31
aVThe United States has put four rovers on Mars since the mid-1990s,
p32
aVand I have been privileged enough to work on three of them.
p33
aVSo, I am a spacecraft engineer, a spacecraft operations engineer,
p34
aVat NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Los Angeles, California.
p35
aVAnd these rovers are our robotic emissaries.
p36
aVSo, they are our eyes and our ears, and they see the planet for us
p37
aVuntil we can send people.
p38
aVSo we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers.
p39
aVSo before we send people, we send robots.
p40
aVSo the reason there's a time difference on Mars right now,
p41
aVfrom the time that we're at
p42
aVis because the Martian day is longer than the Earth day.
p43
aVOur Earth day is 24 hours,
p44
aVbecause that's how long it takes the Earth to rotate,
p45
aVhow long it takes to go around once.
p46
aVSo our day is 24 hours.
p47
aVIt takes Mars 24 hours and approximately 40 minutes to rotate once.
p48
aVSo that means that the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.
p49
aVSo teams of people who are operating the rovers on Mars, like this one,
p50
aVwhat we are doing is we are living on Earth, but working on Mars.
p51
aVSo we have to think as if we are actually on Mars with the rover.
p52
aVOur job, the job of this team, of which I'm a part of,
p53
aVis to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day.
p54
aVTo tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.
p55
aVSo while she's sleeping \u2014 and the rover does sleep at night
p56
aVbecause she needs to recharge her batteries
p57
aVand she needs to weather the cold Martian night.
p58
aVAnd so she sleeps.
p59
aVSo while she sleeps, we work on her program for the next day.
p60
aVSo I work the Martian night shift.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVSo in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars \u2014
p63
aVlike, let's say I need to be at work at 5:00 p.m.,
p64
aVthis team needs to be at work at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,
p65
aVthen we have to come to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,
p66
aVin order to stay in sync with Mars.
p67
aVThat's like moving a time zone every day.
p68
aVSo one day you come in at 8:00, the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,
p69
aVthe next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,
p70
aVthe next day at 10:00.
p71
aVSo you keep moving 40 minutes every day,
p72
aVuntil soon you're coming to work in the middle of the night \u2014
p73
aVthe middle of the Earth night.
p74
aVRight? So you can imagine how confusing that is.
p75
aVHence, the Mars watch.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVThis weights in this watch have been mechanically adjusted
p78
aVso that it runs more slowly.
p79
aVRight? And we didn't start out \u2014
p80
aVI got this watch in 2004
p81
aVwhen Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then.
p82
aVWe didn't start out thinking
p83
aVthat we were going to need Mars watches.
p84
aVRight? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers
p85
aVand on the mission control screens, and that would be enough.
p86
aVYeah, not so much.
p87
aVBecause we weren't just working on Mars time,
p88
aVwe were actually living on Mars time.
p89
aVAnd we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was.
p90
aVSo you really needed something on your wrist to tell you:
p91
aVWhat time is it on the Earth? What time is it on Mars?
p92
aVAnd it wasn't just the time on Mars that was confusing;
p93
aVwe also needed to be able to talk to each other about it.
p94
aVSo a "sol" is a Martian day \u2014 again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.
p95
aVSo when we're talking about something that's happening on the Earth,
p96
aVwe will say, today.
p97
aVSo, for Mars, we say, "tosol."
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVYesterday became "yestersol" for Mars.
p100
aVAgain, we didn't start out thinking, "Oh, let's invent a language."
p101
aVIt was just very confusing.
p102
aVI remember somebody walked up to me and said,
p103
aV"I would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."
p104
aVAnd I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, or Mars, tomorrow?"
p105
aVWe started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVTomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow."
p108
aVBecause people have different preferences for the words they use.
p109
aVSome of you might say "soda" and some of you might say "pop."
p110
aVSo we have people who say "nextersol" or "solorrow."
p111
aVAnd then something that I noticed after a few years of working on these missions,
p112
aVwas that the people who work on the rovers, we say "tosol."
p113
aVThe people who work on the landed missions that don't rove around,
p114
aVthey say "tosoul."
p115
aVSo I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVSo we have the watches and the language, and you're detecting a theme here, right?
p118
aVSo that we don't get confused.
p119
aVBut even the Earth daylight could confuse us.
p120
aVIf you think that right now, you've come to work
p121
aVand it's the middle of the Martian night
p122
aVand there's light streaming in from the windows
p123
aVthat's going to be confusing as well.
p124
aVSo you can see from this image of the control room
p125
aVthat all of the blinds are down.
p126
aVSo that there's no light to distract us.
p127
aVThe blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing,
p128
aVand they didn't go up until we went off Mars time.
p129
aVSo this also works for the house, for at home.
p130
aVI've been on Mars time three times, and my husband is like,
p131
aVOK, we're getting ready for Mars time.
p132
aVAnd so he'll put foil all over the windows and dark curtains and shades
p133
aVbecause it also affects your families.
p134
aVAnd so here I was living in kind of this darkened environment, but so was he.
p135
aVAnd he'd gotten used to it.
p136
aVBut then I would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work.
p137
aVShould I come home? Are you awake?
p138
aVWhat time is it on Mars?
p139
aVAnd I decided, OK, so he needs a Mars watch.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVBut of course, it's 2016, so there's an app for that.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVSo now instead of the watches, we can also use our phones.
p144
aVBut the impact on families was just across the board;
p145
aVit wasn't just those of us who were working on the rovers
p146
aVbut our families as well.
p147
aVThis is David Oh, one of our flight directors,
p148
aVand he's at the beach in Los Angeles with his family at 1:00 in the morning.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVSo because we landed in August
p151
aVand his kids didn't have to go back to school until September,
p152
aVthey actually went on to Mars time with him for one month.
p153
aVThey got up 40 minutes later every day.
p154
aVAnd they were on dad's work schedule.
p155
aVSo they lived on Mars time for a month and had these great adventures,
p156
aVlike going bowling in the middle of the night
p157
aVor going to the beach.
p158
aVAnd one of the things that we all discovered
p159
aVis you can get anywhere in Los Angeles
p160
aVat 3:00 in the morning when there's no traffic.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VSo we would get off work,
p165
aVand we didn't want to go home and bother our families,
p166
aVand we were hungry, so instead of going locally to eat something,
p167
aVwe'd go, "Wait, there's this great all-night deli in Long Beach,
p168
aVand we can get there in 10 minutes!"
p169
aVSo we would drive down \u2014 it was like the 60s, no traffic.
p170
aVWe would drive down there, and the restaurant owners would go,
p171
aV"Who are you people?
p172
aVAnd why are you at my restaurant at 3:00 in the morning?"
p173
aVSo they came to realize that there were these packs of Martians,
p174
aVroaming the LA freeways, in the middle of the night \u2014
p175
aVin the middle of the Earth night.
p176
aVAnd we did actually start calling ourselves Martians.
p177
aVSo those of us who were on Mars time would refer to ourselves as Martians,
p178
aVand everyone else as Earthlings.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd that's because when you're moving a time-zone every day,
p183
aVyou start to really feel separated from everyone else.
p184
aVYou're literally in your own world.
p185
aVSo I have this button on that says, "I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."
p186
aVAnd there's a picture of it up on the screen.
p187
aVSo the reason we got these buttons is because we work on Mars time
p188
aVin order to be as efficient as possible with the rover on Mars,
p189
aVto make the best use of our time.
p190
aVBut we don't stay on Mars time for more than three to four months.
p191
aVEventually, we'll move to a modified Mars time, which is what we're working now.
p192
aVAnd that's because it's hard on your bodies, it's hard on your families.
p193
aVIn fact, there were sleep researchers who actually were studying us
p194
aVbecause it was so unusual for humans to try to extend their day.
p195
aVAnd they had about 30 of us
p196
aVthat they would do sleep deprivation experiments on.
p197
aVSo I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one.
p198
aVAnd that was because, again, this eventually becomes hard on your body.
p199
aVEven though it was a blast.
p200
aVIt was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team,
p201
aVbut it is difficult to sustain.
p202
aVSo these rover missions are our first steps out into the solar system.
p203
aVWe are learning how to live on more than one planet.
p204
aVWe are changing our perspective to become multi-planetary.
p205
aVSo the next time you see a Star Wars movie,
p206
aVand there are people going from the Dagobah system to Tatooine,
p207
aVthink about what it really means to have people spread out so far.
p208
aVWhat it means in terms of the distances between them,
p209
aVhow they will start to feel separate from each other
p210
aVand just the logistics of the time.
p211
aVWe have not sent people to Mars yet, but we hope to.
p212
aVAnd between companies like SpaceX and NASA
p213
aVand all of the international space agencies of the world,
p214
aVwe hope to do that in the next few decades.
p215
aVSo soon we will have people on Mars, and we truly will be multi-planetary.
p216
aVAnd the young boy or the young girl
p217
aVwho will be going to Mars could be in this audience or listening today.
p218
aVI have wanted to work at JPL on these missions since I was 14 years old
p219
aVand I am privileged to be a part of it.
p220
aVAnd this is a remarkable time in the space program,
p221
aVand we are all in this journey together.
p222
aVSo the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day,
p223
aVjust remember, it's all a matter of your Earthly perspective.
p224
aVThank you.
p225
aV(Applause)
