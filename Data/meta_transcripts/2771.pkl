VHow many people here would like to live to be at least 80 years old?
p4
aVYeah.
p5
aVI think we all have this hopeful expectation
p6
aVof living into old age.
p7
aVLet's project out into the future,
p8
aVto your future "you's,"
p9
aVand let's imagine that we're all 85.
p10
aVNow, everyone look at two people.
p11
aVOne of you probably has Alzheimer's disease.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAlright, alright.
p16
aVAnd maybe you're thinking, "Well, it won't be me."
p17
aVThen, OK. You are a caregiver.
p18
aVSo \u2014
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
Vso in some way,
p23
aVthis terrifying disease is likely to affect us all.
p24
aa(lp25
VPart of the fear around Alzheimer's stems from the sense
p26
aVthat there's nothing we can do about it.
p27
aVDespite decades of research, we still have no disease-modifying treatment
p28
aVand no cure.
p29
aVSo if we're lucky enough to live long enough,
p30
aVAlzheimer's appears to be our brain's destiny.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut maybe it doesn't have to be.
p33
aVWhat if I told you we could change these statistics,
p34
aVliterally change our brain's destiny,
p35
aVwithout relying on a cure or advancements in medicine?
p36
aa(lp37
VLet's begin by looking at what we currently understand
p38
aVabout the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.
p39
aVHere's a picture of two neurons connecting.
p40
aVThe point of connection, this space circled in red,
p41
aVis called the synapse.
p42
aVThe synapse is where neurotransmitters are released.
p43
aVThis is where signals are transmitted, where communication happens.
p44
aVThis is where we think, feel, see, hear, desire ...
p45
aVand remember.
p46
aVAnd the synapse is where Alzheimer's happens.
p47
aa(lp48
VLet's zoom in on the synapse
p49
aVand look at a cartoon representation of what's going on.
p50
aVDuring the business of communicating information,
p51
aVin addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse,
p52
aVneurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta.
p53
aVNormally, amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by microglia,
p54
aVthe janitor cells of our brains.
p55
aVWhile the molecular causes of Alzheimer's are still debated,
p56
aVmost neuroscientists believe that the disease begins
p57
aVwhen amyloid beta begins to accumulate.
p58
aVToo much is released, or not enough is cleared away,
p59
aVand the synapse begins to pile up with amyloid beta.
p60
aVAnd when this happens, it binds to itself,
p61
aVforming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques.
p62
aa(lp63
VHow many people here are 40 years old or older?
p64
aVYou're afraid to admit it now.
p65
aVThis initial step into the disease,
p66
aVthis presence of amyloid plaques accumulating,
p67
aVcan already be found in your brains.
p68
aVThe only way we could be sure of this would be through a PET scan,
p69
aVbecause at this point, you are blissfully unaware.
p70
aVYou're not showing any impairments in memory, language, or cognition ...
p71
aVyet.
p72
aVWe think it takes at least 15 to 20 years of amyloid plaque accumulation
p73
aVbefore it reaches a tipping point,
p74
aVthen triggering a molecular cascade
p75
aVthat causes the clinical symptoms of the disease.
p76
aVPrior to the tipping point,
p77
aVyour lapses in memory might include things like,
p78
aV"Why did I come in this room?"
p79
aVor "Oh ... what's his name?"
p80
aVor "Where did I put my keys?"
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, before you all start freaking out again,
p83
aVbecause I know half of you did at least one of those in the last 24 hours \u2014
p84
aVthese are all normal kinds of forgetting.
p85
aVIn fact, I would argue that these examples
p86
aVmight not even involve your memory,
p87
aVbecause you didn't pay attention to where you put your keys
p88
aVin the first place.
p89
aVAfter the tipping point,
p90
aVthe glitches in memory, language and cognition are different.
p91
aVInstead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket
p92
aVor on the table by the door,
p93
aVyou find them in the refrigerator,
p94
aVor you find them and you think,
p95
aV"What are these for?"
p96
aa(lp97
VSo what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point?
p98
aVOur microglia janitor cells become hyper-activated,
p99
aVreleasing chemicals that cause inflammation and cellular damage.
p100
aVWe think they might actually start clearing away
p101
aVthe synapses themselves.
p102
aVA crucial neural transport protein called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated
p103
aVand twists itself into something called "tangles,"
p104
aVwhich choke off the neurons from the inside.
p105
aVBy mid-stage Alzheimer's, we have massive inflammation and tangles
p106
aVand all-out war at the synapse
p107
aVand cell death.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease,
p110
aVat what point would you ideally want to intervene?
p111
aVMany scientists are betting big on the simplest solution:
p112
aVkeep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point,
p113
aVwhich means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound
p114
aVthat will prevent, eliminate, or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation.
p115
aVSo the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be a preventative medicine.
p116
aVWe're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point,
p117
aVbefore the cascade is triggered,
p118
aVbefore we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator.
p119
aVWe think this is why, to date, these kinds of drugs have failed
p120
aVin clinical trials \u2014
p121
aVnot because the science wasn't sound,
p122
aVbut because the people in these trials were already symptomatic.
p123
aVIt was too late.
p124
aVThink of amyloid plaques as a lit match.
p125
aVAt the tipping point, the match sets fire to the forest.
p126
aVOnce the forest is ablaze,
p127
aVit doesn't do any good to blow out the match.
p128
aVYou have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire.
p129
aa(lp130
VEven before scientists sort this out,
p131
aVthis information is actually really good news for us,
p132
aVbecause it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation
p133
aVof amyloid plaques.
p134
aVAnd so there are things we can do
p135
aVto keep us from reaching that tipping point.
p136
aa(lp137
VLet's picture your risk of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.
p138
aVWe're going to pile risk factors on one arm,
p139
aVand when that arm hits the floor, you are symptomatic
p140
aVand diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
p141
aVLet's imagine you're 50 years old.
p142
aVYou're not a spring chicken anymore,
p143
aVso you've accumulated some amyloid plaques with age.
p144
aVYour scale is tipped a little bit.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow let's look at your DNA.
p147
aVWe've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads.
p148
aVSome of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it.
p149
aVIf you're like Alice in "Still Alice,"
p150
aVyou've inherited a rare genetic mutation that cranks out amyloid beta,
p151
aVand this alone will tip your scale arm to the ground.
p152
aVBut for most of us, the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit.
p153
aVFor example, APOE4 is a gene variant that increases amyloid,
p154
aVbut you can inherit a copy of APOE4 from mom and dad
p155
aVand still never get Alzheimer's,
p156
aVwhich means that for most of us,
p157
aVour DNA alone does not determine whether we get Alzheimer's.
p158
aVSo what does?
p159
aVWe can't do anything about getting older or the genes we've inherited.
p160
aVSo far, we haven't changed our brain's destiny.
p161
aa(lp162
VWhat about sleep?
p163
aVIn slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid
p164
aVthroughout our brains,
p165
aVclearing away metabolic waste that accumulated in our synapses
p166
aVwhile we were awake.
p167
aVDeep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain.
p168
aVBut what happens if you shortchange yourself on sleep?
p169
aVMany scientists believe
p170
aVthat poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of Alzheimer's.
p171
aVA single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta.
p172
aVAnd amyloid accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep,
p173
aVwhich in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate.
p174
aVAnd so now we have this positive feedback loop
p175
aVthat's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat else?
p178
aVCardiovascular health.
p179
aVHigh blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,
p180
aVhave all been shown to increase our risk of developing Alzheimer's.
p181
aVSome autopsy studies have shown
p182
aVthat as many as 80 percent of people with Alzheimer's
p183
aValso had cardiovascular disease.
p184
aVAerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta
p185
aVin animal models of the disease.
p186
aVSo a heart-healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet
p187
aVcan help to counter the tipping of this scale.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo there are many things we can do
p190
aVto prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's.
p191
aVBut let's say you haven't done any of them.
p192
aVLet's say you're 65;
p193
aVthere's Alzheimer's in your family, so you've likely inherited a gene or two
p194
aVthat tips your scale arm a bit;
p195
aVyou've been burning the candle at both ends for years;
p196
aVyou love bacon;
p197
aVand you don't run unless someone's chasing you.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VLet's imagine that your amyloid plaques have reached that tipping point.
p202
aVYour scale arm has crashed to the floor.
p203
aVYou've tripped the cascade,
p204
aVsetting fire to the forest,
p205
aVcausing inflammation, tangles, and cell death.
p206
aVYou should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.
p207
aVYou should be having trouble finding words and keys
p208
aVand remembering what I said at the beginning of this talk.
p209
aVBut you might not be.
p210
aa(lp211
VThere's one more thing you can do to protect yourself
p212
aVfrom experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's,
p213
aVeven if you have the full-blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain.
p214
aVIt has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve.
p215
aVRemember, the experience of having Alzheimer's
p216
aVis ultimately a result of losing synapses.
p217
aVThe average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses,
p218
aVwhich is fantastic; we've got a lot to work with.
p219
aVAnd this isn't a static number.
p220
aVWe gain and lose synapses all the time,
p221
aVthrough a process called neural plasticity.
p222
aVEvery time we learn something new,
p223
aVwe are creating and strengthening new neural connections,
p224
aVnew synapses.
p225
aa(lp226
VIn the Nun Study,
p227
aV678 nuns, all over the age of 75 when the study began,
p228
aVwere followed for more than two decades.
p229
aVThey were regularly given physical checkups and cognitive tests,
p230
aVand when they died, their brains were all donated for autopsy.
p231
aVIn some of these brains, scientists discovered something surprising.
p232
aVDespite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage \u2014
p233
aVwhat appeared to be unquestionable Alzheimer's \u2014
p234
aVthe nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs
p235
aVof having the disease while they were alive.
p236
aa(lp237
VHow can this be?
p238
aVWe think it's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve,
p239
aVwhich is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses.
p240
aVPeople who have more years of formal education,
p241
aVwho have a high degree of literacy,
p242
aVwho engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities,
p243
aVall have more cognitive reserve.
p244
aVThey have an abundance and a redundancy in neural connections.
p245
aVSo even if they have a disease like Alzheimer's
p246
aVcompromising some of their synapses,
p247
aVthey've got many extra backup connections,
p248
aVand this buffers them from noticing that anything is amiss.
p249
aa(lp250
VLet's imagine a simplified example.
p251
aVLet's say you only know one thing about a subject.
p252
aVLet's say it's about me.
p253
aVYou know that Lisa Genova wrote "Still Alice,"
p254
aVand that's the only thing you know about me.
p255
aVYou have that single neural connection,
p256
aVthat one synapse.
p257
aVNow imagine you have Alzheimer's.
p258
aVYou have plaques and tangles and inflammation
p259
aVand microglia devouring that synapse.
p260
aVNow when someone asks you, "Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'"
p261
aVyou can't remember,
p262
aVbecause that synapse is either failing or gone.
p263
aVYou've forgotten me forever.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut what if you had learned more about me?
p266
aVLet's say you learned four things about me.
p267
aVNow imagine you have Alzheimer's,
p268
aVand three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed.
p269
aVYou still have a way to detour the wreckage.
p270
aVYou can still remember my name.
p271
aVSo we can be resilient to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology
p272
aVthrough the recruitment of yet-undamaged pathways.
p273
aVAnd we create these pathways, this cognitive reserve,
p274
aVby learning new things.
p275
aVIdeally, we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible,
p276
aVrecruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo this really doesn't mean doing crossword puzzles.
p279
aVYou don't want to simply retrieve information you've already learned,
p280
aVbecause this is like traveling down old, familiar streets,
p281
aVcruising neighborhoods you already know.
p282
aVYou want to pave new neural roads.
p283
aVBuilding an Alzheimer's-resistant brain
p284
aVmeans learning to speak Italian,
p285
aVmeeting new friends,
p286
aVreading a book,
p287
aVor listening to a great TED Talk.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd if, despite all of this, you are someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
p290
aVthere are three lessons I've learned from my grandmother
p291
aVand the dozens of people I've come to know living with this disease.
p292
aVDiagnosis doesn't mean you're dying tomorrow.
p293
aVKeep living.
p294
aVYou won't lose your emotional memory.
p295
aVYou'll still be able to understand love and joy.
p296
aVYou might not remember what I said five minutes ago,
p297
aVbut you'll remember how I made you feel.
p298
aVAnd you are more than what you can remember.
p299
aa(lp300
