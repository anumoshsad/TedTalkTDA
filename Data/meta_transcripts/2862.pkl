VAs you heard, I'm a physicist.
p4
aVAnd I think the way we talk about physics needs a little modification.
p5
aVI am from just down the road here; I don't live here anymore.
p6
aVBut coming from round here means that I have a northern nana,
p7
aVmy mum's mom.
p8
aVAnd Nana is very bright; she hasn't had much formal education,
p9
aVbut she's sharp.
p10
aVAnd when I was a second-year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge,
p11
aVI remember spending an afternoon at Nana's house in Urmston
p12
aVstudying quantum mechanics.
p13
aVAnd I had these folders open in front of me
p14
aVwith this, you know, hieroglyphics \u2014 let's be honest.
p15
aVAnd Nana came along, and she looked at this folder,
p16
aVand she said, "What's that?"
p17
aVI said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."
p18
aVAnd I tried to explain something about what was on the page.
p19
aVIt was to do with the nucleus and Einstein A and B coefficients.
p20
aVAnd Nana looked very impressed.
p21
aVAnd then she said, "Oh.
p22
aVWhat can you do when you know that?"
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
V"Don't know, ma'am."
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VI think I said something about computers,
p31
aVbecause it was all I could think of at the time.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut you can broaden that question out, because it's a very good question \u2014
p34
aV"What can you do when you know that?" when "that" is physics?
p35
aVAnd I've come to realize that when we talk about physics in society
p36
aVand our sort of image of it,
p37
aVwe don't include the things that we can do when we know that.
p38
aVOur perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift.
p39
aVNot only does it need a bit of a shift,
p40
aVbut sharing this different perspective matters for our society,
p41
aVand I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist and I'm biased
p42
aVand I think we're the most important people in the world.
p43
aVHonest.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, the image of physics \u2014 we've got an image problem, let's be honest \u2014
p46
aVit hasn't moved on much from this.
p47
aVThis is a very famous photograph that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.
p48
aVThis is when the great minds of physics were grappling
p49
aVwith the nature of determinism
p50
aVand what it means only to have a probability
p51
aVthat a particle might be somewhere,
p52
aVand whether any of it was real.
p53
aVAnd it was all very difficult.
p54
aVAnd you'll notice they're all very stern-looking men in suits.
p55
aVMarie Curie \u2014 I keep maybe saying, "Marie Antoinette,"
p56
aVwhich would be a turn-up for the books \u2014
p57
aVMarie Curie, third from the left on the bottom there,
p58
aVshe was allowed in, but had to dress like everybody else.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, this is what physics is like \u2014 there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,
p63
aVthese are to do with waves and particles.
p64
aVThat is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding,
p65
aVwhich makes it look worth watching, to be honest.
p66
aVI'm glad I didn't have to write the risk assessment
p67
aVfor whatever was going on there.
p68
aVThe point is: this is the image of physics, right?
p69
aVIt's weird and difficult,
p70
aVdone by slightly strange people dressed in a slightly strange way.
p71
aVIt's inaccessible, it's somewhere else
p72
aVand fundamentally, why should I care?
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd the problem with that is that I'm a physicist,
p75
aVand I study this.
p76
aVThis \u2014 this is my job, right?
p77
aVI study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.
p78
aVThe atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive,
p79
aVand the thin layer that joins them together
p80
aVis really important,
p81
aVbecause that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other.
p82
aVYou can see that the sea surface \u2014 that was me who took this video \u2014
p83
aVthe average height of those waves by the way, was 10 meters.
p84
aVSo this is definitely physics happening here \u2014
p85
aVthere's lots of things \u2014 this is definitely physics.
p86
aVAnd yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics,
p87
aVand that bothers me.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo what is included in our cultural perception of physics?
p90
aVBecause I'm a physicist, there has to be a graph, right?
p91
aVThat's allowed.
p92
aVWe've got time along the bottom here, from very fast things there,
p93
aVto things that take a long time over here.
p94
aVSmall things at the bottom, big things up there.
p95
aVSo, our current cultural image of physics looks like this.
p96
aVThere's quantum mechanics down in that corner,
p97
aVit's very small, it's very weird,
p98
aVit happens very quickly,
p99
aVand it's a long way down in the general ...
p100
aVon the scale of anything that matters for everyday life.
p101
aVAnd then there's cosmology, which is up there;
p102
aVvery large, very far away,
p103
aValso very weird.
p104
aVAnd if you go to some places
p105
aVlike black holes in the beginning of the universe,
p106
aVwe know that these are frontiers in physics, right?
p107
aVThere's lots of work being done to discover new physics
p108
aVin these places.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut the thing is, you will notice there's a very large gap in the middle.
p111
aVAnd in that gap, there are many things.
p112
aVThere are planets and toasts and volcanoes and clouds
p113
aVand clarinets and bubbles and dolphins
p114
aVand all sorts of things that make up our everyday life.
p115
aVAnd these are also run by physics, you'd be surprised \u2014
p116
aVthere is physics in the middle, it's just that nobody talks about it.
p117
aVAnd the thing about all of these is that they all run
p118
aVon a relatively small number of physical laws,
p119
aVthings like Newton's laws of motion,
p120
aVthermodynamics,
p121
aVsome rotational dynamics.
p122
aVThe physics in the middle applies over a huge range,
p123
aVfrom very, very small things to very, very big things.
p124
aVYou have to try very hard to get outside of this.
p125
aVAnd there is also a frontier in research physics here,
p126
aVit's just that nobody talks about it.
p127
aVThis is the world of the complex.
p128
aVWhen these laws work together, they bring about
p129
aVthe beautiful, messy, complex world we live in.
p130
aa(lp131
VFundamentally, this is the bit that really matters to me
p132
aVon an everyday basis.
p133
aVAnd this is the bit that we don't talk about.
p134
aVThere's plenty of physics research going on here.
p135
aVBut because it doesn't involve pointing at stars,
p136
aVpeople for some reason think it's not that.
p137
aVNow, the cool thing about this is that there are so many things
p138
aVin this middle bit,
p139
aVall following the same physical laws,
p140
aVthat we can see those laws at work
p141
aValmost all the time around us.
p142
aa(lp143
VI've got a little video here.
p144
aVSo the game is, one of these eggs is raw and one of them has been boiled.
p145
aVI want you to tell me which one is which.
p146
aVWhich one's raw?
p147
aa(lp148
V(Audience responds)
p149
aa(lp150
VThe one on the left \u2014 yes!
p151
aVAnd even though you might not have tried that, you all knew.
p152
aVThe reason for that is, you set them spinning,
p153
aVand when you stop the cooked egg, the one that's completely solid,
p154
aVyou stop the entire egg.
p155
aVWhen you stop the other one, you only stop the shell;
p156
aVthe liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop.
p157
aVAnd then it pushes the shell round again, so the egg starts to rotate again.
p158
aVThis is brilliant, right?
p159
aVIt's a demonstration of something in physics
p160
aVthat we call the law of conservation of angular momentum,
p161
aVwhich basically says that if you set something spinning
p162
aVabout a fixed axis,
p163
aVthat it will keep spinning unless you do something to stop it.
p164
aVAnd that's really fundamental in how the universe works.
p165
aVAnd it's not just eggs that it applies to,
p166
aValthough it's really useful if you're the sort of person \u2014
p167
aVand apparently, these people do exist \u2014
p168
aVwho will boil eggs and then put them back in the fridge.
p169
aVWho does that? Don't admit to it \u2014 it's OK. We won't judge you.
p170
aVBut it's also got much broader applicabilities.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is the Hubble Space Telescope.
p173
aVThe Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very tiny part of the sky.
p174
aVHubble has been floating in free space for 25 years,
p175
aVnot touching anything.
p176
aVAnd yet it can point to a tiny region of sky.
p177
aVFor 11 and a half days, it did it in sections,
p178
aVaccurately enough to take amazing images like this.
p179
aVSo the question is:
p180
aVHow does something that is not touching anything
p181
aVknow where it is?
p182
aVThe answer is that right in the middle of it, it has something
p183
aVthat, to my great disappointment, isn't a raw egg,
p184
aVbut basically does the same job.
p185
aVIt's got gyroscopes which are spinning,
p186
aVand because of the law of conservation of angular momentum,
p187
aVthey keep spinning with the same axis, indefinitely.
p188
aVHubble kind of rotates around them, and so it can orient itself.
p189
aVSo the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use,
p190
aValso explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology
p191
aVof our time.
p192
aVSo this is the fun bit of physics, that you learn these patterns
p193
aVand then you can apply them again and again and again.
p194
aVAnd it's really rewarding when you spot them in new places.
p195
aVThis is the fun of physics.
p196
aa(lp197
VI have shown that egg video to an audience full of businesspeople once
p198
aVand they were all dressed up very smartly and trying to impress their bosses.
p199
aVAnd I was running out of time, so I showed the egg video and then said,
p200
aV"Well, you can work it out, and ask me afterwards to check."
p201
aVThen I left the stage.
p202
aVAnd I had, literally,
p203
aVmiddle-aged grown men tugging on my sleeve afterwards,
p204
aVsaying, "Is it this? Is it this?"
p205
aVAnd when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VThe joy that you get from spotting these patterns
p210
aVdoesn't go away when you're an adult.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd that's really important,
p213
aVbecause physics is all about patterns,
p214
aVand a small number of patterns give you access
p215
aVto almost all of the physics in our everyday world.
p216
aVThe thing that's best about this is it involves playing with toys.
p217
aVThings like the egg shouldn't be dismissed as the mundane little things
p218
aVthat we just give the kids to play with on a Saturday afternoon
p219
aVto keep them quiet.
p220
aVThis is the stuff that actually really matters,
p221
aVbecause this is the laws of the universe and it applies to eggs
p222
aVand toast falling butter-side down and all sorts of other things,
p223
aVjust as much as it applies to modern technology
p224
aVand anything else that's going on in the world.
p225
aVSo I think we should play with these patterns.
p226
aa(lp227
VBasically, there are a small number of concepts
p228
aVthat you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen,
p229
aVthat are really useful for life in the outside world.
p230
aVIf you want to learn about thermodynamics, a duck is a good place to start,
p231
aVfor example, why their feet don't get cold.
p232
aVOnce you've got a bit of thermodynamics with the duck,
p233
aVyou can also explain fridges.
p234
aVMagnets that you can play with in your kitchen
p235
aVget you to wind turbines and modern energy generation.
p236
aVRaisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always a good thing to play with.
p237
aVIf you're at a boring party, fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,
p238
aVput them in some lemonade.
p239
aVIt's got three consequences.
p240
aVFirst thing is, it's quite good to watch; try it.
p241
aVSecondly, it sends the boring people away.
p242
aVThirdly, it brings the interesting people to you.
p243
aVYou win on all fronts.
p244
aVAnd then there's spin and gas laws and viscosity.
p245
aVThere's these little patterns, and they're right around us everywhere.
p246
aVAnd it's fundamentally democratic, right?
p247
aVEverybody has access to the same physics; you don't need a big, posh lab.
p248
aa(lp249
VWhen I wrote the book, I had the chapter on spin.
p250
aVI had written a bit about toast falling butter-side down.
p251
aVI gave the chapter to a friend of mine who's not a scientist,
p252
aVfor him to read and tell me what he thought,
p253
aVand he took the chapter away.
p254
aVHe was working overseas.
p255
aVI got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later,
p256
aVand it said, "I'm at breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland,
p257
aVand I really want to push toast off the table,
p258
aVbecause I don't believe what you wrote."
p259
aVAnd that was the good bit \u2014 he doesn't have to.
p260
aVHe can push the toast off the table and try it for himself.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd so there's two important things to know about science:
p263
aVthe fundamental laws we've learned through experience and experimentation,
p264
aVwork.
p265
aVThe day we drop an apple and it goes up,
p266
aVthen we'll have a debate about gravity.
p267
aVUp to that point, we basically know how gravity works,
p268
aVand we can learn the framework.
p269
aVThen there's the process of experimentation:
p270
aVhaving confidence in things, trying things out,
p271
aVcritical thinking \u2014 how we move science forward \u2014
p272
aVand you can learn both of those things
p273
aVby playing with toys in the everyday world.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd it's really important,
p276
aVbecause there's all this talk about technology,
p277
aVwe've heard talks about quantum computing
p278
aVand all these mysterious, far-off things.
p279
aVBut fundamentally, we still live in bodies that are about this size,
p280
aVwe still walk about, sit on chairs that are about this size,
p281
aVwe still live in the physical world.
p282
aVAnd being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless.
p283
aVAnd I think it's really important that we're not helpless,
p284
aVthat society feels it can look at things,
p285
aVbecause this isn't about knowing all the answers.
p286
aVIt's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions.
p287
aVAnd by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life,
p288
aVwe gain the confidence to ask the right questions.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo, there's a bigger thing.
p291
aVIn answer to Nana's question
p292
aVabout what can you do when you know that \u2014
p293
aVbecause there's lots of stuff in the everyday world
p294
aVthat you can do when you know that,
p295
aVespecially if you've got eggs in the fridge \u2014
p296
aVthere's a much deeper answer.
p297
aVAnd so there's all the fun and the curiosity
p298
aVthat you could have playing with toys.
p299
aVBy the way \u2014 why should kids have all the fun, right?
p300
aVAll of us can have fun playing with toys,
p301
aVand we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
p302
aVYou can blame me, it's fine.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo when it comes to reasons for studying physics, for example,
p305
aVhere is the best reason I can think of:
p306
aVI think that each of us has three life-support systems.
p307
aVWe've got our own body, we've got a planet
p308
aVand we've got our civilization.
p309
aVEach of those is an independent life-support system,
p310
aVkeeping us alive in its own way.
p311
aVAnd they all run on the fundamental physical laws
p312
aVthat you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and teacups and lemonade,
p313
aVand everything else you can play with.
p314
aVThis is the reason, for example,
p315
aVwhy something like climate change is such a serious problem,
p316
aVbecause It's two of these life-support systems,
p317
aVour planet and our civilization,
p318
aVkind of butting up against each other;
p319
aVthey're in conflict, and we need to negotiate that boundary.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd the fundamental physical laws that we can learn
p322
aVthat are the way the world around us works,
p323
aVare the tools at the basis of everything;
p324
aVthey're the foundation.
p325
aVThere's lots of things to know about in life,
p326
aVbut knowing the foundations is going to get you a long way.
p327
aVAnd I think this, if you're not interested in having fun with physics
p328
aVor anything like that \u2014 strange, but apparently, these people exist \u2014
p329
aVyou surely are interested in keeping yourself alive
p330
aVand in how our life-support systems work.
p331
aVThe framework for physics is remarkably constant;
p332
aVit's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure.
p333
aVIt's not going to change anytime soon.
p334
aVThey might discover some new quantum mechanics,
p335
aVbut apples right here are still going to fall down.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo, the question is \u2014
p338
aVI get asked sometimes: How do you start?
p339
aVWhat's the place to start
p340
aVif you're interested in the physical world, in not being helpless,
p341
aVand in finding some toys to play with?
p342
aVHere is my suggestion to you:
p343
aVthe place to start is that moment \u2014 and adults do this \u2014
p344
aVyou're drifting along somewhere,
p345
aVand you spot something and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."
p346
aVAnd then your consciousness goes, "You're an adult. Keep going."
p347
aVAnd that's the point \u2014 hold that thought \u2014
p348
aVthat bit where your brain went, "Oh, that's a bit odd,"
p349
aVbecause there's something there to play with,
p350
aVand it's worth you playing with it,
p351
aVso that's the place to start.
p352
aa(lp353
VBut if you don't have any of those little moments
p354
aVon your way home from this event,
p355
aVhere are some things to start with.
p356
aVPut raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; highly entertaining.
p357
aVWatch a coffee spill dry.
p358
aVI know that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry,
p359
aVbut it does do quite weird things; it's worth watching.
p360
aVI'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around.
p361
aVThere are so many things you can do to play with teacups, it's brilliant.
p362
aVThe most obvious one is to get a teacup, get a spoon,
p363
aVtap the teacup around the rim and listen,
p364
aVand you will hear something strange.
p365
aVAnd the other thing is, push your toast off the table
p366
aVbecause you can, and you'll learn stuff from it.
p367
aVAnd if you're feeling really ambitious,
p368
aVtry and push it off in such a way that it doesn't fall butter-side down,
p369
aVwhich is possible.
p370
aa(lp371
VThe point of all of this is that,
p372
aVfirst of all, we should all play with toys.
p373
aVWe shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves
p374
aVwith the tools around us,
p375
aVbecause we all have access to them.
p376
aVIt matters, because if we want to understand society,
p377
aVif we want to be good citizens,
p378
aVwe need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based.
p379
aa(lp380
VPlaying with toys is great.
p381
aVUnderstanding how to keep our life-support systems going is great.
p382
aVBut fundamentally, the thing that we need to change
p383
aVin the way that we talk about physics,
p384
aVis we need to understand
p385
aVthat physics isn't out there with weird people
p386
aVand strange hieroglyphics
p387
aVfor somebody else in a posh lab.
p388
aVPhysics is right here; it's for us, and we can all play with it.
