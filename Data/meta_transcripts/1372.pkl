VThe oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.
p4
aVAnd I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right
p5
aVwhen he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet
p6
aVPlanet Ocean.
p7
aVAnd the oceans are hugely productive,
p8
aVas you can see by the satellite image
p9
aVof photosynthesis, the production of new life.
p10
aVIn fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth
p11
aVas well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.
p12
aVIn addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,
p13
aVand much of it we don't know about.
p14
aVBut I'll tell you some of that today.
p15
aVThat also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction
p16
aVthat we do from the ocean.
p17
aVThat's about 10 percent of our global needs
p18
aVand 100 percent of some island nations.
p19
aa(lp20
VIf you were to descend
p21
aVinto the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable,
p22
aVit would quickly become pitch black,
p23
aVinterrupted only by pinpoints of light
p24
aVfrom bioluminescent organisms.
p25
aVAnd if you turn the lights on,
p26
aVyou might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,
p27
aVbecause those are the denizens of the deep,
p28
aVthe things that live in the deep ocean.
p29
aVAnd eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.
p30
aVThis type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface
p31
aVthan all other habitats combined.
p32
aVAnd yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars
p33
aVthan we do about this habitat,
p34
aVdespite the fact that we have yet to extract
p35
aVa gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water
p36
aVfrom those bodies.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd so 10 years ago,
p39
aVan international program began called the Census of Marine Life,
p40
aVwhich set out to try and improve our understanding
p41
aVof life in the global oceans.
p42
aVIt involved 17 different projects around the world.
p43
aVAs you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.
p44
aVAnd I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage
p45
aVthat it managed to achieve.
p46
aVIt all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,
p47
aVmet in Woods Hole, Massachusetts
p48
aVwhere both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.
p49
aVAnd Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity
p50
aVand the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.
p51
aVWell, from that discussion grew this program
p52
aVthat involved 2,700 scientists
p53
aVfrom more than 80 countries around the world
p54
aVwho engaged in 540 ocean expeditions
p55
aVat a combined cost of 650 million dollars
p56
aVto study the distribution, diversity and abundance
p57
aVof life in the global ocean.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so what did we find?
p60
aVWe found spectacular new species,
p61
aVthe most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked \u2014
p62
aVfrom the shoreline to the abyss,
p63
aVform microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.
p64
aVAnd the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,
p65
aVbut rather the taxonomic specialists
p66
aVwho can identify and catalog these species
p67
aVthat became the limiting step.
p68
aVThey, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.
p69
aVThere are actually four to five new species
p70
aVdescribed everyday for the oceans.
p71
aVAnd as I say, it could be a much larger number.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I come from Newfoundland in Canada \u2014
p74
aVIt's an island off the east coast of that continent \u2014
p75
aVwhere we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters
p76
aVin human history.
p77
aVAnd so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.
p78
aVIt's around 1900.
p79
aVNow, when I was a boy of about his age,
p80
aVI would go out fishing with my grandfather
p81
aVand we would catch fish about half that size.
p82
aVAnd I thought that was the norm,
p83
aVbecause I had never seen fish like this.
p84
aVIf you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,
p85
aVif you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,
p86
aVit would be half that size still.
p87
aVSo what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.
p88
aVOur expectations of what the oceans can produce
p89
aVis something that we don't really appreciate
p90
aVbecause we haven't seen it in our lifetimes.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow most of us, and I would say me included,
p93
aVthink that human exploitation of the oceans
p94
aVreally only became very serious
p95
aVin the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.
p96
aVThe census actually tried to look back in time,
p97
aVusing every source of information they could get their hands on.
p98
aVAnd so anything from restaurant menus
p99
aVto monastery records to ships' logs
p100
aVto see what the oceans looked like.
p101
aVBecause science data really goes back
p102
aVto, at best, World War II, for the most part.
p103
aVAnd so what they found, in fact,
p104
aVis that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.
p105
aVAnd so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.
p106
aVSo fishermen could only catch
p107
aVwhat they could either eat or sell that day.
p108
aVBut the Romans developed salting.
p109
aVAnd with salting,
p110
aVit became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.
p111
aVAnd so began industrial fishing.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have
p114
aVof what sort of loss we've had
p115
aVrelative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.
p116
aVThey range from 65 to 98 percent
p117
aVfor these major groups of organisms,
p118
aVas shown in the dark blue bars.
p119
aVNow for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect \u2014
p120
aVfor example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds \u2014
p121
aVthere is some recovery.
p122
aVSo it's not all hopeless.
p123
aVBut for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
p126
aVIt's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.
p127
aVAnd so this is a photograph from the 1950s.
p128
aVI want you to notice the scale on the slide,
p129
aVbecause when you see the same picture from the 1980s,
p130
aVwe see the fish are much smaller
p131
aVand we're also seeing a change
p132
aVin terms of the composition of those fish.
p133
aVBy 2007, the catch was actually laughable
p134
aVin terms of the size for a trophy fish.
p135
aVBut this is no laughing matter.
p136
aVThe oceans have lost a lot of their productivity
p137
aVand we're responsible for it.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo what's left? Actually quite a lot.
p140
aVThere's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.
p141
aVAnd I want to start with a bit on technology,
p142
aVbecause, of course, this is a TED Conference
p143
aVand you want to hear something on technology.
p144
aVSo one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean
p145
aVare remotely operated vehicles.
p146
aVSo these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor
p147
aVwhere they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.
p148
aVSo a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise
p149
aVand I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict.
p150
aVBut through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home
p151
aVwith my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,
p152
aVand I could tell the pilot, "I want a sample right there."
p153
aVAnd that's exactly what the pilot did for me.
p154
aVThat's the sort of technology that's available today
p155
aVthat really wasn't available even a decade ago.
p156
aVSo it allows us to sample these amazing habitats
p157
aVthat are very far from the surface
p158
aVand very far from light.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans
p161
aVis acoustics, or sound waves.
p162
aVAnd the advantage of sound waves
p163
aVis that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.
p164
aVAnd so we can send out sound waves,
p165
aVthey bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.
p166
aVAnd so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.
p167
aVOne would send out sound waves that would bounce back.
p168
aVThey would be received by a second ship,
p169
aVand that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,
p170
aVof 250 billion herring
p171
aVin a period of about a minute.
p172
aVAnd that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.
p173
aVAnd to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,
p174
aVbecause knowing how many fish are there is really critical.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe can also use satellite tags
p177
aVto track animals as they move through the oceans.
p178
aVAnd so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,
p179
aVsuch as this elephant seal,
p180
aVit's an opportunity to send data back to shore
p181
aVand tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.
p182
aVAnd so from that we can produce these tracks.
p183
aVFor example, the dark blue
p184
aVshows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.
p185
aVNow I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,
p186
aVbut stick with me nonetheless.
p187
aa(lp188
VFor animals that don't surface,
p189
aVwe have something called pop-up tags,
p190
aVwhich collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.
p191
aVAnd then at some period of time
p192
aVit pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.
p193
aVBecause GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.
p194
aVAnd so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,
p195
aVthese hot spots in the ocean,
p196
aVthat should be real priority areas
p197
aVfor ocean conservation.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow one of the other things that you may think about
p200
aVis that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.
p201
aVAnd so there's a barcode on that product
p202
aVthat tells the computer exactly what the product is.
p203
aVGeneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.
p204
aVAnd what barcoding does
p205
aVis use a specific gene called CO1
p206
aVthat's consistent within a species, but varies among species.
p207
aVAnd so what that means is we can unambiguously identify
p208
aVwhich species are which
p209
aVeven if they look similar to each other,
p210
aVbut may be biologically quite different.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this
p213
aVis the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,
p214
aVwho worked with the census.
p215
aVThey went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City
p216
aVand they barcoded it.
p217
aVWell what they found was mislabeled fish.
p218
aVSo for example,
p219
aVthey found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,
p220
aVwas in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.
p221
aVThey also found an endangered species
p222
aVsold as a common one.
p223
aVSo barcoding allows us to know what we're working with
p224
aVand also what we're eating.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe Ocean Biogeographic Information System
p227
aVis the database for all the census data.
p228
aVIt's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.
p229
aVAnd it contains all the data from the census
p230
aVplus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.
p231
aVAnd so what you can do with that
p232
aVis to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.
p233
aVWhat I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.
p234
aVThis is where our sampling effort has concentrated.
p235
aVNow what you can see
p236
aVis we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,
p237
aVin the North Sea in particular,
p238
aVand also the east coast of North America fairly well.
p239
aVThat's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.
p240
aVThe cold colors, the blue and the black,
p241
aVshow areas where we have almost no data.
p242
aVSo even after a 10-year census,
p243
aVthere are large areas that still remain unexplored.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico
p246
aVwho decided really as a labor of love
p247
aVto pull together all the knowledge they could
p248
aVabout biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.
p249
aVAnd so they put this together, a list of all the species,
p250
aVwhere they're known to occur,
p251
aVand it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.
p252
aVBut then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.
p253
aVSo all of a sudden, this labor of love
p254
aVfor no obvious economic reason
p255
aVhas become a critical piece of information
p256
aVin terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take
p257
aVand how the lawsuits
p258
aVand the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years
p259
aVare likely to be resolved.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo what did we find?
p262
aVWell, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.
p263
aVBut I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries
p264
aVfrom the census.
p265
aVSo one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?
p266
aVWhere do we find the most species of ocean life?
p267
aVAnd what we find if we plot up the well-known species
p268
aVis this sort of a distribution.
p269
aVAnd what we see is that for coastal tags,
p270
aVfor those organisms that live near the shoreline,
p271
aVthey're most diverse in the tropics.
p272
aVThis is something we've actually known for a while,
p273
aVso it's not a real breakthrough.
p274
aa(lp275
VWhat is really exciting though
p276
aVis that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,
p277
aVare actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.
p278
aVThis is the sort of data, again, that managers could use
p279
aVif they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.
p280
aVYou can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.
p281
aVAnd that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow while a lot of the species we discovered in the census
p284
aVare things that are small and hard to see,
p285
aVthat certainly wasn't always the case.
p286
aVFor example, while it's hard to believe
p287
aVthat a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,
p288
aVit did until a few years ago
p289
aVwhen South African fishermen requested an export permit
p290
aVand scientists realized that this was something new to science.
p291
aVSimilarly this Golden V kelp
p292
aVcollected in Alaska just below the low water mark
p293
aVis probably a new species.
p294
aVEven though it's three meters long,
p295
aVit actually, again, eluded science.
p296
aVNow this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.
p297
aVBut to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,
p298
aVso it was a lot harder to find.
p299
aVBut there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
p300
aVThis particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,
p301
aVit's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago \u2014
p302
aVat least it was, until the census discovered
p303
aVit was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
p304
aVAnd it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,
p305
aVcan hide secrets for a very long time.
p306
aVSo, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out.
p307
aa(lp308
VIf we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.
p309
aVAnd so one of the records that we had
p310
aVwas this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations
p311
aVall the way from New Zealand
p312
aVall the way up to Alaska and back again
p313
aVin search of endless summer
p314
aVas they complete their life cycles.
p315
aVWe also talked about the White Shark Cafe.
p316
aVThis is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.
p317
aVWe don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.
p318
aVThat's a question for the future.
p319
aa(lp320
VOne of the things that we're taught in high school
p321
aVis that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
p322
aVNow this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,
p323
aVnot terribly charismatic.
p324
aVBut it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
p325
aVBut the really interesting thing about it
p326
aVis that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered
p327
aVthat this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments
p328
aVin the deep Mediterranean Sea.
p329
aVSo now they know that, in fact,
p330
aVanimals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,
p331
aVand that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions.
p332
aa(lp333
VIf you were to suck all the water out of the ocean,
p334
aVthis is what you'd be left behind with,
p335
aVand that's the biomass of life on the sea floor.
p336
aVNow what we see is huge biomass towards the poles
p337
aVand not much biomass in between.
p338
aVWe found life in the extremes.
p339
aVAnd so there were new species that were found
p340
aVthat live inside ice
p341
aVand help to support an ice-based food web.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd we also found this spectacular yeti crab
p344
aVthat lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island.
p345
aVAnd this particular species
p346
aVreally captured the public's attention.
p347
aVWe also found the deepest vents known yet \u2014 5,000 meters \u2014
p348
aVthe hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius \u2014
p349
aVvents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic
p350
aVwhere none had been found before.
p351
aVSo even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow in terms of the unknowns, there are many.
p354
aVAnd I'm just going to summarize just a few of them
p355
aVvery quickly for you.
p356
aVFirst of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?
p357
aVWe actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean
p358
aVother than marine mammals.
p359
aVAnd so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery
p360
aVhow many more species we're likely to discover.
p361
aVAnd from that, we actually calculate
p362
aVthat we know about 16,500 marine species
p363
aVand there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.
p364
aVSo we've done pretty well.
p365
aVWe've got about 75 percent of the fish,
p366
aVmaybe as much as 90 percent.
p367
aVBut the fishes, as I say, are the best known.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.
p370
aVNow this figure is actually based on a brand new paper
p371
aVthat's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.
p372
aVAnd what is does is predict how many more species there are
p373
aVon land and in the ocean.
p374
aVAnd what they found
p375
aVis that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.
p376
aVThat means 91 percent, even after the census,
p377
aVstill remain to be discovered.
p378
aVAnd so that turns out to be about two million species
p379
aVonce all is said and done.
p380
aVSo we still have quite a lot of work to do
p381
aVin terms of unknowns.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow this bacterium
p384
aVis part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.
p385
aVAnd these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.
p386
aVAnd so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.
p387
aVBut you can imagine the biomass that represents.
p388
aVBut the really intriguing thing about the microbes
p389
aVis just how diverse they are.
p390
aVA single drop of seawater
p391
aVcould contain 160 different types of microbes.
p392
aVAnd the oceans themselves
p393
aVare thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.
p394
aVSo that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?
p395
aVWe actually don't know.
p396
aa(lp397
VThe most exciting thing, I would say, about this census
p398
aVis the role of global science.
p399
aVAnd so as we see in this image of light during the night,
p400
aVthere are lots of areas of the Earth
p401
aVwhere human development is much greater
p402
aVand other areas where it's much less,
p403
aVbut between them we see large dark areas
p404
aVof relatively unexplored ocean.
p405
aVThe other point I'd like to make about this
p406
aVis that this ocean's interconnected.
p407
aVMarine organisms do not care about international boundaries;
p408
aVthey move where they will.
p409
aVAnd so the importance then of global collaboration
p410
aVbecomes all the more important.
p411
aa(lp412
VWe've lost a lot of paradise.
p413
aVFor example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea
p414
aVare now effectively gone.
p415
aVThere were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,
p416
aVwhich collected more garbage than they did animals.
p417
aVAnd that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be
p418
aVamong the most pristine left on Earth.
p419
aVAnd there are a lot of other pressures.
p420
aVOcean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,
p421
aVas well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.
p422
aVOn the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,
p423
aVwe're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,
p426
aVgoing through this litany of concerns about the ocean,
p427
aVbut I want to end on a more positive note.
p428
aVAnd so the grand challenge then
p429
aVis to try and make sure that we preserve what's left,
p430
