VSo, what I'm going to do is
p4
aVjust give you the latest episode of India's \u2014
p5
aVmaybe the world's \u2014 longest running soap opera,
p6
aVwhich is cricket.
p7
aVAnd may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.
p8
aVIt's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:
p9
aVIt's got love, joy, happiness,
p10
aVsadness, tears, laughter,
p11
aVlots of deceit, intrigue.
p12
aVAnd like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years
p13
aVwhen the audience interest changes.
p14
aVAnd that's exactly what cricket has done.
p15
aVIt's jumped 20 years
p16
aVinto 20-over game.
p17
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk about,
p18
aVhow a small change
p19
aVleads to a very big revolution.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut it wasn't always like that.
p22
aVCricket wasn't always this
p23
aVspeed-driven generations game.
p24
aVThere was a time when you played cricket,
p25
aVyou played timeless test matches,
p26
aVwhen you played on till the game got over.
p27
aVAnd there was this game in March 1939
p28
aVthat started on the third of March
p29
aVand ended on the 14th of March.
p30
aVAnd it only ended because the English cricketers
p31
aVhad to go from Durban to Cape Town,
p32
aVwhich is a two-hour train journey,
p33
aVto catch the ship that left on the 17th,
p34
aVbecause the next ship wasn't around for a long time.
p35
aVSo, the match was ended in between.
p36
aVAnd one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?
p37
aVAnother half an hour and we would have won."
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVAnother half an hour after 12 days.
p40
aVThere were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,
p41
aVso you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,
p42
aVso they all sat around making friends with each other.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:
p45
aVbecause we had about the same pace of life.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVThe Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?
p48
aVYou fought by day, then it was sunset,
p49
aVso everyone went back home.
p50
aVAnd then you worked out your strategy,
p51
aVand you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
p52
aVThe only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was
p53
aVthat in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
p54
aVPrinces patronize the game,
p55
aVnot because they love the game,
p56
aVbut because it was a means of ingratiating themselves
p57
aVto the British rulers.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,
p60
aVwhich was, all you needed was a plank of wood
p61
aVand a rubber ball, and any number of people
p62
aVcould play it anywhere.
p63
aVTake a look:
p64
aVYou could play it in the dump
p65
aVwith some rocks over there,
p66
aVyou could play it in a little alley \u2014
p67
aVyou couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;
p68
aVdon't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVYou could play it on the banks of the Ganges \u2014
p71
aVthat's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
p72
aVOr you could play many games in one small patch of land,
p73
aVeven if you didn't know which game you were actually in.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVAs you can see, you can play anywhere.
p76
aVBut slowly the game moved on,
p77
aVyou know, finally.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou don't always have five days. So, we moved on,
p80
aVand we started playing 50-over cricket.
p81
aVAnd then an enormous accident took place.
p82
aVIn Indian sport we don't make things happen,
p83
aVaccidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
p84
aVAnd we won this World Cup in 1983.
p85
aVAnd suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,
p86
aVand we played it virtually every day.
p87
aVThere was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut there was another big date.
p90
aV1983 was when we won the World Cup.
p91
aV1991,'92, we found a finance minister
p92
aVand a prime minister
p93
aVwilling to let the world look at India,
p94
aVrather than be this great country of intrigue
p95
aVand mystery in this closed country.
p96
aVAnd so we allowed multinationals into India.
p97
aVWe cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,
p98
aVand we got all the multinationals coming in,
p99
aVwith multinational budgets,
p100
aVwho looked at per-capita income
p101
aVand got very excited about the possibilities in India,
p102
aVand were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd there are only two vehicles in India \u2014 one real, one scripted.
p105
aVThe scripted one is what you see in the movies,
p106
aVthe real one was cricket.
p107
aVAnd so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,
p108
aVRavi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it
p109
aVall over the world.
p110
aVAnd Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
p111
aVAnd so cricket started becoming big;
p112
aVcricket started bringing riches in.
p113
aVTelevision started covering cricket. For a long time
p114
aVtelevision said, "We won't cover cricket
p115
aVunless you pay us to cover it."
p116
aVThen they said, "OK,
p117
aVthe next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.
p118
aVThe next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."
p119
aVSo, it's a bit of a curve, that.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd then another big accident happened in our cricket.
p122
aVEngland invented 20 overs cricket,
p123
aVand said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
p124
aVJust as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.
p125
aVThank God for them.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVAnd so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.
p128
aVIndia didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.
p129
aVBut we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.
p130
aVAnd then something very dramatic happened.
p131
aVWe got to the final, and then this moment,
p132
aVthat will remain enshrined forever,
p133
aVfor everybody, take a look.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Crowd cheering)
p136
aa(lp137
VThe Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnnouncer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!
p140
aVWhat a match for a Twenty20 final.
p141
aVIndia, the world champions.
p142
aV(Cheering)
p143
aVIndia, T20 champions.
p144
aVBut what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni
p145
aVgot it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.
p146
aVA massive, massive success:
p147
aVIndia, the world TT champions.
p148
aa(lp149
VHarsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
p150
aVThe accident, of course, there, was that the batsman
p151
aVthought the bowler was bowling fast.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVIf he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,
p154
aVbut it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered
p155
aVthat we could be good at this game.
p156
aVAnd what it also did was
p157
aVit led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.
p158
aVIt was at a time when investment was coming in,
p159
aVIndia was feeling a little more confident about itself.
p160
aVAnd so there was a feeling that there was great pride
p161
aVin what we can do.
p162
aVAnd thankfully for all of us,
p163
aVthe English are very good at inventing things,
p164
aVand then the gracious people that they are,
p165
aVthey let the world become very good at it.
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVAnd so England invented T20 cricket,
p168
aVand allowed India to hijack it.
p169
aVIt was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,
p170
aVwe just took it straight away, as is.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd so, we launched our own T20 league.
p174
aVSix weeks, city versus city.
p175
aVIt was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country \u2014
p176
aVthe only two areas in which India was very proud about
p177
aVtheir country, representing itself on the field.
p178
aVOne was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.
p179
aVThe other was Indian cricket.
p180
aVNow, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
p181
aVBut the people getting into these city leagues
p182
aVwere people who were taking their cues from the West.
p183
aVAmerica is a home of leagues. And they said,
p184
aV"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."
p185
aVBut was India ready for it?
p186
aVBecause cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
p187
aVIt was never promoted, it was never sold \u2014 it was organized.
p188
aVAnd look what they did with our beautiful, nice,
p189
aVsimple family game.
p190
aVAll of a sudden, you had that happening.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Music)
p193
aa(lp194
VAn opening ceremony to match every other.
p195
aVThis was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.
p196
aVThis was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month
p197
aVthan New Zealand's population twice over.
p198
aVSo, it was a different India.
p199
aVBut it was also a slightly more orthodox India
p200
aVthat was very happy to be modern,
p201
aVbut didn't want to say that to people.
p202
aVAnd so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.
p203
aVEveryone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Music)
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VThe new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
p210
aVThey were not bureaucrats who were forced
p211
aVinto sport because they didn't actually love it;
p212
aVthese were people who ran serious companies.
p213
aVAnd so they started promoting cricket big time,
p214
aVstarted promoting clubs big time.
p215
aVAnd they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.
p216
aVI mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars
p217
aVbefore a ball was bowled,
p218
aV1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,
p219
aVand another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises
p220
aVthat were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,
p221
aVbut they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.
p222
aVBut what they were very good at doing
p223
aVwas making it very localized.
p224
aVSo, just to give you an example of how they did it \u2014
p225
aVnot Manchester United style promotion,
p226
aVbut very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Music)
p229
aa(lp230
VOf course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVBut that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
p233
aVAll along, if you wanted a young cricketer,
p234
aVyou picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,
p235
aVyour own city, and you were very proud
p236
aVof the system that produced those cricketers.
p237
aVNow, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot \u2014
p238
aVif Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,
p239
aVthey needn't go to Kalbadevi
p240
aVor Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,
p241
aVthey could go to Trinidad.
p242
aVThis was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,
p243
aVwhere you can source from anywhere
p244
aVas long as you get the best product at the best price.
p245
aVAnd all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality
p246
aVthat you can source the best product for the best price
p247
aVanywhere in the world.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,
p250
aVovernight. And when he had to go back to represent
p251
aVthe West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"
p252
aVHe said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."
p253
aVWe said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;
p254
aVit's about when do you have to reach there?"
p255
aVAnd so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."
p256
aVAnd they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."
p257
aVSo, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,
p258
aVwent from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,
p259
aVsat in a private corporate jet \u2014 first refueling in Portugal,
p260
aVsecond refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVNever would India have thought on this scale before.
p263
aVNever would India have said, "I want a player to play
p264
aVone game for me, and I will use a corporate jet
p265
aVto send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica
p266
aVto play a game."
p267
aVAnd I just thought to myself,
p268
aV"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?
p269
aVWe have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."
p270
aa(lp271
VBut what this also did was it started
p272
aVmarrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,
p273
aVwhich is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
p274
aVThere is cricket and the movies.
p275
aVAnd they came together because people in the movies
p276
aVnow started owning clubs.
p277
aVAnd so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.
p278
aVThey started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
p279
aVAnd something very interesting happened.
p280
aVWe started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
p281
aVAnd so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
p282
aVAnd of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team \u2014
p283
aVas you will see on the clip that follows \u2014 if you did well,
p284
aVyou got a hug from Preity Zinta.
p285
aVSo that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look \u2014
p286
aVeveryone's watching Preity Zinta.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Music)
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.
p291
aVWe'd all seen matches in Kolkata,
p292
aVbut we'd never seen anything like this:
p293
aVShah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up
p294
aVfor Kolkata \u2014 not for India, but for Kolkata.
p295
aVBut take a look at this.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Music)
p298
aa(lp299
VAn Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer
p300
aVbecause they'd won in Kolkata.
p301
aVCan you imagine?
p302
aVAnd do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?
p303
aV(Applause)
p304
aV"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VBut I thought I'd take this opportunity \u2014
p309
aVthere's a few people from Pakistan in here.
p310
aVI'm so happy that you're here
p311
aVbecause I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?
p312
aVWe can play cricket together, we can be friends.
p313
aVSo thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VThere was criticism too because they said,
p318
aV"Players are being bought and sold?
p319
aVAre they grain?
p320
aVAre they cattle?"
p321
aVBecause we had this auction, you see.
p322
aVHow do you fix a price for a player?
p323
aVAnd so the auction that followed
p324
aVliterally had people saying,
p325
aV"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."
p326
aVThere it is.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Music)
p329
aa(lp330
VAuctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.
p331
aVShane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.
p332
aa(lp333
VHB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day \u2014
p334
aVso 250 rupees for a test match,
p335
aVbut if you finish in four days you only got 200.
p336
aVThe best Indian players who played every test match \u2014
p337
aVevery one of the internationals, the top of the line players \u2014
p338
aVstandard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.
p339
aVNow they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.
p340
aVThen Andrew Flintoff came by from England,
p341
aVhe got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,
p342
aV"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,
p343
aVand I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."
p344
aVAnd where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.
p345
aVCould you have imagined that day would come?
p346
aVOne and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.
p347
aVThat's not bad, is it?
p348
aa(lp349
VSo, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.
p350
aVWhat India was doing, though, was benchmarking
p351
aVitself against the best in the world,
p352
aVand it became a huge brand.
p353
aVLalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.
p354
aVIPL became the biggest brand in India
p355
aVand, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,
p356
aVand we had to start the tournament in three weeks.
p357
aVMove a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.
p358
aVBut we did it. You know why?
p359
aVBecause no country works as slowly as we do
p360
aVtill three weeks before an event,
p361
aVand nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VOur population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,
p366
aVsuddenly became our biggest asset
p367
aVbecause there were more people watching \u2014
p368
aVthe huge consuming class \u2014
p369
aVeverybody came to watch the cricket.
p370
aVWe'd also made cricket the only sport in India,
p371
aVwhich is a pity, but in India every other sport
p372
aVpushes cricket to become big,
p373
aVwhich is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
p374
aa(lp375
VNow, this last minute before I go \u2014
p376
aVthere's a couple of side effects of all this.
p377
aVFor a long time, India was this country of poverty,
p378
aVdust, beggars,
p379
aVsnake charmers, filth,
p380
aVDelhi belly \u2014 people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
p381
aVAnd, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
p382
aVCricketers all over the world said,
p383
aV"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
p384
aVAnd that felt good, you know?
p385
aVWe said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
p386
aVCan you imagine, you've got the dollar on view
p387
aVand there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
p388
aVThere's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,
p389
aVeverybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
p390
aa(lp391
VRight so, finally,
p392
aVan English game that India usurped a little bit,
p393
aVbut T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
p394
aVIf you want to take the game around the world,
p395
aVit's got to be the shortest form of the game.
p396
aVYou can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,
p397
aVor you can't take it all over the world.
p398
aVSo that's what T20 is doing.
p399
aVHopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger
p400
aVand hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
p401
aa(lp402
