VOnce there was a star.
p4
aVLike everything else, she was born;
p5
aVgrew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun
p6
aVand lived for a very long time.
p7
aVExactly how long,
p8
aVpeople cannot really tell.
p9
aVJust like everything in life,
p10
aVshe reached the end of her regular star days
p11
aVwhen her heart, the core of her life,
p12
aVexhausted its fuel.
p13
aVBut that was no end.
p14
aa(lp15
VShe transformed into a supernova, and in the process
p16
aVreleasing a tremendous amount of energy,
p17
aVoutshining the rest of the galaxy
p18
aVand emitting, in one second,
p19
aVthe same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days.
p20
aVAnd she evolved into another role in our galaxy.
p21
aa(lp22
VSupernova explosions are very extreme.
p23
aVBut the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme.
p24
aVIn the process of becoming a supernova,
p25
aVthe interior of the star collapses under its own weight
p26
aVand it starts rotating ever faster,
p27
aVlike an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body.
p28
aVIn that way, it starts rotating very fast and it increases, powerfully,
p29
aVits magnetic field.
p30
aVThe matter around the star is dragged around,
p31
aVand some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter
p32
aVand the magnetic field is increased even further.
p33
aVIn that way, our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy
p34
aVin brightness and gamma ray emission.
p35
aa(lp36
VMy star, the one in my story,
p37
aVbecame what is known as a magnetar.
p38
aVAnd just for your information,
p39
aVthe magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times
p40
aVthe magnetic field of Earth.
p41
aVThe most energetic events ever measured by astronomers
p42
aVcarry the name gamma-ray bursts
p43
aVbecause we observe them as bursts most or explosions,
p44
aVmost strongly measured as gamma-ray light.
p45
aVOur star, like the one in our story that became a magnetar,
p46
aVis detected as a gamma-ray burst
p47
aVduring the most energetic portion of the explosion.
p48
aVYet, even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events
p49
aVever measured by astronomers,
p50
aVwe cannot see them with our naked eye.
p51
aVWe depend, we rely on other methods
p52
aVin order to study this gamma-ray light.
p53
aVWe cannot see them with our naked eye.
p54
aVWe can only see an itty bitty, tiny portion
p55
aVof the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light.
p56
aVAnd beyond that, we rely on other methods.
p57
aa(lp58
VYet as astronomers, we study a wider range of light
p59
aVand we depend on other methods to do that.
p60
aVOn the screen, it may look like this.
p61
aVYou're seeing a plot.
p62
aVThat is a light curve.
p63
aVIt's a plot of intensity of light over time.
p64
aVIt is a gamma-ray light curve.
p65
aVSighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot
p66
aVin order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time.
p67
aVOn the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst,
p68
aVand on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst.
p69
aa(lp70
VEarly during my career, I could also see this kind of plot.
p71
aVBut then, I lost my sight.
p72
aVI completely lost my sight because of extended illness,
p73
aVand with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot
p74
aVand the opportunity to do my physics.
p75
aVIt was a very strong transition for me in many ways.
p76
aVAnd professionally, it left me without a way to do my science.
p77
aVI longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light
p78
aVand figure out the astrophysical cause.
p79
aVI wanted to experience the spacious wonder, the excitement,
p80
aVthe joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event.
p81
aa(lp82
VI thought long and hard about it,
p83
aVwhen I suddenly realized that all a light curve is,
p84
aVis a table of numbers converted into a visual plot.
p85
aVSo along with my collaborators,
p86
aVwe worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound.
p87
aVI achieved access to the data,
p88
aVand today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer,
p89
aVusing sound.
p90
aVAnd what people have been able to do,
p91
aVmainly visually,
p92
aVfor hundreds of years,
p93
aVnow I do it using sound.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aVListening to this gamma-ray burst
p97
aVthat you're seeing on the \u2014 (Applause continues)
p98
aa(lp99
VThank you.
p100
aa(lp101
VListening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen
p102
aVbrought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst.
p103
aVNow I'm going to play the burst for you.
p104
aVIt's not music, it's sound.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Digital beeping sounds)
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is scientific data converted into sound,
p109
aVand it's mapped in pitch.
p110
aVThe process is called sonification.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo listening to this brought something to the ear
p113
aVbesides the obvious burst.
p114
aVWhen I examine the very strong low-frequency regions,
p115
aVor bass line \u2014 I'm zooming into the bass line now.
p116
aVWe noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses
p117
aVlike the solar wind.
p118
aVAnd I want you to hear what I heard.
p119
aVYou will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume.
p120
aVAnd because you're sighted, I'm giving you a red line
p121
aVindicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Digital hum and whistling sound)
p124
aa(lp125
VThe (Whistles) is frogs at home, don't pay attention to that.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Digital hum and whistling sound)
p130
aa(lp131
VI think you heard it, right?
p132
aa(lp133
VSo what we found
p134
aVis that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances,
p135
aVwhich are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles
p136
aVthat may have been excited,
p137
aVthat depend on the volume.
p138
aVYou may remember that I said that the matter around the star
p139
aVis dragged around?
p140
aVIt transmits power with frequency and field distribution
p141
aVdetermined by the dimensions.
p142
aVYou may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star
p143
aVthat became a very strong magnetic field magnetar.
p144
aVIf this is the case, then outflows from the exploding star
p145
aVmay be associated with this gamma-ray burst.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat does that mean?
p148
aVThat star formation may be a very important part
p149
aVof these supernova explosions.
p150
aVListening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion
p151
aVthat the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display
p152
aVmay also support sighted astronomers
p153
aVin the search for more information in the data.
p154
aVSimultaneously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes,
p155
aVand my experiments demonstrated
p156
aVthat when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display,
p157
aVastronomers can find more information
p158
aVin this now more accessible data set.
p159
aVThis ability to transform data into sound
p160
aVgives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation.
p161
aVAnd the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved
p162
aVin order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens
p163
aVis a spirit-lifter.
p164
aa(lp165
VWhen I lost my sight,
p166
aVI noticed that I didn't have access
p167
aVto the same amount and quality of information
p168
aVa sighted astronomer had.
p169
aVIt was not until we innovated with the sonification process
p170
aVthat I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field
p171
aVthat I had worked so hard to be part of.
p172
aa(lp173
VYet, information access is not the only area in astronomy
p174
aVwhere this is important.
p175
aVThe situation is systemic
p176
aVand scientific fields are not keeping up.
p177
aVThe body is something changeable \u2014
p178
aVanyone may develop a disability at any point.
p179
aVLet's think about, for example,
p180
aVscientists that are already at the top of their careers.
p181
aVWhat happens to them if they develop a disability?
p182
aVWill they feel excommunicated as I did?
p183
aVInformation access empowers us to flourish.
p184
aVIt gives us equal opportunities to display our talents
p185
aVand choose what we want to do with our lives,
p186
aVbased on interest and not based on potential barriers.
p187
aVWhen we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits,
p188
aVthat will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life.
p189
aVAnd I think that the use of sound in astronomy
p190
aVis helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhile other countries told me that the study of perception techniques
p193
aVin order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy
p194
aVbecause there are no blind astronomers in the field,
p195
aVSouth Africa said, "We want people with disabilities
p196
aVto contribute to the field."
p197
aVRight now, I'm working
p198
aVat the South African Astronomical Observatory,
p199
aVat the Office of Astronomy for Development.
p200
aVThere, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods
p201
aVto impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind.
p202
aVThese students will be learning radio astronomy,
p203
aVand they will be learning the sonification methods
p204
aVin order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy
p205
aVfrom the sun, known as coronal mass ejections.
p206
aVWhat we learn with these students \u2014
p207
aVthese students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies
p208
aVthat will be accommodated \u2014
p209
aVwhat we learn with these students will directly impact
p210
aVthe way things are being done at the professional level.
p211
aVI humbly call this development.
p212
aVAnd this is happening right now.
p213
aa(lp214
VI think that science is for everyone.
p215
aVIt belongs to the people,
p216
aVand it has to be available to everyone,
p217
aVbecause we are all natural explorers.
p218
aVI think that if we limit people with disabilities
p219
aVfrom participating in science,
p220
aVwe'll sever our links with history and with society.
p221
aVI dream of a level scientific playing field,
p222
aVwhere people encourage respect and respect each other,
p223
aVwhere people exchange strategies and discover together.
p224
aVIf people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field,
p225
aVan explosion, a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place,
p226
aVI am sure.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Digital beeping sounds)
p229
aa(lp230
VThat is the titanic burst.
p231
