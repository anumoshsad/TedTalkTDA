VIn December of 2010,
p4
aVthe city of Apatzingán
p5
aVin the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,
p6
aVawoke to gunfire.
p7
aVFor two straight days,
p8
aVthe city became an open battlefield
p9
aVbetween the federal forces
p10
aVand a well-organized group,
p11
aVpresumably from the local criminal organization,
p12
aVLa Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
p13
aVThe citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire
p14
aVbut also explosions
p15
aVand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,
p16
aVso truly like a battlefield.
p17
aVAfter these two days,
p18
aVand during a particularly intense encounter,
p19
aVit was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,
p20
aVNazario Moreno, was killed.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn response to this terrifying violence,
p23
aVthe mayor of Apatzingán
p24
aVdecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
p25
aVThe idea was to ask for a softer approach
p26
aVto criminal activity in the state.
p27
aVAnd so, the day of the scheduled procession,
p28
aVthousands of people showed up.
p29
aVAs the mayor was preparing to deliver
p30
aVthe speech starting the march,
p31
aVhis team noticed
p32
aVthat, while half of the participants
p33
aVwere appropriately dressed in white,
p34
aVand bearing banners asking for peace,
p35
aVthe other half was actually marching
p36
aVin support of the criminal organization
p37
aVand its now-presumed-defunct leader.
p38
aVShocked, the mayor decided to step aside
p39
aVrather than participate or lead a procession
p40
aVthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
p41
aVAnd so his team stepped aside.
p42
aVThe two marches joined together,
p43
aVand they continued their path
p44
aVtowards the state capital.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis story of horrific violence
p47
aVfollowed by a fumbled approach
p48
aVby federal and local authorities as they tried
p49
aVto engage civil society,
p50
aVwho has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,
p51
aVis a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,
p52
aVwhere we see that our current understanding
p53
aVof drug violence and what leads to it
p54
aVis probably at the very least incomplete.
p55
aa(lp56
VIf you decided to spend 30 minutes trying
p57
aVto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico
p58
aVby, say, just researching online,
p59
aVthe first thing you would find out is that
p60
aVwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,
p61
aVthere are some that are more
p62
aVand there are some that are much less equal than others,
p63
aVbecause you will quickly find out
p64
aVthat in the past six years
p65
aVanywhere between 60 and 100,000 people
p66
aVhave lost their lives in drug-related violence.
p67
aVTo put these numbers in perspective,
p68
aVthis is eight times larger than the number of casualties
p69
aVin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
p70
aVIt's also shockingly close to the number of people
p71
aVwho have died in the Syrian civil war,
p72
aVwhich is an active civil war.
p73
aVThis is happening just south of the border.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow as you're reading, however,
p76
aVyou will be maybe surprised that you will quickly
p77
aVbecome numb to the numbers of deaths,
p78
aVbecause you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers
p79
aVof faceless, nameless dead people.
p80
aVImplicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative
p81
aVthat all the people who are dying
p82
aVwere somehow involved in the drug trade,
p83
aVand we infer this because they were either tortured
p84
aVor executed in a professional manner,
p85
aVor, most likely, both.
p86
aVAnd so clearly they were criminals
p87
aVbecause of the way they died.
p88
aVAnd so the narrative is that somehow these people
p89
aVgot what they were deserved.
p90
aVThey were part of the bad guys.
p91
aVAnd that creates some form of comfort
p92
aVfor a lot of people.
p93
aa(lp94
VHowever, while it's easier to think
p95
aVof us, the citizens, the police, the army,
p96
aVas the good guys, and them, the narcos,
p97
aVthe carteles, as the bad guys,
p98
aVif you think about it,
p99
aVthe latter are only providing a service to the former.
p100
aVWhether we like it or not,
p101
aVthe U.S. is the largest market
p102
aVfor illegal substances in the world,
p103
aVaccounting for more than half of global demand.
p104
aVIt shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico
p105
aVthat is its only route of access from the South,
p106
aVand so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,
p107
aVused to say, "Poor Mexico,
p108
aVso far from God and so close to the United States."
p109
aa(lp110
VThe U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users
p111
aVof illegal drugs in the United States.
p112
aVUsing very, very conservative assumptions,
p113
aVthis yields a yearly drug market on the retail side
p114
aVof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
p115
aVIf we assume that the narcos only have access
p116
aVto the wholesale part, which we know is false,
p117
aVthat still leaves you with yearly revenues
p118
aVof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
p119
aVTo put these numbers in perspective,
p120
aVMicrosoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
p121
aVAnd it so happens that this is a product that,
p122
aVbecause of its nature, a business model
p123
aVto address this market requires you
p124
aVto guarantee to your producers
p125
aVthat their product will be reliably placed
p126
aVin the markets where it is consumed.
p127
aVAnd the only way to do this, because it's illegal,
p128
aVis to have absolute control of the geographic corridors
p129
aVthat are used to transport drugs.
p130
aVHence the violence.
p131
aVIf you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,
p132
aVyou will see that it almost perfectly aligns
p133
aVwith the most efficient routes of transportation
p134
aVfrom the south to the north.
p135
aVThe only thing that the cartels are doing
p136
aVis that they're trying to protect their business.
p137
aa(lp138
VIt's not only a multi-billion dollar market,
p139
aVbut it's also a complex one.
p140
aVFor example, the coca plant is a fragile plant
p141
aVthat can only grow in certain latitudes,
p142
aVand so it means that a business model
p143
aVto address this market requires you to have
p144
aVdecentralized, international production,
p145
aVthat by the way needs to have good quality control,
p146
aVbecause people need a good high
p147
aVthat is not going to kill them
p148
aVand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
p149
aVAnd so that means they need to secure
p150
aVproduction and quality control in the south,
p151
aVand you need to ensure that you have
p152
aVefficient and effective distribution channels
p153
aVin the markets where these drugs are consumed.
p154
aVI urge you, but only a little bit,
p155
aVbecause I don't want to get you in trouble,
p156
aVto just ask around and see how difficult it would be
p157
aVto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,
p158
aVwhenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,
p159
aVand some of you may be surprised to know
p160
aVthat there are many dealers that offer a service
p161
aVwhere if you send them a text message,
p162
aVthey guarantee delivery of the drug
p163
aVin 30 minutes or less.
p164
aa(lp165
VThink about this for a second.
p166
aVThink about the complexity
p167
aVof the distribution network that I just described.
p168
aVIt's very difficult to reconcile this
p169
aVwith the image of faceless, ignorant goons
p170
aVthat are just shooting each other,
p171
aVvery difficult to reconcile.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,
p174
aVan effective organization requires
p175
aVan integrated strategy that includes
p176
aVa good organizational structure, good incentives,
p177
aVa solid identity and good brand management.
p178
aVThis leads me to the second thing that you would learn
p179
aVin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
p180
aVBecause you would quickly realize,
p181
aVand maybe be confused by the fact,
p182
aVthat there are three organizations
p183
aVthat are constantly named in the articles.
p184
aVYou will hear about Los Zetas,
p185
aVthe Knights Templar, which is the new brand
p186
aVfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,
p187
aVand the Sinaloa Federation.
p188
aVYou will read that Los Zetas is this assortment
p189
aVof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter
p190
aVand they silence the press,
p191
aVand this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
p192
aVBut this is the result of a very careful branding
p193
aVand business strategy.
p194
aVYou see, Los Zetas is not just
p195
aVthis random assortment of individuals,
p196
aVbut was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,
p197
aVthat used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
p198
aVWhen that corridor became contested, they decided
p199
aVthat they wanted to recruit
p200
aVa professional enforcement arm.
p201
aVSo they recruited Los Zetas:
p202
aVan entire unit of elite paratroopers
p203
aVfrom the Mexican Army.
p204
aVThey were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,
p205
aVso much so that at some point, they decided
p206
aVto just take over the operations,
p207
aVwhich is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,
p208
aVbecause they grow up.
p209
aVBecause the Zetas organization was founded in treason,
p210
aVthey lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution
p211
aVin the most profitable markets like cocaine,
p212
aVbut what they did have,
p213
aVand this is again based on their military origin,
p214
aVwas a perfectly structured chain of command
p215
aVwith a very clear hierarchy
p216
aVand a very clear promotion path that allowed them
p217
aVto supervise and operate across many, many markets
p218
aVvery effectively,
p219
aVwhich is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
p220
aVAnd so because they didn't have access
p221
aVto the more profitable drug markets,
p222
aVthis pushed them and gave them the opportunity
p223
aVto diversify into other forms of crime.
p224
aVThat includes kidnapping, prostitution,
p225
aVlocal drug dealing and human trafficking,
p226
aVincluding of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
p227
aVSo what they currently run is truly
p228
aVand quite literally a franchise business.
p229
aVThey focus most of their recruiting on the army,
p230
aVand they very openly advertise for better salaries,
p231
aVbetter benefits, better promotion paths,
p232
aVnot to mention much better food,
p233
aVthan what the army can deliver.
p234
aVThe way they operate is that
p235
aVwhen they arrive in a locality,
p236
aVthey let people know that they are there,
p237
aVand they go to the most powerful local gang
p238
aVand they say, "I offer you
p239
aVto be the local representative of the Zeta brand."
p240
aVIf they agree \u2014 and you don't want to know
p241
aVwhat happens if they don't \u2014
p242
aVthey train them and they supervise them
p243
aVon how to run the most efficient criminal operation
p244
aVfor that town, in exchange for royalties.
p245
aVThis kind of business model obviously depends
p246
aVentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,
p247
aVand so Los Zetas
p248
aVcarefully stage acts of violence
p249
aVthat are spectacular in nature,
p250
aVespecially when they arrive first in a city,
p251
aVbut again, that's just a brand strategy.
p252
aVI'm not saying they're not violent,
p253
aVbut what I am saying is that even though you will read
p254
aVthat they are the most violent of all,
p255
aVwhen you count, when you do the body count,
p256
aVthey're actually all the same.
p257
aa(lp258
VIn contrast to them, the Knights Templar
p259
aVthat arose in Michoacán
p260
aVemerged in reaction to the incursion
p261
aVof the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
p262
aVMichoacán is a geographically strategic state
p263
aVbecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,
p264
aVand it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,
p265
aVwhich then gives you direct access to the U.S.
p266
aVThe Knights Templar realized very quickly
p267
aVthat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,
p268
aVand so they developed a strategy
p269
aVas a social enterprise.
p270
aVThey brand themselves as representative of
p271
aVand protecting of the citizens of Michoacán
p272
aVagainst organized crime.
p273
aVTheir brand of social enterprise means
p274
aVthat they require a lot of civic engagement,
p275
aVso they invest heavily in providing local services,
p276
aVlike dealing with home violence,
p277
aVgoing after petty criminals, treating addicts,
p278
aVand keeping drugs out of the local markets
p279
aVwhere they are,
p280
aVand, of course, protecting people
p281
aVfrom other criminal organizations.
p282
aVNow, they kill a lot of people too,
p283
aVbut when they kill them,
p284
aVthey provide very careful narratives and descriptions
p285
aVfor why they did them,
p286
aVthrough newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,
p287
aVand billboards that explain that the people who were killed
p288
aVwere killed because they represented a threat
p289
aVnot to us, as an organization, of course,
p290
aVbut to you, as citizens.
p291
aVAnd so we're actually here to protect you.
p292
aVThey, as social enterprises do,
p293
aVhave created a moral and ethical code
p294
aVthat they advertise around,
p295
aVand they have very strict recruiting practices.
p296
aVAnd here you have the types of explanations
p297
aVthat they provide for some of their actions.
p298
aVThey have actually retained access
p299
aVto the profitable drug trade,
p300
aVbut the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,
p301
aVand they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,
p302
aVthey leverage that to, for example,
p303
aVtrade copper from Michoacán that is legally created
p304
aVand legally extracted
p305
aVwith illegal ephedrine from China
p306
aVwhich is a critical precursor for methamphetamines
p307
aVthat they produce, and then they have partnerships
p308
aVwith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation
p309
aVthat place their products in the U.S.
p310
aa(lp311
VFinally, the Sinaloa Federation.
p312
aVWhen you read about them, you will often read about them
p313
aVwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,
p314
aVbecause they are the most integrated
p315
aVand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,
p316
aVand, many people argue, the world.
p317
aVThey started as just sort of a transport organization
p318
aVthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
p319
aVand the Mexican borders,
p320
aVbut now they have grown
p321
aVinto a truly integrated multinational
p322
aVthat has partnerships in production in the south
p323
aVand partnerships in global distribution
p324
aVacross the planet.
p325
aVThey have cultivated a brand of professionalism,
p326
aVbusiness acumen and innovation.
p327
aVThey have designed new drug products
p328
aVand new drug processes.
p329
aVThey have designed narco-tunnels
p330
aVthat go across the border,
p331
aVand you can see that these are not
p332
aV"The Shawshank Redemption" types.
p333
aVThey have invented narco-submarines and boats
p334
aVthat are not detected by radar.
p335
aVThey have invented drones to transport drugs,
p336
aVcatapults, you name it.
p337
aVOne of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation
p338
aVactually made it to the Forbes list.
p339
aa(lp340
V[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]
p341
aa(lp342
VLike any multinational would, they have specialized
p343
aVand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,
p344
aVwhich is high-margin drugs like cocaine,
p345
aVheroine, methamphetamines.
p346
aVLike any traditional Latin American multinational would,
p347
aVthe way they control their operations
p348
aVis through family ties.
p349
aVWhen they're entering a new market, they send
p350
aVa family member to supervise it,
p351
aVor, if they're partnering with a new organization,
p352
aVthey create a family tie,
p353
aVeither through marriages or other types of ties.
p354
aVLike any other multinational would,
p355
aVthey protect their brand by outsourcing
p356
aVthe more questionable parts of the business model,
p357
aVlike for example, when they have to engage
p358
aVin violence against other criminal organizations,
p359
aVthey recruit gangs and other smaller players
p360
aVto do the dirty work for them,
p361
aVand they try to separate their operations
p362
aVand their violence and be very discrete about this.
p363
aa(lp364
VTo further strengthen their brand,
p365
aVthey actually have professional P.R. firms
p366
aVthat shape how the press talks about them.
p367
aVThey have professional videographers on staff.
p368
aVThey have incredibly productive ties
p369
aVwith the security organizations
p370
aVon both sides of the border.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd so, differences aside,
p373
aVwhat these three organizations share
p374
aVis on the one hand, a very clear understanding
p375
aVthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,
p376
aVbut rather they are built from the bottom up
p377
aVone interaction at a time.
p378
aVThey have created extremely coherent structures
p379
aVthat they use to show the inconsistencies
p380
aVin government policies.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd so what I want you to remember from this talk
p383
aVare three things.
p384
aVThe first one is that drug violence
p385
aVis actually the result
p386
aVof a huge market demand
p387
aVand an institutional setup that forces
p388
aVthe servicing of this market to necessitate violence
p389
aVto guarantee delivery routes.
p390
aVThe second thing I want you to remember
p391
aVis that these are sophisticated,
p392
aVcoherent organizations
p393
aVthat are business organizations,
p394
aVand analyzing them and treating them as such
p395
aVis probably a much more useful approach.
p396
aVThe third thing I want you to remember
p397
aVis that even though we're more comfortable
p398
aVwith this idea of "them,"
p399
aVa set of bad guys separated from us,
p400
aVwe are actually accomplices to them,
p401
aVeither through our direct consumption
p402
aVor through our acceptance of the inconsistency
p403
aVbetween our policies of prohibition
p404
aVand our actual behavior of tolerance
p405
aVor even encouragement of consumption.
p406
aa(lp407
VThese organizations service, recruit from,
p408
aVand operate within our communities,
p409
aVso necessarily, they are much more integrated
p410
aVwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
p411
aVAnd so to me the question is not whether
p412
aVthese dynamics will continue the way they have.
p413
aVWe see that the nature of this phenomenon
p414
aVguarantees that they will.
p415
aVThe question is whether we are willing to continue
p416
aVour support of a failed strategy
p417
aVbased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance
p418
aVat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
p419
