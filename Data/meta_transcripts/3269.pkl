V"Can you taste words?"
p4
aa(lp5
VIt was a question that caught me by surprise.
p6
aVThis summer, I was giving a talk at a literary festival,
p7
aVand afterwards, as I was signing books,
p8
aVa teenage girl came with her friend,
p9
aVand this is what she asked me.
p10
aVI told her that some people experience an overlap in their senses
p11
aVso that they could hear colors
p12
aVor see sounds,
p13
aVand many writers were fascinated by this subject, myself included.
p14
aVBut she cut me off, a bit impatiently, and said, "Yeah, I know all of that.
p15
aVIt's called synesthesia. We learned it at school.
p16
aVBut my mom is reading your book,
p17
aVand she says there's lots of food and ingredients
p18
aVand a long dinner scene in it.
p19
aVShe gets hungry at every page.
p20
aVSo I was thinking,
p21
aVhow come you don't get hungry when you write?
p22
aVAnd I thought maybe, maybe you could taste words.
p23
aVDoes it make sense?"
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd, actually, it did make sense,
p26
aVbecause ever since my childhood,
p27
aVeach letter in the alphabet has a different color,
p28
aVand colors bring me flavors.
p29
aVSo for instance, the color purple is quite pungent, almost perfumed,
p30
aVand any words that I associate with purple
p31
aVtaste the same way,
p32
aVsuch as "sunset" \u2014 a very spicy word.
p33
aVBut I was worried that if I tell all of this to the teenager,
p34
aVit might sound either too abstract
p35
aVor perhaps too weird,
p36
aVand there wasn't enough time anyhow,
p37
aVbecause people were waiting in the queue,
p38
aVso it suddenly felt like what I was trying to convey
p39
aVwas more complicated and detailed
p40
aVthan what the circumstances allowed me to say.
p41
aVAnd I did what I usually do in similar situations:
p42
aVI stammered, I shut down, and I stopped talking.
p43
aVI stopped talking because the truth was complicated,
p44
aVeven though I knew, deep within,
p45
aVthat one should never, ever remain silent for fear of complexity.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo I want to start my talk today
p48
aVwith the answer that I was not able to give on that day.
p49
aVYes, I can taste words \u2014
p50
aVsometimes, that is, not always,
p51
aVand happy words have a different flavor than sad words.
p52
aVI like to explore: What does the word "creativity" taste like,
p53
aVor "equality,"
p54
aV"love," "revolution?"
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd what about "motherland?"
p57
aVThese days, it's particularly this last word that troubles me.
p58
aVIt leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,
p59
aVlike cinnamon, a bit of rose water
p60
aVand golden apples.
p61
aVBut underneath, there's a sharp tang,
p62
aVlike nettles and dandelion.
p63
aVThe taste of my motherland, Turkey,
p64
aVis a mixture of sweet and bitter.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd the reason why I'm telling you this
p67
aVis because I think there's more and more people
p68
aVall around the world today
p69
aVwho have similarly mixed emotions
p70
aVabout the lands they come from.
p71
aVWe love our native countries, yeah?
p72
aVHow can we not?
p73
aVWe feel attached to the people, the culture, the land, the food.
p74
aVAnd yet at the same time,
p75
aVwe feel increasingly frustrated by its politics and politicians,
p76
aVsometimes to the point of despair or hurt or anger.
p77
aa(lp78
VI want to talk about emotions
p79
aVand the need to boost our emotional intelligence.
p80
aVI think it's a pity
p81
aVthat mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.
p82
aVOftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics
p83
aVthat they seem to forget those things in life
p84
aVthat are difficult to measure
p85
aVand perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models.
p86
aVBut I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons.
p87
aVFirstly, because we are emotional beings.
p88
aVAs human beings, I think we all are like that.
p89
aVBut secondly, and this is new,
p90
aVwe have entered a new stage in world history
p91
aVin which collective sentiments guide and misguide politics
p92
aVmore than ever before.
p93
aVAnd through social media and social networking,
p94
aVthese sentiments are further amplified,
p95
aVpolarized, and they travel around the world quite fast.
p96
aVOurs is the age of anxiety, anger,
p97
aVdistrust, resentment
p98
aVand, I think, lots of fear.
p99
aVBut here's the thing:
p100
aVeven though there's plenty of research about economic factors,
p101
aVthere's relatively few studies about emotional factors.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhy is it that we underestimate feelings and perceptions?
p104
aVI think it's going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges,
p105
aVbecause our political systems are replete with emotions.
p106
aVIn country after country,
p107
aVwe have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions.
p108
aVAnd yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia,
p109
aVwe are yet to take emotions seriously.
p110
aVI think we should.
p111
aVAnd just like we should focus on economic inequality worldwide,
p112
aVwe need to pay more attention to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide
p113
aVand how to bridge these gaps,
p114
aVbecause they do matter.
p115
aa(lp116
VYears ago, when I was still living in Istanbul,
p117
aVan American scholar working on women writers in the Middle East
p118
aVcame to see me.
p119
aVAnd at some point in our exchange, she said,
p120
aV"I understand why you're a feminist,
p121
aVbecause, you know, you live in Turkey."
p122
aVAnd I said to her,
p123
aV"I don't understand why you're not a feminist,
p124
aVbecause, you know, you live in America."
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aVAnd she laughed.
p130
aVShe took it as a joke,
p131
aVand the moment passed.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VBut the way she had divided the world into two imaginary camps,
p136
aVinto two opposite camps \u2014
p137
aVit bothered me and it stayed with me.
p138
aVAccording to this imaginary map,
p139
aVsome parts of the world were liquid countries.
p140
aVThey were like choppy waters not yet settled.
p141
aVSome other parts of the world, namely the West,
p142
aVwere solid, safe and stable.
p143
aVSo it was the liquid lands that needed feminism
p144
aVand activism and human rights,
p145
aVand those of us who were unfortunate enough
p146
aVto come from such places
p147
aVhad to keep struggling for these most essential values.
p148
aVBut there was hope.
p149
aVSince history moved forward,
p150
aVeven the most unsteady lands would someday catch up.
p151
aVAnd meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands
p152
aVcould take comfort in the progress of history
p153
aVand in the triumph of the liberal order.
p154
aVThey could support the struggles of other people elsewhere,
p155
aVbut they themselves did not have to struggle
p156
aVfor the basics of democracy anymore,
p157
aVbecause they were beyond that stage.
p158
aa(lp159
VI think in the year 2016,
p160
aVthis hierarchical geography was shattered to pieces.
p161
aVOur world no longer follows this dualistic pattern
p162
aVin the scholar's mind, if it ever did.
p163
aVNow we know that history does not necessarily move forward.
p164
aVSometimes it draws circles,
p165
aVeven slides backwards,
p166
aVand that generations can make the same mistakes
p167
aVthat their great-grandfathers had made.
p168
aVAnd now we know that there's no such thing
p169
aVas solid countries versus liquid countries.
p170
aVIn fact, we are all living in liquid times,
p171
aVjust like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.
p172
aVAnd Bauman had another definition for our age.
p173
aVHe used to say we are all going to be walking on moving sands.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd if that's the case, I think,
p176
aVit should concern us women more than men,
p177
aVbecause when societies slide backwards into authoritarianism,
p178
aVnationalism or religious fanaticism,
p179
aVwomen have much more to lose.
p180
aVThat is why this needs to be a vital moment,
p181
aVnot only for global activism,
p182
aVbut in my opinion, for global sisterhood as well.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VBut I want to make a little confession before I go any further.
p187
aVUntil recently, whenever I took part in an international conference or festival,
p188
aVI would be usually one of the more depressed speakers.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VHaving seen how our dreams of democracy and how our dreams of coexistence
p193
aVwere crushed in Turkey,
p194
aVboth gradually but also with a bewildering speed,
p195
aVover the years I've felt quite demoralized.
p196
aVAnd at these festivals there would be some other gloomy writers,
p197
aVand they would come from places such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan,
p198
aVBangladesh, Philippines, China, Venezuela, Russia.
p199
aVAnd we would smile at each other in sympathy,
p200
aVthis camaraderie of the doomed.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd you could call us WADWIC:
p205
aVWorried and Depressed Writers International Club.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VBut then things began to change,
p210
aVand suddenly our club became more popular,
p211
aVand we started to have new members.
p212
aVI remember \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VI remember Greek writers and poets joined first, came on board.
p217
aVAnd then writers from Hungary and Poland,
p218
aVand then, interestingly, writers from Austria, the Netherlands, France,
p219
aVand then writers from the UK, where I live and where I call my home,
p220
aVand then writers from the USA.
p221
aVSuddenly, there were more of us
p222
aVfeeling worried about the fate of our nations
p223
aVand the future of the world.
p224
aVAnd maybe there were more of us now
p225
aVfeeling like strangers in our own motherlands.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd then this bizarre thing happened.
p228
aVThose of us who used to be very depressed for a long time,
p229
aVwe started to feel less depressed,
p230
aVwhereas the newcomers, they were so not used to feeling this way
p231
aVthat they were now even more depressed.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo you could see writers from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt
p236
aVtrying to console their colleagues
p237
aVfrom Brexit Britain or from post-election USA.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VBut joking aside,
p242
aVI think our world is full of unprecedented challenges,
p243
aVand this comes with an emotional backlash,
p244
aVbecause in the face of high-speed change,
p245
aVmany people wish to slow down,
p246
aVand when there's too much unfamiliarity,
p247
aVpeople long for the familiar.
p248
aVAnd when things get too confusing,
p249
aVmany people crave simplicity.
p250
aVThis is a very dangerous crossroads,
p251
aVbecause it's exactly where the demagogue enters into the picture.
p252
aa(lp253
VThe demagogue understands how collective sentiments work
p254
aVand how he \u2014 it's usually a he \u2014 can benefit from them.
p255
aVHe tells us that we all belong in our tribes,
p256
aVand he tells us that we will be safer if we are surrounded by sameness.
p257
aVDemagogues come in all sizes and in all shapes.
p258
aVThis could be the eccentric leader of a marginal political party
p259
aVsomewhere in Europe,
p260
aVor an Islamist extremist imam preaching dogma and hatred,
p261
aVor it could be a white supremacist Nazi-admiring orator somewhere else.
p262
aVAll these figures, at first glance \u2014 they seem disconnected.
p263
aVBut I think they feed each other,
p264
aVand they need each other.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd all around the world,
p267
aVwhen we look at how demagogues talk and how they inspire movements,
p268
aVI think they have one unmistakable quality in common:
p269
aVthey strongly, strongly dislike plurality.
p270
aVThey cannot deal with multiplicity.
p271
aVAdorno used to say,
p272
aV"Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign of an authoritarian personality."
p273
aVBut I ask myself:
p274
aVWhat if that same sign,
p275
aVthat same intolerance of ambiguity \u2014
p276
aVwhat if it's the mark of our times, of the age we're living in?
p277
aVBecause wherever I look, I see nuances withering away.
p278
aVOn TV shows, we have one anti-something speaker
p279
aVsituated against a pro-something speaker.
p280
aVYeah? It's good ratings.
p281
aVIt's even better if they shout at each other.
p282
aVEven in academia, where our intellect is supposed to be nourished,
p283
aVyou see one atheist scholar competing with a firmly theist scholar,
p284
aVbut it's not a real intellectual exchange,
p285
aVbecause it's a clash between two certainties.
p286
aa(lp287
VI think binary oppositions are everywhere.
p288
aVSo slowly and systematically,
p289
aVwe are being denied the right to be complex.
p290
aVIstanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels,
p291
aVDhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona:
p292
aVwe have seen one horrible terror attack after another.
p293
aVAnd when you express your sorrow, and when you react against the cruelty,
p294
aVyou get all kinds of reactions,
p295
aVmessages on social media.
p296
aVBut one of them is quite disturbing,
p297
aVonly because it's so widespread.
p298
aVThey say, "Why do you feel sorry for them?
p299
aVWhy do you feel sorry for them?
p300
aVWhy don't you feel sorry for civilians in Yemen
p301
aVor civilians in Syria?"
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd I think the people who write such messages
p304
aVdo not understand
p305
aVthat we can feel sorry for and stand in solidarity with
p306
aVvictims of terrorism and violence in the Middle East, in Europe,
p307
aVin Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere,
p308
aVequally and simultaneously.
p309
aVThey don't seem to understand that we don't have to pick one pain
p310
aVand one place over all others.
p311
aVBut I think this is what tribalism does to us.
p312
aVIt shrinks our minds, for sure,
p313
aVbut it also shrinks our hearts,
p314
aVto such an extent that we become numb to the suffering of other people.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd the sad truth is, we weren't always like this.
p317
aVI had a children's book out in Turkey,
p318
aVand when the book was published, I did lots of events.
p319
aVI went to many primary schools,
p320
aVwhich gave me a chance to observe younger kids in Turkey.
p321
aVAnd it was always amazing to see how much empathy, imagination
p322
aVand chutzpah they have.
p323
aVThese children are much more inclined to become global citizens
p324
aVthan nationalists at that age.
p325
aVAnd it's wonderful to see, when you ask them,
p326
aVso many of them want to be poets and writers,
p327
aVand girls are just as confident as boys,
p328
aVif not even more.
p329
aa(lp330
VBut then I would go to high schools,
p331
aVand everything has changed.
p332
aVNow nobody wants to be a writer anymore,
p333
aVnow nobody wants to be a novelist anymore,
p334
aVand girls have become timid,
p335
aVthey are cautious, guarded,
p336
aVreluctant to speak up in the public space,
p337
aVbecause we have taught them \u2014
p338
aVthe family, the school, the society \u2014
p339
aVwe have taught them to erase their individuality.
p340
aa(lp341
VI think East and West,
p342
aVwe are losing multiplicity,
p343
aVboth within our societies and within ourselves.
p344
aVAnd coming from Turkey, I do know that the loss of diversity
p345
aVis a major, major loss.
p346
aVToday, my motherland became the world's biggest jailer
p347
aVfor journalists,
p348
aVsurpassing even China's sad record.
p349
aVAnd I also believe that what happened over there in Turkey
p350
aVcan happen anywhere.
p351
aVIt can even happen here.
p352
aVSo just like solid countries was an illusion,
p353
aVsingular identities is also an illusion,
p354
aVbecause we all have a multiplicity of voices inside.
p355
aVThe Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz,
p356
aVused to say, "You carry in your soul every ingredient necessary
p357
aVto turn your existence into joy.
p358
aVAll you have to do is to mix those ingredients."
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd I think mix we can.
p361
aVI am an Istanbulite,
p362
aVbut I'm also attached to the Balkans,
p363
aVthe Aegean, the Mediterranean,
p364
aVthe Middle East, the Levant.
p365
aVI am a European by birth, by choice,
p366
aVthe values that I uphold.
p367
aVI have become a Londoner over the years.
p368
aVI would like to think of myself as a global soul, as a world citizen,
p369
aVa nomad and an itinerant storyteller.
p370
aVI have multiple attachments, just like all of us do.
p371
aVAnd multiple attachments mean multiple stories.
p372
aa(lp373
VAs writers, we always chase stories, of course,
p374
aVbut I think we are also interested in silences,
p375
aVthe things we cannot talk about,
p376
aVpolitical taboos, cultural taboos.
p377
aVWe're also interested in our own silences.
p378
aVI have always been very vocal about and written extensively
p379
aVabout minority rights, women's rights,
p380
aVLGBT rights.
p381
aVBut as I was thinking about this TED Talk,
p382
aVI realized one thing:
p383
aVI have never had the courage to say in a public space
p384
aVthat I was bisexual myself,
p385
aVbecause I so feared the slander
p386
aVand the stigma and the ridicule
p387
aVand the hatred that was sure to follow.
p388
aVBut of course, one should never, ever, remain silent
p389
aVfor fear of complexity.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Applause)
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd although I am no stranger to anxieties,
p394
aVand although I am talking here about the power of emotions \u2014
p395
aVI do know the power of emotions \u2014
p396
aVI have discovered over time
p397
aVthat emotions are not limitless.
p398
aVYou know? They have a limit.
p399
aVThere comes a moment \u2014
p400
aVit's like a tipping point or a threshold \u2014
p401
aVwhen you get tired of feeling afraid,
p402
aVwhen you get tired of feeling anxious.
p403
aVAnd I think not only individuals,
p404
aVbut perhaps nations, too, have their own tipping points.
p405
aVSo even stronger than my emotions
p406
aVis my awareness
p407
aVthat not only gender, not only identity,
p408
aVbut life itself is fluid.
p409
aVThey want to divide us into tribes,
p410
aVbut we are connected across borders.
p411
aVThey preach certainty,
p412
aVbut we know that life has plenty of magic
p413
aVand plenty of ambiguity.
p414
aVAnd they like to incite dualities,
p415
aVbut we are far more nuanced than that.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo what can we do?
p418
aVI think we need to go back to the basics,
p419
aVback to the colors of the alphabet.
p420
aVThe Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran used to say,
p421
aV"I learned silence from the talkative
p422
aVand tolerance from the intolerant
p423
aVand kindness from the unkind."
p424
aVI think it's a great motto for our times.
p425
aa(lp426
VSo from populist demagogues, we will learn
p427
aVthe indispensability of democracy.
p428
aVAnd from isolationists, we will learn the need for global solidarity.
p429
aVAnd from tribalists, we will learn the beauty of cosmopolitanism
p430
aVand the beauty of diversity.
p431
aa(lp432
VAs I finish, I want to leave you with one word, or one taste.
p433
aVThe word "yurt" in Turkish means "motherland."
p434
aVIt means "homeland."
p435
aVBut interestingly, the word also means
p436
aV"a tent used by nomadic tribes."
p437
aVAnd I like that combination, because it makes me think
p438
aVhomelands do not need to be rooted in one place.
p439
aVThey can be portable.
p440
aVWe can take them with us everywhere.
p441
aVAnd I think for writers, for storytellers,
p442
aVat the end of the day,
p443
aVthere is one main homeland,
p444
aVand it's called "Storyland."
p445
aVAnd the taste of that word
p446
aVis the taste of freedom.
p447
aa(lp448
VThank you.
