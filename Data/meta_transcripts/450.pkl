VRight when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy.
p4
aVMy family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California,
p5
aVfrom the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines.
p6
aVThere was gas rationing in 1973.
p7
aVThe energy crisis was in full bore.
p8
aa(lp9
VI started reading "Popular Science" magazine,
p10
aVand I got really excited about the potential of solar energy
p11
aVto try and solve that crisis.
p12
aVI had just taken trigonometry in high school,
p13
aVI learned about the parabola
p14
aVand how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.
p15
aVThat got me very excited.
p16
aVAnd I really felt that there would be potential
p17
aVto build some kind of thing that could concentrate light.
p18
aVSo, I started this company called Solar Devices.
p19
aVAnd this was a company where I built parabolas,
p20
aVI took metal shop,
p21
aVand I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines.
p22
aVAnd I was building a Stirling engine over on the lathe,
p23
aVand all the motorcycle guys said, "You're building a bong, aren't you?"
p24
aVAnd I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine." But they didn't believe me.
p25
aa(lp26
VI sold the plans for this engine
p27
aVand for this dish in the back of "Popular Science" magazine,
p28
aVfor four dollars each.
p29
aVAnd I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech.
p30
aVIt was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech.
p31
aVAnd at my first year at Caltech, I continued the business.
p32
aVBut then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading.
p33
aVThe whole first year was pass/fail, but the second year was graded.
p34
aVI wasn't able to keep up with the business,
p35
aVand I ended up with a 25-year detour.
p36
aVMy dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost,
p37
aVbut then I had this big detour.
p38
aVFirst, the coursework at Caltech.
p39
aVThen, when I graduated from Caltech, the IBM PC came out,
p40
aVand I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,
p43
aVand I was completely blown away by Lotus 1-2-3.
p44
aVI began operating my business with 1-2-3, began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,
p45
aVwrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3.
p46
aVI started an educational software company after I joined Lotus,
p47
aVand then I started Idealab so I could have a roof
p48
aVunder which I could build multiple companies in succession.
p49
aa(lp50
VMuch later \u2014 in 2000, very recently \u2014 the new California energy crisis \u2014
p51
aVwhat was purported to be a big energy crisis \u2014 was coming.
p52
aVAnd I was trying to figure out
p53
aVif we could build something that would capitalize on that
p54
aVand get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came.
p55
aVAnd I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems
p56
aVthat could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day,
p57
aVor three days' worth of backup power.
p58
aVI'm glad you heard earlier today, batteries are unbelievably \u2014
p59
aVlack density compared to fuel.
p60
aVSo much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.
p61
aVYou'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space
p62
aVjust to give yourself four hours of battery backup.
p63
aVAnd I concluded, after researching every other technology
p64
aVthat we could deploy for storing energy \u2014
p65
aVflywheels, different formulations of batteries \u2014
p66
aVit just wasn't practical to store energy.
p67
aVSo what about making energy? Maybe we could make energy.
p68
aa(lp69
VI tried to figure out \u2014 maybe solar's become attractive.
p70
aVIt's been 25 years since I was doing this,
p71
aVlet me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells.
p72
aVAnd the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt
p73
aVto about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized.
p74
aVAnd it needed to get much lower to be cost-effective.
p75
aVI studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells,
p76
aVand was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively.
p77
aVA lot of new things are happening to do that,
p78
aVbut fundamentally, the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
p79
aVSome people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell
p80
aVthan it will give out in its entire life.
p81
aVIf we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells,
p82
aVthat will become more practical.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut right now, you pretty much have to take silicon,
p85
aVput it in an oven at 1600 F for 17 hours, to make the cells.
p86
aVA lot of people are working to try and reduce that,
p87
aVbut I didn't have anything to contribute.
p88
aVSo I tried to figure out what other way could we try
p89
aVto make cost-effective solar electricity.
p90
aVWhat if we collect the sun with a large reflector \u2014
p91
aVlike I had been thinking about in high school,
p92
aVbut maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper \u2014
p93
aVconcentrate it to a small converter,
p94
aVand then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive,
p95
aVbecause it's much smaller, rather than solar cells,
p96
aVwhich have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis seemed practical now,
p99
aVbecause a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years
p100
aVsince I had last looked at it.
p101
aVThere was a lot of new manufacturing techniques,
p102
aVnot to mention really cheap miniature motors \u2014
p103
aVbrushless motors, servomotors, stepper motors,
p104
aVthat are used in printers and scanners.
p105
aVSo, that's a breakthrough.
p106
aVOf course, inexpensive microprocessors
p107
aVand a very important breakthrough \u2014 genetic algorithms.
p108
aa(lp109
VI'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
p110
aVIt's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection.
p111
aVYou take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer,
p112
aVyou build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing,
p113
aVyou add sex \u2014
p114
aVwhere you take half of one solution and half of another
p115
aVand then make new mutations \u2014
p116
aVand you use natural selection to kill off not-as-good solutions.
p117
aa(lp118
VUsually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today,
p119
aVwith a three gigahertz processor,
p120
aVyou can solve many formerly intractable problems
p121
aVin just a matter of minutes.
p122
aVSo we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms
p123
aVto create a new type of concentrator.
p124
aVAnd I'll show you what we came up with.
p125
aa(lp126
VTraditionally, concentrators look like this.
p127
aVThose shapes are parabolas.
p128
aVThey take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.
p129
aVThey have to track the sun,
p130
aVbecause they have to point directly at the sun.
p131
aVThey usually have a one degree acceptance angle \u2014
p132
aVonce they're more than a degree off,
p133
aVnone of the sunlight rays will hit the focus.
p134
aVSo we tried to come up with a non-tracking collector
p135
aVthat would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts.
p136
aVSo we created a genetic algorithm to try this out,
p137
aVwe made a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector,
p138
aVand an amazing thing evolved, literally,
p139
aVfrom trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts,
p140
aVwith a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light,
p141
aVfrom the most angles, over a day, from the sun.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd this is the shape that evolved.
p144
aVIt's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns,
p145
aVand each of them collect light in the following way \u2014
p146
aVif the sunlight strikes right here,
p147
aVit might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly,
p148
aVbut if the sun is off axis and comes from the side,
p149
aVit might hit two places and take two bounces.
p150
aVSo for direct light, it takes only one bounce,
p151
aVfor off-axis light it might take two,
p152
aVand for extreme off-axis, it might take three.
p153
aVYour efficiency goes down with more bounces,
p154
aVbecause you lose about 10 percent with each bounce,
p155
aVbut this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.
p156
aVSo, about two and a half hours of the day
p157
aVwe could collect with a stationary component.
p158
aa(lp159
VSolar cells collect light for four and a half hours though.
p160
aVOn an average adjusted day, a solar cell \u2014
p161
aVbecause the sun's moving across the sky,
p162
aVthe solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance
p163
aVat the off-axis angles.
p164
aVIt collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day.
p165
aVSo even this, although it was great with no moving parts \u2014
p166
aVwe could achieve high temperatures \u2014 wasn't enough.
p167
aa(lp168
VWe needed to beat solar cells.
p169
aVSo we took a look at another idea.
p170
aVWe looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track.
p171
aVSo what you see here is 12 separate petals
p172
aVthat each could be controlled with individual microprocessors
p173
aVthat would only cost a dollar.
p174
aVYou can buy a two-megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now.
p175
aVAnd you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out
p176
aVbecause they have no brushes,
p177
aVfor a dollar.
p178
aVSo we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars
p179
aVand what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more,
p180
aVbut only move the petals.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe whole system would have a much lower profile,
p183
aVbut also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day.
p184
aVNow that we have concentrated sunlight,
p185
aVwhat are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity?
p186
aVSo we tried to look at all the different heat engines
p187
aVthat have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity,
p188
aVAnd one of the great ones of all time,
p189
aVJames Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough.
p190
aVJames Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it.
p191
aVBut his refinements were incredible.
p192
aVHe added new linear motion guides to the pistons,
p193
aVhe added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder,
p194
aVhe made the engine double-acting, so it had double the power.
p195
aa(lp196
VThose were major breakthroughs. All of the improvements he made \u2014
p197
aVand it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt,
p198
aVtoday is named after him.
p199
aVSo we looked at this engine, and this had some potential.
p200
aVSteam engines are dangerous,
p201
aVand they had tremendous impact on the world \u2014
p202
aVindustrial revolution and ships and locomotives.
p203
aVBut they're usually good to be large,
p204
aVso they're not good for distributed power generation.
p205
aVThey're also very high-pressure, so they're dangerous.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnother type of engine is the hot air engine.
p208
aVAnd the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling,
p209
aVbut Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
p210
aVThis engine, because it was so interesting \u2014
p211
aVit only worked on air, no steam \u2014
p212
aVhas led to hundreds of creative designs over the years
p213
aVthat use the Stirling engine principle.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut after the Stirling engine, Otto came along,
p216
aVand also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine,
p217
aVhe just refined it.
p218
aVHe showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement
p219
aVbecause it brought the power density of the engine way up.
p220
aVYou could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space,
p221
aVand that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
p222
aVSo, once you have mobility,
p223
aVyou're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units,
p224
aVas opposed to steam ships or big factories,
p225
aVso this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production
p226
aVwhere all the other engines didn't.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo, because it went into mass production,
p229
aVcosts were reduced, 100 years of refinement,
p230
aVemissions were reduced, tremendous production value.
p231
aVThere have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built,
p232
aVcompared to thousands of Stirling engines built.
p233
aVAnd not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore,
p234
aVonly large ones for big operations.
p235
aVSo after looking at these three, and 47 others,
p236
aVwe concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use.
p237
aVI want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way,
p240
aVbecause it was practical \u2014
p241
aVweight no longer mattered for our application.
p242
aVThe internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered,
p243
aVbecause you were moving around.
p244
aVBut if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place
p245
aVthe weight doesn't matter so much.
p246
aa(lp247
VWe also discovered that efficiency doesn't matter so much
p248
aVif your energy source is free.
p249
aVNormally, efficiency is crucial
p250
aVbecause the fuel cost of your engine over its life
p251
aVdwarfs the cost of the engine.
p252
aVBut if your fuel source is free,
p253
aVthen the only thing that matters
p254
aVis the up-front capital cost of the engine.
p255
aVSo you don't want to optimize for efficiency,
p256
aVyou want to optimize for power per dollar.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo using that new twist, with the new criteria,
p259
aVwe thought we could relook at the Stirling engine,
p260
aVand also bring genetic algorithms in.
p261
aVBasically, Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him
p262
aVto get us three gigahertz of processor power.
p263
aVSo we took the same genetic algorithm
p264
aVthat we used earlier to make that concentrator,
p265
aVwhich didn't work out for us,
p266
aVto optimize the Stirling engine,
p267
aVand make its design sizes and all of its dimensions
p268
aVthe exact optimum to get the most power per dollar,
p269
aVirrespective of weight, irrespective of size,
p270
aVjust to get the most conversion of solar energy,
p271
aVbecause the sun is free.
p272
aVAnd that's the process we took \u2014 let me show you how the engine works.
p273
aa(lp274
VThe simplest heat engine, or hot air engine, of all time
p275
aVwould be this \u2014 take a box, a steel canister, with a piston.
p276
aVPut a flame under it, the piston moves up.
p277
aVTake it off the flame and pour water on it, or let it cool down,
p278
aVthe piston moves down.
p279
aVThat's a heat engine.
p280
aVThat's the most fundamental heat engine you could have.
p281
aVThe problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent,
p282
aVbecause you're heating all the metal of the chamber
p283
aVand then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time.
p284
aVAnd you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time,
p285
aVbut you're wasting energy heating and cooling the metal.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo someone came up with a very clever idea.
p288
aVInstead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder,
p289
aVwhat about if you put a displacer inside \u2014
p290
aVa little thing that shuttles the air back and forth.
p291
aVYou move that up and down with a little bit of energy
p292
aVbut now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end.
p293
aVSo, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, just the air.
p294
aVThat allows you to get the efficiency up
p295
aVfrom a hundredth of a percent to about two percent.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea,
p298
aVwhich was, well, I'm still not heating the metal now,
p299
aVwith this kind of engine,
p300
aVbut I'm still reheating all the air.
p301
aVI'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time.
p302
aVWhat about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle,
p303
aVin the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?
p304
aVSo he made fine wires, and cracked glass,
p305
aVand all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.
p306
aVSo when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end,
p307
aVit puts some heat into the sponge.
p308
aVAnd then when the air comes back after it's been cooled,
p309
aVit picks up that heat again.
p310
aVSo you're reusing your energy five or six times,
p311
aVand that brings the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent.
p312
aVIt's a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling
p313
aVthat takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical \u2014
p314
aVlike I found out when I made the real simple version in high school \u2014
p315
aVto very potentially possible,
p316
aVonce you get the efficiency up,
p317
aVif you can design this to be low enough cost.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible.
p320
aVWe built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works.
p321
aVWe applied the genetic algorithm.
p322
aVWe got the results from that for the optimal engine.
p323
aVWe built engines \u2014
p324
aVso we built 100 different engines over the last two years.
p325
aVWe measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured,
p326
aVand then we led that to the current prototype.
p327
aVIt led to a very compact, inexpensive engine,
p328
aVand this is what the engine looks like.
p329
aa(lp330
VLet me show you what it looks like in real life.
p331
aVSo this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here,
p332
aVwhich holds the generator inside and all the linkage,
p333
aVand it's the hot cap \u2014 the hot cylinder on the top \u2014
p334
aVthis part gets hot, this part is cool,
p335
aVand electricity comes out.
p336
aVThe exact converse is also true.
p337
aVIf you put electricity in, this will get hot and this will get cold,
p338
aVyou get refrigeration.
p339
aVSo it's a complete reversible cycle,
p340
aVa very efficient cycle, and quite a simple thing to make.
p341
aVSo now you put the two things together.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo you have the engine.
p344
aVWhat if you combine the petals and the engine in the center?
p345
aVThe petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight,
p346
aVtakes that heat and turns it into electricity.
p347
aVThis is what the first prototype of our system looked like
p348
aVwith the petals and the engine in the center.
p349
aVThis is being run out in the sun,
p350
aVand now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo this is a unit with the 12 petals.
p357
aVThese petals cost about a dollar each \u2014
p358
aVthey're lightweight, injection-molded plastic, aluminized.
p359
aVThe mechanism to control each petal is below there,
p360
aVwith a microprocessor on each one.
p361
aVThere are thermocouples on the engine \u2014
p362
aVlittle sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.
p363
aVEach petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
p364
aVWhen the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun,
p365
aVfind it by searching for the highest temperature.
p366
aVAbout a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap
p367
aVthe engine will be warm enough to start
p368
aVand then the engine will generate electricity
p369
aVfor about six and a half hours a day \u2014
p370
aVsix and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky.
p371
aa(lp372
VA critical part that we can take advantage of
p373
aVis that we have these inexpensive microprocessors
p374
aVand each of these petals is autonomous,
p375
aVand each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup.
p376
aVSo you don't have to tell what latitude, longitude you're at,
p377
aVwhat your roof slope angle is, or what orientation.
p378
aVIt doesn't really care.
p379
aVWhat it does is it searches to find the hottest spot,
p380
aVit searches again a half an hour later, a day later, a month later.
p381
aVIt basically figures out where on Earth you are
p382
aVby watching the direction the sun moves,
p383
aVso you don't have to actually enter anything about that.
p384
aa(lp385
VThe way the unit works is,
p386
aVwhen the sun comes out, the engine will start
p387
aVand you get power out here.
p388
aVWe have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,
p389
aVso that could be used for certain applications.
p390
aVWe have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC.
p391
aVAnd you also get hot water. The hot water's optional.
p392
aVYou don't have to use it, it will cool itself.
p393
aVBut you can use it to optionally heat hot water
p394
aVand that brings the efficiency up even higher
p395
aVbecause some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting,
p396
aVyou can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water.
p397
aa(lp398
VLet me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running.
p399
aVThis is the first test where we took it outside
p400
aVand each of the petals were individually seeking.
p401
aVAnd what they do is step, very coarsely at first,
p402
aVand very finely afterward.
p403
aVOnce they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple
p404
aVindicating they found the sun,
p405
aVthey slow down and do a fine search.
p406
aVThen the petals will move into position, and the engine will start.
p407
aa(lp408
VWe've been working on this for the last two years.
p409
aVWe're very excited about the progress, we have a long way to go though.
p410
aVThis is how we envision it would be in a residential installation:
p411
aVyou'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.
p412
aVIt could be on your roof, your backyard, or somewhere else.
p413
aVYou don't have to have enough units to power your entire house,
p414
aVyou just save money with each incremental one you add.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo you're still using the grid potentially,
p417
aVin this type of application, to be your backup supply \u2014
p418
aVof course, you can't use these at night, and you can't use these on cloudy days.
p419
aVBut by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times \u2014
p420
aVusually when you have your air conditioning on,
p421
aVor other times like that \u2014
p422
aVthis generates the peak power at the peak usage time,
p423
aVso it's very complementary in that sense.
p424
aa(lp425
VThis is how we would envision a residential application.
p426
aVWe also think there's very big potential for energy farms,
p427
aVespecially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun.
p428
aVIt's a really good combination of those two factors.
p429
aVIt turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world, obviously,
p430
aVbut in special places
p431
aVwhere it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these
p432
aVand also in many more places where there is high wind power.
p433
aVSo an example of that is, here's the map of the United States.
p434
aVPretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place,
p435
aVbut even the green or blue areas are good,
p436
aVjust not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow.
p437
aVBut the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley is very good.
p438
aVAnd is only affects the payback period,
p439
aVit doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy;
p440
aVyou could use it anywhere on Earth.
p441
aVIt just affects the payback period
p442
aVif you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity.
p443
aVBut if you don't have grid-supplied electricity,
p444
aVthen the question of payback is a different one entirely.
p445
aVIt's just how many watts do you get per dollar,
p446
aVand how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way.
p447
aa(lp448
VThis is the map of the whole Earth,
p449
aVand you can see a huge swathe in the middle
p450
aVwhere a large part of the population is,
p451
aVthere's tremendous chances for solar energy.
p452
aVAnd of course, look at Africa.
p453
aVThe potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable,
p454
aVand I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that.
p455
aa(lp456
VSo, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me
p457
aVthat you can revisit old ideas in a new light,
p458
aVand sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past
p459
aVcan be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists.
p460
aVWe believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable.
p461
aVOur short-term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells
p462
aVand our longer-term goal is to be less than a five-year payback.
p463
aVAnd at less than a five-year payback, this becomes very economic.
p464
aVSo you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy
p465
aVto want to have one of these.
p466
aVIt just makes economic sense.
p467
aVRight now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.
p468
aVIf you get it down below five years,
p469
aVthen it's almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it \u2014
p470
aVsomeone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one.
p471
aVSo that's our real powerful goal
p472
aVthat we're really shooting for in the company.
p473
aa(lp474
VTwo other things that I learned that were very surprising to me \u2014
p475
aVone was how casual we are about energy.
p476
aVI was walking from the elevator over here,
p477
aVand even just looking at the stage right now \u2014
p478
aVso there's probably 20,500-watt lights right now.
p479
aVThere's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage,
p480
aVone horsepower is 746 watts, at full power.
p481
aVSo there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit.
p482
aVNot to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now
p483
aVto keep the air-conditioning going.
p484
aVAnd it's just amazing,
p485
aVwalk in the elevator, and there's lights on in the elevator.
p486
aVOf course, now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake.
p487
aa(lp488
VBut, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy
p489
aVbecause it's so cheap.
p490
aVAnd it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy
p491
aVthat's been concentrated by the sun.
p492
aVBasically, oil is solar-energy concentrate.
p493
aVIt's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy
p494
aVto make it have all that energy contained in it.
p495
aVAnd we don't have a birthright
p496
aVto just use that up as fast as we are, I think.
p497
aVAnd it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable,
p498
aVwhere as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace,
p499
aVand I really hope we can get there.
