VThis story
p4
aVis about taking imagination seriously.
p5
aVFourteen years ago,
p6
aVI first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,
p7
aVused the same way for centuries.
p8
aVToday, I'm using it to create
p9
aVpermanent, billowing, voluptuous forms
p10
aVthe scale of hard-edged buildings
p11
aVin cities around the world.
p12
aVI was an unlikely person to be doing this.
p13
aVI never studied sculpture,
p14
aVengineering or architecture.
p15
aVIn fact, after college
p16
aVI applied to seven art schools
p17
aVand was rejected by all seven.
p18
aa(lp19
VI went off on my own to become an artist,
p20
aVand I painted for 10 years,
p21
aVwhen I was offered a Fulbright to India.
p22
aVPromising to give exhibitions of paintings,
p23
aVI shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
p24
aVThe deadline for the show arrived \u2014
p25
aVmy paints didn't.
p26
aVI had to do something.
p27
aVThis fishing village was famous for sculpture.
p28
aVSo I tried bronze casting.
p29
aVBut to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
p30
aVI went for a walk on the beach,
p31
aVwatching the fishermen
p32
aVbundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
p33
aVI'd seen it every day,
p34
aVbut this time I saw it differently \u2014
p35
aVa new approach to sculpture,
p36
aVa way to make volumetric form
p37
aVwithout heavy solid materials.
p38
aa(lp39
VMy first satisfying sculpture
p40
aVwas made in collaboration with these fishermen.
p41
aVIt's a self-portrait
p42
aVtitled "Wide Hips."
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVWe hoisted them on poles to photograph.
p45
aVI discovered
p46
aVtheir soft surfaces
p47
aVrevealed every ripple of wind
p48
aVin constantly changing patterns.
p49
aVI was mesmerized.
p50
aVI continued studying craft traditions
p51
aVand collaborating with artisans,
p52
aVnext in Lithuania with lace makers.
p53
aVI liked the fine detail
p54
aVit gave my work,
p55
aVbut I wanted to make them larger \u2014
p56
aVto shift from being an object you look at
p57
aVto something you could get lost in.
p58
aa(lp59
VReturning to India to work with those fishermen,
p60
aVwe made a net
p61
aVof a million and a half hand-tied knots \u2014
p62
aVinstalled briefly in Madrid.
p63
aVThousands of people saw it,
p64
aVand one of them was the urbanist
p65
aVManual Sola-Morales
p66
aVwho was redesigning the waterfront
p67
aVin Porto, Portugal.
p68
aVHe asked if I could build this
p69
aVas a permanent piece for the city.
p70
aVI didn't know if I could do that
p71
aVand preserve my art.
p72
aVDurable, engineered, permanent \u2014
p73
aVthose are in opposition
p74
aVto idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
p75
aa(lp76
VFor two years, I searched for a fiber
p77
aVthat could survive ultraviolet rays,
p78
aVsalt, air, pollution,
p79
aVand at the same time remain soft enough
p80
aVto move fluidly in the wind.
p81
aVWe needed something to hold the net up
p82
aVout there in the middle of the traffic circle.
p83
aVSo we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
p84
aVWe had to engineer it
p85
aVto move gracefully in an average breeze
p86
aVand survive in hurricane winds.
p87
aVBut there was no engineering software
p88
aVto model something porous and moving.
p89
aVI found a brilliant aeronautical engineer
p90
aVwho designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts
p91
aVnamed Peter Heppel.
p92
aVHe helped me tackle the twin challenges
p93
aVof precise shape
p94
aVand gentle movement.
p95
aa(lp96
VI couldn't build this the way I knew
p97
aVbecause hand-tied knots
p98
aVweren't going to withstand a hurricane.
p99
aVSo I developed a relationship
p100
aVwith an industrial fishnet factory,
p101
aVlearned the variables of their machines,
p102
aVand figured out a way
p103
aVto make lace with them.
p104
aVThere was no language
p105
aVto translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft
p106
aVinto something machine operators could produce.
p107
aVSo we had to create one.
p108
aVThree years and two children later,
p109
aVwe raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
p110
aVIt was hard to believe
p111
aVthat what I had imagined
p112
aVwas now built, permanent
p113
aVand had lost nothing in translation.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VThis intersection had been bland and anonymous.
p118
aVNow it had a sense of place.
p119
aVI walked underneath it
p120
aVfor the first time.
p121
aVAs I watched the wind's choreography unfold,
p122
aVI felt sheltered
p123
aVand, at the same time,
p124
aVconnected to limitless sky.
p125
aVMy life was not going to be the same.
p126
aVI want to create these oases of sculpture
p127
aVin spaces of cities around the world.
p128
aVI'm going to share two directions
p129
aVthat are new in my work.
p130
aa(lp131
VHistoric Philadelphia City Hall:
p132
aVits plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture
p133
aVthat was lighter than netting.
p134
aVSo we experimented
p135
aVwith tiny atomized water particles
p136
aVto create a dry mist
p137
aVthat is shaped by the wind
p138
aVand in testing, discovered
p139
aVthat it can be shaped by people
p140
aVwho can interact and move through it without getting wet.
p141
aVI'm using this sculpture material
p142
aVto trace the paths of subway trains above ground
p143
aVin real time \u2014
p144
aVlike an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
p145
aa(lp146
VNext challenge,
p147
aVthe Biennial of the Americas in Denver
p148
aVasked, could I represent
p149
aVthe 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness
p150
aVin a sculpture?
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVI didn't know where to begin,
p153
aVbut I said yes.
p154
aVI read about the recent earthquake in Chile
p155
aVand the tsunami that rippled across
p156
aVthe entire Pacific Ocean.
p157
aVIt shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,
p158
aVsped up the planet's rotation
p159
aVand literally shortened the length of the day.
p160
aVSo I contacted NOAA,
p161
aVand I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,
p162
aVand translated it into this.
p163
aVIts title: "1.26"
p164
aVrefers to the number of microseconds
p165
aVthat the Earth's day was shortened.
p166
aa(lp167
VI couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
p168
aVIts shape was too complex now.
p169
aVSo I replaced the metal armature
p170
aVwith a soft, fine mesh
p171
aVof a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
p172
aVThe sculpture could now be entirely soft,
p173
aVwhich made it so light
p174
aVit could tie in to existing buildings \u2014
p175
aVliterally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
p176
aVThere was no software
p177
aVthat could extrude these complex net forms
p178
aVand model them with gravity.
p179
aVSo we had to create it.
p180
aa(lp181
VThen I got a call from New York City
p182
aVasking if I could adapt these concepts
p183
aVto Times Square
p184
aVor the High Line.
p185
aVThis new soft structural method
p186
aVenables me to model these
p187
aVand build these sculptures
p188
aVat the scale of skyscrapers.
p189
aVThey don't have funding yet,
p190
aVbut I dream now
p191
aVof bringing these to cities around the world
p192
aVwhere they're most needed.
p193
aa(lp194
VFourteen years ago,
p195
aVI searched for beauty
p196
aVin the traditional things,
p197
aVin craft forms.
p198
aVNow I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering
p199
aVto create voluptuous, billowing forms
p200
aVthe scale of buildings.
p201
aVMy artistic horizons continue to grow.
p202
aa(lp203
VI'll leave you with this story.
p204
aVI got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
p205
aVAn attorney in the office
p206
aVwho'd never been interested in art,
p207
aVnever visited the local art museum,
p208
aVdragged everyone she could from the building
p209
aVand got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
p210
aVThere they were in their business suits,
p211
aVlaying in the grass,
p212
aVnoticing the changing patterns of wind
p213
aVbeside people they didn't know,
p214
aVsharing the rediscovery of wonder.
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you. Thank you.
p221
aVThank you.
p222
aVThank you. Thank you.
