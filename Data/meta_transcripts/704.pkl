VI'm talking to you about
p4
aVthe worst form of human rights violation,
p5
aVthe third-largest organized crime,
p6
aVa $10 billion industry.
p7
aVI'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'd like to tell you the story
p10
aVof these three children,
p11
aVPranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
p12
aVPranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,
p13
aVa prostituted person.
p14
aVShe got infected with HIV,
p15
aVand towards the end of her life,
p16
aVwhen she was in the final stages of AIDS,
p17
aVshe could not prostitute,
p18
aVso she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
p19
aVBy the time we got the information, we reached there,
p20
aVPranitha was already raped by three men.
p21
aa(lp22
VShaheen's background I don't even know.
p23
aVWe found her in a railway track,
p24
aVraped by many, many men, I don't know many.
p25
aVBut the indications of that on her body was
p26
aVthat her intestine was outside her body.
p27
aVAnd when we took her to the hospital
p28
aVshe needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
p29
aVWe still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
p30
aVAll that we know that hundreds of men
p31
aVhad used her brutally.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnjali's father, a drunkard,
p34
aVsold his child for pornography.
p35
aVYou're seeing here images of
p36
aVthree years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children
p37
aVwho have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
p38
aVIn this country, and across the globe,
p39
aVhundreds and thousands of children,
p40
aVas young as three, as young as four,
p41
aVare sold into sexual slavery.
p42
aVBut that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
p43
aVThey are sold in the name of adoption.
p44
aVThey are sold in the name of organ trade.
p45
aVThey are sold in the name of forced labor,
p46
aVcamel jockeying, anything, everything.
p47
aa(lp48
VI work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.
p49
aVAnd I tell you stories from there.
p50
aVMy own journey to work with these children
p51
aVstarted as a teenager.
p52
aVI was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
p53
aVI don't remember the rape part of it so much
p54
aVas much as the anger part of it.
p55
aVYes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,
p56
aVbut that didn't go into my consciousness.
p57
aVI never felt like a victim, then or now.
p58
aVBut what lingered from then till now \u2014 I am 40 today \u2014
p59
aVis this huge outrageous anger.
p60
aa(lp61
VTwo years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,
p62
aVbecause I was a victim.
p63
aVAnd that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
p64
aVWe, as a society, we have PhDs
p65
aVin victimizing a victim.
p66
aVRight from the age of 15,
p67
aVwhen I started looking around me,
p68
aVI started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children
p69
aVwho are left in sexual slavery-like practices,
p70
aVbut have absolutely no respite,
p71
aVbecause we don't allow them to come in.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhere does their journey begin?
p74
aVMost of them come from very optionless families,
p75
aVnot just poor.
p76
aVYou have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
p77
aVI had this I.S. officer's daughter,
p78
aVwho is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,
p79
aVwho was raped chatting with one individual,
p80
aVand ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,
p81
aVwho was trafficked.
p82
aVI have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,
p83
aVand children from well-to-do families,
p84
aVwho are getting trafficked.
p85
aa(lp86
VThese people are deceived, forced.
p87
aV99.9 percent of them
p88
aVresist being inducted into prostitution.
p89
aVSome pay the price for it.
p90
aVThey're killed; we don't even hear about them.
p91
aVThey are voiceless, [unclear],
p92
aVnameless people.
p93
aVBut the rest, who succumb into it,
p94
aVgo through everyday torture.
p95
aVBecause the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,
p96
aVor who want to have a family with you.
p97
aVThese are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,
p98
aVand use you, throw you.
p99
aa(lp100
VEach of the girls that I have rescued \u2014
p101
aVI have rescued more than 3,200 girls \u2014
p102
aVeach of them tell me one story in common ...
p103
aV(Applause)
p104
aVone story about one man, at least,
p105
aVputting chili powder in her vagina,
p106
aVone man taking a cigarette and burning her,
p107
aVone man whipping her.
p108
aVWe are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,
p109
aVuncles, cousins, all around us.
p110
aVAnd we are silent about them.
p111
aa(lp112
VWe think it is easy money.
p113
aVWe think it is shortcut.
p114
aVWe think the person likes to do what she's doing.
p115
aVBut the extra bonuses that she gets
p116
aVis various infections, sexually transmitted infections,
p117
aVHIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,
p118
aVsubstance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
p119
aVAnd one day she gives up on you and me,
p120
aVbecause we have no options for her.
p121
aVAnd therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
p122
aVShe believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
p123
aVAnd this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
p124
aVAnd it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
p125
aVIt's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
p126
aa(lp127
VIt's in that context that I work.
p128
aVIt's in that context that I rescue children.
p129
aVI've rescued children as young as three years,
p130
aVand I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
p131
aVWhen I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had
p132
aVwas where do I begin.
p133
aVBecause I had lots of them
p134
aVwho were already HIV infected.
p135
aVOne third of the people I rescue
p136
aVare HIV positive.
p137
aVAnd therefore my challenge was to
p138
aVunderstand how can I get out
p139
aVthe power from this pain.
p140
aVAnd for me, I was my greatest experience.
p141
aVUnderstanding my own self,
p142
aVunderstanding my own pain,
p143
aVmy own isolation,
p144
aVwas my greatest teacher.
p145
aVBecause what we did with these girls
p146
aVis to understand their potential.
p147
aa(lp148
VYou see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
p149
aVShe works for a very big company,
p150
aVa workshop in Hyderabad,
p151
aVmaking furnitures.
p152
aVShe earns around 12,000 rupees.
p153
aVShe is an illiterate girl,
p154
aVtrained, skilled as a welder.
p155
aVWhy welding and why not computers?
p156
aVWe felt, one of the things that these girls had
p157
aVis immense amount of courage.
p158
aVThey did not have any pardas inside their body,
p159
aVhijabs inside themselves;
p160
aVthey've crossed the barrier of it.
p161
aVAnd therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,
p162
aVvery easily, and not feel very shy about it.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe have trained girls as carpenters,
p165
aVas masons,
p166
aVas security guards, as cab drivers.
p167
aVAnd each one of them are excelling
p168
aVin their chosen field,
p169
aVgaining confidence, restoring dignity,
p170
aVand building hopes in their own lives.
p171
aVThese girls are also working in big construction companies
p172
aVlike Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat has been my challenge?
p175
aVMy challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
p176
aVI've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
p177
aVI can't hear from my right ear.
p178
aVI've lost a staff of mine who was murdered
p179
aVwhile on a rescue.
p180
aVMy biggest challenge
p181
aVis society.
p182
aVIt's you and me.
p183
aVMy biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims
p184
aVas our own.
p185
aa(lp186
VA very supportive friend of mine,
p187
aVa well-wisher of mine,
p188
aVused to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
p189
aVWhen her mother fell sick she said,
p190
aV"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
p191
aVCan you get somebody in my house to work,
p192
aVso that she can look after my mother?"
p193
aVAnd there is a long pause.
p194
aVAnd then she says, "Not one of our girls."
p195
aa(lp196
VIt's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,
p197
aVin this fantastic A-C hall.
p198
aVIt's very nice for discussion, discourse,
p199
aVmaking films and everything.
p200
aVBut it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
p201
aVIt's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
p202
aVIt's not nice for our children to study with their children.
p203
aVThere it ends.
p204
aVThat's my biggest challenge.
p205
aa(lp206
VIf I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.
p207
aVI'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
p208
aVThey need your compassion.
p209
aVThey need your empathy.
p210
aVThey need, much more than anything else,
p211
aVyour acceptance.
p212
aa(lp213
VMany times when I talk to people,
p214
aVI keep telling them one thing:
p215
aVdon't tell me hundred ways
p216
aVhow you cannot respond to this problem.
p217
aVCan you ply your mind for that one way
p218
aVthat you can respond to the problem?
p219
aVAnd that's what I'm here for,
p220
aVasking for your support,
p221
aVdemanding for your support,
p222
aVrequesting for your support.
p223
aVCan you break your culture of silence?
p224
aVCan you speak to at least two persons about this story?
p225
aVTell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.
p226
aa(lp227
VI'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis
p228
aVor Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,
p229
aVor something like that.
p230
aVI'm asking you, in your limited world,
p231
aVcan you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
p232
aVCan you just encompass these people too?
p233
aVBecause they are also a part of us.
p234
aVThey are also part of this world.
p235
aVI'm asking you, for these children,
p236
aVwhose faces you see, they're no more.
p237
aVThey died of AIDS last year.
p238
aVI'm asking you to help them,
p239
aVaccept as human beings \u2014
p240
aVnot as philanthropy, not as charity,
p241
aVbut as human beings who deserve all our support.
p242
aVI'm asking you this because no child, no human being,
p243
aVdeserves what these children have gone through.
p244
aVThank you.
