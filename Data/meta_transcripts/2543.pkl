VI am British.

p8
aa(lp9
VNever before has the phrase "I am British" elicited so much pity.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI come from an island where many of us like to believe
p14
aVthere's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years.
p15
aVWe tend to have historically imposed change on others
p16
aVbut done much less of it ourselves.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo it came as an immense shock to me
p19
aVwhen I woke up on the morning of June 24
p20
aVto discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union,
p21
aVmy Prime Minister had resigned,
p22
aVand Scotland was considering a referendum
p23
aVthat could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom.
p24
aVSo that was an immense shock for me,
p25
aVand it was an immense shock for many people,
p26
aVbut it was also something that, over the following several days,
p27
aVcreated a complete political meltdown
p28
aVin my country.
p29
aVThere were calls for a second referendum,
p30
aValmost as if, following a sports match,
p31
aVwe could ask the opposition for a replay.
p32
aVEverybody was blaming everybody else.
p33
aVPeople blamed the Prime Minister
p34
aVfor calling the referendum in the first place.
p35
aVThey blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough.
p36
aVThe young accused the old.
p37
aVThe educated blamed the less well-educated.
p38
aVThat complete meltdown was made even worse
p39
aVby the most tragic element of it:
p40
aVlevels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain
p41
aVat a level that I have never seen before
p42
aVin my lifetime.
p43
aVPeople are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England,
p44
aVor, as one of my colleagues put it,
p45
aVwhether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park
p46
aVfloating in the Atlantic Ocean.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBut my question is really,
p51
aVshould we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since?
p52
aVWas it something that took place overnight?
p53
aVOr are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today?
p54
aVSo I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions.
p55
aVFirst, what does Brexit represent,
p56
aVnot just for my country,
p57
aVbut for all of us around the world?
p58
aVAnd second, what can we do about it?
p59
aVHow should we all respond?
p60
aa(lp61
VSo first, what does Brexit represent?
p62
aVHindsight is a wonderful thing.
p63
aVBrexit teaches us many things about our society
p64
aVand about societies around the world.
p65
aVIt highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of
p66
aVhow divided our societies are.
p67
aVThe vote split along lines of age, education, class and geography.
p68
aVYoung people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers,
p69
aVbut those that did wanted to remain.
p70
aVOlder people really wanted to leave the European Union.
p71
aVGeographically, it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed
p72
aVto being part of the European Union,
p73
aVwhile in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence.
p74
aVThose divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously.
p75
aVBut more profoundly, the vote teaches us something
p76
aVabout the nature of politics today.
p77
aVContemporary politics is no longer just about right and left.
p78
aVIt's no longer just about tax and spend.
p79
aVIt's about globalization.
p80
aVThe fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization
p81
aVand those that fear globalization.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VIf we look at why those who wanted to leave \u2014
p86
aVwe call them "Leavers," as opposed to "Remainers" \u2014
p87
aVwe see two factors in the opinion polls
p88
aVthat really mattered.
p89
aVThe first was immigration, and the second sovereignty,
p90
aVand these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives
p91
aVand the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians.
p92
aVBut those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation.
p93
aVThey represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders
p94
aVin ways that many of us would reject.
p95
aVWhat I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that,
p96
aVthat liberal internationalists,
p97
aVlike myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture,
p98
aVneed to write ourselves back into the picture
p99
aVin order to understand how we've got to where we are today.
p100
aVWhen we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom,
p101
aVwe can visibly see the divisions.
p102
aVThe blue areas show Remain
p103
aVand the red areas Leave.
p104
aVWhen I looked at this,
p105
aVwhat personally struck me was the very little time in my life
p106
aVI've actually spent in many of the red areas.
p107
aVI suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the UK
p108
aVthat have the strongest Leave vote,
p109
aVI've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas.
p110
aVIn some of those places,
p111
aVI didn't even know the names of the voting districts.
p112
aVIt was a real shock to me,
p113
aVand it suggested that people like me
p114
aVwho think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant,
p115
aVperhaps don't know our own countries and societies
p116
aVnearly as well as we like to believe.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way
p121
aVto narrate globalization to those people,
p122
aVto recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university,
p123
aVwho haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet,
p124
aVthat don't get opportunities to travel,
p125
aVthey may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive
p126
aVin our often liberal bubbles.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VIt means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand.
p131
aVIn the Leave vote, a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred,
p132
aVcreating lies and mistrust
p133
aVaround, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe
p134
aVcould reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,
p135
aVwhen the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration
p136
aVfrom outside the European Union.
p137
aVBut for a significant majority of the Leave voters
p138
aVthe concern was disillusionment with the political establishment.
p139
aVThis was a protest vote for many,
p140
aVa sense that nobody represented them,
p141
aVthat they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them,
p142
aVand so they rejected that political establishment.
p143
aa(lp144
VThis replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world.
p145
aVWe see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States,
p146
aVwith the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary,
p147
aVwith the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France.
p148
aVThe specter of Brexit is in all of our societies.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo the question I think we need to ask is my second question,
p151
aVwhich is how should we collectively respond?
p152
aVFor all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies,
p153
aVwe urgently need a new vision,
p154
aVa vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization,
p155
aVone that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind.
p156
aa(lp157
VThat vision of globalization
p158
aVis one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization.
p159
aVThe consensus amongst economists
p160
aVis that free trade, the movement of capital,
p161
aVthe movement of people across borders
p162
aVbenefit everyone on aggregate.
p163
aVThe consensus amongst international relations scholars
p164
aVis that globalization brings interdependence,
p165
aVwhich brings cooperation and peace.
p166
aVBut globalization also has redistributive effects.
p167
aVIt creates winners and losers.
p168
aVTo take the example of migration,
p169
aVwe know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole
p170
aVunder almost all circumstances.
p171
aVBut we also have to be very aware
p172
aVthat there are redistributive consequences,
p173
aVthat importantly, low-skilled immigration
p174
aVcan lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies
p175
aVand also put pressure on house prices.
p176
aVThat doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive,
p177
aVbut it means more people have to share in those benefits
p178
aVand recognize them.
p179
aa(lp180
VIn 2002, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,
p181
aVgave a speech at Yale University,
p182
aVand that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization.
p183
aVThat was the speech in which he coined that term.
p184
aVAnd he said, and I paraphrase,
p185
aV"The glass house of globalization has to be open to all
p186
aVif it is to remain secure.
p187
aVBigotry and ignorance
p188
aVare the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization."
p189
aa(lp190
VThat idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008
p191
aVin a conference on progressive governance
p192
aVinvolving many of the leaders of European countries.
p193
aVBut amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008,
p194
aVthe concept disappeared almost without a trace.
p195
aVGlobalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda.
p196
aVIt's perceived to be part of an elite agenda
p197
aVrather than something that benefits all.
p198
aVAnd it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis
p199
aVthan it is today.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo the question is, how can we achieve that goal?
p202
aVHow can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation
p203
aVwhile on the other hand refusing vehemently
p204
aVto give in to xenophobia and nationalism?
p205
aVThat is the question for all of us.
p206
aVAnd I think, as a social scientist,
p207
aVthat social science offers some places to start.
p208
aVOur transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change,
p209
aVand I want to give you four ideas as a starting point.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe first relates to the idea of civic education.
p212
aVWhat stands out from Brexit
p213
aVis the gap between public perception and empirical reality.
p214
aVIt's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society,
p215
aVwhere evidence and truth no longer matter,
p216
aVand lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence.
p217
aVSo how can we \u2014
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VHow can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies?
p222
aVIt has to begin with education,
p223
aVbut it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps.
p224
aa(lp225
VIn 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI
p226
aVpublished a survey on attitudes to immigration,
p227
aVand it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase,
p228
aVso public concern with immigration also increases,
p229
aValthough it obviously didn't unpack causality,
p230
aVbecause this could equally be to do not so much with numbers
p231
aVbut the political and media narrative around it.
p232
aVBut the same survey also revealed
p233
aVhuge public misinformation
p234
aVand misunderstanding about the nature of immigration.
p235
aVFor example, in these attitudes in the United Kingdom,
p236
aVthe public believed that levels of asylum
p237
aVwere a greater proportion of immigration than they were,
p238
aVbut they also believed the levels of educational migration
p239
aVwere far lower as a proportion of overall migration
p240
aVthan they actually are.
p241
aVSo we have to address this misinformation,
p242
aVthe gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization.
p243
aVAnd that can't just be something that's left to our schools,
p244
aValthough that's important to begin at an early age.
p245
aVIt has to be about lifelong civic participation
p246
aVand public engagement that we all encourage as societies.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe second thing that I think is an opportunity
p249
aVis the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VOne of the things that stands out for me very strikingly,
p254
aVlooking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom,
p255
aVis that ironically, the regions of my country
p256
aVthat are the most tolerant of immigrants
p257
aVhave the highest numbers of immigrants.
p258
aVSo for instance, London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants,
p259
aVand they are also by far the most tolerant areas.
p260
aVIt's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration
p261
aVthat actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo we need to encourage exchange programs.
p264
aVWe need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel
p265
aVget access to the Internet.
p266
aVWe need to encourage, even on a local and national level,
p267
aVmore movement, more participation,
p268
aVmore interaction with people who we don't know
p269
aVand whose views we might not necessarily agree with.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe third thing that I think is crucial, though,
p272
aVand this is really fundamental,
p273
aVis we have to ensure that everybody shares
p274
aVin the benefits of globalization.
p275
aVThis illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking.
p276
aVIt shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union
p277
aVwere those who actually benefited the most materially
p278
aVfrom trade with the European Union.
p279
aVBut the problem is that those people in those areas
p280
aVdidn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries.
p281
aVThey didn't believe that they were actually getting access
p282
aVto material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world.
p283
aa(lp284
VI work on questions predominantly to do with refugees,
p285
aVand one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching,
p286
aVmainly to developing countries around the world,
p287
aVis that in order to encourage the integration of refugees,
p288
aVwe can't just benefit the refugee populations,
p289
aVwe also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas.
p290
aVBut in looking at that,
p291
aVone of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide
p292
aVdisproportionately better education facilities, health facilities,
p293
aVaccess to social services
p294
aVin those regions of high immigration
p295
aVto address the concerns of those local populations.
p296
aVBut while we encourage that around the developing world,
p297
aVwe don't take those lessons home
p298
aVand incorporate them in our own societies.
p299
aa(lp300
VFurthermore, if we're going to really take seriously
p301
aVthe need to ensure people share in the economic benefits,
p302
aVour businesses and corporations need a model of globalization
p303
aVthat recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe fourth and final idea I want to put forward
p306
aVis an idea that we need more responsible politics.
p307
aVThere's very little social science evidence
p308
aVthat compares attitudes on globalization.
p309
aVBut from the surveys that do exist,
p310
aVwhat we can see is there's huge variation across different countries
p311
aVand time periods in those countries
p312
aVfor attitudes and tolerance
p313
aVof questions like migration and mobility on the one hand
p314
aVand free trade on the other.
p315
aVBut one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data
p316
aVis the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization.
p317
aVIt's the societies like Sweden in the past,
p318
aVlike Canada today,
p319
aVwhere there is a centrist politics,
p320
aVwhere right and left work together,
p321
aVthat we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization.
p322
aVAnd what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization,
p323
aVa failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics,
p324
aVand a gap in terms of that liberal center ground
p325
aVthat can encourage communication and a shared understanding.
p326
aVWe might not achieve that today,
p327
aVbut at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media
p328
aVto drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VThese ideas are very tentative,
p333
aVand that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project.
p334
aa(lp335
VI am still British.
p336
aVI am still European.
p337
aVI am still a global citizen.
p338
aVFor those of us who believe
p339
aVthat our identities are not mutually exclusive,
p340
aVwe have to all work together
p341
aVto ensure that globalization takes everyone with us
p342
aVand doesn't leave people behind.
p343
aVOnly then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization.
p344
