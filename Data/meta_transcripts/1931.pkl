VI'm going to go off script
p4
aVand make Chris quite nervous here
p5
aVby making this audience participation.
p6
aVAll right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand
p9
aVif you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex.
p10
aVCould be the neighbors, hotel room,
p11
aVyour parents. Sorry.
p12
aVOkay. Pretty much everybody.
p13
aVNow raise your hand if the man was making
p14
aVmore noise than the woman.
p15
aVI see one guy there.
p16
aVIt doesn't count if it was you, sir.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVSo his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.
p19
aVSitting next to a loud guy.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow what does this tell us?
p22
aVIt tells us that human beings
p23
aVmake noise when they have sex,
p24
aVand it's generally the woman who makes more noise.
p25
aVThis is known as female copulatory vocalization
p26
aVto the clipboard crowd.
p27
aVI wasn't even going to mention this,
p28
aVbut somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,
p29
aVand she is the world's most famous
p30
aVfemale copulatory vocalizer.
p31
aVSo I thought, got to talk about that.
p32
aVWe'll get back to that a little bit later.
p33
aa(lp34
VLet me start by saying human beings
p35
aVare not descended from apes,
p36
aVdespite what you may have heard. We are apes.
p37
aVWe are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo
p38
aVthan the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,
p39
aVas Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books.
p40
aVWe're more closely related to chimps and bonobos
p41
aVthan chimps and bonobos are related
p42
aVto any other primate \u2014
p43
aVgorillas, orangutans, what have you.
p44
aVSo we're extremely closely related to them,
p45
aVand as you'll see in terms of our behavior,
p46
aVwe've got some relationship as well.
p47
aVSo what I'm asking today, the question
p48
aVI want to explore with you today is,
p49
aVwhat kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?
p50
aVNow, since Darwin's day there's been
p51
aVwhat Cacilda and I have called
p52
aVthe standard narrative of human sexual evolution,
p53
aVand you're all familiar with it,
p54
aVeven if you haven't read this stuff.
p55
aVThe idea is that, as part of human nature,
p56
aVfrom the beginning of our species' time,
p57
aVmen have sort of leased women's reproductive potential
p58
aVby providing them with certain goods and services.
p59
aVGenerally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,
p60
aVprotection, things like that.
p61
aVAnd in exchange, women have offered fidelity,
p62
aVor at least a promise of fidelity.
p63
aVNow this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship.
p64
aVThe war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to this vision. Right?
p65
aVWhat Cacilda and I have argued is that no,
p66
aVthis economic relationship,
p67
aVthis oppositional relationship,
p68
aVis actually an artifact of agriculture,
p69
aVwhich only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest.
p70
aVAnatomically modern human beings
p71
aVhave been around for about 200,000 years,
p72
aVso we're talking about five percent, at most,
p73
aVof our time as a modern, distinct species.
p74
aVSo before agriculture,
p75
aVbefore the agricultural revolution,
p76
aVit's important to understand that human beings
p77
aVlived in hunter-gatherer groups that are
p78
aVcharacterized wherever they're found in the world
p79
aVby what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.
p80
aVThey not only share things,
p81
aVthey demand that things be shared:
p82
aVmeat, shelter, protection, all these things
p83
aVthat were supposedly being traded to women
p84
aVfor their sexual fidelity, it turns out,
p85
aVare shared widely among these societies.
p86
aVNow I'm not saying that our ancestors
p87
aVwere noble savages, and I'm not saying
p88
aVmodern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either.
p89
aVWhat I'm saying is that this is simply
p90
aVthe best way to mitigate risk
p91
aVin a foraging context.
p92
aVAnd there's really no argument about this among anthropologists.
p93
aVAll Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality.
p94
aVSo we've argued that human sexuality
p95
aVhas essentially evolved, until agriculture,
p96
aVas a way of establishing and maintaining
p97
aVthe complex, flexible social systems, networks,
p98
aVthat our ancestors were very good at,
p99
aVand that's why our species has survived so well.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, this makes some people uncomfortable,
p102
aVand so I always need to take  a moment in these talks
p103
aVto say, listen,
p104
aVI'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,
p105
aVbut I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.
p106
aVThere were no strangers. Right?
p107
aVIn a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.
p108
aVYou've known these people your entire life.
p109
aVSo I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships,
p110
aVthat our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships
p111
aVgoing on at any given moment in their adult lives.
p112
aVBut I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.
p113
aVI'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with.
p114
aVAnd I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on.
p115
aVI'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd those of us who have chosen to be monogamous \u2014
p118
aVmy parents, for example, have been married
p119
aVfor 52 years monogamously,
p120
aVand if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,
p121
aVI don't want to hear about it\u2014
p122
aVI'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying
p123
aVthere's anything wrong with this.
p124
aVWhat I'm saying is that to argue
p125
aVthat our ancestors were sexual omnivores
p126
aVis no more a criticism of monogamy
p127
aVthan to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores
p128
aVis a criticism of vegetarianism.
p129
aVYou can choose to be a vegetarian,
p130
aVbut don't think that just because you've made that decision,
p131
aVbacon suddenly stops smelling good.
p132
aVOkay? So this is my point.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVThat one took a minute to sink in, huh?
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, in addition to being a great genius,
p137
aVa wonderful man, a wonderful husband,
p138
aVa wonderful father, Charles Darwin
p139
aVwas also a world-class Victorian prude.
p140
aVAll right? He was perplexed
p141
aVby the sexual swellings of certain primates,
p142
aVincluding chimps and bonobos,
p143
aVbecause these sexual swellings tend to provoke
p144
aVmany males to mate with the females.
p145
aVSo he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing
p146
aVif all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond, right?
p147
aVChimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,
p148
aVbut chimps and bonobos mate
p149
aVone to four times per hour
p150
aVwith up to a dozen males per day
p151
aVwhen they have their sexual swellings.
p152
aVInterestingly, chimps have sexual swellings
p153
aVthrough 40 percent, roughly,
p154
aVof their menstrual cycle,
p155
aVbonobos 90 percent,
p156
aVand humans are among the only species on the planet
p157
aVwhere the female is available for sex
p158
aVthroughout the menstrual cycle,
p159
aVwhether she's menstruating, whether she's post-menopausal,
p160
aVwhether she's already pregnant.
p161
aVThis is vanishingly rare among mammals.
p162
aVSo it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.
p163
aVNow, Darwin ignored the reflections
p164
aVof the sexual swelling in his own day,
p165
aVas scientists tend to do sometimes.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo what we're talking about is sperm competition.
p168
aVNow the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells,
p169
aVso it's already a competitive environment.
p170
aVThe question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm
p171
aVor just their own.
p172
aVThere's a lot to talk about in this chart.
p173
aVThe one thing I'll call your attention to right away
p174
aVis the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human.
p175
aVThat indicates female copulatory vocalization.
p176
aVJust look at the numbers.
p177
aVThe average human has sex
p178
aVabout 1,000 times per birth.
p179
aVIf that number seems high for some of you,
p180
aVI assure you it seems low for others in the room.
p181
aVWe share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.
p182
aVWe don't share it with the other three apes,
p183
aVthe gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,
p184
aVwho are more typical of mammals,
p185
aVhaving sex only about a dozen times per birth.
p186
aVHumans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face-to-face
p187
aVwhen both of them are alive.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVAnd you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo
p190
aVall have external testicles, which in our book
p191
aVwe equate to a special fridge you have in the garage
p192
aVjust for beer.
p193
aVIf you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge
p194
aVin the garage, you expect a party to happen
p195
aVat any moment, and you need to be ready.
p196
aVThat's what the external testicles are.
p197
aVThey keep the sperm cells cool
p198
aVso you can have frequent ejaculations.
p199
aVI'm sorry. It's true.
p200
aVThe human, some of you will be happy to hear,
p201
aVhas the largest, thickest penis of any primate.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.
p204
aVIt goes into anthropology as well.
p205
aVHistorical records are full of accounts of people
p206
aVaround the world who have sexual practices
p207
aVthat should be impossible
p208
aVgiven what we have assumed about human sexual evolution.
p209
aVThese women are the Mosuo from southwestern China.
p210
aVIn their society, everyone, men and women,
p211
aVare completely sexually autonomous.
p212
aVThere's no shame associated with sexual behavior.
p213
aVWomen have hundreds of partners.
p214
aVIt doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.
p215
aVWhen the woman becomes pregnant,
p216
aVthe child is cared for by her,  her sisters, and her brothers.
p217
aVThe biological father is a nonissue.
p218
aVOn the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,
p219
aVwe've got many tribes which practice
p220
aVwhat anthropologists call partible paternity.
p221
aVThese people actually believe \u2014
p222
aVand they have no contact among them,
p223
aVno common language or anything,
p224
aVso it's not an idea that spread,
p225
aVit's an idea that's arisen around the world \u2014
p226
aVthey believe that a fetus is literally made
p227
aVof accumulated semen.
p228
aVSo a woman who wants to have a child
p229
aVwho's smart and funny and strong
p230
aVmakes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,
p231
aVthe funny guy and the strong guy,
p232
aVto get the essence of each of these men into the baby,
p233
aVand then when the child is born,
p234
aVthese different men will come forward
p235
aVand acknowledge their paternity of the child.
p236
aVSo paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor
p237
aVin this society.
p238
aVSo there are all sorts of examples like this
p239
aVthat we go through in the book.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, why does this matter?
p242
aVEdward Wilson says we need to understand
p243
aVthat human sexuality is first a bonding device
p244
aVand only secondarily procreation.
p245
aVI think that's true. This matters because
p246
aVour evolved sexuality is in direct conflict
p247
aVwith many aspects of the modern world.
p248
aVThe contradictions between what we're told
p249
aVwe should feel and what we actually do feel
p250
aVgenerates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.
p251
aVMy hope is that a more accurate,
p252
aVupdated understanding of human sexuality
p253
aVwill lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,
p254
aVfor each other,
p255
aVgreater respect for unconventional relationship configurations
p256
aVlike same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,
p257
aVand that we'll finally put to rest the idea
p258
aVthat men have some innate, instinctive right
p259
aVto monitor and control women's sexual behavior.
p260
aV(Applause)
p261
aVThank you.
p262
aVAnd we'll see that it's not only gay people
p263
aVthat have to come out of the closet.
p264
aVWe all have closets we have to come out of. Right?
p265
aVAnd when we do come out of those closets,
p266
aVwe'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,
p267
aVour fight is with an outdated,  Victorian sense of human sexuality
p268
aVthat conflates desire with property rights,
p269
aVgenerates shame and confusion
p270
aVin place of understanding and empathy.
p271
aVIt's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,
p272
aVbecause the truth is
p273
aVthat men are from Africa
p274
aVand women are from Africa.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Christopher Ryan: Thank you.
p281
aa(lp282
VCA: So a question.
p283
aVIt's so perplexing, trying to use arguments
p284
aVabout evolutionary history
p285
aVto turn that into what we ought to do today.
p286
aVSomeone could give a talk and say,
p287
aVlook at us, we've got these really sharp teeth
p288
aVand muscles and a brain that's really good
p289
aVat throwing weapons,
p290
aVand if you look at lots of societies around the world,
p291
aVyou'll see very high rates of violence.
p292
aVNonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,
p293
aVbut it's not who you are.
p294
aVHow is that different
p295
aVfrom the talk you gave?
p296
aa(lp297
VCR: Well first of all, the evidence
p298
aVfor high levels of violence in prehistory
p299
aVis very debatable.
p300
aVBut that's just an example.
p301
aVCertainly, you know, lots of people say to me,
p302
aVjust because we lived a certain way in the past
p303
aVdoesn't mean we should live that  way now, and I agree with that.
p304
aVEveryone has to respond to the modern world.
p305
aVBut the body does have its inherent
p306
aVevolved trajectories.
p307
aVAnd so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes,
p308
aVbut your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites.
p309
aVI think it was Schopenhauer who said,
p310
aVa person can do what they want
p311
aVbut not want what they want.
p312
aVAnd so what I'm arguing against
p313
aVis the shame that's associated with desires.
p314
aVIt's the idea that if you love your husband or wife
p315
aVbut you still are attracted to other people,
p316
aVthere's something wrong with you,
p317
aVthere's something wrong with your marriage,
p318
aVsomething wrong with your partner.
p319
aVI think a lot of families are fractured
p320
aVby unrealistic expectations
p321
aVthat are based upon this false vision of human sexuality.
p322
aVThat's what I'm trying to get at.
p323
aa(lp324
