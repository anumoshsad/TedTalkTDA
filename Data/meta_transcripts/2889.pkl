p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VRun now.
p13
aa(lp14
VThat's the voice of my anxiety talking.
p15
aVEven when there's absolutely nothing wrong,
p16
aVI sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom,
p17
aVlike danger is lurking just around the corner.
p18
aa(lp19
VYou see, a few years ago,
p20
aVI was diagnosed with generalized anxiety
p21
aVand depression \u2014
p22
aVtwo conditions that often go hand in hand.
p23
aVNow, there was a time I wouldn't have told anybody,
p24
aVespecially not in front of a big audience.
p25
aVAs a black woman,
p26
aVI've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed.
p27
aVAnd like most people in my community,
p28
aVI had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness,
p29
aVa character flaw.
p30
aVBut I wasn't weak;
p31
aVI was a high achiever.
p32
aVI'd earned a Master's degree in Media Studies
p33
aVand had a string of high-profile jobs in the film and television industries.
p34
aVI'd even won two Emmy Awards for my hard work.
p35
aVSure, I was totally spent,
p36
aVI lacked interest in things I used to enjoy,
p37
aVbarely ate,
p38
aVstruggled with insomnia
p39
aVand felt isolated and depleted.
p40
aVBut depressed?
p41
aVNo, not me.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt took weeks before I could admit it,
p44
aVbut the doctor was right:
p45
aVI was depressed.
p46
aVStill, I didn't tell anybody about my diagnosis.
p47
aVI was too ashamed.
p48
aVI didn't think I had the right to be depressed.
p49
aVI had a privileged life
p50
aVwith a loving family and a successful career.
p51
aVAnd when I thought about the unspeakable horrors
p52
aVthat my ancestors had been through in this country
p53
aVso that I could have it better,
p54
aVmy shame grew even deeper.
p55
aVI was standing on their shoulders.
p56
aVHow could I let them down?
p57
aVI would hold my head up,
p58
aVput a smile on my face
p59
aVand never tell a soul.
p60
aa(lp61
VOn July 4, 2013,
p62
aVmy world came crashing in on me.
p63
aVThat was the day I got a phone call from my mom
p64
aVtelling me that my 22-year-old nephew, Paul, had ended his life,
p65
aVafter years of battling depression and anxiety.
p66
aVThere are no words that can describe the devastation I felt.
p67
aVPaul and I were very close,
p68
aVbut I had no idea he was in so much pain.
p69
aVNeither one of us had ever talked to the other about our struggles.
p70
aVThe shame and stigma kept us both silent.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, my way of dealing with adversity is to face it head on,
p73
aVso I spent the next two years researching depression and anxiety,
p74
aVand what I found was mind-blowing.
p75
aVThe World Health Organization reports
p76
aVthat depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability
p77
aVin the world.
p78
aVWhile the exact cause of depression isn't clear,
p79
aVresearch suggests that most mental disorders develop,
p80
aVat least in part,
p81
aVbecause of a chemical imbalance in the brain,
p82
aVand/or an underlying genetic predisposition.
p83
aVSo you can't just shake it off.
p84
aa(lp85
VFor black Americans,
p86
aVstressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities
p87
aVput them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder,
p88
aVyet they seek mental health services
p89
aVat about half the rate of white Americans.
p90
aVOne reason is the stigma,
p91
aVwith 63 percent of black Americans mistaking depression for a weakness.
p92
aVSadly, the suicide rate among black children
p93
aVhas doubled in the past 20 years.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, here's the good news:
p96
aVseventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve
p97
aVwith therapy, treatment and medication.
p98
aVArmed with this information,
p99
aVI made a decision:
p100
aVI wasn't going to be silent anymore.
p101
aVWith my family's blessing,
p102
aVI would share our story
p103
aVin hopes of sparking a national conversation.
p104
aa(lp105
VA friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,
p106
aV"Being strong is killing us."
p107
aVShe's right.
p108
aVWe have got to retire those tired, old narratives
p109
aVof the strong black woman
p110
aVand the super-masculine black man,
p111
aVwho, no matter how many times they get knocked down,
p112
aVjust shake it off and soldier on.
p113
aVHaving feelings isn't a sign of weakness.
p114
aVFeelings mean we're human.
p115
aVAnd when we deny our humanity,
p116
aVit leaves us feeling empty inside,
p117
aVsearching for ways to self-medicate in order to fill the void.
p118
aVMy drug was high achievement.
p119
aa(lp120
VThese days, I share my story openly,
p121
aVand I ask others to share theirs, too.
p122
aVI believe that's what it takes
p123
aVto help people who may be suffering in silence
p124
aVto know that they are not alone
p125
aVand to know that with help,
p126
aVthey can heal.
p127
aVNow, I still have my struggles,
p128
aVparticularly with the anxiety,
p129
aVbut I'm able to manage it
p130
aVthrough daily mediation, yoga and a relatively healthy diet.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VIf I feel like things are starting to spiral,
p135
aVI make an appointment to see my therapist,
p136
aVa dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong,
p137
aVwho has a great sense of humor
p138
aVand a familiarity that I find comforting.
p139
aVI will always regret
p140
aVthat I couldn't be there for my nephew.
p141
aVBut my sincerest hope
p142
aVis that I can inspire others with the lesson that I've learned.
p143
aa(lp144
VLife is beautiful.
p145
aVSometimes it's messy,
p146
aVand it's always unpredictable.
p147
aVBut it will all be OK
p148
aVwhen you have your support system to help you through it.
p149
aVI hope that if your burden gets too heavy,
p150
aVyou'll ask for a hand, too.
p151
aa(lp152
VThank you.
