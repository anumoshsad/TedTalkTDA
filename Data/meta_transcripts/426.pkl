VI'll just start talking about the 17th century.
p4
aVI hope nobody finds that offensive.
p5
aVI \u2014 you know, when I \u2014 after I had invented PCR,
p6
aVI kind of needed a change.
p7
aVAnd I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf.
p8
aVAnd I started living down there on the beach for a long time.
p9
aVAnd when surfers are out waiting
p10
aVfor waves,
p11
aVyou probably wonder, if you've never been out there, what are they doing?
p12
aVYou know, sometimes there's a 10-, 15-minute break out there
p13
aVwhen you're waiting for a wave to come in.
p14
aVThey usually talk about the 17th century.
p15
aVYou know, they get a real bad rap in the world.
p16
aVPeople think they're sort of lowbrows.
p17
aVOne day, somebody suggested I read this book.
p18
aVIt was called \u2014
p19
aVit was called "The Air Pump,"
p20
aVor something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."
p21
aVIt was a real weird book about the 17th century.
p22
aVAnd I realized, the roots
p23
aVof the way I sort of thought
p24
aVwas just the only natural way to think about things.
p25
aVThat \u2014 you know, I was born thinking about things that way,
p26
aVand I had always been like a little scientist guy.
p27
aVAnd when I went to find out something,
p28
aVI used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised,
p29
aVyou know, when they first told me how \u2014
p30
aVhow you were supposed to do science,
p31
aVbecause I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever.
p32
aVBut it didn't \u2014 it never occurred to me
p33
aVthat it had to be invented
p34
aVand that it had been invented
p35
aVonly 350 years ago.
p36
aVYou know, it was \u2014
p37
aVlike it happened in England, and Germany, and Italy
p38
aVsort of all at the same time.
p39
aVAnd the story of that,
p40
aVI thought, was really fascinating.
p41
aVSo I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
p42
aVand what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do.
p43
aVAnd it's, it's a kind of \u2014
p44
aVYou know, Charles I got beheaded
p45
aVsomewhere early in the 17th century.
p46
aVAnd the English set up Cromwell
p47
aVand a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever,
p48
aVand not the kind of Republicans we had.
p49
aVThey changed the government, and it didn't work.
p50
aVAnd
p51
aVCharles II, the son,
p52
aVwas finally put back on the throne of England.
p53
aVHe was really nervous, because his dad had been,
p54
aVyou know, beheaded for being the King of England
p55
aVAnd he was nervous about the fact
p56
aVthat conversations that got going
p57
aVin, like, bars and stuff
p58
aVwould turn to \u2014
p59
aVthis is kind of \u2014 it's hard to believe,
p60
aVbut people in the 17th century in England
p61
aVwere starting to talk about, you know,
p62
aVphilosophy and stuff in bars.
p63
aVThey didn't have TV screens,
p64
aVand they didn't have any football games to watch.
p65
aVAnd they would get really pissy,
p66
aVand all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight
p67
aVabout issues like whether or not
p68
aVit was okay if Robert Boyle
p69
aVmade a device called the vacuum pump.
p70
aVNow, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.
p71
aVHe was a Christian guy during the weekends,
p72
aVbut during the week he was a scientist.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVWhich was \u2014 back then it was
p75
aVsort of, you know, well, you know \u2014
p76
aVif you made this thing \u2014 he made this little device,
p77
aVlike kind of like a bicycle pump
p78
aVin reverse that could suck all the air out of \u2014
p79
aVyou know what a bell jar is? One of these things,
p80
aVyou pick it up, put it down, and it's got a seal,
p81
aVand you can see inside of it,
p82
aVso you can see what's going on inside this thing.
p83
aVBut what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there,
p84
aVand see what would happen inside there.
p85
aVI mean, the first \u2014 I think one of the first experiments he did
p86
aVwas he put a bird in there.
p87
aVAnd people in the 17th century,
p88
aVthey didn't really understand the same way we do
p89
aVabout you know, this stuff is
p90
aVa bunch of different kinds of molecules,
p91
aVand we breathe it in for a purpose and all that.
p92
aVI mean, fish don't know much about water,
p93
aVand people didn't know much about air.
p94
aVBut both started exploring it.
p95
aVOne thing, he put a bird in there, and he pumped all the air out,
p96
aVand the bird died. So he said, hmm...
p97
aVHe said \u2014 he called what he'd done as making \u2014
p98
aVthey didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time.
p99
aVNow you call it a vacuum pump; he called it a vacuum.
p100
aVRight? And immediately,
p101
aVhe got into trouble with the local clergy
p102
aVwho said, you can't make a vacuum.
p103
aVAh, uh \u2014
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAristotle said that nature abhors one.
p106
aVI think it was a poor translation, probably,
p107
aVbut people relied on authorities like that.
p108
aVAnd you know, Boyle says, well, shit.
p109
aVI make them all the time.
p110
aVI mean, whatever that is that kills the bird \u2014
p111
aVand I'm calling it a vacuum.
p112
aVAnd the religious people said that
p113
aVif God wanted you to make \u2014
p114
aVI mean, God is everywhere,
p115
aVthat was one of their rules, is God is everywhere.
p116
aVAnd a vacuum \u2014 there's nothing in a vacuum,
p117
aVso you've \u2014 God couldn't be in there.
p118
aVSo therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum, you know.
p119
aVAnd Boyle said, bullshit.
p120
aVI mean, you want to call it Godless,
p121
aVyou know, you call it Godless.
p122
aVBut that's not my job. I'm not into that.
p123
aVI do that on the weekend. And like \u2014
p124
aVwhat I'm trying to do is figure out what happens
p125
aVwhen you suck everything out of a compartment.
p126
aVAnd he did all these cute little experiments.
p127
aVLike he did one with \u2014 he had a little wheel,
p128
aVlike a fan, that was
p129
aVsort of loosely attached, so it could spin by itself.
p130
aVHe had another fan opposed to it
p131
aVthat he had like a \u2014
p132
aVI mean, the way I would have done this would be, like, a rubber band,
p133
aVand, you know, around a tinker toy kind of fan.
p134
aVI know exactly how he did it; I've seen the drawings.
p135
aVIt's two fans, one which he could turn from outside
p136
aVafter he got the vacuum established,
p137
aVand he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it,
p138
aVthe one fan would no longer turn the other one, right?
p139
aVSomething was missing, you know. I mean, these are \u2014
p140
aVit's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that,
p141
aVbut that was what was going on at the time.
p142
aVAnd like, there was big arguments about it
p143
aVin the \u2014 you know, the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff.
p144
aVAnd Charles
p145
aVstarted not liking that.
p146
aVCharles II was kind of saying, you know, you should keep that \u2014
p147
aVlet's make a place where you can do this stuff
p148
aVwhere people don't get so \u2014 you know,
p149
aVwe don't want the \u2014 we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so \u2014
p150
aVbecause when they started talking about religion
p151
aVand science and stuff like that,
p152
aVthat's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble.
p153
aVAnd so,
p154
aVCharles said, I'm going to put up the money
p155
aVgive you guys a building,
p156
aVcome here and you can meet in the building,
p157
aVbut just don't talk about religion in there.
p158
aVAnd that was fine with Boyle.
p159
aVHe said, OK, we're going to start having these meetings.
p160
aVAnd anybody who wants to do science is \u2014
p161
aVthis is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out
p162
aVa lot of really interesting things.
p163
aVAnd there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society,
p164
aVthey called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well.
p165
aVIt wasn't like a TED conference.
p166
aVThat was the only criteria, was that you be \u2014
p167
aVyou looked like a gentleman, and they'd let anybody could come.
p168
aVYou didn't have to be a member then.
p169
aVAnd so, they would come in and you would do \u2014
p170
aVAnybody that was going to show an experiment,
p171
aVwhich was kind of a new word at the time,
p172
aVdemonstrate some principle,
p173
aVthey had to do it on stage, where everybody could see it.
p174
aVSo they were \u2014
p175
aVthe really important part of this was,
p176
aVyou were not supposed to talk
p177
aVabout final causes, for instance.
p178
aVAnd God was out of the picture.
p179
aVThe actual nature of reality was not at issue.
p180
aVYou're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything.
p181
aVYou were not supposed to talk about anything
p182
aVthat you couldn't demonstrate.
p183
aVSo if somebody could see it, you could say, here's how the machine works,
p184
aVhere's what we do, and then here's what happens.
p185
aVAnd seeing what happens, it was OK
p186
aVto generalize,
p187
aVand say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime
p188
aVwe make one of these things.
p189
aVAnd so you can start making up some rules.
p190
aVYou say, anytime you have a vacuum state,
p191
aVyou will discover that one wheel will not turn another one,
p192
aVif the only connection between them
p193
aVis whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing.
p194
aVCandles can't burn in a vacuum,
p195
aVtherefore, probably sparklers wouldn't either.
p196
aVIt's not clear; actually sparklers will,
p197
aVbut they didn't know that.
p198
aVThey didn't have sparklers. But, they \u2014
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aV\u2014 you can make up rules, but they have to relate
p201
aVonly to the things that you've been able to demonstrate.
p202
aVAnd most the demonstrations had to do with visuals.
p203
aVLike if you do an experiment on stage,
p204
aVand nobody can see it, they can just hear it, they would probably think you were freaky.
p205
aVI mean, reality is what you can see.
p206
aVThat wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting,
p207
aVbut I'm sure that was part of it, you know. If people hear voices,
p208
aVand they can't see and associate it with somebody,
p209
aVthat person's probably not there.
p210
aVBut the general idea that you could only \u2014
p211
aVyou could only really talk about things in that place
p212
aVthat had some kind of experimental basis.
p213
aVIt didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,
p214
aVwho was a local philosopher,
p215
aVsaid about it, you know,
p216
aVbecause you weren't going to be talking final causes.
p217
aVWhat's happening here,
p218
aVin the middle of the 17th century,
p219
aVwas that what became my field \u2014
p220
aVscience, experimental science \u2014
p221
aVwas pulling itself away,
p222
aVand it was in a physical way, because we're going to do it in this room over here,
p223
aVbut it was also what \u2014 it was an amazing thing that happened.
p224
aVScience had been all interlocked
p225
aVwith theology, and philosophy,
p226
aVand \u2014 and \u2014 and mathematics,
p227
aVwhich is really not science.
p228
aVBut experimental science had been tied up with all those things.
p229
aVAnd the mathematics part
p230
aVand the experimental science part
p231
aVwas pulling away from philosophy.
p232
aVAnd \u2014 things \u2014
p233
aVwe never looked back.
p234
aVIt's been so cool since then.
p235
aVI mean, it just \u2014 it just \u2014 untangled a thing that was really impeding
p236
aVtechnology from being developed.
p237
aVAnd, I mean, everybody in this room \u2014
p238
aVnow, this is 350 short years ago.
p239
aVRemember, that's a short time.
p240
aVIt was 300,000, probably, years ago
p241
aVthat most of us, the ancestors of most of us in this room
p242
aVcame up out of Africa and turned to the left.
p243
aVYou know, the ones that turned to the right, there are some of those
p244
aVin the Japanese translation.
p245
aVBut that happened very \u2014 a long time ago
p246
aVcompared to
p247
aV350 short years ago.
p248
aVBut in that 350 years,
p249
aVthe place has just undergone a lot of changes.
p250
aVIn fact, everybody in this room probably,
p251
aVespecially if you picked up your bag \u2014
p252
aVsome of you, I know, didn't pick up your bags \u2014
p253
aVbut if you picked up your bag, everybody in this room
p254
aVhas got in their pocket, or back in their room,
p255
aVsomething
p256
aVthat 350 years ago,
p257
aVkings would have gone to war to have.
p258
aVI mean, if you can think how important \u2014
p259
aVIf you have a GPS system and there are no satellites,
p260
aVit's not going to be much use. But, like \u2014
p261
aVbut, you know, if somebody had a GPS system
p262
aVin the 17th century
p263
aVsome king would have gotten together an army
p264
aVand gone to get it, you know. If that person \u2014
p265
aVAudience: For the teddy bear? The teddy bear?
p266
aVKary Mullis: They might have done it for the teddy bear, yeah.
p267
aVBut \u2014 all of us own stuff.
p268
aVI mean, individuals own things
p269
aVthat kings would have definitely gone to war to get.
p270
aVAnd this is just 350 years.
p271
aVNot a whole lot of people doing this stuff.
p272
aVYou know, the important people \u2014
p273
aVyou can almost read about their lives,
p274
aVabout all the really important people that made advances, you know.
p275
aVAnd, I mean \u2014
p276
aVthis kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff
p277
aVcame from that separation
p278
aVof this little sort of thing that we do \u2014
p279
aVnow I, when I was a boy
p280
aVwas born sort of with this idea
p281
aVthat if you want to know something \u2014
p282
aVyou know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot,
p283
aVand my mother didn't really know much science,
p284
aVbut I thought if you want to know something about stuff,
p285
aVyou do it \u2014 you make an experiment, you know.
p286
aVYou get \u2014 you get, like \u2014
p287
aVI just had a natural feeling for science
p288
aVand setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought.
p289
aVI thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way.
p290
aVIt isn't true. I mean, there's a lot of people \u2014
p291
aVYou know, I was one of those scientists that was \u2014
p292
aVgot into trouble the other night at dinner
p293
aVbecause of the post-modernism thing.
p294
aVAnd I didn't mean, you know \u2014 where is that lady?
p295
aVAudience: Here.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVKM: I mean, I didn't really think of that as an argument
p298
aVso much as just a lively discussion.
p299
aVI didn't take it personally, but \u2014
p300
aVI just \u2014 I had \u2014 I naively had thought,
p301
aVuntil this surfing experience started me into the 17th century,
p302
aVI'd thought that's just the way people thought,
p303
aVand everybody did, and they recognized reality
p304
aVby what they could see or touch or feel or hear.
p305
aVAt any rate, when I was a boy,
p306
aVI, like, for instance, I had this \u2014
p307
aVI got this little book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma \u2014
p308
aVThis is about the time that George Dyson's dad
p309
aVwas starting to blow nuclear \u2014
p310
aVthinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff.
p311
aVI was thinking about making my own little rockets.
p312
aVAnd I knew that frogs \u2014 little frogs \u2014
p313
aVhad aspirations of space travel,
p314
aVjust like people. And I \u2014
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aVI was looking for a \u2014
p317
aVa propulsion system
p318
aVthat would like, make a rocket, like,
p319
aVmaybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles.
p320
aVAnd, I mean, that was my sort of goal.
p321
aVI wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute
p322
aVto come back with the frog in it.
p323
aVAnd \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014
p324
aVI got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
p325
aVwhere there's a missile base.
p326
aVThey send it out for amateur rocketeers,
p327
aVand
p328
aVit said in there
p329
aVdo not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVYou know,
p332
aVthat's what you call a lead.
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVYou sort of \u2014 now you say, well, let's see if I can
p335
aVget hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,
p336
aVand heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do,
p337
aVand what it is going to \u2014 and how is it going to work.
p338
aVAnd we didn't have \u2014
p339
aVlike, my mother
p340
aVpresided over the back yard
p341
aVfrom an upstairs window,
p342
aVwhere she would be ironing or something like that.
p343
aVAnd she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on,
p344
aVand if there was any puffs of smoke out there,
p345
aVshe'd lean out and admonish us all
p346
aVnot to blow our eyes out. That was her \u2014
p347
aVYou know, that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.
p348
aVThat's why I thought, as long as I don't blow my eyes out...
p349
aVI may not care about the fact
p350
aVthat it's prohibited from heating this solution.
p351
aVI'm going to do it carefully, but I'll do it.
p352
aVIt's like anything else that's prohibited:
p353
aVyou do it behind the garage.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVSo, I went to the drug store
p356
aVand I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate
p357
aVand it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid
p358
aVto walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
p359
aVNowadays, it's no ma'am,
p360
aVcheck your shoes. And like \u2014
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aVBut then it wasn't \u2014 they didn't have any, but the guy had \u2014
p363
aVI said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know.
p364
aVAnd he had potassium nitrate.
p365
aVAnd I said, that might do the same thing, whatever it is.
p366
aVI'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual.
p367
aVAnd so I \u2014 I did some experiments.
p368
aVYou know, I started off with little tiny amounts
p369
aVof potassium nitrate and sugar,
p370
aVwhich was readily available,
p371
aVand I mixed it in different proportions,
p372
aVand I tried to light it on fire.
p373
aVJust to see what would happen, if you mixed it together.
p374
aVAnd it \u2014 they burned.
p375
aVIt burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell,
p376
aVcompared to other rocket fuels I had tried,
p377
aVthat all had sulfur in them.
p378
aVAnd, it smelt like burnt candy.
p379
aVAnd then I tried the melting business, and I melted it.
p380
aVAnd then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid, brown.
p381
aVAnd then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance,
p382
aVthat when you lit that,
p383
aVit went off like a bat.
p384
aVI mean, the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down \u2014
p385
aVyou'd light it, and it would just start dancing around the yard.
p386
aVAnd I said, there
p387
aVis a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go.
p388
aV(Laughter)
p389
aVSo I started developing \u2014
p390
aVyou know, George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother.
p391
aVBut I \u2014 it took me about \u2014 it took me about,
p392
aVI'd say, six months
p393
aVto finally figure out all the little things.
p394
aVThere's a lot of little things involved
p395
aVin making a rocket that it will actually work,
p396
aVeven after you have the fuel.
p397
aVBut you do it, by \u2014 what I just\u2014
p398
aVyou know, you do experiments,
p399
aVand you write down things sometimes,
p400
aVyou make observations, you know.
p401
aVAnd then you slowly build up a theory
p402
aVof how this stuff works.
p403
aVAnd it was \u2014 I was following all the rules.
p404
aVI didn't know what the rules were,
p405
aVI'm a natural born scientist, I guess,
p406
aVor some kind of a throwback to the 17th century, whatever.
p407
aVBut at any rate, we finally did
p408
aVhave a device that would reproduceably
p409
aVput a frog out of sight
p410
aVand get him back alive.
p411
aVAnd we had not \u2014
p412
aVI mean, we weren't frightened by it.
p413
aVWe should have been, because it made a lot of smoke
p414
aVand it made a lot of noise,
p415
aVand it was powerful, you know.
p416
aVAnd once in a while, they would blow up.
p417
aVBut I wasn't worried, by the way,
p418
aVabout, you know,
p419
aVthe explosion causing the destruction of the planet.
p420
aVI hadn't heard about the 10 ways
p421
aVthat we should be afraid of the \u2014
p422
aVBy the way,
p423
aVI could have thought,
p424
aVI'd better not do this because
p425
aVthey say not to, you know.
p426
aVAnd I'd better get permission from the government.
p427
aVIf I'd have waited around for that,
p428
aVI would have never \u2014 the frog would have died, you know.
p429
aVAt any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story,
p430
aVand he said, tell personal things, you know, and that's a personal \u2014
p431
aVI was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife,
p432
aVbut that would be too personal, wouldn't it.
p433
aVSo, so I've got something else that's not personal.
p434
aVBut that... process is what I think of as science,
p435
aVsee, where you start with some idea,
p436
aVand then instead of, like, looking up,
p437
aVevery authority that you've ever heard of
p438
aVI \u2014 sometimes you do that,
p439
aVif you're going to write a paper later,
p440
aVyou want to figure out who else has worked on it.
p441
aVBut in the actual process, you get an idea \u2014
p442
aVlike, when I got the idea one night
p443
aVthat I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides,
p444
aVand I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA,
p445
aVyou know, the thinking for that
p446
aVwas about 20 minutes while I was driving my car,
p447
aVand then instead of going \u2014 I went back and I did talk to people about it,
p448
aVbut if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists \u2014
p449
aVI would have abandoned it.
p450
aVYou know, if I had gone back looking for an authority figure
p451
aVwho could tell me if it would work or not,
p452
aVhe would have said, no, it probably won't.
p453
aVBecause the results of it were so spectacular
p454
aVthat if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
p455
aVNobody wants a chemist to come in
p456
aVand poke around in their stuff like that and change things.
p457
aVBut if you go to authority, and you always don't \u2014
p458
aVyou don't always get the right answer, see.
p459
aVBut I knew, you'd go into the lab
p460
aVand you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority,
p461
aVand you can say, I know it works,
p462
aVbecause right there in that tube
p463
aVis where it happened,
p464
aVand here, on this gel, there's a little band there
p465
aVthat I know that's DNA, and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,
p466
aVso there! So it does work.
p467
aVYou know, that's how you do science.
p468
aVAnd then you say, well, what can make it work better?
p469
aVAnd then you figure out better and better ways to do it.
p470
aVBut you always work from, from like, facts
p471
aVthat you have made available to you
p472
aVby doing experiments: things that you could do on a stage.
p473
aVAnd no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all \u2014
p474
aVyou've got to be very honest
p475
aVwith what you're doing if it really is going to work.
p476
aVI mean, you can't make up results,
p477
aVand then do another experiment based on that one.
p478
aVSo you have to be honest.
p479
aVAnd I'm basically honest.
p480
aVI have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble,
p481
aVif I, like \u2014 so I've just sort of been naturally honest
p482
aVand naturally inquisitive,
p483
aVand that sort of leads to that kind of science.
p484
aVNow, let's see...
p485
aVI've got another five minutes, right?
p486
aVOK. All scientists aren't like that.
p487
aVYou know \u2014 and there is a lot \u2014
p488
aV(Laughter)
p489
aVThere is a lot \u2014 a lot has been going on since
p490
aVIsaac Newton and all that stuff happened.
p491
aVOne of the things that happened right around World War II
p492
aVin that same time period before,
p493
aVand as sure as hell afterwards,
p494
aVgovernment got \u2014 realized that scientists aren't strange dudes
p495
aVthat, you know, hide in ivory towers
p496
aVand do ridiculous things with test tube.
p497
aVScientists, you know, made World War II
p498
aVas we know it quite possible.
p499
aVThey made faster things.
p500
aVThey made bigger guns to shoot them down with.
p501
aVYou know, they made drugs to give the pilots
p502
aVif they were broken up in the process.
p503
aVThey made all kinds of \u2014 and then finally one giant bomb
p504
aVto end the whole thing, right?
p505
aVAnd everybody stepped back a little and said, you know,
p506
aVwe ought to invest in this shit,
p507
aVbecause whoever has got the most of these people
p508
aVworking in the places is going to have a dominant position,
p509
aVat least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.
p510
aVAnd they got involved in it, and the scientific
p511
aVand industrial establishment was born,
p512
aVand out of that came a lot of scientists
p513
aVwho were in there for the money, you know,
p514
aVbecause it was suddenly available.
p515
aVAnd they weren't the curious little boys
p516
aVthat liked to put frogs up in the air.
p517
aVThey were the same people that later went in to medical school, you know,
p518
aVbecause there was money in it, you know. I mean, later, then they all got into business \u2014
p519
aVI mean, there are waves of \u2014 going into your high school,
p520
aVperson saying, you want to be rich, you know, be a scientist. You know, not anymore.
p521
aVYou want to be rich, you be a businessman.
p522
aVBut a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel.
p523
aVThat's back when travel was easy.
p524
aVAnd those people don't think \u2014
p525
aVthey don't \u2014
p526
aVthey don't always tell you the truth, you know.
p527
aVThere is nothing in their contract, in fact,
p528
aVthat makes it to their advantage always,
p529
aVto tell you the truth.
p530
aVAnd the people I'm talking about are people that like \u2014
p531
aVthey say that they're a member of the committee
p532
aVcalled, say, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.
p533
aVAnd they \u2014 and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out
p534
aVhow we're going to \u2014 how we're going to continually prove
p535
aVthat the planet is getting warmer,
p536
aVwhen that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.
p537
aVI mean, if you actually measure
p538
aVthe temperature over a period \u2014
p539
aVI mean, the temperature has been measured now
p540
aVpretty carefully for about 50, 60 years \u2014
p541
aVlonger than that it's been measured,
p542
aVbut in really nice, precise ways,
p543
aVand records have been kept for 50 or 60 years,
p544
aVand in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.
p545
aVIt's like, the average temperature
p546
aVhas gone up a tiny little bit,
p547
aVbecause the nighttime temperatures
p548
aVat the weather stations have come up just a little bit.
p549
aVBut there's a good explanation for that.
p550
aVAnd it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town,
p551
aVwhere the airport was, and now
p552
aVthe town's moved out there, there's concrete all around
p553
aVand they call it the skyline effect.
p554
aVAnd most responsible people
p555
aVthat measure temperatures realize
p556
aVyou have to shield your measuring device from that.
p557
aVAnd even then, you know,
p558
aVbecause the buildings get warm in the daytime,
p559
aVand they keep it a little warmer at night.
p560
aVSo the temperature has been, sort of, inching up.
p561
aVIt should have been. But not a lot. Not like, you know \u2014
p562
aVthe first guy \u2014 the first guy that got the idea
p563
aVthat we're going to fry ourselves here,
p564
aVactually, he didn't think of it that way.
p565
aVHis name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish, and he said,
p566
aVif you double the CO2 level in the atmosphere,
p567
aVwhich he thought might \u2014 this is in 1900 \u2014
p568
aVthe temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.
p569
aVHe was thinking of the earth as, kind of like,
p570
aVyou know, like a completely insulated thing
p571
aVwith no stuff in it, really,
p572
aVjust energy coming down, energy leaving.
p573
aVAnd so he came up with this theory,
p574
aVand he said, this will be cool,
p575
aVbecause it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden,
p576
aVyou know, and the surfers liked it,
p577
aVthe surfers thought, that's a cool idea,
p578
aVbecause it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and \u2014
p579
aVbut a lot of other people later on
p580
aVstarted thinking it would be bad, you know.
p581
aVBut nobody actually demonstrated it, right?
p582
aVI mean, the temperature as measured \u2014
p583
aVand you can find this on our wonderful Internet,
p584
aVyou just go and look for all NASAs records,
p585
aVand all the Weather Bureau's records,
p586
aVand you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just \u2014
p587
aVthe nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet
p588
aVhas gone up a tiny little bit.
p589
aVSo if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up
p590
aVabout .7 degrees in this century.
p591
aVBut in fact, it was just coming up \u2014
p592
aVit was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
p593
aVSo \u2014 and Arrhenius' theory \u2014
p594
aVand all the global warmers think \u2014
p595
aVthey would say, yeah, it should go up in the daytime, too,
p596
aVif it's the greenhouse effect.
p597
aVNow, people like things that have, like, names like that,
p598
aVthat they can envision it, right? I mean \u2014
p599
aVbut people don't like things like this, so \u2014 most \u2014 I mean,
p600
aVyou don't get all excited about things
p601
aVlike the actual evidence, you know,
p602
aVwhich would be evidence for strengthening
p603
aVof the tropical circulation in the 1990s.
p604
aVIt's a paper that came out in February,
p605
aVand most of you probably hadn't heard about it.
p606
aV"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability
p607
aVin the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget."
p608
aVExcuse me. Those papers were published by NASA,
p609
aVand some scientists at Columbia, and Viliki
p610
aVand a whole bunch of people, Princeton.
p611
aVAnd those two papers came out in Science Magazine,
p612
aVFebruary the first,
p613
aVand these \u2014 the conclusion in both of these papers,
p614
aVand in also the Science editor's, like,
p615
aVdescriptions of these papers, for, you know,
p616
aVfor the quickie,
p617
aVis that our theories about global warming
p618
aVare completely wrong. I mean,
p619
aVwhat these guys were doing,
p620
aVand this is what \u2014 the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.
p621
aVThey say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up \u2014
p622
aVit's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for 20 years,
p623
aVfrom satellites, and it isn't going up.
p624
aVAnd in this paper, they show something much more striking,
p625
aVand that was that they did what they call a radiation \u2014
p626
aVand I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated,
p627
aVbut it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is
p628
aVby the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it, they say,
p629
aVthe sun puts out a certain amount of energy \u2014
p630
aVwe know how much that is \u2014
p631
aVit falls on the earth, the earth gives back a certain amount.
p632
aVWhen it gets warm it generates \u2014
p633
aVit makes redder energy \u2014 I mean, like infra-red,
p634
aVlike something that's warm gives off infra-red.
p635
aVThe whole business of the global warming \u2014
p636
aVtrash, really,
p637
aVis that \u2014 if the \u2014 if there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere,
p638
aVthe heat that's trying to escape
p639
aVwon't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun,
p640
aVwhich is mostly down in the \u2014 it's like 350 nanometers,
p641
aVwhich is where it's centered \u2014 that goes right through CO2.
p642
aVSo you still get heated, but you don't dissipate any.
p643
aVWell, these guys measured all of those things.
p644
aVI mean, you can talk about that stuff,
p645
aVand you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it,
p646
aVbut these \u2014 they actually measured it,
p647
aVand it turns out that in the last 10 years \u2014
p648
aVthat's why they say "decadal" there \u2014
p649
aVthat the energy \u2014 that the level
p650
aVof what they call "imbalance"
p651
aVhas been way the hell over what was expected.
p652
aVLike, the amount of imbalance \u2014
p653
aVmeaning, heat's coming in and it's not going out
p654
aVthat you would get from having double the CO2,
p655
aVwhich we're not anywhere near that, by the way.
p656
aVBut if we did, in 2025 or something,
p657
aVhave double the CO2 as we had in 1900,
p658
aVthey say it would be increase the energy budget
p659
aVby about \u2014 in other words,
p660
aVone watt per square centimeter more
p661
aVwould be coming in than going out.
p662
aVSo the planet should get warmer.
p663
aVWell, they found out in this study \u2014 these two studies
p664
aVby two different teams \u2014
p665
aVthat five and a half watts
p666
aVper square meter
p667
aVhad been coming in from 1998, 1999,
p668
aVand the place didn't get warmer.
p669
aVSo the theory's kaput \u2014 it's nothing.
p670
aVThese papers should have been called,
p671
aV"The End to the Global Warming Fiasco," you know.
p672
aVThey're concerned,
p673
aVand you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers,
p674
aVbecause they're talking about big laboratories
p675
aVthat are funded by lots of money
p676
aVand by scared people.
p677
aVYou know, if they said, you know what?
p678
aVThere isn't a problem with global warming any longer,
p679
aVso we can \u2014 you know, they're funding.
p680
aVAnd if you start a grant request with something like that,
p681
aVand say, global warming obviously hadn't happened...
p682
aVif they \u2014 if they \u2014 if they actually \u2014 if they actually said that,
p683
aVI'm getting out.
p684
aV(Laughter)
p685
aVI'll stand up too, and \u2014
p686
aV(Laughter)
p687
aV(Applause)
p688
aVThey have to say that.
p689
aVThey had to be very cautious.
p690
aVBut what I'm saying is, you can be delighted,
p691
aVbecause the editor of Science, who is no dummy,
p692
aVand both of these fairly professional \u2014
p693
aVreally professional teams, have really come to the same conclusion
p694
aVand in the bottom lines in their papers
p695
aVthey have to say, what this means is, that what we've been thinking,
p696
aVwas the global circulation model that we predict
p697
aVthat the earth is going to get overheated
p698
aVthat it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor.
p699
aVIt's not by a small one. They just \u2014
p700
aVthey just misinterpreted the fact that the earth \u2014
p701
aVthere's obviously some mechanisms going on
p702
aVthat nobody knew about,
p703
aVbecause the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.
p704
aVSo the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know,
p705
aVit's big and horrible \u2014 and big and wonderful,
p706
aVand it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about.
p707
aVSo I mean, the reason I put those things all together,
p708
aVOK, here's the way you're supposed to do science \u2014
p709
aVsome science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity.
p710
aVAnd there's a lot of things like global warming,
p711
aVand ozone hole and you know,
p712
aVa whole bunch of scientific public issues,
p713
aVthat if you're interested in them,
p714
aVthen you have to get down the details, and read the papers called,
p715
aV"Large Decadal Variability in the..."
p716
aVYou have to figure out what all those words mean.
p717
aVAnd if you just listen to the guys
p718
aVwho are hyping those issues, and making a lot of money out of it,
p719
aVyou'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things.
p720
aVRemember the 10 things that are going to get you. The \u2014 one of them \u2014
p721
aV(Laughter)
p722
aVAnd the asteroids is the one I really agree with there.
p723
aVI mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK, thank you for having me here.
