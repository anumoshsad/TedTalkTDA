VGood morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,
p4
aVI was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.
p5
aVWell, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,
p6
aVwhich, as some of you may know,
p7
aVis not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.
p8
aVSo that's why I've always been fascinated
p9
aVwith how technology could actually reshape
p10
aVand open up authoritarian societies like ours.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, I'm graduating college
p13
aVand, feeling very idealistic,
p14
aVI decided to join the NGO
p15
aVwhich actually was using new media
p16
aVto promote democracy and media reform
p17
aVin much of the former Soviet Union.
p18
aVHowever, to my surprise,
p19
aVI discovered that dictatorships
p20
aVdo not crumble so easily.
p21
aVIn fact, some of them actually
p22
aVsurvived the Internet challenge,
p23
aVand some got even more repressive.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo this is when I ran out of my idealism and
p26
aVdecided to quit my NGO job
p27
aVand actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.
p28
aVNow, I must tell you that this was never
p29
aVa very popular argument,
p30
aVand it's probably not very popular yet
p31
aVwith some of you sitting in this audience.
p32
aVIt was never popular with many political leaders,
p33
aVespecially those in the United States
p34
aVwho somehow thought that new media
p35
aVwould be able to do what missiles couldn't.
p36
aVThat is, promote democracy in difficult places
p37
aVwhere everything else has already been tried and failed.
p38
aVAnd I think by 2009,
p39
aVthis news has finally reached Britain,
p40
aVso I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.
p41
aa(lp42
VHowever, there is an underlying argument about logistics,
p43
aVwhich has driven so much of this debate. Right?
p44
aVSo if you look at it close enough,
p45
aVyou'll actually see that much of this
p46
aVis about economics.
p47
aVThe cybertopians say, much like fax machines
p48
aVand Xerox machines did in the '80s,
p49
aVblogs and social networks
p50
aVhave radically transformed the economics of protest,
p51
aVso people would inevitably rebel.
p52
aVTo put it very simply,
p53
aVthe assumption so far has been
p54
aVthat if you give people enough connectivity,
p55
aVif you give them enough devices,
p56
aVdemocracy will inevitably follow.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd to tell you the truth,
p59
aVI never really bought into this argument,
p60
aVin part because I never saw three American presidents
p61
aVagree on anything else in the past.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVBut, you know, even beyond that,
p64
aVif you think about the logic underlying it,
p65
aVis something I call iPod liberalism,
p66
aVwhere we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese
p67
aVwho happens to have and love his iPod
p68
aVwill also love liberal democracy.
p69
aVAnd again, I think this is kind of false.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut I think a much bigger problem with this
p72
aVis that this logic \u2014
p73
aVthat we should be dropping iPods not bombs \u2014
p74
aVI mean, it would make a fascinating title
p75
aVfor Thomas Friedman's new book.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVBut this is rarely a good sign. Right?
p78
aVSo, the bigger problem with this logic
p79
aVis that it confuses the intended
p80
aVversus the actual uses of technology.
p81
aVFor those of you who think that
p82
aVnew media of the Internet
p83
aVcould somehow help us avert genocide,
p84
aVshould look no further than Rwanda,
p85
aVwhere in the '90s it was actually two radio stations
p86
aVwhich were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,
p89
aVwhat you can actually see
p90
aVis that certain governments
p91
aVhave mastered the use of cyberspace
p92
aVfor propaganda purposes. Right?
p93
aVAnd they are building what I call the Spinternet.
p94
aVThe combination of spin, on the one hand,
p95
aVand the Internet on the other.
p96
aVSo governments from Russia to China to Iran
p97
aVare actually hiring, training and paying bloggers
p98
aVin order to leave ideological comments
p99
aVand create a lot of ideological blog posts
p100
aVto comment on sensitive political issues. Right?
p101
aa(lp102
VSo you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?
p103
aVWhy are they engaging with cyberspace?
p104
aVWell my theory is that
p105
aVit's happening because censorship actually
p106
aVis less effective than you think it is in many of those places.
p107
aVThe moment you put something critical in a blog,
p108
aVeven if you manage to ban it immediately,
p109
aVit will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.
p110
aVSo the more you block it,
p111
aVthe more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship
p112
aVand thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
p113
aVSo the only way to control this message
p114
aVis actually to try to spin it
p115
aVand accuse anyone who has written something critical
p116
aVof being, for example, a CIA agent.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd, again, this is happening quite often.
p119
aVJust to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.
p120
aVThere was a big case in February 2009
p121
aVcalled "Elude the Cat."
p122
aVAnd for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.
p123
aVSo what happened is that a 24-year-old man,
p124
aVa Chinese man, died in prison custody.
p125
aVAnd police said that it happened
p126
aVbecause he was playing hide and seek,
p127
aVwhich is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,
p128
aVwith other inmates and hit his head
p129
aVagainst the wall,
p130
aVwhich was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.
p133
aVIn fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,
p134
aVhad 35,000 comments
p135
aVon this issue within hours.
p136
aVBut then authorities did something very smart.
p137
aVInstead of trying to purge these comments,
p138
aVthey instead went and reached out to the bloggers.
p139
aVAnd they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."
p140
aVSo 500 people applied,
p141
aVand four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,
p142
aVand thus inspect it and then blog about it.
p143
aVWithin days the entire incident was forgotten,
p144
aVwhich would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.
p145
aVPeople would keep talking about it for weeks.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd this actually fits with another interesting theory
p148
aVabout what's happening in authoritarian states
p149
aVand in their cyberspace.
p150
aVThis is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,
p151
aVand it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics
p152
aVand letting them engage with each other online.
p153
aVWe tend to think
p154
aVthat somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,
p155
aVbut in many cases it only strengthens them.
p156
aVAnd you may wonder why.
p157
aVI'll just give you a very short list of reasons
p158
aVwhy authoritarian deliberation
p159
aVmay actually help the dictators.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd first it's quite simple.
p162
aVMost of them operate in a complete information vacuum.
p163
aVThey don't really have the data they need
p164
aVin order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.
p165
aVSo encouraging people to actually go online
p166
aVand share information and data
p167
aVon blogs and wikis is great
p168
aVbecause otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats
p169
aVwill continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?
p170
aVSo from this perspective, having blogs and wikis
p171
aVproduce knowledge has been great.
p172
aa(lp173
VSecondly, involving public in any decision making
p174
aVis also great
p175
aVbecause it helps you to share the blame
p176
aVfor the policies which eventually fail.
p177
aVBecause they say, "Well look, we asked you,
p178
aVwe consulted you, you voted on it.
p179
aVYou put it on the front page of your blog.
p180
aVWell, great. You are the one who is to blame."
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd finally, the purpose of
p183
aVany authoritarian deliberation efforts
p184
aVis usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.
p185
aVSo inviting people to all sorts of public forums,
p186
aVhaving them participate in decision making,
p187
aVit's actually great.
p188
aVBecause what happens is that then
p189
aVyou can actually point to this initiative and say,
p190
aV"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."
p191
aa(lp192
VJust to give you an example,
p193
aVone of the Russian regions, for example,
p194
aVnow involves its citizens
p195
aVin planning its strategy up until year 2020.
p196
aVRight? So they can go online
p197
aVand contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.
p198
aVI mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know
p199
aVthat there was no planning in Russia for the next month.
p200
aVSo having people involved in planning for 2020
p201
aVis not necessarily going to change anything,
p202
aVbecause the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.
p203
aa(lp204
VJust to give you an example from Iran,
p205
aVwe all heard about the Twitter revolution
p206
aVthat happened there,
p207
aVbut if you look close enough, you'll actually see
p208
aVthat many of the networks and blogs
p209
aVand Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.
p210
aVThey may have become slower,
p211
aVbut the activists could still access it
p212
aVand actually argue that having access to them
p213
aVis actually great for many authoritarian states.
p214
aVAnd it's great simply because
p215
aVthey can gather open source intelligence.
p216
aa(lp217
VIn the past it would take you weeks, if not months,
p218
aVto identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.
p219
aVNow you actually know how they connect to each other
p220
aVby looking at their Facebook page.
p221
aVI mean KGB, and not just KGB,
p222
aVused to torture in order to actually get this data.
p223
aVNow it's all available online.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VBut I think the biggest conceptual pitfall
p227
aVthat cybertopians made
p228
aVis when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.
p229
aVWe often hear about cyber activism,
p230
aVhow people are getting more active because of the Internet.
p231
aVRarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,
p232
aVhow people are becoming passive.
p233
aVWhy? Because they somehow assume that the Internet
p234
aVis going to be the catalyst of change
p235
aVthat will push young people into the streets,
p236
aVwhile in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses
p237
aVwhich will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
p238
aVThat's not an option being considered too strongly.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,
p241
aVthere may as well be two digital captives
p242
aVwho are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
p243
aVAnd this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it
p244
aVbecause the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people
p245
aVand it plays a completely different social role for them.
p246
aa(lp247
VIf you look at some of the surveys
p248
aVon how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,
p249
aVyou'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,
p250
aVfor whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,
p251
aVis three times more than in the United States.
p252
aVSo it does play a social role,
p253
aVhowever it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo the way I tend to think of it
p256
aVis like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,
p257
aVa total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.
p258
aVBut the point here is that
p259
aVwhen we get the remote Russian village online,
p260
aVwhat will get people to the Internet
p261
aVis not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.
p262
aVIt's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"
p263
aVor maybe watching funny videos of cats.
p264
aVSo this is something you have to recognize.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what should we do about it?
p267
aVWell I say we have to stop thinking
p268
aVabout the number of iPods per capita
p269
aVand start thinking about ways in which
p270
aVwe can empower intellectuals,
p271
aVdissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.
p272
aVBecause even what has been happening up 'til now
p273
aVwith the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,
p274
aVthere is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.
p275
aVSo I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions
p276
aVand actually start doing something about it.
p277
aVThank you.
