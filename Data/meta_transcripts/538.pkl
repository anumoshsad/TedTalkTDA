VSo sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.
p4
aVI got invited to speak to the people
p5
aVwho dress up in big stuffed animal costumes
p6
aVto perform at sporting events.
p7
aVUnfortunately I couldn't go.
p8
aVBut it got me thinking about
p9
aVthe fact that these guys, at least most of them,
p10
aVknow what it is that they do for a living.
p11
aVWhat they do is they dress up
p12
aVas stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.
p13
aa(lp14
VShortly after that I got invited
p15
aVto speak at the convention of the people
p16
aVwho make balloon animals.
p17
aVAnd again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.
p18
aVThere is a big schism between the ones who make
p19
aVgospel animals and porn animals, but \u2014
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVthey do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.
p22
aVSometimes they get in trouble, but not often.
p23
aVAnd the other thing about these guys
p24
aVis, they also know what they do for a living.
p25
aVThey make balloon animals.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut what do we do for a living?
p28
aVWhat exactly to the people watching this do every day?
p29
aVAnd I want to argue that what we do
p30
aVis we try to change everything.
p31
aVThat we try to find a piece of the status quo \u2014
p32
aVsomething that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,
p33
aVsomething that is itching to be changed \u2014 and we change it.
p34
aVWe try to make big, permanent, important change.
p35
aVBut we don't think about it that way.
p36
aVAnd we haven't spent a lot of time talking about
p37
aVwhat that process is like.
p38
aVAnd I've been studying it for a couple years.
p39
aVAnd I want to share a couple stories with you today.
p40
aa(lp41
VFirst, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.
p42
aVNathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.
p43
aVAnd what you may not know about the history of the SPCA
p44
aVis, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.
p45
aVCities gave them a charter
p46
aVto get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.
p47
aVIn a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,
p48
aVmost of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.
p49
aVNathan and his boss saw this,
p50
aVand they could not tolerate it.
p51
aVSo they set out to make San Francisco
p52
aVa no-kill city:
p53
aVcreate an entire city
p54
aVwhere every dog and cat,
p55
aVunless it was ill or dangerous,
p56
aVwould be adopted, not killed.
p57
aVAnd everyone said it was impossible.
p58
aVNathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.
p59
aVAnd people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country
p60
aVflew to San Francisco
p61
aVto testify against them \u2014
p62
aVto say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.
p63
aVThey persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.
p64
aVHe connected with people who cared about this:
p65
aVnonprofessionals, people with passion.
p66
aVAnd within just a couple years,
p67
aVSan Francisco became the first no-kill city,
p68
aVrunning no deficit, completely supported by the community.
p69
aVNathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York \u2014
p70
aVa place as different from San Francisco
p71
aVas you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.
p72
aVHe went from being a glorified dogcatcher
p73
aVto completely transforming the community.
p74
aVAnd then he went to North Carolina and did it again.
p75
aVAnd he went to Reno and he did it again.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd when I think about what Nathan did,
p78
aVand when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.
p79
aVAnd I think about the idea that
p80
aVcreating an idea, spreading an idea
p81
aVhas a lot behind it.
p82
aVI don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,
p83
aVbut what they do is, they take a light bulb
p84
aVand they smash it.
p85
aVNow there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.
p86
aVBut one reason is because it indicates a change,
p87
aVfrom before to after.
p88
aVIt is a moment in time.
p89
aVAnd I want to argue that we are living through
p90
aVand are right at the key moment
p91
aVof a change in the way ideas are created
p92
aVand spread and implemented.
p93
aa(lp94
VWe started with the factory idea:
p95
aVthat you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory
p96
aVthat could churn out change.
p97
aVWe then went to the TV idea,
p98
aVthat said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,
p99
aVif you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.
p100
aVAnd now we're in this new model of leadership,
p101
aVwhere the way we make change
p102
aVis not by using money
p103
aVor power to lever a system,
p104
aVbut by leading.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.
p107
aVHenry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
p108
aVIt enables him to hire men
p109
aVwho used to get paid 50 cents a day
p110
aVand pay them five dollars a day.
p111
aVBecause he's got an efficient enough factory.
p112
aVWell with that sort of advantage
p113
aVyou can churn out a lot of cars.
p114
aVYou can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.
p115
aVYou can change the fabric of an entire country.
p116
aVThat the essence of what you're doing is you need
p117
aVever-cheaper labor,
p118
aVand ever-faster machines.
p119
aVAnd the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.
p120
aVEver-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VSo we shift gears for a minute,
p124
aVand say, "I know: television;
p125
aVadvertising. Push push.
p126
aVTake a good idea and push it on the world.
p127
aVI have a better mousetrap.
p128
aVAnd if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."
p129
aVAnd you can build an entire industry on that.
p130
aVIf necessary you can put babies in your ads.
p131
aVIf necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.
p132
aVAnd if babies don't work, you can use doctors.
p133
aVBut be careful.
p134
aVBecause you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,
p135
aVwhere you're talking about one thing instead of the other.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVThis model requires you to act like the king,
p138
aVlike the person in the front of the room
p139
aVthrowing things to the peons in the back.
p140
aVThat you are in charge, and you're going to tell people
p141
aVwhat to do next.
p142
aVThe quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,
p143
aVand you are pushing it out to the world.
p144
aVThis method \u2014 mass marketing \u2014
p145
aVrequires average ideas,
p146
aVbecause you're going to the masses,
p147
aVand plenty of ads.
p148
aVWhat we've done as spammers
p149
aVis tried to hypnotize everyone
p150
aVinto buying our idea,
p151
aVhypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,
p152
aVhypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.
p153
aVAnd, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VBut there is good news around the corner \u2014 really good news.
p157
aVI call it the idea of tribes.
p158
aVWhat tribes are, is a very simple concept
p159
aVthat goes back 50,000 years.
p160
aVIt's about leading and connecting people and ideas.
p161
aVAnd it's something that people have wanted forever.
p162
aVLots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,
p163
aVhaving a work tribe,
p164
aVhaving a community tribe.
p165
aVBut now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,
p166
aVthanks to a lot of other things
p167
aVthat are bubbling through our society around the world,
p168
aVtribes are everywhere.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.
p171
aVInstead what it's allowed is silos of interest.
p172
aVSo you've got the red-hat ladies over here.
p173
aVYou've got the red-hat triathletes over there.
p174
aVYou've got the organized armies over here.
p175
aVYou've got the disorganized rebels over here.
p176
aVYou've got people in white hats making food.
p177
aVAnd people in white hats sailing boats.
p178
aVThe point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers
p179
aVand connect with them,
p180
aVbecause you want to be connected.
p181
aVThat people on the fringes
p182
aVcan find each other, connect and go somewhere.
p183
aVEvery town that has a volunteer fire department
p184
aVunderstands this way of thinking.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VNow it turns out
p188
aVthis is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.
p189
aVPeople I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.
p190
aVAnd that what firemen do to train sometimes
p191
aVis they take a house that is going to be torn down,
p192
aVand they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.
p193
aVBut they always stop and take a picture.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VYou know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.
p197
aVThey've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.
p198
aVYou can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.
p199
aVAnd it turns out that it's tribes \u2014
p200
aVnot money, not factories \u2014
p201
aVthat can change our world, that can change politics,
p202
aVthat can align large numbers of people.
p203
aVNot because you force them to do something against their will,
p204
aVbut because they wanted to connect.
p205
aa(lp206
VThat what we do for a living now,
p207
aVall of us, I think,
p208
aVis find something worth changing,
p209
aVand then assemble tribes that assemble tribes
p210
aVthat spread the idea and spread the idea.
p211
aVAnd it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,
p212
aVit becomes a movement.
p213
aVSo when Al Gore set out
p214
aVto change the world again,
p215
aVhe didn't do it by himself.
p216
aVAnd he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.
p217
aVHe did it by creating a movement.
p218
aVThousands of people around the country
p219
aVwho could give his presentation for him,
p220
aVbecause he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.
p221
aa(lp222
VYou don't need everyone.
p223
aVWhat Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,
p224
aVI don't know, a thousand true fans \u2014
p225
aVa thousand people who care enough
p226
aVthat they will get you the next round
p227
aVand the next round and the next round.
p228
aVAnd that means that the idea you create, the product you create,
p229
aVthe movement you create isn't for everyone,
p230
aVit's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.
p231
aVWhat it's about instead
p232
aVis finding the true believers.
p233
aVIt's easy to look at what I've said so far,
p234
aVand say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."
p235
aa(lp236
VSo here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.
p237
aVThey're about the same age. But that's about it.
p238
aVWhat they did, though, is each in their own way,
p239
aVcreated a different way
p240
aVof navigating your way through technology.
p241
aVSo some people will go out and get people to be on one team.
p242
aVAnd some people will get people to be on the other team.
p243
aa(lp244
VIt also informs the decisions you make
p245
aVwhen you make products or services.
p246
aVYou know, this is one of my favorite devices.
p247
aVBut what a shame that it's not organized
p248
aVto help authors create movements.
p249
aVWhat would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,
p250
aVyou could see the comments and quotes and notes
p251
aVfrom all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.
p252
aVOr from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.
p253
aVWhat would happen if authors, or people with ideas
p254
aVcould use version two, which comes out on Monday,
p255
aVand use it to organize people
p256
aVwho want to talk about something.
p257
aVNow there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.
p258
aVBut let me just try a couple.
p259
aa(lp260
VThe Beatles did not invent teenagers.
p261
aVThey merely decided to lead them.
p262
aVThat most movements, most leadership that we're doing
p263
aVis about finding a group that's disconnected
p264
aVbut already has a yearning \u2014
p265
aVnot persuading people to want something
p266
aVthey don't have yet.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhen Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,"
p269
aVher video that spread all across the internet
p270
aVabout the way farm animals are treated,
p271
aVshe didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.
p272
aVShe didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.
p273
aVBut she helped organize people,
p274
aVand helped turn it into a movement.
p275
aa(lp276
VHugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected
p277
aVmiddle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.
p278
aa(lp279
VBob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.
p280
aVHe just stepped up and said, "Follow me."
p281
aa(lp282
VDerek Sivers invented CD Baby,
p283
aVwhich allowed independent musicians
p284
aVto have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man \u2014
p285
aVto have place to take the mission
p286
aVthey already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhat all these people have in common is that they are heretics.
p289
aVThat heretics look at the status quo and say,
p290
aV"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.
p291
aVI am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.
p292
aVI see what the status quo is; I don't like it."
p293
aVThat instead of looking at all the little rules
p294
aVand following each one of them,
p295
aVthat instead of being what I call a sheepwalker \u2014
p296
aVsomebody who's half asleep,
p297
aVfollowing instructions,
p298
aVkeeping their head down, fitting in \u2014
p299
aVevery once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."
p300
aVSomeone stands up and says, "This one is important.
p301
aVWe need to organize around it."
p302
aVAnd not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.
p303
aVYou just need a few people \u2014
p304
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p305
aVwho will look at the rules,
p306
aVrealize they make no sense,
p307
aVand realize how much they want to be connected.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.
p310
aVZappos isn't a shoe store.
p311
aVZappos is the one, the only,
p312
aVthe best-there-ever-was
p313
aVplace for people who are into shoes to find each other,
p314
aVto talk about their passion,
p315
aVto connect with people who care more
p316
aVabout customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.
p317
aVIt can be something as prosaic as shoes,
p318
aVand something as complicated as overthrowing a government.
p319
aVIt's exactly the same behavior though.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhat it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,
p322
aVis to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.
p323
aVBut if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,
p324
aVthen together we can get something that we all want.
p325
aVWe're just waiting for someone to lead us."
p326
aa(lp327
VMichelle Kaufman has pioneered
p328
aVnew ways of thinking about environmental architecture.
p329
aVShe doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
p330
aVShe does it by telling a story
p331
aVto people who want to hear it.
p332
aVBy connecting a tribe of people
p333
aVwho are desperate to be connected to each other.
p334
aVBy leading a movement and
p335
aVmaking change.
p336
aVAnd around and around and around it goes.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo three questions I'd offer you.
p339
aVThe first one is, who exactly
p340
aVare you upsetting?
p341
aVBecause if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.
p342
aVThe second question is, who are you connecting?
p343
aVBecause for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:
p344
aVthe connections that are being made, one to the other.
p345
aVAnd the third one is, who are you leading?
p346
aVBecause focusing on that part of it \u2014
p347
aVnot the mechanics of what you're building,
p348
aVbut the who, and the leading part \u2014 is where change comes.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.
p351
aV"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes
p352
aVI gave exactly the same pair to someone
p353
aVwho doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"
p354
aVThis is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.
p355
aVIt's a story of a product that tells a story.
p356
aVAnd as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes
p357
aVand someone says, "What are those?"
p358
aVYou get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,
p359
aVon behalf of the people who got the shoes.
p360
aVAnd suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.
p361
aVIt's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.
p362
aa(lp363
VMy friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years
p364
aVfighting against juvenile diabetes.
p365
aVNot fighting the organization that's fighting it \u2014 fighting with them, leading them,
p366
aVconnecting them, challenging the status quo
p367
aVbecause it's important to him.
p368
aVAnd the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.
p369
aVThey need the leadership. It makes a difference.
p370
aa(lp371
VYou don't need permission from people to lead them.
p372
aVBut in case you do, here it is:
p373
aVthey're waiting, we're waiting
p374
aVfor you to show us where to go next.
p375
aVSo here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge
p376
aVthe status quo.
p377
aVThey challenge what's currently there.
p378
aVThe second thing is, they build a culture.
p379
aVA secret language, a seven-second handshake,
p380
aVa way of knowing that you're in or out.
p381
aVThey have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,
p382
aVcuriosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.
p383
aVThey connect people to one another.
p384
aVDo you know what people want more than anything?
p385
aVThey want to be missed.
p386
aVThey want to be missed the day they don't show up.
p387
aVThey want to be missed when they're gone.
p388
aVAnd tribe leaders can do that.
p389
aVIt's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,
p390
aVbut you don't need charisma to become a leader.
p391
aVBeing a leader gives you charisma.
p392
aVIf you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,
p393
aVthat's where charisma comes from \u2014 from the leading.
p394
aVFinally, they commit.
p395
aVThey commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.
p396
aVThey commit to the people who are there.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo I'd like you to do something for me.
p399
aVAnd I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.
p400
aVWhat I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,
p401
aVis: create a movement.
p402
aVSomething that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.
p403
aVThank you very much. I appreciate it.
