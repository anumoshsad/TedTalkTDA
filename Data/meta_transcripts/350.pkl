VI'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.
p4
aVAnd before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.
p5
aVAnd then I was an entertainer, I guess.
p6
aVAnd before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was \u2014
p7
aVI was out of the house at about 15 and a half,
p8
aVand I never wound up going into college.
p9
aVI didn't really \u2014 I didn't see the point at the time.
p10
aVI do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aVIt's really cool.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,
p16
aVat least from my small aperture of the world.
p17
aVThis is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.
p18
aVI'm in my garage, making weird stuff.
p19
aVAnd then you go to these toy companies
p20
aVand there's some guy across the table,
p21
aVand he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."
p22
aVYou know, you think it's so cool, but they \u2014
p23
aVanyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.
p24
aVThis is the name of my company, Giving Toys.
p25
aVSo I used to work at Mattel, actually.
p26
aVAnd after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,
p27
aVand then got the license to make the maker.
p28
aVSo this is a hamburger maker that
p29
aVyou take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes \u2014
p30
aVand this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.
p31
aVI beat up the pasta maker to make that.
p32
aVThen this is a McNugget maker, I think.
p33
aVThis, now that's the McNugget maker,
p34
aVand this is a \u2014 this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.
p35
aVAnd let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,
p36
aVand then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you \u2014
p37
aVshe's about 300 pounds now.
p38
aVNo, she's not, she's beautiful.
p39
aVThis is how they looked when they came out at the end.
p40
aVThese are a \u2014 this is like a 15 million dollar line.
p41
aVAnd it got me through some \u2014 I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.
p42
aa(lp43
VNext is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.
p44
aVThat was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.
p45
aVThis is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.
p46
aVThis is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."
p47
aVThat was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.
p48
aVThat paid the rent for about a month.
p49
aVThis is a walking Barbie \u2014 I said, "Oh, this is it!"
p50
aVAnd they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.
p51
aVSo this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.
p52
aVThey fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?
p53
aVAnd they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.
p54
aVThey're pretty cool.
p55
aVThis is a\u2014 we're doing some flight-testing
p56
aVon my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.
p57
aVIt does pretty good.
p58
aVI'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.
p59
aVIt's how they, see, have those album things \u2014 kids don't know what they are.
p60
aVThis is a clay maker.
p61
aVYou know, I said \u2014 I went to Play-Doh,
p62
aVand said, "Look, I can animate this."
p63
aVThey said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."
p64
aVAnd then, I made a Lego animator.
p65
aVI thought, this would be so great!
p66
aVAnd you know, Lego \u2014 don't take Legos to Lego.
p67
aVThat's the answer. They know everything about it.
p68
aa(lp69
VThen I started doing animatronics.
p70
aVI loved dinosaurs.
p71
aVI used to be in the film business, kind of,
p72
aVand actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,
p73
aVand anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."
p74
aVYou know, how \u2014 why would a kid want a dinosaur?
p75
aVThis is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.
p76
aVThat's David Letterman.
p77
aVYou can see how old this stuff is.
p78
aVThat's my youngest cousin.
p79
aVThis is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."
p80
aVWe had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.
p81
aVMy career basically peaked here.
p82
aVAnd in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.
p83
aVThis is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.
p84
aVSo this is a \u2014 I used to kind of be an actor.
p85
aVAnd I'm really not very good at it.
p86
aVBut the \u2014 this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,
p87
aVwho would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.
p88
aVAnd you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.
p89
aVAnd over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.
p90
aVAnd a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.
p91
aVThis is a \u2014 you can see the little window there.
p92
aVYou can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.
p93
aVYou see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.
p94
aVWay ahead of my time here.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...
p97
aVNarrator: I love toys!
p98
aa(lp99
VCaleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.
p100
aVOK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a \u2014
p101
aVthat was the first batch of products.
p102
aVMost of them did not go.
p103
aVYou get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.
p104
aVAnd every now and then, we do something like a,
p105
aVyou know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,
p106
aVthat tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and \u2014
p107
aVand we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.
p108
aVBut eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,
p109
aVwhere there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.
p110
aVAnd I started working on this project
p111
aV\u2014 oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.
p112
aVThroughout this whole thing, making toys,
p113
aVI think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.
p114
aVThere's some kind of a blend that happens
p115
aVthat allows, you know, to find innovation.
p116
aVAnd I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol
p117
aVthat means something, to me anyway.
p118
aVAnd so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,
p119
aVthat's where I think innovation happens.
p120
aVAnd actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.
p121
aVBut it's not how you actually get leverage.
p122
aVActually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.
p123
aVAnd those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.
p124
aVBut moving on.
p125
aVSo, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.
p126
aVAs he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.
p127
aVI did the body and creature \u2014 well, you'll see.
p128
aVSo by way of showing you this, you can kind of
p129
aVget an understanding of what it is to,
p130
aVhopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology
p131
aVthat has an emotional connection with the user.
p132
aVSo this is my family.
p133
aVThis is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,
p134
aVand my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.
p135
aVAll right, there's that robot again.
p136
aVI came out of the movie business, as I said,
p137
aVand I said, let's make these animatronic robots.
p138
aVLet's make these things.
p139
aVAnd so I've always had a big interest in this.
p140
aVThis one actually didn't go anywhere,
p141
aVbut I got my feet wet doing this.
p142
aVThis is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.
p143
aVA little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,
p144
aVlots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.
p145
aVThere's another one.
p146
aVHe actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.
p147
aVOh, this is a little pony, little pony \u2014 very cute little thing.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.
p150
aVSo the challenge was \u2014 I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,
p151
aVworking on the Microsoft Barney.
p152
aVAnd this is a \u2014 you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.
p153
aVAnd, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.
p154
aVAnd then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse
p155
aVfull of this stuff and see if they sell.
p156
aVSo it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.
p157
aVBut anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,
p158
aVdecided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.
p159
aVWhat's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?
p160
aVAnd that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.
p161
aVAnd so, I have all these design books,
p162
aVlike I'm sure many of you have.
p163
aVAnd throughout the books \u2014 this is the first page on Furby \u2014
p164
aVI have kind of the art and science.
p165
aVI have the why over here, and the how over there.
p166
aVI try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.
p167
aVBecause they're not just "bing" ideas;
p168
aVyou have to really dig deep in these things.
p169
aVSo there's some real pseudo-code over here,
p170
aVand getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.
p171
aVAnd originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.
p172
aVAnd then we said, well, you're going to feed him,
p173
aVand he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.
p174
aVAnd then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor
p175
aVto make the eyes move, and the ears move,
p176
aVand the body to move, and the mouth to move.
p177
aVAnd, you know, I want to make it blink
p178
aVand do all that at the same time.
p179
aVWell, I came up with this kind of linear
p180
aVexpression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.
p181
aVThen I started to get a little more realistic
p182
aVand I have to start drawing the stuff.
p183
aVAnd there's my "note to self" at the top:
p184
aV"lots of engineering."
p185
aVSo that turned out to be a little more than true.
p186
aVThere's my first exploded view and all the little pieces
p187
aVand the little worm drive and all that stuff.
p188
aVAnd then I've got to start building it,
p189
aVso this is the real thing.
p190
aVI get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.
p191
aVAnd that's my little workshop.
p192
aVAnd there's the first little cam that drove Furby.
p193
aVAnd there's Furby on the half shell.
p194
aVYou can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.
p195
aVI just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.
p196
aVSo there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.
p197
aVAnd there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.
p198
aVNo, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVSo right now, you see, I love little robots.
p201
aVSo my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."
p202
aVSo she comes to the rescue.
p203
aVThis is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,
p204
aVmy muse and my partner for eternity here.
p205
aVAnd she does drawings, right?
p206
aVShe's an actual, you know, artist.
p207
aVAnd she starts doing all these different drawings
p208
aVand does color patterns and coloring books.
p209
aVAnd I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.
p210
aVHe didn't test so well, but I like him.
p211
aVAnd then she started doing these other images.
p212
aVAt that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,
p213
aVand we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.
p214
aVSo here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.
p215
aVAnd here's \u2014 this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.
p216
aVThere's my favorite, Demon Furby.
p217
aVThat was a good one.
p218
aVAnyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,
p219
aVlittle poufy body, a little imaginary character.
p220
aVAnd there he is, a little bush baby on \u2014 caught in the headlights there.
p221
aVI actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,
p222
aVripped it apart and made this.
p223
aVAnd since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us
p224
aVwith dolls or something, they disappear from my desk
p225
aVand they get hidden in the house.
p226
aVI have three girls and they just, they \u2014
p227
aVit's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVSo, a little tether coming off,
p230
aVit's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.
p231
aVIt's just a little server control and I made a little video going:
p232
aV"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"
p233
aVyou know, and then I'd reach my hand.
p234
aVHe'd \u2014 you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,
p235
aV"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.
p236
aVAnd Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,
p237
aVsaid, "Yeah, we want to do this.
p238
aVWe have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,
p239
aVand we're going to hire you guys to do this."
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd so Dave and I got working.
p242
aVMostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.
p243
aVSo now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff
p244
aVI don't know how to do.
p245
aVAnd I started working with Solid Works
p246
aVand a whole other group to do that.
p247
aVAnd we started \u2014
p248
aVthis was way back before there was really much SLA going on,
p249
aVnot a lot of rapid prototyping.
p250
aVWe certainly didn't have the money to do this.
p251
aVThey only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,
p252
aVso I had to call a friend of a friend
p253
aVwho was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.
p254
aVAnd they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."
p255
aVSo they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.
p256
aVAnd the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.
p257
aVWe snuck in on the weekend.
p258
aVAnd so we just had a disc of the files.
p259
aVBut they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.
p260
aVSo we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.
p261
aVAnd on the weekend we ran the parts for that.
p262
aVSo this is how they come out close to the end.
p263
aVAnd then they looked like little Garfields there.
p264
aVEight months later \u2014 you may remember this,
p265
aVthis was a \u2014 total, total, total chaos.
p266
aVFor a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.
p267
aVThey actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.
p268
aVI \u2014 it's unbelievable how \u2014 I don't know how that can be.
p269
aVAnd Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.
p270
aVAnd I just a little bit on each one.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo full circle \u2014 why do I do this?
p273
aVWhy do you, you know, try to do this stuff?
p274
aVAnd it's, of course, for your kids.
p275
aVAnd there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.
p276
aVAnd she still actually has those.
p277
aVSo I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise
p278
aVup in Boise, on a river, you know. So
p279
aVand then I started another company called Toy Innovation
p280
aVand we did some projects with Mattel with
p281
aVactually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,
p282
aVand we did Miracle Moves Baby,
p283
aVmade it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.
p284
aVAnd then I started another company.
p285
aVWe did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,
p286
aVwon "Best Innovations" at CES,
p287
aVbut really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,
p288
aVI just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,
p289
aVand I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,
p290
aVand then people started to want to do it.
p291
aVAnd they said they'd spend all this time.
p292
aVSo I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."
p293
aVThe crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur
p294
aVas much as we can with today's technology.
p295
aVAnd it's not really \u2014 but as close as we can do.
p296
aVAnd we're going to try to really pull this off,
p297
aVintentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.
p298
aVNot a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.
p299
aVSo I picked a Camarasaurus,
p300
aVbecause the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.
p301
aVAnd you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.
p302
aVThat's a juvenile.
p303
aVAnd so we actually went in.
p304
aVThere's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"
p305
aVwhere they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.
p306
aVAnd the picture from the book, so when I \u2014
p307
aVI told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.
p308
aVVery, very obsessive.
p309
aVThere's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,
p310
aVbut the geometry's correct.
p311
aVAnd then I went in, and measured all the geometry
p312
aVbecause I figured, hey, biomimicry.
p313
aVIf I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.
p314
aVSo there's the motor.
p315
aVAnd about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.
p316
aVHere's an example of what we did with the skull.
p317
aVThere's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.
p318
aVThere's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.
p319
aVThere's the mechanism that would go in there,
p320
aVkind of a Geneva drive.
p321
aVThere's some Solid Works versions of it.
p322
aVHere's some SLA parts of the same thing.
p323
aVAnd then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.
p324
aVThere's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.
p325
aVThere's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.
p326
aVAnd there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.
p327
aVThere's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,
p328
aVit has kind of a cuteness already.
p329
aVAnd the thing about blending science and art
p330
aVin this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,
p331
aVand then you go back and do the shape,
p332
aVand then you go back and forth.
p333
aVThe servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.
p334
aVThey had to fit within the envelope.
p335
aVThere was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.
p336
aVAll the neck and the tail are cable,
p337
aVso it moves smoothly and organically.
p338
aVAnd then, of course, you're not done yet.
p339
aVYou have to get the look for the skin.
p340
aVThe skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.
p341
aVSo you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel
p342
aVof the character.
p343
aVNow, this is not \u2014 we're character designers, right?
p344
aVAnd we're still trying to keep with the real character.
p345
aVSo, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.
p346
aVNow you start doing the sculpture for this.
p347
aVAnd you can see we got a guy from \u2014
p348
aVwho's just a fanatic about dinosaurs
p349
aVto do the sculpting for us,
p350
aVdown to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.
p351
aVAnd then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,
p352
aVand then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.
p353
aVAnd then, four years and 10 million dollars later,
p354
aVwe have a little Pleo.
p355
aVJohn, do you want to bring him up?
p356
aa(lp357
VJohn Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man
p358
aVthat's done most of the work with our 40-person company.
p359
aVI'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.
p360
aV(Applause)
p361
aVSo, thank you, John, thank you,
p362
aVand get back to work, all right, man?
p363
aVAll right \u2014
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aV\u2014 no, it's very painful, so \u2014
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aV\u2014 these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.
p368
aVThis \u2014 I on purpose \u2014 they go through life stages.
p369
aVSo when you first get them, they're babies.
p370
aVAnd you \u2014 more you have them, kind of the older they get,
p371
aVand they kind of learn through their behavior.
p372
aVSo this one, this one's actually asleep, and \u2014 hang on.
p373
aVPleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.
p374
aVSo this guy's listening to my voice here.
p375
aVBut they have 40 sensors all over their body.
p376
aVThey have seven processors, they have 14 motors,
p377
aVthey have \u2014
p378
aVbut you don't care, do you?
p379
aVThey're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.
p380
aVSo you see \u2014 hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?
p381
aVThere's something big and loud over here.
p382
aVHey.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVThat's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.
p385
aVYeah, they're like kids, you know.
p386
aVYou, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.
p387
aVI'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.
p388
aVHere, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.
p389
aV(Laughter)
p390
aVThere you go.
p391
aVThat's what the investors think, that it's just \u2014
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aV\u2014 right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.
p394
aVAnd we're hoping that \u2014 you know,
p395
aVour belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things
p396
aVin order to be more human.
p397
aVAnd we think we can help that out by having
p398
aVlittle creatures that you can love.
p399
aVNow these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.
p400
aVThey do change over time.
p401
aVBut mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.
p402
aVAnd we have a \u2014 I have a little something here.
p403
aVNow I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.
p404
aVWe've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.
p405
aVWe did include some things that are hopefully useful.
p406
aVExcuse me, Pleo.
p407
aVThey \u2014 he has a USB and he has a SD card,
p408
aVso it's completely open architecture.
p409
aVSo anyone can plug him \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you.
p410
aVThis is John over here.
p411
aVAnyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.
p412
aVYou can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a \u2014
p413
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p414
aVyou can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.
p415
aVKids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.
p416
aVWe \u2014 actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.
p417
aVWe have one animator who's taken it and
p418
aVhe's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,
p419
aVand they're going, "Whassup," you know?
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aVYou \u2014 so it's \u2014 yes, he likes that.
p422
aVSo they're a handful. We hope you get one.
p423
aVI don't know what I'm missing to say,
p424
aVbut as a last thing, I'd like to say is that
p425
aVif we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.
p426
aVAnd there's a lot of social responsibility in that.
p427
aVThat's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.
p428
aVAnd so I just \u2014 I hope we all dream well.
p429
aVThank you.
