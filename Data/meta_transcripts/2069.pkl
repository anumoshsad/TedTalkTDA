VSo in 1781, an English composer,
p4
aVtechnologist and astronomer called William Herschel
p5
aVnoticed an object on the sky that
p6
aVdidn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.
p7
aVAnd Herschel's recognition that something was different,
p8
aVthat something wasn't quite right,
p9
aVwas the discovery of a planet,
p10
aVthe planet Uranus,
p11
aVa name that has entertained
p12
aVcountless generations of children,
p13
aVbut a planet that overnight
p14
aVdoubled the size of our known solar system.
p15
aVJust last month, NASA announced the discovery
p16
aVof 517 new planets
p17
aVin orbit around nearby stars,
p18
aValmost doubling overnight the number of planets
p19
aVwe know about within our galaxy.
p20
aVSo astronomy is constantly being transformed by this
p21
aVcapacity to collect data,
p22
aVand with data almost doubling every year,
p23
aVwithin the next two decades, me may even
p24
aVreach the point for the first time in history
p25
aVwhere we've discovered the majority of the galaxies
p26
aVwithin the universe.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut as we enter this era of big data,
p29
aVwhat we're beginning to find is there's a difference
p30
aVbetween more data being just better
p31
aVand more data being different,
p32
aVcapable of changing the questions we want to ask,
p33
aVand this difference is not about how much data we collect,
p34
aVit's whether those data open new windows
p35
aVinto our universe,
p36
aVwhether they change the way we view the sky.
p37
aVSo what is the next window into our universe?
p38
aVWhat is the next chapter for astronomy?
p39
aVWell, I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies
p40
aVthat we're going to develop over the next decade,
p41
aVand how these technologies,
p42
aVtogether with the smart use of data,
p43
aVmay once again transform astronomy
p44
aVby opening up a window into our universe,
p45
aVthe window of time.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhy time? Well, time is about origins,
p48
aVand it's about evolution.
p49
aVThe origins of our solar system,
p50
aVhow our solar system came into being,
p51
aVis it unusual or special in any way?
p52
aVAbout the evolution of our universe.
p53
aVWhy our universe is continuing to expand,
p54
aVand what is this mysterious dark energy
p55
aVthat drives that expansion?
p56
aa(lp57
VBut first, I want to show you how technology
p58
aVis going to change the way we view the sky.
p59
aVSo imagine if you were sitting
p60
aVin the mountains of northern Chile
p61
aVlooking out to the west
p62
aVtowards the Pacific Ocean
p63
aVa few hours before sunrise.
p64
aVThis is the view of the night sky that you would see,
p65
aVand it's a beautiful view,
p66
aVwith the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.
p67
aVbut it's also a static view,
p68
aVand in many ways, this is the way we think of our universe:
p69
aVeternal and unchanging.
p70
aVBut the universe is anything but static.
p71
aVIt constantly changes on timescales of seconds
p72
aVto billions of years.
p73
aVGalaxies merge, they collide
p74
aVat hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.
p75
aVStars are born, they die,
p76
aVthey explode in these extravagant displays.
p77
aVIn fact, if we could go back
p78
aVto our tranquil skies above Chile,
p79
aVand we allow time to move forward
p80
aVto see how the sky might change over the next year,
p81
aVthe pulsations that you see
p82
aVare supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star
p83
aVexploding, brightening and then fading from view,
p84
aVeach one of these supernovae
p85
aVfive billion times the brightness of our sun,
p86
aVso we can see them to great distances
p87
aVbut only for a short amount of time.
p88
aVTen supernova per second explode somewhere
p89
aVin our universe.
p90
aVIf we could hear it,
p91
aVit would be popping like a bag of popcorn.
p92
aVNow, if we fade out the supernovae,
p93
aVit's not just brightness that changes.
p94
aVOur sky is in constant motion.
p95
aVThis swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky
p96
aVare asteroids as they orbit our sun,
p97
aVand it's these changes and the motion
p98
aVand it's the dynamics of the system
p99
aVthat allow us to build our models for our universe,
p100
aVto predict its future and to explain its past.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut the telescopes we've used over the last decade
p103
aVare not designed to capture the data at this scale.
p104
aVThe Hubble Space Telescope:
p105
aVfor the last 25 years it's been producing
p106
aVsome of the most detailed views
p107
aVof our distant universe,
p108
aVbut if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image
p109
aVof the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,
p110
aVabout 120 years to do this just once.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo this is driving us to new technologies
p113
aVand new telescopes,
p114
aVtelescopes that can go faint
p115
aVto look at the distant universe
p116
aVbut also telescopes that can go wide
p117
aVto capture the sky as rapidly as possible,
p118
aVtelescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,
p119
aVor the LSST,
p120
aVpossibly the most boring name ever
p121
aVfor one of the most fascinating experiments
p122
aVin the history of astronomy,
p123
aVin fact proof, if you should need it,
p124
aVthat you should never allow  a scientist or an engineer
p125
aVto name anything, not even your children. (Laughter)
p126
aVWe're building the LSST.
p127
aVWe expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade.
p128
aVI'm going to show you how we think
p129
aVit's going to transform  our views of the universe,
p130
aVbecause one image from the LSST
p131
aVis equivalent to 3,000 images
p132
aVfrom the Hubble Space Telescope,
p133
aVeach image three and a half degrees on the sky,
p134
aVseven times the width of the full moon.
p135
aVWell, how do you capture an image at this scale?
p136
aVWell, you build the largest digital camera in history,
p137
aVusing the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone
p138
aVor in the digital cameras you  can buy in the High Street,
p139
aVbut now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,
p140
aVabout the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,
p141
aVwhere one image is three billion pixels.
p142
aVSo if you wanted to look at an image
p143
aVin its full resolution, just a single LSST image,
p144
aVit would take about 1,500  high-definition TV screens.
p145
aVAnd this camera will image the sky,
p146
aVtaking a new picture every 20 seconds,
p147
aVconstantly scanning the sky
p148
aVso every three nights, we'll get a completely new view
p149
aVof the skies above Chile.
p150
aVOver the mission lifetime of this telescope,
p151
aVit will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,
p152
aVand that will be for the first time
p153
aVwe'll have detected more objects in our universe
p154
aVthan people on the Earth.
p155
aVNow, we can talk about this
p156
aVin terms of terabytes and petabytes
p157
aVand billions of objects,
p158
aVbut a way to get a sense of the amount of data
p159
aVthat will come off this camera
p160
aVis that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded
p161
aVsimultaneously, 24 hours a day,
p162
aVseven days a week, for 10 years.
p163
aVAnd to process this data means
p164
aVsearching through all of those talks
p165
aVfor every new idea and every new concept,
p166
aVlooking at each part of the video
p167
aVto see how one frame may have changed
p168
aVfrom the next.
p169
aVAnd this is changing the way that we do science,
p170
aVchanging the way that we do astronomy,
p171
aVto a place where software and algorithms
p172
aVhave to mine through this data,
p173
aVwhere the software is as critical to the science
p174
aVas the telescopes and the  cameras that we've built.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, thousands of discoveries
p177
aVwill come from this project,
p178
aVbut I'm just going to tell you about two
p179
aVof the ideas about origins and evolution
p180
aVthat may be transformed by our access
p181
aVto data at this scale.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn the last five years, NASA has discovered
p184
aVover 1,000 planetary systems
p185
aVaround nearby stars,
p186
aVbut the systems we're finding
p187
aVaren't much like our own solar system,
p188
aVand one of the questions we face is
p189
aVis it just that we haven't been looking hard enough
p190
aVor is there something special or unusual
p191
aVabout how our solar system formed?
p192
aVAnd if we want to answer that question,
p193
aVwe have to know and understand
p194
aVthe history of our solar system in detail,
p195
aVand it's the details that are crucial.
p196
aVSo now, if we look back at the sky,
p197
aVat our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,
p198
aVthese asteroids are like the debris of our solar system.
p199
aVThe positions of the asteroids
p200
aVare like a fingerprint of an earlier time
p201
aVwhen the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter
p202
aVwere much closer to the sun,
p203
aVand as these giant planets migrated through our solar system,
p204
aVthey were scattering the asteroids in their wake.
p205
aVSo studying the asteroids
p206
aVis like performing forensics,
p207
aVperforming forensics on our solar system,
p208
aVbut to do this, we need distance,
p209
aVand we get the distance from the motion,
p210
aVand we get the motion because of our access to time.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo what does this tell us?
p213
aVWell, if you look at the little yellow asteroids
p214
aVflitting across the screen,
p215
aVthese are the asteroids that are moving fastest,
p216
aVbecause they're closest to us, closest to Earth.
p217
aVThese are the asteroids we may one day
p218
aVsend spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,
p219
aVbut they're also the asteroids that may one day
p220
aVimpact the Earth,
p221
aVlike happened 60 million years ago
p222
aVwith the extinction of the dinosaurs,
p223
aVor just at the beginning of the last century,
p224
aVwhen an asteroid wiped out
p225
aValmost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,
p226
aVor even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,
p227
aVreleasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.
p228
aVSo studying the forensics of our solar system
p229
aVdoesn't just tell us about the past,
p230
aVit can also predict the future,  including our future.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow when we get distance,
p233
aVwe get to see the asteroids  in their natural habitat,
p234
aVin orbit around the sun.
p235
aVSo every point in this visualization that you can see
p236
aVis a real asteroid.
p237
aVIts orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky.
p238
aVThe colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,
p239
aVdry and stony in the center,
p240
aVwater-rich and primitive towards the edge,
p241
aVwater-rich asteroids which may have seeded
p242
aVthe oceans and the seas that we find on our planet
p243
aVwhen they bombarded the  Earth at an earlier time.
p244
aVBecause the LSST will be able to go faint
p245
aVand not just wide,
p246
aVwe will be able to see these asteroids
p247
aVfar beyond the inner part of our solar system,
p248
aVto asteroids beyond the  orbits of Neptune and Mars,
p249
aVto comets and asteroids that may exist
p250
aValmost a light year from our sun.
p251
aVAnd as we increase the detail of this picture,
p252
aVincreasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,
p253
aVwe will be able to answer questions such as,
p254
aVis there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune,
p255
aVto find Earth-impacting asteroids
p256
aVlong before they're a danger,
p257
aVand to find out whether, maybe,
p258
aVour sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,
p259
aVand maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings
p260
aVthat influenced the formation of our solar system,
p261
aVand maybe that's one of the reasons why  solar systems like ours seem to be so rare.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, distance and changes in our universe \u2014
p264
aVdistance equates to time,
p265
aVas well as changes on the sky.
p266
aVEvery foot of distance you look away,
p267
aVor every foot of distance an object is away,
p268
aVyou're looking back about a billionth of a second in time,
p269
aVand this idea or this notion of looking back in time
p270
aVhas revolutionized our ideas about the universe,
p271
aVnot once but multiple times.
p272
aa(lp273
VThe first time was in 1929,
p274
aVwhen an astronomer called Edwin Hubble
p275
aVshowed that the universe was expanding,
p276
aVleading to the ideas of the Big Bang.
p277
aVAnd the observations were simple:
p278
aVjust 24 galaxies
p279
aVand a hand-drawn picture.
p280
aVBut just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,
p281
aVthe faster it was receding,
p282
aVwas enough to give rise to modern cosmology.
p283
aa(lp284
VA second revolution happened 70 years later,
p285
aVwhen two groups of astronomers showed
p286
aVthat the universe wasn't just expanding,
p287
aVit was accelerating,
p288
aVa surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky
p289
aVand finding out the higher that it gets,
p290
aVthe faster it moves away.
p291
aVAnd they showed this
p292
aVby measuring the brightness of supernovae,
p293
aVand how the brightness of the supernovae
p294
aVgot fainter with distance.
p295
aVAnd these observations were more complex.
p296
aVThey required new technologies and new telescopes,
p297
aVbecause the supernovae were in galaxies
p298
aVthat were 2,000 times more distant
p299
aVthan the ones used by Hubble.
p300
aVAnd it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,
p301
aVbecause a supernova only explodes
p302
aVonce every hundred years within a galaxy.
p303
aVThree years to find 42 supernovae
p304
aVby searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.
p305
aVAnd once they'd collected their data,
p306
aVthis is what they found.
p307
aVNow, this may not look impressive,
p308
aVbut this is what a revolution in physics looks like:
p309
aVa line predicting the brightness of a supernova
p310
aV11 billion light years away,
p311
aVand a handful of points that don't quite fit that line.
p312
aa(lp313
VSmall changes give rise to big consequences.
p314
aVSmall changes allow us to make discoveries,
p315
aVlike the planet found by Herschel.
p316
aVSmall changes turn our understanding
p317
aVof the universe on its head.
p318
aVSo 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,
p319
aVmeaning slightly further away,
p320
aVrequiring that a universe must not just be expanding,
p321
aVbut this expansion must be accelerating,
p322
aVrevealing a component of our universe
p323
aVwhich we now call dark energy,
p324
aVa component that drives this expansion
p325
aVand makes up 68 percent of the energy budget
p326
aVof our universe today.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what is the next revolution likely to be?
p329
aVWell, what is dark energy and why does it exist?
p330
aVEach of these lines shows a different model
p331
aVfor what dark energy might be,
p332
aVshowing the properties of dark energy.
p333
aVThey all are consistent with the 42 points,
p334
aVbut the ideas behind these lines
p335
aVare dramatically different.
p336
aVSome people think about a dark energy
p337
aVthat changes with time,
p338
aVor whether the properties of the dark energy
p339
aVare different depending on where you look on the sky.
p340
aVOthers make differences and changes
p341
aVto the physics at the sub-atomic level.
p342
aVOr, they look at large scales
p343
aVand change how gravity and general relativity work,
p344
aVor they say our universe is just one of many,
p345
aVpart of this mysterious multiverse,
p346
aVbut all of these ideas, all of these theories,
p347
aVamazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,
p348
aVbut all of them consistent with our 42 points.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo how can we hope to make sense of this
p351
aVover the next decade?
p352
aVWell, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,
p353
aVand I said you wanted to see whether those dice
p354
aVwere loaded or fair.
p355
aVOne roll of the dice would tell you very little,
p356
aVbut the more times you rolled them,
p357
aVthe more data you collected,
p358
aVthe more confident you would become,
p359
aVnot just whether they're loaded or fair,
p360
aVbut by how much, and in what way.
p361
aVIt took three years to find just 42 supernovae
p362
aVbecause the telescopes that we built
p363
aVcould only survey a small part of the sky.
p364
aVWith the LSST, we get a completely new view
p365
aVof the skies above Chile every three nights.
p366
aVIn its first night of operation,
p367
aVit will find 10 times the number of supernovae
p368
aVused in the discovery of dark energy.
p369
aVThis will increase by 1,000
p370
aVwithin the first four months:
p371
aV1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,
p372
aVeach supernova a roll of the dice,
p373
aVeach supernova testing which theories of dark energy
p374
aVare consistent, and which ones are not.
p375
aVAnd so, by combining these supernova data
p376
aVwith other measures of cosmology,
p377
aVwe'll progressively rule out the different ideas
p378
aVand theories of dark energy
p379
aVuntil hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,
p380
aVwe would expect to hopefully see
p381
aVa theory for our universe,
p382
aVa fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,
p383
aVto gradually emerge.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, in many ways, the questions that I posed
p386
aVare in reality the simplest of questions.
p387
aVWe may not know the answers,
p388
aVbut we at least know how to ask the questions.
p389
aVBut if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies
p390
aVrevealed 42 supernovae that turned
p391
aVour understanding of the universe on its head,
p392
aVwhen we're working with billions of galaxies,
p393
aVhow many more times are we going to find
p394
aV42 points that don't quite match what we expect?
p395
aVLike the planet found by Herschel
p396
aVor dark energy
p397
aVor quantum mechanics or general relativity,
p398
aVall ideas that came because the data
p399
aVdidn't quite match what we expected.
p400
aVWhat's so exciting about the next decade of data
p401
aVin astronomy is,
p402
aVwe don't even know how many answers
p403
aVare out there waiting,
p404
aVanswers about our origins and our evolution.
p405
aVHow many answers are out there
p406
aVthat we don't even know the questions
p407
aVthat we want to ask?
p408
