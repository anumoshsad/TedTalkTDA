VInformation technology grows in an exponential manner.
p4
aVIt's not linear. And our intuition is linear.
p5
aVWhen we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago
p6
aVwe made linear predictions where that animal would be,
p7
aVand that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.
p8
aVBut the pace of exponential growth
p9
aVis really what describes information technologies.
p10
aVAnd it's not just computation.
p11
aVThere is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.
p12
aVIf I take 30 steps linearly \u2014 one, two, three, four, five \u2014
p13
aVI get to 30.
p14
aVIf I take 30 steps exponentially \u2014 two, four, eight, 16 \u2014
p15
aVI get to a billion.
p16
aVIt makes a huge difference.
p17
aVAnd that really describes information technology.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhen I was a student at MIT,
p20
aVwe all shared one computer that took up a whole building.
p21
aVThe computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,
p22
aVa million times smaller,
p23
aVa thousand times more powerful.
p24
aVThat's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar
p25
aVthat we've actually experienced since I was a student.
p26
aVAnd we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.
p27
aVInformation technology progresses
p28
aVthrough a series of S-curves
p29
aVwhere each one is a different paradigm.
p30
aVSo people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?"
p31
aVWhich will happen around 2020.
p32
aVWe'll then go to the next paradigm.
p33
aVAnd Moore's Law was not the first paradigm
p34
aVto bring exponential growth to computing.
p35
aVThe exponential growth of computing started
p36
aVdecades before Gordon Moore was even born.
p37
aVAnd it doesn't just apply to computation.
p38
aVIt's really any technology where we can measure
p39
aVthe underlying information properties.
p40
aa(lp41
VHere we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.
p42
aVThe logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,
p43
aVbecause this represents trillions-fold increase
p44
aVsince the 1890 census.
p45
aVIn 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,
p46
aVmaking them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;
p47
aVthey couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.
p48
aVAnd that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,
p49
aVbut it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.
p50
aVWe went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,
p51
aVand finally integrated circuits.
p52
aVWhen that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;
p53
aVthree-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut what's even more amazing, really, than this
p56
aVfantastic scale of progress,
p57
aVis that \u2014 look at how predictable this is.
p58
aVI mean this went through thick and thin,
p59
aVthrough war and peace, through boom times and recessions.
p60
aVThe Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.
p61
aVWe'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.
p62
aVAt least the exponential growth of information technology capability
p63
aVwill continue unabated.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd I just updated these graphs.
p66
aVBecause I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near."
p67
aVSo we updated them,
p68
aVso I could present it here, to 2007.
p69
aVAnd I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?
p70
aVMaybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."
p71
aVI was a little nervous
p72
aVbecause maybe the data wouldn't be right,
p73
aVbut I've done this now for 30 years,
p74
aVand it has stayed on this exponential progression.
p75
aa(lp76
VLook at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.
p77
aVYou can buy half a billion today,
p78
aVand they are actually better, because they are faster.
p79
aVBut look at how predictable this is.
p80
aVAnd I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.
p81
aVI've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.
p82
aVAnd the cost of a transistor cycle,
p83
aVwhich is a measure of the price performance of electronics,
p84
aVcomes down about every year.
p85
aVThat's a 50 percent deflation rate.
p86
aVAnd it's also true of other examples,
p87
aVlike DNA data or brain data.
p88
aVBut we more than make up for that.
p89
aVWe actually ship more than twice as much
p90
aVof every form of information technology.
p91
aVWe've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars
p92
aVin every form of information technology for the last half-century,
p93
aVdespite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is a completely different example.
p96
aVThis is not Moore's Law.
p97
aVThe amount of DNA data
p98
aVwe've sequenced has doubled every year.
p99
aVThe cost has come down by half every year.
p100
aVAnd this has been a smooth progression
p101
aVsince the beginning of the genome project.
p102
aVAnd halfway through the project, skeptics said,
p103
aV"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project
p104
aVand you've finished one percent of the project."
p105
aVBut that was really right on schedule.
p106
aVBecause if you double one percent seven more times,
p107
aVwhich is exactly what happened,
p108
aVyou get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.
p109
aa(lp110
VCommunication technologies:
p111
aV50 different ways to measure this,
p112
aVthe number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.
p113
aVBut this has progressed at an exponential pace.
p114
aVThis is deeply democratizing.
p115
aVI wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"
p116
aVwhen the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away
p117
aVby this growth of decentralized communication.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century
p120
aVto do things like simulate regions of the human brain.
p121
aVBut where will we get the software?
p122
aVSome critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."
p123
aVBut we are learning more and more about the human brain.
p124
aVSpatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
p125
aVThe amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.
p126
aVAnd we're showing that we can actually turn this data
p127
aVinto working models and simulations of brain regions.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,
p130
aVsimulated and tested:
p131
aVthe auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;
p132
aVcerebellum, where we do our skill formation;
p133
aVslices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.
p134
aVAnd all of this has fueled
p135
aVan increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.
p136
aVWe've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars
p137
aVin constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,
p138
aVfueled by this information technology.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd we're all concerned about energy and the environment.
p141
aVWell this is a logarithmic graph.
p142
aVThis represents a smooth doubling,
p143
aVevery two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,
p144
aVparticularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,
p145
aVa form of information technology, to solar panels.
p146
aVAnd we're only eight doublings away
p147
aVfrom it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.
p148
aVAnd there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.
p149
aa(lp150
VWe ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.
p151
aVWhen I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.
p152
aVWhat used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.
p153
aVWhat now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.
p154
aVAnd we will begin to actually deeply influence
p155
aVour health and our intelligence,
p156
aVas we get closer and closer to this technology.
p157
aa(lp158
VBased on that we are announcing, here at TED,
p159
aVin true TED tradition, Singularity University.
p160
aVIt's a new university
p161
aVthat's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,
p162
aVand myself.
p163
aVIt's backed by NASA and Google,
p164
aVand other leaders in the high-tech and science community.
p165
aVAnd our goal was to assemble the leaders,
p166
aVboth teachers and students,
p167
aVin these exponentially growing information technologies,
p168
aVand their application.
p169
aVBut Larry Page made an impassioned speech
p170
aVat our organizing meeting,
p171
aVsaying we should devote this study
p172
aVto actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.
p173
aVAnd if we did that, then Google would back this.
p174
aVAnd so that's what we've done.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe last third of the nine-week intensive summer session
p177
aVwill be devoted to a group project to address
p178
aVsome major challenge of humanity.
p179
aVLike for example, applying the Internet,
p180
aVwhich is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,
p181
aVto bringing health information
p182
aVto developing areas of the world.
p183
aVAnd these projects will continue past these sessions,
p184
aVusing collaborative interactive communication.
p185
aVAll the intellectual property that is created and taught
p186
aVwill be online and available,
p187
aVand developed online in a collaborative fashion.
p188
aa(lp189
VHere is our founding meeting.
p190
aVBut this is being announced today.
p191
aVIt will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,
p192
aVat the NASA Ames research center.
p193
aVThere are different programs for graduate students,
p194
aVfor executives at different companies.
p195
aVThe first six tracks here \u2014 artificial intelligence,
p196
aVadvanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology \u2014
p197
aVare the different core areas of information technology.
p198
aVThen we are going to apply them to the other areas,
p199
aVlike energy, ecology,
p200
aVpolicy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,
p201
aVso that people can bring these new technologies to the world.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten
p204
aVfrom both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,
p205
aVparticularly Google and NASA.
p206
aVThis is an exciting new venture.
p207
aVAnd we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.
