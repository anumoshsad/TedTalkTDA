VThis is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.
p4
aVShe was 105 years old when I took this picture.
p5
aVShe was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,
p6
aV"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVShe said, "Be good to your friends.
p9
aVWhy, without them, you'd be a total stranger."
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is one of her songs.
p13
aVLet's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.
p14
aVAnd I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.
p15
aVGive him a big old hand.
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aa(lp18
VOne, two, three, four.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Music)
p21
aa(lp22
VWell, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;
p23
aVif I don't see her, I go crazy.
p24
aa(lp25
VMy true love lives up the river;
p26
aVa few more jumps and I'll be with her.
p27
aa(lp28
VHey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!
p29
aVHey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.
p32
aVI'd go up and learn these old songs from her.
p33
aVShe couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.
p34
aVAnd I'd pull her out on the front porch.
p35
aVDown below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.
p36
aVA double outhouse over here on the side.
p37
aVAnd we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,
p38
aVso I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."
p39
aa(lp40
VOh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!
p41
aVHey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, she and I went blackberry picking.
p44
aVShe got mad; I took a licking.
p45
aa(lp46
VDucks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,
p47
aVDevil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.
p48
aa(lp49
VHey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!
p50
aVHey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.
p51
aa(lp52
VLet's have the banjo.
p53
aa(lp54
VWell, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.
p55
aVI'll lay around; she'll make a living.
p56
aa(lp57
VShe'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;
p58
aVwe'll have chicken someday, maybe.
p59
aa(lp60
VHey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!
p61
aa(lp62
VOne more time now.
p63
aVOh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!
p64
aVHey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aVThank you, Michael.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis is Ralph Stanley.
p70
aVWhen I was going to college at University of California
p71
aVat Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,
p72
aVtaking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.
p73
aVThis was in 1968, I guess it was.
p74
aVAnd he played his bluegrass style of music,
p75
aVbut near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking
p76
aVthat came from Africa, along with the banjo.
p77
aVIt's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.
p78
aVI fell in love with that.
p79
aVI went up to him and said, how can I learn that?
p80
aVHe said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,
p81
aVor Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina \u2014
p82
aVsome place that has a lot of music.
p83
aVBecause there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo I went back that very summer.
p86
aVI just fell in love with the culture and the people.
p87
aVAnd you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees
p88
aVand told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.
p89
aVYou can imagine how excited they were.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures
p92
aVI've taken of some of my mentors.
p93
aVJust a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.
p96
aV(Music)
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aVThose last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.
p100
aVHe was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.
p101
aVThe Old Jack tales that he had learned \u2014 he talked like this,
p102
aVyou could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.
p103
aVAnd he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.
p104
aVNo running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd you can look at more pictures.
p107
aVI've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done
p108
aVof some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.
p109
aVThis instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.
p110
aVIt is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,
p111
aVand still played in the Southern mountains.
p112
aVNow, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.
p113
aVThey would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.
p114
aVIt was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
p115
aVIt sounds something like this.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Music)
p118
aVWell, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy
p119
aVabout the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?
p120
aa(lp121
VYou take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
p122
aVYou take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, they were scouts in the rebels' army,
p125
aVthey were known both far and wide.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhen the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.
p128
aa(lp129
VYou take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
p130
aVYou take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
p131
aa(lp132
VAin't that a sound?
p133
aV(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VWell, it was 1954, I guess it was.
p136
aVWe were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,
p137
aVwhere I grew up in the early part of my life.
p138
aVOutside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.
p139
aVMy mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.
p140
aVWe were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.
p141
aVWe were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.
p142
aVYou see, we'd just been to the grocery store,
p143
aVand my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine
p144
aVthat had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.
p145
aVAnd, buddy, that made us mad.
p146
aVWell, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,
p147
aV"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.
p148
aVYou don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.
p149
aVYou think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.
p150
aVYou boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."
p151
aa(lp152
VShe pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car."
p153
aVMy brother and I stepped out of the car.
p154
aVWe were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.
p155
aVThere were about a hundred black folks out there picking.
p156
aVMy mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.
p157
aVShe went up to the foreman; she said,
p158
aV"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."
p159
aVOf course, we were just eight and 10.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVShe said, "Would you put them to work?"
p162
aVWell, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:
p163
aVput these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field
p164
aVin August in Texas \u2014 it's hot.
p165
aVSo he gave us each a cotton sack,
p166
aVabout 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.
p167
aVNow, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.
p168
aVAnd if you don't know what you're doing,
p169
aVyour hands are bleeding in no time.
p170
aVAnd my brother and I started to pick it,
p171
aVand our hands were startin' to bleed, and then \u2014 "Mom!"
p172
aVAnd Mom was just sitting by the car like this.
p173
aVShe wasn't going to give up.
p174
aa(lp175
VWell, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.
p176
aVHe kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.
p177
aVHe just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
p178
aVDon't want it to leave me behind.
p179
aVWell, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
p180
aVDon't want it to leave me behind."
p181
aVAnd from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:
p182
aV"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.
p183
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p184
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p185
aVAnd I don't want it to leave me behind."
p186
aVNow, my brother and I had never heard anything like that
p187
aVin our whole lives. It was so beautiful.
p188
aVWe sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,
p189
aVwithout crying, while they sang things like:
p190
aV"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"
p191
aVand "I done done," "This little light of mine."
p192
aa(lp193
VFinally, by the end of the day,
p194
aVwe'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.
p195
aVBut the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,
p196
aVbut my mother would never let us cash it.
p197
aVI'm 57; still have the check.
p198
aVNow, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.
p199
aVBut if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.
p200
aVNo, we learned something else.
p201
aVThe first thing I learned that day
p202
aVwas that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVAnd pretty much never did.
p205
aVBut I also learned that some people in this world
p206
aVdo have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.
p207
aVAnd I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
p208
aVAnd it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day
p211
aVwhen my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.
p212
aVI wasn't even aware of music \u2014 not even aware of it.
p213
aVBut that day in the cotton field out there picking,
p214
aVwhen those people started singing,
p215
aVI realized I was in the very heart of real music,
p216
aVand that's where I've wanted to be ever since.
p217
aa(lp218
VTry this old song with me. I sing:
p219
aVWell, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
p220
aa(lp221
VYou sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.
p222
aVWell, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
p223
aVDon't want it to leave me behind.
p224
aa(lp225
VGood news, good news: Chariot's coming.
p226
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p227
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p228
aVAnd I don't want it to leave me \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
VIt's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?
p231
aVLet's try it one more time.
p232
aa(lp233
VThere's a starry crown in heaven, I know.
p234
aVDon't want it to leave me behind.
p235
aVThere's a starry crown in heaven, I know.
p236
aVDon't want it to leave me behind.
p237
aa(lp238
VGood news: Chariot's coming.
p239
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p240
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p241
aVAnd I don't want it to leave me behind.
p242
aa(lp243
VIt was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,
p244
aVand I told it at a concert.
p245
aVMy mom was in the audience.
p246
aVAfter the \u2014 she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,
p247
aVbut after the concert she came up and she said,
p248
aV"David, I've got to tell you something.
p249
aVI set that whole thing up.
p250
aVI set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.
p251
aVI just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.
p252
aVI didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."
p253
aa(lp254
VLet's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.
p255
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p256
aVGood news: Chariot's coming.
p257
aVAnd I don't want it to leave me behind.
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VWell, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.
p261
aVIt was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,
p262
aVwho later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument
p263
aVwith a metal cone for \u2014 where the sound comes from.
p264
aVIt's usually played flat on your lap.
p265
aVIt was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,
p266
aVbefore they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.
p267
aVAnd then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,
p268
aVjust like that \u2014 a nice Merlot works very well.
p269
aVThat wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.
p270
aVBreak it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.
p271
aVThis instrument pretty much saved my life.
p272
aa(lp273
VFifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,
p274
aVmy wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,
p275
aVand it was the most \u2014 it almost took me out \u2014 it almost took me out of this world.
p276
aVAnd I think I learned a lot about what happiness was
p277
aVby going through such unbelievable grief,
p278
aVjust standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.
p279
aVI had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.
p280
aVI had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;
p281
aVI was ready to check out of this world.
p282
aVAnd you know, at the top of the list, of course,
p283
aVwere Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents \u2014 I didn't want to hurt them.
p284
aVBut then, when I thought about it beyond that,
p285
aVit was very simple things.
p286
aVI didn't care about \u2014 I had a radio show,
p287
aVI have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"
p288
aVI didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.
p289
aVNothing. Nothing.
p290
aVOn the list it would be stuff like,
p291
aVseeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,
p292
aVcatching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,
p293
aVthe sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,
p294
aVlistening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.
p295
aVAnd for me, the sound of a steel guitar,
p296
aVbecause one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.
p297
aVAnd I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,
p298
aVbut I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.
p299
aVAnd it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,
p300
aVthat would really make that connection.
p301
aVThis is a song that came out of that.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Music)
p304
aVWell, I hear you're having trouble.
p305
aVLord, I hate to hear that news.
p306
aVIf you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.
p307
aa(lp308
VWords no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.
p309
aVI just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.
p310
aa(lp311
VPeople say, "Oh, snap out of it!"
p312
aVOh yeah, that's easier said than done.
p313
aVWhile you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.
p314
aa(lp315
VSometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood
p316
aV'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, you can try to keep it all inside
p319
aVwith drink and drugs and cigarettes,
p320
aVbut you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.
p323
aVCall me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.
p324
aVOpen up now.
p325
aV(Applause)
p326
aa(lp327
VOh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.
p328
aVWe moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.
p329
aVAnd he was working on gyroscopes;
p330
aVhe has a number of patents for that kind of thing.
p331
aVAnd we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.
p332
aVThey were about my age.
p333
aVJohn went on, and Michael did too,
p334
aVto become some of the inventors of computer animation.
p335
aVMichael's dad was working on something called the computer.
p336
aVThis was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;
p337
aVI didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,
p338
aVyou know, what they were making. It was like a library,
p339
aVjust full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,
p340
aVjust floors and floors of these things,
p341
aVand one of the engineers said,
p342
aVsome day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.
p343
aVI thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VSo that Christmas \u2014 maybe I've got time for this \u2014
p347
aVthat Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.
p348
aVWell, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.
p349
aVHis great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,
p350
aVthe inventor of the cotton gin.
p351
aVSo we looked in that \u2014
p352
aVthis was a commercial chemistry set.
p353
aVIt had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:
p354
aVsulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.
p355
aVMan, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.
p356
aVWe made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway
p357
aVand we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.
p358
aa(lp359
VWell, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.
p360
aVSo we went over into Michael's garage \u2014
p361
aVhis dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,
p362
aVand screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,
p363
aVdrilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,
p364
aVpulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,
p365
aVand \u2014 down in that hole \u2014 and then stuffed some of our gunpowder
p366
aVdown that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVWe weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.
p369
aVWe stood back, we lit that thing,
p370
aVand they flew out of there \u2014 they went through that plywood like it was paper.
p371
aVThrough the garage.
p372
aVTwo of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aVWe tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.
p375
aVThat was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.
p376
aa(lp377
VWell, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.
p378
aVHe and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.
p379
aVThey said they were going to beat us up
p380
aVif we didn't make some gunpowder for them.
p381
aVWe said, well, what are you going to do with it?
p382
aVThey said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVSure. We'll make you a big batch.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aVSo we made them a big batch, and it was in my \u2014
p387
aVnow, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.
p388
aVMom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.
p389
aVIt became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.
p390
aVMichael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.
p391
aVHe said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.
p392
aVNo problem. Yeah, you know."
p393
aVIt just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.
p394
aVNo hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.
p395
aVThere were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;
p396
aVthe air was the just full of black smoke.
p397
aVShe came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
p398
aVBut we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise
p399
aVit made \u2014 tasted faintly of gunpowder.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo I like to invent things too,
p402
aVand I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.
p403
aVWhen drum machines were new, I got to thinking,
p404
aVwhy couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,
p405
aVand combine it with the newest technology?
p406
aVI call this Thunderwear.
p407
