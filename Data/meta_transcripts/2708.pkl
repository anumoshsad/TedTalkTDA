VFor several years now,
p4
aVwe've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus.
p5
aVNo question \u2014
p6
aVit's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent,
p7
aVbut that's where the conversation about sex is ending.
p8
aVAnd in that vacuum of information
p9
aVthe media and the Internet \u2014
p10
aVthat new digital street corner \u2014
p11
aVare educating our kids for us.
p12
aVIf we truly want young people to engage safely, ethically,
p13
aVand yes, enjoyably,
p14
aVit's time to have open honest discussion about what happens after "yes,"
p15
aVand that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all
p16
aVand talking to young people
p17
aVabout women's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure.
p18
aVYeah.
p19

p21
aa(lp22
VCome on, ladies.
p23
aa(lp24

p25
aa(lp26
VI spent three years talking to girls ages 15 to 20
p27
aVabout their attitudes and experience of sex.
p28
aVAnd what I found was
p29
aVthat while young women may feel entitled to engage in sexual behavior,
p30
aVthey don't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it.
p31
aVTake this sophomore at the Ivy League college
p32
aVwho told me,
p33
aV"I come from a long line of smart, strong women.
p34
aVMy grandmother was a firecracker,
p35
aVmy mom is a professional,
p36
aVmy sister and I are loud, and that's our form of feminine power."
p37
aVShe then proceeded to describe her sex life to me:
p38
aVa series of one-off hookups,
p39
aVstarting when she was 13,
p40
aVthat were ...
p41
aVnot especially responsible,
p42
aVnot especially reciprocal
p43
aVand not especially enjoyable.
p44
aVShe shrugged.
p45
aV"I guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures
p46
aVwho don't express our wants or needs."
p47
aV"Wait a minute," I replied.
p48
aV"Didn't you just tell me what a smart, strong woman you are?"
p49
aVShe hemmed and hawed.
p50
aV"I guess," she finally said,
p51
aV"no one told me that that smart, strong image applies to sex."
p52
aa(lp53
VI should probably say right up top that despite the hype,
p54
aVteenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age
p55
aVthan they were 25 years ago.
p56
aVThey are, however, engaging in other behavior.
p57
aVAnd when we ignore that,
p58
aVwhen we label that as "not sex,"
p59
aVthat opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect.
p60
aVThat's particularly true of oral sex,
p61
aVwhich teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse.
p62
aVGirls would tell me, "it's no big deal,"
p63
aVlike they'd all read the same instruction manual \u2014
p64
aVat least if boys were on the receiving end.
p65
aVYoung women have lots of reasons for participating.
p66
aVIt made them feel desired;
p67
aVit was a way to boost social status.
p68
aVSometimes, it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation.
p69
aVAs a freshman at a West Coast college said to me,
p70
aV"A girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night
p71
aVbecause she doesn't want to have sex with him,
p72
aVand he expects to be satisfied.
p73
aVSo, if I want him to leave
p74
aVand I don't want anything to happen ... "
p75
aVI heard so many stories of girls performing one-sided oral sex
p76
aVthat I started asking,
p77
aV"What if every time you were alone with a guy,
p78
aVhe told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen,
p79
aVand he never got you a glass of water \u2014
p80
aVor if he did, it was like ...
p81
aV'you want me to uh ...?'"
p82
aVYou know, totally begrudging.
p83
aVYou wouldn't stand for it.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut it wasn't always that boys didn't want to.
p86
aVIt was that girls didn't want them to.
p87
aVGirls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals.
p88
aVA sense that they were simultaneously icky and sacred.
p89
aVWomen's feelings about their genitals
p90
aVhave been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex.
p91
aVYet, Debby Herbenick, a researcher at Indiana University,
p92
aVbelieves that girls' genital self-image is under siege,
p93
aVwith more pressure than ever
p94
aVto see them as unacceptable in their natural state.
p95
aVAccording to research,
p96
aVabout three-quarters of college women remove their pubic hair \u2014 all of it \u2014
p97
aVat least on occasion,
p98
aVand more than half do so regularly.
p99
aVGirls would tell me that hair removal made them feel cleaner,
p100
aVthat it was a personal choice.
p101
aVThough, I kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island,
p102
aVif this was how they would choose to spend their time.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd when I pushed further,
p107
aVa darker motivation emerged:
p108
aVavoiding humiliation.
p109
aV"Guys act like they would be disgusted by it,"
p110
aVone young woman told me.
p111
aV"No one wants to be talked about like that."
p112
aVThe rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s,
p113
aVwhen women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs.
p114
aVThat's when flapper dresses came into style,
p115
aVand women's limbs were suddenly visible,
p116
aVopen to public scrutiny.
p117
aVThere's a way that I think that this too is a sign.
p118
aVThat a girl's most intimate part is open to public scrutiny,
p119
aVopen to critique,
p120
aVto becoming more about how it looks to someone else
p121
aVthan how it feels to her.
p122
aa(lp123
VThe shaving trend has sparked another rise in labiaplasty.
p124
aVLabiaplasty, which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia,
p125
aVis the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery among teenage girls.
p126
aVIt rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,
p127
aVand whereas girls under 18 comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries,
p128
aVthey are five percent of labiaplasty.
p129
aVThe most sought-after look, incidentally,
p130
aVin which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell,
p131
aVis called ...
p132
aVwait for it ...
p133
aV"The Barbie."
p134
aa(lp135
V(Groan)
p136
aa(lp137
VI trust I don't have to tell you
p138
aVthat Barbie is a) made of plastic
p139
aVand b) has no genitalia.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThe labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome
p144
aVthat the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
p145
aVhas issued a statement on the procedure,
p146
aVwhich is rarely medically indicated,
p147
aVhas not been proven safe
p148
aVand whose side effects include scarring, numbness, pain
p149
aVand diminished sexual sensation.
p150
aVNow, admittedly,
p151
aVand blessedly,
p152
aVthe number of girls involved is still quite small,
p153
aVbut you could see them as canaries in a coal mine,
p154
aVtelling us something important about the way girls see their bodies.
p155
aa(lp156
VSara McClelland,
p157
aVa psychologist at the University of Michigan,
p158
aVcoined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this:
p159
aV"Intimate justice."
p160
aVThat's the idea that sex has political, as well as personal implications,
p161
aVjust like, who does the dishes in your house,
p162
aVor who vacuums the rug.
p163
aVAnd it raises similar issues about inequality,
p164
aVabout economic disparity,
p165
aVviolence,
p166
aVphysical and mental health.
p167
aVIntimate justice asks us to consider
p168
aVwho is entitled to engage in an experience.
p169
aVWho is entitled to enjoy it?
p170
aVWho is the primary beneficiary?
p171
aVAnd how does each partner define "good enough"?
p172
aVHonestly, I think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic
p173
aVfor adult women to confront,
p174
aVbut when we're talking about girls,
p175
aVI just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience
p176
aVshouldn't have to be something that they get over.
p177
aa(lp178
VIn her work,
p179
aVMcClelland found that young women were more likely than young men
p180
aVto use their partner's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction.
p181
aVSo they'd say things like,
p182
aV"If he's sexually satisfied,
p183
aVthen I'm sexually satisfied."
p184
aVYoung men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm.
p185
aVYoung women also defined bad sex differently.
p186
aVIn the largest ever survey
p187
aVever conducted on American sexual behavior,
p188
aVthey reported pain in their sexual encounters
p189
aV30 percent of the time.
p190
aVThey also used words like "depressing,"
p191
aV"humiliating,"
p192
aV"degrading."
p193
aVThe young men never used that language.
p194
aVSo when young women report sexual satisfaction levels
p195
aVthat are equal to or greater than young men's \u2014
p196
aVand they do in research \u2014
p197
aVthat can be deceptive.
p198
aVIf a girl goes into an encounter hoping that it won't hurt,
p199
aVwanting to feel close to her partner
p200
aVand expecting him to have an orgasm,
p201
aVshe'll be satisfied if those criteria are met.
p202
aVAnd there's nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner,
p203
aVor wanting him to be happy,
p204
aVand orgasm isn't the only measure of an experience ...
p205
aVbut absence of pain \u2014
p206
aVthat's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment.
p207
aa(lp208
VListening to all of this and thinking about it,
p209
aVI began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological clitoridectomy
p210
aVon American girls.
p211
aVStarting in infancy,
p212
aVparents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts,
p213
aVat least they'll say, "here's your pee-pee."
p214
aVParents of baby girls go right from navel to knees,
p215
aVand they leave this whole situation in here unnamed.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThere's no better way to make something unspeakable
p220
aVthan not to name it.
p221
aVThen kids go into their puberty education classes
p222
aVand they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations,
p223
aVand girls have ...
p224
aVperiods and unwanted pregnancy.
p225
aVAnd they see that internal diagram of a woman's reproductive system \u2014
p226
aVyou know, the one that looks kind of like a steer head \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd it always grays out between the legs.
p231
aVSo we never say vulva,
p232
aVwe certainly never say clitoris.
p233
aVNo surprise,
p234
aVfewer than half of teenage girls age 14 to 17
p235
aVhave ever masturbated.
p236
aVAnd then they go into their partnered experience
p237
aVand we expect that somehow they'll think sex is about them,
p238
aVthat they'll be able to articulate their needs, their desires, their limits.
p239
aVIt's unrealistic.
p240
aa(lp241
VHere's something, though.
p242
aVGirls' investment in their partner's pleasure remains
p243
aVregardless of the gender of the partner.
p244
aVSo in same-sex encounters,
p245
aVthe orgasm gap disappears.
p246
aVAnd young women climax at the same rate as men.
p247
aVLesbian and bisexual girls would tell me
p248
aVthat they felt liberated to get off the script \u2014
p249
aVfree to create an encounter that worked for them.
p250
aVGay girls also challenged the idea of first intercourse
p251
aVas the definition of virginity.
p252
aVNot because intercourse isn't a big deal,
p253
aVbut it's worth questioning why we consider this one act,
p254
aVwhich most girls associate with discomfort or pain,
p255
aVto be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood \u2014
p256
aVso much more meaningful,
p257
aVso much more transformative than anything else.
p258
aVAnd it's worth considering how this is serving girls;
p259
aVwhether it's keeping them safer from disease,
p260
aVcoercion, betrayal, assault.
p261
aVWhether it's encouraging mutuality and caring;
p262
aVwhat it means about the way they see other sex acts;
p263
aVwhether it's giving them more control over
p264
aVand joy in their experience,
p265
aVand what it means about gay teens,
p266
aVwho can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse.
p267
aVSo I asked a gay girl that I met,
p268
aV"How'd you know you weren't a virgin anymore?"
p269
aVShe said she had to Google it.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd Google wasn't sure.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VShe finally decided that she wasn't a virgin anymore
p278
aVafter she'd had her first orgasm with a partner.
p279
aVAnd I thought \u2014
p280
aVwhoa.
p281
aVWhat if just for a second
p282
aVwe imagined that was the definition?
p283
aVAgain, not because intercourse isn't a big deal \u2014
p284
aVof course it is \u2014
p285
aVbut it isn't the only big deal,
p286
aVand rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal,
p287
aVthis helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences
p288
aVthat include warmth, affection, arousal,
p289
aVdesire, touch, intimacy.
p290
aVAnd it's worth asking young people:
p291
aVwho's really the more sexually experienced person?
p292
aVThe one who makes out with a partner for three hours
p293
aVand experiments with sensual tension and communication,
p294
aVor the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random
p295
aVin order to dump their "virginity" before they get to college?
p296
aa(lp297
VThe only way that shift in thinking can happen though
p298
aVis if we talk to young people more about sex \u2014
p299
aVif we normalize those discussions,
p300
aVintegrating them into everyday life,
p301
aVtalking about those intimate acts in a different way \u2014
p302
aVthe way we mostly have changed
p303
aVin the way that we talk about women in the public realm.
p304
aa(lp305
VConsider a survey of 300 randomly chosen girls
p306
aVfrom a Dutch and an American university,
p307
aVtwo similar universities,
p308
aVtalking about their early experience of sex.
p309
aVThe Dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls.
p310
aVThey had fewer negative consequences,
p311
aVlike disease, pregnancy, regret \u2014
p312
aVmore positive outcomes
p313
aVlike being able to communicate with their partner,
p314
aVwho they said they knew very well;
p315
aVpreparing for the experience responsibly;
p316
aVenjoying themselves.
p317
aVWhat was their secret?
p318
aVThe Dutch girls said that their doctors, teachers and parents
p319
aVtalked to them candidly,
p320
aVfrom an early age,
p321
aVabout sex, pleasure and the importance of mutual trust.
p322
aVWhat's more,
p323
aVwhile American parents weren't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex,
p324
aVwe tend to frame those conversations
p325
aVentirely in terms or risk and danger,
p326
aVwhereas Dutch parents talk about balancing responsibility and joy.
p327
aVI have to tell you,
p328
aVas a parent myself,
p329
aVthat hit me hard,
p330
aVbecause I know,
p331
aVhad I not delved into that research,
p332
aVI would have talked to my own child about contraception,
p333
aVabout disease protection,
p334
aVabout consent because I'm a modern parent,
p335
aVand I would have thought ...
p336
aVjob well done.
p337
aa(lp338
VNow I know that's not enough.
p339
aVI also know what I hope for for our girls.
p340
aVI want them to see sexuality as a source of self-knowledge,
p341
aVcreativity and communication,
p342
aVdespite its potential risks.
p343
aVI want them to be able to revel in their bodies' sensuality
p344
aVwithout being reduced to it.
p345
aVI want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed,
p346
aVand to get it.
p347
aVI want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy,
p348
aVdisease,
p349
aVcruelty,
p350
aVdehumanization,
p351
aVviolence.
p352
aVIf they are assaulted,
p353
aVI want them to have recourse from their schools,
p354
aVtheir employers,
p355
aVthe courts.
p356
aVIt's a lot to ask,
p357
aVbut it's not too much.
p358
aa(lp359
VAs parents, teachers, advocates and activists,
p360
aVwe have raised a generation of girls to have a voice,
p361
aVto expect egalitarian treatment in the home,
p362
aVin the classroom,
p363
aVin the workplace.
p364
aVNow it's time to demand that intimate justice
p365
aVin their personal lives as well.
p366
