VI was asked to come here and speak about creation.
p4
aVAnd I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.
p5
aVAnd I can \u2014 in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,
p6
aVwhich I call "creativity."
p7
aVCreativity is how we cope with creation.
p8
aVWhile creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,
p9
aVcreativity is always meaningful.
p10
aVSee, for instance, in this picture.
p11
aVYou know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,
p12
aVand creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhen you think about \u2014 you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.
p15
aVYou know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
p16
aVI just did things.
p17
aVThen I became an adult and started knowing who I was,
p18
aVand tried to maintain that persona \u2014 I became creative.
p19
aVIt wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly \u2014
p20
aVlooks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties \u2014
p21
aVthey followed a straight line that brings me to the point
p22
aVthat actually I'm talking to you at this moment.
p23
aVThough it's actually true, you know,
p24
aVthe reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
p25
aVIf I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.
p26
aa(lp27
VYou know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s
p28
aVunder a climate of political distress,
p29
aVand I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way \u2014
p30
aVin a sort of a semiotic black market.
p31
aVYou couldn't really say what you wanted to say;
p32
aVyou had to invent ways of doing it.
p33
aVYou didn't trust information very much.
p34
aVThat led me to another step of why I'm here today,
p35
aVis because I really liked media of all kinds.
p36
aVI was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.
p37
aVMy first job in Brazil
p38
aVwas actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,
p39
aVand based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.
p40
aVIt was very \u2014 actually, it was a very good study,
p41
aVand got me a job in an ad agency.
p42
aVAnd they also decided that I had to \u2014
p43
aVto give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd another point \u2014 why I'm here \u2014
p46
aVis that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,
p47
aVI rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,
p48
aVpicked the thing \u2014 didn't have any friends.
p49
aVOn my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
p50
aVSomebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
p51
aVThey were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.
p52
aVAnd also \u2014 advertising people do that all the time \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p53
aVand I \u2014 well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,
p54
aVthe guy who got hit decided to grab a gun \u2014
p55
aVI don't know why he had a gun \u2014
p56
aVand shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.
p57
aVThe first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.
p58
aVLuckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
p59
aVAnd, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry
p60
aVand I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.
p61
aVAnd that's how \u2014 with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,
p62
aVand that's very \u2014 the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:
p63
aVbecause I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.
p66
aVYou know, I became \u2014 I took this very iconoclastic approach.
p67
aVBecause when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do \u2014
p68
aVI wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,
p69
aVthat's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)
p70
aVBut I \u2014 they didn't let me do it, so I just \u2014 you know,
p71
aVthey would only let me do other things.
p72
aVBut I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
p73
aVThe first works were actually objects.
p74
aVIt was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.
p75
aVAnd I called them relics.
p76
aVThey were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis is the clown skull.
p79
aVIs a remnant of a race of \u2014 a very evolved race of entertainers.
p80
aVThey lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)
p81
aVThis is the Ashanti joystick.
p82
aVUnfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
p83
aVA Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
p84
aVThe rocking podium. (Laughter)
p85
aVThis is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)
p86
aVActually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,
p87
aVthat I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;
p88
aVthe coffee was actually pre-Columbian.
p89
aVThe Bonsai table.
p90
aVThe entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.
p91
aVAnd the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.
p92
aa(lp93
VI wanted to take that into the realm of images,
p94
aVand I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
p95
aVSo I decided to do work with clouds.
p96
aVBecause clouds can mean anything you want.
p97
aVBut now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,
p98
aVso something that would mean at the same time
p99
aVa lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands \u2014
p100
aValthough this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
p101
aVBut I was still, you know \u2014 this is a kitty cloud.
p102
aVThey're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.
p103
aV"The Snail."
p104
aVBut I was still working with sculpture,
p105
aVand I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.
p106
aV"The Teapot."
p107
aa(lp108
VI had a chance to go to Florence, in \u2014 I think it was '94,
p109
aVand I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."
p110
aVAnd he did something that was very tricky.
p111
aVHe put together two different media from different periods of time.
p112
aVFirst, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,
p113
aVand he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.
p114
aVAnd it's totally overkill.
p115
aVAnd your eye doesn't know which level to read.
p116
aVAnd you become trapped into this kind of representation.
p117
aVSo I decided to make these very simple renderings,
p118
aVthat at first they are taken as a line drawing \u2014
p119
aVyou know, something that's very \u2014 and then I did it with wire.
p120
aVThe idea was to \u2014 because everybody overlooks white \u2014 like pencil drawings, you know?
p121
aVAnd they would look at it \u2014 "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."
p122
aVThen you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.
p123
aVIt had a physicality,
p124
aVand you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative
p125
aVthat goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica."
p126
aV"Relaxation."
p127
aV"Fiat Lux."
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd the same way the history of representation
p130
aVevolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
p131
aVAnd I wanted to deal with other subjects.
p132
aVI started taking that into the realm of landscape,
p133
aVwhich is something that's almost a picture of nothing.
p134
aVI made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,"
p135
aVand I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.
p136
aVThese always end up being a photograph at the end,
p137
aVor more like an etching in this case.
p138
aVSo this is a lighthouse.
p139
aVThis is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.
p140
aVAnd I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.
p141
aa(lp142
VDeparting from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,
p143
aVlike which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.
p144
aVI had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,
p145
aVand I did work and play with them.
p146
aVI got some photographs from them.
p147
aVUpon my arrival in New York, I decided \u2014
p148
aVthey were children of sugar plantation workers.
p149
aVAnd by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.
p150
aVThese are \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p151
aVThank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."
p152
aVIt was just the name of the child,
p153
aVwith the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
p154
aV"Valicia."
p155
aV"Jacynthe."
p156
aa(lp157
VBut another layer of representation was still introduced.
p158
aVBecause I was doing this while I was making these pictures,
p159
aVI realized that I could add still another thing
p160
aVI was trying to make a subject \u2014
p161
aVsomething that would interfere with the themes,
p162
aVso chocolate is very good, because it has \u2014
p163
aVit brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
p164
aVAnd so I decided to make these pictures,
p165
aVand they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.
p166
aVSo they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
p167
aVFreud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.
p168
aVAnd Jackson Pollock also.
p169
aa(lp170
VPictures of crowds are particularly interesting,
p171
aVbecause, you know, you go to that \u2014
p172
aVyou try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,
p173
aVlike a face, goes into becoming just a texture.
p174
aV"Paparazzi."
p175
aVI used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.
p176
aVAnd I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.
p177
aVAnd you render this with the most non-specific material,
p178
aVwhich is dust itself.
p179
aVLike, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.
p180
aVThey do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.
p181
aVThis is Richard Serra.
p182
aa(lp183
VI bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
p184
aVYou know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?
p185
aVAnd I realized that I never worked with color,
p186
aVbecause I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.
p187
aVBut once they're applied to numeric structure,
p188
aVthen you can feel more comfortable.
p189
aVSo the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.
p190
aVThey end up being very large pictures,
p191
aVand I photographed with a very large camera \u2014
p192
aVan 8x10 camera.
p193
aVSo you can see the surface of every single swatch \u2014
p194
aVlike in this picture of Chuck Close.
p195
aVAnd you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
p196
aVAlso, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts \u2014
p197
aVand the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,
p198
aVwhich is the bit map.
p199
aVI ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."
p200
aa(lp201
VThis is something I used to do as a joke \u2014
p202
aVyou know, make \u2014 the same like \u2014 Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" \u2014
p203
aVand then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.
p204
aVI tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.
p205
aVBut then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship
p206
aVbetween the model and the original.
p207
aVAnd I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.
p208
aVI opt for very simple line drawings \u2014 kind of stupid looking.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,
p211
aVbeing 150 meters away.
p212
aVNow I would do very small ones, which would be like \u2014
p213
aVbut under the same light, and I would show them together,
p214
aVso the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.
p215
aVI wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.
p216
aVI was more interested in the things in between,
p217
aVyou know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
p218
aVThis is like you see \u2014 the size of a person over there.
p219
aVThis is a pipe.
p220
aVA hanger.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd this is another thing that I did \u2014 you know working
p223
aV\u2014 everybody loves to watch somebody draw,
p224
aVbut not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in \u2014
p225
aVa lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.
p226
aVAnd I love this work,
p227
aVbecause I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
p228
aVAnd it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest \u2014 an early interest \u2014 in theater,
p229
aVthat's justified on this thing.
p230
aVIn theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,
p231
aVtrying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.
p232
aVAnd in this, you'd have like a \u2014
p233
aVsomething that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.
p234
aVSo they're like perfect actors.
p235
aa(lp236
VMy interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.
p237
aVActually, I once paid like 60 dollars
p238
aVto see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,"
p239
aVand I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,
p240
aVhe stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
p241
aVOn the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think \u2014
p242
aVand I went to a warehouse in Queens
p243
aVto see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.
p244
aVAnd it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy \u2014
p245
aVhis name was Joey Grimaldi \u2014
p246
aVhe impersonated the Moorish general
p247
aV\u2014 you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,
p248
aVand then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so \u2014
p249
aVplumber, general, plumber, general \u2014
p250
aVso for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.
p251
aa(lp252
VSee, I think it's not really about impression,
p253
aVmaking people fall for a really perfect illusion,
p254
aVas much as it is to make \u2014 I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.
p255
aVBecause it's not about fooling somebody,
p256
aVit's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:
p257
aVhow much you want to be fooled.
p258
aVThat's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.
p259
aVWell, I think that's it.
p260
aVMy time is nearly up.
p261
aVThank you very much.
