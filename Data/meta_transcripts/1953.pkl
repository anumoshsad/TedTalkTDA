VCharlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email
p4
aVand he basically said,
p5
aVwe've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're
p6
aVa couple of middle-aged boring men.
p7
aVI said, I'm flattered by that \u2014
p8
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p9
aVbecause I'm a bit older,
p10
aVand he has a bit more net worth than I do.
p11
aa(lp12
VLarry Page: Well, thank you.
p13
aa(lp14
VCR: So we'll have a conversation about
p15
aVthe Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,
p16
aVand we'll have a conversation about search
p17
aVand privacy,
p18
aVand also about your philosophy
p19
aVand a sense of how you've connected the dots
p20
aVand how this journey that began
p21
aVsome time ago
p22
aVhas such interesting prospects.
p23
aVMainly we want to talk about the future.
p24
aVSo my first question: Where is Google
p25
aVand where is it going?
p26
aVLP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,
p27
aVand our mission we defined a long time ago
p28
aVis to organize the world's information
p29
aVand make it universally accessible and useful.
p30
aVAnd people always say,
p31
aVis that really what you guys are still doing?
p32
aVAnd I always kind of think about that myself,
p33
aVand I'm not quite sure.
p34
aVBut actually, when I think about search,
p35
aVit's such a deep thing for all of us,
p36
aVto really understand what you want,
p37
aVto understand the world's information,
p38
aVand we're still very much in the early stages of that,
p39
aVwhich is totally crazy.
p40
aVWe've been at it for 15 years already,
p41
aVbut it's not at all done.
p42
aa(lp43
VCR: When it's done, how will it be?
p44
aa(lp45
VLP: Well, I guess,
p46
aVin thinking about where we're going \u2014
p47
aVyou know, why is it not done? \u2014
p48
aVa lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.
p49
aVYou know, your computer doesn't know where you are,
p50
aVit doesn't know what you're doing,
p51
aVit doesn't know what you know,
p52
aVand a lot we've been trying to do recently
p53
aVis just make your devices work,
p54
aVmake them understand your context.
p55
aVGoogle Now, you know, knows where you are,
p56
aVknows what you may need.
p57
aVSo really having computing  work and understand you
p58
aVand understand that information,
p59
aVwe really haven't done that yet.
p60
aVIt's still very, very clunky.
p61
aa(lp62
VCR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing,
p63
aVwhere does Deep Mind fit?
p64
aa(lp65
VLP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company
p66
aVwe just acquired recently.
p67
aVIt's in the U.K.
p68
aVFirst, let me tell you the way we got there,
p69
aVwhich was looking at search
p70
aVand really understanding,
p71
aVtrying to understand everything,
p72
aVand also make the computers not clunky
p73
aVand really understand you \u2014
p74
aVlike, voice was really important.
p75
aVSo what's the state of the art  on speech recognition?
p76
aVIt's not very good.
p77
aVIt doesn't really understand you.
p78
aVSo we started doing machine learning research
p79
aVto improve that.
p80
aVThat helped a lot.
p81
aVAnd we started just looking at things like YouTube.
p82
aVCan we understand YouTube?
p83
aVBut we actually ran machine learning on YouTube
p84
aVand it discovered cats, just by itself.
p85
aVNow, that's an important concept.
p86
aVAnd we realized there's really something here.
p87
aVIf we can learn what cats are,
p88
aVthat must be really important.
p89
aVSo I think Deep Mind,
p90
aVwhat's really amazing about Deep Mind
p91
aVis that it can actually \u2014
p92
aVthey're learning things in this unsupervised way.
p93
aVThey started with video games,
p94
aVand really just, maybe I can show the video,
p95
aVjust playing video games,
p96
aVand learning how to do that automatically.
p97
aa(lp98
VCR: Take a look at the video games
p99
aVand how machines are coming to be able
p100
aVto do some remarkable things.
p101
aa(lp102
VLP: The amazing thing about this
p103
aVis this is, I mean, obviously,
p104
aVthese are old games,
p105
aVbut the system just sees what you see, the pixels,
p106
aVand it has the controls and it has the score,
p107
aVand it's learned to play all of these games,
p108
aVsame program.
p109
aVIt's learned to play all of these games
p110
aVwith superhuman performance.
p111
aVWe've not been able to do things like this
p112
aVwith computers before.
p113
aVAnd maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.
p114
aVThis is boxing, and it figures out it can
p115
aVsort of pin the opponent down.
p116
aVThe computer's on the left,
p117
aVand it's just racking up points.
p118
aVSo imagine if this kind
p119
aVof intelligence were thrown at your schedule,
p120
aVor your information needs, or things like that.
p121
aVWe're really just at the beginning of that,
p122
aVand that's what I'm really excited about.
p123
aa(lp124
VCR: When you look at all that's taken place
p125
aVwith Deep Mind and the boxing,
p126
aValso a part of where we're going
p127
aVis artificial intelligence.
p128
aVWhere are we, when you look at that?
p129
aa(lp130
VLP: Well, I think for me,
p131
aVthis is kind of one of the most exciting things
p132
aVI've seen in a long time.
p133
aVThe guy who started this company, Demis,
p134
aVhas a neuroscience and a computer science background.
p135
aVHe went back to school
p136
aVto get his Ph.D. to study the brain.
p137
aVAnd so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work
p138
aVgoing on that sort of crosses computer science
p139
aVand neuroscience
p140
aVin terms of really understanding
p141
aVwhat it takes to make something smart
p142
aVand do really interesting things.
p143
aa(lp144
VCR: But where's the level of it now?
p145
aVAnd how fast do you think we are moving?
p146
aa(lp147
VLP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,
p148
aVunderstanding cats on YouTube
p149
aVand things like that,
p150
aVimproving voice recognition.
p151
aVWe used a lot of machine learning
p152
aVto improve things incrementally,
p153
aVbut I think for me, this example's really exciting,
p154
aVbecause it's one program
p155
aVthat can do a lot of different things.
p156
aa(lp157
VCR: I don't know if we can do this,
p158
aVbut we've got the image of the cat.
p159
aVIt would be wonderful to see this.
p160
aVThis is how machines looked at cats
p161
aVand what they came up with.
p162
aVCan we see that image?
p163
aa(lp164
VLP: Yeah. CR: There it is. Can you see the cat?
p165
aVDesigned by machines, seen by machines.
p166
aa(lp167
VLP: That's right.
p168
aVSo this is learned from just watching YouTube.
p169
aVAnd there's no training,
p170
aVno notion of a cat,
p171
aVbut this concept of a cat
p172
aVis something important that you would understand,
p173
aVand now that the machines can kind of understand.
p174
aVMaybe just finishing
p175
aValso on the search part,
p176
aVit started with search, really understanding
p177
aVpeople's context and their information.
p178
aVI did have a video
p179
aVI wanted to show quickly on that
p180
aVthat we actually found.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Video) ["Soy, Kenya"]
p183
aa(lp184
VZack Matere: Not long ago,
p185
aVI planted a crop of potatoes.
p186
aVThen suddenly they started dying one after the other.
p187
aVI checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much.
p188
aVSo, I went and I did a search.
p189
aV["Zack Matere, Farmer"]
p190
aVPotato diseases.
p191
aVOne of the websites told me
p192
aVthat ants could be the problem.
p193
aVIt said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.
p194
aVThen after a few days the ants disappeared.
p195
aVI got excited about the Internet.
p196
aVI have this friend
p197
aVwho really would like to expand his business.
p198
aVSo I went with him to the cyber cafe
p199
aVand we checked out several sites.
p200
aVWhen I met him next, he was going to put a windmill
p201
aVat the local school.
p202
aVI felt proud because
p203
aVsomething that wasn't there before
p204
aVwas suddenly there.
p205
aVI realized that not everybody
p206
aVcan be able to access
p207
aVwhat I was able to access.
p208
aVI thought that I need to have an Internet
p209
aVthat my grandmother can use.
p210
aVSo I thought about a notice board.
p211
aVA simple wooden notice board.
p212
aVWhen I get information on my phone,
p213
aVI'm able to post the information
p214
aVon the notice board.
p215
aVSo it's basically like a computer.
p216
aVI use the Internet to help people.
p217
aVI think I am searching for
p218
aVa better life
p219
aVfor me and my neighbors.
p220
aVSo many people have access to information,
p221
aVbut there's no follow-up to that.
p222
aVI think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.
p223
aVWhen people have the knowledge,
p224
aVthey can find solutions
p225
aVwithout having to helped out.
p226
aVInformation is powerful,
p227
aVbut it is how we use it that will define us.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VLP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,
p232
aVactually, was we just read about it in the news,
p233
aVand we found this gentlemen,
p234
aVand made that little clip.
p235
aa(lp236
VCR: When I talk to people about you,
p237
aVthey say to me, people who know you well, say,
p238
aVLarry wants to change the world,
p239
aVand he believes technology can show the way.
p240
aVAnd that means access to the Internet.
p241
aVIt has to do with languages.
p242
aVIt also means how people can get access
p243
aVand do things that will affect their community,
p244
aVand this is an example.
p245
aVLP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,
p246
aVI have been focusing on access more,
p247
aVif we're talking about the future.
p248
aVWe recently released this Loon Project
p249
aVwhich is using balloons to do it.
p250
aVIt sounds totally crazy.
p251
aVWe can show the video here.
p252
aVActually, two out of three people in the world
p253
aVdon't have good Internet access now.
p254
aVWe actually think this can really help people
p255
aVsort of cost-efficiently.
p256
aa(lp257
VCR: It's a balloon. LP: Yeah, get access to the Internet.
p258
aa(lp259
VCR: And why does this balloon give you access
p260
aVto the Internet?
p261
aVBecause there was some interesting things
p262
aVyou had to do to figure out how
p263
aVto make balloons possible,
p264
aVthey didn't have to be tethered.
p265
aa(lp266
VLP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.
p267
aVLike, we've been thinking about this idea
p268
aVfor five years or more
p269
aVbefore we started working on it,
p270
aVbut it was just really,
p271
aVhow do we get access points up high, cheaply?
p272
aVYou normally have to use satellites
p273
aVand it takes a long time to launch them.
p274
aVBut you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon
p275
aVand get it up,
p276
aVand actually again, it's the power of the Internet,
p277
aVI did a search on it,
p278
aVand I found, 30, 40 years ago,
p279
aVsomeone had put up a balloon
p280
aVand it had gone around the Earth multiple times.
p281
aVAnd I thought, why can't we do that today?
p282
aVAnd that's how this project got going.
p283
aa(lp284
VCR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?
p285
aa(lp286
VLP: Yeah, but it turns out,
p287
aVwe did some weather simulations
p288
aVwhich probably hadn't really been done before,
p289
aVand if you control the altitude of the balloons,
p290
aVwhich you can do by pumping air into them
p291
aVand other ways,
p292
aVyou can actually control roughly where they go,
p293
aVand so I think we can build a worldwide mesh
p294
aVof these balloons that can cover the whole planet.
p295
aa(lp296
VCR: Before I talk about the future and transportation,
p297
aVwhere you've been a nerd for a while,
p298
aVand this fascination you have with transportation
p299
aVand automated cars and bicycles,
p300
aVlet me talk a bit about what's been the subject here
p301
aVearlier with Edward Snowden.
p302
aVIt is security and privacy.
p303
aVYou have to have been thinking about that.
p304
aa(lp305
VLP: Yeah, absolutely.
p306
aVI saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday.
p307
aVSome of you may have seen it.
p308
aVBut I think, for me, I guess,
p309
aVprivacy and security are a really important thing.
p310
aVWe think about it in terms of both things,
p311
aVand I think you can't have privacy without security,
p312
aVso let me just talk about security first,
p313
aVbecause you asked about Snowden and all of that,
p314
aVand then I'll say a little bit about privacy.
p315
aVI think for me, it's tremendously disappointing
p316
aVthat the government
p317
aVsecretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.
p318
aVI don't think we can have a democracy
p319
aVif we're having to protect you and our users
p320
aVfrom the government
p321
aVfor stuff that we've never had a conversation about.
p322
aVAnd I don't mean we have to know
p323
aVwhat the particular terrorist attack is they're worried
p324
aVabout protecting us from,
p325
aVbut we do need to know
p326
aVwhat the parameters of it is,
p327
aVwhat kind of surveillance the government's
p328
aVgoing to do and how and why,
p329
aVand I think we haven't had that conversation.
p330
aVSo I think the government's actually done
p331
aVitself a tremendous disservice
p332
aVby doing all that in secret.
p333
aa(lp334
VCR: Never coming to Google
p335
aVto ask for anything.
p336
aa(lp337
VLP: Not Google, but the public.
p338
aVI think we need to  have a debate about that,
p339
aVor we can't have a functioning democracy.
p340
aVIt's just not possible.
p341
aVSo I'm sad that Google's
p342
aVin the position of protecting you and our users
p343
aVfrom the government
p344
aVdoing secret thing that nobody knows about.
p345
aVIt doesn't make any sense.
p346
aa(lp347
VCR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.
p348
aa(lp349
VLP: Yes. The privacy side,
p350
aVI think it's \u2014 the world is changing.
p351
aVYou carry a phone. It knows where you are.
p352
aVThere's so much more information about you,
p353
aVand that's an important thing,
p354
aVand it makes sense why people are asking
p355
aVdifficult questions.
p356
aVWe spend a lot of time thinking about this
p357
aVand what the issues are.
p358
aVI'm a little bit \u2014
p359
aVI think the main thing that we need to do
p360
aVis just provide people choice,
p361
aVshow them what data's being collected \u2014
p362
aVsearch history, location data.
p363
aVWe're excited about incognito mode in Chrome,
p364
aVand doing that in more ways,
p365
aVjust giving people more choice
p366
aVand more awareness of what's going on.
p367
aVI also think it's very easy.
p368
aVWhat I'm worried is that we throw out
p369
aVthe baby with the bathwater.
p370
aVAnd I look at, on your show, actually,
p371
aVI kind of lost my voice,
p372
aVand I haven't gotten it back.
p373
aVI'm hoping that by talking to you
p374
aVI'm going to get it back.
p375
aa(lp376
VCR: If I could do anything, I would do that.
p377
aa(lp378
VLP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll
p379
aVand whatever you need to do.
p380
aVBut I think, you know what, I look at that,
p381
aVI made that public,
p382
aVand I got all this information.
p383
aVWe got a survey done on medical conditions
p384
aVwith people who have similar issues,
p385
aVand I look at medical records, and I say,
p386
aVwouldn't it be amazing
p387
aVif everyone's medical records were available
p388
aVanonymously
p389
aVto research doctors?
p390
aVAnd when someone accesses your medical record,
p391
aVa research doctor,
p392
aVthey could see, you could see which doctor
p393
aVaccessed it and why,
p394
aVand you could maybe learn about
p395
aVwhat conditions you have.
p396
aVI think if we just did that,
p397
aVwe'd save 100,000 lives this year.
p398
aa(lp399
VCR: Absolutely. Let me go \u2014 (Applause)
p400
aa(lp401
VLP: So I guess I'm just very worried that
p402
aVwith Internet privacy,
p403
aVwe're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records,
p404
aVis we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater,
p405
aVand we're not really thinking
p406
aVabout the tremendous good that can come
p407
aVfrom people sharing information
p408
aVwith the right people in the right ways.
p409
aa(lp410
VCR: And the necessary condition
p411
aVthat people have to have confidence
p412
aVthat their information will not be abused.
p413
aa(lp414
VLP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.
p415
aVI was scared to share it.
p416
aVSergey encouraged me to do that,
p417
aVand it was a great thing to do.
p418
aa(lp419
VCR: And the response has been overwhelming.
p420
aa(lp421
VLP: Yeah, and people are super positive.
p422
aVWe got thousands and thousands of people
p423
aVwith similar conditions,
p424
aVwhich there's no data on today.
p425
aVSo it was a really good thing.
p426
aa(lp427
VCR: So talking about the future, what is it about you
p428
aVand transportation systems?
p429
aa(lp430
VLP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated
p431
aVwith this when I was at college in Michigan.
p432
aVI had to get on the bus and take it
p433
aVand wait for it.
p434
aVAnd it was cold and snowing.
p435
aVI did some research on how much it cost,
p436
aVand I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems.
p437
aa(lp438
VCR: And that began the idea of an automated car.
p439
aa(lp440
VLP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about
p441
aVpeople working on automated cars,
p442
aVand I became fascinated by that,
p443
aVand it takes a while to  get these projects going,
p444
aVbut I'm super excited about the possibilities of that
p445
aVimproving the world.
p446
aVThere's 20 million people or more injured per year.
p447
aVIt's the leading cause of death
p448
aVfor people under 34 in the U.S.
p449
aa(lp450
VCR: So you're talking about saving lives.
p451
aa(lp452
VLP: Yeah, and also saving space
p453
aVand making life better.
p454
aVLos Angeles is half parking lots and roads,
p455
aVhalf of the area,
p456
aVand most cities are not far behind, actually.
p457
aVIt's just crazy
p458
aVthat that's what we use our space for.
p459
aa(lp460
VCR: And how soon will we be there?
p461
aa(lp462
VLP: I think we can be there very, very soon.
p463
aVWe've driven well over 100,000 miles
p464
aVnow totally automated.
p465
aVI'm super excited about getting that out quickly.
p466
aa(lp467
VCR: But it's not only you're talking about automated cars.
p468
aVYou also have this idea for bicycles.
p469
aa(lp470
VLP: Well at Google, we got this idea
p471
aVthat we should just provide free bikes to everyone,
p472
aVand that's been amazing, most of the trips.
p473
aVYou see bikes going everywhere,
p474
aVand the bikes wear out.
p475
aVThey're getting used 24 hours a day.
p476
aa(lp477
VCR: But you want to put them above the street, too.
p478
aa(lp479
VLP: Well I said, how do we get people
p480
aVusing bikes more?
p481
aa(lp482
VCR: We may have a video here.
p483
aa(lp484
VLP: Yeah, let's show the video.
p485
aVI just got excited about this.
p486
aa(lp487
V(Music)
p488
aVSo this is actually how you might separate
p489
aVbikes from cars with minimal cost.
p490
aVAnyway, it looks totally crazy,
p491
aVbut I was actually thinking about our campus,
p492
aVworking with the Zippies and stuff,
p493
aVand just trying to get a lot more bike usage,
p494
aVand I was thinking about,
p495
aVhow do you cost-effectively separate
p496
aVthe bikes from traffic?
p497
aVAnd I went and searched,
p498
aVand this is what I found.
p499
aVAnd we're not actually working on this,
p500
aVthat particular thing,
p501
aVbut it gets your imagination going.
p502
aa(lp503
VCR: Let me close with this.
p504
aVGive me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind.
p505
aVYou have this idea of [Google X].
p506
aVYou don't simply want
p507
aVto go in some small, measurable arena of progress.
p508
aa(lp509
VLP: Yeah, I think
p510
aVmany of the things we just  talked about are like that,
p511
aVwhere they're really \u2014
p512
aVI almost use the economic concept of additionality,
p513
aVwhich means that you're doing something
p514
aVthat wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it.
p515
aVAnd I think the more you can do things like that,
p516
aVthe bigger impact you have,
p517
aVand that's about doing things
p518
aVthat people might not think are possible.
p519
aVAnd I've been amazed,
p520
aVthe more I learn about technology,
p521
aVthe more I realize I don't know,
p522
aVand that's because this technological horizon,
p523
aVthe thing that you can see to do next,
p524
aVthe more you learn about technology,
p525
aVthe more you learn what's possible.
p526
aVYou learn that the balloons are possible
p527
aVbecause there's some material that will work for them.
p528
aa(lp529
VCR: What's interesting about  you too, though, for me,
p530
aVis that, we have lots of people
p531
aVwho are thinking about the future,
p532
aVand they are going and looking and they're coming back,
p533
aVbut we never see the implementation.
p534
aVI think of somebody you knew
p535
aVand read about, Tesla.
p536
aVThe principle of that for you is what?
p537
aa(lp538
VLP: Well, I think invention is not enough.
p539
aVIf you invent something,
p540
aVTesla invented electric power that we use,
p541
aVbut he struggled to get it out to people.
p542
aVThat had to be done by other people.
p543
aVIt took a long time.
p544
aVAnd I think if we can actually combine both things,
p545
aVwhere we have an innovation and invention focus,
p546
aVplus the ability to really \u2014 a company
p547
aVthat can really commercialize things
p548
aVand get them to people
p549
aVin a way that's positive for the world
p550
aVand to give people hope.
p551
aVYou know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project
p552
aVjust how excited people were about that,
p553
aVbecause it gave them hope
p554
aVfor the two thirds of the world
p555
aVthat doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.
p556
aa(lp557
VCR: Which is a second thing about corporations.
p558
aVYou are one of those people who believe
p559
aVthat corporations are an agent of change
p560
aVif they are run well.
p561
aa(lp562
VLP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed
p563
aVmost people think companies are basically evil.
p564
aVThey get a bad rap.
p565
aVAnd I think that's somewhat correct.
p566
aVCompanies are doing the same incremental thing
p567
aVthat they did 50 years ago
p568
aVor 20 years ago.
p569
aVThat's not really what we need.
p570
aVWe need, especially in technology,
p571
aVwe need revolutionary change,
p572
aVnot incremental change.
p573
aa(lp574
VCR: You once said, actually,
p575
aVas I think I've got this about right,
p576
aVthat you might consider,
p577
aVrather than giving your money,
p578
aVif you were leaving it to some cause,
p579
aVjust simply giving it to Elon Musk,
p580
aVbecause you had confidence
p581
aVthat he would change the future,
p582
aVand that you would therefore \u2014
p583
aa(lp584
VLP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars,
p585
aVhe wants to go to Mars,
p586
aVto back up humanity,
p587
aVthat's a worthy goal, but it's a company,
p588
aVand it's philanthropical.
p589
aVSo I think we aim to do kind of similar things.
p590
aVAnd I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees
p591
aVat Google who have become pretty wealthy.
p592
aVPeople make a lot of money in technology.
p593
aVA lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.
p594
aVYou're working because you want to change the world.
p595
aVYou want to make it better.
p596
aVWhy isn't the company that you work for
p597
aVworthy not just of your time
p598
aVbut your money as well?
p599
aVI mean, but we don't have a concept of that.
p600
aVThat's not how we think about companies,
p601
aVand I think it's sad,
p602
aVbecause companies are most of our effort.
p603
aVThey're where most of people's time is,
p604
aVwhere a lot of the money is,
p605
aVand so I think I'd like for us to help out
p606
aVmore than we are.
p607
aa(lp608
VCR: When I close conversations with lots of people,
p609
aVI always ask this question:
p610
aVWhat state of mind,
p611
aVwhat quality of mind is it
p612
aVthat has served you best?
p613
aVPeople like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity,
p614
aVand other people in the media have said that.
p615
aVBill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.
p616
aVWhat quality of mind,
p617
aVas I leave this audience,
p618
aVhas enabled you to think about the future
p619
aVand at the same time
p620
aVchange the present?
p621
aa(lp622
VLP: You know, I think the most important thing \u2014
p623
aVI looked at lots of companies
p624
aVand why I thought they don't succeed over time.
p625
aVWe've had a more rapid turnover of companies.
p626
aVAnd I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?
p627
aVWhat did those companies all do wrong?
p628
aVAnd usually it's just that they missed the future.
p629
aVAnd so I think, for me,
p630
aVI just try to focus on that and say,
p631
aVwhat is that future really going to be
p632
aVand how do we create it,
p633
aVand how do we cause our organization,
p634
aVto really focus on that
p635
aVand drive that at a really high rate?
p636
aVAnd so that's been curiosity,
p637
aVit's been looking at things
p638
aVpeople might not think about,
p639
aVworking on things that no one else is working on,
p640
aVbecause that's where the additionality really is,
p641
aVand be willing to do that,
p642
aVto take that risk.
p643
aVLook at Android.
p644
aVI felt guilty about working on Android
p645
aVwhen it was starting.
p646
aVIt was a little startup we bought.
p647
aVIt wasn't really what we were really working on.
p648
aVAnd I felt guilty about spending time on that.
p649
aVThat was stupid.
p650
aVThat was the future, right?
p651
aVThat was a good thing to be working on.
p652
aa(lp653
VCR: It is great to see you here.
p654
aVIt's great to hear from you,
p655
aVand a pleasure to sit at this table with you.
