VMark Twain summed up what I take to be
p4
aVone of the fundamental problems of cognitive science
p5
aVwith a single witticism.
p6
aVHe said, "There's something fascinating about science.
p7
aVOne gets such wholesale returns of conjecture
p8
aVout of such a trifling investment in fact."
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VTwain meant it as a joke, of course, but he's right:
p12
aVThere's something fascinating about science.
p13
aVFrom a few bones, we infer the existence of dinosuars.
p14
aVFrom spectral lines, the composition of nebulae.
p15
aVFrom fruit flies,
p16
aVthe mechanisms of heredity,
p17
aVand from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain,
p18
aVor in my case, from the behavior of very young children,
p19
aVwe try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms
p20
aVof human cognition.
p21
aVIn particular, in my lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT,
p22
aVI have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery
p23
aVof how children learn so much from so little so quickly.
p24
aVBecause, it turns out that the fascinating thing about science
p25
aVis also a fascinating thing about children,
p26
aVwhich, to put a gentler spin on Mark Twain,
p27
aVis precisely their ability to draw rich, abstract inferences
p28
aVrapidly and accurately from sparse, noisy data.
p29
aVI'm going to give you just two examples today.
p30
aVOne is about a problem of generalization,
p31
aVand the other is about a problem of causal reasoning.
p32
aVAnd although I'm going to talk about work in my lab,
p33
aVthis work is inspired by and indebted to a field.
p34
aVI'm grateful to mentors, colleagues, and collaborators around the world.
p35
aa(lp36
VLet me start with the problem of generalization.
p37
aVGeneralizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science.
p38
aVWe poll a tiny fraction of the electorate
p39
aVand we predict the outcome of national elections.
p40
aVWe see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial,
p41
aVand we bring drugs to a national market.
p42
aVBut this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population.
p43
aVIf our sample is cherry-picked in some way \u2014
p44
aVsay, we poll only urban voters,
p45
aVor say, in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease,
p46
aVwe include only men \u2014
p47
aVthe results may not generalize to the broader population.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not,
p50
aVbut what does that have to do with babies?
p51
aVWell, babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time.
p52
aVThey see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float,
p53
aVor a few balls and learn that they bounce.
p54
aVAnd they develop expectations about ducks and balls
p55
aVthat they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls
p56
aVfor the rest of their lives.
p57
aVAnd the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls
p58
aVthey have to make about almost everything:
p59
aVshoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see
p62
aVis plausibly representative of a larger population?
p63
aVLet's find out.
p64
aVI'm going to show you two movies,
p65
aVone from each of two conditions of an experiment,
p66
aVand because you're going to see just two movies,
p67
aVyou're going to see just two babies,
p68
aVand any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways.
p69
aVBut these babies, of course, here stand in for groups of babies,
p70
aVand the differences you're going to see
p71
aVrepresent average group differences in babies' behavior across conditions.
p72
aVIn each movie, you're going to see a baby doing maybe
p73
aVjust exactly what you might expect a baby to do,
p74
aVand we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are.
p75
aVBut to my mind the magical thing,
p76
aVand what I want you to pay attention to,
p77
aVis the contrast between these two conditions,
p78
aVbecause the only thing that differs between these two movies
p79
aVis the statistical evidence the babies are going to observe.
p80
aVWe're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls,
p81
aVand my then-graduate student, now colleague at Stanford, Hyowon Gweon,
p82
aVis going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box,
p83
aVand when she pulls those balls out, she's going to squeeze them,
p84
aVand the balls are going to squeak.
p85
aVAnd if you're a baby, that's like a TED Talk.
p86
aVIt doesn't get better than that.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVBut the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row
p89
aVout of a box of mostly blue balls.
p90
aVYou could do that with your eyes closed.
p91
aVIt's plausibly a random sample from this population.
p92
aVAnd if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak,
p93
aVthen maybe everything in the box squeaks.
p94
aVSo maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well.
p95
aVNow, those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end,
p96
aVso babies could do other things with them if they wanted to.
p97
aVThey could pound them or whack them.
p98
aVBut let's see what the baby does.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Video) Hyowon Gweon: See this? (Ball squeaks)
p101
aVDid you see that? (Ball squeaks)
p102
aVCool.
p103
aVSee this one?
p104
aV(Ball squeaks)
p105
aVWow.
p106
aa(lp107
VLaura Schulz: Told you. (Laughs)
p108
aa(lp109
V(Video) HG: See this one? (Ball squeaks)
p110
aVHey Clara, this one's for you. You can go ahead and play.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VLS: I don't even have to talk, right?
p114
aVAll right, it's nice that babies will generalize properties
p115
aVof blue balls to yellow balls,
p116
aVand it's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us,
p117
aVbut we've known those things about babies for a very long time.
p118
aVThe really interesting question
p119
aVis what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing,
p120
aVand we can ensure it's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment
p121
aVand we actually pull the balls from there,
p122
aVbut this time, all we change is the apparent population
p123
aVfrom which that evidence was drawn.
p124
aVThis time, we're going to show babies three blue balls
p125
aVpulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls,
p126
aVand guess what?
p127
aVYou [probably won't] randomly draw three blue balls in a row
p128
aVout of a box of mostly yellow balls.
p129
aVThat is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence.
p130
aVThat evidence suggests that maybe Hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls.
p131
aVMaybe there's something special about the blue balls.
p132
aVMaybe only the blue balls squeak.
p133
aVLet's see what the baby does.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Video) HG: See this? (Ball squeaks)
p136
aVSee this toy? (Ball squeaks)
p137
aVOh, that was cool. See? (Ball squeaks)
p138
aVNow this one's for you to play. You can go ahead and play.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Fussing) (Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VLS: So you just saw two 15-month-old babies
p143
aVdo entirely different things
p144
aVbased only on the probability of the sample they observed.
p145
aVLet me show you the experimental results.
p146
aVOn the vertical axis, you'll see the percentage of babies
p147
aVwho squeezed the ball in each condition,
p148
aVand as you'll see, babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence
p149
aVwhen it's plausibly representative of the population
p150
aVthan when the evidence is clearly cherry-picked.
p151
aVAnd this leads to a fun prediction:
p152
aVSuppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box.
p153
aVYou [probably won't] pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box,
p154
aVbut you could randomly sample just one blue ball.
p155
aVThat's not an improbable sample.
p156
aVAnd if you could reach into a box at random
p157
aVand pull out something that squeaks, maybe everything in the box squeaks.
p158
aVSo even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking,
p159
aVand have many fewer actions to imitate
p160
aVin this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw,
p161
aVwe predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more,
p162
aVand that's exactly what we found.
p163
aVSo 15-month-old babies, in this respect, like scientists,
p164
aVcare whether evidence is randomly sampled or not,
p165
aVand they use this to develop expectations about the world:
p166
aVwhat squeaks and what doesn't,
p167
aVwhat to explore and what to ignore.
p168
aa(lp169
VLet me show you another example now,
p170
aVthis time about a problem of causal reasoning.
p171
aVAnd it starts with a problem of confounded evidence
p172
aVthat all of us have,
p173
aVwhich is that we are part of the world.
p174
aVAnd this might not seem like a problem to you, but like most problems,
p175
aVit's only a problem when things go wrong.
p176
aVTake this baby, for instance.
p177
aVThings are going wrong for him.
p178
aVHe would like to make this toy go, and he can't.
p179
aVI'll show you a few-second clip.
p180
aVAnd there's two possibilities, broadly:
p181
aVMaybe he's doing something wrong,
p182
aVor maybe there's something wrong with the toy.
p183
aVSo in this next experiment,
p184
aVwe're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data
p185
aVsupporting one hypothesis over the other,
p186
aVand we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions
p187
aVabout what to do.
p188
aa(lp189
VHere's the setup.
p190
aVHyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed.
p191
aVI am then going to try twice and fail both times,
p192
aVand then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed,
p193
aVand this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students
p194
aVin technology across the board.
p195
aVBut the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence
p196
aVthat the problem isn't with the toy, it's with the person.
p197
aVSome people can make this toy go,
p198
aVand some can't.
p199
aVNow, when the baby gets the toy, he's going to have a choice.
p200
aVHis mom is right there,
p201
aVso he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person,
p202
aVbut there's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth,
p203
aVand he can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy.
p204
aVSo let's see what the baby does.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Video) HG: Two, three. Go! (Music)
p207
aVLS: One, two, three, go!
p208
aVArthur, I'm going to try again. One, two, three, go!
p209
aVYG: Arthur, let me try again, okay?
p210
aVOne, two, three, go! (Music)
p211
aVLook at that. Remember these toys?
p212
aVSee these toys? Yeah, I'm going to put this one over here,
p213
aVand I'm going to give this one to you.
p214
aVYou can go ahead and play.
p215
aVLS: Okay, Laura, but of course, babies love their mommies.
p216
aVOf course babies give toys to their mommies
p217
aVwhen they can't make them work.
p218
aVSo again, the really important question is what happens when we change
p219
aVthe statistical data ever so slightly.
p220
aVThis time, babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order,
p221
aVbut we're changing the distribution of evidence.
p222
aVThis time, Hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once, and so am I.
p223
aVAnd this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy, the toy is broken.
p224
aVIt doesn't work all the time.
p225
aVAgain, the baby's going to have a choice.
p226
aVHer mom is right next to her, so she can change the person,
p227
aVand there's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth.
p228
aVLet's watch what she does.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Video) HG: Two, three, go! (Music)
p231
aVLet me try one more time. One, two, three, go!
p232
aVHmm.
p233
aa(lp234
VLS: Let me try, Clara.
p235
aVOne, two, three, go!
p236
aVHmm, let me try again.
p237
aVOne, two, three, go! (Music)
p238
aVHG: I'm going to put this one over here,
p239
aVand I'm going to give this one to you.
p240
aVYou can go ahead and play.
p241
aV(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VLS: Let me show you the experimental results.
p244
aVOn the vertical axis, you'll see the distribution
p245
aVof children's choices in each condition,
p246
aVand you'll see that the distribution of the choices children make
p247
aVdepends on the evidence they observe.
p248
aVSo in the second year of life,
p249
aVbabies can use a tiny bit of statistical data
p250
aVto decide between two fundamentally different strategies
p251
aVfor acting in the world:
p252
aVasking for help and exploring.
p253
aVI've just shown you two laboratory experiments
p254
aVout of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points,
p255
aVbecause the really critical point
p256
aVis that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data
p257
aVunderlies all the species-specific cultural learning that we do.
p258
aVChildren learn about new tools from just a few examples.
p259
aVThey learn new causal relationships from just a few examples.
p260
aVThey even learn new words, in this case in American Sign Language.
p261
aa(lp262
VI want to close with just two points.
p263
aVIf you've been following my world, the field of brain and cognitive sciences,
p264
aVfor the past few years,
p265
aVthree big ideas will have come to your attention.
p266
aVThe first is that this is the era of the brain.
p267
aVAnd indeed, there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience:
p268
aVlocalizing functionally specialized regions of cortex,
p269
aVturning mouse brains transparent,
p270
aVactivating neurons with light.
p271
aVA second big idea
p272
aVis that this is the era of big data and machine learning,
p273
aVand machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding
p274
aVof everything from social networks to epidemiology.
p275
aVAnd maybe, as it tackles problems of scene understanding
p276
aVand natural language processing,
p277
aVto tell us something about human cognition.
p278
aVAnd the final big idea you'll have heard
p279
aVis that maybe it's a good idea we're going to know so much about brains
p280
aVand have so much access to big data,
p281
aVbecause left to our own devices,
p282
aVhumans are fallible, we take shortcuts,
p283
aVwe err, we make mistakes,
p284
aVwe're biased, and in innumerable ways,
p285
aVwe get the world wrong.
p286
aVI think these are all important stories,
p287
aVand they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human,
p288
aVbut I want you to note that today I told you a very different story.
p289
aVIt's a story about minds and not brains,
p290
aVand in particular, it's a story about the kinds of computations
p291
aVthat uniquely human minds can perform,
p292
aVwhich involve rich, structured knowledge and the ability to learn
p293
aVfrom small amounts of data, the evidence of just a few examples.
p294
aVAnd fundamentally, it's a story about how starting as very small children
p295
aVand continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments
p296
aVof our culture,
p297
aVwe get the world right.
p298
aa(lp299
VFolks, human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data.
p300
aVHuman minds think of altogether new ideas.
p301
aVHuman minds generate research and discovery,
p302
aVand human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater,
p303
aVand human minds take care of other humans:
p304
aVour old, our young, our sick.
p305
aVWe even heal them.
p306
aVIn the years to come, we're going to see technological innovations
p307
aVbeyond anything I can even envision,
p308
aVbut we are very unlikely
p309
aVto see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child
p310
aVin my lifetime or in yours.
p311
aVIf we invest in these most powerful learners and their development,
p312
aVin babies and children
p313
aVand mothers and fathers
p314
aVand caregivers and teachers
p315
aVthe ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms
p316
aVof technology, engineering and design,
p317
aVwe will not just be dreaming of a better future,
p318
aVwe will be planning for one.
p319
aa(lp320
VThank you very much.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aa(lp324
VChris Anderson: Laura, thank you. I do actually have a question for you.
p325
aVFirst of all, the research is insane.
p326
aVI mean, who would design an experiment like that? (Laughter)
p327
aVI've seen that a couple of times,
p328
aVand I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening,
p329
aVbut other people have done similar experiments; it checks out.
p330
aVThe babies really are that genius.
p331
aa(lp332
VLS: You know, they look really impressive in our experiments,
p333
aVbut think about what they look like in real life, right?
p334
aVIt starts out as a baby.
p335
aVEighteen months later, it's talking to you,
p336
aVand babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks,
p337
aVthey're things like "all gone," which refer to disappearance,
p338
aVor "uh-oh," which refer to unintentional actions.
p339
aVIt has to be that powerful.
p340
aVIt has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you.
p341
aVThey're figuring out the entire world.
p342
aVA four-year-old can talk to you about almost anything.
p343
aV(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VCA: And if I understand you right, the other key point you're making is,
p346
aVwe've been through these years where there's all this talk
p347
aVof how quirky and buggy our minds are,
p348
aVthat behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that
p349
aVthat we're not rational agents.
p350
aVYou're really saying that the bigger story is how extraordinary,
p351
aVand there really is genius there that is underappreciated.
p352
aa(lp353
VLS: One of my favorite quotes in psychology
p354
aVcomes from the social psychologist Solomon Asch,
p355
aVand he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove
p356
aVthe veil of self-evidence from things.
p357
aVThere are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day
p358
aVthat get the world right.
p359
aVYou know about objects and their properties.
p360
aVYou know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark.
p361
aVYou can walk through rooms.
p362
aVYou can figure out what other people are thinking. You can talk to them.
p363
aVYou can navigate space. You know about numbers.
p364
aVYou know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning.
p365
aVYou do this effortlessly, so we don't see it,
p366
aVbut that is how we get the world right, and it's a remarkable
p367
aVand very difficult-to-understand accomplishment.
p368
aa(lp369
VCA: I suspect there are people in the audience who have
p370
aVthis view of accelerating technological power
p371
aVwho might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes
p372
aVwill a computer do what a three-year-old child can do,
p373
aVbut what's clear is that in any scenario,
p374
aVour machines have so much to learn from our toddlers.
p375
aVLS: I think so. You'll have some machine learning folks up here.
p376
aVI mean, you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees
p377
aVor technology as a matter of practice,
p378
aVbut it's not just a difference in quantity,
p379
aVit's a difference in kind.
p380
aVWe have incredibly powerful computers,
p381
aVand they do do amazingly sophisticated things,
p382
aVoften with very big amounts of data.
p383
aVHuman minds do, I think, something quite different,
p384
aVand I think it's the structured, hierarchical nature of human knowledge
p385
aVthat remains a real challenge.
p386
aa(lp387
