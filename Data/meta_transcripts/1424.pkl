VPeople are living longer and societies are getting grayer.
p4
aVYou hear about it all the time.
p5
aVYou read about it in your newspapers.
p6
aVYou hear about it on your television sets.
p7
aVSometimes, I'm concerned
p8
aVthat we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives
p9
aVwith a kind of a complacency, even ease.
p10
aVBut make no mistake, longer lives can \u2014
p11
aVand, I believe, will improve quality of life at all ages.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow to put this in perspective, let me just zoom out for a minute.
p14
aVMore years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century
p15
aVthan all years added across all prior millennia
p16
aVof human evolution combined.
p17
aVIn the blink of an eye,
p18
aVwe nearly doubled the length of time that we're living.
p19
aVSo if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged,
p20
aVdon't kick yourself.
p21
aVIt's brand new.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd because fertility rates fell across that very same period
p24
aVthat life expectancy was going up,
p25
aVthat pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population,
p26
aVwith many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people
p27
aVwho make it and survive to old age,
p28
aVis being reshaped into a rectangle.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd now, if you're the kind of person
p31
aVwho can get chills from population statistics,
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
Vthese are the ones that should do it.
p36
aVBecause what that means
p37
aVis that for the first time in the history of the species,
p38
aVthe majority of babies born in the developed world
p39
aVare having the opportunity to grow old.
p40
aa(lp41
VHow did this happen?
p42
aVWell, we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.
p43
aVThis increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture \u2014
p44
aVthe crucible that holds science and technology
p45
aVand wide-scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being.
p46
aVThrough cultural changes, our ancestors largely eliminated early death
p47
aVso that people can now live out their full lives.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow there are problems associated with aging \u2014
p50
aVdiseases, poverty, loss of social status.
p51
aVIt's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
p52
aVBut the more we learn about aging,
p53
aVthe clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course
p54
aVis grossly inaccurate.
p55
aVAging brings some rather remarkable improvements \u2014
p56
aVincreased knowledge, expertise \u2014
p57
aVand emotional aspects of life improve.
p58
aVThat's right, older people are happy.
p59
aVThey're happier than middle-aged people, and younger people, certainly.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VStudy after study is coming to the same conclusion.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe CDC recently conducted a survey
p66
aVwhere they asked respondents simply to tell them
p67
aVwhether they experienced significant psychological distress
p68
aVin the previous week.
p69
aVAnd fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question
p70
aVthan middle-aged people, and younger people as well.
p71
aVAnd a recent Gallup poll asked participants
p72
aVhow much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day.
p73
aVAnd stress, worry, anger
p74
aVall decrease with age.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow social scientists call this the paradox of aging.
p77
aVI mean, after all, aging is not a piece of cake.
p78
aVSo we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding.
p79
aVWe've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people
p80
aVare and always have been the greatest generations.
p81
aVThat is that younger people today may not typically experience
p82
aVthese improvements as they grow older.
p83
aVWe've asked,
p84
aVwell, maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin
p85
aVon an otherwise depressing existence.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VBut the more we've tried to disavow this finding,
p90
aVthe more evidence we find to support it.
p91
aa(lp92
VYears ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study
p93
aVwhere we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period.
p94
aVOriginally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.
p95
aVAnd we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed
p96
aVas they grew older.
p97
aVOur participants would carry electronic pagers
p98
aVfor a week at a time,
p99
aVand we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times.
p100
aVAnd every time we paged them,
p101
aVwe'd ask them to answer several questions \u2014
p102
aV"On a one to seven scale, how happy are you right now?"
p103
aV"How sad are you right now?"
p104
aV"How frustrated are you right now?" \u2014
p105
aVso that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having
p106
aVin their day-to-day lives.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd using this intense study of individuals,
p109
aVwe find that it's not one particular generation
p110
aVthat's doing better than the others,
p111
aVbut the same individuals over time
p112
aVcome to report relatively greater positive experience.
p113
aVNow you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages.
p114
aVAnd there is a slight downturn.
p115
aVBut at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow it's really too simplistic to say that older people are "happy."
p118
aVIn our study, they are more positive.
p119
aVBut they're also more likely than younger people
p120
aVto experience mixed emotions \u2014
p121
aVsadness at the same time you experience happiness;
p122
aVyou know, that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend.
p123
aVAnd other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness
p124
aVmore comfortably.
p125
aVThey're more accepting of sadness than younger people are.
p126
aVAnd we suspect that this may help to explain
p127
aVwhy older people are better than younger people
p128
aVat solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates.
p129
aVOlder people can view injustice with compassion,
p130
aVbut not despair.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd all things being equal,
p133
aVolder people direct their cognitive resources, like attention and memory,
p134
aVto positive information more than negative.
p135
aVIf we show older, middle-aged, younger people images,
p136
aVlike the ones you see on the screen,
p137
aVand we later ask them to recall all the images that they can,
p138
aVolder people, but not younger people,
p139
aVremember more positive images than negative images.
p140
aVWe've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies,
p141
aVsome frowning, some smiling.
p142
aVOlder people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning, angry faces.
p143
aVIn day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives.
p146
aVWe've said, well, maybe older people report more positive emotions
p147
aVbecause they're cognitively impaired.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VWe've said, could it be
p152
aVthat positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions,
p153
aVand so you switch to the positive emotions?
p154
aVMaybe our neural centers in our brain
p155
aVare degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore.
p156
aVBut that's not the case.
p157
aVThe most mentally sharp older adults
p158
aVare the ones who show this positivity effect the most.
p159
aVAnd under conditions where it really matters,
p160
aVolder people do process the negative information
p161
aVjust as well as the positive information.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo how can this be?
p164
aVWell, in our research,
p165
aVwe've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally
p166
aVin the uniquely human ability to monitor time \u2014
p167
aVnot just clock time and calendar time, but lifetime.
p168
aVAnd if there's a paradox of aging,
p169
aVit's that recognizing that we won't live forever
p170
aVchanges our perspective on life in positive ways.
p171
aVWhen time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth,
p172
aVpeople are constantly preparing,
p173
aVtrying to soak up all the information they possibly can,
p174
aVtaking risks, exploring.
p175
aVWe might spend time with people we don't even like
p176
aVbecause it's somehow interesting.
p177
aVWe might learn something unexpected.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VWe go on blind dates.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VYou know, after all,
p186
aVif it doesn't work out, there's always tomorrow.
p187
aVPeople over 50 don't go on blind dates.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAs we age, our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change.
p192
aVWhen we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world,
p193
aVwe see our priorities most clearly.
p194
aVWe take less notice of trivial matters.
p195
aVWe savor life.
p196
aVWe're more appreciative,
p197
aVmore open to reconciliation.
p198
aVWe invest in more emotionally important parts of life,
p199
aVand life gets better,
p200
aVso we're happier day-to-day.
p201
aVBut that same shift in perspective
p202
aVleads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice.
p203
aa(lp204
VBy 2015,
p205
aVthere will be more people in the United States
p206
aVover the age of 60 than under 15.
p207
aVWhat will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people?
p208
aVThe numbers won't determine the outcome.
p209
aVCulture will.
p210
aVIf we invest in science and technology
p211
aVand find solutions for the real problems that older people face
p212
aVand we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people,
p213
aVthen added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages.
p214
aVSocieties with millions of talented, emotionally stable citizens
p215
aVwho are healthier and better educated than any generations before them,
p216
aVarmed with knowledge about the practical matters of life
p217
aVand motivated to solve the big issues
p218
aVcan be better societies than we have ever known.
p219
aa(lp220
VMy father, who is 92, likes to say,
p221
aV"Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks
p222
aVand start talking about how to get them to save us all."
