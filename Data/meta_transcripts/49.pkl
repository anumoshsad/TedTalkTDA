VI'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.
p4
aVI don't have much time to do it.
p5
aVAnd I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.
p6
aa(lp7
VThe first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.
p8
aVIt's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level,
p9
aVand it transcends all the baggage
p10
aVthat normally comes with what people would call,
p11
aVsort of a rational conclusion to something.
p12
aVAnd it concludes in something that you see here,
p13
aVthat you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe second \u2014
p16
aVthe second is that this process does not have a signature.
p17
aVThere is no authorship.
p18
aVArchitects are obsessed with authorship.
p19
aVThis is something that has editing and it has teams,
p20
aVbut in fact, we no longer see within this process,
p21
aVthe traditional master architect
p22
aVcreating a sketch that his minions carry out.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd the third is that it challenges \u2014
p25
aVand this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why,
p26
aVconnect all these things \u2014
p27
aVbut it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.
p28
aVHigh modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic,
p29
aValmost anything can happen within them.
p30
aVI call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" \u2014
p31
aVturn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.
p32
aVSo, this is the promise of high modernism:
p33
aVwithin a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.
p34
aVBut as we're seeing,
p35
aVoperational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs
p36
aVin terms of design parameters.
p37
aVAnd so, with this sort of idea,
p38
aVwhat happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day,
p39
aVor whatever seems to be the most immediate need,
p40
aVstarts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it,
p41
aVof anything else could ever happen.
p42
aVAnd so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility,
p43
aVsomething that we call "compartmentalized flexibility."
p44
aVAnd the idea is that you, within that continuum,
p45
aVidentify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.
p46
aVThey can be pushed off-center a little bit,
p47
aVbut in the end you actually still get as much
p48
aVof that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.
p49
aVWith high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow I'm going to talk about \u2014
p52
aVI'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library
p53
aVin this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams,
p54
aVand I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.
p55
aVWith the library staff and the library board,
p56
aVwe settled on two core positions.
p57
aVThis is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years,
p58
aVthe evolution of the book, and other technologies.
p59
aVThis diagram was our sort of position piece about the book,
p60
aVand our position was, books are technology \u2014
p61
aVthat's something people forget \u2014
p62
aVbut it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance
p63
aVwith any other form of truly potent technology or media.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe second premise \u2014
p66
aVand this was something that was very difficult for us
p67
aVto convince the librarians of at first \u2014
p68
aVis that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America,
p69
aVhad a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.
p70
aVOk, now, this I'll come back to later, but something \u2014
p71
aVactually, the librarians at first said, "No, this isn't our mandate.
p72
aVOur mandate is media, and particularly the book."
p73
aa(lp74
VSo what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.
p75
aVThe upper diagram is what we had seen
p76
aVin a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.
p77
aVSort of, any activity could happen anywhere.
p78
aVWe don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book;
p79
aVand so, we'll use this approach.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse \u2014
p82
aVnot only were they very generic \u2014
p83
aVso, not only does the reading room look like the copy room
p84
aVlook like the magazine area \u2014
p85
aVbut it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment
p86
aVwas starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.
p87
aVAnd in this case, what was getting engulfed
p88
aVwere these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.
p89
aVAnd so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.
p90
aVVery dumb approach: simply compartmentalize.
p91
aVPut those things whose evolution we could predict \u2014
p92
aVand I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future,
p93
aVbut we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future \u2014
p94
aVput those in boxes designed specifically for it,
p95
aVand put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.
p96
aVSo that was the core idea.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, we had to convince the library
p99
aVthat social roles were equally important to media,
p100
aVin order to get them to accept this.
p101
aVWhat you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.
p102
aVThat's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.
p103
aVOur first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say,
p104
aV"You know what? We haven't touched it,
p105
aVbut only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.
p106
aVTwo-thirds of it is already dedicated \u2014
p107
aVthat's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important \u2014
p108
aVis already dedicated to social functions."
p109
aVSo once we had presented that back to them,
p110
aVthey agreed that this sort of core concept could work.
p111
aVWe got the right to go back to first principles \u2014
p112
aVthat's the third diagram.
p113
aVWe recombined everything.
p114
aVAnd then we started making new decisions.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhat you're seeing on the right is the design of the library,
p117
aVspecifically in terms of square footage.
p118
aVOn the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms \u2014
p119
aVsort of combs, collective programs.
p120
aVAnd on the right are the more indeterminate spaces;
p121
aVthings like reading rooms,
p122
aVwhose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.
p123
aVSo that literally was the design of the building.
p124
aVThey signed it, and to their chagrin,
p125
aVwe came back a week later, and we presented them this.
p126
aVAnd as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VWe just sized \u2014 no, really, I mean that, literally.
p131
aVThe things on the left-hand side of the diagram,
p132
aVthose are the boxes.
p133
aVWe sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient.
p134
aVWe had a very low budget to work with.
p135
aVWe pushed them around on the site
p136
aVto make very literal contextual relationships.
p137
aVThe reading room should be able to see the water.
p138
aVThe main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it
p139
aVto abide by the zoning code, and so forth.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.
p142
aVwithin each one, a very discrete thing is happening.
p143
aVThe area in between is sort of an urban continuum,
p144
aVthese things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.
p145
aVTo give you some sense of the power of this idea,
p146
aVthe biggest block is what we call the book spiral.
p147
aVIt's literally built in a very inexpensive way \u2014
p148
aVit is a parking garage for books.
p149
aVIt just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building,
p150
aVbut that is not necessarily an expensive approach.
p151
aVAnd it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System
p152
aVon one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building,
p153
aVit will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears
p154
aVthat we've all experienced in public libraries.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so this was the final operation,
p159
aVwhich was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter,
p160
aVand to hold onto them with a skin.
p161
aVThat skin serves double duty, again, for economics.
p162
aVOne, it is the lateral stability for the entire building;
p163
aVit's a structural element.
p164
aVBut its dimensions were designed not only for structure,
p165
aVbut also for holding on every piece of glass.
p166
aVThe glass was then \u2014 I'll use the word impregnated \u2014
p167
aVbut it had a layer of metal that was called "stretched metal."
p168
aVThat metal acts as a microlouver,
p169
aVso from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque,
p170
aVbut from the interior, it's entirely transparent.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.
p173
aVLet me see if I can find it.
p174
aVFor anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize.
p175
aVSo, this is the building.
p176
aVAnd I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building,
p177
aVthe public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.
p178
aVAnd it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.
p179
aVThey said, "Look, we don't know what it is,
p180
aVbut we know it's everything that we need it to be,
p181
aVbased on the observations that we've done about the program."
p182
aVThis is going into one of the entries.
p183
aVSo, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo now we're going into what we call the living room.
p186
aVThis is actually a program that we invented with the library.
p187
aVIt was recognizing that public libraries
p188
aVare the last vestige of public free space.
p189
aVThere are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain
p190
aVin downtown Seattle,
p191
aVbut there are not so many free places
p192
aVthat allow you to get out of the rain.
p193
aVSo this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything,
p194
aVincluding eat, yell, play chess and so forth.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.
p197
aVThat was the main technology area in the building.
p198
aVYou'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.
p199
aVAnd now up.
p200
aVThis is actually the place that we put into the building
p201
aVso I could propose to my wife, right there.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VShe said yes.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VI'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.
p210
aVI can show this to you later.
p211
aVBut let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral,
p212
aVbecause I think it's, as I said, the most \u2014
p213
aVthis is the main reading room \u2014 the most unique part of the building.
p214
aVYou dizzy yet?
p215
aVOk, so here, this is the book spiral.
p216
aVSo, it's very indiscernible,
p217
aVbut it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.
p218
aVIt allows you to, on one city block,
p219
aVgo up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.
p220
aa(lp221
VOk, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.
p222
aVI'm going to go very, very quickly through this.
p223
aVNow this is the Dallas Theater.
p224
aVIt was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said,
p225
aV"We need you to do a new building.
p226
aVWe've been working in a temporary space for 30 years,
p227
aVbut because of that temporary space,
p228
aVwe've become an infamous theater company.
p229
aVTheater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle,
p230
aVwith the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."
p231
aVAnd the very fact that they worked in a provisional space
p232
aVmeant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall;
p233
aVthey could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building
p236
aVthat could be a pristine building,
p237
aVbut keep this kind of experimental nature.
p238
aVAnd the second is,
p239
aVthey were what we call a multi-form theater,
p240
aVthey do different kinds of performances in repertory.
p241
aVSo they in the morning will do something in arena,
p242
aVthen they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.
p243
aVAnd so they needed to be able to quickly transform
p244
aVbetween different theater organizations,
p245
aVand for operational budget reasons,
p246
aVthis actually no longer happens in pretty much
p247
aVany multi-form theater in the United States,
p248
aVso we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo our thought was to literally put the theater on its head:
p251
aVto take those things that were previously defined
p252
aVas front-of-house and back-of-house
p253
aVand stack them above house and below house,
p254
aVand to create what we called a theater machine.
p255
aVWe invest the money in the operation of the building.
p256
aVIt's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere,
p257
aVwherever you place it,
p258
aVthe area under it is charged for theatrical performances.
p259
aVAnd it allowed us to go back to first principles,
p260
aVand redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.
p261
aVAnd at the push of a button,
p262
aVit allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust,
p263
aVand in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor,
p264
aVin a very quick transfiguration.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo in fact, using operational budget, we can \u2014
p267
aVsorry, capital cost \u2014 we can actually achieve
p268
aVwhat was no longer achievable in operational cost.
p269
aVAnd that means that the artistic director
p270
aVnow has a palette that he or she can choose from,
p271
aVbetween a series of forms and a series of processions,
p272
aVbecause that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped
p273
aVwith front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated.
p274
aVSo an artistic director has the ability to have a performance
p275
aVthat enters in a Wagnerian procession,
p276
aVshows the first act in thrust,
p277
aVthe intermission in a Greek procession,
p278
aVsecond act in arena, and so forth.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo I'm going to show you what this actually means.
p281
aVThis is the theater up close.
p282
aVAny portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.
p283
aVThe light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure,
p284
aVso you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.
p285
aVPortions can be opened,
p286
aVso you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance,
p287
aVor you can even just have an open-air performance,
p288
aVor for intermissions.
p289
aVThe balconies all move to go between those configurations,
p290
aVbut they also disappear.
p291
aVThe proscenium line can also disappear.
p292
aVYou can bring enormous objects in,
p293
aVso in fact, the Dallas Theater Company \u2014
p294
aVtheir first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh,
p295
aVand they'll want to bring in a real aircraft.
p296
aVAnd then it also provides them, in the off-season,
p297
aVthe ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.
p298
aVThis is it from a distance.
p299
aVOpen up entire portions for different kinds of events.
p300
aVAnd at night.
p301
aVAgain, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.
p302
aVThis is a monster truck show.
p303
aa(lp304
VI'm going to show now the last project.
p305
aVThis also is an unusual client.
p306
aVThey inverted the whole idea of development.
p307
aVThey came to us and they said \u2014 unlike normal developers \u2014
p308
aVthey said, "We want to start out
p309
aVby providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville.
p310
aVThat's our main goal."
p311
aVAnd so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money,
p312
aVthey saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.
p313
aVAnd the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum
p314
aVactually built their pro forma,
p315
aVso they worked in reverse.
p316
aVAnd that pro forma led us
p317
aVto a mixed-use building that was very large,
p318
aVin order to support their aspirations of the art,
p319
aVbut it also opened up opportunities for the art itself
p320
aVto collaborate, interact with commercial spaces
p321
aVthat actually artists more and more want to work within.
p322
aVAnd it also charged us with thinking about how to have
p323
aVsomething that was both a single building
p324
aVand a credible sort of sub-building.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo this is Louisville's skyline,
p327
aVand I'm going to take you through the various constraints
p328
aVthat led to the project.
p329
aVFirst: the physical constraints.
p330
aVWe actually had to operate on three discrete sites,
p331
aVall of them well smaller than the size of the building.
p332
aVWe had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.
p333
aVWe had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.
p334
aVNow, this area floods three to four times a year,
p335
aVand there's a levee behind our site,
p336
aVsimilar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.
p337
aVHad to operate behind the I-64 corridor,
p338
aVa street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.
p339
aVSo we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.
p340
aVUnderneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.
p341
aVAnd there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add,
p342
aVthat would link a series of cultural buildings,
p343
aVand a view corridor \u2014 because this is the historic district \u2014
p344
aVthat they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.
p349
aVAnd if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet \u2014
p350
aVthese are the different programs \u2014
p351
aVthe traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites,
p352
aVand now we'd have a really terrible situation:
p353
aVa public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.
p354
aVAnd then we would size all the other elements \u2014
p355
aVthe different commercial elements:
p356
aVhotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth \u2014
p357
aVand dump it on top.
p358
aVAnd we would create something that was unviable.
p359
aVIn fact \u2014 and you know this \u2014 this is called the Time Warner Building.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VSo our strategy was very simple.
p364
aVJust lift the entire block,
p365
aVflip some of the elements over,
p366
aVreposition them so they have appropriate views
p367
aVand relationships to downtown,
p368
aVand make circulation connections and reroute the road.
p369
aVSo that's the basic concept,
p370
aVand now I'm going to show you what it leads to.
p371
aa(lp372
VOk, it seems a very formal, willful gesture,
p373
aVbut something derived entirely out of the constraints.
p374
aVAnd again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness
p375
aVthat this was about an architect making a statement,
p376
aVnot an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.
p377
aVNow, within that center zone, as I said,
p378
aVwe have the ability to mix a series of things.
p379
aVSo here, this is sort of an x-ray \u2014
p380
aVthe towers are totally developer-driven.
p381
aVThey told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth,
p382
aVand we focused on taking all the public components \u2014
p383
aVthe lobbies, the bars \u2014
p384
aVeverything that different commercial elements would have,
p385
aVand combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map,
p386
aVin the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate
p389
aVwithin an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor,
p390
aVbut it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.
p391
aVIt allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen,
p392
aVor to see the art, and so forth.
p393
aVIt also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool,
p394
aVthey can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool,
p395
aVso they're not forced to always work within the confines
p396
aVof a contemporary gallery space.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo, how to build this.
p399
aVIt's very simple: it's a chair.
p400
aVSo, we begin by building the cores.
p401
aVAs we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.
p402
aVThat allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.
p403
aVThis is not a high-budget building.
p404
aVThe moment the cores get to mid level,
p405
aVwe finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it;
p406
aVand then we jack it up into the air.
p407
aVThis is how they build really large aircraft hangars,
p408
aVfor instance, the ones that they did for the A380.
p409
aVFinish the cores, finish the meat
p410
aVand you get something that looks like this.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow I only have about 30 seconds,
p413
aVso I want to start an animation,
p414
aVand we'll conclude with that.
p415
aa(lp416
VThank you.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Applause)
p419
aa(lp420
VChris asked me to add \u2014
p421
