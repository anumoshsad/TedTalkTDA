VSo I wanted to tell a story
p4
aVthat really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,
p5
aVand it's a story of something that happened
p6
aV3,000 years ago,
p7
aVwhen the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
p8
aVAnd it takes place in an area called the Shephelah
p9
aVin what is now Israel.
p10
aVAnd the reason the story obsessed me is that
p11
aVI thought I understood it, and then I went back over it
p12
aVand I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
p13
aa(lp14
VAncient Palestine had a \u2014 along its eastern border,
p15
aVthere's a mountain range.
p16
aVStill same is true of Israel today.
p17
aVAnd in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities
p18
aVof that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.
p19
aVAnd then there's a coastal plain
p20
aValong the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
p21
aVAnd connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain
p22
aVis an area called the Shephelah,
p23
aVwhich is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,
p24
aVand you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah
p25
aVto get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
p26
aVAnd the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know
p27
aVit's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
p28
aVIt's gorgeous, with forests of oak
p29
aVand wheat fields and vineyards.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut more importantly, though, in the history of that region,
p32
aVit's served, it's had a real strategic function,
p33
aVand that is, it is the means by which hostile armies
p34
aVon the coastal plain find their way,
p35
aVget up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
p36
aVAnd 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
p37
aVThe Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies
p38
aVof the Kingdom of Israel,
p39
aVare living in the coastal plain.
p40
aVThey're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.
p41
aVAnd they may start to make their way
p42
aVthrough one of the valleys of the Shephelah
p43
aVup into the mountains,
p44
aVbecause what they want to do is occupy the highland area
p45
aVright by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
p46
aVAnd the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,
p47
aVobviously catches wind of this,
p48
aVand Saul brings his army down from the mountains
p49
aVand he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,
p50
aVone of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
p51
aVAnd the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,
p52
aVand the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,
p53
aVand the two armies just sit there for weeks
p54
aVand stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
p55
aVNeither can attack the other, because to attack the other side
p56
aVyou've got to come down the mountain into the valley
p57
aVand then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo finally, to break the deadlock,
p60
aVthe Philistines send their mightiest warrior
p61
aVdown into the valley floor, and he calls out
p62
aVand he says to the Israelites,
p63
aV"Send your mightiest warrior down,
p64
aVand we'll have this out, just the two of us."
p65
aa(lp66
VThis was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
p67
aVIt was a way of settling disputes
p68
aVwithout incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
p69
aVAnd the Philistine who is sent down,
p70
aVtheir mighty warrior, is a giant.
p71
aVHe's 6 foot 9.
p72
aVHe's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,
p73
aVand he's got a sword and he's got a javelin
p74
aVand he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.
p75
aVAnd he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
p76
aVIt's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd finally the only person who will come forward
p79
aVis this young shepherd boy,
p80
aVand he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.
p83
aVYou're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."
p84
aa(lp85
VBut the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,
p86
aVyou don't understand, I have been defending my flock
p87
aVagainst lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.
p90
aVSo he says, "All right."
p91
aVAnd then he turns to the kid, and he says,
p92
aV"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."
p93
aa(lp94
VSo he tries to give the shepherd his armor,
p95
aVand the shepherd says, "No."
p96
aVHe says, "I can't wear this stuff."
p97
aVThe Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"
p98
aVmeaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."
p99
aa(lp100
VSo he reaches down instead on the ground
p101
aVand picks up five stones
p102
aVand puts them in his shepherd's bag
p103
aVand starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.
p104
aVAnd the giant sees this figure approaching,
p105
aVand calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh
p106
aVto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."
p107
aVHe issues this kind of taunt towards this person
p108
aVcoming to fight him.
p109
aVAnd the shepherd draws closer and closer,
p110
aVand the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
p111
aVThat's all he's carrying.
p112
aVInstead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,
p113
aVand he says \u2014 he's insulted \u2014
p114
aV"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd the shepherd boy takes one of his stones
p117
aVout of his pocket, puts it in his sling
p118
aVand rolls it around and lets it fly
p119
aVand it hits the giant right between the eyes \u2014
p120
aVright here, in his most vulnerable spot \u2014
p121
aVand he falls down either dead or unconscious,
p122
aVand the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword
p123
aVand cuts off his head,
p124
aVand the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd of course, the name of the giant is Goliath
p127
aVand the name of the shepherd boy is David,
p128
aVand the reason that story has obsessed me
p129
aVover the course of writing my book
p130
aVis that everything I thought I knew about that story
p131
aVturned out to be wrong.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
p134
aVIn fact, that term, David and Goliath,
p135
aVhas entered our language as a metaphor for
p136
aVimprobable victories
p137
aVby some weak party over someone far stronger.
p138
aVNow why do we call David an underdog?
p139
aVWell, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,
p140
aVa little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
p141
aVWe also call him an underdog
p142
aVbecause Goliath is an experienced warrior,
p143
aVand David is just a shepherd.
p144
aVBut most importantly, we call him an underdog
p145
aVbecause all he has is \u2014 it's that Goliath is outfitted with
p146
aVall of this modern weaponry,
p147
aVthis glittering coat of armor
p148
aVand a sword and a javelin and a spear,
p149
aVand all David has is this sling.
p150
aa(lp151
VWell, let's start there with the phrase
p152
aV"All David has is this sling,"
p153
aVbecause that's the first mistake that we make.
p154
aVIn ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
p155
aVThere's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
p156
aVThere's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,
p157
aVarmed foot soldiers with swords and shields
p158
aVand some kind of armor.
p159
aVAnd there's artillery, and artillery are archers,
p160
aVbut, more importantly, slingers.
p161
aVAnd a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch
p162
aVwith two long cords attached to it,
p163
aVand they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,
p164
aVinside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this
p165
aVand they let one of the cords go,
p166
aVand the effect is to send the projectile forward
p167
aVtowards its target.
p168
aVThat's what David has, and it's important to understand
p169
aVthat that sling is not a slingshot.
p170
aVIt's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.
p171
aVIt's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
p172
aVWhen David rolls it around like this,
p173
aVhe's turning the sling around probably
p174
aVat six or seven revolutions per second,
p175
aVand that means that when the rock is released,
p176
aVit's going forward really fast,
p177
aVprobably 35 meters per second.
p178
aVThat's substantially faster than a baseball
p179
aVthrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
p180
aVMore than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah
p181
aVwere not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,
p182
aVwhich are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
p183
aVIf you do the calculations on the ballistics,
p184
aVon the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,
p185
aVit's roughly equal to the stopping power
p186
aVof a [.45 caliber] handgun.
p187
aVThis is an incredibly devastating weapon.
p188
aVAccuracy, we know from historical records
p189
aVthat slingers \u2014 experienced slingers could hit
p190
aVand maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.
p191
aVFrom medieval tapestries, we know that slingers
p192
aVwere capable of hitting birds in flight.
p193
aVThey were incredibly accurate.
p194
aVWhen David lines up \u2014 and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,
p195
aVhe's quite close to Goliath \u2014
p196
aVwhen he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,
p197
aVhe has every intention and every expectation
p198
aVof being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot
p199
aVbetween his eyes.
p200
aVIf you go back over the history of ancient warfare,
p201
aVyou will find time and time again
p202
aVthat slingers were the decisive factor against infantry
p203
aVin one kind of battle or another.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,
p206
aVand his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel
p207
aVis that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
p208
aVWhen he says, "Come to me that I might
p209
aVfeed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
p210
aVthe key phrase is "Come to me."
p211
aVCome up to me because we're going to fight,
p212
aVhand to hand, like this.
p213
aVSaul has the same expectation.
p214
aVDavid says, "I want to fight Goliath,"
p215
aVand Saul tries to give him his armor,
p216
aVbecause Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'
p217
aVyou mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'
p218
aVinfantry on infantry."
p219
aa(lp220
VBut David has absolutely no expectation.
p221
aVHe's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?
p222
aVHe's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career
p223
aVusing a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.
p224
aVThat's where his strength lies.
p225
aVSo here he is, this shepherd, experienced
p226
aVin the use of a devastating weapon,
p227
aVup against this lumbering giant
p228
aVweighed down by a hundred pounds of armor
p229
aVand these incredibly heavy weapons
p230
aVthat are useful only in short-range combat.
p231
aVGoliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.
p232
aVSo why do we keep calling David an underdog,
p233
aVand why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
p234
aa(lp235
VThere's a second piece of this that's important.
p236
aVIt's not just that we misunderstand David
p237
aVand his choice of weaponry.
p238
aVIt's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.
p239
aVGoliath is not what he seems to be.
p240
aVThere's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,
p241
aVthings that are in retrospect quite puzzling
p242
aVand don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.
p243
aVSo to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath
p244
aVis led onto the valley floor by an attendant.
p245
aVNow that is weird, right?
p246
aVHere is this mighty warrior
p247
aVchallenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.
p248
aVWhy is he being led by the hand
p249
aVby some young boy, presumably,
p250
aVto the point of combat?
p251
aVSecondly, the Bible story makes special note
p252
aVof how slowly Goliath moves,
p253
aVanother odd thing to say when you're describing
p254
aVthe mightiest warrior known to man at that point.
p255
aVAnd then there's this whole weird thing
p256
aVabout how long it takes Goliath to react
p257
aVto the sight of David.
p258
aVSo David's coming down the mountain,
p259
aVand he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.
p260
aVThere is nothing about him that says,
p261
aV"I am about to fight you like this."
p262
aVHe's not even carrying a sword.
p263
aVWhy does Goliath not react to that?
p264
aVIt's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.
p265
aVAnd then there's that strange comment he makes to David:
p266
aV"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
p267
aVSticks? David only has one stick.
p268
aa(lp269
VWell, it turns out that there's been a great deal
p270
aVof speculation within the medical community over the years
p271
aVabout whether there is something
p272
aVfundamentally wrong with Goliath,
p273
aVan attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.
p274
aVThere have been many articles written.
p275
aVThe first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,
p276
aVand it started a chain of speculation
p277
aVthat starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.
p278
aVSo Goliath is head and shoulders above
p279
aVall of his peers in that era,
p280
aVand usually when someone is that far out of the norm,
p281
aVthere's an explanation for it.
p282
aVSo the most common form of giantism
p283
aVis a condition called acromegaly,
p284
aVand acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor
p285
aVon your pituitary gland
p286
aVthat causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.
p287
aVAnd throughout history, many of the most famous giants
p288
aVhave all had acromegaly.
p289
aVSo the tallest person of all time
p290
aVwas a guy named Robert Wadlow
p291
aVwho was still growing when he died at the age of 24
p292
aVand he was 8 foot 11.
p293
aVHe had acromegaly.
p294
aVDo you remember the wrestler André the Giant?
p295
aVFamous. He had acromegaly.
p296
aVThere's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
p297
aVAnyone who's unusually tall,
p298
aVthat's the first explanation we come up with.
p299
aVAnd acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects
p300
aVassociated with it,
p301
aVprincipally having to do with vision.
p302
aVThe pituitary tumor, as it grows,
p303
aVoften starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,
p304
aVwith the result that people with acromegaly
p305
aVhave either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo when people have started to speculate
p308
aVabout what might have been wrong with Goliath,
p309
aVthey've said, "Wait a minute,
p310
aVhe looks and sounds an awful lot like someone
p311
aVwho has acromegaly."
p312
aVAnd that would also explain so much of what was strange
p313
aVabout his behavior that day.
p314
aVWhy does he move so slowly
p315
aVand have to be escorted down into the valley floor
p316
aVby an attendant?
p317
aVBecause he can't make his way on his own.
p318
aVWhy is he so strangely oblivious to David
p319
aVthat he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him
p320
aVuntil the very last moment?
p321
aVBecause he can't see him.
p322
aVWhen he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh
p323
aVto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
p324
aVthe phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.
p325
aVCome to me because I can't see you.
p326
aVAnd then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
p327
aVHe sees two sticks when David has only one.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo the Israelites up on the mountain ridge
p330
aVlooking down on him thought he was
p331
aVthis extraordinarily powerful foe.
p332
aVWhat they didn't understand was that
p333
aVthe very thing that was the source of his apparent strength
p334
aVwas also the source of his greatest weakness.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd there is, I think, in that,
p337
aVa very important lesson for all of us.
p338
aVGiants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
p339
aVAnd sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
