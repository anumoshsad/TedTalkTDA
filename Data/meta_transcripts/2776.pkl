VIn 1956, a documentary by Jacques Cousteau won
p4
aVboth the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.
p5
aVThis film was called, "Le Monde Du Silence,"
p6
aVor, "The Silent World."
p7
aVThe premise of the title was that the underwater world was a quiet world.
p8
aVWe now know, 60 years later,
p9
aVthat the underwater world is anything but silent.
p10
aa(lp11
VAlthough the sounds are inaudible above water
p12
aVdepending on where you are and the time of year,
p13
aVthe underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or rainforest.
p14
aVInvertebrates like snapping shrimp, fish and marine mammals
p15
aVall use sound.
p16
aVThey use sound to study their habitat,
p17
aVto keep in communication with each other,
p18
aVto navigate,
p19
aVto detect predators and prey.
p20
aVThey also use sound by listening to know something about their environment.
p21
aa(lp22
VTake, for an example, the Arctic.
p23
aVIt's considered a vast, inhospitable place,
p24
aVsometimes described as a desert,
p25
aVbecause it is so cold and so remote
p26
aVand ice-covered for much of the year.
p27
aVAnd despite this,
p28
aVthere is no place on Earth that I would rather be than the Arctic,
p29
aVespecially as days lengthen and spring comes.
p30
aa(lp31
VTo me, the Arctic really embodies this disconnect
p32
aVbetween what we see on the surface and what's going on underwater.
p33
aVYou can look out across the ice \u2014 all white and blue and cold \u2014
p34
aVand see nothing.
p35
aVBut if you could hear underwater,
p36
aVthe sounds you would hear would at first amaze
p37
aVand then delight you.
p38
aVAnd while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice,
p39
aVyour ears are telling you that out there are bowhead and beluga whales,
p40
aVwalrus and bearded seals.
p41
aVThe ice, too, makes sounds.
p42
aVIt screeches and cracks and pops and groans,
p43
aVas it collides and rubs when temperature or currents or winds change.
p44
aVAnd under 100 percent sea ice in the dead of winter,
p45
aVbowhead whales are singing.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd you would never expect that,
p48
aVbecause we humans,
p49
aVwe tend to be very visual animals.
p50
aVFor most of us, but not all,
p51
aVour sense of sight is how we navigate our world.
p52
aVFor marine mammals that live underwater,
p53
aVwhere chemical cues and light transmit poorly,
p54
aVsound is the sense by which they see.
p55
aVAnd sound transmits very well underwater,
p56
aVmuch better than it does in air,
p57
aVso signals can be heard over great distances.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn the Arctic, this is especially important,
p60
aVbecause not only do Arctic marine mammals have to hear each other,
p61
aVbut they also have to listen for cues in the environment
p62
aVthat might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water.
p63
aVRemember, although they spend most of their lives underwater,
p64
aVthey are mammals,
p65
aVand so they have to surface to breathe.
p66
aVSo they might listen for thin ice or no ice,
p67
aVor listen for echoes off nearby ice.
p68
aa(lp69
VArctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape.
p70
aVIn the spring,
p71
aVit can be a cacophony of sound.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Marine mammal sounds)
p74
aa(lp75
VBut when the ice is frozen solid,
p76
aVand there are no big temperature shifts or current changes,
p77
aVthe underwater Arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels
p78
aVof the world's oceans.
p79
aVBut this is changing.
p80
aVThis is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice,
p81
aVwhich is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions.
p82
aVWe are, in effect, with climate change,
p83
aVconducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet.
p84
aa(lp85
VOver the past 30 years,
p86
aVareas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice
p87
aVfrom anywhere from six weeks to four months.
p88
aVThis decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to as an increase
p89
aVin the open water season.
p90
aVThat is the time of year when the Arctic is navigable to vessels.
p91
aVAnd not only is the extent of ice changing,
p92
aVbut the age and the width of ice is, too.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, you may well have heard
p95
aVthat a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat
p96
aVfor animals that rely on sea ice,
p97
aVsuch as ice seals, or walrus, or polar bears.
p98
aVDecreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages,
p99
aVand changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals.
p100
aa(lp101
VClimate change and decreases in sea ice
p102
aVare also altering the underwater soundscape of the Arctic.
p103
aVWhat do I mean by soundscape?
p104
aVThose of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living
p105
aVuse instruments called hydrophones,
p106
aVwhich are underwater microphones,
p107
aVand we record ambient noise \u2014
p108
aVthe noise all around us.
p109
aVAnd the soundscape describes the different contributors
p110
aVto this noise field.
p111
aVWhat we are hearing on our hydrophones
p112
aVare the very real sounds of climate change.
p113
aVWe are hearing these changes from three fronts:
p114
aVfrom the air,
p115
aVfrom the water
p116
aVand from land.
p117
aa(lp118
VFirst: air.
p119
aVWind on water creates waves.
p120
aVThese waves make bubbles;
p121
aVthe bubbles break,
p122
aVand when they do,
p123
aVthey make noise.
p124
aVAnd this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background.
p125
aVIn the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,
p126
aVmost of the noise from wind doesn't make it into the water column,
p127
aVbecause the ice acts as a buffer between the atmosphere and the water.
p128
aVThis is one of the reasons
p129
aVthat the Arctic can have very low ambient noise levels.
p130
aVBut with decreases in seasonal sea ice,
p131
aVnot only is the Arctic now open to this wave noise,
p132
aVbut the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the Arctic
p133
aVhas been increasing.
p134
aVAll of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean.
p135
aa(lp136
VSecond: water.
p137
aVWith less seasonal sea ice,
p138
aVsubarctic species are moving north,
p139
aVand taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water.
p140
aVNow, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,
p141
aVthey have no dorsal fin,
p142
aVbecause they have evolved to live and swim in ice-covered waters,
p143
aVand having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive
p144
aVto migrating through ice,
p145
aVand may, in fact, be excluding animals from the ice.
p146
aVBut now, everywhere we've listened,
p147
aVwe're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales
p148
aVand killer whales,
p149
aVfurther and further north,
p150
aVand later and later in the season.
p151
aVWe are hearing, in essence,
p152
aVan invasion of the Arctic by subarctic species.
p153
aVAnd we don't know what this means.
p154
aVWill there be competition for food between Arctic and subarctic animals?
p155
aVMight these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the Arctic?
p156
aVAnd what are the new sounds that they are producing
p157
aVdoing to the soundscape underwater?
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd third: land.
p160
aVAnd by land ...
p161
aVI mean people.
p162
aVMore open water means increased human use of the Arctic.
p163
aVJust this past summer,
p164
aVa massive cruise ship made its way through the Northwest Passage \u2014
p165
aVthe once-mythical route between Europe and the Pacific.
p166
aVDecreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the Arctic more often.
p167
aVIt has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction,
p168
aVthe potential for commercial shipping,
p169
aVas well as increased tourism.
p170
aVAnd we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales
p171
aVand can disrupt feeding behavior.
p172
aVAir guns, which produce loud, low-frequency "whoomps"
p173
aVevery 10 to 20 seconds,
p174
aVchanged the swimming and vocal behavior of whales.
p175
aVAnd all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space
p176
aVover which Arctic marine mammals can communicate.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, Arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise
p179
aVat certain times of the year.
p180
aVBut this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice,
p181
aVand these are the sounds with which they've evolved,
p182
aVand these are sounds that are vital to their very survival.
p183
aVThese new sounds are loud and they're alien.
p184
aVThey might impact the environment in ways that we think we understand,
p185
aVbut also in ways that we don't.
p186
aVRemember, sound is the most important sense for these animals.
p187
aVAnd not only is the physical habitat of the Arctic changing rapidly,
p188
aVbut the acoustic habitat is, too.
p189
aVIt's as if we've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside
p190
aVand dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour.
p191
aVAnd they can't escape it.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what can we do now?
p194
aVWe can't decrease wind speeds
p195
aVor keep subarctic animals from migrating north,
p196
aVbut we can work on local solutions
p197
aVto reducing human-caused underwater noise.
p198
aVOne of these solutions is to slow down ships
p199
aVthat traverse the Arctic,
p200
aVbecause a slower ship is a quieter ship.
p201
aVWe can restrict access in seasons and regions
p202
aVthat are important for mating or feeding or migrating.
p203
aVWe can get smarter about quieting ships
p204
aVand find better ways to explore the ocean bottom.
p205
aVAnd the good news is,
p206
aVthere are people working on this right now.
p207
aVBut ultimately,
p208
aVwe humans have to do the hard work
p209
aVof reversing or at the very least decelerating
p210
aVhuman-caused atmospheric changes.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, let's return to this idea of a silent world underwater.
p213
aVIt's entirely possible
p214
aVthat many of the whales swimming in the Arctic today,
p215
aVespecially long-lived species like the bowhead whale
p216
aVthat the Inuits say can live two human lives \u2014
p217
aVit's possible that these whales were alive in 1956,
p218
aVwhen Jacques Cousteau made his film.
p219
aVAnd in retrospect,
p220
aVconsidering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today,
p221
aVperhaps it really was "The Silent World."
