VI just want to share with you
p4
aVwhat I have been experiencing over the last five years
p5
aVin having the great privilege of traveling
p6
aVto many of the poorest countries in the world.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis scene is one I see all the time everywhere,
p9
aVand these young children are looking at a smartphone,
p10
aVand the smartphone is having a huge impact in even the poorest countries.
p11
aVI said to my team, you know,
p12
aVwhat I see is a rise in aspirations all over the world.
p13
aVIn fact, it seems to me that there's a convergence of aspirations.
p14
aVAnd I asked a team of economists to actually look into this.
p15
aVIs this true?
p16
aVAre aspirations converging all around the world?
p17
aVSo they looked at things like Gallup polls about satisfaction in life
p18
aVand what they learned was that if you have access to the internet,
p19
aVyour satisfaction goes up.
p20
aVBut another thing happens that's very important:
p21
aVyour reference income,
p22
aVthe income to which you compare your own,
p23
aValso goes up.
p24
aVNow, if the reference income of a nation, for example,
p25
aVgoes up 10 percent
p26
aVby comparing themselves to the outside,
p27
aVthen on average,
p28
aVpeople's own incomes have to go up at least five percent
p29
aVto maintain the same level of satisfaction.
p30
aVBut when you get down into the lower percentiles of income,
p31
aVyour income has to go up much more
p32
aVif the reference income goes up 10 percent,
p33
aVsomething like 20 percent.
p34
aVAnd so with this rise of aspirations,
p35
aVthe fundamental question is:
p36
aVAre we going to have a situation
p37
aVwhere aspirations are linked to opportunity
p38
aVand you get dynamism and economic growth,
p39
aVlike that which happened in the country I was born in, in Korea?
p40
aVOr are aspirations going to meet frustration?
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is a real concern, because between 2012 and 2015,
p43
aVterrorism incidents increased by 74 percent.
p44
aVThe number of deaths from terrorism went up 150 percent.
p45
aVRight now, two billion people
p46
aVlive in conditions of fragility, conflict, violence,
p47
aVand by 2030, more than 60 percent of the world's poor
p48
aVwill live in these situations of fragility, conflict and violence.
p49
aVAnd so what do we do about meeting these aspirations?
p50
aVAre there new ways of thinking
p51
aVabout how we can rise to meet these aspirations?
p52
aVBecause if we don't, I'm extremely worried.
p53
aVAspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet.
p54
aVEveryone knows how everyone else lives.
p55
aVHas our ability to meet those aspirations
p56
aVrisen as well?
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd just to get at the details of this,
p59
aVI want to share with you my own personal story.
p60
aVThis is not my mother,
p61
aVbut during the Korean War,
p62
aVmy mother literally took her own sister,
p63
aVher younger sister, on her back,
p64
aVand walked at least part of the way
p65
aVto escape Seoul during the Korean War.
p66
aVNow, through a series of miracles,
p67
aVmy mother and father both got scholarships to go to New York City.
p68
aVThey actually met in New York City and got married in New York City.
p69
aVMy father, too, was a refugee.
p70
aVAt the age of 19, he left his family in the northern part of the country,
p71
aVescaped through the border
p72
aVand never saw his family again.
p73
aVNow, when they were married and living in New York,
p74
aVmy father was a waiter at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.
p75
aVTheir aspirations went up.
p76
aVThey understood what it was like to live in a place like New York City
p77
aVin the 1950s.
p78
aa(lp79
VWell, my brother was born and they came back to Korea,
p80
aVand we had what I remember as kind of an idyllic life,
p81
aVbut what was happening in Korea at that time
p82
aVwas the country was one of the poorest in the world
p83
aVand there was political upheaval.
p84
aVThere were demonstrations just down the street from our house all the time,
p85
aVstudents protesting against the military government.
p86
aVAnd at the time,
p87
aVthe aspirations of the World Bank Group, the organization I lead now,
p88
aVwere extremely low for Korea.
p89
aVTheir idea was that Korea would find it difficult without foreign aid
p90
aVto provide its people with more than the bare necessities of life.
p91
aVSo the situation is Korea is in a tough position,
p92
aVmy parents have seen what life is like in the United States.
p93
aVThey got married there. My brother was born there.
p94
aVAnd they felt that in order to give us an opportunity
p95
aVto reach their aspirations for us,
p96
aVwe had to go and come back to the United States.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, we came back.
p99
aVFirst we went to Dallas.
p100
aVMy father did his dental degree all over again.
p101
aVAnd then we ended up moving to Iowa, of all places.
p102
aVWe grew up in Iowa.
p103
aVAnd in Iowa, we went through the whole course.
p104
aVI went to high school, I went to college.
p105
aVAnd then one day, something that I'll never forget,
p106
aVmy father picked me up after my sophomore year in college,
p107
aVand he was driving me home,
p108
aVand he said, "Jim, what are your aspirations?
p109
aVWhat do you want to study? What do you want to do?"
p110
aVAnd I said, "Dad," \u2014
p111
aVMy mother actually was a philosopher, and had filled us with ideas
p112
aVabout protest and social justice,
p113
aVand I said, "Dad, I'm going to study political science and philosophy,
p114
aVand I'm going to become part of a political movement."
p115
aVMy father, the Korean dentist,
p116
aVslowly pulled the car over to the side of the road \u2014
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VHe looked back at me, and he said,
p121
aV"Jim, you finish your medical residency, you can study anything you want."
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, I've told this story to a mostly Asian audience before.
p126
aVNobody laughs. They just shake their head.
p127
aVOf course.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, tragically, my father died at a young age,
p134
aV30 years ago at the age of 57,
p135
aVwhat happens to be how old I am right now,
p136
aVand when he died in the middle of my medical and graduate studies \u2014
p137
aVYou see, I actually got around it by doing medicine and anthropology.
p138
aVI studied both of them in graduate school.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut then right about that time, I met these two people,
p141
aVOphelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.
p142
aVAnd Paul and I were in the same program.
p143
aVWe were studying medicine
p144
aVand at the same time getting our PhD's in anthropology.
p145
aVAnd we began to ask some pretty fundamental questions.
p146
aVFor people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology \u2014
p147
aVI had come from parents who were refugees.
p148
aVPaul grew up literally in a bus in a swamp in Florida.
p149
aVHe liked to call himself "white trash."
p150
aVAnd so we had this opportunity
p151
aVand we said,
p152
aVwhat is it that we need to do?
p153
aVGiven our ridiculously elaborate educations,
p154
aVwhat is the nature of our responsibility to the world?
p155
aVAnd we decided that we needed to start an organization.
p156
aVIt's called Partners in Health.
p157
aVAnd by the way, there's a movie made about that.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VThere's a movie that was just a brilliant movie
p162
aVthey made about it called "Bending the Arc."
p163
aVIt launched at Sundance this past January.
p164
aVJeff Skoll is here.
p165
aVJeff is one of the ones who made it happen.
p166
aVAnd we began to think about what it would take for us
p167
aVto actually have our aspirations reach the level
p168
aVof some of the poorest communities in the world.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is my very first visit to Haiti in 1988,
p171
aVand in 1988, we elaborated a sort of mission statement,
p172
aVwhich is we are going to make a preferential option for the poor
p173
aVin health.
p174
aVNow, it took us a long time, and we were graduate students in anthropology.
p175
aVWe were reading up one side of Marx and down the other.
p176
aVHabermas. Fernand Braudel.
p177
aVWe were reading everything
p178
aVand we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work?
p179
aVSo "O for the P," we called it,
p180
aVa preferential option for the poor.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe most important thing about a preferential option for the poor
p183
aVis what it's not.
p184
aVIt's not a preferential option for your own sense of heroism.
p185
aVIt's not a preferential option
p186
aVfor your own idea about how to lift the poor out of poverty.
p187
aVIt's not a preferential option for your own organization.
p188
aVAnd the hardest of all,
p189
aVit's not a preferential option for your poor.
p190
aVIt's a preferential option for the poor.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what do you do?
p193
aVWell, Haiti, we started building \u2014
p194
aVEveryone told us, the cost-effective thing
p195
aVis just focus on vaccination and maybe a feeding program.
p196
aVBut what the Haitians wanted was a hospital.
p197
aVThey wanted schools.
p198
aVThey wanted to provide their children with the opportunities
p199
aVthat they'd been hearing about from others, relatives, for example,
p200
aVwho had gone to the United States.
p201
aVThey wanted the same kinds of opportunities as my parents did.
p202
aVI recognized them.
p203
aVAnd so that's what we did. We built hospitals.
p204
aVWe provided education.
p205
aVAnd we did everything we could to try to give them opportunities.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, my experience really became intense
p208
aVat Partners in Health in this community, Carabayllo,
p209
aVin the northern slums of Lima, Peru.
p210
aVAnd in this community,
p211
aVwe started out by really just going to people's homes and talking to people,
p212
aVand we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
p213
aVThis is Melquiades.
p214
aVMelquiades was a patient at that time, he was about 18 years old,
p215
aVand he had a very difficult form of drug-resistant tuberculosis.
p216
aVAll of the gurus in the world, the global health gurus,
p217
aVsaid it is not cost-effective to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.
p218
aVIt's too complicated. It's too expensive.
p219
aVYou just can't do it. It can't be done.
p220
aVAnd in addition, they were getting angry at us,
p221
aVbecause the implication was
p222
aVif it could be done, we would have done it.
p223
aVWho do you think you are?
p224
aVAnd the people that we fought with were the World Health Organization
p225
aVand probably the organization we fought with most
p226
aVwas the World Bank Group.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, we did everything we could
p229
aVto convince Melquiades to take his medicines,
p230
aVbecause it's really hard,
p231
aVand not once during the time of treatment did Melquiades's family ever say,
p232
aV"Hey, you know, Melquiades is just not cost-effective.
p233
aVWhy don't you go on and treat somebody else?"
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VI hadn't seen Melquiades for about 10 years
p238
aVand when we had our annual meetings in Lima, Peru
p239
aVa couple of years ago,
p240
aVthe filmmakers found him
p241
aVand here is us getting together.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VHe has become a bit of a media star because he goes to the film openings,
p246
aVand he knows how to work an audience now.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VBut as soon as we won \u2014
p251
aVWe did win. We won the argument.
p252
aVYou should treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis \u2014
p253
aVwe heard the same arguments in the early 2000s about HIV.
p254
aVAll of the leading global health people in the world said
p255
aVit is impossible to treat HIV in poor countries.
p256
aVToo expensive, too complicated, you can't do it.
p257
aVCompared to drug-resistant TB treatment,
p258
aVit's actually easier.
p259
aVAnd we were seeing patients like this.
p260
aVJoseph Jeune.
p261
aVJoseph Jeune also never mentioned that he was not cost-effective.
p262
aVA few months of medicines, and this is what he looked like.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VWe call that the Lazarus Effect of HIV treatment.
p267
aVJoseline came to us looking like this.
p268
aVThis is what she looked like a few months later.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, our argument, our battle, we thought,
p273
aVwas with the organizations that kept saying it's not cost-effective.
p274
aVWe were saying, no,
p275
aVpreferential option for the poor requires us to raise our aspirations
p276
aVto meet those of the poor for themselves.
p277
aVAnd they said, well, that's a nice thought but it's just not cost-effective.
p278
aVSo in the nerdy way that we have operated Partners in Health,
p279
aVwe wrote a book against, basically, the World Bank.
p280
aVIt says that because the World Bank
p281
aVhas focused so much on just economic growth
p282
aVand said that governments have to shrink their budgets
p283
aVand reduce expenditures in health, education and social welfare \u2014
p284
aVwe thought that was fundamentally wrong.
p285
aVAnd we argued with the World Bank.
p286
aVAnd then a crazy thing happened.
p287
aVPresident Obama nominated me to be President of the World Bank.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, when I went to do the vetting process with President Obama's team,
p292
aVthey had a copy of "Dying For Growth," and they had read every page.
p293
aVAnd I said, "OK, that's it, right?
p294
aVYou guys are going to drop me?"
p295
aVHe goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK."
p296
aVAnd I was nominated,
p297
aVand I walked through the door of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,
p298
aVand that statement on the wall, "Our dream is a world free of poverty."
p299
aVA few months after that, we actually turned it into a goal:
p300
aVend extreme poverty by 2030,
p301
aVboost shared prosperity.
p302
aVThat's what we do now at the World Bank Group.
p303
aVI feel like I have brought the preferential option for the poor
p304
aVto the World Bank Group.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VBut this is TED,
p309
aVand so I want to share with you some concerns,
p310
aVand then make a proposal.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe Fourth Industrial Revolution,
p313
aVnow, you guys know so much better than I do,
p314
aVbut here's the thing that concerns me.
p315
aVWhat we hear about is job loss. You've all heard that.
p316
aVOur own data suggest to us that two thirds of all jobs,
p317
aVcurrently existing jobs in developing countries,
p318
aVwill be lost because of automation.
p319
aVNow, you've got to make up for those jobs.
p320
aVNow, one of the ways to make up for those jobs
p321
aVis to turn community health workers into a formal labor force.
p322
aVThat's what we want to do.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VWe think the numbers will work out,
p327
aVthat as health outcomes get better and as people have formal work,
p328
aVwe're going to be able to train them
p329
aVwith the soft-skills training that you add to it
p330
aVto become workers that will have a huge impact,
p331
aVand that may be the one area that grows the most.
p332
aa(lp333
VBut here's the other thing that bothers me:
p334
aVright now it seems pretty clear to me that the jobs of the future
p335
aVwill be more digitally demanding,
p336
aVand there is a crisis in childhood stunting.
p337
aVSo these are photos from Charles Nelson, who shared these with us
p338
aVfrom Harvard Medical School.
p339
aVAnd what these photos show on the one side, on the left side,
p340
aVis a three-month-old who has been stunted:
p341
aVnot adequate nutrition, not adequate stimulation.
p342
aVAnd on the other side, of course, is a normal child,
p343
aVand the normal child has all of these neuronal connections.
p344
aVNow, the neuronal connections are important,
p345
aVbecause that is the definition of human capital.
p346
aVNow, we know that we can reduce these rates.
p347
aVWe can reduce these rates of childhood stunting quickly,
p348
aVbut if we don't, India, for example, with 38 percent childhood stunting,
p349
aVhow are they going to compete in the economy of the future
p350
aVif 40 percent of their future workers cannot achieve educationally
p351
aVand certainly we worry about achieving economically
p352
aVin a way that will help the country as a whole grow.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow, what are we going to do?
p355
aV78 trillion dollars is the size of the global economy.
p356
aV8.55 trillion dollars are sitting in negative interest rate bonds.
p357
aVThat means that you give the German central bank your money
p358
aVand then you pay them to keep your money.
p359
aVThat's a negative interest rate bond.
p360
aV24.4 trillion dollars in very low-earning government bonds.
p361
aVAnd 8 trillion literally sitting in the hands of rich people
p362
aVunder their very large mattresses.
p363
aVWhat we are trying to do is now use our own tools \u2014
p364
aVand just to get nerdy for a second,
p365
aVwe're talking about first-loss risk debt instruments,
p366
aVwe're talking about derisking, blended finance,
p367
aVwe're talking about political risk insurance,
p368
aVcredit enhancement \u2014
p369
aVall these things that I've now learned at the World Bank Group
p370
aVthat rich people use every single day to make themselves richer,
p371
aVbut we haven't used aggressively enough on behalf of the poor
p372
aVto bring this capital in.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VSo does this work?
p377
aVCan you actually bring private-sector players into a country
p378
aVand really make things work?
p379
aVWell, we've done it a couple of times.
p380
aVThis is Zambia, Scaling Solar.
p381
aVIt's a box-set solution from the World Bank
p382
aVwhere we come in and we do all the things you need
p383
aVto attract private-sector investors.
p384
aVAnd in this case, Zambia went from having a cost of electricity
p385
aVat 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,
p386
aVand by just doing simple things, doing the auction,
p387
aVchanging some policies,
p388
aVwe were able to bring the cost down.
p389
aVLowest bid,
p390
aV25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?
p391
aVThe lowest bid was 4.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VBut here's my proposal for you.
p396
aVThis is from a group called Zipline,
p397
aVa cool company, and they literally are rocket scientists.
p398
aVThey figured out how to use drones in Rwanda.
p399
aVThis is me launching a drone in Rwanda
p400
aVthat delivers blood anywhere in the country
p401
aVin less than an hour.
p402
aVSo we save lives,
p403
aVthis program saved lives \u2014
p404
aa(lp405
V(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VThis program made money for Zipline
p408
aVand this program saved huge amounts of money for Rwanda.
p409
aVThat's what we need, and we need that from all of you.
p410
aVI'm asking you, carve out a little bit of time in your brains
p411
aVto think about the technology that you work on,
p412
aVthe companies that you start, the design that you do.
p413
aVThink a little bit and work with us
p414
aVto see if we can come up with these kinds of extraordinary win-win solutions.
p415
aa(lp416
VI'm going to leave you with one final story.
p417
aVI was in Tanzania, and I was in a classroom.
p418
aVThis is me with a classroom of 11-year-olds.
p419
aVAnd I asked them, as I always do,
p420
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p421
aVTwo raised their hands and said,
p422
aV"I want to be President of the World Bank."
p423
aa(lp424
V(Laughter)
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd just like you, my own team and their teachers laughed.
p427
aVBut then I stopped them.
p428
aVI said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.
p429
aVWhen I was born in South Korea, this is what it looked like.
p430
aVThis is where I came from.
p431
aVAnd when I was three years old,
p432
aVin preschool,
p433
aVI don't think that George David Woods, the President of the World Bank,
p434
aVif he had visited Korea on that day and come to my classroom,
p435
aVthat he would have thought
p436
aVthat the future President of the World Bank
p437
aVwas sitting in that classroom.
p438
aVDon't let anyone ever tell you
p439
aVthat you cannot be President of the World Bank."
p440
aa(lp441
VNow \u2014 thank you.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Applause)
p444
aa(lp445
VLet me leave you with one thought.
p446
aVI came from a country that was the poorest in the world.
p447
aVI'm President of the World Bank.
p448
aVI cannot and I will not pull up the ladder behind me.
p449
aVThis is urgent.
p450
aVAspirations are going up.
p451
aVEverywhere aspirations are going up.
p452
aVYou folks in this room, work with us.
p453
aVWe know that we can find those Zipline-type solutions
p454
aVand help the poor leapfrog into a better world,
p455
aVbut it won't happen until we work together.
p456
aVThe future "you" \u2014 and especially for your children \u2014
p457
aVthe future you
p458
aVwill depend on how much care and compassion we bring
p459
aVto ensuring that the future "us" provides equality of opportunity
p460
aVfor every child in the world.
p461
aa(lp462
VThank you very much.
p463
aa(lp464
V(Applause)
p465
aa(lp466
VThank you. Thank you. Thank you.
p467

VChris Anderson: You'd almost think
p471
aVpeople are surprised to hear a talk like this
p472
aVfrom the President of the World Bank.
p473
aVIt's kind of cool.
p474
aVI'd encourage you to even be a little more specific on your proposal.
p475
aVThere's many investors, entrepreneurs in this room.
p476
aVHow will you partner with them? What's your proposal?
p477
aa(lp478
VJim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy for just a second.
p479
aa(lp480
VCA: Get nerdy. Absolutely. JYK: So here's what we did.
p481
aVInsurance companies never invest in developing country infrastructure,
p482
aVfor example, because they can't take the risk.
p483
aVThey're holding money for people who pay for insurance.
p484
aVSo what we did was a Swedish International Development Association
p485
aVgave us a little bit of money,
p486
aVwe went out and raised a little bit more money, a hundred million,
p487
aVand we took first loss, meaning if this thing goes bad,
p488
aV10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,
p489
aVand the rest of you will be safe.
p490
aVAnd that created a 90-percent chunk, tranche
p491
aVthat was triple B, investment-grade, so the insurance companies invested.
p492
aVSo for us, what we're doing is taking our public money
p493
aVand using it to derisk specific instruments
p494
aVto bring people in from the outside.
p495
aVSo all of you who are sitting on trillions of dollars of cash,
p496
aVcome to us. Right?
p497
aa(lp498
V(Laughter)
p499
aa(lp500
VCA: And what you're specifically looking for are investment proposals
p501
aVthat create employment in the developing world.
p502
aa(lp503
VJYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.
p504
aVSo these will be, for example, in infrastructure that brings energy,
p505
aVbuilds roads, bridges, ports.
p506
aVThese kinds of things are necessary to create jobs,
p507
aVbut also what we're saying is
p508
aVyou may think that the technology you're working on
p509
aVor the business that you're working on
p510
aVmay not have applications in the developing world,
p511
aVbut look at Zipline.
p512
aVAnd that Zipline thing didn't happen
p513
aVjust because of the quality of the technology.
p514
aVIt was because they engaged with the Rwandans early
p515
aVand used artificial intelligence \u2014
p516
aVone thing, Rwanda has great broadband \u2014
p517
aVbut these things fly completely on their own.
p518
aVSo we will help you do that. We will make the introductions.
p519
aVWe will even provide financing. We will help you do that.
p520
aa(lp521
VCA: How much capital is the World Bank willing to deploy
p522
aVto back those kinds of efforts?
p523
aa(lp524
VJYK: Chris, you're always getting me to try to do something like this.
p525
aa(lp526
VCA: I'm trying to get you in trouble. JYK: So here's what we're going to do.
p527
aVWe have 25 billion a year that we're investing in poor countries,
p528
aVthe poorest countries.
p529
aVAnd as we invest over the next three years,
p530
aV25 billion a year,
p531
aVwe have got to think with you
p532
aVabout how to use that money more effectively.
p533
aVSo I can't give you a specific number. It depends on the quality of the ideas.
p534
aVSo bring us your ideas,
p535
aVand I don't think that financing is going to be the problem.
p536
aa(lp537
VCA: All right, you heard it from the man himself.
p538
aa(lp539
VJim, thanks so much. JYK: Thank you. Thank you.
