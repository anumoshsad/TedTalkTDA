VIt's wonderful to be here
p4
aVto talk about my journey,
p5
aVto talk about the wheelchair
p6
aVand the freedom it has bought me.
p7
aa(lp8
VI started using a wheelchair 16 years ago
p9
aVwhen an extended illness
p10
aVchanged the way I could access the world.
p11
aVWhen I started using the wheelchair,
p12
aVit was a tremendous new freedom.
p13
aVI'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.
p14
aVIt was like having an enormous new toy.
p15
aVI could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
p16
aVJust being out on the street was exhilarating.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,
p19
aVpeople's reaction completely changed towards me.
p20
aVIt was as if they couldn't see me anymore,
p21
aVas if an invisibility cloak had descended.
p22
aVThey seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions
p23
aVof what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.
p24
aVWhen I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,
p25
aVthey used words like "limitation," "fear,"
p26
aV"pity" and "restriction."
p27
aVI realized I'd internalized these responses
p28
aVand it had changed who I was on a core level.
p29
aVA part of me had become alienated from myself.
p30
aVI was seeing myself not from my perspective,
p31
aVbut vividly and continuously from the perspective
p32
aVof other people's responses to me.
p33
aa(lp34
VAs a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories
p35
aVabout this experience,
p36
aVnew narratives to reclaim my identity.

aa(lp40
VI started making work
p41
aVthat aimed to communicate something
p42
aVof the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair \u2014
p43
aVa power chair \u2014 to negotiate the world.
p44
aVI was working to transform these internalized responses,
p45
aVto transform the preconceptions that had so shaped
p46
aVmy identity when I started using a wheelchair,
p47
aVby creating unexpected images.
p48
aVThe wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
p49
aVWhen I literally started leaving
p50
aVtraces of my joy and freedom,
p51
aVit was exciting to see
p52
aVthe interested and surprised responses from people.
p53
aVIt seemed to open up new perspectives,
p54
aVand therein lay the paradigm shift.
p55
aVIt showed that an arts practice
p56
aVcan remake one's identity
p57
aVand transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo when I began to dive, in 2005,
p60
aVI realized scuba gear extends your range of activity
p61
aVin just the same way as a wheelchair does,
p62
aVbut the associations attached to scuba gear
p63
aVare ones of excitement and adventure,
p64
aVcompletely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I thought, "I wonder what'll happen
p67
aVif I put the two together?" (Laughter) (Applause)
p68
aVAnd the underwater wheelchair that has resulted
p69
aVhas taken me on the most amazing journey
p70
aVover the last seven years.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo to give you an idea of what that's like,
p73
aVI'd like to share with you one of the outcomes
p74
aVfrom creating this spectacle,
p75
aVand show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Music)
p78
aa(lp79
V(Applause)
p80
aa(lp81
VIt is the most amazing experience,
p82
aVbeyond most other things I've experienced in life.
p83
aVI literally have the freedom to move
p84
aVin 360 degrees of space
p85
aVand an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd the incredibly unexpected thing
p88
aVis that other people seem to see and feel that too.
p89
aVTheir eyes literally light up,
p90
aVand they say things like, "I want one of those,"
p91
aVor, "If you can do that, I can do anything."
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd I'm thinking, it's because in that moment
p94
aVof them seeing an object
p95
aVthey have no frame of reference for,
p96
aVor so transcends the frames of reference
p97
aVthey have with the wheelchair,
p98
aVthey have to think in a completely new way.
p99
aVAnd I think that moment of completely new thought
p100
aVperhaps creates a freedom
p101
aVthat spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
p102
aVFor me, this means that they're seeing
p103
aVthe value of difference,
p104
aVthe joy it brings
p105
aVwhen instead of focusing on loss or limitation,
p106
aVwe see and discover the power and joy
p107
aVof seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
p108
aVFor me, the wheelchair becomes
p109
aVa vehicle for transformation.
p110
aVIn fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal,"
p111
aVbecause it's literally pushed me through
p112
aVinto a new way of being,
p113
aVinto new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd the other thing is,
p116
aVthat because nobody's seen or heard
p117
aVof an underwater wheelchair before,
p118
aVand creating this spectacle is about creating
p119
aVnew ways of seeing, being and knowing,
p120
aVnow you have this concept in your mind.
p121
aVYou're all part of the artwork too.
