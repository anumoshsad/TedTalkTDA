VYou will understand nothing with my type of English.
p4
aVIt's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.
p5
aVI must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,
p6
aVbecause usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.
p7
aVI mean, I feel useless.
p8
aVNow after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.
p9
aVAnd definitively, I don't know why I am here,
p10
aVbut \u2014 you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,
p11
aVyou arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"
p12
aVI don't know. (Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say,
p15
aVwe shall try to speak about something else.
p16
aVWe can start, if you want, by understanding \u2014
p17
aVit's just to start, it's not interesting, but \u2014 how I work.
p18
aVWhen somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,
p19
aVI mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,
p20
aVand why not \u2014 a toothbrush?
p21
aVI don't try to design the toothbrush.
p22
aVI don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.
p23
aVThat doesn't interest me.
p24
aa(lp25
VBecause there is different types of design.
p26
aVThe one, we can call it the cynical design,
p27
aVthat means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,
p28
aVwho said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.
p29
aVIt means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,
p30
aVfor producer to make product more sexy, like that,
p31
aVthey sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.
p32
aVI call that the cynical design.
p33
aa(lp34
VAfter, there is the narcissistic design:
p35
aVit's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter)
p36
aVAfter, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,
p37
aVand who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,
p38
aVand they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,
p39
aVfor the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.
p40
aVIf we take the toothbrush \u2014 I don't think about the toothbrush.
p41
aVI think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?"
p42
aVAnd to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,
p43
aVI must imagine: Who owns this mouth?
p44
aVWhat is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?
p45
aVWhat civilization creates this society?
p46
aVWhat animal species creates this civilization?
p47
aVWhen I arrive \u2014 and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent \u2014
p48
aVwhen I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.
p49
aa(lp50
VMe, I have strictly no power to change anything.
p51
aVBut when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,
p52
aVbecause today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.
p53
aVBut to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.
p54
aVThere is things to see, there is the big challenge.
p55
aVThe big challenge in front of us.
p56
aVBecause there is not a human production
p57
aVwhich exists outside of what I call "the big image."
p58
aVThe big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.
p59
aVOur poetry is our mutation, our life.
p60
aVWe must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,
p61
aVthat life appears four billion years ago, around \u2014 four billion point two?
p62
aa(lp63
VVoice offstage: Four point five.
p64
aa(lp65
VYes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer,
p66
aVthat's all, of Christmas gifts.
p67
aVAnd before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,"
p68
aVthis first soup \u2014 bloop bloop bloop \u2014
p69
aVsort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.
p70
aVSo then \u2014 pshoo-shoo \u2014 lightning \u2014 pshoo \u2014 arrive \u2014
p71
aVpshoo-shoo \u2014 makes life \u2014 bloop bloop \u2014 and that dies.
p72
aVSome million years after \u2014 pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop \u2014 ah, wake up!
p73
aVAt the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.
p74
aVWe was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.
p75
aVEven, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,
p76
aVand something of \u2014 oh no, forget it.
p77
aa(lp78
VAfter, we become a fish; after, we become a frog;
p79
aVafter, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,
p80
aVand the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.
p81
aVCan you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,
p82
aVwith a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.
p83
aVAnd we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,
p84
aVthe earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,
p85
aVand this is scheduled for four, four billion years?
p86
aVYes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.
p87
aVFantastic! It's a beauty!
p88
aVCan you imagine? It's very symbolic.
p89
aVBecause the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.
p90
aVAnd today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.
p91
aVAnd this territory is fantastic.
p92
aa(lp93
VThat is our poetry. That is our beautiful story.
p94
aVIt's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.
p95
aVAnd if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,
p96
aVwe completely miss the story.
p97
aVBecause every generation thinks we are the final one.
p98
aVWe have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,
p99
aV"I am the man. The final man.
p100
aVYou know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)
p101
aVFor the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."
p102
aVSomething like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter)
p103
aVBecause that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
p104
aVThere is so many things to do; it's so fresh.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius,
p107
aVbut everybody is obliged to participate.
p108
aVAnd to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.
p109
aVWe can say that.
p110
aVThe first, if you want \u2014 there is so many \u2014
p111
aVbut one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.
p112
aVI can explain you. I shall try.
p113
aVIf you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,
p114
aVbut perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.
p115
aVAnd you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous.
p116
aa(lp117
VThat's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision.
p118
aVOK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.
p119
aVI raise the angle of vision, but it's still very \u2014 selfish, selfish, egoiste \u2014 yes, selfish.
p120
aVYou, you survive. It's OK.
p121
aVIf you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,
p122
aV"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,
p123
aVI can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.
p124
aVI live in society; I live in community.
p125
aVIt's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.
p126
aVFrom this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,
p127
aVthe more you will be important for the society.
p128
aVThe more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.
p129
aVThe more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,
p130
aVthe more you will be important for the story of our mutation.
p131
aVThat means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.
p132
aVFrom this to here, that, it's genius.
p133
aVPtolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.
p134
aVNobody's obliged to be a genius.
p135
aVIt's better, but nobody.
p136
aa(lp137
VTake care, in this training, to be a good mutant.
p138
aVThere is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.
p139
aVBecause at the vertical of us, if you look like that,
p140
aV"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"
p141
aVGod is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.
p142
aVThat means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,
p143
aVyou go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.
p144
aVThat's why \u2014 jump, like that? No, don't jump.
p145
aVCome back. Because, after, there is another trap.
p146
aVIf you look like that, you look to the past,
p147
aVor you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.
p148
aVIt's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also.
p149
aa(lp150
VThat's why every morning, now, because you are a good mutant,
p151
aVyou will raise your angle of view.
p152
aVOut, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.
p153
aVNever forget \u2014 like that, like that.
p154
aVIt's very, very, very important.
p155
aVWhat, what else we can say about that? Why do that?
p156
aVIt's because we \u2014 if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.
p157
aVThis line of evolution is clearly positive.
p158
aVFrom far, this line looks very smooth, like that.
p159
aVBut if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.
p160
aVIt's made of light and shadow.
p161
aVWe can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.
p162
aVAnd it's very important to know where we are.
p163
aVBecause some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,
p164
aVand you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.
p165
aa(lp166
VThat means, we can imagine \u2014 I don't say it was fantastic,
p167
aVbut in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was \u2014
p168
aVwe can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.
p169
aVIn this case, people like me are acceptable.
p170
aVWe can say, "It's luxurious time."
p171
aVWe have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,
p172
aVspeak about art and things like that.
p173
aVIt's OK. We are in the light.
p174
aVBut sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.
p175
aVWith many, many, many, many face of barbaria.
p176
aVBecause it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.
p177
aVThere is different type of barbaria.
p178
aVThat's why we must adapt.
p179
aVThat means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,
p180
aVforget design, even \u2014 I'm sorry to say \u2014 forget art.
p181
aVForget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.
p182
aVYou must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,
p183
aVI'm sorry if that's not very English.
p184
aVYou must go back to fight, to battle.
p185
aa(lp186
VThat's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.
p187
aVThat's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.
p188
aVBut I know that even I do it the best possible
p189
aV\u2014 that's why I'm the best \u2014 it's nothing.
p190
aVBecause it's not the right time.
p191
aVThat's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good reason,
p192
aVthe reason of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.
p193
aVAnd because we must all work to finish this story.
p194
aVBecause the scenario of this civilization
p195
aV\u2014 about love, progress, and things like that \u2014 it's OK,
p196
aVbut there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.
p197
aVThis scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,
p198
aVlike this idea we have invented, this concept of God.
p199
aVWe are God now. We are. It's almost done.
p200
aVWe have just to finish the story.
p201
aVThat is very, very important.
p202
aVAnd when you don't understand really what's happened,
p203
aVyou cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.
p204
aVYou go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.
p205
aVAnd you can fall, and it's very dangerous.
p206
aVNo, you must really understand that.
p207
aa(lp208
VBecause we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.
p209
aVAnd the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,
p210
aVand offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,
p211
aVa new poetry, a new romanticism.
p212
aVWith billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,
p213
aVthese people who have worked so much,
p214
aVwe have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.
p215
aVWe can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.
p216
aVNow you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.
p217
aVThe only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.
p218
aVWe give you white pages. Invent.
p219
aVWe give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.
p220
aVThat's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.
