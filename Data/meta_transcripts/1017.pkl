VWell, the subject of difficult negotiation
p4
aVreminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East,
p5
aVof a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels.
p6
aVTo the first son, he left half the camels;
p7
aVto the second son, he left a third of the camels;
p8
aVand to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels.
p9
aVThe three sons got into a negotiation \u2014 17 doesn't divide by two.
p10
aVIt doesn't divide by three.
p11
aVIt doesn't divide by nine.
p12
aVBrotherly tempers started to get strained.
p13
aVFinally, in desperation,
p14
aVthey went and they consulted a wise old woman.
p15
aVThe wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time,
p16
aVand finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you,
p17
aVbut at least, if you want, you can have my camel."
p18
aVSo then, they had 18 camels.
p19
aVThe first son took his half \u2014 half of 18 is nine.
p20
aVThe second son took his third \u2014 a third of 18 is six.
p21
aVThe youngest son took his ninth \u2014 a ninth of 18 is two.
p22
aVYou get 17.
p23
aVThey had one camel left over.
p24
aVThey gave it back to the wise old woman.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, if you think about that story for a moment,
p29
aVI think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations
p30
aVwe get involved in.
p31
aVThey start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it.
p32
aVSomehow, what we need to do
p33
aVis step back from those situations, like that wise old woman,
p34
aVlook at the situation through fresh eyes
p35
aVand come up with an 18th camel.
p36
aVFinding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts
p37
aVhas been my life passion.
p38
aa(lp39
VI basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers.
p40
aVWe're all one family.
p41
aVWe know that scientifically,
p42
aVthanks to the communications revolution,
p43
aVall the tribes on the planet \u2014 all 15,000 tribes \u2014
p44
aVare in touch with each other.
p45
aVAnd it's a big family reunion.
p46
aVAnd yet, like many family reunions,
p47
aVit's not all peace and light.
p48
aVThere's a lot of conflict,
p49
aVand the question is: How do we deal with our differences?
p50
aVHow do we deal with our deepest differences,
p51
aVgiven the human propensity for conflict
p52
aVand the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction?
p53
aVThat's the question.
p54
aa(lp55
VAs I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four,
p56
aVtraveling the world,
p57
aVtrying to work, getting involved in conflicts
p58
aVranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East
p59
aVto Chechnya to Venezuela \u2014
p60
aVsome of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet \u2014
p61
aVI've been asking myself that question.
p62
aVAnd I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace.
p63
aVIt's actually surprisingly simple.
p64
aVIt's not easy, but it's simple.
p65
aVIt's not even new.
p66
aVIt may be one of our most ancient human heritages.
p67
aVThe secret to peace is us.
p68
aVIt's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict,
p69
aVwho can play a constructive role.
p70
aa(lp71
VLet me give you just a story, an example.
p72
aVAbout 20 years ago,
p73
aVI was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict,
p74
aVand I had an extra month,
p75
aVso I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen.
p76
aVI was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict.
p77
aVBecause, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers,
p78
aVliving pretty much like our ancestors lived
p79
aVfor maybe 99 percent of the human story.
p80
aVAnd all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting \u2014
p81
aVabsolutely fatal.
p82
aVSo how do they deal with their differences?
p83
aVWell, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities,
p84
aVsomeone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush,
p85
aVand then everyone sits around in a circle like this,
p86
aVand they sit and they talk and they talk.
p87
aVIt may take two days, three days, four days,
p88
aVbut they don't rest until they find a resolution
p89
aVor better yet \u2014 a reconciliation.
p90
aVAnd if tempers are still too high,
p91
aVthen they send someone off to visit some relatives,
p92
aVas a cooling-off period.
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, that system is, I think, probably the system
p95
aVthat kept us alive to this point,
p96
aVgiven our human tendencies.
p97
aVThat system, I call "the third side."
p98
aVBecause if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict,
p99
aVwhen we describe it,
p100
aVthere's always two sides \u2014
p101
aVit's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management,
p102
aVhusband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats.
p103
aVBut what we don't often see
p104
aVis that there's always a third side,
p105
aVand the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community,
p106
aVit's the friends, the allies,
p107
aVthe family members, the neighbors.
p108
aVAnd we can play an incredibly constructive role.
p109
aa(lp110
VPerhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help
p111
aVis to remind the parties of what's really at stake.
p112
aVFor the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family,
p113
aVfor the sake of the community, for the sake of the future,
p114
aVlet's stop fighting for a moment and start talking.
p115
aVBecause, the thing is,
p116
aVwhen we're involved in conflict,
p117
aVit's very easy to lose perspective.
p118
aVIt's very easy to react.
p119
aVHuman beings \u2014 we're reaction machines.
p120
aVAnd as the saying goes,
p121
aVwhen angry, you will make the best speech
p122
aVyou will ever regret.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd so the third side reminds us of that.
p127
aVThe third side helps us go to the balcony,
p128
aVwhich is a metaphor for a place of perspective,
p129
aVwhere we can keep our eyes on the prize.
p130
aa(lp131
VLet me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience.
p132
aVSome years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks
p133
aVbetween the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya.
p134
aVThere was a war going on, as you know.
p135
aVAnd we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace,
p136
aVin the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place.
p137
aVAnd the talks got off to a rather rocky start
p138
aVwhen the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians
p139
aVand said, "You should stay right here in your seats,
p140
aVbecause you're going to be on trial for war crimes."
p141
aVAnd then he turned to me and said,
p142
aV"You're an American.
p143
aVLook at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico."
p144
aVAnd my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?"
p145
aVI started reacting.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VBut then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony.
p150
aVAnd then when he paused
p151
aVand everyone looked at me for a response,
p152
aVfrom a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks
p153
aVand say, "I appreciate your criticism of my country
p154
aVand I take it as a sign that we're among friends
p155
aVand can speak candidly to one another."
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
V"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.
p160
aVWe're here to see if we can figure out a way
p161
aVto stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya."
p162
aVThe conversation got back on track.
p163
aVThat's the role of the third side,
p164
aVto help the parties go to the balcony.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow let me take you, for a moment,
p167
aVto what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict,
p168
aVor the most impossible conflict, the Middle East.
p169
aVQuestion is: where's the third side there?
p170
aVHow could we possibly go to the balcony?
p171
aVNow, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict,
p172
aVbut I think I've got a first step \u2014 literally, a first step \u2014
p173
aVsomething that any one of us could do as third-siders.
p174
aVLet me just ask you one question first.
p175
aVHow many of you in the last years
p176
aVhave ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East
p177
aVand wondering what anyone could do?
p178
aVJust out of curiosity, how many of you?
p179
aVOK, so the great majority of us.
p180
aVAnd here, it's so far away.
p181
aVWhy do we pay so much attention to this conflict?
p182
aVIs it the number of deaths?
p183
aVThere are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa
p184
aVthan in the Middle East.
p185
aVNo, it's because of the story,
p186
aVbecause we feel personally involved in that story.
p187
aVWhether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious,
p188
aVwe feel we have a personal stake in it.
p189
aa(lp190
VStories matter;
p191
aVas an anthropologist, I know that.
p192
aVStories are what we use to transmit knowledge.
p193
aVThey give meaning to our lives.
p194
aVThat's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories.
p195
aVStories are the key.
p196
aVAnd so my question is \u2014
p197
aVyes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East,
p198
aVbut let's also take a look at the story.
p199
aVLet's try to get at the root of what it's all about.
p200
aVLet's see if we can apply the third side to it.
p201
aVWhat would that mean? What is the story there?
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story.
p204
aVWhat's the origin story of the Middle East?
p205
aVIn a phrase, it's:
p206
aVFour thousand years ago,
p207
aVa man and his family walked across the Middle East,
p208
aVand the world has never been the same since.
p209
aVThat man, of course, was Abraham.
p210
aVAnd what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family;
p211
aVhe's the father of us all.
p212
aVBut it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was.
p213
aVHis basic message was unity too,
p214
aVthe interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all.
p215
aVAnd his basic value was respect,
p216
aVwas kindness toward strangers.
p217
aVThat's what he's known for, his hospitality.
p218
aVSo in that sense,
p219
aVhe's the symbolic third side of the Middle East.
p220
aVHe's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole.
p221
aVNow, think about that for a moment.
p222
aa(lp223
VToday, we face the scourge of terrorism.
p224
aVWhat is terrorism?
p225
aVTerrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger
p226
aVand treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear.
p227
aVWhat's the opposite of terrorism?
p228
aVIt's taking an innocent stranger
p229
aVand treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home,
p230
aVin order to sow and create understanding
p231
aVor respect, or love.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo what if, then, you took the story of Abraham,
p234
aVwhich is a third-side story,
p235
aVwhat if that could be \u2014
p236
aVbecause Abraham stands for hospitality \u2014
p237
aVwhat if that could be an antidote to terrorism?
p238
aVWhat if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance?
p239
aVHow would you bring that story to life?
p240
aVNow, it's not enough just to tell a story.
p241
aVThat's powerful, but people need to experience the story.
p242
aVThey need to be able to live the story.
p243
aVHow would you do that?
p244
aVAnd that was my thinking of how would you do that.
p245
aVAnd that's what comes to the first step here.
p246
aVBecause the simple way to do that is:
p247
aVyou go for a walk.
p248
aVYou go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham.
p249
aVYou retrace the footsteps of Abraham.
p250
aVBecause walking has a real power.
p251
aVYou know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human.
p252
aVIt's funny \u2014 when you walk, you walk side-by-side,
p253
aVin the same common direction.
p254
aVNow if I were to come to you face-to-face
p255
aVand come this close to you,
p256
aVyou would feel threatened.
p257
aVBut if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,
p258
aVeven touching shoulders,
p259
aVit's no problem.
p260
aVWho fights while they walk?
p261
aVThat's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough,
p262
aVpeople go for walks in the woods.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path,
p265
aVa route \u2014 think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail \u2014
p266
aVthat followed in the footsteps of Abraham?
p267
aVPeople said, "That's crazy. You can't.
p268
aVYou can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham \u2014 it's too insecure,
p269
aVyou've got to cross all these borders,
p270
aVit goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East,
p271
aVbecause it unites them all."
p272
aVAnd so we studied the idea at Harvard.
p273
aVWe did our due diligence.
p274
aVAnd then a few years ago,
p275
aVa group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries,
p276
aVdecided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham,
p277
aVgoing from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa
p278
aVin Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.
p279
aVAnd we then took a bus and took some walks
p280
aVand went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey.
p281
aVThen we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo,
p282
aVwhich, turns out, is named after Abraham.
p283
aVWe went to Damascus,
p284
aVwhich has a long history associated with Abraham.
p285
aVWe then came to Northern Jordan,
p286
aVto Jerusalem \u2014 which is all about Abraham \u2014 to Bethlehem,
p287
aVand finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron.
p288
aVSo effectively, we went from womb to tomb.
p289
aVWe showed it could be done.
p290
aVIt was an amazing journey.
p291
aa(lp292
VLet me ask you a question.
p293
aVHow many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood
p294
aVor strange land,
p295
aVand a total stranger, perfect stranger,
p296
aVcomes up to you and shows you some kindness \u2014
p297
aVmaybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink,
p298
aVgives you a coffee, gives you a meal?
p299
aVHow many of you have ever had that experience?
p300
aVThat's the essence of the Abraham Path.
p301
aVThat's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East
p302
aVwhere you expect hostility,
p303
aVand you get the most amazing hospitality,
p304
aVall associated with Abraham:
p305
aV"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food."
p306
aVSo what we discovered
p307
aVis that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people;
p308
aVhe's alive, he's a living presence.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd to make a long story short,
p311
aVin the last couple of years now,
p312
aVthousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham
p313
aVin the Middle East,
p314
aVenjoying the hospitality of the people there.
p315
aVThey've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine,
p316
aVin Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.
p317
aVIt's an amazing experience.
p318
aVMen, women, young people, old people \u2014
p319
aVmore women than men, actually, interestingly.
p320
aa(lp321
VFor those who can't walk,
p322
aVwho are unable to get there right now,
p323
aVpeople started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities.
p324
aVIn Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk
p325
aVfrom a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together.
p326
aVIt was Abraham Path Day.
p327
aVIn São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event
p328
aVfor thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run,
p329
aVuniting the different communities.
p330
aVThe media love it; they really adore it.
p331
aVThey lavish attention on it because it's visual
p332
aVand it spreads the idea,
p333
aVthis idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers.
p334
aVAnd just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it.
p335
aVLast month,
p336
aVthere was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it,
p337
aVtwo whole pages.
p338
aVAnd they quoted a villager
p339
aVwho said, "This walk connects us to the world."
p340
aVHe said, "It was like a light that went on in our lives \u2014
p341
aVit brought us hope."
p342
aVAnd so that's what it's about.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut it's not just about psychology;
p345
aVit's about economics.
p346
aVBecause as people walk, they spend money.
p347
aVAnd this woman right here, Um Ahmad,
p348
aVis a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan.
p349
aVShe's desperately poor.
p350
aVShe's partially blind, her husband can't work,
p351
aVshe's got seven kids.
p352
aVBut what she can do is cook.
p353
aVAnd so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers
p354
aVwho come through the village and have a meal in her home.
p355
aVThey sit on the floor \u2014 she doesn't even have a tablecloth.
p356
aVShe makes the most delicious food,
p357
aVthat's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.
p358
aVAnd so more and more walkers have come,
p359
aVand lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family.
p360
aVAnd so she told our team there, she said,
p361
aV"You have made me visible
p362
aVin a village where people were once ashamed to look at me."
p363
aVThat's the potential of the Abraham Path.
p364
aa(lp365
VThere are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities
p366
aVacross the Middle East, across the path.
p367
aVThe potential is basically to change the game.
p368
aVAnd to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things \u2014
p369
aVto change the frame from hostility to hospitality,
p370
aVfrom terrorism to tourism.
p371
aVAnd in that sense, the Abraham Path
p372
aVis a game-changer.
p373
aa(lp374
VLet me just show you one thing.
p375
aVI have a little acorn here
p376
aVthat I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year.
p377
aVNow, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course \u2014
p378
aVgrows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.
p379
aVThe path right now is like an acorn;
p380
aVit's still in its early phase.
p381
aVWhat would the oak tree look like?
p382
aVWhen I think back to my childhood,
p383
aVa good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago,
p384
aVI spent in Europe.
p385
aVIf you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin,
p386
aVand you had said,
p387
aV"Sixty years from now,
p388
aVthis is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,"
p389
aVpeople would have thought you were certifiably insane.
p390
aVBut they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe,
p391
aVand a common economy.
p392
aVSo my question is, if it can be done in Europe,
p393
aVwhy not in the Middle East?
p394
aVWhy not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham,
p395
aVand thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?
p396
aa(lp397
VSo let me conclude, then,
p398
aVby saying that in the last 35 years,
p399
aVas I've worked in some of the most dangerous,
p400
aVdifficult and intractable conflicts around the planet,
p401
aVI have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed.
p402
aVIt's not easy, of course.
p403
aVBut it's possible.
p404
aVIt was done in South Africa.
p405
aVIt was done in Northern Ireland.
p406
aVIt could be done anywhere.
p407
aVIt simply depends on us.
p408
aVIt depends on us taking the third side.
p409
aVSo let me invite you to consider taking the third side,
p410
aVeven as a very small step.
p411
aVWe're about to take a break in a moment.
p412
aVJust go up to someone
p413
aVwho's from a different culture, a different country,
p414
aVa different ethnicity \u2014 some difference \u2014
p415
aVand engage them in a conversation.
p416
aVListen to them.
p417
aVThat's a third-side act.
p418
aVThat's walking Abraham's Path.
p419
aVAfter a TED Talk,
p420
aVwhy not a TED Walk?
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VSo let me just leave you with three things.
p425
aVOne is, the secret to peace is the third side.
p426
aVThe third side is us.
p427
aVEach of us, with a single step,
p428
aVcan take the world, can bring the world
p429
aVa step closer to peace.
p430
aVThere's an old African proverb that goes:
