VSo what does it mean for a machine to be athletic?
p4
aVWe will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism
p5
aVand the research to achieve it
p6
aVwith the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters,
p7
aVor quads, for short.
p8
aa(lp9
VQuads have been around for a long time.
p10
aVThey're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple.
p11
aVBy controlling the speeds of these four propellers,
p12
aVthese machines can roll, pitch, yaw,
p13
aVand accelerate along their common orientation.
p14
aVOn board are also a battery, a computer,
p15
aVvarious sensors and wireless radios.
p16
aa(lp17
VQuads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost.
p18
aVThey are inherently unstable,
p19
aVand they need some form of automatic feedback control
p20
aVin order to be able to fly.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, how did it just do that?
p23
aVCameras on the ceiling and a laptop
p24
aVserve as an indoor global positioning system.
p25
aVIt's used to locate objects in the space
p26
aVthat have these reflective markers on them.
p27
aVThis data is then sent to another laptop
p28
aVthat is running estimation and control algorithms,
p29
aVwhich in turn sends commands to the quad,
p30
aVwhich is also running estimation and control algorithms.
p31
aVThe bulk of our research is algorithms.
p32
aVIt's the magic that brings these machines to life.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete?
p35
aVWe use something broadly called model-based design.
p36
aVWe first capture the physics
p37
aVwith a mathematical model of how the machines behave.
p38
aVWe then use a branch of mathematics called control theory
p39
aVto analyze these models
p40
aVand also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them.
p41
aVFor example, that's how we can make the quad hover.
p42
aVWe first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations.
p43
aVWe then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory
p44
aVto create algorithms that stabilize the quad.
p45
aa(lp46
VLet me demonstrate the strength of this approach.
p47
aVSuppose that we want this quad to not only hover
p48
aVbut to also balance this pole.
p49
aVWith a little bit of practice,
p50
aVit's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this,
p51
aValthough we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground
p52
aVand the use of our very versatile hands.
p53
aVIt becomes a little bit more difficult
p54
aVwhen I only have one foot on the ground
p55
aVand when I don't use my hands.
p56
aVNotice how this pole has a reflective marker on top,
p57
aVwhich means that it can be located in the space.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Audience) Oh!
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause ends)
p64
aa(lp65
VYou can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments
p66
aVto keep the pole balanced.
p67
aVHow did we design the algorithms to do this?
p68
aVWe added the mathematical model of the pole
p69
aVto that of the quad.
p70
aVOnce we have a model of the combined quad-pole system,
p71
aVwe can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.
p72
aVHere, you see that it's stable,
p73
aVand even if I give it little nudges,
p74
aVit goes back \u2014
p75
aVto the nice, balanced position.
p76
aa(lp77
VWe can also augment the model
p78
aVto include where we want the quad to be in space.
p79
aVUsing this pointer, made out of reflective markers,
p80
aVI can point to where I want the quad to be in space
p81
aVa fixed distance away from me.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VThe key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms,
p86
aVdesigned with the help of mathematical models
p87
aVand control theory.
p88
aa(lp89
VLet's tell the quad to come back here
p90
aVand let the pole drop,
p91
aVand I will next demonstrate the importance
p92
aVof understanding physical models
p93
aVand the workings of the physical world.
p94
aVNotice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it.
p95
aVUnlike the balancing pole,
p96
aVI did not include the mathematical model of the glass
p97
aVin the system.
p98
aVIn fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there.
p99
aVLike before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad
p100
aVwhere I want it to be in space.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
V(Applause ends)
p105
aa(lp106
VOkay, you should be asking yourself,
p107
aVwhy doesn't the water fall out of the glass?
p108
aVTwo facts.
p109
aVThe first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way.
p110
aVThe second is that the propellers
p111
aVare all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up.
p112
aVYou put these two things together,
p113
aVthe net result is that all side forces on the glass are small
p114
aVand are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects,
p115
aVwhich at these speeds are negligible.
p116
aVAnd that's why you don't need to model the glass.
p117
aVIt naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Audience) Oh!
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause ends)
p124
aa(lp125
VThe lesson here
p126
aVis that some high-performance tasks are easier than others,
p127
aVand that understanding the physics of the problem
p128
aVtells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard.
p129
aVIn this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy.
p130
aVBalancing a pole is hard.
p131
aa(lp132
VWe've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured.
p133
aVCan a machine also perform with extreme physical damage?
p134
aVConventional wisdom says
p135
aVthat you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly,
p136
aVbecause there are four degrees of freedom to control:
p137
aVroll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.
p138
aVHexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers,
p139
aVcan provide redundancy,
p140
aVbut quadrocopters are much more popular
p141
aVbecause they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.
p142
aVOr do they?
p143
aa(lp144
V(Audience) Oh!
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VIf we analyze the mathematical model of this machine
p149
aVwith only two working propellers,
p150
aVwe discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.
p151
aVWe relinquish control of yaw,
p152
aVbut roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled
p153
aVwith algorithms that exploit this new configuration.
p154
aVMathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.
p155
aVIn this instance, this knowledge allows us to design
p156
aVnovel machine architectures
p157
aVor to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage,
p158
aVjust like human athletes do,
p159
aVinstead of building machines with redundancy.
p160
aa(lp161
VWe can't help but hold our breath
p162
aVwhen we watch a diver somersaulting into the water,
p163
aVor when a vaulter is twisting in the air,
p164
aVthe ground fast approaching.
p165
aVWill the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?
p166
aVWill the vaulter stick the landing?
p167
aVSuppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip
p168
aVand finish off at the exact same spot that it started.
p169
aVThis maneuver is going to happen so quickly
p170
aVthat we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.
p171
aVThere simply isn't enough time.
p172
aVInstead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly,
p173
aVobserve how it finishes the maneuver,
p174
aVand then use that information to modify its behavior
p175
aVso that the next flip is better.
p176
aVSimilar to the diver and the vaulter,
p177
aVit is only through repeated practice
p178
aVthat the maneuver can be learned and executed
p179
aVto the highest standard.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VStriking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.
p186
aVHow do we make a machine do
p187
aVwhat an athlete does seemingly without effort?
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause ends)
p194
aa(lp195
VThis quad has a racket strapped onto its head
p196
aVwith a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.
p197
aVThe following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds,
p198
aVor 50 times per second.
p199
aVWe first figure out where the ball is going.
p200
aVWe then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball
p201
aVso that it flies to where it was thrown from.
p202
aVThird, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad
p203
aVfrom its current state to the impact point with the ball.
p204
aVFourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.
p205
aVTwenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated
p206
aVuntil the quad strikes the ball.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VMachines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own,
p211
aVthey can do it collectively.
p212
aVThese three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
V(Applause ends)
p217
aa(lp218
VThey perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver
p219
aVto launch the ball back to me.
p220
aVNotice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VIn fact, when fully extended,
p225
aVthis is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels
p226
aVat the end of their launch.
p227
aa(lp228
VThe algorithms to do this are very similar
p229
aVto what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.
p230
aVMathematical models are used to continuously re-plan
p231
aVa cooperative strategy 50 times per second.
p232
aa(lp233
VEverything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities.
p234
aVWhat happens when we couple this machine athleticism
p235
aVwith that of a human being?
p236
aVWhat I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor
p237
aVmainly used in gaming.
p238
aVIt can recognize what my various body parts
p239
aVare doing in real time.
p240
aVSimilar to the pointer that I used earlier,
p241
aVwe can use this as inputs to the system.
p242
aVWe now have a natural way of interacting
p243
aVwith the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VInteraction doesn't have to be virtual.
p248
aVIt can be physical.
p249
aVTake this quad, for example.
p250
aVIt's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
p251
aVIf I try to move it out of the way, it fights me,
p252
aVand moves back to where it wants to be.
p253
aVWe can change this behavior, however.
p254
aVWe can use mathematical models
p255
aVto estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.
p256
aVOnce we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics,
p257
aVas far as the quad is concerned, of course.
p258
aVHere, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine.
p261
aVI will use this new capability to position
p262
aVthis camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location
p263
aVfor filming the remainder of this demonstration.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo we can physically interact with these quads
p266
aVand we can change the laws of physics.
p267
aVLet's have a little bit of fun with this.
p268
aVFor what you will see next,
p269
aVthese quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto.
p270
aVAs time goes on, gravity will be increased
p271
aVuntil we're all back on planet Earth,
p272
aVbut I assure you we won't get there.
p273
aVOkay, here goes.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VWhew!
p282
aVYou're all thinking now,
p283
aVthese guys are having way too much fun,
p284
aVand you're probably also asking yourself,
p285
aVwhy exactly are they building machine athletes?
p286
aVSome conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom
p287
aVis to hone skills and develop capabilities.
p288
aVOthers think that it has more of a social role,
p289
aVthat it's used to bind the group.
p290
aVSimilarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism
p291
aVto create new algorithms for machines
p292
aVto push them to their limits.
p293
aVWhat impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life?
p294
aVLike all our past creations and innovations,
p295
aVthey may be used to improve the human condition
p296
aVor they may be misused and abused.
p297
aVThis is not a technical choice we are faced with;
p298
aVit's a social one.
p299
aVLet's make the right choice,
p300
aVthe choice that brings out the best in the future of machines,
p301
aVjust like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us.
p302
