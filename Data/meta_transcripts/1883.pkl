VSo when I do my job, people hate me.
p4
aVIn fact, the better I do my job,
p5
aVthe more people hate me.
p6
aVAnd no, I'm not a meter maid,
p7
aVand I'm not an undertaker.
p8
aVI am a progressive, lesbian talking head on Fox News.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Applause)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right?
p13
aVI am a gay talking head on Fox News.
p14
aVI am going to tell you how I do it,
p15
aVand the most important thing I've learned.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I go on television.
p18
aVI debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in \u2014
p19
aVin some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.
p20
aVIt's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle
p21
aVon steroids,
p22
aVwith a live television audience of millions.
p23
aVIt's totally almost just like that.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd that's just on air.
p26
aVThe hate mail I get is unbelievable.
p27
aVLast week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email
p28
aVand more hate tweets than I can even count.
p29
aVI was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge,
p30
aVa cunt and an ugly man,
p31
aVand that was just in one email.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo what have I realized,
p36
aVbeing on the receiving end of all this ugliness?
p37
aVWell, my biggest takeaway
p38
aVis that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness,
p39
aVbut what matters more is emotional correctness.
p40
aVLet me give you a small example.
p41
aVI don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't.
p42
aVI care about two things.
p43
aVOne, I care that you spell it right.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p46
aa(lp47
VJust quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
p48
aVYou'd totally be surprised.
p49
aVAnd second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
p50
aVAre you being friendly? Are you just being naive?
p51
aVOr do you really want to hurt me personally?
p52
aa(lp53
VEmotional correctness is the tone, the feeling,
p54
aVhow we say what we say,
p55
aVthe respect and compassion we show one another.
p56
aVAnd what I've realized is that political persuasion
p57
aVdoesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
p58
aVPolitical persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo when I first went to go work at Fox News,
p61
aVtrue confession,
p62
aVI expected there to be marks in the carpet
p63
aVfrom all the knuckle-dragging.
p64
aVThat, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.
p65
aVBut liberals on my side,
p66
aVwe can be self-righteous, we can be condescending,
p67
aVwe can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us.
p68
aVIn other words, we can be politically right
p69
aVbut emotionally wrong.
p70
aVAnd incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?
p71
aa(lp72
VNow here's the kicker.
p73
aVConservatives are really nice.
p74
aVI mean, not all of them,
p75
aVand not the ones who send me hate mail,
p76
aVbut you would be surprised.
p77
aVSean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.
p78
aVHe spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,
p79
aVand I know that if I ever had a problem,
p80
aVhe would do anything he could to help.
p81
aVNow, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong,
p82
aVbut his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive.
p83
aVAnd that's why people listen to him.
p84
aVBecause you can't get anyone to agree with you
p85
aVif they don't even listen to you first.
p86
aVWe spend so much time talking past each other
p87
aVand not enough time talking through our disagreements.
p88
aVAnd if we can start to find compassion for one another,
p89
aVthen we have a shot at building common ground.
p90
aVIt actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here,
p91
aVbut when you try to put it in practice,
p92
aVit's really powerful.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo someone who says they hate immigrants,
p95
aVI try to imagine how scared they must be
p96
aVthat their community is changing from what they've always known.
p97
aVOr someone who says they don't like teachers' unions,
p98
aVI bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter,
p99
aVand they're just looking for someone to blame.
p100
aVOur challenge is to find the compassion for others
p101
aVthat we want them to have for us.
p102
aVThat is emotional correctness.
p103
aa(lp104
VI'm not saying it's easy.
p105
aVAn average of, like, 5.6 times per day
p106
aVI have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail
p107
aVwith a flurry of vile profanities.
p108
aVThis whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing
p109
aVis kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me,
p110
aVand I ain't the Dalai Lama.
p111
aVI'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic.
p112
aVBecause I don't just get hate mail.
p113
aVI get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.
p114
aVAnd one of my all-time favorites begins:
p115
aV"I am not a big fan of your political leanings
p116
aVor your sometimes tortured logic,
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
Vbut I'm a big fan of you as a person."
p121
aVNow this guy doesn't agree with me \u2014 yet.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut he's listening \u2014
p126
aVnot because of what I said, but because of how I said it.
p127
aVAnd somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.
p128
aVThat's emotional correctness,
p129
aVand that's how we start the conversations
p130
aVthat really lead to change.
p131
aa(lp132
VThank you.
