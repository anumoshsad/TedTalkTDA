VRoy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about,
p4
aVeven though he may have been responsible
p5
aVfor 22 somewhat mediocre  minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
p6
aVHe may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes,
p7
aVbut not very many of you.
p8
aVAnd all of that goes back to a decision
p9
aVthat Roy had to make about three years ago.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.
p12
aVThat's the TV production company of Amazon.
p13
aVHe's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,
p14
aVdescribes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."
p15
aVAnd Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility
p16
aVto pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make.
p17
aVAnd of course that's a highly competitive space.
p18
aVI mean, there are so many TV shows already out there,
p19
aVthat Roy can't just choose any show.
p20
aVHe has to find shows that are really, really great.
p21
aVSo in other words, he has to find shows
p22
aVthat are on the very right end of this curve here.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo this curve here is the rating distribution
p25
aVof about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB,
p26
aVand the rating goes from one to 10,
p27
aVand the height here shows you how many shows get that rating.
p28
aVSo if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner.
p29
aVThen you have a top two percent show.
p30
aVThat's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire,"
p31
aVso all of these shows that are addictive,
p32
aVwhereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like,
p33
aV"Where can I get more of these episodes?"
p34
aVThat kind of show.
p35
aVOn the left side, just for clarity, here on that end,
p36
aVyou have a show called "Toddlers and Tiaras" \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V\u2014 which should tell you enough
p41
aVabout what's going on on that end of the curve.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve,
p44
aVbecause I think you would have to have some serious brainpower
p45
aVto undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."
p46
aVSo what he's worried about is this middle bulge here,
p47
aVthe bulge of average TV,
p48
aVyou know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad,
p49
aVthey don't really get you excited.
p50
aVSo he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo the pressure is on,
p53
aVand of course it's also the first time
p54
aVthat Amazon is even doing something like this,
p55
aVso Roy Price does not want to take any chances.
p56
aVHe wants to engineer success.
p57
aVHe needs a guaranteed success,
p58
aVand so what he does is, he holds a competition.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,
p61
aVand from those ideas, through an evaluation,
p62
aVthey select eight candidates for TV shows,
p63
aVand then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows
p64
aVand puts them online for free for everyone to watch.
p65
aVAnd so when Amazon is giving out free stuff,
p66
aVyou're going to take it, right?
p67
aVSo millions of viewers are watching those episodes.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows,
p70
aVactually, they are being watched.
p71
aVThey are being watched by Roy Price and his team,
p72
aVwho record everything.
p73
aVThey record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause,
p74
aVwhat parts they skip, what parts they watch again.
p75
aVSo they collect millions of data points,
p76
aVbecause they want to have those data points
p77
aVto then decide which show they should make.
p78
aVAnd sure enough, so they collect all the data,
p79
aVthey do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges,
p80
aVand the answer is,
p81
aV"Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators."
p82
aVThey did that show.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo does anyone know the name of the show?
p85
aV(Audience: "Alpha House.")
p86
aVYes, "Alpha House,"
p87
aVbut it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually,
p88
aVbecause it didn't turn out that great.
p89
aVIt's actually just an average show,
p90
aVactually \u2014 literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7.4,
p91
aVand "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,
p92
aVso a slightly above average show,
p93
aVbut certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for.
p94
aVMeanwhile, however, at about the same time,
p95
aVat another company,
p96
aVanother executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis,
p97
aVand his name is Ted,
p98
aVTed Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,
p99
aVand just like Roy, he's on a constant mission
p100
aVto find that great TV show,
p101
aVand he uses data as well to do that,
p102
aVexcept he does it a little bit differently.
p103
aVSo instead of holding a competition, what he did \u2014 and his team of course \u2014
p104
aVwas they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers,
p105
aVyou know, the ratings they give their shows,
p106
aVthe viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on.
p107
aVAnd then they use that data to discover
p108
aVall of these little bits and pieces about the audience:
p109
aVwhat kinds of shows they like,
p110
aVwhat kind of producers, what kind of actors.
p111
aVAnd once they had all of these pieces together,
p112
aVthey took a leap of faith,
p113
aVand they decided to license
p114
aVnot a sitcom about four Senators
p115
aVbut a drama series about a single Senator.
p116
aVYou guys know the show?
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VYes, "House of Cards," and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show,
p121
aVat least for the first two seasons.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p124
aa(lp125
V"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve,
p126
aVso it's exactly where they wanted it to be.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, the question of course is, what happened here?
p129
aVSo you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
p130
aVThey connect all of these millions of data points,
p131
aVand then it works beautifully for one of them,
p132
aVand it doesn't work for the other one.
p133
aVSo why?
p134
aVBecause logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time.
p135
aVI mean, if you're collecting millions of data points
p136
aVon a decision you're going to make,
p137
aVthen you should be able to make a pretty good decision.
p138
aVYou have 200 years of statistics to rely on.
p139
aVYou're amplifying it with very powerful computers.
p140
aVThe least you could expect is good TV, right?
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd if data analysis does not work that way,
p143
aVthen it actually gets a little scary,
p144
aVbecause we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more
p145
aVto make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV.
p146
aVDoes anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
p147
aVNo one. OK, that's good actually.
p148
aVOK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company,
p149
aVand I hope that nobody here in this room
p150
aVever comes into contact with that software,
p151
aVbecause if you do, it means you're in prison.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VIf someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole,
p156
aVthen it's very likely that data analysis software from that company
p157
aVwill be used in determining whether to grant that parole.
p158
aVSo it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix,
p159
aVbut now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad,
p160
aVyou're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad.
p161
aVAnd mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad,
p162
aVbut more years in prison, I guess, even worse.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis,
p165
aVdespite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results.
p166
aVAnd that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems
p167
aVdoesn't know what to do with data.
p168
aVEven the most data-savvy companies get it wrong.
p169
aVYes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.
p170
aa(lp171
VIn 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis,
p172
aVto predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu,
p173
aVby doing data analysis on their Google searches.
p174
aVAnd it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news,
p175
aVincluding the pinnacle of scientific success:
p176
aVa publication in the journal "Nature."
p177
aVIt worked beautifully for year after year after year,
p178
aVuntil one year it failed.
p179
aVAnd nobody could even tell exactly why.
p180
aVIt just didn't work that year,
p181
aVand of course that again made big news,
p182
aVincluding now a retraction
p183
aVof a publication from the journal "Nature."
p184
aVSo even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google,
p185
aVthey sometimes get it wrong.
p186
aVAnd despite all those failures,
p187
aVdata is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making \u2014
p188
aVinto the workplace,
p189
aVlaw enforcement,
p190
aVmedicine.
p191
aVSo we should better make sure that data is helping.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself,
p194
aVbecause I work in computational genetics,
p195
aVwhich is also a field where lots of very smart people
p196
aVare using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions
p197
aVlike deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug.
p198
aVAnd over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern
p199
aVor kind of rule, if you will, about the difference
p200
aVbetween successful decision-making with data
p201
aVand unsuccessful decision-making,
p202
aVand I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo whenever you're solving a complex problem,
p205
aVyou're doing essentially two things.
p206
aVThe first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces
p207
aVso that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces,
p208
aVand then of course you do the second part.
p209
aVYou put all of these bits and pieces back together again
p210
aVto come to your conclusion.
p211
aVAnd sometimes you have to do it over again,
p212
aVbut it's always those two things:
p213
aVtaking apart and putting back together again.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd now the crucial thing is
p216
aVthat data and data analysis
p217
aVis only good for the first part.
p218
aVData and data analysis, no matter how powerful,
p219
aVcan only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces.
p220
aVIt's not suited to put those pieces back together again
p221
aVand then to come to a conclusion.
p222
aVThere's another tool that can do that, and we all have it,
p223
aVand that tool is the brain.
p224
aVIf there's one thing a brain is good at,
p225
aVit's taking bits and pieces back together again,
p226
aVeven when you have incomplete information,
p227
aVand coming to a good conclusion,
p228
aVespecially if it's the brain of an expert.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful,
p231
aVbecause they used data and brains where they belong in the process.
p232
aVThey use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience
p233
aVthat they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth,
p234
aVbut then the decision to take all these bits and pieces
p235
aVand put them back together again and make a show like "House of Cards,"
p236
aVthat was nowhere in the data.
p237
aVTed Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show,
p238
aVwhich also meant, by the way, that they were taking
p239
aVa pretty big personal risk with that decision.
p240
aVAnd Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around.
p241
aVThey used data all the way to drive their decision-making,
p242
aVfirst when they held their competition of TV ideas,
p243
aVthen when they selected "Alpha House" to make as a show.
p244
aVWhich of course was a very safe decision for them,
p245
aVbecause they could always point at the data, saying,
p246
aV"This is what the data tells us."
p247
aVBut it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions,
p250
aVbut I believe that things go wrong
p251
aVwhen data is starting to drive those decisions.
p252
aVNo matter how powerful, data is just a tool,
p253
aVand to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful.
p254
aVMany of you will ...
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VBefore there was data,
p259
aVthis was the decision-making device to use.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VMany of you will know this.
p264
aVThis toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,
p265
aVand it's really amazing,
p266
aVbecause if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question,
p267
aVall you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer \u2014
p268
aV"Most Likely" \u2014 right here in this window in real time.
p269
aVI'll have it out later for tech demos.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, the thing is, of course \u2014 so I've made some decisions in my life
p274
aVwhere, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball.
p275
aVBut, you know, of course, if you have the data available,
p276
aVyou want to replace this with something much more sophisticated,
p277
aVlike data analysis to come to a better decision.
p278
aVBut that does not change the basic setup.
p279
aVSo the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter,
p280
aVbut I believe it's still on us to make the decisions
p281
aVif we want to achieve something extraordinary,
p282
aVon the right end of the curve.
p283
aVAnd I find that a very encouraging message, in fact,
p284
aVthat even in the face of huge amounts of data,
p285
aVit still pays off to make decisions,
p286
aVto be an expert in what you're doing
p287
aVand take risks.
p288
aVBecause in the end, it's not data,
p289
aVit's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve.
