VI think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.
p4
aVEvery man deserves the opportunity
p5
aVto grow a little bit of luxury.
p6
aa(lp7
VLadies and gentlemen, and more importantly,
p8
aVMo Bros and Mo Sistas \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p9
aVfor the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you
p10
aVmy Movember journey, and how, through that journey,
p11
aVwe've redefined charity, we're redefining the way
p12
aVprostate cancer researchers are working together
p13
aVthroughout the world, and I hope, through that process,
p14
aVthat I inspire you to create something significant
p15
aVin your life, something significant that will go on
p16
aVand make this world a better place.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo the most common question I get asked,
p19
aVand I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it
p20
aVover drinks tonight, is how did this come about?
p21
aVHow did Movember start?
p22
aVWell, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone
p23
aVthat is directly affected by a cause.
p24
aVThey then go on to create an event, and beyond that,
p25
aVa foundation to support that.
p26
aVPretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.
p27
aVNot so with Movember. Movember started in a very
p28
aVtraditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.
p29
aVI was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,
p30
aVand I was watching the world go by,
p31
aVhad a few more beers, and the conversation turned
p32
aVto '70s fashion \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p33
aVand how everything manages to come back into style.
p34
aVAnd a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff
p35
aVthat hasn't come back." (Laughter)
p36
aVThen one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?
p37
aVWhy hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter)
p38
aVSo then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended
p39
aVwith a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache,
p42
aVso we renamed the month of November "Movember"
p43
aVand created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.
p44
aVAnd they are: start the month clean-shaven,
p45
aVrock a mustache \u2014 not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache \u2014
p46
aVfor the 30 days of November, and then we agreed
p47
aVthat we would come together at the end of the month,
p48
aVhave a mustache-themed party, and award a prize
p49
aVfor the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VNow trust me, when you're growing a mustache
p52
aVback in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,
p53
aVand this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement
p54
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p55
aVit created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)
p56
aVSo my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.
p57
aVMy girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 hated it.
p58
aVParents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)
p59
aVBut we came together at the end of the month and
p60
aVwe celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.
p61
aVAnd we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,
p62
aV"That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this
p63
aVso we can get away with it year on year." (Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo we started thinking about that, and we were inspired
p66
aVby the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.
p67
aVAnd we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.
p68
aVWhy is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache
p69
aVand doing something for men's health?
p70
aVAnd I started to research that topic, and discovered
p71
aVprostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer
p72
aVin terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut there was nothing for this cause,
p75
aVso we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,
p76
aVand then we created our tagline, which is,
p77
aV"Changing the face of men's health."
p78
aVAnd that eloquently describes the challenge,
p79
aVchanging your appearance for the 30 days,
p80
aVand also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:
p81
aVgetting men engaged in their health, having them have
p82
aVa better understanding about the health risks that they face.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo with that model, I then
p85
aVcold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
p86
aVI said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea
p87
aVthat's going to transform your organization." (Laughter)
p88
aVAnd I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,
p89
aVso I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne
p90
aVin 2004.
p91
aVAnd we sat down, and I shared with him my vision
p92
aVof getting men growing mustaches across Australia,
p93
aVraising awareness for this cause,
p94
aVand funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership
p95
aVto legitimately do that.
p96
aVAnd I said, "We're going to come together at the end,
p97
aVwe're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,
p98
aVwe're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health."
p99
aVAnd he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,
p100
aVhe said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea,
p101
aVbut we're an ultraconservative organization.
p102
aVWe can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter)
p103
aVSo I paid for coffee that day \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p104
aVand his parting comment as we shook hands was,
p105
aV"Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,
p106
aVwe'll gladly take it." (Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo my lesson that year was persistence.
p109
aVAnd we persisted, and we got 450 guys
p110
aVgrowing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,
p111
aVand we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,
p112
aVand that represented at the time the single biggest donation
p113
aVthey'd ever received.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.
p116
aVEvery day \u2014 this morning, I wake up and go, my life
p117
aVis about a mustache. (Laughter)
p118
aVEssentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter)
p119
aVAnd my season is November. (Applause)
p120
aV(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VSo in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,
p123
aVwas more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,
p124
aVand then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
p125
aVIt was consuming so much of our time after hours
p126
aVon weekends that we thought, we either need
p127
aVto close this down or figure a way to fund Movember
p128
aVso that I could quit my job and go and spend more time
p129
aVin the organization and take it to the next level.
p130
aa(lp131
VIt's really interesting when you try and figure a way
p132
aVto fund a fundraising organization
p133
aVbuilt off growing mustaches. (Laughter)
p134
aVLet me tell you that there's not too many people interested
p135
aVin investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,
p136
aVwho we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.
p137
aVSo again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party
p138
aVand gave us our first ever sponsorship,
p139
aVand that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.
p140
aVAnd leading into Movember 2006,
p141
aVwe'd run through all the money from Foster's,
p142
aVwe'd run through all the money I had, and essentially
p143
aVwe had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers \u2014
p144
aVcreative agencies, web development agencies,
p145
aVhosting companies, whatnot \u2014 to delay their billing until December.
p146
aVSo we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars
p147
aVworth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,
p148
aVthe four founders, well, we would've been broke,
p149
aVwe would've been homeless, sitting on the street
p150
aVwith mustaches. (Laughter)
p151
aVBut we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing
p152
aVthat happens, so what?
p153
aVWe're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us
p154
aVthe importance of taking risks and really smart risks.
p155
aa(lp156
VThen in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.
p157
aVWe had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,
p158
aVand from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,
p159
aVhey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.
p160
aVBring this campaign to these countries.
p161
aVSo we thought, why not? Let's do it.
p162
aVSo I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,
p163
aVand I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept."
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aV"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want
p166
aVto tell you about it now, but will you meet with me
p167
aVif I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here,
p168
aVmet down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,
p169
aVand I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches
p170
aVall across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."
p171
aVAnd he looked at me and laughed and said,
p172
aV"Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're
p173
aVan ultraconservative organization." (Laughter)
p174
aVI've heard this before. I know how it goes.
p175
aVBut he said, "We will partner with you,
p176
aVbut we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure
p177
aVa way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."
p178
aa(lp179
VSo what we did was, we took some of the money that
p180
aVwe raised in Australia to bring the campaign across
p181
aVto this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that
p182
aVbecause we knew, if this was successful,
p183
aVwe could raise infinitely more money globally
p184
aVthan we could just in Australia. And that money
p185
aVfuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.
p186
aVAnd we're not about finding an Australian cure
p187
aVor a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,
p190
aVand it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
p191
aVIt wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.
p192
aVWe were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia
p193
aVand New Zealand at that stage.
p194
aVSo that year really taught us the importance of being patient
p195
aVand really understanding the local market before you
p196
aVbecome so bold as to set lofty targets.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,
p199
aVMovember became a truly global movement.
p200
aVCanada was just pipped to the post in terms of
p201
aVthe number one fundraising campaign in the world.
p202
aVLast year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world
p203
aVand together we raised 77 million dollars.
p204
aV(Applause)
p205
aVAnd that makes Movember now the biggest funder
p206
aVof prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.
p207
aVAnd that is an amazing achievement when you think about
p208
aVus growing mustaches. (Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd for us, we have redefined charity.
p211
aVOur ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)
p212
aVOur ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,
p213
aVand I think that's been fundamental to our success.
p214
aVWe hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.
p215
aVWe let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo now I live in Los Angeles, because
p218
aVthe Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,
p219
aVand I always get asked by the media down there,
p220
aVbecause it's so celebrity-driven,
p221
aV"Who are your celebrity ambassadors?"
p222
aVAnd I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough
p223
aVto have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors."
p224
aVAnd they go, "What, what do you mean?"
p225
aVAnd it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro
p226
aVand Mo Sista that participates in Movember
p227
aVis our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important
p228
aVand fundamental to our success.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow what I want to share with you is
p231
aVone of my most touching Movember moments,
p232
aVand it happened here in Toronto last year,
p233
aVat the end of the campaign.
p234
aVI was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.
p235
aVWe'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had
p236
aVour fair share of beer that night, but I said,
p237
aV"You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us." (Laughter)
p238
aVSo we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,
p239
aVand I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around
p240
aVand said, "Where are you going?"
p241
aVAnd I said, "Hang on, that is an amazing mustache."
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVAnd he said, "I'm doing it for Movember." And I said,
p244
aV"So am I." And I said, "Tell me your Movember story."
p245
aVAnd he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health,
p246
aVI know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer."
p247
aVAnd I said, "Okay, that's interesting."
p248
aVAnd he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,
p249
aVbecause we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,"
p250
aVand he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom."
p251
aVAnd we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,
p252
aVand I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,
p253
aVand I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.
p254
aVYour mom would be so proud."
p255
aVAnd from that moment I realized that Movember
p256
aVis so much more than a mustache, having a joke.
p257
aVIt's about each person coming to this platform,
p258
aVembracing it in their own way,
p259
aVand being significant in their own life.
p260
aa(lp261
VFor us now at Movember, we really focus on
p262
aVthree program areas, and having a true impact:
p263
aVawareness and education,
p264
aVsurvivor support programs, and research.
p265
aVNow we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,
p266
aVbecause it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,
p267
aVawareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,
p268
aVbecause I know that is changing and saving lives today,
p269
aVand it's probably best exampled by
p270
aVa young guy that I met at South by Southwest
p271
aVin Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.
p272
aVHe came up to me and said, "Thank you for starting Movember."
p273
aVAnd I said, "Thank you for doing Movember."
p274
aVAnd I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache." (Laughter)
p275
aVAnd I said, "What's your Movember story?"
p276
aVAnd he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter)
p277
aV"But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly
p278
aVthe conversation around the table turned to
p279
aVwhat the hell was going on." (Laughter)
p280
aV"And we talked \u2014 I talked to them about Movember,
p281
aVand then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age
p282
aVof 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad
p283
aVone on one about men's health. I had a conversation
p284
aVwith my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned
p285
aVthat my grandfather had prostate cancer
p286
aVand I was able to share with my dad that he was
p287
aVtwice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,
p288
aVand he hadn't been getting screened for it."
p289
aVSo now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo those conversations, getting men engaged in this,
p292
aVat whatever age, is so critically important,
p293
aVand in my view so much more important
p294
aVthan the funds we raise.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow to the funds we raise, and research,
p297
aVand how we're redefining research.
p298
aVWe fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.
p299
aVWe literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions
p300
aVand researchers around the world, and when we looked
p301
aVat this more recently, we realized there's a real lack
p302
aVof collaboration going on even within institutions,
p303
aVlet alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique
p304
aVto prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.
p305
aVAnd so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need
p306
aVto redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?
p307
aVSo what we did was, we created a global action plan,
p308
aVand we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country
p309
aVnow and putting it into a global fund, and we've got
p310
aVthe best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world
p311
aVthat look after that fund,
p312
aVand they come together each year and identify
p313
aVthe number one priority,
p314
aVand that, last year, was getting a better screening test.
p315
aVSo they identified that as a priority, and then
p316
aVthey've got and recruited now 300 researchers
p317
aVfrom around the world that are studying that topic,
p318
aVessentially the same topic.
p319
aVSo now we're funding them to the tune of about
p320
aVfive or six million dollars to collaborate
p321
aVand bringing them together, and that's a unique thing
p322
aVin the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,
p323
aVit will accelerate outcomes.
p324
aVAnd that's how we're redefining the research world.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo, what I know about my Movember journey is that,
p327
aVwith a really creative idea,
p328
aVwith passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,
p329
aVfour mates, four mustaches,
p330
aVcan inspire a room full of people,
p331
aVand that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,
p332
aVand that city is Melbourne, my home.
p333
aVAnd that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state
p334
aVcan go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,
p335
aVyou can create a global movement
p336
aVthat is changing the face of men's health.
p337
aa(lp338
VMy name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.
p339
aVThank you. (Applause)
