VYou may be wondering
p4
aVwhy a marine biologist from Oceana
p5
aVwould come here today to talk to you
p6
aVabout world hunger.
p7
aVI'm here today because
p8
aVsaving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.
p9
aVIt's more than a thing we're doing
p10
aVbecause we want to create jobs for fishermen
p11
aVor preserve fishermen's jobs.
p12
aVIt's more than an economic pursuit.
p13
aVSaving the oceans can feed the world.
p14
aVLet me show you how.
p15
aa(lp16
VAs you know, there are already
p17
aVmore than a billion hungry people on this planet.
p18
aVWe're expecting that problem to get worse
p19
aVas world population grows to nine billion
p20
aVor 10 billion by midcentury,
p21
aVand we can expect to have greater pressure
p22
aVon our food resources.
p23
aVAnd this is a big concern,
p24
aVespecially considering where we are now.
p25
aVNow we know that our arable land per capita
p26
aVis already on the decline
p27
aVin both developed and developing countries.
p28
aVWe know that we're headed for climate change,
p29
aVwhich is going to change rainfall patterns,
p30
aVmaking some areas drier, as you can see in orange,
p31
aVand others wetter, in blue,
p32
aVcausing droughts in our breadbaskets,
p33
aVin places like the Midwest and Central Europe,
p34
aVand floods in others.
p35
aVIt's going to make it harder for the land
p36
aVto help us solve the hunger problem.
p37
aVAnd that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant,
p38
aVso that the oceans can provide us
p39
aVas much food as possible.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd that's something the oceans have been doing
p42
aVfor us for a long time.
p43
aVAs far back as we can go, we've seen an increase
p44
aVin the amount of food we've been able to harvest
p45
aVfrom our oceans.
p46
aVIt just seemed like it was continuing to increase,
p47
aVuntil about 1980,
p48
aVwhen we started to see a decline.
p49
aVYou've heard of peak oil.
p50
aVMaybe this is peak fish.
p51
aVI hope not. I'm going to come back to that.
p52
aVBut you can see about an 18-percent decline
p53
aVin the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch
p54
aVsince 1980.
p55
aVAnd this is a big problem. It's continuing.
p56
aVThis red line is continuing to go down.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut we know how to turn it around,
p59
aVand that's what I'm going to talk about today.
p60
aVWe know how to turn that curve back upwards.
p61
aVThis doesn't have to be peak fish.
p62
aVIf we do a few simple things in targeted places,
p63
aVwe can bring our fisheries back and use them
p64
aVto feed people.
p65
aa(lp66
VFirst we want to know where the fish are,
p67
aVso let's look where the fish are.
p68
aVIt turns out the fish, conveniently,
p69
aVare located for the most part
p70
aVin our coastal areas of the countries,
p71
aVin coastal zones,
p72
aVand these are areas that national jurisdictions
p73
aVhave control over,
p74
aVand they can manage their fisheries
p75
aVin these coastal areas.
p76
aVCoastal countries tend to have jurisdictions
p77
aVthat go out about 200 nautical miles,
p78
aVin areas that are called exclusive economic zones,
p79
aVand this is a good thing that they can control
p80
aVtheir fisheries in these areas,
p81
aVbecause the high seas,
p82
aVwhich are the darker areas on this map,
p83
aVthe high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,
p84
aVbecause it has to be done internationally.
p85
aVYou get into international agreements,
p86
aVand if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement,
p87
aVyou know this can be a very slow,
p88
aVfrustrating, tedious process.
p89
aVAnd so controlling things nationally
p90
aVis a great thing to be able to do.
p91
aa(lp92
VHow many fish are actually in these coastal areas
p93
aVcompared to the high seas?
p94
aVWell, you can see here about
p95
aVseven times as many fish in the coastal areas
p96
aVthan there are in the high seas,
p97
aVso this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,
p98
aVbecause we can actually get a lot done.
p99
aVWe can restore a lot of our fisheries
p100
aVif we focus in these coastal areas.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut how many of these countries do we have to work in?
p103
aVThere's something like 80 coastal countries.
p104
aVDo we have to fix fisheries management
p105
aVin all of those countries?
p106
aVSo we asked ourselves, how many countries
p107
aVdo we need to focus on,
p108
aVkeeping in mind that the European Union
p109
aVconveniently manages its fisheries
p110
aVthrough a common fisheries policy?
p111
aVSo if we got good fisheries management
p112
aVin the European Union and, say, nine other countries,
p113
aVhow much of our fisheries would we be covering?
p114
aVTurns out, European Union plus nine countries
p115
aVcovers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.
p116
aVIf we took it up to 24 countries plus the European Union,
p117
aVwe would up to 90 percent,
p118
aValmost all of the world's fish catch.
p119
aVSo we think we can work in a limited number of places
p120
aVto make the fisheries come back.
p121
aVBut what do we have to do in these places?
p122
aVWell, based on our work in the United States
p123
aVand elsewhere, we know that there are
p124
aVthree key things we have to do
p125
aVto bring fisheries back, and they are:
p126
aVWe need to set quotas or limits
p127
aVon how much we take;
p128
aVwe need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental
p129
aVcatching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,
p130
aVand it's very wasteful;
p131
aVand three, we need to protect habitats,
p132
aVthe nursery areas, the spawning areas
p133
aVthat these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully
p134
aVso that they can rebuild their populations.
p135
aVIf we do those three things, we  know the fisheries will come back.
p136
aa(lp137
VHow do we know?
p138
aVWe know because we've seen it happening
p139
aVin a lot of different places.
p140
aVThis is a slide that shows
p141
aVthe herring population in Norway
p142
aVthat was crashing since the 1950s.
p143
aVIt was coming down, and when Norway set limits,
p144
aVor quotas, on its fishery, what happens?
p145
aVThe fishery comes back.
p146
aVThis is another example, also happens to be from Norway,
p147
aVof the Norwegian Arctic cod.
p148
aVSame deal. The fishery is crashing.
p149
aVThey set limits on discards.
p150
aVDiscards are these fish they weren't targeting
p151
aVand they get thrown overboard wastefully.
p152
aVWhen they set the discard limit,
p153
aVthe fishery came back.
p154
aVAnd it's not just in Norway.
p155
aVWe've seen this happening in countries
p156
aVall around the world, time and time again.
p157
aVWhen these countries step in and they
p158
aVput in sustainable fisheries management policies,
p159
aVthe fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,
p160
aVare starting to come back.
p161
aVSo there's a lot of promise here.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat does this mean for the world fish catch?
p164
aVThis means that if we take that fishery catch
p165
aVthat's on the decline
p166
aVand we could turn it upwards, we could increase it
p167
aVup to 100 million metric tons per year.
p168
aVSo we didn't have peak fish yet.
p169
aVWe still have an opportunity
p170
aVto not only bring the fish back
p171
aVbut to actually get more fish
p172
aVthat can feed more people
p173
aVthan we currently are now.
p174
aVHow many more? Right about now,
p175
aVwe can feed about 450 million people
p176
aVa fish meal a day
p177
aVbased on the current world fish catch,
p178
aVwhich, of course, you know is going down,
p179
aVso that number will go down over time
p180
aVif we don't fix it,
p181
aVbut if we put fishery management practices
p182
aVlike the ones I've described in place
p183
aVin 10 to 25 countries,
p184
aVwe could bring that number up
p185
aVand feed as many as 700 million people a year
p186
aVa healthy fish meal.
p187
aa(lp188
VWe should obviously do this just because
p189
aVit's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,
p190
aVbut it's also cost-effective.
p191
aVIt turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein
p192
aVon the planet.
p193
aVIf you look at how much fish protein you get
p194
aVper dollar invested
p195
aVcompared to all of the other animal proteins,
p196
aVobviously, fish is a good business decision.
p197
aVIt also doesn't need a lot of land,
p198
aVsomething that's in short supply,
p199
aVcompared to other protein sources.
p200
aVAnd it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.
p201
aVIt uses a lot less fresh water than,
p202
aVfor example, cattle,
p203
aVwhere you have to irrigate a field
p204
aVso that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.
p205
aVIt also has a very low carbon footprint.
p206
aVIt has a little bit of a carbon footprint
p207
aVbecause we do have to get out and catch the fish.
p208
aVIt takes a little bit of fuel,
p209
aVbut as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint,
p210
aVand fish has a much smaller one,
p211
aVso it's less polluting.
p212
aVIt's already a big part of our diet,
p213
aVbut it can be a bigger part of our diet,
p214
aVwhich is a good thing, because we know
p215
aVthat it's healthy for us.
p216
aVIt can reduce our risks of cancer,
p217
aVheart disease and obesity.
p218
aVIn fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,
p219
aVwho is the originator of this concept, actually,
p220
aVhe likes to say fish is the perfect protein.
p221
aVAndy also talks about the fact that
p222
aVour ocean conservation movement really grew
p223
aVout of the land conservation movement,
p224
aVand in land conservation,
p225
aVwe have this problem where biodiversity
p226
aVis at war with food production.
p227
aVYou have to cut down the biodiverse forest
p228
aVif you want to get the field
p229
aVto grow the corn to feed people with,
p230
aVand so there's a constant push-pull there.
p231
aVThere's a constant tough decision
p232
aVthat has to be made between
p233
aVtwo very important things:
p234
aVmaintaining biodiversity and feeding people.
p235
aVBut in the oceans, we don't have that war.
p236
aVIn the oceans, biodiversity is not at war
p237
aVwith abundance.
p238
aVIn fact, they're aligned.
p239
aVWhen we do things that produce biodiversity,
p240
aVwe actually get more abundance,
p241
aVand that's important so that we can feed people.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, there's a catch.
p244
aa(lp245
VDidn't anyone get that? (Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VIllegal fishing.
p248
aVIllegal fishing undermines the type of
p249
aVsustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.
p250
aVIt can be when you catch fish using gears
p251
aVthat have been prohibited,
p252
aVwhen you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish,
p253
aVyou catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species.
p254
aVIllegal fishing cheats the consumer
p255
aVand it also cheats honest fishermen,
p256
aVand it needs to stop.
p257
aVThe way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud.
p258
aVYou might have heard about this.
p259
aVIt's when fish are labeled as something they're not.
p260
aVThink about the last time you had fish.
p261
aVWhat were you eating?
p262
aVAre you sure that's what it was?
p263
aVBecause we tested 1,300 different fish samples
p264
aVand about a third of them
p265
aVwere not what they were labeled to be.
p266
aVSnappers, nine out of 10 snappers were not snapper.
p267
aVFifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested
p268
aVwas mislabeled.
p269
aVAnd red snapper, we tested 120 samples,
p270
aVand only seven of them were really red snapper,
p271
aVso good luck finding a red snapper.
p272
aa(lp273
VSeafood has a really complex supply chain,
p274
aVand at every step in this supply chain,
p275
aVthere's an opportunity for seafood fraud,
p276
aVunless we have traceability.
p277
aVTraceability is a way where the seafood industry
p278
aVcan track the seafood from the boat to the plate
p279
aVto make sure that the consumer can then find out
p280
aVwhere their seafood came from.
p281
aa(lp282
VThis is a really important thing.
p283
aVIt's being done by some in the industry, but not enough,
p284
aVso we're pushing a law in Congress
p285
aVcalled the SAFE Seafood Act,
p286
aVand I'm very excited today to announce the release
p287
aVof a chef's petition, where 450 chefs
p288
aVhave signed a petition calling on Congress
p289
aVto support the SAFE Seafood Act.
p290
aVIt has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know \u2014
p291
aVAnthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,
p292
aVBarton Seaver and others \u2014
p293
aVand they've signed it because they believe
p294
aVthat people have a right to know
p295
aVabout what they're eating.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VFishermen like it too, so there's a good chance
p300
aVwe can get the kind of support we need
p301
aVto get this bill through,
p302
aVand it comes at a critical time,
p303
aVbecause this is the way we stop seafood fraud,
p304
aVthis is the way we curb illegal fishing,
p305
aVand this is the way we make sure
p306
aVthat quotas, habitat protection,
p307
aVand bycatch reductions can do the jobs
p308
aVthey can do.
p309
aa(lp310
VWe know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably.
p311
aVWe know that we can produce
p312
aVhealthy meals for hundreds of millions of people
p313
aVthat don't use the land, that don't use much water,
p314
aVhave a low carbon footprint,
p315
aVand are cost-effective.
p316
aVWe know that saving the oceans
p317
aVcan feed the world,
p318
aVand we need to start now.
