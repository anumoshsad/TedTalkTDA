VI have a confession to make.
p4
aVBut first, I want you to make a little confession to me.
p5
aVIn the past year, I want you to just raise your hand
p6
aVif you've experienced relatively little stress.
p7
aVAnyone?
p8
aa(lp9
VHow about a moderate amount of stress?
p10
aa(lp11
VWho has experienced a lot of stress?
p12
aVYeah. Me too.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut that is not my confession.
p15
aVMy confession is this:
p16
aVI am a health psychologist,
p17
aVand my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.
p18
aVBut I fear that something I've been teaching
p19
aVfor the last 10 years is doing more harm than good,
p20
aVand it has to do with stress.
p21
aVFor years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.
p22
aVIt increases the risk of everything from the common cold
p23
aVto cardiovascular disease.
p24
aVBasically, I've turned stress into the enemy.
p25
aVBut I have changed my mind about stress,
p26
aVand today, I want to change yours.
p27
aa(lp28
VLet me start with the study that made me rethink
p29
aVmy whole approach to stress.
p30
aVThis study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years,
p31
aVand they started by asking people,
p32
aV"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
p33
aVThey also asked,
p34
aV"Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"
p35
aVAnd then they used public death records to find out who died.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VOkay.
p40
aVSome bad news first.
p41
aVPeople who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year
p42
aVhad a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
p43
aVBut that was only true for the people
p44
aVwho also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VPeople who experienced a lot of stress
p49
aVbut did not view stress as harmful
p50
aVwere no more likely to die.
p51
aVIn fact, they had the lowest risk of dying
p52
aVof anyone in the study,
p53
aVincluding people who had relatively little stress.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow the researchers estimated that over the eight years
p56
aVthey were tracking deaths,
p57
aV182,000 Americans died prematurely,
p58
aVnot from stress,
p59
aVbut from the belief that stress is bad for you.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VThat is over 20,000 deaths a year.
p64
aVNow, if that estimate is correct,
p65
aVthat would make believing stress is bad for you
p66
aVthe 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year,
p67
aVkilling more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VYou can see why this study freaked me out.
p72
aVHere I've been spending so much energy telling people
p73
aVstress is bad for your health.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo this study got me wondering:
p76
aVCan changing how you think about stress make you healthier?
p77
aVAnd here the science says yes.
p78
aVWhen you change your mind about stress,
p79
aVyou can change your body's response to stress.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow to explain how this works,
p82
aVI want you all to pretend that you are participants
p83
aVin a study designed to stress you out.
p84
aVIt's called the social stress test.
p85
aVYou come into the laboratory,
p86
aVand you're told you have to give
p87
aVa five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses
p88
aVto a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,
p89
aVand to make sure you feel the pressure,
p90
aVthere are bright lights and a camera in your face,
p91
aVkind of like this.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd the evaluators have been trained
p96
aVto give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback,
p97
aVlike this.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Exhales)
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VNow that you're sufficiently demoralized,
p104
aVtime for part two: a math test.
p105
aVAnd unbeknownst to you,
p106
aVthe experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.
p107
aVNow we're going to all do this together.
p108
aVIt's going to be fun.
p109
aVFor me.
p110
aa(lp111
VOkay.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VI want you all to count backwards from 996
p116
aVin increments of seven.
p117
aVYou're going to do this out loud,
p118
aVas fast as you can,
p119
aVstarting with 996.
p120
aVGo!
p121
aa(lp122
V(Audience counting)
p123
aa(lp124
VGo faster. Faster please.
p125
aVYou're going too slow.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Audience counting)
p128
aa(lp129
VStop. Stop, stop, stop.
p130
aVThat guy made a mistake.
p131
aVWe are going to have to start all over again.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VYou're not very good at this, are you?
p136
aVOkay, so you get the idea.
p137
aVIf you were actually in this study,
p138
aVyou'd probably be a little stressed out.
p139
aVYour heart might be pounding,
p140
aVyou might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.
p141
aVAnd normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety
p142
aVor signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut what if you viewed them instead
p145
aVas signs that your body was energized,
p146
aVwas preparing you to meet this challenge?
p147
aVNow that is exactly what participants were told
p148
aVin a study conducted at Harvard University.
p149
aVBefore they went through the social stress test,
p150
aVthey were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
p151
aVThat pounding heart is preparing you for action.
p152
aVIf you're breathing faster, it's no problem.
p153
aVIt's getting more oxygen to your brain.
p154
aVAnd participants who learned to view the stress response
p155
aVas helpful for their performance,
p156
aVwell, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident,
p157
aVbut the most fascinating finding to me
p158
aVwas how their physical stress response changed.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, in a typical stress response,
p161
aVyour heart rate goes up,
p162
aVand your blood vessels constrict like this.
p163
aVAnd this is one of the reasons that chronic stress
p164
aVis sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.
p165
aVIt's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.
p166
aVBut in the study,
p167
aVwhen participants viewed their stress response as helpful,
p168
aVtheir blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.
p169
aVTheir heart was still pounding,
p170
aVbut this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.
p171
aVIt actually looks a lot like what happens
p172
aVin moments of joy and courage.
p173
aVOver a lifetime of stressful experiences,
p174
aVthis one biological change
p175
aVcould be the difference
p176
aVbetween a stress-induced heart attack at age 50
p177
aVand living well into your 90s.
p178
aVAnd this is really what the new science of stress reveals,
p179
aVthat how you think about stress matters.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo my goal as a health psychologist has changed.
p182
aVI no longer want to get rid of your stress.
p183
aVI want to make you better at stress.
p184
aVAnd we just did a little intervention.
p185
aVIf you raised your hand and said
p186
aVyou'd had a lot of stress in the last year,
p187
aVwe could have saved your life,
p188
aVbecause hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress,
p189
aVyou're going to remember this talk
p190
aVand you're going to think to yourself,
p191
aVthis is my body helping me rise to this challenge.
p192
aVAnd when you view stress in that way,
p193
aVyour body believes you,
p194
aVand your stress response becomes healthier.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress
p197
aVto redeem myself from,
p198
aVso we are going to do one more intervention.
p199
aVI want to tell you
p200
aVabout one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response,
p201
aVand the idea is this:
p202
aVStress makes you social.
p203
aa(lp204
VTo understand this side of stress,
p205
aVwe need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,
p206
aVand I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.
p207
aVIt even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,
p208
aVbecause it's released when you hug someone.
p209
aVBut this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.
p210
aa(lp211
VOxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
p212
aVIt fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.
p213
aVIt primes you to do things
p214
aVthat strengthen close relationships.
p215
aVOxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.
p216
aVIt enhances your empathy.
p217
aVIt even makes you more willing to help and support
p218
aVthe people you care about.
p219
aVSome people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin...
p220
aVto become more compassionate and caring.
p221
aVBut here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
p222
aVIt's a stress hormone.
p223
aVYour pituitary gland pumps this stuff out
p224
aVas part of the stress response.
p225
aVIt's as much a part of your stress response
p226
aVas the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.
p227
aVAnd when oxytocin is released in the stress response,
p228
aVit is motivating you to seek support.
p229
aVYour biological stress response
p230
aVis nudging you to tell someone how you feel,
p231
aVinstead of bottling it up.
p232
aVYour stress response wants to make sure you notice
p233
aVwhen someone else in your life is struggling
p234
aVso that you can support each other.
p235
aVWhen life is difficult,
p236
aVyour stress response wants you to be surrounded
p237
aVby people who care about you.
p238
aa(lp239
VOkay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?
p240
aVWell, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
p241
aVIt also acts on your body,
p242
aVand one of its main roles in your body
p243
aVis to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
p244
aVIt's a natural anti-inflammatory.
p245
aVIt also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.
p246
aVBut my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.
p247
aVYour heart has receptors for this hormone,
p248
aVand oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate
p249
aVand heal from any stress-induced damage.
p250
aVThis stress hormone strengthens your heart.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits
p253
aVof oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.
p254
aVSo when you reach out to others under stress,
p255
aVeither to seek support or to help someone else,
p256
aVyou release more of this hormone,
p257
aVyour stress response becomes healthier,
p258
aVand you actually recover faster from stress.
p259
aVI find this amazing,
p260
aVthat your stress response has a built-in mechanism
p261
aVfor stress resilience,
p262
aVand that mechanism is human connection.
p263
aa(lp264
VI want to finish by telling you about one more study.
p265
aVAnd listen up, because this study could also save a life.
p266
aVThis study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States,
p267
aVand they ranged in age from 34 to 93,
p268
aVand they started the study by asking,
p269
aV"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"
p270
aVThey also asked,
p271
aV"How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors,
p272
aVpeople in your community?"
p273
aVAnd then they used public records for the next five years
p274
aVto find out who died.
p275
aa(lp276
VOkay, so the bad news first:
p277
aVFor every major stressful life experience,
p278
aVlike financial difficulties or family crisis,
p279
aVthat increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.
p280
aVBut \u2014 and I hope you are expecting a "but" by now \u2014
p281
aVbut that wasn't true for everyone.
p282
aVPeople who spent time caring for others
p283
aVshowed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying.
p284
aVZero.
p285
aVCaring created resilience.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd so we see once again
p288
aVthat the harmful effects of stress on your health
p289
aVare not inevitable.
p290
aVHow you think and how you act
p291
aVcan transform your experience of stress.
p292
aVWhen you choose to view your stress response as helpful,
p293
aVyou create the biology of courage.
p294
aVAnd when you choose to connect with others under stress,
p295
aVyou can create resilience.
p296
aVNow I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life,
p297
aVbut this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.
p298
aVStress gives us access to our hearts.
p299
aVThe compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning
p300
aVin connecting with others,
p301
aVand yes, your pounding physical heart,
p302
aVworking so hard to give you strength and energy.
p303
aVAnd when you choose to view stress in this way,
p304
aVyou're not just getting better at stress,
p305
aVyou're actually making a pretty profound statement.
p306
aVYou're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.
p307
aVAnd you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VChris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.
p314
aVIt seems amazing to me that a belief about stress
p315
aVcan make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.
p316
aVHow would that extend to advice,
p317
aVlike, if someone is making a lifestyle choice
p318
aVbetween, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job,
p319
aVdoes it matter which way they go?
p320
aVIt's equally wise to go for the stressful job
p321
aVso long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?
p322
aa(lp323
VKM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain
p324
aVis that chasing meaning is better for your health
p325
aVthan trying to avoid discomfort.
p326
aVAnd so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,
p327
aVis go after what it is that creates meaning in your life
p328
aVand then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.
p329
aa(lp330
VCA: Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool.
