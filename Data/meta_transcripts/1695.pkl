VChris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream
p4
aVwould persuade you to think of trying
p5
aVto take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?
p6
aa(lp7
VElon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.
p8
aVI thought about, what are the problems that are most likely
p9
aVto affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?
p10
aVI think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport
p11
aVand sustainable energy production.
p12
aVThat sort of overall sustainable energy problem
p13
aVis the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,
p14
aVindependent of environmental concerns.
p15
aVIn fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,
p16
aVgiven that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,
p17
aVwe need to find some sustainable means of operating.
p18
aa(lp19
VCA: Most of American electricity comes from
p20
aVburning fossil fuels.
p21
aVHow can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?
p22
aa(lp23
VEM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.
p24
aVOne is that, even if you take the same source fuel
p25
aVand produce power at the power plant
p26
aVand use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.
p27
aVSo if you take, say, natural gas,
p28
aVwhich is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,
p29
aVif you burn that in a modern
p30
aVGeneral Electric natural gas turbine,
p31
aVyou'll get about 60 percent efficiency.
p32
aVIf you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,
p33
aVyou get about 20 percent efficiency.
p34
aVAnd the reason is, in the stationary power plant,
p35
aVyou can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,
p36
aVis voluminous,
p37
aVand you can take the waste heat
p38
aVand run a steam turbine and generate
p39
aVa secondary power source.
p40
aVSo in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,
p41
aVeven using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off
p42
aVcharging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.
p43
aa(lp44
VCA: That scale delivers efficiency.
p45
aa(lp46
VEM: Yes, it does.
p47
aVAnd then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means
p48
aVof power generation anyway, electricity generation.
p49
aVSo given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,
p50
aVthen it makes sense for us to have electric cars
p51
aVas the mode of transport.
p52
aa(lp53
VCA: So we've got some video here
p54
aVof the Tesla being assembled,
p55
aVwhich, if we could play that first video \u2014
p56
aVSo what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?
p57
aa(lp58
VEM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,
p59
aVand I should say that I think, actually,
p60
aVall modes of transport will become fully electric
p61
aVwith the ironic exception of rockets.
p62
aVThere's just no way around Newton's third law.
p63
aVThe question is how do you accelerate
p64
aVthe advent of electric transport?
p65
aVAnd in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with
p66
aVa really energy efficient car,
p67
aVso that means making it incredibly light,
p68
aVand so what you're seeing here
p69
aVis the only all-aluminum body and chassis car
p70
aVmade in North America.
p71
aVIn fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques
p72
aVto make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.
p73
aVAnd then it also has the lowest drag coefficient
p74
aVof any car of its size.
p75
aVSo as a result, the energy usage is very low,
p76
aVand it has the most advanced battery pack,
p77
aVand that's what gives it the range that's competitive,
p78
aVso you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.
p79
aa(lp80
VCA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,
p81
aVbut you think the math can still work out intelligently \u2014
p82
aVby combining light body, heavy battery,
p83
aVyou can still gain spectacular efficiency.
p84
aa(lp85
VEM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light
p86
aVto offset the mass of the pack,
p87
aVand then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.
p88
aVAnd in fact, customers of the Model S
p89
aVare sort of competing with each other
p90
aVto try to get the highest possible range.
p91
aVI think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.
p92
aa(lp93
VCA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,
p94
aVbroke the world record.EM: Congratulations.
p95
aa(lp96
VCA: That was the good news. The bad news was that
p97
aVto do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed
p98
aVand got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VEM: I mean, you can certainly drive \u2014
p101
aVif you drive it 65 miles an hour,
p102
aVunder normal conditions,
p103
aV250 miles is a reasonable number.
p104
aa(lp105
VCA: Let's show that second video
p106
aVshowing the Tesla in action on ice.
p107
aVNot at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.
p108
aVWhat is the most surprising thing about the experience
p109
aVof driving the car?
p110
aa(lp111
VEM: In creating an electric car,
p112
aVthe responsiveness of the car is really incredible.
p113
aVSo we wanted really to have people feel as though
p114
aVthey've almost got to mind meld with the car,
p115
aVso you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,
p116
aVand as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,
p117
aVlike the car has ESP.
p118
aVYou can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.
p119
aVYou can't do that with a gasoline car.
p120
aVI think that's really a profound difference,
p121
aVand people only experience that when they have a test drive.
p122
aa(lp123
VCA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.
p124
aVIs there a road map where this becomes
p125
aVa mass-market vehicle?
p126
aa(lp127
VEM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been
p128
aVto have a sort of three-step process,
p129
aVwhere version one was an expensive car at low volume,
p130
aVversion two is medium priced and medium volume,
p131
aVand then version three would be low price, high volume.
p132
aVSo we're at step two at this point.
p133
aVSo we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.
p134
aVThen we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.
p135
aVAnd our third generation car, which should hopefully
p136
aVbe out in about three or four years
p137
aVwill be a $30,000 car.
p138
aVBut whenever you've got really new technology,
p139
aVit generally takes about three major versions
p140
aVin order to make it a compelling mass-market product.
p141
aVAnd so I think we're making progress in that direction,
p142
aVand I feel confident that we'll get there.
p143
aa(lp144
VCA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,
p145
aVyou can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.
p146
aVThere isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.
p147
aVDo you see that coming, really, truly,
p148
aVor just on a few key routes?
p149
aa(lp150
VEM: There actually are far more charging stations
p151
aVthan people realize,
p152
aVand at Tesla we developed something
p153
aVcalled a Supercharging technology,
p154
aVand we're offering that if you buy a Model S
p155
aVfor free, forever.
p156
aVAnd so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.
p157
aVWe actually have California and Nevada covered,
p158
aVand we've got the Eastern seaboard
p159
aVfrom Boston to D.C. covered.
p160
aVBy the end of this year, you'll be able to drive
p161
aVfrom L.A. to New York
p162
aVjust using the Supercharger network,
p163
aVwhich charges at five times the rate of anything else.
p164
aVAnd the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,
p165
aVto stop time, of about six or seven.
p166
aVSo if you drive for three hours,
p167
aVyou want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,
p168
aVbecause that's normally what people will stop for.
p169
aVSo if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,
p170
aVby noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,
p171
aVhit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.
p172
aa(lp173
VCA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.
p174
aVSo it's common \u2014 don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.
p175
aVWait for an hour, but the good news is,
p176
aVyou're helping save the planet,
p177
aVand by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.
p178
aa(lp179
VEM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people
p180
aVto stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.
p181
aVIt's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles
p182
aVand then stop for half an hour
p183
aVand then keep going.
p184
aVThat's the natural cadence of a trip.
p185
aVCA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.
p186
aVYou've been working on this solar company SolarCity.
p187
aVWhat's unusual about that?
p188
aa(lp189
VEM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,
p190
aVwe have to have sustainable electricity production
p191
aVas well as consumption,
p192
aVso I'm quite confident that the primary means
p193
aVof power generation will be solar.
p194
aVI mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.
p195
aVWe've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,
p196
aVand we just need to tap a little bit of that energy
p197
aVfor purposes of human civilization.
p198
aVWhat most people know but don't realize they know
p199
aVis that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.
p200
aVIf the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball
p201
aVat three degrees Kelvin,
p202
aVand the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.
p203
aVThe whole ecosystem is solar-powered.
p204
aa(lp205
VCA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,
p206
aVeffectively, thousands of years of sun power
p207
aVcompressed into a small space,
p208
aVso it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,
p209
aVand to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,
p210
aVfracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?
p211
aa(lp212
VEM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar
p213
aVwill beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)CA: How?
p216
aa(lp217
VEM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.
p218
aa(lp219
VCA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.
p220
aVWhat are you doing?
p221
aVEM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system
p222
aVor you can lease a solar system.
p223
aVMost people choose to lease.
p224
aVAnd the thing about solar power is that
p225
aVit doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,
p226
aVso once it's installed, it's just there.
p227
aVIt works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.
p228
aVSo therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost
p229
aVof that initial installation low,
p230
aVand then get the cost of the financing low,
p231
aVbecause that interest \u2014 those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.
p232
aVAnd we've made huge progress in that direction,
p233
aVand that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.
p234
aa(lp235
VCA: So your current proposition to consumers is,
p236
aVdon't pay so much up front.
p237
aa(lp238
VEM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.
p239
aVWe will install panels on your roof.
p240
aVYou will then pay, how long is a typical lease?
p241
aa(lp242
VEM: Typical leases are 20 years,
p243
aVbut the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.
p244
aVIt's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.
p245
aVPretty good deal.
p246
aa(lp247
VCA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.
p248
aVNo risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.
p249
aVFor you, the dream here then is that \u2014
p250
aVI mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?
p251
aVI mean, how do you, the company, benefit?
p252
aa(lp253
VEM: Well, essentially,
p254
aVSolarCity raises a chunk of capital
p255
aVfrom say, a company or a bank.
p256
aVGoogle is one of our big partners here.
p257
aVAnd they have an expected return on that capital.
p258
aVWith that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof
p259
aVand then charges the homeowner or business owner
p260
aVa monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.
p261
aa(lp262
VCA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.
p263
aVYou're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.
p264
aa(lp265
VEM: Exactly. What it amounts to
p266
aVis a giant distributed utility.
p267
aVI think it's a good thing, because utilities
p268
aVhave been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.
p269
aVSo effectively it's the first time
p270
aVthere's been competition for this monopoly,
p271
aVbecause the utilities have been the only ones
p272
aVthat owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.
p273
aVSo I think it's actually very empowering
p274
aVfor homeowners and businesses.
p275
aa(lp276
VCA: And you really picture a future
p277
aVwhere a majority of power in America,
p278
aVwithin a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?
p279
aa(lp280
VEM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,
p281
aVand most likely a majority,
p282
aVand I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.
p283
aVI made that bet with someone \u2014CA: Definition of plurality is?
p284
aa(lp285
VEM: More from solar than any other source.
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?
p288
aa(lp289
VEM: With a friend who will remain nameless.
p290
aa(lp291
VCA: Just between us. (Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VEM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,
p294
aVso in roughly 18 years,
p295
aVI think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.
p296
aa(lp297
VCA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made
p298
aVwith yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.
p299
aVYou'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.
p300
aVYou decided to build a space company.
p301
aVWhy on Earth would someone do that?
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VEM: I got that question a lot, that's true.
p305
aVPeople would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy
p306
aVwho made a small fortune in the space industry?"
p307
aVObviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.
p308
aVAnd so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out
p309
aVthe fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.
p310
aVAnd they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"
p311
aa(lp312
VCA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?
p313
aa(lp314
VEM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.
p315
aVWe came very close to failure,
p316
aVbut we managed to get through that point in 2008.
p317
aVThe goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,
p318
aVand in particular to try to crack a problem
p319
aVthat I think is vital
p320
aVfor humanity to become a space-faring civilization,
p321
aVwhich is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.
p322
aa(lp323
VCA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?
p324
aVSo that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?
p325
aVYou've dreamed of Mars and beyond?
p326
aa(lp327
VEM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,
p328
aVbut I didn't think I'd be involved in this.
p329
aVIt was really more from the standpoint of
p330
aVwhat are the things that need to happen in order for
p331
aVthe future to be an exciting and inspiring one?
p332
aVAnd I really think there's a fundamental difference,
p333
aVif you sort of look into the future,
p334
aVbetween a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,
p335
aVthat's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,
p336
aVand I think that's really exciting,
p337
aVcompared with one where we are forever confined to Earth
p338
aVuntil some eventual extinction event.
p339
aa(lp340
VCA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building
p341
aVa rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.
p342
aVHow on Earth have you done that?
p343
aVNASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?
p344
aa(lp345
VEM: Well, we've made significant advances
p346
aVin the technology of the airframe, the engines,
p347
aVthe electronics and the launch operation.
p348
aVThere's a long list of innovations
p349
aVthat we've come up with there
p350
aVthat are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but \u2014
p351
aa(lp352
VCA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?
p353
aVYou haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.
p354
aa(lp355
VEM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's
p356
aVmore dangerous to patent than not to patent.
p357
aa(lp358
VEM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,
p359
aVthe enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VCA: That's really, really interesting.
p362
aVBut the big innovation is still ahead,
p363
aVand you're working on it now. Tell us about this.
p364
aa(lp365
VEM: Right, so the big innovation\u2014
p366
aa(lp367
VCA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.
p368
aa(lp369
VEM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that
p370
aVthey're all expendable.
p371
aVAll rockets that fly today are fully expendable.
p372
aVThe space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,
p373
aVbut even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,
p374
aVand the parts that were reusable
p375
aVtook a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.
p376
aVSo the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.
p377
aVObviously that doesn't work very well for \u2014
p378
aa(lp379
VCA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?
p380
aa(lp381
VEM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages
p382
aVbe able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site
p383
aVand be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.
p384
aa(lp385
VCA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)
p386
aVAnd so what a lot of people don't realize is,
p387
aVthe cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.
p388
aVIt's much like on a jet.
p389
aVSo the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent
p390
aVof the cost of the rocket.
p391
aVSo it's possible to achieve, let's say,
p392
aVroughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight
p393
aVif you can effectively reuse the rocket.
p394
aVThat's why it's so important.
p395
aVEvery mode of transport that we use,
p396
aVwhether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,
p397
aVis reusable, but not rockets.
p398
aVSo we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.
p399
aa(lp400
VCA: You asked me the question earlier
p401
aVof how popular traveling on cruises would be
p402
aVif you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.
p403
aa(lp404
VCA: Definitely more expensive.
p405
aVSo that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,
p406
aVand, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,
p407
aVat some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.
p408
aVYou'd like to see a colony on Mars.
p409
aa(lp410
VEM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination
p411
aVof companies and governments, needs to make progress
p412
aVin the direction of making life multi-planetary,
p413
aVof establishing a base on another planet,
p414
aVon Mars \u2014 being the only realistic option \u2014
p415
aVand then building that base up
p416
aVuntil we're a true multi-planet species.
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"
p419
aVhow is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.
p420
aVHow's it going?
p421
aa(lp422
VEM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently
p423
aVwith something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,
p424
aVwhere we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,
p425
aVthe sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.
p426
aVAnd we've had some good tests.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.
p429
aVSo that's just to give a sense of scale.
p430
aVWe dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash
p431
aVand bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)
p432
aa(lp433
VCA: All right, let's see that video then,
p434
aVbecause this is actually amazing when you think about it.
p435
aVYou've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then \u2014
p436
aa(lp437
VEM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size
p438
aVof a 12-story building.
p439
aV(Rocket launch)
p440
aVSo now it's hovering at about 40 meters,
p441
aVand it's constantly adjusting
p442

aVElon, how have you done this?
p447
aVThese projects are so \u2014 Paypal, SolarCity,
p448
aVTesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,
p449
aVthey're such ambitious projects at scale.
p450
aVHow on Earth has one person
p451
aVbeen able to innovate in this way?
p452
aVWhat is it about you?
p453
aa(lp454
VEM: I don't know, actually.
p455
aVI don't have a good answer for you.
p456
aVI work a lot. I mean, a lot.
p457
aa(lp458
VCA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: My theory is that you
p461
aVhave an ability to think at a system level of design
p462
aVthat pulls together design, technology and business,
p463
aVso if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,
p464
aVinto one package,
p465
aVsynthesize it in a way that very few people can and \u2014
p466
aVand this is the critical thing \u2014 feel so damn confident
p467
aVin that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.
p468
aVYou bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.
p469
aVI mean, almost no one can do that.
p470
aVIs that \u2014 could we have some of that secret sauce?
p471
aVCan we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?
p472
aVIt is truly amazing what you've done.
p473
aa(lp474
VEM: Well, thanks. Thank you.
p475
aVWell, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.
p476
aVIt is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.
p477
aVGenerally I think there are \u2014 what I mean by that is,
p478
aVboil things down to their fundamental truths
p479
aVand reason up from there,
p480
aVas opposed to reasoning by analogy.
p481
aVThrough most of our life, we get through life
p482
aVby reasoning by analogy,
p483
aVwhich essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.
p484
aVAnd you have to do that.
p485
aVOtherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.
p486
aVBut when you want to do something new,
p487
aVyou have to apply the physics approach.
p488
aVPhysics is really figuring out how to discover
p489
aVnew things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.
p490
aVIt's really counterintuitive.
p491
aVSo I think that's an important thing to do,
p492
aVand then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,
p493
aVand solicit it, particularly from friends.
p494
aVThis may sound like simple advice,
p495
aVbut hardly anyone does that,
p496
aVand it's incredibly helpful.
p497
aa(lp498
VCA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.
p499
aVLearn from this man.

aVElon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.
p501
aa(lp502
VEM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.
p503
aVLook at that. (Applause)
