VI'm an American, which means, generally,
p4
aVI ignore football unless it involves
p5
aVguys my size or Bruno's size
p6
aVrunning into each other at extremely high speeds.
p7
aVThat said, it's been really hard
p8
aVto ignore football
p9
aVfor the last couple of weeks.
p10
aVI go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:
p11
aVFIFA, vuvuzela,
p12
aVweird jokes about octopi.
p13
aVBut the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,
p14
aVthat I haven't been able to figure out,
p15
aVis this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p16
aVIf you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,
p17
aVyou've probably seen this.
p18
aVIt's been a major trending topic.
p19
aa(lp20
VBeing a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.
p21
aVSo I went onto Twitter,
p22
aVand I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p23
aVAnd fortunately, my Brazilian friends
p24
aVwere more than ready to help.
p25
aVThey explained that the Galvao bird
p26
aVis a rare and endangered parrot
p27
aVthat's in terrible, terrible danger.
p28
aVIn fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.
p29
aVNarrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird
p30
aVnative to Brazil.
p31
aVEvery year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds
p32
aVare killed during Carnival parades.
p33
aVEthan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,
p34
aVand it actually gets worse.
p35
aVIt turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot
p36
aVvery attractive, useful for headdresses,
p37
aVit evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,
p38
aVwhich means that there's a terrible problem
p39
aVwith Galvao abuse.
p40
aVSome sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.
p41
aVAnd it's terribly endangered.
p42
aVThe good news about this is that the global community \u2014
p43
aVagain, my Brazilian friends tell me \u2014
p44
aVis pitching in to help out.
p45
aVIt turns out that Lady Gaga
p46
aVhas released a new single \u2014
p47
aVactually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell \u2014
p48
aVtitled "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p49
aVAnd my Brazilian friends tell me that
p50
aVif I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"
p51
aV10 cents will be given
p52
aVto a global campaign
p53
aVto save this rare and beautiful bird.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,
p56
aVand actually a very, very good one.
p57
aV"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.
p58
aVIn Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."
p59
aVAnd it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,
p60
aVwho's the lead soccer commentator
p61
aVfor Rede Globo.
p62
aVAnd what I understand from my Brazilian friends
p63
aVis that this guy is just a cliche machine.
p64
aVHe can ruin the most interesting match
p65
aVby just spouting cliche again and again and again.
p66
aVSo Brazilians went to that first match
p67
aVagainst North Korea,
p68
aVput up this banner, started a Twitter campaign
p69
aVand tried to convince the rest of us
p70
aVto tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p71
aVAnd in fact, were so successful at this
p72
aVthat it topped Twitter for two weeks.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow there's a couple \u2014
p75
aVthere's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.
p76
aVAnd the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,
p77
aVis that you cannot go wrong
p78
aVasking people to be active online,
p79
aVso long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.
p80
aVSo as long as activism is that simple,
p81
aVit's pretty easy to get away with.
p82
aVThe other thing you can take from this, by the way,
p83
aVis that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.
p84
aVThere's more than five million of them.
p85
aVAs far as national representation,
p86
aV11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.
p87
aVThat's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
p88
aVNext to Japan,
p89
aVit's the second most represented by population.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow if you're using Twitter or other social networks,
p92
aVand you didn't realize
p93
aVthis was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,
p94
aVyou're like most of us.
p95
aVBecause what happens on a social network
p96
aVis you interact with the people
p97
aVthat you have chosen to interact with.
p98
aVAnd if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,
p99
aVyou tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.
p100
aVAnd you don't necessarily have the sense
p101
aVthat Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.
p102
aVIt's also extremely surprising to many Americans,
p103
aVa heavily African-American space.
p104
aVTwitter recently did some research.
p105
aVThey looked at their local population.
p106
aVThey believe that 24 percent
p107
aVof American Twitter users are African-American.
p108
aVThat's about twice as high as African-Americans
p109
aVare represented in the population.
p110
aVAnd again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,
p111
aVbut it shouldn't be.
p112
aVAnd the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day
p113
aVyou can go into Trending Topics.
p114
aVAnd you tend to find topics
p115
aVthat are almost entirely African-American conversations.
p116
aa(lp117
VThis was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas
p118
aVand Martin Wattenberg,
p119
aVtwo amazing visualization designers,
p120
aVwho looked at
p121
aVa weekend's worth of Twitter traffic
p122
aVand essentially found that a lot of these trending topics
p123
aVwere basically segregated conversations \u2014
p124
aVand in ways that you wouldn't expect.
p125
aVIt turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,
p126
aVthat cookout
p127
aVis a mostly black conversation.
p128
aVAnd what's crazy about this is that
p129
aVif you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,
p130
aVit's literally a quick click away.
p131
aVYou click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation
p132
aVwith different people participating in it.
p133
aVBut generally speaking, most of us don't.
p134
aVWe end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,
p135
aVwhere we see the people we already know
p136
aVand the people who are similar to the people we already know.
p137
aVAnd we tend not to see that wider picture.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow for me, I'm surprised by this,
p140
aVbecause this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.
p141
aVIf you go back into the early days of the internet,
p142
aVwhen cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte
p143
aVwere writing big books like "Being Digital,"
p144
aVthe prediction was that the internet
p145
aVwas going to be an incredibly powerful force
p146
aVto smooth out cultural differences,
p147
aVto put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.
p148
aVNegroponte started his book with a story
p149
aVabout how hard it is to build connections
p150
aVin the world of atoms.
p151
aVHe's at a technology conference in Florida.
p152
aVAnd he's looking at something really, truly absurd,
p153
aVwhich is bottles of Evian water on the table.
p154
aVAnd Negroponte says this is crazy.
p155
aVThis is the old economy.
p156
aVIt's the economy of moving these
p157
aVheavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.
p158
aVWe're heading to the future of bits,
p159
aVwhere everything is speedy, it's weightless.
p160
aVIt can be anywhere in the world at any time.
p161
aVAnd it's going to change the world as we know it.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.
p164
aVHe's totally wrong about this one.
p165
aVIt turns out that in many cases
p166
aVatoms are much more mobile than bits.
p167
aVIf I walk into a store in the United States,
p168
aVit's very, very easy for me to buy water
p169
aVthat's bottled in Fiji,
p170
aVshipped at great expense to the United States.
p171
aVIt's actually surprisingly hard
p172
aVfor me to see a Fijian feature film.
p173
aVIt's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.
p174
aVIt's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,
p175
aVwhich is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.
p176
aVThere's a coup government. There's a military government.
p177
aVThere's crackdowns on the press.
p178
aVIt's actually a place that we probably should
p179
aVbe paying attention to at the moment.
p180
aa(lp181
VHere's what I think is going on.
p182
aVI think that we tend to look a lot
p183
aVat the infrastructure
p184
aVof globalization.
p185
aVWe look at the framework that makes it possible
p186
aVto live in this connected world.
p187
aVAnd that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.
p188
aVIt includes things like the Internet cables.
p189
aVWe look at a map like this one,
p190
aVand it looks like the entire world is flat
p191
aVbecause everything is a hop or two away.
p192
aVYou can get on a flight in London,
p193
aVyou can end up in Bangalore later today.
p194
aVTwo hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.
p195
aVIt's all right there.
p196
aa(lp197
VWhen you start looking at what actually
p198
aVflows on top of these networks,
p199
aVyou get a very different picture.
p200
aVYou start looking at how
p201
aVthe global plane flights move,
p202
aVand you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.
p203
aVIt's extremely lumpy.
p204
aVThere are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.
p205
aVThere's basically a giant pathway in the sky
p206
aVbetween London and New York.
p207
aVbut look at this map, and you can watch this
p208
aVfor, you know, two or three minutes.
p209
aVYou won't see very many planes
p210
aVgo from South America to Africa.
p211
aVAnd you'll discover that there are parts of the globe
p212
aVthat are systematically cut off.
p213
aVWhen we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,
p214
aVand we look at what actually happens,
p215
aVwe start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way
p216
aVthat we think it does.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo here's the problem that I've been interested in
p219
aVin the last decade or so.
p220
aVThe world is, in fact, getting more global.
p221
aVIt's getting more connected.
p222
aVMore of problems are global in scale.
p223
aVMore of our economics is global in scale.
p224
aVAnd our media is less global by the day.
p225
aVIf you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,
p226
aV35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news
p227
aVon a nightly new broadcast.
p228
aVThat's down to about 12 to 15 percent.
p229
aVAnd this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.
p230
aVHere's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.
p231
aVAlisa's the president of Public Radio International.
p232
aVAnd she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map
p233
aVbased on what American
p234
aVtelevision news casts
p235
aVlooked at for a month.
p236
aVAnd you see that when you distort a map based on attention,
p237
aVthe world within American television news
p238
aVis basically reduced to
p239
aVthis giant bloated U.S.
p240
aVand a couple of other countries which we've invaded.
p241
aVAnd that's basically what our media is about.
p242
aVAnd before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news \u2014
p243
aVwhich is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful \u2014
p244
aVI've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,
p245
aVand I get the same thing.
p246
aVWhen you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,
p247
aVwhat you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations
p248
aVand the nations we've invaded.
p249
aa(lp250
VIt turns out that new media
p251
aVisn't necessarily helping us all that much.
p252
aVHere's a map made by Mark Graham
p253
aVwho's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.
p254
aVA this is a map of articles in Wikipedia
p255
aVthat have been geo-coded.
p256
aVAnd you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias
p257
aVtowards North America and Western Europe.
p258
aVEven within Wikipedias,
p259
aVwhere we're creating their own content online,
p260
aVthere's a heavy bias towards the place where
p261
aVa lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,
p262
aVrather than to the rest of the world.
p263
aVIn the U.K., you can get up,
p264
aVyou can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,
p265
aVyou could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,
p266
aVfrom Canada, God forbid from the U.S.
p267
aVYou probably won't.
p268
aVIf you look at online media consumption \u2014
p269
aVin this case, in the top 10 users of the internet \u2014
p270
aVmore than 95 percent of the news readership
p271
aVis on domestic news sites.
p272
aVIt's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],
p273
aVbecause we actually like reading your media,
p274
aVrather than vice versa.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo all of this starts leading me
p277
aVto think that we're in a state that I refer to
p278
aVas imaginary cosmopolitanism.
p279
aVWe look at the internet.
p280
aVWe think we're getting this wide view of the globe.
p281
aVWe occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,
p282
aVand we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built
p283
aVto connect us to the rest of the world.
p284
aVAnd we forget that most of the time
p285
aVwe're checking Boston Red Sox scores.
p286
aVSo this is a real problem \u2014
p287
aVnot just because the Red Sox are having a bad year \u2014
p288
aVbut it's a real problem because,
p289
aVas we're discussing here at TED,
p290
aVthe real problems in the world
p291
aVthe interesting problems to solve
p292
aVare global in scale and scope,
p293
aVthey require global conversations
p294
aVto get to global solutions.
p295
aVThis is a problem we have to solve.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo here's the good news.
p298
aVFor six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.
p299
aVThis is a group called Global Voices.
p300
aVThis is a team of bloggers from around the world.
p301
aVOur mission was to fix the world's media.
p302
aVWe started in 2004.
p303
aVYou might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.
p304
aVNor do I think we are by ourselves,
p305
aVactually going to solve the problem.
p306
aVBut the more that I think about it, the more that I think
p307
aVthat a few things that we have learned along the way
p308
aVare interesting lessons for how we would rewire
p309
aVif we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.
p310
aVThe first thing you have to consider
p311
aVis that there are parts of the world
p312
aVthat are dark spots in terms of attention.
p313
aVIn this case \u2014 the map of the world at night by NASA \u2014
p314
aVthey're dark literally because of lack of electricity.
p315
aVAnd I used to think that a dark spot on this map
p316
aVbasically meant you're not going to get media from there
p317
aVbecause there are more basic needs.
p318
aa(lp319
VWhat I'm starting to realize is that
p320
aVyou can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,
p321
aVand you need an enormous amount of encouragement.
p322
aVOne of those dark spots is Madagascar,
p323
aVa country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film
p324
aVthan it is actually known for
p325
aVthe lovely people who live there.
p326
aVAnd so the people who founded
p327
aVFoko Club in Madagascar
p328
aVweren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.
p329
aVThey were doing something much simpler.
p330
aVIt was a club to learn English
p331
aVand to learn computers and the internet.
p332
aVbut what happened was that Madagascar
p333
aVwent through a violent coup.
p334
aVMost independent media was shut down.
p335
aVAnd the high school students
p336
aVwho were learning to blog through Foko Club
p337
aVsuddenly found themselves talking to an international audience
p338
aVabout the demonstrations, the violence,
p339
aVeverything that was going on within this country.
p340
aVSo a very, very small program
p341
aVdesigned to get people in front of computers,
p342
aVpublishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,
p343
aVended up having a huge impact
p344
aVon what we know about this country.
p345
aa(lp346
VNow the trick with this is that I'm guessing
p347
aVmost people here don't speak Malagasy.
p348
aVI'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese \u2014
p349
aVwhich is sort of sad if you think about it,
p350
aVas it's now the most represented language on the internet.
p351
aVFortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.
p352
aVIf you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,
p353
aVyou notice this really cute box at the top,
p354
aVwhich automatically detects that the page is in Chinese
p355
aVand very quickly at a mouse click
p356
aVwill give you a translation of the page.
p357
aVUnfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.
p358
aVAnd while Google is very, very good with some languages,
p359
aVit's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.
p360
aVAnd the results can be pretty funny.
p361
aVWhat you really want \u2014 what I really want,
p362
aVis eventually the ability to push a button
p363
aVand have this queued
p364
aVso a human being can translate this.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd if you think this is absurd, it's not.
p367
aVThere's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.
p368
aVAnd Yeeyan is a group
p369
aVof 150,000 volunteers
p370
aVwho get online every day.
p371
aVThey look for the most interesting content in the English language.
p372
aVThey translate roughly 100 articles a day
p373
aVfrom major newspapers, major websites.
p374
aVThey put it online for free.
p375
aVIt's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,
p376
aVwho was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots
p377
aVand who couldn't believe how biased
p378
aVAmerican media coverage was.
p379
aVAnd he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,
p380
aVso that people between these countries
p381
aVstart understanding each other a little bit better."
p382
aVAnd my question to you is:
p383
aVif Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people
p384
aVto translate the English internet into Chinese,
p385
aVwhere's the English language Yeeyan?
p386
aVWho's going after Chinese,
p387
aVwhich now has 400 million internet users out there?
p388
aVMy guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,
p391
aVthere's no guarantee that we're going to find it.
p392
aVWhen we look for information online,
p393
aVwe basically have two strategies.
p394
aVWe use a lot of search.
p395
aVAnd search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.
p396
aVBut if what you're looking for is serendipity,
p397
aVif you want to stumble onto something
p398
aVthat you didn't know you needed,
p399
aVour main philosophy is to look to our social networks,
p400
aVto look for our friends.
p401
aVWhat are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.
p402
aVThe problem with this is that essentially
p403
aVwhat you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.
p404
aVYou end up flocking with a lot of people
p405
aVwho are probably similar to you,
p406
aVwho have similar interests.
p407
aVAnd it's very, very hard to get information
p408
aVfrom the other flocks, from the other parts of the world
p409
aVwhere people getting together and talking about their own interests.
p410
aVTo do this, at a certain point,
p411
aVyou need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.
p412
aVYou need a guide.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.
p415
aVShe has one of the hardest jobs in the world.
p416
aVNot only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors
p417
aVfrom killing each other,
p418
aVshe has to figure out
p419
aVwhat is going to interest you
p420
aVabout the Middle East.
p421
aVAnd in that sense of trying to get you
p422
aVout of your normal orbit,
p423
aVand to try to get you to pay attention
p424
aVto a story about someone who's
p425
aVgiven up smoking for the month of Ramadan,
p426
aVshe has to know something about a global audience.
p427
aVShe has to know something about what stories are available.
p428
aVBasically, she's a deejay.
p429
aVShe's a skilled human curator
p430
aVwho knows what material is available to her,
p431
aVwho's able to listen to the audience,
p432
aVand who's able to make a selection
p433
aVand push people forward in one fashion or another.
p434
aVI don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.
p435
aVI think what's great about the internet
p436
aVis that it actually makes it much easier
p437
aVfor deejays to reach a wider audience.
p438
aVI know Amira.
p439
aVI can ask her what to read.
p440
aVBut with the internet, she's in a position where she can
p441
aVtell a lot of people what to read.
p442
aVAnd you can listen to her as well,
p443
aVif this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.
p444
aa(lp445
VSo once you start widening like this,
p446
aVonce you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,
p447
aVonce you start translating, once you start curating,
p448
aVyou end up in some really weird places.
p449
aVThis is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,
p450
aVwhich is AfriGadget.
p451
aVAnd AfriGadget is a blog that looks
p452
aVat technology in an Africa context.
p453
aVAnd specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith
p454
aVin Kibera in Nairobi,
p455
aVwho is turning the shaft of a Landrover
p456
aVinto a cold chisel.
p457
aVAnd when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,
p458
aV"Why would I conceivably care about this?"
p459
aVAnd the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.
p460
aVThis is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.
p461
aVHe goes by the moniker White African.
p462
aVHe's both a very well known American geek,
p463
aVbut he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.
p464
aVHe is a bridge figure.
p465
aVHe is someone who literally has feet in both worlds \u2014
p466
aVone in the world of the African technology community,
p467
aVone in the world of the American technology community.
p468
aVAnd so he's able to tell a story
p469
aVabout this blacksmith in Kibera
p470
aVand turn it into a story about repurposing technology,
p471
aVabout innovating from constraint,
p472
aVabout looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.
p473
aVHe knows one world,
p474
aVand he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,
p475
aVboth of which he has deep connections to.
p476
aVThese bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,
p477
aVare the future of how we try to make the world wider
p478
aVthrough using the web.
p479
aa(lp480
VBut the trick with bridges is, ultimately,
p481
aVyou need someone to cross them.
p482
aVAnd that's where we start talking about xenophiles.
p483
aVSo if I found myself in the NFL,
p484
aVI suspect I would spend my off-season
p485
aVnursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth \u2014
p486
aVpossibly recording a hip-hop album.
p487
aVDhani Jones,
p488
aVwho is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,
p489
aVhas a slightly different approach to the off-season.
p490
aVDhani has a television show.
p491
aVIt's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
p492
aVAnd every week on this television show,
p493
aVDhani travels to a different nation of the world.
p494
aVHe finds a local sporting team.
p495
aVHe trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.
p496
aVAnd his reason for this
p497
aVis not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.
p498
aVIt's because, for him,
p499
aVsport is the language
p500
aVthat allows him to encounter
p501
aVthe full width and wonder of the world.
p502
aVFor some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.
p503
aVFor a lot of us it might be literature or writing.
p504
aVBut there are all these different techniques
p505
aVthat allow you to go out and look at the world
p506
aVand find your place within it.
p507
aa(lp508
VThe goal of my Talk here
p509
aVis not to persuade the people in this room
p510
aVto embrace your xenophilia.
p511
aVMy guess \u2014 given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal \u2014
p512
aVis that most of you are xenophiles,
p513
aVwhether or not you use that term.
p514
aVMy challenge instead is this.
p515
aVIt's not enough to make the personal decision
p516
aVthat you want a wider world.
p517
aVWe have to figure out how to rewire
p518
aVthe systems that we have.
p519
aVWe have to fix our media.
p520
aVWe have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.
p521
aVWe have to fix our immigration policy.
p522
aVWe need to look at ways
p523
aVof creating serendipity,
p524
aVof making translation pervasive,
p525
aVand we need to find ways to embrace
p526
aVand celebrate these bridge figures.
p527
aVAnd we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.
p528
aVThat's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.
