VPicture this:
p4
aVIt's Monday morning,
p5
aVyou're at the office,
p6
aVyou're settling in for the day at work,
p7
aVand this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall,
p8
aVwalks right into your cubicle
p9
aVand he steals your chair.
p10
aVDoesn't say a word \u2014
p11
aVjust rolls away with it.
p12
aVDoesn't give you any information about why he took your chair
p13
aVout of all the other chairs  that are out there.
p14
aVDoesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair
p15
aVto get some work done today.
p16
aVYou wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink.
p17
aVYou'd follow that guy back to his cubicle
p18
aVand you'd say, "Why my chair?"
p19
aa(lp20
VOkay, so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office,
p21
aVand a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall,
p24
aVand the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about.
p25
aVBut there's no agenda.
p26
aVThere's no information about why you were invited to the meeting.
p27
aVAnd yet you accept the  meeting invitation, and you go.
p28
aVAnd when this highly  unproductive session is over,
p29
aVyou go back to your desk,
p30
aVand you stand at your  desk and you say,
p31
aV"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,
p32
aVlike I wish I had my chair back."
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VEvery day, we allow our coworkers,
p36
aVwho are otherwise very,  very nice people,
p37
aVto steal from us.
p38
aVAnd I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture.
p39
aVI'm talking about time. Your time.
p40
aVIn fact, I believe that
p41
aVwe are in the middle of a global epidemic
p42
aVof a terrible new illness known as MAS:
p43
aVMindless Accept Syndrome.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVThe primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome
p46
aVis just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVIt's an involuntary reflex \u2014 ding,  click, bing \u2014 it's in your calendar,
p49
aV"Gotta go, I'm already late  for a meeting." (Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VMeetings are important, right?
p52
aVAnd collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise.
p53
aVAnd a well-run meeting can yield  really positive, actionable results.
p54
aVBut between globalization
p55
aVand pervasive information technology,
p56
aVthe way that we work
p57
aVhas really changed dramatically  over the last few years.
p58
aVAnd we're miserable. (Laughter)
p59
aVAnd we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting,
p60
aVit's because of MAS, our  Mindless Accept Syndrome,
p61
aVwhich is a self-inflicted wound.
p62
aa(lp63
VActually, I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic.
p64
aVLet me tell you why.
p65
aVA couple of years ago, I put a video  on Youtube, and in the video,
p66
aVI acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on.
p67
aVIt goes on for about five minutes,
p68
aVand it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings.
p69
aVThere's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting.
p70
aVThere are the participants who  have no idea why they're there.
p71
aVThe whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck.
p72
aVAnd everybody leaves very angry.
p73
aVIt's kind of funny.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVLet's take a quick look.
p76
aV(Video) Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal.
p77
aVAs a group, we need to decide if \u2014
p78
aVbloop bloop \u2014
p79
aVHi, who just joined?
p80
aVHi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVHi, Joe. Thanks for  joining us today, great.
p83
aVI was just saying, we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through,
p84
aVso let's skip the roll call
p85
aVand I'm gonna dive right in.
p86
aVOur goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal.
p87
aVAs a group, we need to decide if \u2014
p88
aVbloop bloop \u2014
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVHi, who just joined?
p91
aVNo? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VSound familiar?
p94
aVYeah, it sounds familiar  to me, too.
p95
aVA couple of weeks after I put that online,
p96
aV500,000 people in dozens of countries,
p97
aVI mean dozens of countries,
p98
aVwatched this video.
p99
aVAnd three years later, it's still getting  thousands of views every month.
p100
aVIt's close to about a million right now.
p101
aVAnd in fact, some of the biggest companies in the world,
p102
aVcompanies that you've  heard of but I won't name,
p103
aVhave asked for my permission to use  this video in their new-hire training
p104
aVto teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company.
p105
aVAnd if the numbers \u2014
p106
aVthere are a million views and it's being used by all these companies \u2014
p107
aVaren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings,
p108
aVthere are the many, many thousands
p109
aVof comments posted online
p110
aVafter the video went up.
p111
aVThousands of people wrote things like,
p112
aV"OMG, that was my day today!"
p113
aV"That was my day every day!"
p114
aV"This is my life."
p115
aVOne guy wrote,
p116
aV"It's funny because it's true.
p117
aVEerily, sadly, depressingly true.
p118
aVIt made me laugh until I cried.
p119
aVAnd cried. And I cried some more."
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVThis poor guy said,
p122
aV"My daily life until  retirement or death, sigh."
p123
aVThese are real quotes
p124
aVand it's real sad.
p125
aa(lp126
VA common theme running through all of these comments online
p127
aVis this fundamental belief  that we are powerless
p128
aVto do anything other  than go to meetings
p129
aVand suffer through these  poorly run meetings
p130
aVand live to meet another day.
p131
aVBut the truth is, we're  not powerless at all.
p132
aVIn fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.
p133
aVIt's right at our fingertips, literally.
p134
aVIt's something that I call ¡No MAS!
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVWhich, if I remember my  high school Spanish,
p137
aVmeans something like,  "Enough already, make it stop!"
p138
aa(lp139
VHere's how No MAS  works. It's very simple.
p140
aVFirst of all, the next time you  get a meeting invitation
p141
aVthat doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all,
p142
aVclick the tentative button!
p143
aVIt's okay, you're allowed,  that's why it's there.
p144
aVIt's right next to the accept button.
p145
aVOr the maybe button, or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately.
p146
aVThen, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting.
p147
aVTell them you're very excited  to support their work,
p148
aVask them what the goal  of the meeting is,
p149
aVand tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal.
p150
aVAnd if we do this often enough,
p151
aVand we do it respectfully,
p152
aVpeople might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful
p153
aVabout the way they put together meeting invitations.
p154
aVAnd you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it.
p155
aVPeople might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine!
p156
aVOr they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status
p157
aVwhen they could just do a quick email and get it done with.
p158
aVPeople just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours.
p159
aVAnd they just might bring your chair back, too. (Laughter)
p160
aVNo MAS!
p161
aVThank you.
p162
aV(Applause).
