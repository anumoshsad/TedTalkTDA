VFor the last year,
p4
aVeveryone's been watching the same show,
p5
aVand I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones,"
p6
aVbut a horrifying, real-life drama
p7
aVthat's proved too fascinating to turn off.
p8
aVIt's a show produced by murderers
p9
aVand shared around the world via the Internet.
p10
aVTheir names have become familiar:
p11
aVJames Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,
p12
aVHaruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.
p13
aa(lp14
VTheir beheadings by the Islamic State
p15
aVwere barbaric,
p16
aVbut if we think they were archaic,
p17
aVfrom a remote, obscure age,
p18
aVthen we're wrong.
p19
aVThey were uniquely modern,
p20
aVbecause the murderers acted knowing well
p21
aVthat millions of people would tune in to watch.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe headlines called them savages and barbarians,
p24
aVbecause the image of one man overpowering another,
p25
aVkilling him with a knife to the throat,
p26
aVconforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices,
p27
aVthe polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways.
p28
aVWe don't do things like that.
p29
aVBut that's the irony.
p30
aVWe think a beheading has nothing to do with us,
p31
aVeven as we click on the screen to watch.
p32
aVBut it is to do with us.
p33
aVThe Islamic State beheadings
p34
aVare not ancient or remote.
p35
aVThey're a global, 21st century event,
p36
aVa 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks,
p37
aVon our computer screens.
p38
aVThey're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us.
p39
aVAnd whether we like it or not,
p40
aVeveryone who watches is a part of the show.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd lots of people watch.
p43
aVWe don't know exactly how many.
p44
aVObviously, it's difficult to calculate.
p45
aVBut a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014,
p46
aVestimated that 1.2 million people
p47
aVhad watched the beheading of James Foley
p48
aVin the few days after it was released.
p49
aVAnd that's just the first few days,
p50
aVand just Britain.
p51
aVA similar poll taken in the United States
p52
aVin November 2014
p53
aVfound that nine percent of those surveyed
p54
aVhad watched beheading videos,
p55
aVand a further 23 percent
p56
aVhad watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown.
p57
aVNine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch,
p58
aVbut it's still a very large crowd.
p59
aVAnd of course that crowd is growing all the time,
p60
aVbecause every week, every month,
p61
aVmore people will keep downloading and keep watching.
p62
aa(lp63
VIf we go back 11 years,
p64
aVbefore sites like YouTube and Facebook were born,
p65
aVit was a similar story.
p66
aVWhen innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,
p67
aVNick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,
p68
aVthose videos were shown during the Iraq War.
p69
aa(lp70
VNick Berg's beheading
p71
aVquickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet.
p72
aVWithin a day, it was the top search term
p73
aVacross search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.
p74
aVIn the week after Nick Berg's beheading,
p75
aVthese were the top 10 search terms in the United States.
p76
aVThe Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week,
p77
aVand it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May,
p78
aVrunner-up only to "American Idol."
p79
aVThe al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading
p80
aVhad to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site.
p81
aVOne Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures
p82
aVrose from 300,000 to 750,000
p83
aVevery time a beheading in Iraq was shown.
p84
aVHe told reporters 18 months later
p85
aVthat it had been downloaded many millions of times,
p86
aVand that's just one website.
p87
aVA similar pattern was seen again and again
p88
aVwhen videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War.
p89
aa(lp90
VSocial media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before,
p91
aVbut if we take another step back in history,
p92
aVwe'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd
p93
aVin our history of beheadings as public spectacle.
p94
aVAs soon as the camera appeared on the scene,
p95
aVa full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,
p96
aVit had an immediate and unequivocal effect.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France.
p99
aVIt was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,
p100
aVoutside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
p101
aVWeidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn,
p102
aVas was customary at the time,
p103
aVbut his executioner was new to the job,
p104
aVand he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare.
p105
aVSo Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning,
p106
aVby which time on a June morning,
p107
aVthere was enough light to take photographs,
p108
aVand a spectator in the crowd filmed the event,
p109
aVunbeknownst to the authorities.
p110
aVSeveral still photographs were taken as well,
p111
aVand you can still watch the film online today
p112
aVand look at the photographs.
p113
aVThe crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution
p114
aVwas called "unruly" and "disgusting" by the press,
p115
aVbut that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people
p116
aVwho could now study the action
p117
aVover and over again,
p118
aVfreeze-framed in every detail.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before,
p121
aVbut it's not just about the camera.
p122
aVIf we take a bigger leap back in history,
p123
aVwe'll see that for as long as there have been
p124
aVpublic judicial executions and beheadings,
p125
aVthere have been the crowds to see them.
p126
aVIn London, as late as the early 19th century,
p127
aVthere might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging.
p128
aVThere could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed.
p129
aVAnd a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time,
p130
aVattracted even more.
p131
aa(lp132
VIn May 1820,
p133
aVfive men known as the Cato Street Conspirators
p134
aVwere executed in London for plotting
p135
aVto assassinate members of the British government.
p136
aVThey were hung and then decapitated.
p137
aVIt was a gruesome scene.
p138
aVEach man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd.
p139
aVAnd 100,000 people,
p140
aVthat's 10,000 more than can fit into Wembley Stadium,
p141
aVhad turned out to watch.
p142
aVThe streets were packed.
p143
aVPeople had rented out windows and rooftops.
p144
aVPeople had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street.
p145
aVPeople climbed lamp posts.
p146
aVPeople had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days.
p147
aa(lp148
VEvidence suggests that throughout our history
p149
aVof public beheadings and public executions,
p150
aVthe vast majority of the people who come to see
p151
aVare either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved.
p152
aVDisgust has been comparatively rare,
p153
aVand even when people are disgusted and are horrified,
p154
aVit doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.
p155
aa(lp156
VPerhaps the most striking example
p157
aVof the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved
p158
aVand even be disappointed
p159
aVwas the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine,
p160
aVthat famous decapitation machine.
p161
aVTo us in the 21st century,
p162
aVthe guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption,
p163
aVbut to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment.
p164
aVThey were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold,
p165
aVwhere people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly.
p166
aVTo them, watching the guillotine in action,
p167
aVit was so quick, there was nothing to see.
p168
aVThe blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately,
p169
aVand they called out,
p170
aV"Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows."
p171
aa(lp172
VThe end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America
p173
aVwas partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal,
p174
aVbut it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave
p175
aVin the way that they should.
p176
aVAll too often, execution day
p177
aVwas more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.
p178
aa(lp179
VToday, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable,
p180
aVbut there are other scenarios that should make us cautious
p181
aVabout thinking that things are different now
p182
aVand we don't behave like that anymore.
p183
aa(lp184
VTake, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.
p185
aVThis is when a crowd gathers
p186
aVto watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building
p187
aVin order to kill themselves,
p188
aVand people in the crowd shout and jeer,
p189
aV"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"
p190
aVThis is a well-recognized phenomenon.
p191
aVOne paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,
p192
aVthere was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.
p193
aVAnd there have been incidents reported in the press this year.
p194
aVThis was a very widely reported incident
p195
aVin Telford and Shropshire in March this year.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd when it happens today,
p198
aVpeople take photographs and they take videos on their phones
p199
aVand they post those videos online.
p200
aVWhen it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos,
p201
aVthe Internet has created a new kind of crowd.
p202
aVToday, the action takes place in a distant time and place,
p203
aVwhich gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening,
p204
aVa sense of separation.
p205
aVIt's nothing to do with me.
p206
aVIt's already happened.
p207
aVWe are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
p208
aVToday, we are all offered front row seats.
p209
aVWe can all watch in private, in our own time and space,
p210
aVand no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis sense of separation \u2014
p213
aVfrom other people, from the event itself \u2014
p214
aVseems to be key to understanding our ability to watch,
p215
aVand there are several ways
p216
aVin which the Internet creates a sense of detachment
p217
aVthat seems to erode individual moral responsibility.
p218
aVOur activities online are often contrasted with real life,
p219
aVas though the things we do online are somehow less real.
p220
aVWe feel less accountable for our actions
p221
aVwhen we interact online.
p222
aVThere's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility,
p223
aVso we feel less accountable for our behavior.
p224
aVThe Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently,
p225
aVthings that we would usually avoid in everyday life.
p226
aVToday, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.
p227
aVOr you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life
p228
aVor you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.
p229
aVAnd when the action is pre-recorded
p230
aVand takes place in a distant time and space,
p231
aVwatching seems like a passive activity.
p232
aVThere's nothing I can do about it now.
p233
aVIt's already happened.
p234
aa(lp235
VAll these things make it easier as an Internet user
p236
aVfor us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death,
p237
aVto push our personal boundaries,
p238
aVto test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut we're not passive when we watch.
p241
aVOn the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.
p242
aVWhen the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless,
p243
aVhe or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.
p244
aVUnlike a trophy head that's taken in battle,
p245
aVthat represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight,
p246
aVwhen a beheading is staged,
p247
aVwhen it's essentially a piece of theater,
p248
aVthe power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.
p249
aVIn other words, watching is very much part of the event.
p250
aVThe event no longer takes place in a single location
p251
aVat a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to.
p252
aVNow the event is stretched out in time and place,
p253
aVand everyone who watches plays their part.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe should stop watching,
p256
aVbut we know we won't.
p257
aVHistory tells us we won't,
p258
aVand the killers know it too.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VBruno Giussani: Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you.
p265
aVLet's move here. While they install for the next performance,
p266
aVI want to ask you the question that probably many here have,
p267
aVwhich is how did you get interested in this topic?
p268
aa(lp269
VFrances Larson: I used to work at a museum
p270
aVcalled the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,
p271
aVwhich was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America.
p272
aVPeople used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!"
p273
aVAnd at the time, I was working on the history
p274
aVof scientific collections of skulls.
p275
aVI was working on the cranial collections,
p276
aVand it just struck me as ironic
p277
aVthat here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture
p278
aVthat they were almost fantasizing about and creating
p279
aVwithout really understanding what they were seeing,
p280
aVand all the while these vast \u2014 I mean hundreds of thousands
p281
aVof skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States \u2014
p282
aVwere kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality.
p283
aVSo I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us."
p284
aVWe're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads.
p285
aVLet's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.
p286
aVBG: Thank you for sharing that.
p287
aa(lp288
VFL: Thank you.
