VI'm often asked,
p4
aV"What surprised you about the book?"
p5
aVAnd I say, "That I got to write it."
p6
aVI would have never imagined that.
p7
aVNot in my wildest dreams did I think \u2014
p8
aVI don't even consider myself to be an author.
p9
aVAnd I'm often asked,
p10
aV"Why do you think so many people have read this?
p11
aVThis thing's selling still about a million copies a month."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I think it's because spiritual emptiness
p14
aVis a universal disease.
p15
aVI think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go,
p16
aV"There's got to be more to life than this."
p17
aVGet up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV,
p18
aVgo to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,
p19
aVgo to parties on weekends.
p20
aVA lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living \u2014 that's just existing.
p21
aVJust existing.
p22
aVI really think that there's this inner desire.
p23
aVI do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident.
p24
aVYour parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.
p25
aVI think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.
p26
aVI don't think there are accidental kids.
p27
aVAnd I think you matter.
p28
aa(lp29
VI think you matter to God; I think you matter to history;
p30
aVI think you matter to this universe.
p31
aVAnd I think that the difference
p32
aVbetween what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living,
p33
aVand the significance level of living is:
p34
aVDo you figure out, "What on Earth am I here for?"
p35
aVI meet a lot of people who are very smart,
p36
aVand say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?"
p37
aVAnd I meet a lot of people who are very successful,
p38
aVwho say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?
p39
aVWhy do I feel like a fake?
p40
aVWhy do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?"
p41
aVI think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.
p42
aVI think it comes down to this issue of:
p43
aV"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?"
p44
aVThese are not religious issues.
p45
aVThey're human issues.
p46
aa(lp47
VI wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does,
p48
aVbecause it makes my life work a whole lot easier.
p49
aVAs a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.
p50
aVAnd I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life.
p51
aVReligion doesn't have a monopoly on that,
p52
aVbut there are plenty of religious kooks.
p53
aVThere are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.
p54
aVThere are people \u2014 a lady came up to me the other day,
p55
aVand she had a white piece of paper \u2014 Michael, you'll like this one \u2014
p56
aVand she said, "What do you see in it?"
p57
aVAnd I looked at it and I said, "Oh, I don't see anything."
p58
aVAnd she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left.
p59
aVI'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VGood for you.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhen the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years,
p66
aVI kind of had my little crisis.
p67
aVAnd that was: What is the purpose of this?
p68
aVBecause it brought in enormous amounts of money.
p69
aVWhen you write the best-selling book in the world,
p70
aVit's tons and tons of money.
p71
aVAnd it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.
p72
aVWhen I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.
p73
aVI started it with one other family in 1980.
p74
aVAnd I decided that I was never going to go on TV,
p75
aVbecause I didn't want to be a celebrity.
p76
aVI didn't want to be a, quote, "evangelist, televangelist" \u2014
p77
aVthat's not my thing.
p78
aVAnd all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.
p79
aVI don't think \u2014
p80
aVnow, this is a worldview,
p81
aVand I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.
p82
aa(lp83
VEverybody's betting their life on something.
p84
aVYou're betting your life on something,
p85
aVyou just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.
p86
aVSo, everybody's betting their life on something.
p87
aVAnd when I, you know, made a bet,
p88
aVI happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.
p89
aVAnd I believe in a pluralistic society,
p90
aVeverybody's betting on something.
p91
aVAnd when I started the church,
p92
aVyou know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
p93
aVAnd then when I wrote this book,
p94
aVand all of a sudden, it just took off,
p95
aVand I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?
p96
aVBecause as I started to say,
p97
aVI don't think you're given money or fame
p98
aVfor your own ego, ever.
p99
aVI just don't believe that.
p100
aVAnd when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is,
p101
aV"It's not about you,"
p102
aVthen, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history,
p103
aVyou've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me.
p104
aVThat's kind of a no-brainer.
p105
aVSo, what is it for?
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd I began to think about what I call the "stewardship of affluence"
p108
aVand the "stewardship of influence."
p109
aVSo I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship.
p110
aVThat if you are a leader in any area \u2014
p111
aVin business, in politics, in sports, in art,
p112
aVin academics, in any area \u2014
p113
aVyou don't own it.
p114
aVYou are a steward of it.
p115
aVFor instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.
p116
aVThis is not my planet.
p117
aVIt wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die,
p118
aVI'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.
p119
aa(lp120
VI was debating the other day on a talk show,
p121
aVand the guy was challenging me and he'd go,
p122
aV"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?"
p123
aVAnd I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe
p124
aVthat human beings are responsible
p125
aVto make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?
p126
aVDo you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?"
p127
aVAnd he said, "No."
p128
aVI said, "Oh, you don't?"
p129
aVI said, "Let me make this clear again:
p130
aVDo you believe that as human beings \u2014 I'm not talking about religion \u2014
p131
aVdo you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility
p132
aVto take care of this planet,
p133
aVand make it just a little bit better for the next generation?"
p134
aVAnd he said, "No. Not any more than any other species."
p135
aVWhen he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview.
p136
aVAnd he was saying,
p137
aV"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is."
p138
aVWell now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,
p139
aVbut you're not a duck.
p140
aVYou're not a duck.
p141
aVAnd you are responsible \u2014 that's my worldview.
p142
aVAnd so, you need to understand what your worldview is.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe problem is most people never really think it through.
p145
aVThey never really ...
p146
aVcodify it or qualify it or quantify it,
p147
aVand say, "This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe."
p148
aVI don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.
p149
aVBut you may, you may.
p150
aVYour worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,
p151
aVbecause it determines your decisions;
p152
aVit determines your relationships;
p153
aVit determines your level of confidence.
p154
aVIt determines, really, everything in your life.
p155
aVWhat we believe, obviously \u2014
p156
aVand you know this \u2014 determines our behavior,
p157
aVand our behavior determines what we become in life.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo all of this money started pouring in,
p160
aVand all of this fame started pouring in.
p161
aVAnd I'm going, what do I do with this?
p162
aVMy wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.
p163
aVWe said, "First, we're not going to use it on ourselves."
p164
aVI didn't go out and buy a bigger house.
p165
aVI don't own a guesthouse.
p166
aVI still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.
p167
aVWe just said, we're not going to use it on us.
p168
aVThe second thing was,
p169
aVI stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.
p170
aVThird thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me
p171
aVover the last 25 years, and I gave it back.
p172
aVAnd I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking
p173
aVthat I do what I do for money \u2014 I don't.
p174
aVIn fact, personally, I've never met
p175
aVa priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.
p176
aVI know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them.
p177
aVBelieve me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.
p178
aa(lp179
VPastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors.
p180
aVI left late today \u2014 I'd hoped to be here yesterday \u2014
p181
aVbecause my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours
p182
aVbefore he dies of cancer.
p183
aVAnd I'm watching a guy who's lived his life \u2014
p184
aVhe's now in his mid-80s \u2014 and he's dying with peace.
p185
aVYou know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times.
p186
aVThe test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.
p187
aVAnd having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,
p188
aVit makes a difference.
p189
aVIt makes a difference what you believe.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, we gave it all back,
p192
aVand then we set up three foundations,
p193
aVworking on some of the major problems of the world:
p194
aVilliteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases \u2014 particularly HIV/AIDS \u2014
p195
aVand set up these three foundations, and put the money into that.
p196
aVThe last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers."
p197
aVAnd that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago,
p198
aVwe started tithing.
p199
aVNow, that's a principle in the Bible
p200
aVthat says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,
p201
aVgive it away to help other people.
p202
aVSo, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.
p203
aVSo, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,
p204
aVsecond year we went to 12 percent,
p205
aVand the third year we went to 13 percent,
p206
aVand on and on and on.
p207
aVWhy did I do that?
p208
aVBecause every time I give,
p209
aVit breaks the grip of materialism in my life.
p210
aa(lp211
VMaterialism is all about getting \u2014 get, get, get, get all you can,
p212
aVcan all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.
p213
aVIt's all about more, having more.
p214
aVAnd we think that the good life is actually looking good \u2014
p215
aVthat's most important of all \u2014
p216
aVlooking good, feeling good and having the goods.
p217
aVBut that's not the good life.
p218
aVI meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.
p219
aVIf money actually made you happy,
p220
aVthen the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.
p221
aVAnd that I know, personally, I know, is not true.
p222
aVIt's just not true.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods,
p225
aVit's about being good and doing good.
p226
aVGiving your life away.
p227
aVSignificance in life doesn't come from status,
p228
aVbecause you can always find somebody who's got more than you.
p229
aVIt doesn't come from sex.
p230
aVIt doesn't come from salary.
p231
aVIt comes from serving.
p232
aVIt is in giving our lives away that we find meaning,
p233
aVwe find significance.
p234
aVThat's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.
p235
aVAnd so we began to give away,
p236
aVand now after 30 years,
p237
aVmy wife and I are reverse tithers \u2014 we give away 90 percent and live on 10.
p238
aVThat, actually, was the easy part.
p239
aVThe hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?
p240
aVBecause I started getting all kinds of invitations.
p241
aVI just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour
p242
aVon three different continents,
p243
aVand I won't go into that,
p244
aVbut it was an amazing thing.
p245
aVAnd I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety
p246
aVthat the book has brought?
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.
p249
aVThere's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72,
p250
aVand it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.
p251
aVWhen you read this prayer,
p252
aVit sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.
p253
aVHe says, "God, I want you to make me famous."
p254
aVThat's what he prays.
p255
aVHe said, "I want you to make me famous.
p256
aVI want you to spread the fame of my name through every land,
p257
aVI want you to give me power.
p258
aVI want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence."
p259
aVAnd it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make,
p260
aVif you were going to pray.
p261
aVUntil you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.
p262
aVAnd then he says, "So that the king ..." \u2014
p263
aVhe was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power \u2014
p264
aV"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan,
p265
aVsupport the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,
p266
aVassist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,
p267
aVthose in prison."
p268
aVBasically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd as I read that,
p271
aVI looked at it, and I thought, you know,
p272
aVwhat this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up
p273
aVfor those who have no influence.
p274
aVThe purpose of influence is not to build your ego.
p275
aVOr your net worth.
p276
aVAnd, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.
p277
aVYour value is not based on your valuables.
p278
aVIt's based on a whole different set of things.
p279
aVAnd so the purpose of influence is to speak up
p280
aVfor those who have no influence.
p281
aVAnd I had to admit:
p282
aVI can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.
p283
aVThey're not on my radar.
p284
aVI pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America \u2014
p285
aVa bunch of gated communities.
p286
aVI have a church full of CEOs and scientists.
p287
aVAnd I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.
p288
aVThey're just not in my pathway.
p289
aVNow, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
p290
aVSo I had to say, ok,
p291
aVI would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got
p292
aVto help those who don't have either of those.
p293
aa(lp294
VYou know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses,
p295
aVwhether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me.
p296
aVBut Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments,"
p297
aVMoses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him,
p298
aVand God says, "Moses, what's in your hand?"
p299
aVI think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked:
p300
aVWhat's in your hand?
p301
aVMoses says, "It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff."
p302
aVAnd God says, "Throw it down."
p303
aVAnd if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.
p304
aVAnd then God says, "Pick it up."
p305
aVAnd he picks it back up again,
p306
aVand it becomes a staff again.
p307
aVNow, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?
p308
aVOK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.
p309
aVNumber one, God never does a miracle to show off.
p310
aVIt's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"
p311
aVAnd, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.
p312
aVYou know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VOk? I just, this is why I love what Michael does,
p317
aVbecause it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.
p318
aVBut God \u2014 my God \u2014 doesn't show up on sprinkler images.
p319
aVHe's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do.
p320
aVBut he doesn't do miracles just to show off.
p321
aa(lp322
VSecond thing is, if God ever asks you a question,
p323
aVhe already knows the answer.
p324
aVObviously, if he's God, then that would mean
p325
aVthat when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his.
p326
aVSo he's going, "What's in your hand?"
p327
aVNow, what was in Moses' hand?
p328
aVWell, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.
p329
aa(lp330
VThis staff represented three things about Moses' life.
p331
aVFirst, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.
p332
aVIt's the symbol of his own occupation:
p333
aVI am a shepherd.
p334
aVIt's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.
p335
aVSecond, it's a symbol of not only his identity,
p336
aVit's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.
p337
aVIn those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
p338
aVYour assets are tied up in your flocks.
p339
aVSo it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.
p340
aVAnd the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.
p341
aVWhat do you do with a shepherd's staff?
p342
aVWell, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it,
p343
aVby hook or by crook.
p344
aVYou pull them or you poke them. One or the other.
p345
aVSo, he's saying,
p346
aV"You're going to lay down your identity.
p347
aVWhat's in your hand?
p348
aVYou've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence.
p349
aVWhat's in your hand?"
p350
aVAnd he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.
p351
aVI'll do some things you could never imagine possible."
p352
aVAnd if you've watched that movie, "Ten Commandments,"
p353
aVall of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.
p354
aa(lp355
VLast year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game.
p356
aVAnd so, I'm talking to the players,
p357
aVbecause most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams
p358
aVhave done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.
p359
aVAnd I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?
p360
aVSo, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball.
p361
aVAnd that basketball represents your identity, who you are:
p362
aVyou're an NBA player.
p363
aVIt represents your income:
p364
aVyou're making a lot of money off that little ball.
p365
aVAnd it represents your influence.
p366
aVAnd even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,
p367
aVyou're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life.
p368
aVAnd that gives you enormous influence.
p369
aVSo, what are you going to do with what you've been given?"
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd I guess that's the main reason I came up here today,
p372
aVto all of you very bright people at TED \u2014
p373
aVit is to say, "What's in your hand?"
p374
aVWhat do you have that you've been given?
p375
aVTalent, background, education,
p376
aVfreedom, networks, opportunities,
p377
aVwealth, ideas, creativity.
p378
aVWhat are you doing with what you've been given?
p379
aVThat, to me, is the primary question about life.
p380
aVThat, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.
p381
aVIn the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things,
p382
aVyou're "SHAPED" with \u2014 a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart,
p383
aVAbility, Personality and Experiences.
p384
aVThese things shape you.
p385
aVAnd if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life,
p386
aVyou need to look at your shape \u2014 "What am I wired to do?"
p387
aVWhy would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it?
p388
aVIf you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.
p389
aVIf you're wired to be an undersea explorer,
p390
aVyou'll be an undersea explorer.
p391
aVIf you're wired to make deals, you make deals.
p392
aVIf you're wired to paint, you paint.
