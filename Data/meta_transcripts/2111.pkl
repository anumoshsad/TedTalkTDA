VI know a man who soars above the city every night.
p4
aVIn his dreams, he twirls and swirls
p5
aVwith his toes kissing the Earth.
p6
aVEverything has motion, he claims,
p7
aVeven a body as paralyzed as his own.
p8
aVThis man is my father.
p9
aa(lp10
VThree years ago, when I found out
p11
aVthat my father had suffered a severe stroke
p12
aVin his brain stem,
p13
aVI walked into his room in the ICU
p14
aVat the Montreal Neurological Institute
p15
aVand found him lying deathly still,
p16
aVtethered to a breathing machine.
p17
aVParalysis had closed over his body slowly,
p18
aVbeginning in his toes, then legs,
p19
aVtorso, fingers and arms.
p20
aVIt made its way up his neck,
p21
aVcutting off his ability to breathe,
p22
aVand stopped just beneath the eyes.
p23
aVHe never lost consciousness.
p24
aVRather, he watched from within
p25
aVas his body shut down,
p26
aVlimb by limb,
p27
aVmuscle by muscle.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body,
p30
aa(lp31
Vand with a quivering voice and through tears,
p32
aVI began reciting the alphabet.
p33
aVA, B, C, D, E, F, G,
p34
aVH, I, J, K.
p35
aVAt K, he blinked his eyes.
p36
aVI began again.
p37
aVA, B, C, D, E, F, G,
p38
aVH, I.
p39
aVHe blinked again at the letter I,
p40
aVthen at T, then at R, and A:
p41
aVKitra.
p42
aVHe said "Kitra, my beauty, don't cry.
p43
aVThis is a blessing."
p44
aVThere was no audible voice, but my father
p45
aVcalled out my name powerfully.
p46
aVJust 72 hours after his stroke,
p47
aVhe had already embraced
p48
aVthe totality of his condition.
p49
aVDespite his extreme physical state,
p50
aVhe was completely present with me,
p51
aVguiding, nurturing,
p52
aVand being my father as much
p53
aVif not more than ever before.
p54
aa(lp55
VLocked-in syndrome
p56
aVis many people's worst nightmare.
p57
aVIn French, it's sometimes called
p58
aV"maladie de l'emmuré vivant."
p59
aVLiterally, "walled-in-alive disease."
p60
aVFor many people, perhaps most,
p61
aVparalysis is an unspeakable horror,
p62
aVbut my father's experience
p63
aVlosing every system of his body
p64
aVwas not an experience of feeling trapped,
p65
aVbut rather of turning the psyche inwards,
p66
aVdimming down the external chatter,
p67
aVfacing the recesses of his own mind,
p68
aVand in that place,
p69
aVfalling in love with life and body anew.
p70
aa(lp71
VAs a rabbi and spiritual man
p72
aVdangling between mind and body, life and death,
p73
aVthe paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.
p74
aVHe realized he no longer needed to look
p75
aVbeyond the corporeal world
p76
aVin order to find the divine.
p77
aV"Paradise is in this body.
p78
aVIt's in this world," he said.
p79
aa(lp80
VI slept by my father's side for the first four months,
p81
aVtending as much as I could
p82
aVto his every discomfort,
p83
aVunderstanding the deep  human psychological fear
p84
aVof not being able to call out for help.
p85
aVMy mother, sisters, brother and I,
p86
aVwe surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.
p87
aVWe became his mouthpiece,
p88
aVspending hours each day reciting the alphabet
p89
aVas he whispered back sermons
p90
aVand poetry with blinks of his eye.
p91
aVHis room, it became our temple of healing.
p92
aVHis bedside became a site for those
p93
aVseeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,
p94
aVmy father was able to speak
p95
aVand uplift,
p96
aVletter by letter,
p97
aVblink by blink.
p98
aVEverything in our world became slow and tender
p99
aVas the din, drama and death of the hospital ward
p100
aVfaded into the background.
p101
aVI want to read to you one of the first things
p102
aVthat we transcribed in the week following the stroke.
p103
aVHe composed a letter,
p104
aVaddressing his synagogue congregation,
p105
aVand ended it with the following lines:
p106
aV"When my nape exploded,
p107
aVI entered another dimension:
p108
aVinchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.
p109
aVUniverses are opened and closed continually.
p110
aVThere are many when low,
p111
aVwho stop growing.
p112
aVLast week, I was brought so low,
p113
aVbut I felt the hand of my father around me,
p114
aVand my father brought me back."
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen we weren't his voice,
p117
aVwe were his legs and arms.
p118
aVI moved them like I know I would have wanted
p119
aVmy own arms and legs to be moved
p120
aVwere they still for all the hours of the day.
p121
aVI remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,
p122
aVbending each joint to keep it soft and limber.
p123
aVI'd ask him again and again
p124
aVto visualize the motion,
p125
aVto watch from within as the finger curled
p126
aVand extended, and to move along with it
p127
aVin his mind.
p128
aa(lp129
VThen, one day, from the corner of my eye,
p130
aVI saw his body slither like a snake,
p131
aVan involuntary spasm passing through the course
p132
aVof his limbs.
p133
aVAt first, I thought it was my own hallucination,
p134
aVhaving spent so much time tending to this one body,
p135
aVso desperate to see anything react on its own.
p136
aVBut he told me he felt tingles,
p137
aVsparks of electricity flickering on and off
p138
aVjust beneath the surface of the skin.
p139
aVThe following week, he began ever so slightly
p140
aVto show muscle resistance.
p141
aVConnections were being made.
p142
aVBody was slowly and gently reawakening,
p143
aVlimb by limb, muscle by muscle,
p144
aVtwitch by twitch.
p145
aa(lp146
VAs a documentary photographer,
p147
aVI felt the need to photograph
p148
aVeach of his first movements
p149
aVlike a mother with her newborn.
p150
aVI photographed him taking his first unaided breath,
p151
aVthe celebratory moment after he showed
p152
aVmuscle resistance for the very first time,
p153
aVthe new adapted technologies that allowed him
p154
aVto gain more and more independence.
p155
aVI photographed the care and the love
p156
aVthat surrounded him.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut my photographs only told the outside story
p159
aVof a man lying in a hospital bed
p160
aVattached to a breathing machine.
p161
aVI wasn't able to portray his story from within,
p162
aVand so I began to search for a new visual language,
p163
aVone which strived to express the ephemeral quality
p164
aVof his spiritual experience.
p165
aa(lp166
VFinally, I want to share with you
p167
aVa video from a series that I've been working on
p168
aVthat tries to express the slow, in-between existence
p169
aVthat my father has experienced.
p170
aVAs he began to regain his ability to breathe,
p171
aVI started recording his thoughts,
p172
aVand so the voice that you hear in this video
p173
aVis his voice.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe
p176
aVyou're paralyzed
p177
aVto play the part
p178
aVof a quadriplegic.
p179
aVI don't.
p180
aVIn my mind,
p181
aVand in my dreams
p182
aVevery night
p183
aVI Chagall-man float
p184
aVover the city
p185
aVtwirl and swirl
p186
aVwith my toes kissing the floor.
p187
aVI know nothing about the statement
p188
aVof man without motion.
p189
aVEverything has motion.
p190
aVThe heart pumps.
p191
aVThe body heaves.
p192
aVThe mouth moves.
p193
aVWe never stagnate.
p194
aVLife triumphs up and down.
p195
aa(lp196
VKitra Cahana: For most of us,
p197
aVour muscles begin to twitch and move
p198
aVlong before we are conscious,
p199
aVbut my father tells me his privilege
p200
aVis living on the far periphery
p201
aVof the human experience.
p202
aVLike an astronaut who sees a perspective
p203
aVthat very few of us will ever get to share,
p204
aVhe wonders and watches as he takes
p205
aVhis first breaths
p206
aVand dreams about crawling back home.
p207
aVSo begins life at 57, he says.
p208
aVA toddler has no attitude in its being,
p209
aVbut a man insists on his world every day.
p210
aa(lp211
VFew of us will ever have to face physical limitations
p212
aVto the degree that my father has,
p213
aVbut we will all have moments of paralysis
p214
aVin our lives.
p215
aVI know I frequently confront walls
p216
aVthat feel completely unscalable,
p217
aVbut my father insists
p218
aVthat there are no dead ends.
p219
aVInstead, he invites me into his space of co-healing
p220
aVto give the very best of myself, and for him
p221
aVto give the very best of himself to me.
p222
aVParalysis was an opening for him.
p223
aVIt was an opportunity to emerge,
p224
aVto rekindle life force,
p225
aVto sit still long enough with himself
p226
aVso as to fall in love with the full continuum
p227
aVof creation.
p228
aa(lp229
VToday, my father is no longer locked in.
p230
aVHe moves his neck with ease,
p231
aVhas had his feeding peg removed,
p232
aVbreathes with his own lungs,
p233
aVspeaks slowly with his own quiet voice,
p234
aVand works every day
p235
aVto gain more movement in his paralyzed body.
p236
aVBut the work will never be finished.
p237
aVAs he says, "I'm living in a broken world,
p238
aVand there is holy work to do."
