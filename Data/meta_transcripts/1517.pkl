VSo the machine I'm going to talk you about
p4
aVis what I call the greatest machine that never was.
p5
aVIt was a machine that was never built,
p6
aVand yet, it will be built.
p7
aVIt was a machine that was designed
p8
aVlong before anyone thought about computers.
p9
aa(lp10
VIf you know anything about the history of computers,
p11
aVyou will know that in the '30s and the '40s,
p12
aVsimple computers were created
p13
aVthat started the computer revolution we have today,
p14
aVand you would be correct,
p15
aVexcept for you'd have the wrong century.
p16
aVThe first computer was really designed
p17
aVin the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
p18
aVIt was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,
p19
aVand the bits of it that were built are here
p20
aVin South Kensington.
p21
aa(lp22
VThat machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.
p23
aVNow, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage
p24
aVbecause his hair is always completely unkempt like this
p25
aVin every single picture. (Laughter)
p26
aVHe was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,
p27
aVpart of the aristocracy of Britain,
p28
aVand on a Saturday night in Marylebone,
p29
aVwere you part of the intelligentsia of that period,
p30
aVyou would have been invited round to his house
p31
aVfor a soiree \u2014 and he invited everybody:
p32
aVkings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people \u2014
p33
aVand he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.
p34
aa(lp35
VI really miss that era, you know, where you could
p36
aVgo around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer
p37
aVget demonstrated to you. (Laughter)
p38
aVBut Babbage, Babbage himself was born
p39
aVat the end of the 18th century,
p40
aVand was a fairly famous mathematician.
p41
aVHe held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,
p42
aVand that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
p43
aVHe's less well known than either of them because
p44
aVhe got this idea to make mechanical computing devices
p45
aVand never made any of them.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.
p48
aVEvery time he had a good idea, he'd think,
p49
aV"That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.
p50
aVI'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.
p51
aVI'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."
p52
aVHe did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,
p53
aVbasically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,
p54
aVand kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,
p55
aV"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VThe thing he designed was this monstrosity here,
p58
aVthe analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,
p59
aVthis is a view from above.
p60
aVEvery one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,
p61
aVand this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
p62
aVSo as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine
p63
aVthis gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds
p64
aVof what this thing would have sounded like.
p65
aVAnd I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine
p66
aV\u2014 that's why it's computer architecture \u2014
p67
aVand tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo let's talk about the memory. The memory
p70
aVis very like the memory of a computer today,
p71
aVexcept it was all made out of metal,
p72
aVstacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
p73
aVImagine a thing this high of cogs,
p74
aVhundreds and hundreds of them,
p75
aVand they've got numbers on them.
p76
aVIt's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
p77
aVAnd he thought about using binary. The problem
p78
aVwith using binary is that the machine would have been so
p79
aVtall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.
p80
aVSo he's got memory.
p81
aVThe memory is this bit over here.
p82
aVYou see it all like this.
p83
aa(lp84
VThis monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
p85
aVOf course, it's this big.
p86
aVCompletely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.
p87
aVThis is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU
p88
aVwhich is in the Science Museum.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic \u2014
p91
aVso addition, multiplication, subtraction, division \u2014
p92
aVwhich already is a bit of a feat in metal,
p93
aVbut it could also do something that a computer does
p94
aVand a calculator doesn't:
p95
aVthis machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
p96
aVIt could do the "if then" for basic programmers,
p97
aVand that fundamentally made it into a computer.
p98
aVIt could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,
p101
aVand we think about chips today, we can't
p102
aVlook inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.
p103
aVYet if you did, you would see something
p104
aVvery, very similar to this.
p105
aVThere's this incredible complexity in the CPU,
p106
aVand this incredible regularity in the memory.
p107
aVIf you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,
p108
aVyou'll see this. This all looks the same,
p109
aVthen there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
p110
aa(lp111
VAll this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,
p112
aVbut of course you need to program this thing, and of course,
p113
aVBabbage used the technology of the day
p114
aVand the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,
p115
aVwhich is punch cards. This thing over here
p116
aVis one of three punch card readers in here,
p117
aVand this is a program in the Science Museum, just
p118
aVnot far from here, created by Charles Babbage,
p119
aVthat is sitting there \u2014 you can go see it \u2014
p120
aVwaiting for the machine to be built.
p121
aVAnd there's not just one of these, there's many of them.
p122
aVHe prepared programs anticipating this would happen.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,
p125
aVin France, had created the Jacquard loom,
p126
aVwhich was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,
p127
aVso he was just repurposing the technology of the day,
p128
aVand like everything else he did, he's using the technology
p129
aVof his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,
p130
aVmechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year
p131
aVas Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,
p132
aVwho would completely revolutionize everything
p133
aVwith the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.
p134
aVBabbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,
p135
aVso steam and things.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, he needed accessories.
p138
aVObviously, you've got a computer now.
p139
aVYou've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
p140
aVYou need accessories you're going to come with.
p141
aVYou're not just going to have that,
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,
p144
aVso if anything went wrong \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p145
aVor the machine needed the attendant to come to it,
p146
aVthere was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)
p147
aVAnd there's actually an instruction on the punch card
p148
aVwhich says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"
p149
aVYou know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,
p150
aVthis thing, "Click, clack click click click,"
p151
aVsteam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VYou also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.
p154
aVThis is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for
p155
aVanother machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,
p156
aVwhich he never built, but which the Science Museum
p157
aVdid build in the '80s and '90s.
p158
aVIt's completely mechanical, again, a printer.
p159
aVIt prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,
p160
aVbut it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,
p161
aVso if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.
p162
aa(lp163
VYou also need graphics, right?
p164
aVI mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,
p165
aVso he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper
p166
aVand an ink pen and I'll make it plot."
p167
aVSo he designed a plotter as well,
p168
aVand, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much
p169
aVa pretty good machine.
p170
aa(lp171
VAlong comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.
p172
aVNow, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.
p173
aVThis lady is the daughter of the mad, bad
p174
aVand dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,
p175
aVand her mother, being a bit worried that she might have
p176
aVinherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,
p177
aVthought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.
p178
aVWe'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."
p179
aV(Laughter) Because of course,
p180
aVthere's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,
p181
aVso, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)
p182
aVEverything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,
p183
aVand she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,
p184
aVand Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
p185
aVThe Duke of Wellington is there, you know,
p186
aVget out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,
p187
aVand she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,
p188
aVwho said, "I understand what this does,
p189
aVand I understand the future of this machine."
p190
aVAnd we owe to her an enormous amount because we know
p191
aVa lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build
p192
aVbecause of her.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, some people call her the first programmer.
p195
aVThis is actually from one of \u2014 the paper that she translated.
p196
aVThis is a program written in a particular style.
p197
aVIt's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,
p198
aVand actually, she did something more amazing.
p199
aVRather than just being a programmer,
p200
aVshe saw something that Babbage didn't.
p201
aa(lp202
VBabbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
p203
aVHe was building a machine to do mathematics,
p204
aVand Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics
p205
aVon this machine." And just as you do,
p206
aVeveryone in this room already's got a computer on them
p207
aVright now, because they've got a phone.
p208
aVIf you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone
p209
aVor computer or any other computing device
p210
aVis mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
p211
aVWhether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,
p212
aVit's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,
p213
aVand Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing
p214
aVmathematical functions and symbols
p215
aVdoesn't mean these things can't represent
p216
aVother things in the real world, such as music."
p217
aVThis was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,
p218
aV"We could compute these amazing functions and print out
p219
aVtables of numbers and draw graphs," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p220
aVand Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,
p221
aVthis thing could even compose music if you
p222
aVtold it a representation of music numerically."
p223
aVSo this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.
p224
aVWhen you say she's a programmer, she did do some,
p225
aVbut the real thing is to have said the future is going to be
p226
aVmuch, much more than this.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,
p229
aVAlan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.
p230
aVNow, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.
p231
aVTuring's machine was entirely theoretical.
p232
aVBoth of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,
p233
aVbut Turing told us something very important.
p234
aVHe laid down the mathematical foundations
p235
aVfor computer science, and said,
p236
aV"It doesn't matter how you make a computer."
p237
aVIt doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,
p238
aVlike Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,
p239
aVor perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,
p240
aVmechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
p241
aVWe could go back to Babbage's machine
p242
aVand just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
p243
aVThere is in a sense a computing essence.
p244
aVThis is called the Church\u2013Turing thesis.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd so suddenly, you get this link where you say
p247
aVthis thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
p248
aVIn fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today
p249
aVwith computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)
p250
aVTo give you an idea of how slowly,
p251
aVit had about 1k of memory.
p252
aVIt used punch cards, which were being fed in,
p253
aVand it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
p254
aVIt did have a RAM pack.
p255
aVYou could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?
p258
aVSo there are plans.
p259
aVOver in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,
p260
aVthere are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages
p261
aVof notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
p262
aVOne of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,
p263
aVand that is also the name of a charity that I started
p264
aVwith Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing
p265
aVat the Science Museum, and also the person who drove
p266
aVthe project to build a difference engine,
p267
aVand our plan is to build it.
p268
aVHere in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe project has a number of parts to it.
p271
aVOne was the scanning of Babbage's archive.
p272
aVThat's been done. The second is now the study
p273
aVof all of those plans to determine what to build.
p274
aVThe third part is a computer simulation of that machine,
p275
aVand the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
p276
aa(lp277
VWhen it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,
p278
aVbecause rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,
p279
aVyou've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,
p280
aVI see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,
p281
aVI hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)
p282
aVBut in between that we're going to do a simulation.
p283
aa(lp284
VBabbage himself wrote, he said,
p285
aVas soon as the analytical engine exists,
p286
aVit will surely guide the future course of science.
p287
aVOf course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling
p288
aVwith new plans, but when it did get built, of course,
p289
aVin the 1940s, everything changed.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like
p292
aVin motion with a video which shows
p293
aVjust one part of the CPU mechanism working.
p294
aVSo this is just three sets of cogs,
p295
aVand it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism
p296
aVin action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo, give me five years.
p299
aVBefore the 2030s happen, we'll have it.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you very much. (Applause)
