VIn the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,
p4
aV"People protect what they love,"
p5
aVI want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,
p6
aVand that's the incredible number and variety
p7
aVof animals in it that make light.
p8
aa(lp9
VMy addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;
p10
aVthat's not an acronym \u2014 just somebody thought it looked like the insect.
p11
aVIt was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry
p12
aVfor diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
p13
aVRight after I completed my Ph.D.,
p14
aVI was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists
p15
aVthat was using it for the first time
p16
aVas a tool for ocean exploration.
p17
aVWe trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,
p18
aVand then my first open ocean dive
p19
aVwas in Santa Barbara Channel.
p20
aVIt was an evening dive.
p21
aVI went down to a depth of 880 feet
p22
aVand turned out the lights.
p23
aVAnd the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see
p24
aVthis phenomenon of animals making light
p25
aVcalled bioluminescence.
p26
aVBut I was totally unprepared
p27
aVfor how much there was
p28
aVand how spectacular it was.
p29
aVI saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores
p30
aVthat were longer than this room,
p31
aVpumping out so much light
p32
aVthat I could read the dials and gauges
p33
aVinside the suit without a flashlight;
p34
aVand puffs and billows
p35
aVof what looked like luminous blue smoke;
p36
aVand explosions of sparks
p37
aVthat would swirl up out of the thrusters \u2014
p38
aVjust like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,
p39
aVbut these were icy, blue embers.
p40
aVIt was breathtaking.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,
p43
aVit's these guys; it's fireflies.
p44
aVAnd there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light \u2014
p45
aVsome insects, earthworms, fungi \u2014
p46
aVbut in general, on land, it's really rare.
p47
aVIn the ocean, it's the rule
p48
aVrather than the exception.
p49
aVIf I go out in the open ocean environment,
p50
aVvirtually anywhere in the world,
p51
aVand I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,
p52
aVmost of the animals \u2014
p53
aVin fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent
p54
aVof the animals that I bring up in that net \u2014
p55
aVmake light.
p56
aVThis makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow I want to share with you a little video
p59
aVthat I shot from a submersible.
p60
aVI first developed this technique working from a little
p61
aVsingle-person submersible called Deep Rover
p62
aVand then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,
p63
aVwhich you see here.
p64
aVSo, mounted in front of the observation sphere,
p65
aVthere's a a three-foot diameter hoop
p66
aVwith a screen stretched across it.
p67
aVAnd inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera
p68
aVthat's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,
p69
aValbeit a little fuzzy.
p70
aVSo you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
p71
aVThat sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,
p72
aVthat's just electronic noise
p73
aVon these super intensified cameras.
p74
aVYou don't see luminescence until the submersible
p75
aVbegins to move forward through the water,
p76
aVbut as it does, animals bumping into the screen
p77
aVare stimulated to bioluminesce.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, when I was first doing this,
p80
aVall I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.
p81
aVI knew my forward speed, I knew the area,
p82
aVand so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources
p83
aVthere were per cubic meter.
p84
aVBut I started to realize that I could actually identify animals
p85
aVby the type of flashes they produced.
p86
aVAnd so, here, in the Gulf of Maine
p87
aVat 740 feet,
p88
aVI can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.
p89
aVLike those big explosions, sparks,
p90
aVare from a little comb jelly,
p91
aVand there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,
p92
aVand jellyfish.
p93
aVThere was another one of those comb jellies.
p94
aVAnd so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers
p95
aVto develop automatic recognition systems
p96
aVthat can identify these animals
p97
aVand then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.
p98
aVAnd we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,
p99
aVand do nearest neighbor distances.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean
p102
aVto see a light show like this.
p103
aVYou can actually see it in surface waters.
p104
aVThis is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,
p105
aVof a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.
p106
aVAnd this isn't someplace exotic
p107
aVlike one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,
p108
aVthis was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.
p109
aVAnd sometimes you can see it even closer than that,
p110
aVbecause the heads on ships \u2014
p111
aVthat's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening \u2014
p112
aVare flushed with unfiltered seawater
p113
aVthat often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
p114
aVSo, if you stagger into the head late at night
p115
aVand you're so toilet-hugging sick
p116
aVthat you forget to turn on the light,
p117
aVyou may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, how does a living creature make light?
p120
aVWell, that was the question that 19th century
p121
aVFrench physiologist Raphael Dubois,
p122
aVasked about this bioluminescent clam.
p123
aVHe ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;
p124
aVone, the enzyme, he called luciferase;
p125
aVthe substrate, he called luciferin
p126
aVafter Lucifer the Lightbearer.
p127
aVThat terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals
p128
aVbecause these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.
p129
aVIn fact, most of the people
p130
aVstudying bioluminescence today
p131
aVare focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals
p132
aVhave proved so incredibly valuable
p133
aVfor developing antibacterial agents,
p134
aVcancer fighting drugs,
p135
aVtesting for the presence of life on Mars,
p136
aVdetecting pollutants in our waters \u2014
p137
aVwhich is how we use it at ORCA.
p138
aVIn 2008,
p139
aVthe Nobel Prize in Chemistry
p140
aVwas awarded for work done
p141
aVon a molecule called green fluorescent protein
p142
aVthat was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry
p143
aVof a jellyfish,
p144
aVand it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,
p145
aVin terms of the impact that it has had
p146
aVon cell biology and genetic engineering.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnother thing all these molecules are telling us
p149
aVthat, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved
p150
aVat least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times
p151
aVin evolutionary history,
p152
aVwhich is a clear indication
p153
aVof how spectacularly important
p154
aVthis trait is for survival.
p155
aVSo, what is it about bioluminescence
p156
aVthat's so important to so many animals?
p157
aVWell, for animals that are trying to avoid predators
p158
aVby staying in the darkness,
p159
aVlight can still be very useful
p160
aVfor the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:
p161
aVand that's find food,
p162
aVattract a mate and avoid being eaten.
p163
aVSo, for example, this fish
p164
aVhas a built-in headlight behind its eye
p165
aVthat it can use for finding food
p166
aVor attracting a mate.
p167
aVAnd then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head
p168
aVjust like the headlights on your Lamborghini.
p169
aVThis fish actually has high beams.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd this fish, which is one of my favorites,
p172
aVhas three headlights on each side of its head.
p173
aVNow, this one is blue,
p174
aVand that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean
p175
aVbecause evolution has selected
p176
aVfor the color that travels farthest through seawater
p177
aVin order to optimize communication.
p178
aVSo, most animals make blue light,
p179
aVand most animals can only see blue light,
p180
aVbut this fish is a really fascinating exception
p181
aVbecause it has two red light organs.
p182
aVAnd I have no idea why there's two,
p183
aVand that's something I want to solve some day \u2014
p184
aVbut not only can it see blue light,
p185
aVbut it can see red light.
p186
aVSo it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope
p187
aVto be able to sneak up on animals
p188
aVthat are blind to red light
p189
aVand be able to see them without being seen.
p190
aVIt's also got a little chin barbel here
p191
aVwith a blue luminescent lure on it
p192
aVthat it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
p193
aVAnd a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis is another one of my favorite fish.
p196
aVThis is a viperfish, and it's got a lure
p197
aVon the end of a long fishing rod
p198
aVthat it arches in front of the toothy jaw
p199
aVthat gives the viperfish its name.
p200
aVThe teeth on this fish are so long
p201
aVthat if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,
p202
aVit would actually impale its own brain.
p203
aVSo instead, it slides in grooves
p204
aVon the outside of the head.
p205
aVThis is a Christmas tree of a fish;
p206
aVeverything on this fish lights up,
p207
aVit's not just that lure.
p208
aVIt's got a built-in flashlight.
p209
aVIt's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly
p210
aVthat it uses for a type of camouflage
p211
aVthat obliterates its shadow,
p212
aVso when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,
p213
aVit makes itself disappear.
p214
aVIt's got light organs in the mouth,
p215
aVit's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,
p216
aVin a mucus layer on the back and the belly,
p217
aVall used for different things \u2014
p218
aVsome of which we know about, some of which we don't.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,
p221
aVand I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing
p222
aVmy favorite topic with so many people.
p223
aVI do wish, with their budget,
p224
aVthat they might have spent just a tiny bit more money
p225
aVto pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,
p226
aVwho could have told them that those are the eyes
p227
aVof a fish that's been preserved in formalin.
p228
aVThese are the eyes of a living anglerfish.
p229
aVSo, she's got a lure that she sticks out
p230
aVin front of this living mousetrap
p231
aVof needle-sharp teeth
p232
aVin order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
p233
aVAnd this one has a lure
p234
aVwith all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow we used to think that the different shape of the lure
p237
aVwas to attract different types of prey,
p238
aVbut then stomach content analyses on these fish
p239
aVdone by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,
p240
aVhave revealed that
p241
aVthey all eat pretty much the same thing.
p242
aVSo, now we believe that the different shape of the lure
p243
aVis how the male recognizes the female
p244
aVin the anglerfish world,
p245
aVbecause many of these males
p246
aVare what are known as dwarf males.
p247
aVThis little guy
p248
aVhas no visible means of self-support.
p249
aVHe has no lure for attracting food
p250
aVand no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
p251
aVHis only hope for existence on this planet
p252
aVis as a gigolo. (Laughter)
p253
aVHe's got to find himself a babe
p254
aVand then he's got to latch on for life.
p255
aVSo this little guy
p256
aVhas found himself this babe,
p257
aVand you will note that he's had the good sense
p258
aVto attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVBut he still knows a good thing when he sees it,
p261
aVand so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.
p262
aVHis flesh fuses with her flesh,
p263
aVher bloodstream grows into his body,
p264
aVand he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVWell, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.
p267
aVShe always knows where he is,
p268
aVand she doesn't have to be monogamous,
p269
aVbecause some of these females
p270
aVcome up with multiple males attached.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.
p273
aVThey use it a lot for defense, many different ways.
p274
aVA lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water
p275
aVjust the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
p276
aVThis shrimp is actually
p277
aVspewing light out of its mouth
p278
aVlike a fire breathing dragon
p279
aVin order to blind or distract this viperfish
p280
aVso that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.
p281
aVAnd there are a lot of different animals that can do this:
p282
aVThere's jellyfish, there's squid,
p283
aVthere's a whole lot of different crustaceans,
p284
aa(lp285
Vthere's even fish that can do this.
p286
aVThis fish is called the shining tubeshoulder
p287
aVbecause it actually has a tube on its shoulder
p288
aVthat can squirt out light.
p289
aVAnd I was luck enough to capture one of these
p290
aVwhen we were on a trawling expedition
p291
aVoff the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"
p292
aVfor the deep portion of "Blue Planet."
p293
aVAnd we were using a special trawling net
p294
aVthat we were able to bring these animals up alive.
p295
aVSo we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.
p296
aVSo I'm holding it,
p297
aVand I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,
p298
aVand when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.
p299
aVBut to me, what's shocking
p300
aVis not just the amount of light,
p301
aVbut the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
p302
aVFor this fish, it's actually whole cells
p303
aVwith nuclei and membranes.
p304
aVIt's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,
p305
aVand we have no idea why it does it \u2014
p306
aVanother one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, another form of defense
p309
aVis something called a burglar alarm \u2014
p310
aVsame reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;
p311
aVthe honking horn and flashing lights
p312
aVare meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,
p313
aVthe police that will come and take the burglar away \u2014
p314
aVwhen an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,
p315
aVits only hope for escape may be
p316
aVto attract the attention of something bigger and nastier
p317
aVthat will attack their attacker,
p318
aVthereby affording them a chance for escape.
p319
aVThis jellyfish, for example, has
p320
aVa spectacular bioluminescent display.
p321
aVThis is us chasing it in the submersible.
p322
aVThat's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.
p323
aVWe capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible
p324
aVthat allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,
p325
aVbring it into the lab on the ship.
p326
aVAnd then to generate the display you're about to see,
p327
aVall I did was touch it once per second
p328
aVon its nerve ring with a sharp pick
p329
aVthat's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.
p330
aVAnd once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.
p331
aVThis is an unbelievable light show.
p332
aVIt's this pinwheel of light,
p333
aVand I've done calculations that show that this could be seen
p334
aVfrom as much as 300 feet away by a predator.
p335
aVAnd I thought, "You know,
p336
aVthat might actually make a pretty good lure."
p337
aVBecause one of the things that's frustrated me
p338
aVas a deep-sea explorer
p339
aVis how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about
p340
aVbecause of the way we explore the ocean.
p341
aa(lp342
VThe primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean
p343
aVis we go out and drag nets behind ships.
p344
aVAnd I defy you to name any other branch of science
p345
aVthat still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.
p346
aVThe other primary way is we go down
p347
aVwith submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.
p348
aVI've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.
p349
aVWhen I'm sitting in a submersible though,
p350
aVI know that I'm not unobtrusive at all \u2014
p351
aVI've got bright lights and noisy thrusters \u2014
p352
aVany animal with any sense is going to be long gone.
p353
aVSo, I've wanted for a long time
p354
aVto figure out a different way to explore.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.
p357
aVIt's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.
p358
aVAnd scientists have done this on land for years;
p359
aVwe just use a color that the animals can't see
p360
aVand then a camera that can see that color.
p361
aVYou can't use infrared in the sea.
p362
aVWe use far-red light, but even that's a problem
p363
aVbecause it gets absorbed so quickly.
p364
aVMade an intensified camera,
p365
aVwanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
p366
aVThing is, in science,
p367
aVyou basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover
p368
aVbefore they'll give you the money.
p369
aVAnd I didn't know what I was going to discover,
p370
aVso I couldn't get the funding for this.
p371
aVSo I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic
p372
aVto actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,
p373
aVand then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.
p374
aa(lp375
VMonterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
p376
aVgave me time with their ROV
p377
aVso that I could test it and we could figure out,
p378
aVyou know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use
p379
aVso that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us \u2014
p380
aVget the electronic jellyfish working.
p381
aVAnd you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,
p382
aVbecause we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy
p383
aVand you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,
p384
aVthe word Ziploc is still visible.
p385
aVNeedless to say, when it's kluged together like this,
p386
aVthere were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.
p387
aVBut there came a moment when it all came together,
p388
aVand everything worked.
p389
aVAnd, remarkably, that moment got caught on film
p390
aVby photographer Mark Richards,
p391
aVwho happened to be there at the precise moment
p392
aVthat we discovered that it all came together.
p393
aVThat's me on the left,
p394
aVmy graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,
p395
aVand Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.
p396
aVAnd we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor
p397
aVwith the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)
p398
aVAnd we were very, very happy.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo now we had a system
p401
aVthat we could actually take to some place
p402
aVthat was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean
p403
aVthat might be patrolled by large predators.
p404
aVAnd so, the place that we took it to
p405
aVwas this place called a Brine Pool,
p406
aVwhich is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
p407
aVIt's a magical place.
p408
aVAnd I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you \u2014
p409
aVwe had a crummy camera at the time \u2014
p410
aVbut I was ecstatic.
p411
aVWe're at the edge of the Brine Pool,
p412
aVthere's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.
p413
aVIt's clearly undisturbed by us.
p414
aVAnd I had my window into the deep sea.
p415
aVI, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there
p416
aVwhen we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.
p417
aVFour hours into the deployment,
p418
aVwe had programmed the electronic jellyfish
p419
aVto come on for the first time.
p420
aVEighty-six seconds after
p421
aVit went into its pinwheel display,
p422
aVwe recorded this:
p423
aVThis is a squid, over six feet long,
p424
aVthat is so new to science,
p425
aVit cannot be placed in any known scientific family.
p426
aVI could not have asked for a better proof of concept.
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation
p429
aVand said, "This is what we will discover."
p430
aVAnd they gave me enough money to do it right,
p431
aVwhich has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam \u2014
p432
aVwhich has been installed in
p433
aVthe Monterey Canyon for the past year \u2014
p434
aVand now, more recently,
p435
aVa modular form of this system,
p436
aVa much more mobile form
p437
aVthat's a lot easier to launch and recover,
p438
