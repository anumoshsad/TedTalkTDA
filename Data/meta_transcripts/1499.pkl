VIn the ocean,
p4
aVwhat is the common point
p5
aVbetween oil, plastic and radioactivity?
p6
aa(lp7
VOn the top line, this is the BP oil spill:
p8
aVbillions of barrels of oil gushing
p9
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p10
aVThe middle line is millions of tons of
p11
aVplastic debris accumulating in our ocean,
p12
aVand the third line is radioactive material
p13
aVleaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant
p14
aVin the Pacific Ocean.
p15
aa(lp16
VWell, the three big problems have in common
p17
aVthat they are man-made problems
p18
aVbut they are controlled by natural forces.
p19
aVThis should make us feel very, terribly awful
p20
aVas much as it should make us feel hopeful,
p21
aVbecause if we have the power to create these problems,
p22
aVwe may as well have the power
p23
aVto remediate these problems.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut what about natural forces?
p26
aVWell, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,
p27
aVis how we can use these natural forces
p28
aVto remediate these man-made problems.
p29
aVWhen the BP oil spill happened,
p30
aa(lp31
VI was working at MIT, and I was in charge
p32
aVof developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.
p33
aVAnd I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico
p34
aVand meet some fishermen and see
p35
aVthe terrible conditions in which they were working.
p36
aVMore than 700 of these boats,
p37
aVwhich are fishermen boats repurposed
p38
aVwith oil absorbent in white
p39
aVand oil containment in orange, were used,
p40
aVbut they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,
p41
aVand the health of the cleaners
p42
aVwere very deeply affected.
p43
aa(lp44
VI was working on a very interesting technology
p45
aVat MIT, but it was a very long-term view
p46
aVof how to develop technology,
p47
aVand it was going to be a very expensive technology,
p48
aVand also it would be patented.
p49
aVSo I wanted to develop something that we could
p50
aVdevelop very fast, that would be cheap,
p51
aVand that would be open-source, so, because
p52
aVoil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,
p53
aVand that would be using renewable energy.
p54
aVSo I quit my dream job,
p55
aVand I moved to New Orleans,
p56
aVand I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.
p57
aa(lp58
VCurrently, what they were doing is
p59
aVthat they were using these small fishing boats,
p60
aVand they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.
p61
aVIf you're using the exact same amount of surface
p62
aVof oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention
p63
aVto natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,
p64
aVyou can collect a lot more material.
p65
aVIf you're multiplying the rig,
p66
aVso you multiply how many layers of absorbent
p67
aVyou're using, you can collect a lot more.
p68
aVBut it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent
p69
aVagainst the winds, the surface currents and the waves.
p70
aVThese are enormous forces.
p71
aVSo the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique
p72
aVof sailing and tacking of the wind
p73
aVto capture or intercept the oil
p74
aVthat is drifting down the wind.
p75
aVSo this didn't require any invention.
p76
aVWe just took a simple sailing boat
p77
aVand we tried to pull something long and heavy,
p78
aVbut as we tacked back and forth,
p79
aVwhat we lost was two things:
p80
aVwe were losing pulling power and direction.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder
p83
aVfrom the back of the boat to the front,
p84
aVwould we have better control?
p85
aVSo I built this small sailing robot
p86
aVwith the rudder at the front,
p87
aVand I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,
p88
aVso that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,
p89
aVand I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,
p90
aVI could control four meters of absorbent.
p91
aVThen I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,
p92
aVand so you see the robot has
p93
aVa front rudder here.
p94
aVNormally it's at the back.
p95
aVAnd, playing, I realized that the maneuverability
p96
aVof this was really amazing,
p97
aVand I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,
p98
aVmore maneuverable than a normal boat.
p99
aa(lp100
VThen I started publishing online, and
p101
aVsome friends from Korea, they started being
p102
aVinterested in this, and we made a boat
p103
aVwhich has a front rudder and a back rudder,
p104
aVso we started interacting with this,
p105
aVand it was slightly better,
p106
aValthough it was very small and a bit off balance,
p107
aVbut then we thought,
p108
aVwhat if we have more than two points of control?
p109
aVWhat if the entire boat becomes a point of control?
p110
aVWhat if the entire boat changes shape?
p111
aa(lp112
VSo \u2014 (Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd so that's the beginning of Protei,
p117
aVand that's the first boat in history
p118
aVthat completely changed the shape of the hull
p119
aVin order to control it,
p120
aVand the properties of sailing that we get
p121
aVare very superior compared to a normal boat.
p122
aVWhen we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,
p123
aVand the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.
p124
aVThis is low speed, low wind speed,
p125
aVand the maneuverability is very increased,
p126
aVand here I'm going to do a small jibe,
p127
aVand look at the position of the sail.
p128
aVWhat's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,
p129
aVthe position of the front sail and the main sail
p130
aVare different to the wind.
p131
aVWe're catching wind from both sides.
p132
aVAnd this is exactly what we're looking [for]
p133
aVif we want to pull something long and heavy.
p134
aVWe don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.
p135
aVSo, I wanted to know if this was possible
p136
aVto put this at an industrial level,
p137
aVso we made a large boat with a large sail,
p138
aVand with a very light hull, inflatable,
p139
aVvery small footprint,
p140
aVso we have a very big size and power ratio.
p141
aa(lp142
VAfter this, we wanted to see if we could
p143
aVimplement this and automate the system,
p144
aVso we used the same system but we added
p145
aVa structure to it so we could activate the machine.
p146
aVSo, we used the same bladder-inflated system,
p147
aVand we took it for testing.
p148
aVSo this is happening in the Netherlands.
p149
aVWe tried in the water without any skin or ballast
p150
aVjust to see how it works.
p151
aVAnd then we mounted a camera for controlling it,
p152
aVbut quickly we saw that we would need
p153
aVa lot more weight at the bottom,
p154
aVso we had to take it back to the lab,
p155
aVand then we built a skin around it,
p156
aVwe put batteries, remote controllers, and then
p157
aVwe put it in the water and then we
p158
aVlet it go in the water and see how well it would work,
p159
aVso let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,
p160
aVand it worked okay, but we still have a long way.
p161
aVOur small prototype has given us good insight
p162
aVthat it's working very well,
p163
aVbut we still need to work a lot more on this.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo what we are doing is an accelerated evolution
p166
aVof sailing technology.
p167
aVWe went from a back rudder to a front rudder
p168
aVto two rudders to multiple rudders
p169
aVto the whole boat changing shape,
p170
aVand the more we are moving forward,
p171
aVand the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VBut I wanted to show you a fish because \u2014
p174
aVIn fact, it's very different from a fish.
p175
aVA fish will move because \u2014 by changing like this,
p176
aVbut our boat is propelled by the wind still,
p177
aVand the hull controls the trajectory.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage
p180
aVProtei Number Eight. It's not the last one,
p181
aVbut it's a good one for making demos.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo the first thing as I show you in the video is
p184
aVthat we may be able to control the trajectory
p185
aVof a sailing boat better,
p186
aVor we may be able to never be in irons,
p187
aVso never facing the wind,
p188
aVwe always can catch the wind from both sides.
p189
aVBut new properties of a sailing boat.
p190
aVSo if you're looking at the boat from this side,
p191
aVthis might remind you of an airplane profile.
p192
aVAn airplane, when you're moving in this direction,
p193
aVstarts to lift, and that's how it takes off.
p194
aVNow, if you're taking the same system,
p195
aVand you're putting vertical, you're bending,
p196
aVand if you're moving this way forward,
p197
aVyour instinct will tell you that you might go this way,
p198
aVbut if you're moving fast enough,
p199
aVyou might create what we call lateral lift,
p200
aVso we could get further or closer to the wind.
p201
aa(lp202
VOther property is this:
p203
aVA normal sailing boat has a centerboard here
p204
aVand a rudder at the back,
p205
aVand these two things are what creates most
p206
aVresistance and turbulence behind the boat,
p207
aVbut because this doesn't have either
p208
aVa centerboard or a rudder,
p209
aVwe hope that if we keep working on this hull design
p210
aVwe can improve and have less resistance.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe other thing is, most boats, when they reach
p213
aVa certain speed, and they are going on waves,
p214
aVthey start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,
p215
aVand a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
p216
aVBut if we're going with the flow,
p217
aVif we pay attention to natural patterns
p218
aVinstead of trying to be strong,
p219
aVbut if you're going with the flow, we may absorb
p220
aVa lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,
p221
aVto actually save some energy to move forward.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we may have developed the technology
p224
aVwhich is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,
p225
aVbut the idea is, what is the purpose of technology
p226
aVif it doesn't reach the right hands?
p227
aa(lp228
VNormal technology or innovation happens like this:
p229
aVSomebody has an interesting idea,
p230
aVsome other scientist or engineer,
p231
aVthey take it to the next level, they make a theory about it
p232
aVand maybe they patent it,
p233
aVand then some industry will make a contract
p234
aVof exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,
p235
aVand then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,
p236
aVand we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.
p237
aVWhat we really want is that this innovation happens
p238
aVcontinuously. The inventor and engineers
p239
aVand also the manufacturers and everybody
p240
aVworks at the same time, but this would be sterile
p241
aVif this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.
p242
aVWhat you really want is not a sequential,
p243
aVnot parallel development.
p244
aVYou want to have a network of innovation.
p245
aVYou want everybody, like we're doing now,
p246
aVto work at the same time, and that can only happen
p247
aVif these people all together decide to share the information,
p248
aVand that's exactly what open hardware is about.
p249
aVIt's to replace competition by collaboration.
p250
aVIt's to transform any new product into a new market.
p251
aVSo what is open hardware?
p252
aVEssentially, open hardware is a license.
p253
aVIt's just an intellectual property setup.
p254
aVIt means that everybody is free to use,
p255
aVmodify and distribute, and in exchange
p256
aVwe only ask for two things:
p257
aVThe name is credited \u2014 the name of the project \u2014
p258
aVand also the people who make improvement,
p259
aVthey share back with the community.
p260
aVSo it's a very simple condition.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,
p263
aVbut quickly after I wanted to publish and share
p264
aVthis information, so I made a Kickstarter,
p265
aVwhich is a crowd-fundraising platform,
p266
aVand in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.
p267
aVWith this money, I hired a team of young engineers
p268
aVfrom all over the world, and we rented a factory
p269
aVin Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
p270
aVWe were peer-learning, we were engineering,
p271
aVwe were making things, prototyping,
p272
aVbut most importantly we were trying our prototypes
p273
aVin the water as often as possible,
p274
aVto fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.
p275
aVThis is a proud member of Protei from Korea,
p276
aVand on the right side, this is a multiple-masts
p277
aVdesign proposed by a team in Mexico.
p278
aVThis idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine
p279
aVin New York, and so she decided to prototype
p280
aVthis idea that she saw, and she documented
p281
aVevery step of the process,
p282
aVand she published it on Instructables,
p283
aVwhich is a website for sharing inventions.
p284
aVLess than one week after,
p285
aVthis is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
p286
aVThey made it, but they eventually published
p287
aVa simplified design.
p288
aVThey also made it into an Instructable,
p289
aVand in less than one week, they had
p290
aValmost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.
p291
aVWe're working on also simpler technology,
p292
aVnot that complex, with younger people
p293
aVand also older people,
p294
aVlike this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VSo Protei is now an international network
p297
aVof innovation for selling technology
p298
aVusing this shape-shifting hull.
p299
aVAnd what puts us together is that we have a common,
p300
aVat least, global understanding
p301
aVof what the word "business" is, or what it should be.
p302
aVThis is how most work today.
p303
aVBusiness as usual is saying, what's most important
p304
aVis to make lots of profit, and you'll be using
p305
aVtechnology for that, and people will be your work force,
p306
aVinstrumentalized,
p307
aVand environment is usually the last priority.
p308
aVIt will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience
p309
aVand, say, increase your price tag.
p310
aa(lp311
VWhat we're trying to do, or what we believe,
p312
aVbecause this is how we believe the world really works,
p313
aVis that without the environment you have nothing.
p314
aVWe have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,
p315
aVand we're a technology company,
p316
aVand profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p319
aa(lp320
VIf we have the courage to understand or accept
p321
aVthat this actually how the world really works,
p322
aVand this is the order of priority that we need to choose,
p323
aVthen it makes obvious why we need
p324
aVto choose open hardware for developing environmental
p325
aVtechnology, because we need to share information.
p326
aa(lp327
VWhat's next for us?
p328
aa(lp329
VSo, this small machine that you've seen,
p330
aVwe're hoping to make small toys like
p331
aVone-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade \u2014
p332
aVso replace the remote control parts by Androids,
p333
aVso the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,
p334
aVso you could be controlling this
p335
aVfrom your mobile phone, your tablet.
p336
aVThen what we want to do is create six-meter versions
p337
aVso we can test the maximum performance of these machines,
p338
aVso we can go at very, very high speed.
p339
aVSo imagine yourself.
p340
aVYou are laying down in a flexible torpedo,
p341
aVsailing at high speed,
p342
aVcontrolling the shape of the hull with your legs
p343
aVand controlling the sail with your arms.
p344
aVSo that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd we replace the human being \u2014
p347
aVto go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,
p348
aVyou don't want a human to be sailing those robots \u2014
p349
aVwith batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.
p350
aVThis is what our teammates, we dream of at night.
p351
aVWe hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,
p352
aVor we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,
p353
aVor we can have swarms of our machines
p354
aVcontrolled by multi-player video game engines
p355
aVto control many of these machines,
p356
aVto monitor coral reefs
p357
aVor to monitor fisheries.
p358
aa(lp359
VOur hope is that we can use open hardware technology
p360
aVto better understand and protect our oceans.
p361
aa(lp362
VThank you very much. (Applause)
