VWell we all know the World Wide Web
p4
aVhas absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,
p5
aVcommerce and social connectivity,
p6
aVbut where did it all come from?
p7
aVAnd I'll quote three people:
p8
aVVannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.
p9
aVSo let's just run through these guys.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is Vannevar Bush.
p12
aVVannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.
p13
aVAnd in 1945,
p14
aVhe published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.
p15
aVAnd the article was called "As We May Think."
p16
aVAnd what Vannevar Bush was saying
p17
aVwas the way we use information is broken.
p18
aVWe don't work in terms of libraries
p19
aVand catalog systems and so forth.
p20
aVThe brain works by association.
p21
aVWith one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.
p22
aVAnd the way information is structured
p23
aVis totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd so he suggested a machine,
p26
aVand he called it the memex.
p27
aVAnd the memex would link information,
p28
aVone piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.
p29
aVNow this was in 1945.
p30
aVA computer in those days
p31
aVwas something the secret services used to use for code breaking.
p32
aVAnd nobody knew anything about it.
p33
aVSo this was before the computer was invented.
p34
aVAnd he proposed this machine called the memex.
p35
aVAnd he had a platform where you linked information to other information,
p36
aVand then you could call it up at will.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo spinning forward,
p39
aVone of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,
p40
aVand he was a U.S. Air Force officer.
p41
aVAnd he was reading it in their library in the Far East.
p42
aVAnd he was so inspired by this article,
p43
aVit kind of directed the rest of his life.
p44
aVAnd by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action
p45
aVwhen he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.
p46
aVHe built a system.
p47
aVThe system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.
p48
aVAnd in a premonition of today's world
p49
aVof cloud computing and softwares of service,
p50
aVhis system was called NLS
p51
aVfor oN-Line System.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd this is Doug Engelbart.
p54
aVHe was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference
p55
aVin 1968.
p56
aVWhat he showed \u2014
p57
aVhe sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.
p58
aVHe had his head mic like I've got.
p59
aVAnd he works this system.
p60
aVAnd you can see, he's working between documents
p61
aVand graphics and so forth.
p62
aVAnd he's driving it all
p63
aVwith this platform here,
p64
aVwith a five-finger keyboard
p65
aVand the world's first computer mouse,
p66
aVwhich he specially designed in order to do this system.
p67
aVSo this is where the mouse came from as well.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this is Doug Engelbart.
p70
aVThe trouble with Doug Engelbart's system
p71
aVwas that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.
p72
aVSo for a personal computer,
p73
aVa few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;
p74
aVit wasn't really very practical.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut spin on to the 80s
p77
aVwhen personal computers did arrive,
p78
aVthen there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.
p79
aVAnd my company, OWL
p80
aVbuilt a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.
p81
aVAnd we delivered the world's first hypertext system.
p82
aVAnd this began to get a head of steam.
p83
aVApple introduced a thing called HyperCard,
p84
aVand they made a bit of a fuss about it.
p85
aVThey had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.
p86
aVThe magazines started to cover it.
p87
aVByte magazine and Communications at the ACM
p88
aVhad special issues covering hypertext.
p89
aVWe developed a PC version of this product
p90
aVas well as the Macintosh version.
p91
aVAnd our PC version became quite mature.
p92
aa(lp93
VThese are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.
p94
aVYou were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
p95
aVWe developed a system such
p96
aVthat it had a markup language based on html.
p97
aVWe called it hml: hypertext markup language.
p98
aVAnd the system was capable of doing
p99
aVvery, very large documentation systems over computer networks.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris
p102
aVin late November 1990.
p103
aVAnd I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee
p104
aVwho said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."
p105
aVAnd he said, "I need to talk to you."
p106
aVAnd he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.
p107
aVAnd I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,
p108
aVespecially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.
p109
aVBut he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web
p110
aVwould take over the world one day.
p111
aVAnd he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,
p112
aVbecause his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;
p113
aVit was just plain text.
p114
aVI thought, well, you know, interesting,
p115
aVbut a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.
p116
aVSo we didn't do it.
p117
aa(lp118
VIn the next couple of years,
p119
aVthe hypertext community didn't recognize him either.
p120
aVIn 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.
p121
aVIn 1993,
p122
aVthere was a table at the conference in Seattle,
p123
aVand a guy called Marc Andreessen
p124
aVwas demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.
p125
aVAnd I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.
p126
aVAnd the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,
p127
aVand I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo that puts me in pretty illustrious company.
p130
aVThere was a guy called Dick Rowe
p131
aVwho was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.
p132
aVThere was a guy called Gary Kildall
p133
aVwho went flying his plane
p134
aVwhen IBM came looking for an operating system
p135
aVfor the IBM PC,
p136
aVand he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.
p137
aVAnd the 12 publishers
p138
aVwho turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.
p139
aa(lp140
VOn the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen
p141
aVwho wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.
p142
aVAnd according to Fortune magazine,
p143
aVhe's worth 700 million dollars.
p144
aVBut is he happy?
