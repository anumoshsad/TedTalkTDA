VThe world makes you something that you're not,
p4
aVbut you know inside what you are,
p5
aVand that question burns in your heart:
p6
aVHow will you become that?
p7
aVI may be somewhat unique in this,
p8
aVbut I am not alone,
p9
aVnot alone at all.
p10
aVSo when I became a fashion model,
p11
aVI felt that I'd finally achieved the dream
p12
aVthat I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
p13
aVMy outside self finally matched my inner truth,
p14
aVmy inner self.
p15
aVFor complicated reasons which I'll get to later,
p16
aVwhen I look at this picture,
p17
aVat that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,
p18
aVyou've made it,
p19
aVyou have arrived.
p20
aVBut this past October,
p21
aVI realized that I'm only just beginning.
p22
aVAll of us are put in boxes by our family,
p23
aVby our religion,
p24
aVby our society,
p25
aVour moment in history,
p26
aVeven our own bodies.
p27
aVSome people have the courage to break free,
p28
aVnot to accept the limitations imposed by
p29
aVthe color of their skin
p30
aVor by the beliefs of those that surround them.
p31
aVThose people are always the threat
p32
aVto the status quo,
p33
aVto what is considered acceptable.
p34
aa(lp35
VIn my case, for the last nine years,
p36
aVsome of my neighbors,
p37
aVsome of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,
p38
aVdid not know about my history.
p39
aVI think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.
p40
aVHere is mine.
p41
aa(lp42
VI was assigned boy at birth
p43
aVbased on the appearance of my genitalia.
p44
aVI remember when I was five years old
p45
aVin the Philippines walking around our house,
p46
aVI would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
p47
aVAnd my mom asked me,
p48
aV"How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"
p49
aVI said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."
p50
aVI knew then how to self-identify.
p51
aa(lp52
VGender has always been considered a fact,
p53
aVimmutable,
p54
aVbut we now know it's actually more fluid,
p55
aVcomplex and mysterious.
p56
aVBecause of my success, I never had the courage
p57
aVto share my story,
p58
aVnot because I thought what I am is wrong,
p59
aVbut because of how the world treats those of us
p60
aVwho wish to break free.
p61
aVEvery day,
p62
aVI am so grateful because I am a woman.
p63
aVI have a mom and dad and family
p64
aVwho accepted me for who I am.
p65
aVMany are not so fortunate.
p66
aa(lp67
VThere's a long tradition in Asian culture
p68
aVthat celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.
p69
aVThere is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
p70
aVThere is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.
p71
aVSo when I was eight years old,
p72
aVI was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating
p73
aVthese mysteries.
p74
aVI was in front of the stage,
p75
aVand I remember, out comes this beautiful woman
p76
aVright in front of me,
p77
aVand I remember that moment something hit me:
p78
aVThat is the kind of woman I would like to be.
p79
aVSo when I was 15 years old,
p80
aVstill dressing as a boy,
p81
aVI met this woman named T.L.
p82
aVShe is a transgender beauty pageant manager.
p83
aVThat night she asked me,
p84
aV"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"
p85
aVShe convinced me that if I joined
p86
aVthat she would take care of the registration fee
p87
aVand the garments,
p88
aVand that night,
p89
aVI won best in swimsuit
p90
aVand best in long gown
p91
aVand placed second runner up
p92
aVamong 40-plus candidates.
p93
aVThat moment changed my life.
p94
aVAll of a sudden, I was introduced
p95
aVto the world of beauty pageants.
p96
aVNot a lot of people could say that your first job
p97
aVis a pageant queen for transgender women,
p98
aVbut I'll take it.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo from 15 to 17 years old, I joined
p101
aVthe most prestigious pageant
p102
aVto the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally,
p103
aVor sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field,
p104
aVand when it rains \u2014
p105
aVit rains a lot in the Philippines \u2014
p106
aVthe organizers would have to move it
p107
aVinside someone's house.
p108
aVI also experienced the goodness of strangers,
p109
aVespecially when we would travel
p110
aVin remote provinces in the Philippines.
p111
aVBut most importantly, I met
p112
aVsome of my best friends in that community.
p113
aa(lp114
VIn 2001,
p115
aVmy mom, who had moved to San Francisco,
p116
aVcalled me and told me that my green card petition came through,
p117
aVthat I could now move to the United States.
p118
aVI resisted it.
p119
aVI told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.
p120
aVI'm here with my friends,
p121
aVI love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."
p122
aVBut then two weeks later she called me, she said,
p123
aV"Did you know that if you move to the United States
p124
aVyou could change your name and gender marker?"
p125
aVThat was all I needed to hear.
p126
aVMy mom also told me to put two E's
p127
aVin the spelling of my name.
p128
aVShe also came with me when I had my surgery
p129
aVin Thailand at 19 years old.
p130
aVIt's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand,
p131
aVthey perform some of the most prestigious,
p132
aVsafe and sophisticated surgery.
p133
aVAt that time in the United States,
p134
aVyou needed to have surgery
p135
aVbefore you could change your name and gender marker.
p136
aVSo in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,
p137
aVand I remember looking at my California driver's license
p138
aVwith the name Geena
p139
aVand gender marker F.
p140
aVThat was a powerful moment.
p141
aVFor some people,
p142
aVtheir I.D. is their license to drive
p143
aVor even to get a drink,
p144
aVbut for me, that was my license to live,
p145
aVto feel dignified.
p146
aVAll of a sudden, my fears were minimized.
p147
aVI felt that I could conquer my dream
p148
aVand move to New York and be a model.
p149
aa(lp150
VMany are not so fortunate.
p151
aVI think of this woman named Islan Nettles.
p152
aVShe's from New York, she's a young woman
p153
aVwho was courageously living her truth,
p154
aVbut hatred ended her life.
p155
aVFor most of my community,
p156
aVthis is the reality in which we live.
p157
aVOur suicide rate is nine times higher
p158
aVthan that of the general population.
p159
aVEvery November 20,
p160
aVwe have a global vigil
p161
aVfor Transgender Day of Remembrance.
p162
aVI'm here at this stage
p163
aVbecause it's a long history of people who fought
p164
aVand stood up for injustice.
p165
aVThis is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
p166
aVToday, this very moment,
p167
aVis my real coming out.
p168
aVI could no longer live my truth
p169
aVfor and by myself.
p170
aVI want to do my best to help others
p171
aVlive their truth without shame and terror.
p172
aVI am here, exposed,
p173
aVso that one day there will never be a need
p174
aVfor a November 20 vigil.
p175
aa(lp176
VMy deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
p177
aVWill you?
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you very much.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VKathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.
p185
aVI'm wondering what you would say,
p186
aVespecially to parents,
p187
aVbut in a more broad way, to friends,
p188
aVto family, to anyone who finds themselves
p189
aVencountering a child or a person
p190
aVwho is struggling with and uncomfortable with
p191
aVa gender that's being assigned them,
p192
aVwhat might you say
p193
aVto the family members of that person
p194
aVto help them become good and caring and kind
p195
aVfamily members to them?
p196
aa(lp197
VGeena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.
p198
aVThe support system, with my mom especially,
p199
aVand my family, that in itself
p200
aVis just so powerful.
p201
aVI remember every time I would coach
p202
aVyoung trans women, I would mentor them,
p203
aVand sometimes when they would call me
p204
aVand tell me that their parents can't accept it,
p205
aVI would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,
p206
aV"Mom, can you call this woman?"
p207
aVAnd sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so \u2014
p208
aVBut it's just, gender identity
p209
aVis in the core of our being, right?
p210
aVI mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,
p211
aVso what I'm trying to do
p212
aVis to have this conversation that
p213
aVsometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,
p214
aVand there should be a space
p215
aVthat would allow people to self-identify,
p216
aVand that's a conversation that we should have
p217
aVwith parents, with colleagues.
p218
aVThe transgender movement,
p219
aVit's at the very beginning,
p220
aVto compare to how the gay movement started.
p221
aVThere's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
p222
aVThere should be an understanding.
p223
aVThere should be a space of curiosity
p224
aVand asking questions,
p225
aVand I hope all of you guys will be my allies.
p226
aa(lp227
VKS: Thank you. That was so lovely. GR: Thank you.
