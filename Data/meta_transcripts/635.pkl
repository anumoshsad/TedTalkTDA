(lp3
VSo the question is, what is invisible?
p4
aVThere is more of it than you think, actually.
p5
aVEverything, I would say. Everything that matters
p6
aVexcept every thing and except matter.
p7
aa(lp8
VWe can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.
p9
aVAs in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:
p10
aV"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,
p11
aVwhen the husband was killed by the wife."
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVThere's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, we can see the stars and the planets,
p17
aVbut we can't see what holds them apart
p18
aVor what draws them together.
p19
aVWith matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.
p20
aVWe can't see into the engine room.
p21
aVWe can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.
p22
aVAnd the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.
p23
aVIn fact, if you look really closely at stuff,
p24
aVif you look at the basic substructure of matter,
p25
aVthere isn't anything there.
p26
aVElectrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
p27
aVand there is only energy. And you can't see energy.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.
p30
aVOne slightly silly thing that's invisible
p31
aVis this story, which is invisible to you.
p32
aVAnd I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
p33
aVIt's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.
p36
aVWherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed
p37
aVby a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVTry as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
p40
aVA few days later he received a letter from a constituent
p41
aVsaying how much she admired him,
p42
aVhad met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.
p43
aVAfter her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
V"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.
p47
aV"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,
p48
aVshe turns it to her advantage.
p49
aVA photo is not enough."
p50
aVSo he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.
p51
aVAnd on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,
p52
aV"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
p53
aVAfter it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,
p54
aV"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?
p55
aVI wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VI bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, one of the interesting things about invisibility
p62
aVis that things that we can't see
p63
aVwe also can't understand.
p64
aVGravity is one thing that we can't see
p65
aVand which we don't understand.
p66
aVIt's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,
p67
aVand the weakest.
p68
aVAnd nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.
p69
aa(lp70
VFor what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,
p71
aVhe thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.
p72
aVThat's what he thought he was there for.
p73
aVSo, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VConsciousness. I see all your faces.
p77
aVI have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?
p78
aVIsn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?
p79
aVBut we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
p80
aVBut we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,
p83
aVwhich some claim is the route of all religions,
p84
aVSufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
p85
aVBut their main exercise of telepathy
p86
aVis to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
p87
aVSo that's why we don't think it exists,
p88
aVthe Sufi masters working on us.
p89
aa(lp90
VIn the question of consciousness
p91
aVand artificial intelligence,
p92
aVartificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,
p93
aVgotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.
p94
aVWith artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,
p95
aVthey haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VThe laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.
p99
aVRemind you of anyone?
p100
aVInteresting. I'm, as you can guess,
p101
aVnot a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.
p102
aVAnd I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?
p103
aVI'm an ignostic.
p104
aVI refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,
p105
aVuntil somebody properly defines the terms.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VAnother thing we can't see is the human genome.
p109
aVAnd this is increasingly peculiar,
p110
aVbecause about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,
p111
aVthey thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.
p112
aVGeneticists will know this, but every year since,
p113
aVit's been revised downwards.
p114
aVWe now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000
p115
aVgenes in the human genome.
p116
aa(lp117
VThis is extraordinary. Because rice \u2014 get this \u2014
p118
aVrice is known to have 38 thousand genes.
p119
aVPotatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?
p120
aVTwo more than people,
p121
aVand the same as a gorilla.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVYou can't see these things, but they are very strange.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VThe stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.
p127
aVThe universe disappears.
p128
aVThe more light there is, the less you can see.
p129
aa(lp130
VTime, nobody can see time.
p131
aVI don't know if you know this. Modern physics,
p132
aVthere is a big movement in modern physics
p133
aVto decide that time doesn't really exist,
p134
aVbecause it's too inconvenient for the figures.
p135
aVIt's much easier if it's not really there.
p136
aVYou can't see the future, obviously.
p137
aVAnd you can't see the past, except in your memory.
p138
aa(lp139
VOne of the interesting things about the past is
p140
aVyou particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,
p141
aVhe said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"
p142
aVAnd I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"
p143
aa(lp144
VIsn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember
p145
aVwhat happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,
p146
aVwhich is great news for psychoanalysts,
p147
aVbecause otherwise they'd be out of a job.
p148
aVBecause that's where all the stuff happens
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVthat makes you who you are.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnother thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.
p153
aVThis is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
p154
aVthat cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.
p155
aVSkin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.
p156
aVBut every cell in your body is replaced at some point.
p157
aVTaste buds, every 10 days or so.
p158
aVLivers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.
p159
aVBut at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body
p160
aVremains from what was there seven years ago.
p161
aVThe question is, who, then, are we?
p162
aVWhat are we? What is this thing that we hang on,
p163
aVthat is actually us?
p164
aa(lp165
VOkay. Atoms, you can't see them.
p166
aVNobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.
p167
aVGas, you can't see that.
p168
aVInteresting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.
p169
aVGas was invented in 1600
p170
aVby a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
p171
aVIt's said to be the most successful ever invention
p172
aVof a word by a known individual.
p173
aVQuite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"
p174
aVmeaning astral radiation.
p175
aVDidn't catch on, unfortunately.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVBut well done, him.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VThere is so many things that \u2014 Light.
p181
aVYou can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,
p182
aVif a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
p183
aVyou won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.
p184
aVBut it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,
p185
aVyou can only see what it hits.
p186
aVI find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,
p187
aVnot to be able to see darkness.
p188
aa(lp189
VElectricity, you can't see that.
p190
aVDon't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
p191
aVThey don't. Nobody knows what it is.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVYou probably think the electrons in an electric wire
p194
aVmove instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light
p195
aVwhen you turn the light on. They don't.
p196
aVElectrons bumble down the wire,
p197
aVabout the speed of spreading honey, they say.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VGalaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.
p201
aV100 billion. How many can we see? Five.
p202
aVFive out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,
p203
aVand one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.
p204
aa(lp205
VRadio waves. There's another thing.
p206
aVHeinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,
p207
aVhe called them radio waves because they radiated.
p208
aVAnd somebody said to him,
p209
aV"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?
p210
aVWhat's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"
p211
aVAnd he said, "Well, I've no idea.
p212
aVBut I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."
p213
aVAnd that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnyway, so the biggest thing
p216
aVthat's invisible to us is what we don't know.
p217
aVIt is incredible how little we know.
p218
aVThomas Edison once said,
p219
aV"We don't know one percent of one millionth
p220
aVabout anything."
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd I've come to the conclusion \u2014
p223
aVbecause you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"
p224
aVThe point, most of us. What's the point?
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aVYou can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,
p228
aVlike an electron, oddly enough.
p229
aa(lp230
VBut the point, what I've got it down to,
p231
aVis there are only two questions really worth asking.
p232
aV"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?
p233
aVAnd to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,
p234
aVperhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,
p235
aVone a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,
p238
aV"I don't know why we are here.
p239
aVBut I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVHe was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,
p245
aVone of my favorite poets, who said,
p246
aV"We are here on earth
p247
aVto help others.
p248
aVWhat the others are here for, I've no idea."
