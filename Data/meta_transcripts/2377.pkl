VThere's something about caves \u2014
p4
aVa shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in.
p5
aVAs you pass through the portal between light and dark,
p6
aVyou enter a subterranean world \u2014
p7
aVa place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.
p8
aa(lp9
VLong ago in Europe,
p10
aVancient people also entered these underground worlds.
p11
aVAs witness to their passage,
p12
aVthey left behind mysterious engravings and paintings,
p13
aVlike this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain.
p14
aVYou now walk the same path as these early artists.
p15
aVAnd in this surreal, otherworldly place,
p16
aVit's almost possible to imagine
p17
aVthat you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth,
p18
aVor that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhen I'm in a cave,
p21
aVI often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep
p22
aVto brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark?
p23
aVIn this video clip,
p24
aVthat was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground,
p25
aVin the cave of Cudon in Spain,
p26
aVwe found a series of red paintings on a ceiling
p27
aVin a previously unexplored section of the cave.
p28
aVAs we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower,
p29
aVwe finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low
p30
aVthat my husband and project photographer, Dylan,
p31
aVcould no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.
p32
aVSo while he filmed me,
p33
aVI kept following the trail of red paint with a single light
p34
aVand a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion.
p35
aVHalf a kilometer underground.
p36
aa(lp37
VSeriously.
p38
aVWhat was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VI mean \u2014 me, it makes sense, right?
p43
aa(lp44
VBut you know,
p45
aVthis is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research.
p46
aVI study some of the oldest art in the world.
p47
aVIt was created by these early artists in Europe,
p48
aVbetween 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.
p49
aVAnd the thing is
p50
aVthat I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful,
p51
aVthough some of it certainly is.
p52
aVBut what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind,
p53
aVof the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought,
p54
aVabout what it means to be human.
p55
aVWhile all species communicate in one way or another,
p56
aVonly we humans have really taken it to another level.
p57
aVOur desire and ability to share and collaborate
p58
aVhas been a huge part of our success story.
p59
aVOur modern world is based on a global network of information exchange
p60
aVmade possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate \u2014
p61
aVin particular, using graphic or written forms of communication.
p62
aVThe thing is, though,
p63
aVthat we've been building on the mental achievements
p64
aVof those that came before us for so long
p65
aVthat it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed.
p66
aVIt's one of the things I find most fascinating
p67
aVabout studying our deep history.
p68
aVThose people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on.
p69
aVThey were the original shoulders.
p70
aVAnd while a surprising number of important inventions
p71
aVcome out of that distant time,
p72
aVwhat I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.
p73
aa(lp74
VThere are three main types of communication,
p75
aVspoken, gestural \u2014 so things like sign language \u2014
p76
aVand graphic communication.
p77
aVSpoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.
p78
aVIt requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.
p79
aVAnd after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever.
p80
aVGraphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship.
p81
aVAnd with its invention, it became possible for the first time
p82
aVfor a message to be transmitted and preserved
p83
aVbeyond a single moment in place and time.
p84
aa(lp85
VEurope is one of the first places
p86
aVthat we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing
p87
aVin caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites.
p88
aVBut this is not the Europe we know today.
p89
aVThis was a world dominated by towering ice sheets,
p90
aVthree to four kilometers high,
p91
aVwith sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra.
p92
aVThis was the Ice Age.
p93
aa(lp94
VOver the last century,
p95
aVmore than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent,
p96
aVdecorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human
p97
aVlike these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.
p98
aVThey provide us with a rare glimpse
p99
aVinto the creative world and imagination of these early artists.
p100
aa(lp101
VSince their discovery,
p102
aVit's been the animals that have received the majority of the study
p103
aVlike this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain,
p104
aVor this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega.
p105
aVBut for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs,
p106
aVthat drew me to study the art.
p107
aVThe funny this is that at most sites
p108
aVthe geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images.
p109
aVBut when I started on this back in 2007,
p110
aVthere wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were,
p111
aVnor was there a strong sense
p112
aVof whether the same ones appeared across space or time.
p113
aVBefore I could even get started on my questions,
p114
aVmy first step was to compile a database
p115
aVof all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites.
p116
aVThe problem was that while they were well documented at some sites,
p117
aVusually the ones with the very nice animals,
p118
aVthere was also a large number of them where it was very vague \u2014
p119
aVthere wasn't a lot of description or detail.
p120
aVSome of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more.
p121
aVThese were the ones that I targeted for my field work.
p122
aa(lp123
VOver the course of two years,
p124
aVmy faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground,
p125
aVhiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites
p126
aVin France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.
p127
aVAnd it was totally worth it.
p128
aVWe found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited.
p129
aVThis is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need
p130
aVif I wanted to start answering those larger questions.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo let's get to those answers.
p133
aVBarring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs.
p134
aVOnly 32 signs
p135
aVacross a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe.
p136
aVThat is a very small number.
p137
aVNow, if these were random doodles or decorations,
p138
aVwe would expect to see a lot more variation,
p139
aVbut instead what we find are the same signs
p140
aVrepeating across both space and time.
p141
aVSome signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing,
p142
aVwhile other signs are later inventions.
p143
aVBut 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period \u2014
p144
aVthings like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles
p145
aVlike we see here from the end of the Ice Age,
p146
aVat a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains.
p147
aVAnd while certain signs span thousands of kilometers,
p148
aVother signs had much more restricted distribution patterns,
p149
aVwith some being limited to a single territory,
p150
aVlike we see here with these divided rectangles
p151
aVthat are only found in northern Spain,
p152
aVand which some researchers have speculated
p153
aVcould be some sort of family or clan signs.
p154
aa(lp155
VOn a side note,
p156
aVthere is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art
p157
aVfound all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia.
p158
aVWith many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places,
p159
aVespecially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range,
p160
aVit's starting to seem increasingly likely
p161
aVthat this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa.
p162
aVBut that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo back to the matter at hand.
p165
aVThere could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators,
p166
aVlike these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures
p167
aVfrom La Roque de Venasque in France.
p168
aVWe might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did.
p169
aVThe repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites
p170
aVtells us that the artists were making intentional choices.
p171
aVIf we're talking about geometric shapes,
p172
aVwith specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings,
p173
aVthan we could very well be looking
p174
aVat one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.
p175
aa(lp176
VI'm not talking about writing yet.
p177
aVThere's just not enough characters at this point
p178
aVto have represented all of the words in the spoken language,
p179
aVsomething which is a requirement for a full writing system.
p180
aVNor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough
p181
aVto suggest that they were some sort of alphabet.
p182
aVBut what we do have are some intriguing one-offs,
p183
aVlike this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription,"
p184
aVwith its symmetrical markings on the left,
p185
aVpossible stylized representations of hands in the middle,
p186
aVand what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe oldest systems of graphic communication in the world \u2014
p189
aVSumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script,
p190
aVall emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago,
p191
aVwith each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem
p192
aVmade up of counting marks and pictographic representations,
p193
aVwhere the meaning and the image were the same.
p194
aVSo a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal.
p195
aVIt's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized,
p196
aVuntil they almost become unrecognizable
p197
aVand that we also start to see more symbols being invented
p198
aVto represent all those other missing words in language \u2014
p199
aVthings like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo knowing all this,
p202
aVit seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe
p203
aVwere truly abstract written characters.
p204
aVInstead, what's much more likely
p205
aVis that these early artists were also making counting marks,
p206
aVmaybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,
p207
aVas well as creating stylized representations
p208
aVof things from the world around them.
p209
aVCould some of the signs be weaponry or housing?
p210
aVOr what about celestial objects like star constellations?
p211
aVOr maybe even rivers, mountains, trees \u2014 landscape features,
p212
aVpossibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs
p213
aVfrom the site of El Castillo in Spain.
p214
aVThe term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin,
p215
aVbut could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree?
p216
aVSome researchers have begun to ask these questions
p217
aVabout certain signs at specific sites,
p218
aVbut I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole.
p219
aVThe irony in all of this, of course,
p220
aVis that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category,
p221
aVI have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart
p222
aVas different types of imagery are identified and separated off.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow don't get me wrong,
p225
aVthe later creation of fully developed writing
p226
aVwas an impressive feat in its own right.
p227
aVBut it's important to remember
p228
aVthat those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum.
p229
aVAnd that even 5,000 years ago,
p230
aVpeople were already building on something much older,
p231
aVwith its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years \u2014
p232
aVto the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,
p233
aVto that point, deep in our collective history,
p234
aVwhen someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark,
p235
aVand forever changed the nature of how we communicate.
