VWe're here to celebrate compassion.
p4
aVBut compassion, from my vantage point,
p5
aVhas a problem.
p6
aVAs essential as it is across our traditions,
p7
aVas real as so many of us know it to be
p8
aVin particular lives,
p9
aVthe word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,
p10
aVand it is suspect in my field of journalism.
p11
aVIt's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,
p12
aVor it's seen as potentially depressing.
p13
aVKaren Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story
p14
aVof giving a speech in Holland
p15
aVand, after the fact, the word "compassion"
p16
aVwas translated as "pity."
p17
aa(lp18
VNow compassion, when it enters the news,
p19
aVtoo often comes in the form
p20
aVof feel-good feature pieces
p21
aVor sidebars about heroic people
p22
aVyou could never be like
p23
aVor happy endings
p24
aVor examples of self-sacrifice
p25
aVthat would seem to be too good to be true
p26
aVmost of the time.
p27
aVOur cultural imagination about compassion
p28
aVhas been deadened by idealistic images.
p29
aVAnd so what I'd like to do this morning
p30
aVfor the next few minutes
p31
aVis perform a linguistic resurrection.
p32
aVAnd I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise
p33
aVthat words matter,
p34
aVthat they shape the way we understand ourselves,
p35
aVthe way we interpret the world
p36
aVand the way we treat others.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhen this country
p39
aVfirst encountered genuine diversity
p40
aVin the 1960s,
p41
aVwe adopted tolerance
p42
aVas the core civic virtue
p43
aVwith which we would approach that.
p44
aVNow the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,
p45
aVconnotes "allowing," "indulging"
p46
aVand "enduring."
p47
aVIn the medical context that it comes from,
p48
aVit is about testing the limits of thriving
p49
aVin an unfavorable environment.
p50
aVTolerance is not really a lived virtue;
p51
aVit's more of a cerebral ascent.
p52
aVAnd it's too cerebral
p53
aVto animate guts and hearts
p54
aVand behavior
p55
aVwhen the going gets rough.
p56
aVAnd the going is pretty rough right now.
p57
aVI think that without perhaps being able to name it,
p58
aVwe are collectively experiencing
p59
aVthat we've come as far as we can
p60
aVwith tolerance as our only guiding virtue.
p61
aa(lp62
VCompassion is a worthy successor.
p63
aVIt is organic,
p64
aVacross our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,
p65
aVand yet it transcends them.
p66
aVCompassion is a piece of vocabulary
p67
aVthat could change us if we truly let it sink into
p68
aVthe standards to which we hold ourselves and others,
p69
aVboth in our private and in our civic spaces.
p70
aVSo what is it, three-dimensionally?
p71
aVWhat are its kindred and component parts?
p72
aVWhat's in its universe of attendant virtues?
p73
aVTo start simply,
p74
aVI want to say that compassion is kind.
p75
aVNow "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,
p76
aVand it's prone to its own abundant cliche.
p77
aVBut kindness is an everyday byproduct
p78
aVof all the great virtues.
p79
aVAnd it is a most edifying form
p80
aVof instant gratification.
p81
aa(lp82
VCompassion is also curious.
p83
aVCompassion cultivates and practices curiosity.
p84
aVI love a phrase that was offered me
p85
aVby two young women
p86
aVwho are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,
p87
aVAziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.
p88
aVThey are working to create a new imagination
p89
aVabout shared life among young Jews and Muslims,
p90
aVand as they do that, they cultivate what they call
p91
aV"curiosity without assumptions."
p92
aVWell that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
p93
aa(lp94
VCompassion can be synonymous with empathy.
p95
aVIt can be joined with the harder work
p96
aVof forgiveness and reconciliation,
p97
aVbut it can also express itself
p98
aVin the simple act of presence.
p99
aVIt's linked to practical virtues
p100
aVlike generosity and hospitality
p101
aVand just being there,
p102
aVjust showing up.
p103
aVI think that compassion
p104
aValso is often linked to beauty \u2014
p105
aVand by that I mean a willingness
p106
aVto see beauty in the other,
p107
aVnot just what it is about them
p108
aVthat might need helping.
p109
aVI love it that my Muslim conversation partners
p110
aVoften speak of beauty as a core moral value.
p111
aVAnd in that light, for the religious,
p112
aVcompassion also brings us
p113
aVinto the territory of mystery \u2014
p114
aVencouraging us not just
p115
aVto see beauty,
p116
aVbut perhaps also to look for the face of God
p117
aVin the moment of suffering,
p118
aVin the face of a stranger,
p119
aVin the face of the vibrant religious other.
p120
aa(lp121
VI'm not sure if I can show you
p122
aVwhat tolerance looks like,
p123
aVbut I can show you what compassion looks like \u2014
p124
aVbecause it is visible.
p125
aVWhen we see it, we recognize it
p126
aVand it changes the way we think about what is doable,
p127
aVwhat is possible.
p128
aVIt is so important
p129
aVwhen we're communicating big ideas \u2014
p130
aVbut especially a big spiritual idea like compassion \u2014
p131
aVto root it as we present it to others
p132
aVin space and time and flesh and blood \u2014
p133
aVthe color and complexity of life.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd compassion does seek physicality.
p136
aVI first started to learn this most vividly
p137
aVfrom Matthew Sanford.
p138
aVAnd I don't imagine that you will realize this
p139
aVwhen you look at this photograph of him,
p140
aVbut he's paraplegic.
p141
aVHe's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,
p142
aVin a car crash that killed his father and his sister.
p143
aVMatthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,
p144
aVand \u2014 and he does experience this as an "and"
p145
aVrather than a "but" \u2014
p146
aVand he experiences himself
p147
aVto be healed and whole.
p148
aVAnd as a teacher of yoga,
p149
aVhe brings that experience to others
p150
aVacross the spectrum of ability and disability,
p151
aVhealth, illness and aging.
p152
aVHe says that he's just at an extreme end
p153
aVof the spectrum we're all on.
p154
aVHe's doing some amazing work now
p155
aVwith veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
p156
aVAnd Matthew has made this remarkable observation
p157
aVthat I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.
p158
aVI can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
p159
aVBut he says that he has yet to experience someone
p160
aVwho became more aware of their body,
p161
aVin all its frailty and its grace,
p162
aVwithout, at the same time,
p163
aVbecoming more compassionate towards all of life.
p164
aa(lp165
VCompassion also looks like this.
p166
aVThis is Jean Vanier.
p167
aVJean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,
p168
aVwhich you can now find all over the world,
p169
aVcommunities centered around life
p170
aVwith people with mental disabilities \u2014
p171
aVmostly Down syndrome.
p172
aVThe communities that Jean Vanier founded,
p173
aVlike Jean Vanier himself,
p174
aVexude tenderness.
p175
aV"Tender" is another word
p176
aVI would love to spend some time resurrecting.
p177
aVWe spend so much time in this culture
p178
aVbeing driven and aggressive,
p179
aVand I spend a lot of time being those things too.
p180
aVAnd compassion can also have those qualities.
p181
aVBut again and again, lived compassion
p182
aVbrings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
p183
aVJean Vanier says
p184
aVthat his work,
p185
aVlike the work of other people \u2014
p186
aVhis great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa \u2014
p187
aVis never in the first instance about changing the world;
p188
aVit's in the first instance about changing ourselves.
p189
aVHe's says that what they do with L'Arche
p190
aVis not a solution, but a sign.
p191
aVCompassion is rarely a solution,
p192
aVbut it is always a sign of a deeper reality,
p193
aVof deeper human possibilities.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd compassion is unleashed
p196
aVin wider and wider circles
p197
aVby signs and stories,
p198
aVnever by statistics and strategies.
p199
aVWe need those things too,
p200
aVbut we're also bumping up against their limits.
p201
aVAnd at the same time that we are doing that,
p202
aVI think we are rediscovering the power of story \u2014
p203
aVthat as human beings, we need stories
p204
aVto survive, to flourish,
p205
aVto change.
p206
aVOur traditions have always known this,
p207
aVand that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart
p208
aVand carried them forward in time for us.
p209
aVThere is, of course, a story
p210
aVbehind the key moral longing
p211
aVand commandment of Judaism
p212
aVto repair the world \u2014 tikkun olam.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd I'll never forget hearing that story
p215
aVfrom Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,
p216
aVwho told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,
p217
aVthat in the beginning of the Creation
p218
aVsomething happened
p219
aVand the original light of the universe
p220
aVwas shattered into countless pieces.
p221
aVIt lodged as shards
p222
aVinside every aspect of the Creation.
p223
aVAnd that the highest human calling
p224
aVis to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,
p225
aVto gather it up,
p226
aVand in so doing, to repair the world.
p227
aVNow this might sound like a fanciful tale.
p228
aVSome of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.
p229
aVRachel Naomi Remen says
p230
aVthis is an important and empowering story
p231
aVfor our time,
p232
aVbecause this story insists
p233
aVthat each and every one of us,
p234
aVfrail and flawed as we may be,
p235
aVinadequate as we may feel,
p236
aVhas exactly what's needed
p237
aVto help repair the part of the world
p238
aVthat we can see and touch.
p239
aa(lp240
VStories like this,
p241
aVsigns like this,
p242
aVare practical tools
p243
aVin a world longing to bring compassion
p244
aVto abundant images of suffering
p245
aVthat can otherwise overwhelm us.
p246
aVRachel Naomi Remen
p247
aVis actually bringing compassion
p248
aVback to its rightful place alongside science
p249
aVin her field of medicine
p250
aVin the training of new doctors.
p251
aVAnd this trend
p252
aVof what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,
p253
aVhow these kinds of virtues
p254
aVare finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine \u2014
p255
aVthe work Fred Luskin is doing \u2014
p256
aVI think this is one of the most fascinating developments
p257
aVof the 21st century \u2014
p258
aVthat science, in fact,
p259
aVis taking a virtue like compassion
p260
aVdefinitively out of the realm of idealism.
p261
aVThis is going to change science, I believe,
p262
aVand it will change religion.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut here's a face
p265
aVfrom 20th century science
p266
aVthat might surprise you
p267
aVin a discussion about compassion.
p268
aVWe all know about the Albert Einstein
p269
aVwho came up with E = mc2.
p270
aVWe don't hear so much about the Einstein
p271
aVwho invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,
p272
aVto stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton
p273
aVbecause the best hotel there
p274
aVwas segregated and wouldn't have her.
p275
aVWe don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity
p276
aVto advocate for political prisoners in Europe
p277
aVor the Scottsboro boys
p278
aVin the American South.
p279
aa(lp280
VEinstein believed deeply
p281
aVthat science should transcend
p282
aVnational and ethnic divisions.
p283
aVBut he watched physicists and chemists
p284
aVbecome the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction
p285
aVin the early 20th century.
p286
aVHe once said that science in his generation
p287
aVhad become like a razor blade
p288
aVin the hands of a three-year-old.
p289
aVAnd Einstein foresaw
p290
aVthat as we grow more modern
p291
aVand technologically advanced,
p292
aVwe need the virtues
p293
aVour traditions carry forward in time
p294
aVmore, not less.
p295
aVHe liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
p296
aVSome of his favorites were Moses,
p297
aVJesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,
p298
aVGandhi \u2014 he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.
p299
aVAnd Einstein said \u2014
p300
aVand I think this is a quote,
p301
aVagain, that has not been passed down in his legacy \u2014
p302
aVthat "these kinds of people
p303
aVare geniuses in the art of living,
p304
aVmore necessary
p305
aVto the dignity, security and joy of humanity
p306
aVthan the discoverers of objective knowledge."
p307
aa(lp308
VNow invoking Einstein
p309
aVmight not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth
p310
aVand make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,
p311
aVbut actually it is.
p312
aVI want to show you
p313
aVthe rest of this photograph,
p314
aVbecause this photograph
p315
aVis analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture \u2014
p316
aVwe clean it up
p317
aVand we diminish its depths and its grounding
p318
aVin life, which is messy.
p319
aVSo in this photograph
p320
aVyou see a mind looking out a window
p321
aVat what might be a cathedral \u2014 it's not.
p322
aVThis is the full photograph,
p323
aVand you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,
p324
aVsmoking a cigar.
p325
aVAnd by the look of that paunch,
p326
aVhe hasn't been doing enough yoga.
p327
aVWe put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,
p328
aVand someone said, "When I look at the first photo,
p329
aVI ask myself, what was he thinking?
p330
aVAnd when I look at the second, I ask,
p331
aVwhat kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"
p332
aa(lp333
VWell, he was complicated.
p334
aVHe was incredibly compassionate
p335
aVin some of his relationships
p336
aVand terribly inadequate in others.
p337
aVAnd it is much harder, often,
p338
aVto be compassionate towards those closest to us,
p339
aVwhich is another quality in the universe of compassion,
p340
aVon its dark side,
p341
aVthat also deserves our serious attention and illumination.
p342
aVGandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.
p343
aVSo was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.
p344
aVSo was Mother Teresa.
p345
aVSo are we all.
p346
aVAnd I want to say
p347
aVthat it is a liberating thing
p348
aVto realize that that is no obstacle to compassion \u2014
p349
aVfollowing on what Fred Luskin says \u2014
p350
aVthat these flaws just make us human.
p351
aa(lp352
VOur culture is obsessed with perfection
p353
aVand with hiding problems.
p354
aVBut what a liberating thing to realize
p355
aVthat our problems, in fact,
p356
aVare probably our richest sources
p357
aVfor rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,
p358
aVtowards bringing compassion
p359
aVtowards the suffering and joys of others.
p360
aVRachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor
p361
aVbecause of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.
p362
aVEinstein became a humanitarian,
p363
aVnot because of his exquisite knowledge
p364
aVof space and time and matter,
p365
aVbut because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.
p366
aVAnd Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say
p367
aVthat it was some of your very wounding experiences
p368
aVin a religious life that,
p369
aVwith a zigzag,
p370
aVhave led to the Charter for Compassion.
p371
aVCompassion can't be reduced to sainthood
p372
aVany more than it can be reduced to pity.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo I want to propose
p375
aVa final definition of compassion \u2014
p376
aVthis is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way \u2014
p377
aVand that would be for us
p378
aVto call compassion a spiritual technology.
p379
aVNow our traditions contain
p380
aVvast wisdom about this,
p381
aVand we need them to mine it for us now.
p382
aVBut compassion is also equally at home
p383
aVin the secular as in the religious.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo I will paraphrase Einstein in closing
p386
aVand say that humanity,
p387
aVthe future of humanity,
p388
aVneeds this technology
p389
aVas much as it needs all the others
p390
aVthat have now connected us
p391
aVand set before us
p392
aVthe terrifying and wondrous possibility
p393
aVof actually becoming one human race.
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.
