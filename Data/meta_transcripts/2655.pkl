VHere's a startling fact:
p4
aVin the 45 years since the introduction of the automated teller machine,
p5
aVthose vending machines that dispense cash,
p6
aVthe number of human bank tellers employed in the United States
p7
aVhas roughly doubled,
p8
aVfrom about a quarter of a million to a half a million.
p9
aVA quarter of a million in 1970 to about a half a million today,
p10
aVwith 100,000 added since the year 2000.
p11
aa(lp12
VThese facts, revealed in a recent book
p13
aVby Boston University economist James Bessen,
p14
aVraise an intriguing question:
p15
aVwhat are all those tellers doing,
p16
aVand why hasn't automation eliminated their employment by now?
p17
aVIf you think about it,
p18
aVmany of the great inventions of the last 200 years
p19
aVwere designed to replace human labor.
p20
aVTractors were developed
p21
aVto substitute mechanical power for human physical toil.
p22
aVAssembly lines were engineered
p23
aVto replace inconsistent human handiwork
p24
aVwith machine perfection.
p25
aVComputers were programmed to swap out
p26
aVerror-prone, inconsistent human calculation
p27
aVwith digital perfection.
p28
aVThese inventions have worked.
p29
aVWe no longer dig ditches by hand,
p30
aVpound tools out of wrought iron
p31
aVor do bookkeeping using actual books.
p32
aVAnd yet, the fraction of US adults employed in the labor market
p33
aVis higher now in 2016
p34
aVthan it was 125 years ago, in 1890,
p35
aVand it's risen in just about every decade
p36
aVin the intervening 125 years.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis poses a paradox.
p39
aVOur machines increasingly do our work for us.
p40
aVWhy doesn't this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete?
p41
aVWhy are there still so many jobs?
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm going to try to answer that question tonight,
p46
aVand along the way, I'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work
p47
aVand the challenges that automation does and does not pose
p48
aVfor our society.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhy are there so many jobs?
p51
aVThere are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake.
p52
aVOne has to do with human genius
p53
aVand creativity.
p54
aVThe other has to do with human insatiability,
p55
aVor greed, if you like.
p56
aVI'm going to call the first of these the O-ring principle,
p57
aVand it determines the type of work that we do.
p58
aVThe second principle is the never-get-enough principle,
p59
aVand it determines how many jobs there actually are.
p60
aa(lp61
VLet's start with the O-ring.
p62
aVATMs, automated teller machines,
p63
aVhad two countervailing effects on bank teller employment.
p64
aVAs you would expect, they replaced a lot of teller tasks.
p65
aVThe number of tellers per branch fell by about a third.
p66
aVBut banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches,
p67
aVand the number of bank branches increased by about 40 percent
p68
aVin the same time period.
p69
aVThe net result was more branches and more tellers.
p70
aVBut those tellers were doing somewhat different work.
p71
aVAs their routine, cash-handling tasks receded,
p72
aVthey became less like checkout clerks
p73
aVand more like salespeople,
p74
aVforging relationships with customers,
p75
aVsolving problems
p76
aVand introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments:
p77
aVmore tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job.
p78
aVThere's a general principle here.
p79
aVMost of the work that we do
p80
aVrequires a multiplicity of skills,
p81
aVand brains and brawn,
p82
aVtechnical expertise and intuitive mastery,
p83
aVperspiration and inspiration in the words of Thomas Edison.
p84
aVIn general, automating some subset of those tasks
p85
aVdoesn't make the other ones unnecessary.
p86
aVIn fact, it makes them more important.
p87
aVIt increases their economic value.
p88
aa(lp89
VLet me give you a stark example.
p90
aVIn 1986, the space shuttle Challenger
p91
aVexploded and crashed back down to Earth
p92
aVless than two minutes after takeoff.
p93
aVThe cause of that crash, it turned out,
p94
aVwas an inexpensive rubber O-ring in the booster rocket
p95
aVthat had frozen on the launchpad the night before
p96
aVand failed catastrophically moments after takeoff.
p97
aVIn this multibillion dollar enterprise
p98
aVthat simple rubber O-ring
p99
aVmade the difference between mission success
p100
aVand the calamitous death of seven astronauts.
p101
aVAn ingenious metaphor for this tragic setting
p102
aVis the O-ring production function,
p103
aVnamed by Harvard economist Michael Kremer
p104
aVafter the Challenger disaster.
p105
aVThe O-ring production function conceives of the work
p106
aVas a series of interlocking steps,
p107
aVlinks in a chain.
p108
aVEvery one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed.
p109
aVIf any of them fails,
p110
aVthe mission, or the product or the service,
p111
aVcomes crashing down.
p112
aVThis precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication,
p113
aVwhich is that improvements
p114
aVin the reliability of any one link in the chain
p115
aVincreases the value of improving any of the other links.
p116
aVConcretely, if most of the links are brittle and prone to breakage,
p117
aVthe fact that your link is not that reliable
p118
aVis not that important.
p119
aVProbably something else will break anyway.
p120
aVBut as all the other links become robust and reliable,
p121
aVthe importance of your link becomes more essential.
p122
aVIn the limit, everything depends upon it.
p123
aVThe reason the O-ring was critical to space shuttle Challenger
p124
aVis because everything else worked perfectly.
p125
aVIf the Challenger were kind of the space era equivalent
p126
aVof Microsoft Windows 2000 \u2014
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
Vthe reliability of the O-ring wouldn't have mattered
p131
aVbecause the machine would have crashed.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VHere's the broader point.
p136
aVIn much of the work that we do, we are the O-rings.
p137
aVYes, ATMs could do certain cash-handling tasks
p138
aVfaster and better than tellers,
p139
aVbut that didn't make tellers superfluous.
p140
aVIt increased the importance of their problem-solving skills
p141
aVand their relationships with customers.
p142
aVThe same principle applies if we're building a building,
p143
aVif we're diagnosing and caring for a patient,
p144
aVor if we are teaching a class
p145
aVto a roomful of high schoolers.
p146
aVAs our tools improve,
p147
aVtechnology magnifies our leverage
p148
aVand increases the importance of our expertise
p149
aVand our judgment and our creativity.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd that brings me to the second principle:
p152
aVnever get enough.
p153
aVYou may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,
p154
aVthat says the jobs that people do will be important.
p155
aVThey can't be done by machines, but they still need to be done.
p156
aVBut that doesn't tell me how many jobs there will need to be.
p157
aVIf you think about it, isn't it kind of self-evident
p158
aVthat once we get sufficiently productive at something,
p159
aVwe've basically worked our way out of a job?
p160
aVIn 1900, 40 percent of all US employment
p161
aVwas on farms.
p162
aVToday, it's less than two percent.
p163
aVWhy are there so few farmers today?
p164
aVIt's not because we're eating less.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VA century of productivity growth in farming
p169
aVmeans that now, a couple of million farmers
p170
aVcan feed a nation of 320 million.
p171
aVThat's amazing progress,
p172
aVbut it also means there are only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.
p173
aVSo clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.
p174
aVFarming is only one example.
p175
aVThere are many others like it.
p176
aVBut what's true about a single product or service or industry
p177
aVhas never been true about the economy as a whole.
p178
aVMany of the industries in which we now work \u2014
p179
aVhealth and medicine,
p180
aVfinance and insurance,
p181
aVelectronics and computing \u2014
p182
aVwere tiny or barely existent a century ago.
p183
aVMany of the products that we spend a lot of our money on \u2014
p184
aVair conditioners, sport utility vehicles,
p185
aVcomputers and mobile devices \u2014
p186
aVwere unattainably expensive,
p187
aVor just hadn't been invented a century ago.
p188
aVAs automation frees our time, increases the scope of what is possible,
p189
aVwe invent new products, new ideas, new services
p190
aVthat command our attention,
p191
aVoccupy our time
p192
aVand spur consumption.
p193
aVYou may think some of these things are frivolous \u2014
p194
aVextreme yoga, adventure tourism,
p195
aVPokémon GO \u2014
p196
aVand I might agree with you.
p197
aVBut people desire these things, and they're willing to work hard for them.
p198
aVThe average worker in 2015
p199
aVwanting to attain the average living standard in 1915
p200
aVcould do so by working just 17 weeks a year,
p201
aVone third of the time.
p202
aVBut most people don't choose to do that.
p203
aVThey are willing to work hard
p204
aVto harvest the technological bounty that is available to them.
p205
aVMaterial abundance has never eliminated perceived scarcity.
p206
aVIn the words of economist Thorstein Veblen,
p207
aVinvention is the mother of necessity.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow ...
p210
aVSo if you accept these two principles,
p211
aVthe O-ring principle and the never-get-enough principle,
p212
aVthen you agree with me.
p213
aVThere will be jobs.
p214
aVDoes that mean there's nothing to worry about?
p215
aVAutomation, employment, robots and jobs \u2014
p216
aVit'll all take care of itself?
p217
aVNo.
p218
aVThat is not my argument.
p219
aVAutomation creates wealth
p220
aVby allowing us to do more work in less time.
p221
aVThere is no economic law
p222
aVthat says that we will use that wealth well,
p223
aVand that is worth worrying about.
p224
aVConsider two countries,
p225
aVNorway and Saudi Arabia.
p226
aVBoth oil-rich nations,
p227
aVit's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VBut they haven't used that wealth equally well to foster human prosperity,
p232
aVhuman prospering.
p233
aVNorway is a thriving democracy.
p234
aVBy and large, its citizens work and play well together.
p235
aVIt's typically numbered between first and fourth
p236
aVin rankings of national happiness.
p237
aVSaudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy
p238
aVin which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement.
p239
aVIt's typically ranked 35th among nations in happiness,
p240
aVwhich is low for such a wealthy nation.
p241
aVJust by way of comparison,
p242
aVthe US is typically ranked around 12th or 13th.
p243
aVThe difference between these two countries
p244
aVis not their wealth
p245
aVand it's not their technology.
p246
aVIt's their institutions.
p247
aVNorway has invested to build a society
p248
aVwith opportunity and economic mobility.
p249
aVSaudi Arabia has raised living standards
p250
aVwhile frustrating many other human strivings.
p251
aVTwo countries, both wealthy,
p252
aVnot equally well off.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd this brings me to the challenge that we face today,
p255
aVthe challenge that automation poses for us.
p256
aVThe challenge is not that we're running out of work.
p257
aVThe US has added 14 million jobs
p258
aVsince the depths of the Great Recession.
p259
aVThe challenge is that many of those jobs
p260
aVare not good jobs,
p261
aVand many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs
p262
aVthat are being created.
p263
aVEmployment growth in the United States and in much of the developed world
p264
aVlooks something like a barbell
p265
aVwith increasing poundage on either end of the bar.
p266
aVOn the one hand,
p267
aVyou have high-education, high-wage jobs
p268
aVlike doctors and nurses, programmers and engineers,
p269
aVmarketing and sales managers.
p270
aVEmployment is robust in these jobs, employment growth.
p271
aVSimilarly, employment growth is robust in many low-skill,
p272
aVlow-education jobs like food service,
p273
aVcleaning, security,
p274
aVhome health aids.
p275
aVSimultaneously, employment is shrinking
p276
aVin many middle-education, middle-wage, middle-class jobs,
p277
aVlike blue-collar production and operative positions
p278
aVand white-collar clerical and sales positions.
p279
aVThe reasons behind this contracting middle
p280
aVare not mysterious.
p281
aVMany of those middle-skill jobs
p282
aVuse well-understood rules and procedures
p283
aVthat can increasingly be codified in software
p284
aVand executed by computers.
p285
aVThe challenge that this phenomenon creates,
p286
aVwhat economists call employment polarization,
p287
aVis that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder,
p288
aVshrinks the size of the middle class
p289
aVand threatens to make us a more stratified society.
p290
aVOn the one hand, a set of highly paid, highly educated professionals
p291
aVdoing interesting work,
p292
aVon the other, a large number of citizens in low-paid jobs
p293
aVwhose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent.
p294
aVThat is not my vision of progress,
p295
aVand I doubt that it is yours.
p296
aa(lp297
VBut here is some encouraging news.
p298
aVWe have faced equally momentous economic transformations in the past,
p299
aVand we have come through them successfully.
p300
aVIn the late 1800s and early 1900s,
p301
aVwhen automation was eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs \u2014
p302
aVremember that tractor? \u2014
p303
aVthe farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment,
p304
aVa generation of youth no longer needed on the farm
p305
aVbut not prepared for industry.
p306
aVRising to this challenge,
p307
aVthey took the radical step
p308
aVof requiring that their entire youth population
p309
aVremain in school and continue their education
p310
aVto the ripe old age of 16.
p311
aVThis was called the high school movement,
p312
aVand it was a radically expensive thing to do.
p313
aVNot only did they have to invest in the schools,
p314
aVbut those kids couldn't work at their jobs.
p315
aVIt also turned out to be one of the best investments
p316
aVthe US made in the 20th century.
p317
aVIt gave us the most skilled, the most flexible
p318
aVand the most productive workforce in the world.
p319
aVTo see how well this worked, imagine taking the labor force of 1899
p320
aVand bringing them into the present.
p321
aVDespite their strong backs and good characters,
p322
aVmany of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills
p323
aVto do all but the most mundane jobs.
p324
aVMany of them would be unemployable.
p325
aa(lp326
VWhat this example highlights is the primacy of our institutions,
p327
aVmost especially our schools,
p328
aVin allowing us to reap the harvest
p329
aVof our technological prosperity.
p330
aa(lp331
VIt's foolish to say there's nothing to worry about.
p332
aVClearly we can get this wrong.
p333
aVIf the US had not invested in its schools and in its skills
p334
aVa century ago with the high school movement,
p335
aVwe would be a less prosperous,
p336
aVa less mobile and probably a lot less happy society.
p337
aVBut it's equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed.
p338
aVThat's not decided by the machines.
p339
aVIt's not even decided by the market.
p340
aVIt's decided by us and by our institutions.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, I started this talk with a paradox.
p343
aVOur machines increasingly do our work for us.
p344
aVWhy doesn't that make our labor superfluous,
p345
aVour skills redundant?
p346
aVIsn't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell
p347
aVis paved with our own great inventions?
p348
aa(lp349
VHistory has repeatedly offered an answer to that paradox.
p350
aVThe first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage,
p351
aVincreases the importance, the added value
p352
aVof our expertise, our judgment and our creativity.
p353
aVThat's the O-ring.
p354
aVThe second part of the answer is our endless inventiveness
p355
aVand bottomless desires
p356
aVmeans that we never get enough, never get enough.
p357
aVThere's always new work to do.
p358
aVAdjusting to the rapid pace of technological change
p359
aVcreates real challenges,
p360
aVseen most clearly in our polarized labor market
p361
aVand the threat that it poses to economic mobility.
p362
aVRising to this challenge is not automatic.
p363
aVIt's not costless.
p364
aVIt's not easy.
p365
aVBut it is feasible.
p366
aVAnd here is some encouraging news.
p367
aVBecause of our amazing productivity,
p368
aVwe're rich.
p369
aVOf course we can afford to invest in ourselves and in our children
p370
aVas America did a hundred years ago with the high school movement.
p371
aVArguably, we can't afford not to.
p372
aa(lp373
VNow, you may be thinking,
p374
aVProfessor Autor has told us a heartwarming tale
p375
aVabout the distant past,
p376
aVthe recent past,
p377
aVmaybe the present, but probably not the future.
p378
aVBecause everybody knows that this time is different.
p379
aVRight? Is this time different?
p380
aVOf course this time is different.
p381
aVEvery time is different.
p382
aVOn numerous occasions in the last 200 years,
p383
aVscholars and activists have raised the alarm
p384
aVthat we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete:
p385
aVfor example, the Luddites in the early 1800s;
p386
aVUS Secretary of Labor James Davis
p387
aVin the mid-1920s;
p388
aVNobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief in 1982;
p389
aVand of course, many scholars,
p390
aVpundits, technologists
p391
aVand media figures today.
p392
aa(lp393
VThese predictions strike me as arrogant.
p394
aVThese self-proclaimed oracles are in effect saying,
p395
aV"If I can't think of what people will do for work in the future,
p396
aVthen you, me and our kids
p397
aVaren't going to think of it either."
p398
aVI don't have the guts
p399
aVto take that bet against human ingenuity.
p400
aVLook, I can't tell you what people are going to do for work
p401
aVa hundred years from now.
p402
aVBut the future doesn't hinge on my imagination.
p403
aVIf I were a farmer in Iowa in the year 1900,
p404
aVand an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field
p405
aVand said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,
p406
aVin the next hundred years,
p407
aVagricultural employment is going to fall from 40 percent of all jobs
p408
aVto two percent
p409
aVpurely due to rising productivity.
p410
aVWhat do you think the other 38 percent of workers are going to do?"
p411
aVI would not have said, "Oh, we got this.
p412
aVWe'll do app development, radiological medicine,
p413
aVyoga instruction, Bitmoji."
p414
aa(lp415
V(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VI wouldn't have had a clue.
p418
aVBut I hope I would have had the wisdom to say,
p419
aV"Wow, a 95 percent reduction in farm employment
p420
aVwith no shortage of food.
p421
aVThat's an amazing amount of progress.
p422
aVI hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do
p423
aVwith all of that prosperity."
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd by and large, I would say that it has.
p426
aa(lp427
