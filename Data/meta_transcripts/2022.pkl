VI need to start by telling you a little bit
p4
aVabout my social life,
p5
aVwhich I know may not seem relevant,
p6
aVbut it is.
p7
aa(lp8
VWhen people meet me at parties
p9
aVand they find out that I'm an English professor
p10
aVwho specializes in language,
p11
aVthey generally have one of two reactions.
p12
aVOne set of people look frightened. (Laughter)
p13
aVThey often say something like,
p14
aV"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.
p15
aVI'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."
p16
aVAnd then they stop talking. (Laughter)
p17
aVAnd they wait for me to go away
p18
aVand talk to someone else.
p19
aVThe other set of people,
p20
aVtheir eyes light up,
p21
aVand they say,
p22
aV"You are just the person I want to talk to."
p23
aVAnd then they tell me about whatever it is
p24
aVthey think is going wrong with the English language.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VA couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party
p28
aVand the man to my right
p29
aVstarted telling me about all the ways
p30
aVthat the Internet is degrading the English language.
p31
aVHe brought up Facebook, and he said,
p32
aV"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"
p33
aa(lp34
VI want to pause on that question:
p35
aVWhat makes a word real?
p36
aVMy dinner companion and I both know
p37
aVwhat the verb "defriend" means,
p38
aVso when does a new word like "defriend"
p39
aVbecome real?
p40
aVWho has the authority to make those kinds
p41
aVof official decisions about words, anyway?
p42
aVThose are the questions I want to talk about today.
p43
aa(lp44
VI think most people, when they say a word isn't real,
p45
aVwhat they mean is, it doesn't appear
p46
aVin a standard dictionary.
p47
aVThat, of course, raises a host of other questions,
p48
aVincluding, who writes dictionaries?
p49
aa(lp50
VBefore I go any further,
p51
aVlet me clarify my role in all of this.
p52
aVI do not write dictionaries.
p53
aVI do, however, collect new words
p54
aVmuch the way dictionary editors do,
p55
aVand the great thing about being a historian
p56
aVof the English language
p57
aVis that I get to call this "research."
p58
aVWhen I teach the history of the English language,
p59
aVI require that students teach me
p60
aVtwo new slang words before I will begin class.
p61
aVOver the years, I have learned
p62
aVsome great new slang this way,
p63
aVincluding "hangry," which \u2014
p64
aV(Applause) \u2014
p65
aVwhich is when you are cranky or angry
p66
aVbecause you are hungry,
p67
aVand "adorkable,"
p68
aVwhich is when you are adorable
p69
aVin kind of a dorky way,
p70
aVclearly, terrific words that fill
p71
aVimportant gaps in the English language.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVBut how real are they
p74
aVif we use them primarily as slang
p75
aVand they don't yet appear in a dictionary?
p76
aa(lp77
VWith that, let's turn to dictionaries.
p78
aVI'm going to do this as a show of hands:
p79
aVHow many of you still regularly
p80
aVrefer to a dictionary, either print or online?
p81
aVOkay, so that looks like most of you.
p82
aVNow, a second question. Again, a show of hands:
p83
aVHow many of you have ever looked to see
p84
aVwho edited the dictionary you are using?
p85
aVOkay, many fewer.
p86
aVAt some level, we know that there are human hands
p87
aVbehind dictionaries,
p88
aVbut we're really not sure who those hands belong to.
p89
aVI'm actually fascinated by this.
p90
aVEven the most critical people out there
p91
aVtend not to be very critical about dictionaries,
p92
aVnot distinguishing among them
p93
aVand not asking a whole lot of questions
p94
aVabout who edited them.
p95
aVJust think about the phrase
p96
aV"Look it up in the dictionary,"
p97
aVwhich suggests that all dictionaries
p98
aVare exactly the same.
p99
aVConsider the library here on campus,
p100
aVwhere you go into the reading room,
p101
aVand there is a large, unabridged dictionary
p102
aVup on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect
p103
aVlying open so we can go stand before it
p104
aVto get answers.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, don't get me wrong,
p107
aVdictionaries are fantastic resources,
p108
aVbut they are human
p109
aVand they are not timeless.
p110
aVI'm struck as a teacher
p111
aVthat we tell students to critically question
p112
aVevery text they read, every website they visit,
p113
aVexcept dictionaries,
p114
aVwhich we tend to treat as un-authored,
p115
aVas if they came from nowhere to give us answers
p116
aVabout what words really mean.
p117
aVHere's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,
p118
aVwhat they'll tell you
p119
aVis they're just trying to keep up with us
p120
aVas we change the language.
p121
aVThey're watching what we say and what we write
p122
aVand trying to figure out what's going to stick
p123
aVand what's not going to stick.
p124
aVThey have to gamble,
p125
aVbecause they want to appear cutting edge
p126
aVand catch the words that are going to make it,
p127
aVsuch as LOL,
p128
aVbut they don't want to appear faddish
p129
aVand include the words that aren't going to make it,
p130
aVand I think a word that they're watching right now
p131
aVis YOLO, you only live once.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow I get to hang out with dictionary editors,
p134
aVand you might be surprised
p135
aVby one of the places where we hang out.
p136
aVEvery January, we go
p137
aVto the American Dialect Society annual meeting,
p138
aVwhere among other things,
p139
aVwe vote on the word of the year.
p140
aVThere are about 200 or 300 people who come,
p141
aVsome of the best known linguists in the United States.
p142
aVTo give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,
p143
aVit occurs right before happy hour.
p144
aVAnyone who comes can vote.
p145
aVThe most important rule is
p146
aVthat you can vote with only one hand.
p147
aVIn the past, some of the winners have been
p148
aV"tweet" in 2009
p149
aVand "hashtag" in 2012.
p150
aV"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,
p151
aVbecause who knew what a chad was before 2000,
p152
aVand "WMD" in 2002.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, we have other categories in which we vote too,
p155
aVand my favorite category
p156
aVis most creative word of the year.
p157
aVPast winners in this category have included
p158
aV"recombobulation area,"
p159
aVwhich is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,
p160
aVwhere you can recombobulate.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVYou can put your belt back on,
p163
aVput your computer back in your bag.
p164
aVAnd then my all-time favorite word at this vote,
p165
aVwhich is "multi-slacking."
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aVAnd multi-slacking is the act
p168
aVof having multiple windows up on your screen
p169
aVso it looks like you're working
p170
aVwhen you're actually goofing around on the web.
p171
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VWill all of these words stick? Absolutely not.
p174
aVAnd we have made some questionable choices,
p175
aVfor example in 2006
p176
aVwhen the word of the year was "Plutoed,"
p177
aVto mean demoted.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVBut some of the past winners
p180
aVnow seem completely unremarkable,
p181
aVsuch as "app"
p182
aVand "e" as a prefix,
p183
aVand "google" as a verb.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, a few weeks before our vote,
p186
aVLake Superior State University
p187
aVissues its list of banished words for the year.
p188
aVWhat is striking about this
p189
aVis that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap
p190
aVbetween their list and the list that we are considering
p191
aVfor words of the year,
p192
aVand this is because we're noticing the same thing.
p193
aVWe're noticing words that are coming into prominence.
p194
aVIt's really a question of attitude.
p195
aVAre you bothered by language fads and language change,
p196
aVor do you find it fun, interesting,
p197
aVsomething worthy of study
p198
aVas part of a living language?
p199
aa(lp200
VThe list by Lake Superior State University
p201
aVcontinues a fairly long tradition in English
p202
aVof complaints about new words.
p203
aVSo here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,
p204
aVwho was very concerned that "desirability"
p205
aVis really a terrible word.
p206
aVIn 1760, Benjamin Franklin
p207
aVwrote a letter to David Hume
p208
aVgiving up the word "colonize" as bad.
p209
aa(lp210
VOver the years, we've also seen worries
p211
aVabout new pronunciations.
p212
aVHere is Samuel Rogers in 1855
p213
aVwho is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations
p214
aVthat he finds offensive,
p215
aVand he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,
p216
aVbalcony makes me sick."
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aVThe word is borrowed in from Italian
p219
aVand it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.
p220
aa(lp221
VThese complaints now strike us as quaint,
p222
aVif not downright adorkable \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p223
aVbut here's the thing:
p224
aVwe still get quite worked up about language change.
p225
aVI have an entire file in my office
p226
aVof newspaper articles
p227
aVwhich express concern about illegitimate words
p228
aVthat should not have been included in the dictionary,
p229
aVincluding "LOL"
p230
aVwhen it got into the Oxford English Dictionary
p231
aVand "defriend"
p232
aVwhen it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.
p233
aVI also have articles expressing concern
p234
aVabout "invite" as a noun,
p235
aV"impact" as a verb,
p236
aVbecause only teeth can be impacted,
p237
aVand "incentivize" is described
p238
aVas "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, it's not that dictionary editors
p241
aVignore these kinds of attitudes about language.
p242
aVThey try to provide us some guidance about words
p243
aVthat are considered slang or informal
p244
aVor offensive, often through usage labels,
p245
aVbut they're in something of a bind,
p246
aVbecause they're trying to describe what we do,
p247
aVand they know that we often go to dictionaries
p248
aVto get information about how we should use a word
p249
aVwell or appropriately.
p250
aVIn response, the American Heritage Dictionaries
p251
aVinclude usage notes.
p252
aVUsage notes tend to occur with words
p253
aVthat are troublesome in one way,
p254
aVand one of the ways that they can be troublesome
p255
aVis that they're changing meaning.
p256
aVNow usage notes involve very human decisions,
p257
aVand I think, as dictionary users,
p258
aVwe're often not as aware of those human decisions
p259
aVas we should be.
p260
aVTo show you what I mean,
p261
aVwe'll look at an example, but before we do,
p262
aVI want to explain what the dictionary editors
p263
aVare trying to deal with in this usage note.
p264
aa(lp265
VThink about the word "peruse"
p266
aVand how you use that word.
p267
aVI would guess many of you are thinking
p268
aVof skim, scan, reading quickly.
p269
aVSome of you may even have some walking involved,
p270
aVbecause you're perusing grocery store shelves,
p271
aVor something like that.
p272
aVYou might be surprised to learn
p273
aVthat if you look in most standard dictionaries,
p274
aVthe first definition will be to read carefully,
p275
aVor pore over.
p276
aVAmerican Heritage has that as the first definition.
p277
aVThey then have, as the second definition, skim,
p278
aVand next to that, they say "usage problem."
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVAnd then they include a usage note,
p281
aVwhich is worth looking at.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo here's the usage note:
p284
aV"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...
p285
aVBut the word is often used more loosely,
p286
aVto mean simply 'to read.'...
p287
aVFurther extension of the word to mean 'to glance over, skim,'
p288
aVhas traditionally been considered an error,
p289
aVbut our ballot results suggest that it is becoming
p290
aVsomewhat more acceptable.
p291
aVWhen asked about the sentence,
p292
aV'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'
p293
aV66 percent of the [Usage] Panel
p294
aVfound it unacceptable in 1988,
p295
aV58 percent in 1999,
p296
aVand 48 percent in 2011."
p297
aa(lp298
VAh, the Usage Panel,
p299
aVthat trusted body of language authorities
p300
aVwho is getting more lenient about this.
p301
aVNow, what I hope you're thinking right now is,
p302
aV"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?
p303
aVAnd what should I do with their pronouncements?"
p304
aVIf you look in the front matter
p305
aVof American Heritage Dictionaries,
p306
aVyou can actually find the names
p307
aVof the people on the Usage Panel.
p308
aVBut who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?
p309
aVThere are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.
p310
aVThey include academicians,
p311
aVjournalists, creative writers.
p312
aVThere's a Supreme Court justice on it
p313
aVand a few linguists.
p314
aVAs of 2005, the list includes me.
p315
aV(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VHere's what we can do for you.
p318
aVWe can give you a sense
p319
aVof the range of opinions about contested usage.
p320
aVThat is and should be the extent of our authority.
p321
aVWe are not a language academy.
p322
aVAbout once a year, I get a ballot
p323
aVthat asks me about whether new uses,
p324
aVnew pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow here's what I do to fill out the ballot.
p327
aVI listen to what other people are saying and writing.
p328
aVI do not listen to my own likes
p329
aVand dislikes about the English language.
p330
aVI will be honest with you:
p331
aVI do not like the word "impactful,"
p332
aVbut that is neither here nor there
p333
aVin terms of whether "impactful" is becoming common usage
p334
aVand becoming more acceptable in written prose.
p335
aVSo to be responsible,
p336
aVwhat I do is go look at usage,
p337
aVwhich often involves going to look
p338
aVat online databases such as Google Books.
p339
aVWell, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,
p340
aVhere is what you find.
p341
aVWell, it sure looks like "impactful"
p342
aVis proving useful
p343
aVfor a certain number of writers,
p344
aVand has become more and more useful
p345
aVover the last 20 years.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow, there are going to be changes
p348
aVthat all of us don't like in the language.
p349
aVThere are going to be changes where you think,
p350
aV"Really?
p351
aVDoes the language have to change that way?"
p352
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p353
aVwe should be less quick
p354
aVto decide that that change is terrible,
p355
aVwe should be less quick to impose
p356
aVour likes and dislikes about words on other people,
p357
aVand we should be entirely reluctant
p358
aVto think that the English language is in trouble.
p359
aVIt's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled
p360
aVwith the creativity of the speakers who speak it.
p361
aVIn retrospect, we think it's fascinating
p362
aVthat the word "nice" used to mean silly,
p363
aVand that the word "decimate"
p364
aVused to mean to kill one in every 10.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVWe think that Ben Franklin was being silly
p367
aVto worry about "notice" as a verb.
p368
aVWell, you know what?
p369
aVWe're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years
p370
aVfor worrying about "impact" as a verb
p371
aVand "invite" as a noun.
p372
aVThe language is not going to change so fast
p373
aVthat we can't keep up.
p374
aVLanguage just doesn't work that way.
p375
aVI hope that what you can do
p376
aVis find language change not worrisome
p377
aVbut fun and fascinating,
p378
aVjust the way dictionary editors do.
p379
aVI hope you can enjoy being part
p380
aVof the creativity that is continually remaking
p381
aVour language and keeping it robust.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo how does a word get into a dictionary?
p384
aVIt gets in because we use it
p385
aVand we keep using it,
p386
aVand dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
p387
aVIf you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide
p388
aVwhat words mean,"
p389
aVI would say, "Yes it does,
p390
aVand it always has."
p391
aVDictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,
p392
aVbut there is no objective dictionary authority out there
p393
aVthat is the final arbiter about what words mean.
p394
aVIf a community of speakers is using a word
p395
aVand knows what it means, it's real.
p396
aVThat word might be slangy,
p397
aVthat word might be informal,
p398
aVthat word might be a word that you think
p399
aVis illogical or unnecessary,
p400
aVbut that word that we're using,
p401
aVthat word is real.
p402
