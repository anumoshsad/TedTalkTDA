(lp3
VTwo hundred years of modern science.
p4
aVWe have to admit
p5
aVthat our performance is not great.
p6
aVThe machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures.
p7
aVThe houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes.
p8
aVBut we shouldn't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason:
p9
aVthey didn't have much time.
p10
aVTwo hundred years is not a lot of time,
p11
aVwhile nature had three billion years
p12
aVto perfect some of the most amazing materials,
p13
aVthat we wish we had in our possession.
p14
aVRemember, these materials carry a quality assurance
p15
aVof three billion years.
p16
aa(lp17
VTake, for example, sequoia trees.
p18
aVThey carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years
p19
aVin cold weather, in warm climates,
p20
aVUV light.
p21
aVYet, if you look at the structure by high-resolution electron microscopy,
p22
aVand you ask yourself, what is it made of,
p23
aVsurprisingly, it's made of sugar.
p24
aVWell, not exactly as we drink in our tea.
p25
aVIt's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose.
p26
aVAnd this nanocrystalline cellulose is so strong, on a weight basis,
p27
aVit's about 10 times stronger than steel.
p28
aVYet it's made of sugar.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose
p31
aVis going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry.
p32
aVBut here's the problem:
p33
aVsay you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose
p34
aVto build a boat or an airplane.
p35
aVWell, you can Google, you can eBay, you can even Alibaba.
p36
aVYou won't find it.
p37
aVOf course, you're going to find thousands of scientific papers \u2014
p38
aVgreat papers, where scientists are going to say this is a great material,
p39
aVthere are lots of things we can do with it.
p40
aVBut no commercial source.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo we at the Hebrew University, together with our partners in Sweden,
p43
aVdecided to focus on the development of an industrial-scale process
p44
aVto produce this nanocellulose.
p45
aVAnd, of course, we didn't want to cut trees.
p46
aVSo we were looking for another source
p47
aVof raw material,
p48
aVand we found one \u2014 in fact, the sludge of the paper industry.
p49
aVThe reason: there is a lot of it.
p50
aVEurope alone produces 11 million tons
p51
aVof that material annually.
p52
aVIt's the equivalent of a mountain three kilometers high,
p53
aVsitting on a soccer field.
p54
aVAnd we produce this mountain every year.
p55
aVSo for everybody, it's an environmental problem,
p56
aVand for us, it's a gold mine.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo now, we are actually producing, on an industrial scale in Israel,
p59
aVnanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.
p60
aVWe can do a lot of things with the material.
p61
aVFor example,
p62
aVwe have shown that by adding only a small percent of nanocellulose
p63
aVinto cotton fibers, the same as my shirt is made of,
p64
aVit increases its strength dramatically.
p65
aVSo this can be used for making amazing things,
p66
aVlike super-fabrics for industrial and medical applications.
p67
aVBut this is not the only thing.
p68
aVFor example, self-standing, self-supporting structures,
p69
aVlike the shelters that you can see now,
p70
aVactually are now showcasing in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.
p71
aa(lp72
VNature actually didn't stop its wonders
p73
aVin the plant kingdom.
p74
aVThink about insects.
p75
aVCat fleas, for example,
p76
aVhave the ability to jump about a hundred times their height.
p77
aVThat's amazing.
p78
aVIt's the equivalent of a person
p79
aVstanding in the middle of Liberty Island in New York,
p80
aVand in a single jump,
p81
aVgoing to the top of the Statue of Liberty.
p82
aVI'm sure everybody would like to do that.
p83
aVSo the question is:
p84
aVHow do cat fleas do it?
p85
aa(lp86
VIt turns out, they make this wonderful material,
p87
aVwhich is called resilin.
p88
aVIn simple words, resilin, which is a protein,
p89
aVis the most elastic rubber on Earth.
p90
aVYou can stretch it,
p91
aVyou can squish it,
p92
aVand it doesn't lose almost any energy to the environment.
p93
aVWhen you release it \u2014 snap!
p94
aVIt brings back all the energy.
p95
aVSo I'm sure everybody would like to have that material.
p96
aVBut here's the problem:
p97
aVto catch cat fleas is difficult.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VWhy? Because they are jumpy.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VBut now, it's actually enough to catch one.
p106
aVNow we can extract its DNA
p107
aVand read how cat fleas make the resilin,
p108
aVand clone it into a less-jumpy organism like a plant.
p109
aVSo that's exactly what we did.
p110
aVNow we have the ability to produce lots of resilin.
p111
aa(lp112
VWell, my team decided to do something really cool at the university.
p113
aVThey decided to combine
p114
aVthe strongest material produced by the plant kingdom
p115
aVwith the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom \u2014
p116
aVnanocellulose with resilin.
p117
aVAnd the result is amazing.
p118
aVThis material, in fact, is tough, elastic and transparent.
p119
aVSo there are lots of things that can be done with this material.
p120
aVFor example, next-generation sport shoes,
p121
aVso we can jump higher, run faster.
p122
aVAnd even touch screens for computers and smartphones,
p123
aVthat won't break.
p124
aa(lp125
VWell, the problem is, we continue to implant
p126
aVsynthetic implants in our body,
p127
aVwhich we glue and screw into our body.
p128
aVAnd I'm going to say that this is not a good idea.
p129
aVWhy? Because they fail.
p130
aVThis synthetic material fails,
p131
aVjust like this plastic fork,
p132
aVthat is not strong enough for its performance.
p133
aVBut sometimes they are too strong,
p134
aVand therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit
p135
aVtheir surrounding tissues.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut in fact, the reason is much more fundamental.
p138
aVThe reason is that in nature,
p139
aVthere is no one there
p140
aVthat actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck,
p141
aVor takes my skin and glues it onto my body.
p142
aVIn nature, everything is self-assembled.
p143
aVSo every living cell,
p144
aVwhether coming from a plant, insect or human being,
p145
aVhas a DNA that encodes for nanobio building blocks.
p146
aVMany times they are proteins.
p147
aVOther times, they are enzymes that make other materials,
p148
aVlike polysaccharides, fatty acids.
p149
aVAnd the common feature about all these materials
p150
aVis that they need no one.
p151
aVThey recognize each other and self-assemble
p152
aVinto structures \u2014 scaffolds on which cells are proliferating
p153
aVto give tissues.
p154
aVThey develop into organs, and together bring life.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo we at the Hebrew University, about 10 years ago, decided to focus
p157
aVon probably the most important biomaterial for humans,
p158
aVwhich is collagen.
p159
aVWhy collagen?
p160
aVBecause collagen accounts for about 25 percent of our dry weight.
p161
aVWe have nothing more than collagen, other than water, in our body.
p162
aVSo I always like to say,
p163
aVanyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings
p164
aVwould like to have collagen.
p165
aa(lp166
VAdmittedly, before we started our project,
p167
aVthere were already more than 1,000 medical implants
p168
aVmade of collagen.
p169
aVYou know, simple things like dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,
p170
aVaugment lips,
p171
aVand other, more sophisticated medical implants, like heart valves.
p172
aVSo where is the problem?
p173
aVWell, the problem is the source.
p174
aVThe source of all that collagen
p175
aVis actually coming from dead bodies:
p176
aVdead pigs, dead cows
p177
aVand even human cadavers.
p178
aVSo safety is a big issue.
p179
aVBut it's not the only one.
p180
aVAlso, the quality.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow here, I have a personal interest.
p183
aVThis is my father, Zvi, in our winery in Israel.
p184
aVA heart valve, very similar to the one that I showed you before,
p185
aVseven years ago, was implanted in his body.
p186
aVNow, the scientific literature says that these heart valves start to fail
p187
aV10 years after the operation.
p188
aVNo wonder:
p189
aVthey are made from old, used tissues,
p190
aVjust like this wall made of bricks that is falling apart.
p191
aVYeah, of course, I can take those bricks and build a new wall.
p192
aVBut it's not going to be the same.
p193
aVSo the US Food and Drug Administration
p194
aVmade a notice already in 2007,
p195
aVasking the companies to start to look for better alternatives.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo that's exactly what we did.
p198
aVWe decided to clone all the five human genes responsible
p199
aVfor making type I collagen in humans
p200
aVinto a transgenic tobacco plant.
p201
aVSo now, the plant has the ability to make human collagen brand new,
p202
aVuntouched.
p203
aVThis is amazing.
p204
aVActually, it's happening now.
p205
aVToday in Israel, we grow it in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses
p206
aVall over the country.
p207
aVThe farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco.
p208
aVIt looks exactly like regular tobacco,
p209
aVexcept that they have five human genes.
p210
aVThey're responsible for making type I collagen.
p211
aVWe grow them for about 50 to 70 days,
p212
aVwe harvest the leaves,
p213
aVand then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory.
p214
aVThere, the process of extracting the collagen starts.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, if you ever made a pesto \u2014 essentially, the same thing.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VYou crush the leaves, you get the juice that contains the collagen.
p221
aVWe concentrate the protein,
p222
aVtransfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification,
p223
aVand the end result is a collagen identical to what we have in our body \u2014
p224
aVuntouched, brand new
p225
aVand from which we make different medical implants:
p226
aVbone void fillers, for example,
p227
aVfor severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.
p228
aVAnd more recently, even,
p229
aVwe've been able to launch into the market here in Europe
p230
aVa flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers,
p231
aVthat is now approved for use in the clinic.
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is not science fiction.
p234
aVThis is happening now.
p235
aVWe are using plants to make medical implants
p236
aVfor replacement parts for human beings.
p237
aVIn fact, more recently, we've been able to make collagen fibers
p238
aVwhich are six times stronger than the Achilles tendon.
p239
aVThat's amazing.
p240
aa(lp241
VTogether with our partners from Ireland,
p242
aVwe thought about the next thing:
p243
aVadding resilin to those fibers.
p244
aVBy doing that,
p245
aVwe've been able to make a superfiber
p246
aVwhich is about 380 percent tougher,
p247
aVand 300 percent more elastic.
p248
aVSo oddly enough, in the future,
p249
aVwhen a patient is transplanted with artificial tendons or ligaments
p250
aVmade from these fibers,
p251
aVwe'll have better performance after the surgery
p252
aVthan we had before the injury.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo what's for the future?
p255
aVIn the future, we believe we'll be able to make
p256
aVmany nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us \u2014
p257
aVcollagen, nanocellulose, resilin and many more.
p258
aVAnd that will enable us to make better machines perform better,
p259
aVeven the heart.
p260
aVNow, this heart is not going to be the same
p261
aVas we can get from a donor.
p262
aVIt will be better.
p263
aVIt actually will perform better
p264
aVand will last longer.
p265
aa(lp266
VMy friend Zion Suliman once told me
p267
aVa smart sentence.
p268
aVHe said, "If you want a new idea,
p269
aVyou should open an old book."
p270
aVAnd I'm going to say that the book was written.
p271
aVIt was written over three billion years
p272
aVof evolution.
p273
aVAnd the text is the DNA of life.
p274
aVAll we have to do
p275
aVis read this text,
p276
aVembrace nature's gift to us
p277
aVand start our progress from here.
p278
aa(lp279
