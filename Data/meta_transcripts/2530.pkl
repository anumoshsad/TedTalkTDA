VWhat an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
p4
aVto a psychologist.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI've had the opportunity over the last couple of days
p9
aVof listening in on some of your conversations
p10
aVand watching you interact with each other.
p11
aVAnd I think it's fair to say, already,
p12
aVthat there are 47 people in this audience,
p13
aVat this moment,
p14
aVdisplaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I thought you might like to know who you are.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VBut instead of pointing at you,
p23
aVwhich would be gratuitous and intrusive,
p24
aVI thought I would tell you a few facts and stories,
p25
aVin which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.
p26
aa(lp27
VI'm in the field of research known as personality psychology,
p28
aVwhich is part of a larger personality science
p29
aVwhich spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives.
p30
aVAnd what we try to do,
p31
aVin our own way,
p32
aVis to make sense of how each of us \u2014
p33
aVeach of you \u2014
p34
aVis, in certain respects,
p35
aVlike all other people,
p36
aVlike some other people
p37
aVand like no other person.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, already you may be saying of yourself,
p40
aV"I'm not intriguing.
p41
aVI am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."
p42
aVOr you may say of yourself,
p43
aV"I am intriguing,
p44
aVeven if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness"
p49
aVthat makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.
p50
aVSo let me explain why this is so.
p51
aa(lp52
VOne of the most influential approaches in personality science
p53
aVis known as trait psychology,
p54
aVand it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed,
p55
aVand that describe universally held aspects of difference between people.
p56
aVThey spell out the acronym OCEAN.
p57
aVSo, "O" stands for "open to experience,"
p58
aVversus those who are more closed.
p59
aV"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"
p60
aVin contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life.
p61
aV"E" \u2014 "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people.
p62
aV"A" \u2014 "agreeable individuals,"
p63
aVin contrast to those decidedly not agreeable.
p64
aVAnd "N" \u2014 "neurotic individuals,"
p65
aVin contrast to those who are more stable.
p66
aa(lp67
VAll of these dimensions have implications for our well-being,
p68
aVfor how our life goes.
p69
aVAnd so we know that, for example,
p70
aVopenness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success,
p71
aVbut the open people achieve that success through being audacious
p72
aVand, occasionally, odd.
p73
aVThe conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines,
p74
aVto persevering, as well as having some passion.
p75
aVExtroversion and agreeableness are both conducive
p76
aVto working well with people.
p77
aVExtroverts, for example, I find intriguing.
p78
aVWith my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact
p79
aVthat might be revealing with respect to their personality:
p80
aVI tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults
p81
aVto lick the outside of their own elbow.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VDid you know that?
p86
aVAlready, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow.
p87
aVBut extroverts amongst you
p88
aVare probably those who have not only tried,
p89
aVbut they have successfully licked the elbow
p90
aVof the person sitting next to them.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VThose are the extroverts.
p95
aa(lp96
VLet me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion,
p97
aVbecause it's consequential and it's intriguing,
p98
aVand it helps us understand what I call our three natures.
p99
aVFirst, our biogenic nature \u2014 our neurophysiology.
p100
aVSecond, our sociogenic or second nature,
p101
aVwhich has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.
p102
aVAnd third, what makes you individually you \u2014 idiosyncratic \u2014
p103
aVwhat I call your "idiogenic" nature.
p104
aa(lp105
VLet me explain.
p106
aVOne of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.
p107
aVAnd that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting:
p108
aVloud noises, parties and social events here at TED \u2014
p109
aVyou see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.
p110
aVThey all gather together.
p111
aVAnd I've seen you.
p112
aVThe introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces
p113
aVup on the second floor,
p114
aVwhere they are able to reduce stimulation \u2014
p115
aVand may be misconstrued as being antisocial,
p116
aVbut you're not necessarily antisocial.
p117
aVIt may be that you simply realize that you do better
p118
aVwhen you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.
p119
aa(lp120
VSometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.
p121
aVCaffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.
p122
aVWhen extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning
p123
aVand say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"
p124
aVthey're not kidding \u2014
p125
aVthey really do.
p126
aVIntroverts do not do as well,
p127
aVparticularly if the tasks they're engaged in \u2014
p128
aVand they've had some coffee \u2014
p129
aVif those tasks are speeded,
p130
aVand if they're quantitative,
p131
aVintroverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.
p132
aVBut it's a misconstrual.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing:
p135
aVwe're not always what seem to be,
p136
aVand that takes me to my next point.
p137
aVI should say, before getting to this,
p138
aVsomething about sexual intercourse,
p139
aValthough I may not have time.
p140
aVAnd so, if you would like me to \u2014
p141
aVyes, you would?
p142
aVOK.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThere are studies done
p147
aVon the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act,
p148
aVas broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert.
p149
aVSo I ask you:
p150
aVHow many times per minute \u2014
p151
aVoh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study \u2014
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VHow many times per month
p156
aVdo introverted men engage in the act?
p157
aV3.0.
p158
aVExtroverted men?
p159
aVMore or less?
p160
aVYes, more.
p161
aV5.5 \u2014 almost twice as much.
p162
aVIntroverted women: 3.1.
p163
aVExtroverted women?
p164
aVFrankly, speaking as an introverted male,
p165
aVwhich I will explain later \u2014
p166
aVthey are heroic.
p167
aV7.5.
p168
aVThey not only handle all the male extroverts,
p169
aVthey pick up a few introverts as well.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VWe communicate differently, extroverts and introverts.
p176
aVExtroverts, when they interact,
p177
aVwant to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness.
p178
aVThey'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.
p179
aVThey like to have a lot of eye contact,
p180
aVor mutual gaze.
p181
aVWe found in some research
p182
aVthat they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody.
p183
aVSo when an extrovert meets a Charles,
p184
aVit rapidly becomes "Charlie," and then "Chuck,"
p185
aVand then "Chuckles Baby."
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VWhereas for introverts,
p190
aVit remains "Charles," until he's given a pass to be more intimate
p191
aVby the person he's talking to.
p192
aVWe speak differently.
p193
aVExtroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language.
p194
aVIntroverts prefer \u2014 and I must again tell you
p195
aVthat I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine \u2014
p196
aVwe speak differently.
p197
aVWe prefer contextually complex,
p198
aVcontingent,
p199
aVweasel-word sentences \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VMore or less.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAs it were.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VNot to put too fine a point upon it \u2014
p212
aVlike that.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhen we talk,
p215
aVwe sometimes talk past each other.
p216
aVI had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague
p217
aVwho's as different from me as two people can possibly be.
p218
aVFirst, his name is Tom.
p219
aVMine isn't.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VSecondly, he's six foot five.
p224
aVI have a tendency not to be.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find.
p229
aVI am seriously introverted.
p230
aVI overload so much,
p231
aVI can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon
p232
aVand expect to sleep in the evening.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael.
p235
aVAnd Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt.
p236
aVSo the person who seconded him asked Tom and me,
p237
aV"What do you make of Michael?"
p238
aVWell, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.
p239
aVHe spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."
p240
aVAnd here is how extroverted ears heard what I said,
p241
aVwhich is actually pretty accurate.
p242
aVI said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times
p243
aVof behaving in a way that some of us might see
p244
aVas perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VTom rolled his eyes and he said,
p249
aV"Brian, that's what I said:
p250
aVhe's an asshole!"
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
V(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VNow, as an introvert,
p257
aVI might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities
p258
aVin this man's behavior,
p259
aVbut I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VBut the extrovert says,
p264
aV"If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."
p265
aVAnd we go past each other.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow is this something that we should be heedful of?
p268
aVOf course.
p269
aVIt's important that we know this.
p270
aVIs that all we are?
p271
aVAre we just a bunch of traits?
p272
aVNo, we're not.
p273
aVRemember, you're like some other people
p274
aVand like no other person.
p275
aVHow about that idiosyncratic you?
p276
aVAs Elizabeth or as George,
p277
aVyou may share your extroversion or your neuroticism.
p278
aVBut are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior,
p279
aVor Georgian of yours,
p280
aVthat make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits?
p281
aVThat make us love you?
p282
aVNot just because you're a certain type of person.
p283
aa(lp284
VI'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.
p285
aVI don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.
p286
aVSo what is it that makes us different?
p287
aVIt's the doings that we have in our life \u2014 the personal projects.
p288
aVYou have a personal project right now,
p289
aVbut nobody may know it here.
p290
aVIt relates to your kid \u2014
p291
aVyou've been back three times to the hospital,
p292
aVand they still don't know what's wrong.
p293
aVOr it could be your mom.
p294
aVAnd you'd been acting out of character.
p295
aVThese are free traits.
p296
aVYou're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably
p297
aVin order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor
p298
aVin the hospital,
p299
aVto get something for your mom or your child.
p300
aa(lp301
VWhat are these free traits?
p302
aVThey're where we enact a script
p303
aVin order to advance a core project in our lives.
p304
aVAnd they are what matters.
p305
aVDon't ask people what type you are;
p306
aVask them, "What are your core projects in your life?"
p307
aVAnd we enact those free traits.
p308
aVI'm an introvert,
p309
aVbut I have a core project, which is to profess.
p310
aVI'm a professor.
p311
aVAnd I adore my students,
p312
aVand I adore my field.
p313
aVAnd I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting,
p314
aVwhat I can't wait to tell them about.
p315
aVAnd so I act in an extroverted way,
p316
aVbecause at eight in the morning,
p317
aVthe students need a little bit of humor,
p318
aVa little bit of engagement to keep them going
p319
aVin arduous days of study.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut we need to be very careful
p322
aVwhen we act protractedly out of character.
p323
aVSometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.
p324
aVI find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior,
p325
aVI need to repair somewhere on my own.
p326
aVAs Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,
p327
aVin a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor
p328
aVwho was teaching at the time at Harvard,
p329
aVI sometimes go to the men's room
p330
aVto escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VI remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle,
p335
aVtrying to avoid overstimulation.
p336
aVAnd a real extrovert came in beside me \u2014 not right in my cubicle,
p337
aVbut in the next cubicle over \u2014
p338
aVand I could hear various evacuatory noises,
p339
aVwhich we hate \u2014 even our own,
p340
aVthat's why we flush during as well as after.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd then I heard this gravelly voice saying,
p345
aV"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VIf anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months,
p350
aVit's talking on the john.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VThat's where I'm going now.
p355
aVDon't follow me.
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you.
