(lp3
VFirst of all, for those of you who
p4
aVare not familiar with my work,
p5
aVI create multicultural characters,
p6
aVso characters from lots of different backgrounds.
p7
aVSo before the present is the new future,
p8
aVa bit about the past is that I grew up in a family
p9
aVthat was multi-everything \u2014 multi-racial, multi-cultural,
p10
aVblack and white, Caribbean,
p11
aVIrish-American, German-American.
p12
aVThere was Dominican music blasting from stereos.
p13
aVThere were Christians and Jews.
p14
aVThat's a long story filled with
p15
aVintrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.
p16
aVBut I was totally immersed in this world
p17
aVthat was filled with everybody,
p18
aVand then I went on to the United Nations school,
p19
aVand that just completely \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I began sort of developing these voices
p22
aVand these people,
p23
aVall of whom were loosely based on people I really know,
p24
aVand so, for example, in performing them,
p25
aVI would really try to inhabit them.
p26
aVAnd for example,
p27
aVI don't really talk like that,
p28
aVbut that was one of my people,
p29
aVand I'm going to bring a few of my friends \u2014
p30
aVI think of them as my friends \u2014
p31
aVto this stage, in this spirit of the idea
p32
aVthat the present is the new future,
p33
aVin sort of a meta way,
p34
aVbecause I thought about it, and the future, for me,
p35
aVwhat can be so frightening
p36
aVis that I don't know what's coming.
p37
aVI don't know if that's true for other people,
p38
aVbut that notion of thinking about
p39
aVhow we can understand the future
p40
aVand predict outcomes,
p41
aVfor me, it's terrifying to not know what might be coming.
p42
aVAnd so the idea that there are questions
p43
aVthat I've never seen
p44
aVthat my people are going to answer,
p45
aVand some of these characters have been with me for ages,
p46
aVsome of them don't even have names,
p47
aVI don't know what's going to happen.
p48
aVI don't know what's coming,
p49
aVand all I can do is remind myself
p50
aVthat I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,
p51
aVand now that I'm up here it sort of feels like
p52
aVthat dream where you don't have any pants on,
p53
aVand so I suppose I'm going to be
p54
aVflying by the seat of my ass.
p55
aa(lp56
VThat said, let's just see who comes out.
p57
aVMay we have the first question:
p58
aa(lp59
V"Do you ever get headaches
p60
aVfrom the microchips implanted in your brain?"
p61
aVRight.
p62
aa(lp63
VOkay.
p64
aVWell first of all, I'll just say
p65
aVthat I hope you can hear me okay.
p66
aVMy name is Lorraine Levine,
p67
aVand the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,
p68
aVfrankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me
p69
aVof thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.
p70
aVNo offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,
p71
aVbut at my age,
p72
aVjust putting on the regular ones I have
p73
aValready gives me too much information.
p74
aVDo you understand what I'm saying to you?
p75
aVI don't need to know more. I don't want to know.
p76
aVThat's it. That's enough.
p77
aVI love you all. You're wonderful.
p78
aVIt's fabulous to be here with such big machers
p79
aVagain this year. Mwah!
p80
aa(lp81
VOkay, next question. (Applause)
p82
aVNext, please.
p83
aa(lp84
V"Is dating boring,
p85
aVnow that humans reproduce asexually?"
p86
aa(lp87
VWho do we got?
p88
aa(lp89
VHi, um, okay, hi everybody.
p90
aVMy name is Nereida.
p91
aVI just want to say first of all
p92
aVthat dating is never boring under any circumstance.
p93
aVBut I am very excited to be here right now,
p94
aVso I am just trying to remind myself that,
p95
aVyou know, like, the purpose of being here and everything,
p96
aVI mean, trying to answer these questions, it is very exciting.
p97
aVBut I also, I just need to acknowledge
p98
aVthat TED is an incredible experience right now
p99
aVin the present, like, I just need to say, like,
p100
aVIsabel Allende. Isabel Allende!
p101
aVOkay, maybe it doesn't mean,
p102
aVof course it means something to you,
p103
aVbut to me, it's like, another level, okay?
p104
aVBecause I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact
p105
aVthat there are role models here that I can really,
p106
aVI don't know, I just need to say that.
p107
aVThat's incredible to me, and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that,
p108
aVI just need to, like, say some affirmations
p109
aVthat can help me.
p110
aVI usually just try to use, like, the three little words
p111
aVthat always make me feel better:
p112
aVSotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)
p113
aVJust, it really helps me to get grounded.
p114
aVNow I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,
p115
aVand, you know, I just need to say it, like,
p116
aVit's so incredible to be here, and I knew that we were going to have these questions.
p117
aVI was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God,
p118
aVand reminding me, because I've had, like, some very,
p119
aVespecially since the last time we were here at TED,
p120
aVit was, like, unbelievable,
p121
aVand then right after that, like,
p122
aVso many crazy things happened, like,
p123
aVwe ended up going to the White House to perform.
p124
aVThat was, like, amazing,
p125
aVand I'm standing there,
p126
aVand I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."
p127
aVDon't say, "Oh my God."
p128
aVAnd I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."
p129
aVAnd, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,
p130
aVPresident Obama has to come up here at the same podium,
p131
aVand I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."
p132
aVIt's like, the separation of church and state.
p133
aVIt's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.
p134
aVIt was really too much.
p135
aVSo I think I've lost my way.
p136
aVBut what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,
p137
aVyou know, as far as I'm concerned,
p138
aVhowever you reproduce, as long as you're enjoying yourself
p139
aVand it's with another consenting asexual \u2014 I don't know.
p140
aVYou know where I'm going with that.
p141
aVOkay, ciao, gracias.
p142
aa(lp143
VOkay, next question. (Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VWhat are your top five favorite songs right now?
p146
aa(lp147
VAll right, well first of all, I'mma say,
p148
aVyou know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now.
p149
aVMy name is Rashid,
p150
aVand I never been at TED before,
p151
aVyou know what I'm saying.
p152
aVI think, Sarah Jones, maybe she didn't want me to come out last time.
p153
aVI don't know why. You know what I'm saying.
p154
aVObviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.
p155
aVYou know what I'm saying.
p156
aVFirst of all, that I'm in hip hop, you know what I'm saying.
p157
aVI know some of y'all may be not really
p158
aVas much into the music,
p159
aVbut the first way y'all can always know,
p160
aVyou know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop,
p161
aVis 'cos I hold the microphone
p162
aVin an official emcee posture.
p163
aVY'all can see that right there.
p164
aVThat's how you hold it.
p165
aVAll right, so you get your little tutorial right there.
p166
aVBut when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here,
p167
aVI was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,
p168
aVTED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,
p169
aVyou know what I'm saying, shit going on and everything,
p170
aVbut she was like, yeah,
p171
aVwe're going to have to answer, like, some random questions,
p172
aVjust like, and I was like, what the hell is that?
p173
aVYou know what I'm saying, just stand up there
p174
aVand answer some random questions?
p175
aVI don't want to,
p176
aVI mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.
p177
aVYou know what I'm saying? (Laughter)
p178
aVI don't want to be standing up there just
p179
aVall getting interrogated and whatnot.
p180
aVThat's what I'm trying to leave behind
p181
aVin New York. You know what I'm saying?
p182
aVSo anyway, I would have to say my top five songs right now
p183
aVis all out of my own personal catalogue,
p184
aVyou know what I mean?
p185
aVSo if you want to know more about that,
p186
aVyou know what I'm saying,
p187
aVwe could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,
p188
aVbut as far as I'm concerned,
p189
aVyou know, I believe in creative commons,
p190
aVand I think it's really important that, you know,
p191
aVthat needs to be sustainable and everything,
p192
aVand I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
p193
aVI mean, this right here,
p194
aVthis environment, I would like to sustain.
p195
aVYou know what I mean?
p196
aVBut I'm just saying, if y'all are interested
p197
aVin the top five songs, you need to holler at me.
p198
aVYou know what I'm saying?
p199
aVAight? In the future or the present. Yeah.
p200
aVEnjoy the rest of it.
p201
aa(lp202
VOkay, next question.
p203
aa(lp204
VWhat do you got?
p205
aa(lp206
V"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VWell I have to say that I don't know about
p210
aVhow many of my organs
p211
aVhave been 3-D printed as such,
p212
aVbut I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,
p213
aVkind of thinking about this concept of the future
p214
aVand that, you know, all around the world
p215
aVparents are kind of telling their small children,
p216
aVplease, you have to eat that, you know,
p217
aVI have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day
p218
aVso that you can have this meal.
p219
aVYou know, that kind of thing.
p220
aVAnd of course now that we have changed, you know,
p221
aVfrom the global South, there is this total
p222
aVkind of perspective shift that is happening around the \u2014
p223
aVYou can't just say to them,
p224
aVwell, there are starving children.
p225
aVWell, it is the future.
p226
aVNobody is starving anymore, thank God.
p227
aVBut as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,
p228
aVand I do hope that we can continue
p229
aVto kind of 3D print,
p230
aVwell, let us just say I like to think that
p231
aVeven in the future we will have the publication,
p232
aVkind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.
p233
aVBut everybody, please do enjoy that,
p234
aVand again, I think that you do throw
p235
aVa cracking good party here at TED.
p236
aVThank you.
p237
aa(lp238
VNext question. (Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VWhat has changed? Okay, it's like,
p241
aVI have to think about that.
p242
aV"What has changed now that women run the world?"
p243
aVFirst of all,
p244
aVI really, like, I just want to say,
p245
aVand my name is Bella,
p246
aVI just want to, like, identify myself,
p247
aVthat, like, as a feminist,
p248
aVI, like, I really find that, like,
p249
aVbecause I was born in the '90s,
p250
aVand, like, there were a lot of women who were
p251
aVas far as feminism was concerned,
p252
aVlike, maybe they didn't understand that, like,
p253
aVa feminist like me, like,
p254
aVI don't think it's required that you have to have
p255
aVa certain kind of voice,
p256
aVor, like, a certain way of presenting yourself
p257
aVto be feminist, because I think that, like,
p258
aVfeminism can be really hot,
p259
aVand I think actually that it's really vital and important.
p260
aVLike, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,
p261
aVGloria Steinem,
p262
aVand, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,
p263
aVwho's, like, obviously, like, a really important feminist from, like, history,
p264
aVand like, I just think that those women, like,
p265
aVreally represent, like, that you can, like,
p266
aVbe vital and, like, amazing,
p267
aVlike, a-mazing,
p268
aVand you don't have to wear, like,
p269
aVan Eileen Fisher caftan,
p270
aVjust to, like, prove that you are a feminist.
p271
aVLike, not that there's anything wrong with that,
p272
aVbut my mom, she's like, like,
p273
aVwhy do you have to wear pants that, like,
p274
aVobjectify your body? I like my pants.
p275
aVLike, I like my voice.
p276
aVLike, she's like, why do you have to talk like \u2014
p277
aVTalk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,
p278
aVand I think that we have to, like,
p279
aVreach out, like, not only across, like,
p280
aVthe different generations of feminists,
p281
aVbut also across the, like, vocal ranges,
p282
aVso that, like, we,
p283
aVbecause otherwise it's just, like,
p284
aVrestriculous within feminism,
p285
aVwhich is just, like, a word that I created
p286
aVthat means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.
p287
aVSo that's my feeling about that.
p288
aVYou guys are a-mazing, by the way.
p289
aa(lp290
VOkay. Next question.
p291
aV(Applause)
p292
aa(lp293
V["They've discovered a cure for cancer, but not baldness? What's up with that?"]
p294
aa(lp295
VYeah, you know what,
p296
aVso my name is Joseph Mancuso.
p297
aVFirst of all, I just want to say that I appreciate
p298
aVthat TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,
p299
aVa pretty orderly group.
p300
aVAnd, you know, I just have to say,
p301
aVthe whole thing with baldness,
p302
aVand, you know, here's the thing.
p303
aVAs long as the woman, in my case \u2014
p304
aVbecause it's a modern world,
p305
aVdo whatever you want to do, I don't have any problem with anybody,
p306
aVenjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?
p307
aVBut as far as I'm concerned,
p308
aVattractiveness,
p309
aVwomen don't really care
p310
aVas much as you think they do
p311
aVabout the, you know.
p312
aVI mean, I remember hearing this woman.
p313
aVShe loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.
p314
aVIt's a pretty young girl, you know?
p315
aVAnd this guy's older.
p316
aVAnd, you know, she said she would love him
p317
aVeven if he had snow on the roof
p318
aVor even if melted and disappeared altogether.
p319
aVAs far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.
p320
aVAm I right, or am I right?
p321
aVSo that's it. That's it. That's it.
p322
aVI don't got nothing more to say.
p323
aVKeep your noses clean.
p324
aa(lp325
VAll right, next question.
p326
aa(lp327
V"Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"
p328
aa(lp329
VUm, well, I,
p330
aVI want to start by saying
p331
aVthat this is a very difficult experience
p332
aVfor a Chinese-American.
p333
aVI don't know what to call myself now,
p334
aVbecause I have really my Chinese identity,
p335
aVbut my kids, they are American-Chinese,
p336
aVbut it's difficult to try to express myself
p337
aVin front of audience of people like this.
p338
aVBut if had to give my opinion about meat,
p339
aVI think first, the most important thing is to say
p340
aVthat we don't have to have perfect food,
p341
aVbut maybe it can also not be poison.
p342
aVMaybe we can have some middle ground for that.
p343
aVBut I will continue to consider this idea,
p344
aVand I will report back maybe next year.
p345
aa(lp346
VNext.
p347
aVNext. Next. (Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
V"Will there ever be a post-racial world?"
p350
aa(lp351
VThank you for having me.
p352
aVMy name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.
p353
aVI'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.
p354
aVI'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,
p355
aVand no, even though it would have seemed
p356
aVlike an obvious choice,
p357
aVno, I did not go into politics.
p358
aVTough crowd.
p359
aV(Laughter)
p360
aVBut I always like to just let people know
p361
aVwhen they ask about race or those kinds of things,
p362
aVyou know, as a member of the First Nations community,
p363
aVyou know, I'm probably
p364
aVnot your typical guy.
p365
aVFor example, in addition to being an activist,
p366
aVI'm also a professional stand-up comedian.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVAnd, you know, I'm most popular
p369
aVon college and university campuses.
p370
aVYou know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,
p371
aVor hey-we're-not-all-white week,
p372
aVthen I'm there. (Laughter)
p373
aVDo I think there will ever be a post-racial world?
p374
aVI think, really, I can't talk about race
p375
aVwithout remembering that it is a construct
p376
aVin certain respects,
p377
aVbut also that, you know,
p378
aVuntil we redress the wrongs of the past,
p379
aVwe're going to be turned around.
p380
aVI don't care if the present is the new future.
p381
aVI think there's a lot of great people here at TED
p382
aVwho are working to address that,
p383
aVso with that, if anything I've said today
p384
aVmakes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.
p385
aV(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VI think we have time for one more.
p388
aa(lp389
V"What's the most popular diet these days?"
p390
aa(lp391
VWho's here?
p392
aa(lp393
VOkay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,
p394
aVas, like, three or four different people.
p395
aVI mean really fast.
p396
aVI'm just gonna let y'all know that, as far as diet is concerned,
p397
aVif you don't love yourself inside,
p398
aVthere is no diet on this Earth
p399
aVthat is going to make your behind small enough
p400
aVfor you to feel good,
p401
aVso just stop wasting your time.
p402
aa(lp403
VI would just like to say as an African woman
p404
aVthat I believe the diet that we need
p405
aVis really to remove the crazy belief
p406
aVthat there is anything wrong
p407
aVwith a nice backside.
p408
aVNo, I am teasing about that.
p409
aVThere is nothing wrong with a woman of size.
p410
aVThat is what I am trying to say.
p411
aVWomen, celebrate your body, for God's sake.
p412
aVStop running around starving.
p413
aVYou are making yourselves and other people miserable.
p414
aa(lp415
VLast answer.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo we're talking about what's the most popular diet?
p418
aVI'm gonna start off by telling y'all that
p419
aVthis is my first time here at TED.
p420
aVI might not be your typical person
p421
aVyou find on this stage.
p422
aVMy dental work not as nice as some people.
p423
aVBut I made Sarah Jones promise
p424
aVshe gonna bring me this time,
p425
aV'cause she didn't bring me before,
p426
aVbut you know, I just want to say,
p427
aVthere's a lot of things more important
p428
aVthan counting calories,
p429
aVand as somebody living on the streets in New York,
p430
aVand getting to come here, hear y'all ideas worth spreading,
p431
aVI want to tell y'all I believe in this idea
p432
aVthat the present is the new future,
p433
aVthat where you sit, you create everything
p434
aVthat's gonna come, for better or worse.
p435
aVAnd for me, I think homeless
p436
aVis the wrong word for it anyway.
p437
aVYou know, I might not have me no place
p438
aVto lay my head at night,
p439
aVbut that just makes me houseless.
p440
aVI have me a home. You do too.
p441
aVFind it and try to find yourself in there.
p442
aVMake sure you know,
p443
aVit's not just about virtual reality in space.
p444
aVThat's wonderful, but it's also about
p445
aVthe actual reality here on Earth.
p446
aVHow are people living today?
p447
aVHow can you be part of the solution?
p448
aVThank y'all for thinking about that
p449
aVright now in the present moment
p450
aVto influence the future.
p451
