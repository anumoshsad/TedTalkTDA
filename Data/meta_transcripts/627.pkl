VI'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity
p4
aVto come and speak to you today
p5
aVabout what I consider to be
p6
aVthe biggest stunt on Earth.
p7
aVOr perhaps not quite on Earth.
p8
aVA parachute jump from the very edge of space.
p9
aVMore about that a bit later on.
p10
aa(lp11
VWhat I'd like to do first is take you through
p12
aVa very brief helicopter ride of stunts
p13
aVand the stunts industry in the movies and in television,
p14
aVand show you how technology
p15
aVhas started to interface with the physical skills
p16
aVof the stunt performer
p17
aVin a way that makes the stunts bigger
p18
aVand actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.
p19
aa(lp20
VI've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.
p21
aVI'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts
p22
aVI often design them.
p23
aVDuring that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.
p24
aVIt's critical now that when a car crash happens
p25
aVit isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.
p26
aVWe can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.
p27
aVWe can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,
p28
aVor any passerby. So, safety is everything.
p29
aVBut it wasn't always that way.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn the old days of the silent movies \u2014
p32
aVHarold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands \u2014
p33
aVa lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.
p34
aVThey had no safety, no real technology.
p35
aVWhat safety they had was very scant.
p36
aVThis is the first stunt woman,
p37
aVRosie Venger, an amazing woman.
p38
aVYou can see from the slide, very very strong.
p39
aVShe really paved the way
p40
aVat a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.
p41
aa(lp42
VMy favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.
p43
aVYakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.
p44
aVHe worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see
p45
aVin the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.
p46
aVThis is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"
p47
aVwhere Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.
p48
aVThere is no safety, no back support,
p49
aVno pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.
p50
aVThat's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.
p51
aa(lp52
VTalking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,
p53
aVsome of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.
p54
aVWe couldn't do them without technology.
p55
aVThese are particularly dangerous
p56
aVbecause there is no mask on my face.
p57
aVThey were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,
p58
aVone for FHM magazine.
p59
aVHighly dangerous, but also you'll notice
p60
aVit doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.
p61
aVThe fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,
p62
aVhave been replaced with modern materials
p63
aVlike Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex \u2014
p64
aVfantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals
p65
aVto burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.
p66
aVHere's a bit more.
p67
aVThere's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.
p68
aa(lp69
VOne of the things that a stuntman often does,
p70
aVand you'll see it every time in the big movies,
p71
aVis be blown through the air.
p72
aVWell, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.
p73
aVAnd that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,
p74
aVand hopefully you make it look good.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.
p77
aVIt's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,
p78
aVbecause it will break your legs very, very quickly
p79
aVif you land on it wrong.
p80
aVHaving said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.
p81
aVAnd that's in the up position. When you step on it,
p82
aVeither by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,
p83
aVit will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,
p84
aVanything from five feet to 30 feet.
p85
aVI could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.
p86
aVWhich I'm sure you wouldn't want.
p87
aVNot today.
p88
aa(lp89
VCar stunts are another area
p90
aVwhere technology and engineering
p91
aVadvances have made life easier for us, and safer.
p92
aVWe can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.
p93
aVBeing run over is never easy.
p94
aVThat's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.
p95
aVBut we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane \u2014
p96
aVthe materials that help us, when we're hit like this,
p97
aVnot to hurt ourselves too much.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe picture in the bottom right-hand corner there
p100
aVis of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.
p101
aVShowing how stunts work in different areas, really.
p102
aVAnd testing breakaway signpost pillars.
p103
aVA company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,
p104
aVa lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.
p105
aVThe car on the left drove into the steel pillar.
p106
aVAnd you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.
p107
aVThey did it by remote control.
p108
aVI drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,
p109
aVand clearly walked away from it.
p110
aa(lp111
VRolling a car over is another area where we use technology.
p112
aVWe used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.
p113
aVBut now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.
p114
aVYou can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor
p115
aVby the wheel of the other car.
p116
aVThat's the piston that was fired out of the floor.
p117
aVWe can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over
p118
aVwith a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)
p119
aa(lp120
VIt's a great job, really. (Laughter)
p121
aVIt's such fun!
p122
aVYou should hear
p123
aVsome of the phone conversations that I have with people
p124
aVon my Bluetooth in the shop.
p125
aV"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,
p126
aVand how about someone, you know, big explosion."
p127
aVAnd people are looking like this ...
p128
aV(Laughs)
p129
aVI sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe next thing that I'd like to show you is something that
p132
aVDunlop asked me to do earlier this year
p133
aVwith our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."
p134
aVA loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.
p135
aVOnly one person had ever done it before.
p136
aVNow, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,
p137
aV"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.
p138
aVLet's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."
p139
aVWell, you'd die if you did that.
p140
aa(lp141
VWe went to Cambridge University, the other university,
p142
aVand spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,
p143
aVa physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.
p144
aVEven then, I caught seven G
p145
aVand lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.
p146
aVThat's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.
p147
aVSo again, science helps us, and with the engineering too \u2014
p148
aVthe modifications to the car and the wheel.
p149
aa(lp150
VHigh falls, they're old fashioned stunts.
p151
aVWhat's interesting about high falls
p152
aVis that although we use airbags,
p153
aVand some airbags are quite advanced,
p154
aVthey're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,
p155
aVif you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.
p156
aVJust basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.
p157
aVIt's a bouncy castle
p158
aVwith slats in the side to allow the air to escape.
p159
aVThat's all it is, a bouncy castle.
p160
aVThat's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.
p161
aVWhat's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.
p162
aVThey used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.
p163
aVAnd that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.
p164
aVThey're great for catching you, up to certain heights.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd on the other side of the fence,
p167
aVthat physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,
p168
aVhas interfaced with the very highest
p169
aVtechnology in I.T. and in software.
p170
aVNot the cardboard box, but the green screen.
p171
aVThis is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.
p172
aVTwo stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.
p173
aVIt's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.
p174
aVWith the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,
p175
aVmoving or still,
p176
aVand I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.
p177
aVThis is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.
p178
aVCompletely in the safety of a studio,
p179
aVand yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,
p180
aVand put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.
p181
aa(lp182
VDecelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.
p183
aVWe fly people on wires, like this.
p184
aVThis guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,
p185
aVor moved around like a kite.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd this is a Guinness World Record attempt.
p188
aVThey asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.
p189
aVAnd again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,
p190
aVand stop within a couple of feet of the ground
p191
aVwithout melting the rope with the friction,
p192
aVbecause of the alloys I used in the descender device.
p193
aVAnd that's Centre Point in London.
p194
aVWe brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.
p195
aa(lp196
VHelicopter stunts are always fun,
p197
aVhanging out of them, whatever.
p198
aVAnd aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.
p199
aVWhich brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:
p200
aVProject Space Jump.
p201
aa(lp202
VIn 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force
p203
aVdid the most spectacular thing.
p204
aVHe did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,
p205
aVand he did it to test high altitude systems
p206
aVfor military pilots
p207
aVin the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.
p208
aVAnd I'd just like to show you a little footage
p209
aVof what he did back then.
p210
aVAnd just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.
p211
aa(lp212
VProject Excelsior, it was called.
p213
aVThere were three jumps.
p214
aVThey first dropped some dummies.
p215
aVSo that's the balloon, big gas balloon.
p216
aVIt's that shape because the helium has to expand.
p217
aVMy balloon will expand to 500 times
p218
aVand look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.
p219
aVThese are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,
p220
aVand there is the camera that's strapped to them.
p221
aVYou can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.
p222
aVAnd I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,
p223
aVwhich is about 22 miles.
p224
aVYou're in a near vacuum in that environment,
p225
aVwhich is in minus 50 degrees.
p226
aVSo it's an extremely hostile place to be.
p227
aa(lp228
VThis is Joe Kittenger himself.
p229
aVBear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.
p230
aVHe didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.
p231
aVI spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
p232
aVHe's a very humble and wonderful human being.
p233
aVHe sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground
p234
aVI wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"
p235
aVwhich I thought was quite lovely.
p236
aVHe's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.
p237
aVThis is him in a pressure suit.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow one of the challenges of going up to altitude is
p240
aVwhen you get to 30,000 feet \u2014 it's great, isn't it? \u2014
p241
aVWhen you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.
p242
aVAbove 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,
p243
aVyou need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.
p244
aVThis is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,
p245
aVpushing him in, those turned up jeans.
p246
aVYou need a pressure suit.
p247
aVYou need a pressure breathing system
p248
aVwith a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in
p249
aVand helps you to exhale.
p250
aa(lp251
VAbove 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.
p252
aVCertainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.
p253
aVNot even a jet engine.
p254
aVIt needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,
p255
aVa great big gas balloon.
p256
aVIt took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team
p257
aVto build the balloon that would do this job.
p258
aVI've found that team in America now.
p259
aVAnd it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.
p260
aVWe will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,
p261
aVand two balloons for the main jump, because they
p262
aVnotoriously tear on takeoff.
p263
aVThey're just so, so delicate.
p264
aa(lp265
VThis is the step off. He's written on that thing,
p266
aV"The highest step in the world."
p267
aVAnd what must that feel like?
p268
aVI'm excited and I'm scared,
p269
aVboth at the same time in equal measures.
p270
aVAnd this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled
p271
aVbefore his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.
p272
aVA drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.
p273
aVYou can just see them there, popping open.
p274
aVThose are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.
p275
aVI did quite a lot of research.
p276
aVAnd you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow just to give you some perspective of this balloon,
p279
aVthe little black dots are people.
p280
aVIt's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
p281
aVThat's in New Mexico.
p282
aVThat's the U.S. Air Force Museum.
p283
aVAnd they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.
p284
aVMy gondola will be more simple than that.
p285
aVIt's a three sided box, basically.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo I've had to do quite a lot of training.
p288
aVThis is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,
p289
aVtraining in preparation for some high altitude jumps.
p290
aVThis is what the view is going to be like
p291
aVat 90,000 feet for me.
p292
aVNow you may think this is just
p293
aVa thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,
p294
aVjust the world's biggest stunt.
p295
aVWell there's a little bit more to it than that.
p296
aa(lp297
VTrying to find a space suit to do this
p298
aVhas led me to an area of technology
p299
aVthat I never really expected when I set about doing this.
p300
aVI contacted a company in the States
p301
aVwho make suits for NASA.
p302
aVThat's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.
p303
aVThat suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.
p304
aVAnd it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.
p305
aVSo I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit
p306
aVthat would do this job, or someone that will make one.
p307
aa(lp308
VSomething revolutionary happened
p309
aVa little while ago, at the same facility.
p310
aVThat's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,
p311
aVthe only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.
p312
aVIt was made by a Russian that's designed
p313
aVmost of the suits of the past
p314
aV18 years for the Soviets.
p315
aVHe left the company because he saw,
p316
aVas some other people in the space suit industry,
p317
aVan emerging market for space suits for space tourists.
p318
aa(lp319
VYou know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet
p320
aVand the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.
p321
aVIf you're at 100,000 feet you die.
p322
aVIn six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.
p323
aVYour blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.
p324
aVThe body swells up. It's awful.
p325
aVAnd so we expect \u2014 it's not much fun.
p326
aVWe expect, and others expect,
p327
aVthat perhaps the FAA, the CAA
p328
aVmight say, "You need to put someone in a suit
p329
aVthat's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."
p330
aVThen they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.
p331
aVAnd then if the cabin depressurizes
p332
aVwhile the aircraft is coming back down,
p333
aVin whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.
p334
aa(lp335
VI would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,
p336
aVto show you the only one of its kind in the world.
p337
aVI was going to wear it,
p338
aVbut I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.
p339
aVThank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.
p340
aVThis is the communication headset you'll see
p341
aVon lots of space suits.
p342
aVIt's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.
p343
aVThis is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.
p344
aVIt's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.
p345
aa(lp346
VIt's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.
p347
aVWould you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?
p348
aVThank you very much.
p349
aVAnd it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,
p350
aVas you can see from the picture down there.
p351
aa(lp352
VI've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,
p353
aVwhich means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,
p354
aVbefore I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.
p355
aV(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VLadies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.
p358
aVThe status of my mission at the moment
p359
aVis it still needs a major sponsor.
p360
aVI'm confident that we'll find one.
p361
aVI think it's a great challenge.
p362
aVAnd I hope that you will agree with me,
p363
aVit is the greatest stunt on Earth.
p364
aVThank you very much for your time.
