VMy job at Twitter
p4
aVis to ensure user trust,
p5
aVprotect user rights and keep users safe,
p6
aVboth from each other
p7
aVand, at times, from themselves.
p8
aVLet's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.
p9
aVBack in January 2009,
p10
aVwe saw more than two million new tweets each day
p11
aVon the platform.
p12
aVJanuary 2014, more than 500 million.
p13
aVWe were seeing two million tweets
p14
aVin less than six minutes.
p15
aVThat's a 24,900-percent increase.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, the vast majority of activity on Twitter
p18
aVputs no one in harm's way.
p19
aVThere's no risk involved.
p20
aVMy job is to root out and prevent activity that might.
p21
aVSounds straightforward, right?
p22
aVYou might even think it'd be easy,
p23
aVgiven that I just said the vast majority
p24
aVof activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.
p25
aVWhy spend so much time
p26
aVsearching for potential calamities
p27
aVin innocuous activities?
p28
aVGiven the scale that Twitter is at,
p29
aVa one-in-a-million chance happens
p30
aV500 times a day.
p31
aVIt's the same for other companies
p32
aVdealing at this sort of scale.
p33
aVFor us, edge cases,
p34
aVthose rare situations that are unlikely to occur,
p35
aVare more like norms.
p36
aVSay 99.999 percent of tweets
p37
aVpose no risk to anyone.
p38
aVThere's no threat involved.
p39
aVMaybe people are documenting travel landmarks
p40
aVlike Australia's Heart Reef,
p41
aVor tweeting about a concert they're attending,
p42
aVor sharing pictures of cute baby animals.
p43
aVAfter you take out that 99.999 percent,
p44
aVthat tiny percentage of tweets remaining
p45
aVworks out to roughly
p46
aV150,000 per month.
p47
aVThe sheer scale of what we're dealing with
p48
aVmakes for a challenge.
p49
aa(lp50
VYou know what else makes my role
p51
aVparticularly challenging?
p52
aVPeople do weird things.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVAnd I have to figure out what they're doing,
p55
aVwhy, and whether or not there's risk involved,
p56
aVoften without much in terms of context
p57
aVor background.
p58
aVI'm going to show you some examples
p59
aVthat I've run into during my time at Twitter \u2014
p60
aVthese are all real examples \u2014
p61
aVof situations that at first seemed cut and dried,
p62
aVbut the truth of the matter was something
p63
aValtogether different.
p64
aVThe details have been changed
p65
aVto protect the innocent
p66
aVand sometimes the guilty.
p67
aVWe'll start off easy.
p68
aa(lp69
V["Yo bitch"]
p70
aa(lp71
VIf you saw a Tweet that only said this,
p72
aVyou might think to yourself,
p73
aV"That looks like abuse."
p74
aVAfter all, why would you want to receive the message,
p75
aV"Yo, bitch."
p76
aVNow, I try to stay relatively hip
p77
aVto the latest trends and memes,
p78
aVso I knew that "yo, bitch"
p79
aVwas also often a common greeting between friends,
p80
aVas well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.
p81
aVI will admit that I did not expect
p82
aVto encounter a fourth use case.
p83
aVIt turns out it is also used on Twitter
p84
aVwhen people are role-playing as dogs.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVAnd in fact, in that case,
p87
aVit's not only not abusive,
p88
aVit's technically just an accurate greeting.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VSo okay, determining whether or not
p92
aVsomething is abusive without context,
p93
aVdefinitely hard.
p94
aa(lp95
VLet's look at spam.
p96
aVHere's an example of an account engaged
p97
aVin classic spammer behavior,
p98
aVsending the exact same message
p99
aVto thousands of people.
p100
aVWhile this is a mockup I put together using my account,
p101
aVwe see accounts doing this all the time.
p102
aVSeems pretty straightforward.
p103
aVWe should just automatically suspend accounts
p104
aVengaging in this kind of behavior.
p105
aVTurns out there's some exceptions to that rule.
p106
aVTurns out that that message could also be a notification
p107
aVyou signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead
p108
aVbecause you wanted to go outside
p109
aVand see if you could see it.
p110
aVYou're not going to get that chance
p111
aVif we mistakenly suspend the account
p112
aVthinking it's spam.
p113
aa(lp114
VOkay. Let's make the stakes higher.
p115
aVBack to my account,
p116
aVagain exhibiting classic behavior.
p117
aVThis time it's sending the same message and link.
p118
aVThis is often indicative of  something called phishing,
p119
aVsomebody trying to steal another person's account information
p120
aVby directing them to another website.
p121
aVThat's pretty clearly not a good thing.
p122
aVWe want to, and do, suspend accounts
p123
aVengaging in that kind of behavior.
p124
aVSo why are the stakes higher for this?
p125
aVWell, this could also be a bystander at a rally
p126
aVwho managed to record a video
p127
aVof a police officer beating a non-violent protester
p128
aVwho's trying to let the world know what's happening.
p129
aVWe don't want to gamble
p130
aVon potentially silencing that crucial speech
p131
aVby classifying it as spam and suspending it.
p132
aVThat means we evaluate hundreds of parameters
p133
aVwhen looking at account behaviors,
p134
aVand even then, we can still get it wrong
p135
aVand have to reevaluate.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against,
p138
aVit's crucial that I not only predict
p139
aVbut also design protections for the unexpected.
p140
aVAnd that's not just an issue for me,
p141
aVor for Twitter, it's an issue for you.
p142
aVIt's an issue for anybody who's building or creating
p143
aVsomething that you think is going to be amazing
p144
aVand will let people do awesome things.
p145
aVSo what do I do?
p146
aVI pause and I think,
p147
aVhow could all of this
p148
aVgo horribly wrong?
p149
aVI visualize catastrophe.
p150
aVAnd that's hard. There's a sort of
p151
aVinherent cognitive dissonance in doing that,
p152
aVlike when you're writing your wedding vows
p153
aVat the same time as your prenuptial agreement.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVBut you still have to do it,
p156
aVparticularly if you're marrying  500 million tweets per day.
p157
aVWhat do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?"
p158
aVI try to think of how something as
p159
aVbenign and innocuous as a picture of a cat
p160
aVcould lead to death,
p161
aVand what to do to prevent that.
p162
aVWhich happens to be my next example.
p163
aVThis is my cat, Eli.
p164
aVWe wanted to give users the ability
p165
aVto add photos to their tweets.
p166
aVA picture is worth a thousand words.
p167
aVYou only get 140 characters.
p168
aVYou add a photo to your tweet,
p169
aVlook at how much more content you've got now.
p170
aVThere's all sorts of great things you can do
p171
aVby adding a photo to a tweet.
p172
aVMy job isn't to think of those.
p173
aVIt's to think of what could go wrong.
p174
aa(lp175
VHow could this picture
p176
aVlead to my death?
p177
aVWell, here's one possibility.
p178
aVThere's more in that picture than just a cat.
p179
aVThere's geodata.
p180
aVWhen you take a picture with your smartphone
p181
aVor digital camera,
p182
aVthere's a lot of additional information
p183
aVsaved along in that image.
p184
aVIn fact, this image also contains
p185
aVthe equivalent of this,
p186
aVmore specifically, this.
p187
aVSure, it's not likely that someone's going to try
p188
aVto track me down and do me harm
p189
aVbased upon image data associated
p190
aVwith a picture I took of my cat,
p191
aVbut I start by assuming the worst will happen.
p192
aVThat's why, when we launched photos on Twitter,
p193
aVwe made the decision to strip that geodata out.
p194
aV(Applause)
p195
aVIf I start by assuming the worst
p196
aVand work backwards,
p197
aVI can make sure that the protections we build
p198
aVwork for both expected
p199
aVand unexpected use cases.
p200
aa(lp201
VGiven that I spend my days and nights
p202
aVimagining the worst that could happen,
p203
aVit wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVIt's not.
p206
aVThe vast majority of interactions I see \u2014
p207
aVand I see a lot, believe me \u2014 are positive,
p208
aVpeople reaching out to help
p209
aVor to connect or share information with each other.
p210
aVIt's just that for those of us dealing with scale,
p211
aVfor those of us tasked with keeping people safe,
p212
aVwe have to assume the worst will happen,
p213
aVbecause for us, a one-in-a-million chance
p214
aVis pretty good odds.
