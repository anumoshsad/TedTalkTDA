VI want to tell you a story about a girl.
p4
aVBut I can't tell you her real name.
p5
aVSo let's just call her Hadiza.
p6
aa(lp7
VHadiza is 20.
p8
aVShe's shy,
p9
aVbut she has a beautiful smile that lights up her face.
p10
aVBut she's in constant pain.
p11
aVAnd she will likely be on medication for the rest of her life.
p12
aa(lp13
VDo you want to know why?
p14
aVHadiza is a Chibok girl,
p15
aVand on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped
p16
aVby Boko Haram terrorists.
p17
aVShe managed to escape, though,
p18
aVby jumping off the truck that was carrying the girls.
p19
aVBut when she landed, she broke both her legs,
p20
aVand she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes.
p21
aVShe told me she was terrified that Boko Haram would come back for her.
p22
aVShe was one of 57 girls who would escape by jumping off trucks that day.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis story, quite rightly, caused ripples
p25
aVaround the world.
p26
aVPeople like Michelle Obama, Malala and others
p27
aVlent their voices in protest,
p28
aVand at about the same time \u2014 I was living in London at the time \u2014
p29
aVI was sent from London to Abuja to cover the World Economic Forum
p30
aVthat Nigeria was hosting for the first time.
p31
aVBut when we arrived, it was clear that there was only one story in town.
p32
aVWe put the government under pressure.
p33
aVWe asked tough questions about what they were doing
p34
aVto bring these girls back.
p35
aVUnderstandably,
p36
aVthey weren't too happy with our line of questioning,
p37
aVand let's just say we received our fair share of "alternative facts."
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VInfluential Nigerians were telling us at the time
p42
aVthat we were naïve,
p43
aVwe didn't understand the political situation in Nigeria.
p44
aVBut they also told us
p45
aVthat the story of the Chibok girls
p46
aVwas a hoax.
p47
aVSadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,
p48
aVand there are still people in Nigeria today
p49
aVwho believe that the Chibok girls were never kidnapped.
p50
aVYet I was talking to people like these \u2014
p51
aVdevastated parents,
p52
aVwho told us that on the day Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,
p53
aVthey ran into the Sambisa Forest after the trucks carrying their daughters.
p54
aVThey were armed with machetes, but they were forced to turn back
p55
aVbecause Boko Haram had guns.
p56
aa(lp57
VFor two years, inevitably, the news agenda moved on,
p58
aVand for two years,
p59
aVwe didn't hear much about the Chibok girls.
p60
aVEveryone presumed they were dead.
p61
aVBut in April last year,
p62
aVI was able to obtain this video.
p63
aVThis is a still from the video
p64
aVthat Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,
p65
aVand through a source, I obtained this video.
p66
aVBut before I could publish it,
p67
aVI had to travel to the northeast of Nigeria
p68
aVto talk to the parents, to verify it.
p69
aVI didn't have to wait too long for confirmation.
p70
aVOne of the mothers, when she watched the video, told me
p71
aVthat if she could have reached into the laptop
p72
aVand pulled our her child from the laptop,
p73
aVshe would have done so.
p74
aVFor those of you who are parents, like myself, in the audience,
p75
aVyou can only imagine the anguish
p76
aVthat that mother felt.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis video would go on to kick-start negotiation talks with Boko Haram.
p79
aVAnd a Nigerian senator told me that because of this video
p80
aVthey entered into those talks,
p81
aVbecause they had long presumed that the Chibok girls were dead.
p82
aVTwenty-one girls were freed in October last year.
p83
aVSadly, nearly 200 of them still remain missing.
p84
aa(lp85
VI must confess that I have not been a dispassionate observer
p86
aVcovering this story.
p87
aVI am furious when I think about the wasted opportunities
p88
aVto rescue these girls.
p89
aVI am furious when I think about what the parents have told me,
p90
aVthat if these were daughters of the rich and the powerful,
p91
aVthey would have been found much earlier.
p92
aVAnd I am furious
p93
aVthat the hoax narrative,
p94
aVI firmly believe,
p95
aVcaused a delay;
p96
aVit was part of the reason for the delay in their return.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis illustrates to me the deadly danger of fake news.
p99
aVSo what can we do about it?
p100
aVThere are some very smart people,
p101
aVsmart engineers at Google and Facebook,
p102
aVwho are trying to use technology to stop the spread of fake news.
p103
aVBut beyond that, I think everybody here \u2014 you and I \u2014
p104
aVwe have a role to play in that.
p105
aVWe are the ones who share the content.
p106
aVWe are the ones who share the stories online.
p107
aVIn this day and age, we're all publishers,
p108
aVand we have responsibility.
p109
aa(lp110
VIn my job as a journalist,
p111
aVI check, I verify.
p112
aVI trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.
p113
aVWhy is this person telling me this story?
p114
aVWhat do they have to gain by sharing this information?
p115
aVDo they have a hidden agenda?
p116
aVI really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions
p117
aVof information that we discover online.
p118
aa(lp119
VResearch shows that some of us don't even read beyond headlines
p120
aVbefore we share stories.
p121
aVWho here has done that?
p122
aVI know I have.
p123
aVBut what if
p124
aVwe stopped taking information that we discover at face value?
p125
aVWhat if we stop to think about the consequence
p126
aVof the information that we pass on
p127
aVand its potential to incite violence or hatred?
p128
aVWhat if we stop to think about the real-life consequences
p129
aVof the information that we share?
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you very much for listening.
