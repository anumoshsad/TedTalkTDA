VHow many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?
p4
aVAny of you get really freaked out by that?
p5
aVYou might want to leave now.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo this is a vending machine for crows.
p10
aVOver the past few days, many of you have been asking,
p11
aV"How did you come to this? How did you get started doing this?"
p12
aVIt started, as with many great ideas,
p13
aVor many ideas you can't get rid of, anyway,
p14
aVat a cocktail party.
p15
aVAbout 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine.
p16
aVWe were sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows
p17
aVthat were all over his yard and making a big mess.
p18
aVAnd he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things,
p19
aVkill them, because they're making a mess.
p20
aVI said that was stupid,
p21
aVmaybe we should just train them to do something useful.
p22
aVAnd he said that was impossible.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying,
p25
aVwhen someone tells you it's impossible.
p26
aVSo I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd after 10 years of this, my wife said,
p31
aV"You've got to do this thing you've been talking about,
p32
aVand build the vending machine."
p33
aVSo I did.
p34
aVBut part of the reason I found this interesting is,
p35
aVI started noticing that we're very aware of all the species
p36
aVthat are going extinct on the planet
p37
aVas a result of human habitation expansion,
p38
aVand no one seems to be paying attention to all the species
p39
aVthat are actually living; they're surviving.
p40
aVAnd I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species,
p41
aVwhich have adapted specifically for human ecologies,
p42
aVspecies like rats and cockroaches and crows.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.
p45
aVThey'd become extremely adept at living with us.
p46
aVAnd in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.
p51
aVWe were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.
p52
aVSo, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.
p53
aVAnd cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows,
p54
aVhave become really immune to the poisons that we're using.
p55
aVSo I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial;
p56
aVsomething that we can both benefit from,
p57
aVand find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
p58
aVSo I built the vending machine.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting
p61
aVif you know more about crows.
p62
aVIt turns out, crows aren't just surviving with human beings;
p63
aVthey're actually thriving.
p64
aVThey're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic
p65
aVand the southern tip of South America.
p66
aVAnd in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding
p67
aVmore than five kilometers away from human beings.
p68
aVSo we may not think about them, but they're always around.
p69
aVAnd not surprisingly, given the human population growth,
p70
aVmore than half of the human population is living in cities now.
p71
aVAnd out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population
p72
aVis occurring in cities.
p73
aVWe're seeing a population boom with crows.
p74
aVSo bird counts are indicating
p75
aVthat we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.
p76
aVSo that's no great surprise.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut what was really interesting to me was to find out
p79
aVthat the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
p80
aVAnd I'll give you an example of that.
p81
aVThis is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.
p82
aVAnd these crows use sticks in the wild
p83
aVto get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.
p84
aVHere, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.
p85
aVBut the researchers had a problem.
p86
aVThey messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.
p87
aVAnd she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.
p88
aVYou see, it wasn't working very well.
p89
aVSo she adapted.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, this is completely unprompted; she had never seen this done before.
p92
aVNo one taught her to bend this into a hook
p93
aVor had shown her how it could happen.
p94
aVBut she did it all on her own.
p95
aVSo keep in mind \u2014 she's never seen this done.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VRight.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VYeah. All right.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo that's the part where the researchers freak out.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VIt turns out,
p112
aVwe've been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent.
p113
aVTheir brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.
p114
aVThere's all kinds of anecdotes
p115
aVfor the different kinds of intelligence they have.
p116
aVFor example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen
p117
aVto drop lines through holes in the ice.
p118
aVAnd when the fishermen move off,
p119
aVthe crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.
p120
aVIt's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
p121
aa(lp122
VOn an entirely different tack,
p123
aVat University of Washington a few years ago,
p124
aVthey were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.
p125
aVSome students went out, netted some crows, brought them in,
p126
aVweighed and measured them, and let them back out again.
p127
aVAnd they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week,
p128
aVwhenever these particular students walked around campus,
p129
aVthese crows would caw at them and run around,
p130
aVand make their life kind of miserable.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VThey were significantly less entertained
p135
aVwhen this went on for the next week.
p136
aVAnd the next month.
p137
aVAnd after summer break.
p138
aVUntil they finally graduated and left campus,
p139
aVand \u2014 glad to get away, I'm sure \u2014
p140
aVcame back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, the moral being: don't piss off crows.
p145
aVSo now, students at the University of Washington
p146
aVthat are studying these crows, do so with a giant wig and a big mask.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VIt's fairly interesting.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo we know these crows are really smart,
p155
aVbut the more I dug into this, the more I found
p156
aVthat they actually have an even more significant adaptation.
p157
aa(lp158
VVideo: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living
p159
aVin these new urban environments.
p160
aVIn this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food
p161
aVthat normally they can't manage:
p162
aVdrop it among the traffic.
p163
aVThe problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.
p164
aVWait for the light to stop the traffic.
p165
aVThen, collect your cracked nut in safety.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VJoshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.
p172
aVWhat's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars
p173
aVto crack nuts.
p174
aVIn fact, that's old hat for crows.
p175
aVThis happened about 10 years ago
p176
aVin a place called Sendai City, at a driving school
p177
aVin the suburbs of Tokyo.
p178
aVAnd since that time,
p179
aVall the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.
p180
aVNow every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk,
p181
aVwaiting to collect its lunch.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.
p184
aVParents seem to be teaching their young.
p185
aVThey learn from their peers, they learn from their enemies.
p186
aVIf I have a little extra time,
p187
aVI'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity
p188
aVthat illustrates that nicely.
p189
aVThe point being, they've developed cultural adaptation.
p190
aVAnd as we heard yesterday,
p191
aVthat's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble,
p192
aVand we're starting to see it with them.
p193
aVThey're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt
p194
aVto new challenges and new resources in their environment,
p195
aVwhich is really useful if you live in a city.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo we know that there's lots of crows.
p198
aVWe found out they're really smart and they can teach each other.
p199
aVWhen all this became clear,
p200
aVI realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
p201
aVSo that's what we did.
p202
aVThis is a vending machine for crows.
p203
aVAnd it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
p204
aVIt's pretty simple.
p205
aVBasically, what happens is that we put this out in a field
p206
aVor someplace where there's lots of crows.
p207
aVWe put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.
p208
aVCrows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,
p209
aVand get used to the machine being there.
p210
aVEventually, they eat all the peanuts.
p211
aVThen they see peanuts here on the feeder tray,
p212
aVand hop up and help themselves.
p213
aVThen they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts,
p214
aVand life is dandy if you're a crow \u2014
p215
aVyou can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.
p218
aVNow they're used to the sound of the machine;
p219
aVthey keep coming back and digging out peanuts
p220
aVfrom the pile of coins that's there.
p221
aVWhen they get really happy about this, we stymie them.
p222
aa(lp223
VWe move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.
p224
aVNow, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing,
p225
aVthis really pisses them off.
p226
aVSo they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something:
p227
aVsweep things out of the way with their beak.
p228
aVThey do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot.
p229
aVWhen that happens, they get a peanut.
p230
aVThis goes on for some time.
p231
aVThe crows learn that all they have to do is show up,
p232
aVwait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot,
p233
aVthen get their peanut.
p234
aa(lp235
VWhen they're good and comfortable with that,
p236
aVwe move to the final stage, where they show up and nothing happens.
p237
aVThis is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.
p238
aVSquirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.
p239
aVCome back, look for the peanut, go away.
p240
aVThey do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored,
p241
aVand then they go off and play in traffic.
p242
aa(lp243
VCrows, on the other hand, show up and they try and figure it out.
p244
aVThey know this machine has been messing with them
p245
aVthrough three different stages of behavior.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VThey figure there must be more to it.
p250
aVSo they poke at it and peck at it.
p251
aVAnd eventually some crow gets a bright idea:
p252
aV"Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage,
p253
aVhops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot, and we're off to the races.
p254
aVThat crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts,
p255
aVuntil his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, what's significant about this to me
p258
aVisn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.
p259
aVMind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year,
p260
aVbut I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VInstead, I think we should look a little bit larger.
p265
aVI think crows can be trained to do other things.
p266
aVFor example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?
p267
aVOr find expensive components from discarded electronics?
p268
aVOr maybe do search and rescue?
p269
aVThe main point of all this for me is,
p270
aVwe can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.
p271
aVWe can find ways to interact with these other species
p272
aVthat doesn't involve exterminating them,
p273
aVbut involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.
p274
aa(lp275
VThanks very much.
