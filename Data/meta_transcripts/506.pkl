VOne thing I wanted to say about film making is \u2014 about this film \u2014
p4
aVin thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,
p5
aVMichael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,
p6
aVthis idea that there is a narrative line,
p7
aVand that music exists in time.
p8
aVA film also exists in time; it's an experience
p9
aVthat you should go through emotionally.
p10
aVAnd in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen
p11
aVwere all about learning something,
p12
aVor knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.
p13
aVAnd I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,
p14
aVand really to follow my journey.
p15
aVSo instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,
p16
aVand we meet people along the way.
p17
aVWe only meet them once.
p18
aVThey don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.
p19
aVIt's something like life, that once you get in it
p20
aVyou can't get out.
p21
aa(lp22
VThere are two clips I want to show you,
p23
aVthe first one is a kind of hodgepodge,
p24
aVits just three little moments, four little moments
p25
aVwith three of the people who are here tonight.
p26
aVIt's not the way they occur in the film,
p27
aVbecause they are part of much larger scenes.
p28
aVThey play off each other in a wonderful way.
p29
aVAnd that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,
p30
aVtalking about something that is very dear to him,
p31
aVwhich is the accidents of life.
p32
aVI think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,
p33
aVand perhaps not planned at all.
p34
aVAnd those three clips will be followed by a scene of
p35
aVperhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building
p36
aVwhich is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
p37
aVHe built the capital over there.
p38
aVAnd I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen \u2014
p39
aVit's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.
p40
aVWe were the first film crew in there.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo you'll see images of this remarkable building.
p43
aVA couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,
p44
aVit was built entirely by hand,
p45
aVI think they got a crane the last year.
p46
aVIt was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,
p47
aVpeople carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,
p48
aVdumping them in the forms.
p49
aVIt is the capital of the country,
p50
aVand it took 23 years to build,
p51
aVwhich is something they seem to be very proud of over there.
p52
aVIt took as long as the Taj Mahal.
p53
aVUnfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.
p54
aVHe died in 1974.
p55
aVThe building was finished in 1983.
p56
aVSo it continued on for many years
p57
aVafter he died.
p58
aVThink about that when you see that building,
p59
aVthat sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd that really struck me about my father,
p62
aVin the sense that he had such belief
p63
aVthat somehow, doing these things
p64
aVgiving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,
p65
aVeven in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,
p66
aVand the construction stopped totally and he kept working,
p67
aVbecause he felt, "Well when the war is done
p68
aVthey'll need this building."
p69
aVSo, those are the two clips I'm going to show.
p70
aVRoll that tape.
p71
aV(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VRichard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.
p74
aVAnd I came home and I said to my father and mother,
p75
aV"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,
p76
aVand he's sort of ugly, funny voice,
p77
aVand he's a teacher at school.
p78
aVI know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day
p79
aVthat someday you will hear of him,
p80
aVbecause he's really an amazing man."
p81
aa(lp82
VFrank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?
p83
aa(lp84
VNathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VNK: Did you hear that, really?
p89
aa(lp90
VFG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.
p91
aa(lp92
VMoshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.
p93
aVAnd you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,
p94
aVhe would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office
p95
aVfor two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.
p96
aVYou know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us
p97
aVand there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
p98
aVI mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,
p99
aVit was so consistent with his life, you know?
p100
aVI mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,
p101
aVor I'm going to die in an airport,
p102
aVor die jogging without an identification on me.
p103
aVI don't know why I sort of carry that
p104
aVfrom that memory of the way he died.
p105
aVBut he was a sort of a nomad at heart.
p106
aa(lp107
VLouis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really
p108
aVand how full of influence by circumstance.
p109
aa(lp110
VMan: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here
p111
aVand enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere
p112
aVand this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.
p113
aVWe are proud of it.
p114
aa(lp115
VNK: You're proud of it?
p116
aa(lp117
VMan: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.
p118
aa(lp119
VNK: Do you know anything about the architect?
p120
aa(lp121
VMan: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.
p122
aa(lp123
VNK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,
p124
aVhe was my father.
p125
aa(lp126
VMan: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?
p127
aa(lp128
VNK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.
p129
aa(lp130
VMan: Louis Kahn, yes!
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VMan: Your father, is he alive?
p135
aa(lp136
VNK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.
p137
aa(lp138
VMan: Very pleased to welcome you back.
p139
aa(lp140
VNK: Thank you.
p141
aa(lp142
VNK: He never saw it finished, Pop.
p143
aVNo, he never saw this.
p144
aa(lp145
VShamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.
p146
aVIn 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,
p147
aVand since we invited him here,
p148
aVhe felt that he has got a responsibility.
p149
aVHe wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.
p150
aVHe is not a political man,
p151
aVbut in this guise he has given us
p152
aVthe institution for democracy, from where we can rise.
p153
aVIn that way it is so relevant.
p154
aVHe didn't care for how much money this country has,
p155
aVor whether he would be able to ever finish this building,
p156
aVbut somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.
p157
aVAnd this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.
p158
aa(lp159
VNK: It cost him his life.
p160
aa(lp161
VSW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,
p162
aVand that is why he is great and we'll remember him.
p163
aVBut he was also human.
p164
aVNow his failure to satisfy the family life,
p165
aVis an inevitable association of great people.
p166
aVBut I think his son will understand this,
p167
aVand will have no sense of grudge,
p168
aVor sense of being neglected, I think.
p169
aVHe cared in a very different manner,
p170
aVbut it takes a lot of time to understand that.
p171
aVIn social aspect of his life
p172
aVhe was just like a child, he was not at all matured.
p173
aVHe could not say no to anything,
p174
aVand that is why, that he cannot say no to things,
p175
aVwe got this building today.
p176
aVYou see, only that way you can be able to understand him.
p177
aVThere is no other shortcut,
p178
aVno other way to really understand him.
p179
aVBut I think he has given us this building
p180
aVand we feel all the time for him,
p181
aVthat's why, he has given love for us.
p182
aVHe could not probably give the right kind of love for you,
p183
aVbut for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,
p184
aVthat is important.
p185
aVYou have to understand that.
p186
aVHe had an enormous amount of love,
p187
aVhe loved everybody.
p188
aVTo love everybody, he sometimes did not see
p189
aVthe very closest ones,
p190
aVand that is inevitable for men of his stature.
