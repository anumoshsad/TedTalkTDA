VSo whenever I visit a school and talk to students,
p4
aVI always ask them the same thing:
p5
aVWhy do you Google?
p6
aVWhy is Google the search engine of choice for you?
p7
aVStrangely enough, I always get the same three answers.
p8
aVOne, "Because it works,"
p9
aVwhich is a great answer; that's why I Google, too.
p10
aVTwo, somebody will say,
p11
aV"I really don't know of any alternatives."
p12
aVIt's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually,
p13
aV"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'
p14
aVyou may find a couple of interesting alternatives."
p15
aVAnd last but not least, thirdly,
p16
aVinevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say,
p17
aV"With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result."
p18
aVCertain to always get the best, unbiased search result.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, as a man of the humanities,
p21
aValbeit a digital humanities man,
p22
aVthat just makes my skin curl,
p23
aVeven if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result
p24
aVis a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google.
p25
aVI will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle
p28
aVbehind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget.
p29
aVSo whenever you set out to Google something,
p30
aVstart by asking yourself this: "Am I looking for an isolated fact?"
p31
aVWhat is the capital of France?
p32
aVWhat are the building blocks of a water molecule?
p33
aVGreat \u2014 Google away.
p34
aVThere's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving
p35
aVthat it's actually London and H30.
p36
aVYou don't see a big conspiracy among those things.
p37
aVWe agree, on a global scale,
p38
aVwhat the answers are to these isolated facts.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like,
p41
aV"Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"
p42
aVYou're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore,
p43
aVyou're looking for knowledge,
p44
aVwhich is something way more complicated and delicate.
p45
aVAnd to get to knowledge,
p46
aVyou have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table
p47
aVand acknowledge them and say, "Yes, these are all true."
p48
aVBut because of who I am,
p49
aVyoung or old, black or white, gay or straight,
p50
aVI will value them differently.
p51
aVAnd I will say, "Yes, this is true,
p52
aVbut this is more important to me than that."
p53
aVAnd this is where it becomes interesting,
p54
aVbecause this is where we become human.
p55
aVThis is when we start to argue, to form society.
p56
aVAnd to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here,
p57
aVthrough friends and neighbors and parents and children
p58
aVand coworkers and newspapers and magazines,
p59
aVto finally be grounded in real knowledge,
p60
aVwhich is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard
p63
aVto get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge \u2014
p64
aVas food for thought.
p65
aVI will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries.
p66
aVWe'll start with "Michelle Obama,"
p67
aVthe First Lady of the United States.
p68
aVAnd we'll click for pictures.
p69
aVIt works really well, as you can see.
p70
aVIt's a perfect search result, more or less.
p71
aVIt's just her in the picture, not even the President.
p72
aa(lp73
VHow does this work?
p74
aVQuite simple.
p75
aVGoogle uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply,
p76
aVthey look at two things more than anything.
p77
aVFirst, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website?
p78
aVDoes it say "Michelle Obama" under the picture?
p79
aVPretty good indication it's actually her on there.
p80
aVSecond, Google looks at the picture file,
p81
aVthe name of the file as such uploaded to the website.
p82
aVAgain, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?
p83
aVPretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture.
p84
aVSo, you've got those two and you get a search result like this \u2014 almost.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign,
p87
aVwhere people set out to insult her through her search results.
p88
aVThere was a picture distributed widely over the Internet
p89
aVwhere her face was distorted to look like a monkey.
p90
aVAnd that picture was published all over.
p91
aVAnd people published it very, very purposefully,
p92
aVto get it up there in the search results.
p93
aVThey made sure to write "Michelle Obama" in the caption
p94
aVand they made sure to upload the picture as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.
p95
aVYou get why \u2014 to manipulate the search result.
p96
aVAnd it worked, too.
p97
aVSo when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009,
p98
aVthat distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, the results are self-cleansing,
p101
aVand that's sort of the beauty of it,
p102
aVbecause Google measures relevance every hour, every day.
p103
aVHowever, Google didn't settle for that this time,
p104
aVthey just thought, "That's racist and it's a bad search result
p105
aVand we're going to go back and clean that up manually.
p106
aVWe are going to write some code and fix it,"
p107
aVwhich they did.
p108
aVAnd I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea.
p109
aVMe neither.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut then, a couple of years go by,
p112
aVand the world's most-Googled Anders,
p113
aVAnders Behring Breivik,
p114
aVdid what he did.
p115
aVThis is July 22 in 2011,
p116
aVand a terrible day in Norwegian history.
p117
aVThis man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings
p118
aVwalking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway
p119
aVand then he traveled to the island of Utøya
p120
aVand shot and killed a group of kids.
p121
aVAlmost 80 people died that day.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps,
p124
aVthat he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids.
p125
aVIt's not true.
p126
aVIt was three steps.
p127
aVHe blew up those buildings, he shot those kids,
p128
aVand he sat down and waited for the world to Google him.
p129
aVAnd he prepared all three steps equally well.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd if there was somebody who immediately understood this,
p132
aVit was a Swedish web developer,
p133
aVa search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.
p134
aVHe's also a very political guy
p135
aVand he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook.
p136
aVAnd he told everybody,
p137
aV"If there's something that this guy wants right now,
p138
aVit's to control the image of himself.
p139
aVLet's see if we can distort that.
p140
aVLet's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did
p141
aVthrough insulting him in his search results."
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd how?
p144
aVHe told all of his readers the following,
p145
aV"Go out there on the Internet,
p146
aVfind pictures of dog poop on sidewalks \u2014
p147
aVfind pictures of dog poop on sidewalks \u2014
p148
aVpublish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs.
p149
aVMake sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption,
p150
aVmake sure to name the picture file "Breivik.jpeg."
p151
aVLet's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist."
p152
aVAnd it worked.
p153
aVTwo years after that campaign against Michelle Obama,
p154
aVthis manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked.
p155
aVIf you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden,
p156
aVyou'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results,
p157
aVas a little protest.
p158
aa(lp159
VStrangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time.
p160
aVThey did not step in and manually clean those search results up.
p161
aVSo the million-dollar question,
p162
aVis there anything different between these two happenings here?
p163
aVIs there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama
p164
aVand what happened to Anders Behring Breivik?
p165
aVOf course not.
p166
aVIt's the exact same thing,
p167
aVyet Google intervened in one case and not in the other.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhy?
p170
aVBecause Michelle Obama is an honorable person, that's why,
p171
aVand Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person.
p172
aVSee what happens there?
p173
aVAn evaluation of a person takes place
p174
aVand there's only one power-player in the world
p175
aVwith the authority to say who's who.
p176
aV"We like you, we dislike you.
p177
aVWe believe in you, we don't believe in you.
p178
aVYou're right, you're wrong. You're true, you're false.
p179
aVYou're Obama, and you're Breivik."
p180
aVThat's power if I ever saw it.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm
p183
aVis always a person,
p184
aVa person with a set of personal beliefs
p185
aVthat no code can ever completely eradicate.
p186
aVAnd my message goes out not only to Google,
p187
aVbut to all believers in the faith of code around the world.
p188
aVYou need to identify your own personal bias.
p189
aVYou need to understand that you are human
p190
aVand take responsibility accordingly.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time
p193
aVwhen it's absolutely imperative
p194
aVthat we tie those bonds together again, tighter:
p195
aVthe humanities and the technology.
p196
aVTighter than ever.
p197
aVAnd, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea
p198
aVof the unbiased, clean search result
p199
aVis, and is likely to remain, a myth.
p200
aa(lp201
VThank you for your time.
