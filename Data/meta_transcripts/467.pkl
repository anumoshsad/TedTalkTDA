VFifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,
p4
aVno one \u2014 not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson \u2014
p5
aVimagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean
p6
aVby what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
p7
aVIt seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,
p8
aVbut now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.
p9
aa(lp10
VI want to share with you
p11
aVmy personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,
p12
aVand to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost \u2014
p13
aVactually, we've taken, we've eaten \u2014
p14
aVmore than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;
p15
aVwhy you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;
p16
aVwhy a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific
p17
aVshould concern not only the creatures that are dying,
p18
aVbut it really should concern you.
p19
aVIt does concern you, as well.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,"
p22
aVasking why we didn't do something on our watch
p23
aVto save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean
p24
aVwhile there still was time.
p25
aVWell, now is that time.
p26
aVI hope for your help
p27
aVto explore and protect the wild ocean
p28
aVin ways that will restore the health and,
p29
aVin so doing, secure hope for humankind.
p30
aVHealth to the ocean means health for us.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales
p33
aVand other sea creatures
p34
aVin this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
p35
aVAnd I hope, Jill, that someday
p36
aVwe will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VDid I say that? I guess I did.
p41
aa(lp42
VFor me, as a scientist,
p43
aVit all began in 1953
p44
aVwhen I first tried scuba.
p45
aVIt's when I first got to know fish swimming
p46
aVin something other than lemon slices and butter.
p47
aVI actually love diving at night;
p48
aVyou see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.
p49
aVDiving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,
p50
aVwhen I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time \u2014
p51
aVat the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
p52
aVIn 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor
p53
aVwhile using this personal submersible called Jim.
p54
aVIt was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
p55
aVIt's one of my favorite bathing suits.
p56
aa(lp57
VSince then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines
p58
aVand I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search
p59
aVto design and build systems
p60
aVto access the deep sea.
p61
aVI led a five-year National Geographic expedition,
p62
aVthe Sustainable Seas expeditions,
p63
aVusing these little subs.
p64
aVThey're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.
p65
aVAnd I'm living proof.
p66
aVAstronauts and aquanauts alike
p67
aVreally appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature \u2014
p68
aVall the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
p69
aVI heard astronaut Joe Allen explain
p70
aVhow he had to learn everything he could about his life support system
p71
aVand then do everything he could
p72
aVto take care of his life support system;
p73
aVand then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
p74
aVWe need to learn everything we can about it
p75
aVand do everything we can to take care of it.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;
p78
aVnone without water."
p79
aVNinety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.
p80
aVNo blue, no green.
p81
aVIf you think the ocean isn't important,
p82
aVimagine Earth without it.
p83
aVMars comes to mind.
p84
aVNo ocean, no life support system.
p85
aVI gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank
p86
aVand I showed this amazing image of Earth
p87
aVand I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"
p88
aVThat's where all the assets are!
p89
aVAnd we've been trawling them down
p90
aVmuch faster than the natural systems can replenish them.
p91
aa(lp92
VTim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.
p93
aVWith every drop of water you drink,
p94
aVevery breath you take,
p95
aVyou're connected to the sea.
p96
aVNo matter where on Earth you live.
p97
aVMost of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.
p98
aVOver time, most of the planet's organic carbon
p99
aVhas been absorbed and stored there,
p100
aVmostly by microbes.
p101
aVThe ocean drives climate and weather,
p102
aVstabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.
p103
aVWater from the sea forms clouds
p104
aVthat return to the land and the seas
p105
aVas rain, sleet and snow,
p106
aVand provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,
p107
aVmaybe in the universe.
p108
aVNo water, no life;
p109
aVno blue, no green.
p110
aa(lp111
VYet we have this idea, we humans,
p112
aVthat the Earth \u2014 all of it: the oceans, the skies \u2014
p113
aVare so vast and so resilient
p114
aVit doesn't matter what we do to it.
p115
aVThat may have been true 10,000 years ago,
p116
aVand maybe even 1,000 years ago
p117
aVbut in the last 100, especially in the last 50,
p118
aVwe've drawn down the assets,
p119
aVthe air, the water, the wildlife
p120
aVthat make our lives possible.
p121
aVNew technologies are helping us to understand
p122
aVthe nature of nature;
p123
aVthe nature of what's happening,
p124
aVshowing us our impact on the Earth.
p125
aVI mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.
p126
aVAnd fortunately, in our time,
p127
aVwe've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.
p128
aVAnd with knowing comes caring.
p129
aVAnd with caring, there's hope
p130
aVthat we can find an enduring place for ourselves
p131
aVwithin the natural systems that support us.
p132
aVBut first we have to know.
p133
aa(lp134
VThree years ago, I met John Hanke,
p135
aVwho's the head of Google Earth,
p136
aVand I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands
p137
aVand go exploring vicariously.
p138
aVBut I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?
p139
aVYou did a great job with the land, the dirt.
p140
aVWhat about the water?"
p141
aVSince then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,
p142
aVwith DOER Marine, with National Geographic,
p143
aVwith dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,
p144
aVones that we could enlist,
p145
aVto put the ocean in Google Earth.
p146
aVAnd as of just this week, last Monday,
p147
aVGoogle Earth is now whole.
p148
aa(lp149
VConsider this: Starting right here at the convention center,
p150
aVwe can find the nearby aquarium,
p151
aVwe can look at where we're sitting,
p152
aVand then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,
p153
aVand California's four national marine sanctuaries,
p154
aVand the new network of state marine reserves
p155
aVthat are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets
p156
aVWe can flit over to Hawaii
p157
aVand see the real Hawaiian Islands:
p158
aVnot just the little bit that pokes through the surface,
p159
aVbut also what's below.
p160
aVTo see \u2014 wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! \u2014
p161
aVright there, ha \u2014
p162
aVunder the ocean, see what the whales see.
p163
aVWe can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.
p164
aVWe can go actually and swim around on Google Earth
p165
aVand visit with humpback whales.
p166
aVThese are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face
p167
aVmany times underwater.
p168
aVThere's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe can pick up and fly to the deepest place:
p171
aVseven miles down, the Mariana Trench,
p172
aVwhere only two people have ever been.
p173
aVImagine that. It's only seven miles,
p174
aVbut only two people have been there, 49 years ago.
p175
aVOne-way trips are easy.
p176
aVWe need new deep-diving submarines.
p177
aVHow about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?
p178
aVWe need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,
p179
aVand understand life in the deep sea.
p180
aa(lp181
VWe can now go to the Arctic.
p182
aVJust ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.
p183
aVAn ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.
p184
aVThat's bad news for the polar bears.
p185
aVThat's bad news for us too.
p186
aVExcess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,
p187
aVit's also changing ocean chemistry,
p188
aVmaking the sea more acidic.
p189
aVThat's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
p190
aVAlso it's bad news for us.
p191
aVWe're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic
p192
aVand other trash into the sea.
p193
aVMillions of tons of discarded fishing nets,
p194
aVgear that continues to kill.
p195
aVWe're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,
p196
aVand we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,
p197
aVall carbon-based units.
p198
aVBarbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,
p199
aVundermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry
p200
aVand drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,
p201
aVthe oxygen cycle, the water cycle \u2014
p202
aVour life support system.
p203
aVWe're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered
p204
aVand much more valuable alive than dead.
p205
aVAll of these parts are part of our life support system.
p206
aVWe kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet
p207
aVthat may stretch for 50 miles or more.
p208
aVIndustrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor
p209
aVlike bulldozers, taking everything in their path.
p210
aa(lp211
VUsing Google Earth you can witness trawlers \u2014
p212
aVin China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico \u2014
p213
aVshaking the foundation of our life support system,
p214
aVleaving plumes of death in their path.
p215
aVThe next time you dine on sushi \u2014 or sashimi,
p216
aVor swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,
p217
aVwhatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean \u2014
p218
aVthink of the real cost.
p219
aVFor every pound that goes to market,
p220
aVmore than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,
p221
aVmay be thrown away as bycatch.
p222
aVThis is the consequence of not knowing
p223
aVthat there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
p224
aVThis chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife
p225
aVfrom 1900 to 2000.
p226
aVThe highest concentrations are in red.
p227
aVIn my lifetime, imagine,
p228
aV90 percent of the big fish have been killed.
p229
aVMost of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales
p230
aVare way down in numbers.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut, there is good news.
p233
aVTen percent of the big fish still remain.
p234
aVThere are still some blue whales.
p235
aVThere are still some krill in Antarctica.
p236
aVThere are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.
p237
aVHalf the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,
p238
aVa jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.
p239
aVThere's still time, but not a lot,
p240
aVto turn things around.
p241
aVBut business as usual means that in 50 years,
p242
aVthere may be no coral reefs \u2014
p243
aVand no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
p244
aVImagine the ocean without fish.
p245
aVImagine what that means to our life support system.
p246
aVNatural systems on the land are in big trouble too,
p247
aVbut the problems are more obvious,
p248
aVand some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,
p251
aVthe United States began establishing a system of parks
p252
aVthat some say was the best idea America ever had.
p253
aVAbout 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:
p254
aVsafeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,
p255
aVgenerating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
p256
aVAnd, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,
p257
aVNational Marine Sanctuaries.
p258
aVThat's another great idea.
p259
aVThe good news is
p260
aVthat there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,
p261
aVthat have some kind of protection.
p262
aVAnd you can find them on Google Earth.
p263
aVThe bad news is
p264
aVthat you have to look hard to find them.
p265
aVIn the last three years, for example,
p266
aVthe U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
p267
aVBut it only increased from 0.6 of one percent
p268
aVto 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
p269
aVProtected areas do rebound,
p270
aVbut it takes a long time to restore
p271
aV50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,
p272
aVor 200-year-old orange roughy.
p273
aVWe don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
p274
aVProtected areas provide hope
p275
aVthat the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream
p276
aVof an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,
p277
aVwill live not just as a list,
p278
aVa photograph, or a paragraph.
p279
aa(lp280
VWith scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean
p281
aVthat is open to fishing \u2014 and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever \u2014
p282
aVto search out hope spots,
p283
aVand try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
p284
aVSuch as the Arctic \u2014
p285
aVwe have one chance, right now, to get it right.
p286
aVOr the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,
p287
aVbut the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.
p288
aVSargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest
p289
aVis being gathered up to feed cows.
p290
aV97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,
p291
aVbut the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
p292
aVIt's true too in Argentina
p293
aVon the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.
p294
aVThe high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel \u2014
p295
aVthe largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,
p296
aVfilled with luminous creatures,
p297
aVliving in dark waters that average two miles deep.
p298
aVThey flash, and sparkle, and glow
p299
aVwith their own living light.
p300
aa(lp301
VThere are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.
p302
aVThe next 10 years may be the most important,
p303
aVand the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have
p304
aVto protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
p305
aVTo cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.
p306
aVWe need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
p307
aVWe need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
p308
aVBut, nothing else will matter
p309
aVif we fail to protect the ocean.
p310
aVOur fate and the ocean's are one.
p311
aVWe need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.
p312
aa(lp313
VA global plan of action
p314
aVwith a world conservation union, the IUCN,
p315
aVis underway to protect biodiversity,
p316
aVto mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,
p317
aVon the high seas and in coastal areas,
p318
aVwherever we can identify critical places.
p319
aVNew technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore
p320
aVthe 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.
p321
aVThe goal is to protect biodiversity,
p322
aVto provide stability and resilience.
p323
aVWe need deep-diving subs,
p324
aVnew technologies to explore the ocean.
p325
aVWe need, maybe, an expedition \u2014
p326
aVa TED at sea \u2014
p327
aVthat could help figure out the next steps.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.
p330
aVI wish you would use all means at your disposal \u2014
p331
aVfilms, expeditions, the web, new submarines \u2014
p332
aVand campaign to ignite public support
p333
aVfor a global network of marine protected areas \u2014
p334
aVhope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,
p335
aVthe blue heart of the planet.
p336
aVHow much?
p337
aVSome say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
p338
aVYou decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
p339
aVWhatever it is,
p340
aVa fraction of one percent is not enough.
p341
aVMy wish is a big wish,
p342
aVbut if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,
p343
aVand help ensure the survival
p344
aVof what actually \u2014 as it turns out \u2014 is my favorite species;
p345
aVthat would be us.
p346
aVFor the children of today,
