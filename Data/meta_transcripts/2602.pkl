VTrevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars" first hit the airwaves,
p8
aVthat is not what it looked like.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VJeff and I were full-time ballroom dance instructors
p13
aVwhen the big TV ballroom revival hit,
p14
aVand this was incredible.
p15
aVI mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"
p16
aVand people were like "Foxes trotting."
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd the next day they were telling us
p21
aVthe finer points of a good feather step.
p22
aVAnd this blew our minds.
p23
aVI mean, all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done
p24
aVon why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba
p25
aVand why tango traveled unlike the waltz,
p26
aVall of that just hit the public consciousness,
p27
aVand it changed everything.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut running parallel to this excitement,
p30
aVthe excitement that suddenly, somehow, we were cool \u2014
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
Vthere was also this reservation.
p35
aVWhy this and why now?
p36
aa(lp37
VJeff Fox: When Trevor and I would get together for training seminars
p38
aVor just for fun,
p39
aVwe'd toss each other around, mix it up,
p40
aVtake a break from having to lead all the time.
p41
aVWe even came up with a system for switching lead and follow
p42
aVwhile we were dancing,
p43
aVas a way of taking turns and playing fair.
p44
aVIt wasn't until we used that system as part of a performance
p45
aVin a small festival
p46
aVthat we got an important tap on the shoulder.
p47
aVLisa O'Connell, a dramaturge and director of a playwright center,
p48
aVpulled us aside after the show and said,
p49
aV"Do you have any idea how political that was?"
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo that began an eight-year collaboration to create a play
p54
aVwhich not only further developed our system for switching
p55
aVbut also explored the impact of being locked into a single role,
p56
aVand what's worse,
p57
aVbeing defined by that single role.
p58
aa(lp59
VTC: Because, of course,
p60
aVclassic Latin and ballroom dancing isn't just a system of dancing;
p61
aVit's a way of thinking, of being,
p62
aVof relating to each other
p63
aVthat captured a whole period's values.
p64
aVThere's one thing that stayed consistent, though:
p65
aVthe man leads
p66
aVand the woman follows.
p67
aVSo street salsa, championship tango, it's all the same \u2014
p68
aVhe leads, she follows.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo this was gender training.
p71
aVYou weren't just learning to dance \u2014
p72
aVyou were learning to "man" and to "woman."
p73
aVIt's a relic.
p74
aVAnd in the way of relics, you don't throw it out,
p75
aVbut you need to know that this is the past.
p76
aVThis isn't the present.
p77
aVIt's like Shakespeare: respect it, revive it \u2014 great!
p78
aVBut know that this is history.
p79
aVThis doesn't represent how we think today.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo we asked ourselves:
p82
aVIf you strip it all down,
p83
aVwhat is at the core of partner dancing?
p84
aa(lp85
VJF: Well, the core principle of partner dancing
p86
aVis that one person leads, the other one follows.
p87
aVThe machine works the same, regardless of who's playing which role.
p88
aVThe physics of movement doesn't really give a crap about your gender.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VSo if we were to update the existing form,
p93
aVwe would need to make it more representative
p94
aVof how we interact here, now, in 2015.
p95
aVWhen you watch ballroom, don't just watch what's there.
p96
aVWatch what's not.
p97
aVThe couple is always only a man and a woman.
p98
aVTogether.
p99
aVOnly.
p100
aVEver.
p101
aVSo, same-sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear.
p102
aVIn most mainstream international ballroom competitions,
p103
aVsame-sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor,
p104
aVand in many cases,
p105
aVthe rules prohibit them completely.
p106
aa(lp107
VTC: Try this: Google-image, "professional Latin dancer,"
p108
aVand then look for an actual Latino person.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VYou'll be there for days.
p113
aVWhat you will get is page after page of white, straight Russian couples
p114
aVspray-tanned to the point of mahogany.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VThere are no black people, there are no Asians,
p119
aVno mixed-race couples,
p120
aVso basically, non-white people just disappeared.
p121
aa(lp122
VEven within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm \u2014
p123
aVshe can't be taller,
p124
aVhe can't be shorter.
p125
aVShe can't be bolder,
p126
aVhe can't be gentler.
p127
aa(lp128
VIf you were to take a ballroom dance
p129
aVand translate that into a conversation
p130
aVand drop that into a movie,
p131
aVwe, as a culture, would never stand for this.
p132
aVHe dictates, she reacts.
p133
aVNo relationship \u2014 gay, straight or anything \u2014
p134
aVthat we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that,
p135
aVand yet somehow,
p136
aVyou put it on prime time, you slap some makeup on it,
p137
aVthrow the glitter on, put it out there as movement, not as text,
p138
aVand we, as a culture,
p139
aVtune in and clap.
p140
aVWe are applauding our own absence.
p141
aVToo many people have disappeared from partner dancing.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Music)
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VJF: Now, you just saw two men dancing together.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd you thought it looked ...
p152
aVa little strange.
p153
aVInteresting \u2014 appealing, even \u2014
p154
aVbut a little bit odd.
p155
aVEven avid followers of the same-sex ballroom circuit can attest
p156
aVthat while same-sex partner dancing can be dynamic and strong and exciting,
p157
aVit just doesn't quite seem to fit.
p158
aVAesthetically speaking,
p159
aVif Alida and I take the classic closed ballroom hold ...
p160
aVthis is considered beautiful.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VBut why not this?
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VSee, the standard image that the leader must be larger and masculine
p169
aVand the follower smaller and feminine \u2014
p170
aVthis is a stumbling point.
p171
aa(lp172
VTC: So we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle.
p173
aVSo, what if we could keep the idea of lead and follow
p174
aVbut toss the idea that this was connected to gender?
p175
aVFurther, what if a couple could lead and follow each other
p176
aVand then switch?
p177
aVAnd then switch back?
p178
aVWhat if it could be like a conversation,
p179
aVtaking turns listening and speaking, just like we do in life?
p180
aVWhat if we could dance like that?
p181
aVWe call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."
p182
aa(lp183
VJF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,
p184
aVsalsa.
p185
aVIn salsa, there's a key transitional step, called the cross-body lead.
p186
aVWe use it as punctuation to break up the improvisation.
p187
aVIt can be a little tricky to spot if you're not used to looking for it,
p188
aVso here it is.
p189
aVOne more time for the cheap seats.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd here's the action one more time,
p194
aVnice and slow.
p195
aVNow, if we apply liquid-lead thinking to this transitional step,
p196
aVthe cross-body lead becomes a point
p197
aVwhere the lead and the follow can switch.
p198
aVThe person following can elect to take over the lead,
p199
aVor the person leading can choose to surrender it,
p200
aVessentially making it a counter-cross-body lead.
p201
aVHere's how that looks in slow motion.
p202
aVAnd here's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance.
p203
aa(lp204
VWith this simple tweak, the dance moves from being a dictation
p205
aVto a negotiation.
p206
aVAnyone can lead. Anyone can follow.
p207
aVAnd more importantly, you can change your mind.
p208
aVNow, this is only one example of how this applies,
p209
aVbut once the blinkers come off, anything can happen.
p210
aa(lp211
VTC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking could apply to a classic waltz.
p212
aVBecause, of course,
p213
aVit isn't just a system of switching leads;
p214
aVit's a way of thinking
p215
aVthat can actually make the dance itself more efficient.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo: the waltz.
p218
aVThe waltz is a turning dance.
p219
aVThis means that for the lead,
p220
aVyou spend half of the dance traveling backwards,
p221
aVcompletely blind.
p222
aVAnd because of the follower's position,
p223
aVbasically, no one can see where they're going.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VSo you're out here on the floor,
p228
aVand then imagine that coming right at you.
p229
aa(lp230
VJF: Raaaaaah!
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VTC: There are actually a lot of accidents out there
p235
aVthat happen as a result of this blind spot.
p236
aVBut what if the partners were to just allow for
p237
aVa switch of posture for a moment?
p238
aVA lot of accidents could be avoided.
p239
aVEven if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen,
p240
aVit would be a lot safer,
p241
aVwhile at the same time, offering new aesthetics into the waltz.
p242
aVBecause physics doesn't give a damn about your gender.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VJF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead in clubs, convention centers
p247
aVand as part of "First Dance," the play we created with Lisa,
p248
aVon stages in North America and in Europe.
p249
aVAnd it never fails to engage.
p250
aVI mean, beyond the unusual sight of seeing two men dancing together,
p251
aVit always evokes and engages.
p252
aVBut why?
p253
aa(lp254
VThe secret lies in what made Lisa see our initial demonstration
p255
aVas "political."
p256
aVIt wasn't just that we were switching lead and follow;
p257
aVit's that we stayed consistent in our presence, our personality
p258
aVand our power, regardless of which role we were playing.
p259
aVWe were still us.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd that's where the true freedom lies \u2014
p262
aVnot just the freedom to switch roles,
p263
aVbut the freedom from being defined by whichever role you're playing,
p264
aVthe freedom to always remain true to yourself.
p265
aVForget what a lead is supposed to look like, or a follow.
p266
aVBe a masculine follow
p267
aVor a feminine lead.
p268
aVJust be yourself.
p269
aVObviously, this applies off the dance floor as well,
p270
aVbut on the floor, it gives us the perfect opportunity
p271
aVto update an old paradigm, reinvigorate an old relic,
p272
aVand make it more representative of our era and our current way of being.
p273
aa(lp274
VTC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing all the time with women and men
p275
aVand we love it.
p276
aVBut we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form
p277
aVthat can produce silence and produce invisibility
p278
aVacross the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today.
p279
aVWe invented Liquid Lead
p280
aVas a way of stripping out all the ideas that don't belong to us
p281
aVand taking partner dancing back to what it really always was:
p282
aVthe fine art of taking care of each other.
