VImagining a solo cello concert,
p10
aVone would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach
p11
aVunaccompanied cello suites.
p12
aVAs a child
p13
aVstudying these eternal masterpieces,
p14
aVBach's music would intermingle
p15
aVwith the singing voices of Muslim prayers
p16
aVfrom the neighboring Arab village
p17
aVof the northern Kibbutz in Israel
p18
aVwhere I grew up.
p19
aVLate at night, after hours of practicing,
p20
aVI would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday
p21
aVas the sounds of tango music
p22
aVwould be creeping from my parents' stereo.
p23
aVIt all became music to me.
p24
aVI didn't hear the boundaries.
p25
aa(lp26
VI still start every day
p27
aVpracticing playing Bach.
p28
aVHis music never ceases
p29
aVto sound fresh and surprising to me.
p30
aVBut as I was moving away
p31
aVfrom the traditional classical repertoire
p32
aVand trying to find new ways
p33
aVof musical expression,
p34
aVI realized that with today's technological resources,
p35
aVthere's no reason to limit
p36
aVwhat can be produced at one time
p37
aVfrom a single string instrument.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe power and coherency
p40
aVthat comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices
p41
aVmakes a very different experience.
p42
aVThe excitement of a great orchestra performance
p43
aVcomes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians
p44
aVproducing one unified whole concept.
p45
aVThe excitement from using multi-tracking,
p46
aVthe way I did in the piece you will hear next,
p47
aVcomes from the attempt
p48
aVto build and create a whole universe
p49
aVwith many diverse layers,
p50
aVall generated from a single source.
p51
aVMy cello and my voice are layered
p52
aVto create this large sonic canvas.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhen composers write music for me,
p55
aVI ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
p56
aVI hope to arrive at new territories
p57
aVto discover sounds I have never heard before.
p58
aVI want to create endless possibilities
p59
aVwith this cello.
p60
aVI become the medium through which the music is being channeled,
p61
aVand in the process, when all is right,
p62
aVthe music is transformed
p63
aVand so am I.
