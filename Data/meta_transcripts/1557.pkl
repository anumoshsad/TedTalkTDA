VI want you to imagine this for a moment.
p4
aVTwo men, Rahul and Rajiv,
p5
aVliving in the same neighborhood,
p6
aVfrom the same educational background, similar occupation,
p7
aVand they both turn up at their local accident emergency
p8
aVcomplaining of acute chest pain.
p9
aVRahul is offered a cardiac procedure,
p10
aVbut Rajiv is sent home.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat might explain the difference in the experience
p13
aVof these two nearly identical men?
p14
aVRajiv suffers from a mental illness.
p15
aVThe difference in the quality of medical care
p16
aVreceived by people with mental illness is one of the reasons
p17
aVwhy they live shorter lives
p18
aVthan people without mental illness.
p19
aVEven in the best-resourced countries in the world,
p20
aVthis life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.
p21
aVIn the developing countries of the world, this gap
p22
aVis even larger.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways
p25
aVas well. The most obvious example is suicide.
p26
aVIt might surprise some of you here, as it did me,
p27
aVwhen I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list
p28
aVof the leading causes of death in young people
p29
aVin all countries in the world,
p30
aVincluding the poorest countries of the world.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut beyond the impact of a health condition
p33
aVon life expectancy, we're also concerned
p34
aVabout the quality of life lived.
p35
aVNow, in order for us to examine the overall impact
p36
aVof a health condition both on life expectancy
p37
aVas well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use
p38
aVa metric called the DALY,
p39
aVwhich stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.
p40
aVNow when we do that, we discover some startling things
p41
aVabout mental illness from a global perspective.
p42
aVWe discover that, for example, mental illnesses are
p43
aVamongst the leading causes of disability around the world.
p44
aVDepression, for example, is the third-leading cause
p45
aVof disability, alongside conditions such as
p46
aVdiarrhea and pneumonia in children.
p47
aVWhen you put all the mental illnesses together,
p48
aVthey account for roughly 15 percent
p49
aVof the total global burden of disease.
p50
aVIndeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging
p51
aVto people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,
p52
aVlet us consider the absolute numbers.
p53
aVThe World Health Organization estimates
p54
aVthat there are nearly four to five hundred million people
p55
aVliving on our tiny planet
p56
aVwho are affected by a mental illness.
p57
aVNow some of you here
p58
aVlook a bit astonished by that number,
p59
aVbut consider for a moment the incredible diversity
p60
aVof mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability
p61
aVin childhood, through to depression and anxiety,
p62
aVsubstance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,
p63
aVall the way through to dementia in old age,
p64
aVand I'm pretty sure that each and every one us
p65
aVpresent here today can think of at least one person,
p66
aVat least one person, who's affected by mental illness
p67
aVin our most intimate social networks.
p68
aVI see some nodding heads there.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut beyond the staggering numbers,
p71
aVwhat's truly important from a global health point of view,
p72
aVwhat's truly worrying from a global health point of view,
p73
aVis that the vast majority of these affected individuals
p74
aVdo not receive the care
p75
aVthat we know can transform their lives, and remember,
p76
aVwe do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,
p77
aVmedicines, psychological interventions,
p78
aVand social interventions, can make a vast difference.
p79
aVAnd yet, even in the best-resourced countries,
p80
aVfor example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent
p81
aVof affected people don't receive these interventions.
p82
aVIn the sorts of countries I work in,
p83
aVthat so-called treatment gap
p84
aVapproaches an astonishing 90 percent.
p85
aVIt isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak
p86
aVto anyone affected by a mental illness,
p87
aVthe chances are that you will hear stories
p88
aVof hidden suffering, shame and discrimination
p89
aVin nearly every sector of their lives.
p90
aVBut perhaps most heartbreaking of all
p91
aVare the stories of the abuse
p92
aVof even the most basic human rights,
p93
aVsuch as the young woman shown in this image here
p94
aVthat are played out every day,
p95
aVsadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care
p96
aVfor people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's this injustice that has really driven my mission
p99
aVto try to do a little bit to transform the lives
p100
aVof people affected by mental illness, and a particularly
p101
aVcritical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf
p102
aVbetween the knowledge we have that can transform lives,
p103
aVthe knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually
p104
aVuse that knowledge in the everyday world.
p105
aVAnd an especially important challenge that I've had to face
p106
aVis the great shortage of mental health professionals,
p107
aVsuch as psychiatrists and psychologists,
p108
aVparticularly in the developing world.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow I trained in medicine in India, and after that
p111
aVI chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay
p112
aVof my mother and all my family members who
p113
aVkind of thought neurosurgery would be
p114
aVa more respectable option for their brilliant son.
p115
aVAny case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,
p116
aVand found myself training in Britain in some of
p117
aVthe best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.
p118
aVI worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,
p119
aVbut most importantly, highly trained, specialized
p120
aVmental health professionals.
p121
aa(lp122
VSoon after my training, I found myself working
p123
aVfirst in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted
p124
aVby an altogether new reality.
p125
aVThis was a reality of a world in which there were almost no
p126
aVmental health professionals at all.
p127
aVIn Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about
p128
aVa dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked
p129
aVin Harare city, leaving only a couple
p130
aVto address the mental health care needs
p131
aVof nine million people living in the countryside.
p132
aa(lp133
VIn India, I found the situation was not a lot better.
p134
aVTo give you a perspective, if I had to translate
p135
aVthe proportion of psychiatrists in the population
p136
aVthat one might see in Britain to India,
p137
aVone might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.
p138
aVIn reality, take a guess.
p139
aVThe actual number is about 3,000,
p140
aVabout two percent of that number.
p141
aa(lp142
VIt became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow
p143
aVthe sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,
p144
aVone that relied heavily on specialized, expensive
p145
aVmental health professionals to provide mental health care
p146
aVin countries like India and Zimbabwe.
p147
aVI had to think out of the box about some other model
p148
aVof care.
p149
aa(lp150
VIt was then that I came across these books,
p151
aVand in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting
p152
aVin global health.
p153
aVThe idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,
p154
aVwhen you're short of specialized health care professionals,
p155
aVuse whoever is available in the community,
p156
aVtrain them to provide a range of health care interventions,
p157
aVand in these books I read inspiring examples,
p158
aVfor example of how ordinary people had been trained
p159
aVto deliver babies,
p160
aVdiagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.
p161
aVAnd it struck me that if you could train ordinary people
p162
aVto deliver such complex health care interventions,
p163
aVthen perhaps they could also do the same
p164
aVwith mental health care.
p165
aa(lp166
VWell today, I'm very pleased to report to you
p167
aVthat there have been many experiments in task shifting
p168
aVin mental health care across the developing world
p169
aVover the past decade, and I want to share with you
p170
aVthe findings of three particular such experiments,
p171
aVall three of which focused on depression,
p172
aVthe most common of all mental illnesses.
p173
aVIn rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,
p174
aVusing villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver
p175
aVinterpersonal psychotherapy for depression
p176
aVand, using a randomized control design,
p177
aVshowed that 90 percent of the people receiving
p178
aVthis intervention recovered as compared
p179
aVto roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.
p180
aVSimilarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,
p181
aVAtif Rahman and his colleagues showed
p182
aVthat lady health visitors, who are community maternal
p183
aVhealth workers in Pakistan's health care system,
p184
aVcould deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers
p185
aVwho were depressed, again showing dramatic differences
p186
aVin the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers
p187
aVrecovered as compared to about 45 percent
p188
aVin the comparison villages.
p189
aVAnd in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed
p190
aVthat lay counselors drawn from local communities
p191
aVcould be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions
p192
aVfor depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent
p193
aVrecovery rates as compared to 50 percent
p194
aVin the comparison primary health centers.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, if I had to draw together all these different
p197
aVexperiments in task shifting, and there have of course
p198
aVbeen many other examples, and try and identify
p199
aVwhat are the key lessons we can learn that makes
p200
aVfor a successful task shifting operation,
p201
aVI have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.
p202
aVWhat SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."
p203
aVIt seems to me that there are five key lessons
p204
aVthat I've shown on this slide that are critically important
p205
aVfor effective task shifting.
p206
aVThe first is that we need to simplify the message
p207
aVthat we're using, stripping away all the jargon
p208
aVthat medicine has invented around itself.
p209
aVWe need to unpack complex health care interventions
p210
aVinto smaller components that can be more easily
p211
aVtransferred to less-trained individuals.
p212
aVWe need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,
p213
aVbut close to people's homes, and we need to deliver
p214
aVhealth care using whoever is available and affordable
p215
aVin our local communities.
p216
aVAnd importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists
p217
aVwho are available to perform roles
p218
aVsuch as capacity-building and supervision.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow for me, task shifting is an idea
p221
aVwith truly global significance,
p222
aVbecause even though it has arisen out of the
p223
aVsituation of the lack of resources that you find
p224
aVin developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance
p225
aVfor better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?
p226
aVWell, in part, because health care in the developed world,
p227
aVthe health care costs in the [developed] world,
p228
aVare rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk
p229
aVof those costs are human resource costs.
p230
aVBut equally important is because health care has become
p231
aVso incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote
p232
aVand removed from local communities.
p233
aVFor me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,
p234
aVthough, isn't that it simply makes health care
p235
aVmore accessible and affordable but that
p236
aVit is also fundamentally empowering.
p237
aVIt empowers ordinary people to be more effective
p238
aVin caring for the health of others in their community,
p239
aVand in doing so, to become better guardians
p240
aVof their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting
p241
aVis the ultimate example of the democratization
p242
aVof medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.
p243
aa(lp244
VJust over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled
p245
aVat Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.
p246
aVWell, I think all of you can guess
p247
aVthat 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.
p248
aVStill, today, armed with that knowledge
p249
aVthat ordinary people in the community
p250
aVcan be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,
p251
aVcan deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,
p252
aVperhaps that promise is within reach now.
p253
aVIndeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,
p254
aVwe will need to involve all
p255
aVin that particular journey,
p256
aVand in the case of mental health, in particular we would
p257
aVneed to involve people who are affected by mental illness
p258
aVand their caregivers.
p259
aa(lp260
VIt is for this reason that, some years ago,
p261
aVthe Movement for Global Mental Health was founded
p262
aVas a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals
p263
aVlike myself and people affected by mental illness
p264
aVcould stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,
p265
aVand advocate for the rights of people with mental illness
p266
aVto receive the care that we know can transform their lives,
p267
aVand to live a life with dignity.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet
p270
aVin these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,
p271
aVspare a thought for that person you thought about
p272
aVwho has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about
p273
aVwho have mental illness,
p274
aVand dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)
