VMeet Tony. He's my student.
p4
aVHe's about my age,
p5
aVand he's in San Quentin State Prison.
p6
aVWhen Tony was 16 years old,
p7
aVone day, one moment,
p8
aV"It was mom's gun.
p9
aVJust flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.
p10
aVHe took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.
p11
aVThen last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'
p12
aVMy buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'
p13
aVI say, 'Let's do this.'"
p14
aVAnd those three words, Tony's going to remember,
p15
aVbecause the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.
p16
aVThere's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.
p17
aVAnd that's felony murder \u2014
p18
aV25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,
p19
aVand Tony's not feeling very lucky.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison
p22
aVand I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"
p23
aVTony interrupts me.
p24
aV"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?
p25
aVI know what is wrong. I have done wrong.
p26
aVI am told every day,
p27
aVby every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.
p28
aVIf I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.
p29
aVI'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'
p30
aVWhat are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I say to Tony,
p33
aV"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.
p34
aVYou think you know right and wrong?
p35
aVThen can you tell me what wrong is?
p36
aVNo, don't just give me an example.
p37
aVI want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.
p38
aVWhat is that idea?
p39
aVWhat makes something wrong?
p40
aVHow do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.
p41
aVMaybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.
p42
aVMaybe it's you, maybe it's me \u2014 but we're not here to trade opinions;
p43
aVeveryone's got an opinion.
p44
aVWe are here for knowledge.
p45
aVOur enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd something changes for Tony.
p48
aV"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.
p49
aVI want to know what is wrong.
p50
aVI want to know what I know."
p51
aVWhat Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,
p52
aVthe project that begins in wonder \u2014
p53
aVwhat Kant called "admiration and awe
p54
aVat the starry sky above and the moral law within."
p55
aVWhat can creatures like us know of such things?
p56
aVIt is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence \u2014
p57
aVwhat Heidegger called "the always already there."
p58
aVIt is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it \u2014
p59
aVwhat Socrates called "the examined life."
p60
aVSocrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.
p61
aVSocrates died in prison,
p62
aVhis philosophy intact.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo Tony starts doing his homework.
p65
aVHe learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,
p66
aVhis logic, his fallacies.
p67
aVTurns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.
p68
aVHis body is in prison, but his mind is free.
p69
aVTony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,
p70
aVthe epistemologically anxious,
p71
aVthe ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.
p72
aVThat's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche
p73
aVand Bill Clinton.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo when he gives me his final paper,
p76
aVin which he argues that the categorical imperative
p77
aVis perhaps too uncompromising
p78
aVto deal with the conflict that affects our everyday
p79
aVand challenges me to tell him
p80
aVwhether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,
p81
aVI say, "I don't know.
p82
aVLet us think about that."
p83
aVBecause in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;
p84
aVit's just the two of us standing there.
p85
aVIt is not professor and convict,
p86
aVit is just two minds ready to do philosophy.
p87
aVAnd I say to Tony,
p88
aV"Let's do this."
p89
aa(lp90
VThank you.
