VA little over 100 years ago, in 1915,
p4
aVEinstein published his theory of general relativity,
p5
aVwhich is sort of a strange name,
p6
aVbut it's a theory that explains gravity.
p7
aVIt states that mass \u2014 all matter, the planets \u2014 attracts mass,
p8
aVnot because of an instantaneous force, as Newton claimed,
p9
aVbut because all matter \u2014 all of us, all the planets \u2014
p10
aVwrinkles the flexible fabric of space-time.
p11
aa(lp12
VSpace-time is this thing in which we live and that connects us all.
p13
aVIt's like when we lie down on a mattress and distort its contour.
p14
aVThe masses move \u2014 again, not according to Newton's laws,
p15
aVbut because they see this space-time curvature
p16
aVand follow the little curves,
p17
aVjust like when our bedmate nestles up to us
p18
aVbecause of the mattress curvature.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VA year later, in 1916,
p23
aVEinstein derived from his theory
p24
aVthat gravitational waves existed,
p25
aVand that these waves were produced when masses move,
p26
aVlike, for example, when two stars revolve around one another
p27
aVand create folds in space-time which carry energy from the system,
p28
aVand the stars move toward each other.
p29
aVHowever, he also estimated
p30
aVthat these effects were so minute,
p31
aVthat it would never be possible to measure them.
p32
aVI'm going to tell you the story of how,
p33
aVwith the work of hundreds of scientists working in many countries
p34
aVover the course of many decades,
p35
aVjust recently, in 2015,
p36
aVwe discovered those gravitational waves for the first time.
p37
aa(lp38
VIt's a rather long story.
p39
aVIt started 1.3 billion years ago.
p40
aVA long, long time ago,
p41
aVin a galaxy far, far away \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
Vtwo black holes were revolving around one another \u2014
p46
aV"dancing the tango," I like to say.
p47
aVIt started slowly,
p48
aVbut as they emitted gravitational waves,
p49
aVthey grew closer together, accelerating in speed,
p50
aVuntil, when they were revolving at almost the speed of light,
p51
aVthey fused into a single black hole
p52
aVthat had 60 times the mass of the Sun,
p53
aVbut compressed into the space of 360 kilometers.
p54
aVThat's the size of the state of Louisiana,
p55
aVwhere I live.
p56
aVThis incredible effect produced gravitational waves
p57
aVthat carried the news of this cosmic hug to the rest of the universe.
p58
aa(lp59
VIt took us a long time to figure out the effects of these gravitational waves,
p60
aVbecause the way we measure them is by looking for effects in distances.
p61
aVWe want to measure longitudes, distances.
p62
aVWhen these gravitational waves passed by Earth,
p63
aVwhich was in 2015,
p64
aVthey produced changes in all distances \u2014
p65
aVthe distances between all of you, the distances between you and me,
p66
aVour heights \u2014
p67
aVevery one of us stretched and shrank a tiny bit.
p68
aVThe prediction is that the effect is proportional to the distance.
p69
aVBut it's very small:
p70
aVeven for distances much greater than my slight height,
p71
aVthe effect is infinitesimal.
p72
aVFor example, the distance between the Earth and the Sun
p73
aVchanged by one atomic diameter.
p74
aVHow can that be measured?
p75
aVHow could we measure it?
p76
aa(lp77
VFifty years ago,
p78
aVsome visionary physicists at Caltech and MIT \u2014
p79
aVKip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss \u2014
p80
aVthought they could precisely measure distances
p81
aVusing lasers that measured distances between mirrors
p82
aVkilometers apart.
p83
aVIt took many years, a lot of work and many scientists
p84
aVto develop the technology and develop the ideas.
p85
aVAnd 20 years later,
p86
aValmost 30 years ago,
p87
aVthey started to build two gravitational wave detectors, two interferometers,
p88
aVin the United States.
p89
aVEach one is four kilometers long;
p90
aVone is in Livingston, Louisiana,
p91
aVin the middle of a beautiful forest,
p92
aVand the other is in Hanford, Washington,
p93
aVin the middle of the desert.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe interferometers have lasers
p96
aVthat travel from the center through four kilometers in-vacuum,
p97
aVare reflected in mirrors and then they return.
p98
aVWe measure the difference in the distances
p99
aVbetween this arm and this arm.
p100
aVThese detectors are very, very, very sensitive;
p101
aVthey're the most precise instruments in the world.
p102
aVWhy did we make two?
p103
aVIt's because the signals that we want to measure come from space,
p104
aVbut the mirrors are moving all the time,
p105
aVso in order to distinguish the gravitational wave effects \u2014
p106
aVwhich are astrophysical effects and should show up on the two detectors \u2014
p107
aVwe can distinguish them from the local effects,
p108
aVwhich appear separately, either on one or the other.
p109
aa(lp110
VIn September of 2015,
p111
aVwe were finishing installing the second-generation technology
p112
aVin the detectors,
p113
aVand we still weren't at the optimal sensitivity that we wanted \u2014
p114
aVwe're still not, even now, two years later \u2014
p115
aVbut we wanted to gather data.
p116
aVWe didn't think we'd see anything,
p117
aVbut we were getting ready to start collecting a few months' worth of data.
p118
aVAnd then nature surprised us.
p119
aa(lp120
VOn September 14, 2015,
p121
aVwe saw, in both detectors,
p122
aVa gravitational wave.
p123
aVIn both detectors, we saw a signal
p124
aVwith cycles that increased in amplitude and frequency
p125
aVand then go back down.
p126
aVAnd they were the same in both detectors.
p127
aVThey were gravitational waves.
p128
aVAnd not only that \u2014 in decoding this type of wave,
p129
aVwe were able to deduce that they came from black holes
p130
aVfusing together to make one,
p131
aVmore than a billion years ago.
p132
aVAnd that was \u2014
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
Vthat was fantastic.
p137
aa(lp138
VAt first, we couldn't believe it.
p139
aVWe didn't imagine this would happen until much later;
p140
aVit was a surprise for all of us.
p141
aVIt took us months to convince ourselves that it was true,
p142
aVbecause we didn't want to leave any room for error.
p143
aVBut it was true, and to clear up any doubt
p144
aVthat the detectors really could measure these things,
p145
aVin December of that same year,
p146
aVwe measured another gravitational wave,
p147
aVsmaller than the first one.
p148
aVThe first gravitational wave produced a difference in the distance
p149
aVof four-thousandths of a proton
p150
aVover four kilometers.
p151
aVYes, the second detection was smaller,
p152
aVbut still very convincing by our standards.
p153
aVDespite the fact that these are space-time waves and not sound waves,
p154
aVwe like to put them into loudspeakers and listen to them.
p155
aVWe call this "the music of the universe."
p156
aVI'd like you to listen to the first two notes of that music.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Chirping sound)
p159
aa(lp160
V(Chirping sound)
p161
aVThe second, shorter sound was the last fraction of a second
p162
aVof the two black holes which,
p163
aVin that fraction of a second, emitted vast amounts of energy \u2014
p164
aVso much energy, it was like three Suns converting into energy,
p165
aVfollowing that famous formula,
p166
aVE = mc2.
p167
aVRemember that one?
p168
aVWe love this music so much we actually dance to it.
p169
aVI'm going to have you listen again.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Chirping sound)
p172
aa(lp173
V(Chirping sound)
p174
aVIt's the music of the universe!
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VPeople frequently ask me now:
p179
aV"What can gravitational waves be used for?
p180
aVAnd now that you've discovered them, what else is there left to do?"
p181
aVWhat can gravitational waves be used for?
p182
aa(lp183
VWhen they asked Borges, "What is the purpose of poetry?"
p184
aVhe, in turn, answered,
p185
aV"What's the purpose of dawn?
p186
aVWhat's the purpose of caresses?
p187
aVWhat's the purpose of the smell of coffee?"
p188
aVHe answered,
p189
aV"The purpose of poetry is pleasure; it's for emotion, it's for living."
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd understanding the universe,
p192
aVthis human curiosity for knowing how everything works,
p193
aVis similar.
p194
aVSince time immemorial, humanity \u2014 all of us, everyone, as kids \u2014
p195
aVwhen we look up at the sky for the first time and see the stars,
p196
aVwe wonder,
p197
aV"What are stars?"
p198
aVThat curiosity is what makes us human.
p199
aVAnd that's what we do with science.
p200
aa(lp201
VWe like to say that gravitational waves now have a purpose,
p202
aVbecause we're opening up a new way to explore the universe.
p203
aVUntil now, we were able to see the light of the stars
p204
aVvia electromagnetic waves.
p205
aVNow we can listen to the sound of the universe,
p206
aVeven of things that don't emit light, like gravitational waves.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Applause)
p213
aa(lp214
VBut are they useful?
p215
aVCan't we derive any technology from gravitational waves?
p216
aa(lp217
VYes, probably.
p218
aVBut it will probably take a lot of time.
p219
aVWe've developed the technology to detect them,
p220
aVbut in terms of the waves themselves,
p221
aVmaybe we'll discover 100 years from now that they are useful.
p222
aVBut it takes a lot of time to derive technology from science,
p223
aVand that's not why we do it.
p224
aVAll technology is derived from science,
p225
aVbut we practice science for the enjoyment.
p226
aVWhat's left to do?
p227
aVA lot.
p228
aVA lot; this is only the beginning.
p229
aa(lp230
VAs we make the detectors more and more sensitive \u2014
p231
aVand we have lots of work to do there \u2014
p232
aVnot only are we going to see more black holes
p233
aVand be able to catalog how many there are, where they are
p234
aVand how big they are,
p235
aVwe'll also be able to see other objects.
p236
aVWe'll see neutron stars fuse and turn into black holes.
p237
aVWe'll see a black holes being born.
p238
aVWe'll be able to see rotating stars in our galaxy
p239
aVproduce sinusoidal waves.
p240
aVWe'll be able to see explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.
p241
aVWe'll be seeing a whole spectrum of new sources.
p242
aa(lp243
VWe like to say
p244
aVthat we've added a new sense to the human body:
p245
aVnow, in addition to seeing,
p246
aVwe're able to hear.
p247
aVThis is a revolution in astronomy,
p248
aVlike when Galileo invented the telescope.
p249
aVIt's like when they added sound to silent movies.
p250
aVThis is just the beginning.
p251
aVWe like to think
p252
aVthat the road to science is very long \u2014 very fun, but very long \u2014
p253
aVand that we, this large, international community of scientists,
p254
aVworking from many countries, together as a team,
p255
aVare helping to build that road;
p256
aVthat we're shedding light \u2014 sometimes encountering detours \u2014
p257
aVand building, perhaps,
p258
aVa highway to the universe.
