VLast January, my company, Fark.com, was sued
p4
aValong with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,
p5
aVAOL, TechCrunch and others
p6
aVby a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.
p7
aVGooseberry owned a patent
p8
aVfor the creation and distribution
p9
aVof news releases via email.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVNow it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,
p12
aVbut it does happen all the time.
p13
aa(lp14
VTake something already being done
p15
aVand patent it for an emerging technology \u2014
p16
aVlike phone calls on the internet
p17
aVor video listings for TV shows
p18
aVor radio but for cellphones,
p19
aVand so on.
p20
aVThe problem with these patents
p21
aVis that the mechanisms are obscure
p22
aVand the patent system is dysfunctional,
p23
aVand as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.
p24
aVAnd because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,
p25
aVno one knows what the terms were.
p26
aVAnd as a result, the patent troll can claim
p27
aVthat they won the case.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,
p30
aVthis patent on emailing news releases
p31
aVhad sort of a fatal flaw
p32
aVas it pertained to myself,
p33
aVand that was that in the mainstream media world
p34
aVthere is only one definition for news release,
p35
aVand it turns out that is press release \u2014
p36
aVas in P.R.
p37
aVNow my company, Fark,
p38
aVdeals with news, ostensibly,
p39
aVand as a result
p40
aVwe were not in violation of this patent.
p41
aVSo case closed, right?
p42
aVWrong.
p43
aa(lp44
VOne of the major problems with patent law is that,
p45
aVin the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,
p46
aVthe burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent
p47
aVis actually on the defendant,
p48
aVwhich means you have to prove
p49
aVthat you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.
p50
aVAnd this can take quite a while.
p51
aVYou need to know that the average patent troll defense
p52
aVcosts two million dollars
p53
aVand takes 18 months when you win.
p54
aVThat is your best case outcome
p55
aVwhen you get sued by a patent troll.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies
p58
aVin order to defend against this lawsuit,
p59
aVbut one-by-one they settled out of the case,
p60
aVeven though \u2014 and this is important \u2014
p61
aVnone of these companies
p62
aVinfringed on this patent \u2014 not a one of them.
p63
aVAnd they started settling out.
p64
aVThe reason they settled out
p65
aVis because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit \u2014
p66
aVclearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,
p67
aVand much worse if you actually lose.
p68
aVIt would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,
p69
aVespecially a small eight-man shop like my company.
p70
aa(lp71
VSix months into the lawsuit,
p72
aVwe finally reached the discovery phase.
p73
aVAnd in discovery phase,
p74
aVwe asked the patent troll to please provide
p75
aVscreenshots of Fark
p76
aVwhere the infringement of their patent
p77
aVwas actually occurring.
p78
aVNow perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,
p79
aVbut suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.
p80
aVTheir attorney:
p81
aV"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."
p82
aVNever mind the fact
p83
aVthat the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.
p84
aVwith no employees.
p85
aV"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.
p86
aVSo would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"
p87
aVMy response:
p88
aV"How about nothing?!"
p89
aV(Applause)
p90
aVWe didn't have high hopes for that outcome.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVBut they settled.
p93
aVNo counter offer.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, as mentioned before,
p96
aVone of the reasons I can talk to you about this
p97
aVis because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.
p98
aVNow how did that happen?
p99
aVWell during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.
p100
aVMy attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."
p101
aVIt came back signed.
p102
aVNow why? You can call them.
p103
aVThey're not under NDA either.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.
p106
aVFirst of all, if you can,
p107
aVdon't fight the patent, fight the infringement.
p108
aVPatents are very difficult to overturn.
p109
aVInfringement is a lot easier to disprove.
p110
aVSecondly, make it clear from the beginning
p111
aVthat either you have no money at all
p112
aVor that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll
p113
aVthan actually giving them the money.
p114
aVNow the reason this works
p115
aVis because patent trolls
p116
aVare paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.
p117
aVIf it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,
p118
aVthey become less interested in pursuing the case.
p119
aa(lp120
VFinally, make sure that you can tell them
p121
aVthat you will make this process
p122
aVas annoying and as painful
p123
aVand as difficult as possible for them.
p124
aVNow this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people
p125
aVto get their way.
p126
aVIt turns out, because they're paid on contingency,
p127
aVit works really, really well in reverse.
p128
aVDon't forget that.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what does all this mean?
p131
aVWell to sum up,
p132
aVit boils down to one thing:
p133
aVDon't negotiate with terrorists.
p134
aV(Applause)
p135
aVPatent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy
p136
aVthan any domestic or foreign
p137
aVterrorist organization in history
p138
aVevery year.
p139
aVAnd what do they do with that money?
p140
aVThey plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow this is the point in the Talk
p143
aVwhere I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.
p144
aVAnd the problem with that
p145
aVis that there are two very large industry groups
p146
aVthat have different outcomes in mind
p147
aVfor the patent system.
p148
aVThe health care industry
p149
aVwould like stronger protections for inventors.
p150
aVThe hi-tech industry
p151
aVwould like stronger protections for producers.
p152
aVAnd these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.
p153
aVAnd as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo unfortunately I'm not smart enough
p156
aVto have a solution for the patent troll problem.
p157
aVHowever, I did have this idea,
p158
aVand it was kind of good.
p159
aVAnd I thought, "I should patent this."
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVBehold, patent infringement via mobile device \u2014
p162
aVdefined as a computer which is not stationary.
p163
aVMy solution: award me this patent
p164
aVand I will troll them out of existence.
p165
aa(lp166
VThank you.
