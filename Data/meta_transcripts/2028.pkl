VToday,
p4
aVa baffled lady observed
p5
aVthe shell where my soul dwells
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd announced that I'm
p8
aV"articulate"
p9
aa(lp10
VWhich means that when it comes
p11
aVto enunciation and diction
p12
aa(lp13
VI don't even think of it
p14
aa(lp15
V\u2018Cause I\u2019m "articulate"
p16
aa(lp17
VSo when my professor asks a question
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd my answer is tainted with a connotation
p20
aVof urbanized suggestion
p21
aa(lp22
VThere\u2019s no misdirected intention
p23
aa(lp24
VPay attention
p25
aa(lp26
V\u2018Cause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p27
aa(lp28
VSo when my father asks, \u201cWha\u2019 kinda ting is dis?\u201d
p29
aa(lp30
VMy \u201carticulate\u201d answer never goes amiss
p31
aa(lp32
VI say \u201cfather, this is the impending problem at hand\u201d
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd when I\u2019m on the block
p35
aVI switch it up just because I can
p36
aa(lp37
VSo when my boy says, \u201cWhat\u2019s good with you son?\u201d
p38
aa(lp39
VI just say, \u201cI jus\u2019 fall out wit dem people but I done!\u201d
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd sometimes in class
p42
aa(lp43
VI might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask
p44
aa(lp45
V\u201cYo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples\u201d
p46
aa(lp47
VYes, I have decided to treat
p48
aVall three of my languages as equals
p49
aa(lp50
VBecause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p51
aa(lp52
VBut who controls articulation?
p53
aa(lp54
VBecause the English language is a multifaceted oration
p55
aa(lp56
VSubject to indefinite transformation
p57
aa(lp58
VNow you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English
p59
aa(lp60
VBut I\u2019m here to tell you that even \u201carticulate\u201d Americans
p61
aVsound foolish to the British
p62
aa(lp63
VSo when my Professor comes on the block and says, \u201cHello\u201d
p64
aa(lp65
VI stop him and say \u201cNoooo \u2026
p66
aa(lp67
VYou\u2019re being inarticulate \u2026
p68
aVthe proper way is to say \u2018what\u2019s good\u2019\u201d
p69
aa(lp70
VNow you may think that\u2019s too hood, that\u2019s not cool
p71
aa(lp72
VBut I\u2019m here to tell you that even our language has rules
p73
aa(lp74
VSo when Mommy mocks me and says
p75
aV\u201cya\u2019ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store\u201d
p76
aa(lp77
VI say \u201cMommy, no, that sentence is not following the law
p78
aa(lp79
VNever does the word "madd" go  before a present participle
p80
aa(lp81
VThat\u2019s simply the principle of this English\u201d
p82
aa(lp83
VIf I had the vocal capacity I would
p84
aVsing this from every mountaintop,
p85
aa(lp86
VFrom every suburbia, and every hood
p87
aa(lp88
V\u2018Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis
p89
aa(lp90
VOf this world saying \u201cit is good"
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I may not always come before you
p93
aVwith excellency of speech
p94
aa(lp95
VBut do not judge me by my language and assume
p96
aa(lp97
VThat I\u2019m too ignorant to teach
p98
aa(lp99
V\u2018Cause I speak three tongues
p100
aa(lp101
VOne for each:
p102
aa(lp103
VHome, school and friends
p104
aa(lp105
VI\u2019m a tri-lingual orator
p106
aa(lp107
VSometimes I\u2019m consistent with my language now
p108
aa(lp109
VThen switch it up so I don\u2019t bore later
p110
aa(lp111
VSometimes I fight back two tongues
p112
aa(lp113
VWhile I use the other one in the classroom
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd when I mistakenly mix them up
p116
aa(lp117
VI feel crazy like \u2026 I\u2019m cooking in the bathroom
p118
aa(lp119
VI know that I had to borrow your language
p120
aVbecause mines was stolen
p121
aa(lp122
VBut you can\u2019t expect me to speak your history wholly
p123
aVwhile mines is broken
p124
aa(lp125
VThese words are spoken
p126
aa(lp127
VBy someone who is simply fed up with
p128
aVthe Eurocentric ideals of this season
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd the reason I speak a composite version of your language
p131
aa(lp132
VIs because mines was raped away along with my history
p133
aa(lp134
VI speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us
p135
aa(lp136
VThat our current state is not a mystery
p137
aa(lp138
VI\u2019m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad
p139
aa(lp140
VSo unless you\u2019ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad
p141
aa(lp142
VI\u2019m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity
p143
aa(lp144
VSo don\u2019t call it good unless your hair is known
p145
aVfor donating to charity
p146
aa(lp147
VAs much as has been raped away from our people
p148
aa(lp149
VHow can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language
p150
aa(lp151
VAs anything less than equal
p152
aa(lp153
VLet there be no confusion
p154
aa(lp155
VLet there be no hesitation
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is not a promotion of ignorance
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is a linguistic celebration
p160
aa(lp161
VThat\u2019s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application
p162
aa(lp163
VI can help to diversify your consumer market
p164
aVis all I wanted them to know
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd when they call me for the interview
p167
aVI\u2019ll be more than happy to show that
p168
aa(lp169
VI can say:
p170
aa(lp171
V\u201cWhat\u2019s good\u201d
p172
aa(lp173
V\u201cWhatagwan\u201d
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd of course \u2026\u201cHello\u201d
p176
aa(lp177
VBecause I\u2019m \u201carticulate\u201d
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you.
