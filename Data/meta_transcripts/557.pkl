VI was thinking about my place in the universe,
p4
aVand about my first thought about what infinity might mean,
p5
aVwhen I was a child.
p6
aVAnd I thought that if time could reach
p7
aVforwards and backwards infinitely,
p8
aVdoesn't that mean that
p9
aVevery point in time is really infinitely small,
p10
aVand therefore somewhat meaningless.
p11
aVSo we don't really have a place in the universe,
p12
aVas far as on a time line.
p13
aVBut nothing else does either.
p14
aVTherefore every moment really is the most important moment
p15
aVthat's ever happened, including this moment right now.
p16
aVAnd so therefore this music you're about to hear
p17
aVis maybe the most important music
p18
aVyou'll ever hear in your life.

VFor those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,
p31
aVyou could please refrain from saying,
p32
aV"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVBecause it's like the stage is an optical illusion,
p35
aVfor some reason.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVSomewhat like the curving of the universe.

VI don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,
