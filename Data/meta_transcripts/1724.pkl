VLet's face it:
p4
aVDriving is dangerous.
p5
aVIt's one of the things that we don't like to think about,
p6
aVbut the fact that religious icons and good luck charms
p7
aVshow up on dashboards around the world
p8
aVbetrays the fact that we know this to be true.
p9
aVCar accidents are the leading cause of death
p10
aVin people ages 16 to 19 in the United States \u2014
p11
aVleading cause of death \u2014
p12
aVand 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do
p13
aVwith drugs or alcohol.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo what happens?
p16
aVNo one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.
p17
aVI was a young driver out on the highway,
p18
aVand the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.
p19
aVI'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,
p20
aVI'll slow down too."
p21
aVI step on the brake.
p22
aVBut no, this guy isn't slowing down.
p23
aVThis guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
p24
aVIt was just going 65 \u2014 to zero?
p25
aVI slammed on the brakes.
p26
aVI felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,
p27
aVand it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,
p28
aVand the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,
p29
aVand fortunately, no one was hurt.
p30
aVBut I had no idea that car was stopping,
p31
aVand I think we can do a lot better than that.
p32
aVI think we can transform the driving experience
p33
aVby letting our cars talk to each other.
p34
aa(lp35
VI just want you to think a little bit
p36
aVabout what the experience of driving is like now.
p37
aVGet into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.
p38
aVYou can't really directly sense the world around you.
p39
aVYou're in this extended body.
p40
aVYou're tasked with navigating it down
p41
aVpartially-seen roadways,
p42
aVin and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.
p43
aVOkay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.
p44
aVOkay, so that's all you have,
p45
aVeyes that weren't really designed for this task,
p46
aVbut then people ask you to do things like,
p47
aVyou want to make a lane change,
p48
aVwhat's the first thing they ask you do?
p49
aVTake your eyes off the road. That's right.
p50
aVStop looking where you're going, turn,
p51
aVcheck your blind spot,
p52
aVand drive down the road without looking where you're going.
p53
aVYou and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.
p54
aVWhy do we do this? Because we have to,
p55
aVwe have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?
p56
aVWhat's more important?
p57
aVAnd usually we do a fantastic job
p58
aVpicking and choosing what we attend to on the road.
p59
aVBut occasionally we miss something.
p60
aVOccasionally we sense something wrong or too late.
p61
aVIn countless accidents, the driver says,
p62
aV"I didn't see it coming."
p63
aVAnd I believe that. I believe that.
p64
aVWe can only watch so much.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut the technology exists now that can help us improve that.
p67
aVIn the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,
p68
aVwe will be able to see not just three cars ahead
p69
aVand three cars behind, to the right and left,
p70
aVall at the same time, bird's eye view,
p71
aVwe will actually be able to see into those cars.
p72
aVWe will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,
p73
aVto see how fast that guy's going or stopping.
p74
aVIf that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd with computation and algorithms and predictive models,
p77
aVwe will be able to see the future.
p78
aVYou may think that's impossible.
p79
aVHow can you predict the future? That's really hard.
p80
aVActually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.
p81
aVCars are three-dimensional objects
p82
aVthat have a fixed position and velocity.
p83
aVThey travel down roads.
p84
aVOften they travel on pre-published routes.
p85
aVIt's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions
p86
aVabout where a car's going to be in the near future.
p87
aVEven if, when you're in your car
p88
aVand some motorcyclist comes \u2014 bshoom! \u2014
p89
aV85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting \u2014
p90
aVI know you've had this experience \u2014
p91
aVthat guy didn't "just come out of nowhere."
p92
aVThat guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVRight? I mean, somebody's seen him.
p95
aVTen, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,
p96
aVand as soon as one car sees that guy
p97
aVand puts him on the map, he's on the map \u2014
p98
aVposition, velocity,
p99
aVgood estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.
p100
aVYou'll know, because your car will know, because
p101
aVthat other car will have whispered something in his ear,
p102
aVlike, "By the way, five minutes,
p103
aVmotorcyclist, watch out."
p104
aVYou can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.
p105
aVI mean, they're Newtonian objects.
p106
aVThat's very nice about them.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo how do we get there?
p109
aVWe can start with something as simple
p110
aVas sharing our position data between cars,
p111
aVjust sharing GPS.
p112
aVIf I have a GPS and a camera in my car,
p113
aVI have a pretty precise idea of where I am
p114
aVand how fast I'm going.
p115
aVWith computer vision, I can estimate where
p116
aVthe cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.
p117
aVAnd same with the other cars.
p118
aVThey can have a precise idea of where they are,
p119
aVand sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.
p120
aVWhat happens if two cars share that data,
p121
aVif they talk to each other?
p122
aVI can tell you exactly what happens.
p123
aVBoth models improve.
p124
aVEverybody wins.
p125
aVProfessor Bob Wang and his team
p126
aVhave done computer simulations of what happens
p127
aVwhen fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,
p128
aVwhen cars just share GPS data,
p129
aVand we've moved this research out of the computer simulation
p130
aVand into robot test beds that have the actual sensors
p131
aVthat are in cars now on these robots:
p132
aVstereo cameras, GPS,
p133
aVand the two-dimensional laser range finders
p134
aVthat are common in backup systems.
p135
aVWe also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,
p136
aVand the robots talk to each other.
p137
aVWhen these robots come at each other,
p138
aVthey track each other's position precisely,
p139
aVand they can avoid each other.
p140
aa(lp141
VWe're now adding more and more robots into the mix,
p142
aVand we encountered some problems.
p143
aVOne of the problems, when you get too much chatter,
p144
aVit's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,
p145
aVand that's where the predictive model helps you.
p146
aVIf your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,
p147
aVyou don't pay as much attention to those packets.
p148
aVYou prioritize the one guy
p149
aVwho seems to be going a little off course.
p150
aVThat guy could be a problem.
p151
aVAnd you can predict the new trajectory.
p152
aVSo you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.
p153
aVAnd you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd we wanted to do \u2014 how can we best alert everyone?
p156
aVHow can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?"
p157
aVWell, it depends on two things:
p158
aVone, the ability of the car,
p159
aVand second the ability of the driver.
p160
aVIf one guy has a really great car,
p161
aVbut they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,
p162
aVthey're not probably in the best position
p163
aVto react in an emergency.
p164
aVSo we started a separate line of research
p165
aVdoing driver state modeling.
p166
aVAnd now, using a series of three cameras,
p167
aVwe can detect if a driver is looking forward,
p168
aVlooking away, looking down, on the phone,
p169
aVor having a cup of coffee.
p170
aVWe can predict the accident
p171
aVand we can predict who, which cars,
p172
aVare in the best position to move out of the way
p173
aVto calculate the safest route for everyone.
p174
aVFundamentally, these technologies exist today.
p175
aa(lp176
VI think the biggest problem that we face
p177
aVis our own willingness to share our data.
p178
aVI think it's a very disconcerting notion,
p179
aVthis idea that our cars will be watching us,
p180
aVtalking about us to other cars,
p181
aVthat we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.
p182
aVBut I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,
p183
aVjust like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,
p184
aVI don't really know about you.
p185
aVIf I look at your license plate number,
p186
aVI don't really know who you are.
p187
aVI believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd I think it's going to be a great thing.
p192
aVI want you to consider for a moment
p193
aVif you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you
p194
aVto know that you're braking,
p195
aVthat you're coming to a dead stop.
p196
aVBy sharing our data willingly,
p197
aVwe can do what's best for everyone.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo let your car gossip about you.
p200
aVIt's going to make the roads a lot safer.
p201
aa(lp202
VThank you.
