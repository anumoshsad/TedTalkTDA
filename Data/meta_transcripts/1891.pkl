VI have a question:
p4
aVWho here remembers when they first realized
p5
aVthey were going to die?
p6
aa(lp7
VI do. I was a young boy,
p8
aVand my grandfather had just died,
p9
aVand I remember a few days later lying in bed at night
p10
aVtrying to make sense of what had happened.
p11
aVWhat did it mean that he was dead?
p12
aVWhere had he gone?
p13
aVIt was like a hole in reality had opened up
p14
aVand swallowed him.
p15
aVBut then the really shocking question occurred to me:
p16
aVIf he could die, could it happen to me too?
p17
aVCould that hole in reality open up and swallow me?
p18
aVWould it open up beneath my bed
p19
aVand swallow me as I slept?
p20
aVWell, at some point, all children become aware of death.
p21
aVIt can happen in different ways, of course,
p22
aVand usually comes in stages.
p23
aVOur idea of death develops as we grow older.
p24
aVAnd if you reach back into the dark corners
p25
aVof your memory,
p26
aVyou might remember something like what I felt
p27
aVwhen my grandfather died and when I realized
p28
aVit could happen to me too,
p29
aVthat sense that behind all of this
p30
aVthe void is waiting.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd this development in childhood
p33
aVreflects the development of our species.
p34
aVJust as there was a point in your development
p35
aVas a child when your sense of self and of time
p36
aVbecame sophisticated enough
p37
aVfor you to realize you were mortal,
p38
aVso at some point in the evolution of our species,
p39
aVsome early human's sense of self and of time
p40
aVbecame sophisticated enough
p41
aVfor them to become the first human to realize,
p42
aV"I'm going to die."
p43
aVThis is, if you like, our curse.
p44
aVIt's the price we pay for being so damn clever.
p45
aVWe have to live in the knowledge
p46
aVthat the worst thing that can possibly happen
p47
aVone day surely will,
p48
aVthe end of all our projects,
p49
aVour hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.
p50
aVWe each live in the shadow of a personal
p51
aVapocalypse.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd that's frightening. It's terrifying.
p54
aVAnd so we look for a way out.
p55
aVAnd in my case, as I was about five years old,
p56
aVthis meant asking my mum.
p57
aVNow when I first started asking
p58
aVwhat happens when we die,
p59
aVthe grown-ups around me at the time
p60
aVanswered with a typical English mix of awkwardness
p61
aVand half-hearted Christianity,
p62
aVand the phrase I heard most often
p63
aVwas that granddad was now
p64
aV"up there looking down on us,"
p65
aVand if I should die too, which wouldn't happen of course,
p66
aVthen I too would go up there,
p67
aVwhich made death sound a lot like
p68
aVan existential elevator.
p69
aVNow this didn't sound very plausible.
p70
aVI used to watch a children's news program at the time,
p71
aVand this was the era of space exploration.
p72
aVThere were always rockets going up into the sky,
p73
aVup into space, going up there.
p74
aVBut none of the astronauts when they came back
p75
aVever mentioned having met my granddad
p76
aVor any other dead people.
p77
aVBut I was scared,
p78
aVand the idea of taking the existential elevator
p79
aVto see my granddad
p80
aVsounded a lot better than being swallowed
p81
aVby the void while I slept.
p82
aVAnd so I believed it anyway,
p83
aVeven though it didn't make much sense.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd this thought process that I went through
p86
aVas a child, and have been through many times since,
p87
aVincluding as a grown-up,
p88
aVis a product of what psychologists call
p89
aVa bias.
p90
aVNow a bias is a way in which we systematically
p91
aVget things wrong,
p92
aVways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,
p93
aVdistort reality, or see what we want to see,
p94
aVand the bias I'm talking about
p95
aVworks like this:
p96
aVConfront someone with the fact
p97
aVthat they are going to die
p98
aVand they will believe just about any story
p99
aVthat tells them it isn't true
p100
aVand they can, instead, live forever,
p101
aVeven if it means taking the existential elevator.
p102
aVNow we can see this as the biggest bias of all.
p103
aVIt has been demonstrated in over 400
p104
aVempirical studies.
p105
aVNow these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.
p106
aVThey work like this.
p107
aVYou take two groups of people
p108
aVwho are similar in all relevant respects,
p109
aVand you remind one group that they're going to die
p110
aVbut not the other, then you compare their behavior.
p111
aVSo you're observing how it biases behavior
p112
aVwhen people become aware of their mortality.
p113
aVAnd every time, you get the same result:
p114
aVPeople who are made aware of their mortality
p115
aVare more willing to believe stories
p116
aVthat tell them they can escape death
p117
aVand live forever.
p118
aVSo here's an example: One recent study
p119
aVtook two groups of agnostics,
p120
aVthat is people who are undecided
p121
aVin their religious beliefs.
p122
aVNow, one group was asked to think about being dead.
p123
aVThe other group was asked to think about
p124
aVbeing lonely.
p125
aVThey were then asked again about their religious beliefs.
p126
aVThose who had been asked to think about being dead
p127
aVwere afterwards twice as likely to express faith
p128
aVin God and Jesus.
p129
aVTwice as likely.
p130
aVEven though the before they were all equally agnostic.
p131
aVBut put the fear of death in them,
p132
aVand they run to Jesus.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, this shows that reminding people of death
p135
aVbiases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,
p136
aVand it works not just for religion,
p137
aVbut for any kind of belief system
p138
aVthat promises immortality in some form,
p139
aVwhether it's becoming famous
p140
aVor having children
p141
aVor even nationalism,
p142
aVwhich promises you can live on as part of a greater whole.
p143
aVThis is a bias that has shaped
p144
aVthe course of human history.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, the theory behind this bias
p147
aVin the over 400 studies
p148
aVis called terror management theory,
p149
aVand the idea is simple. It's just this.
p150
aVWe develop our worldviews,
p151
aVthat is, the stories we tell ourselves
p152
aVabout the world and our place in it,
p153
aVin order to help us manage
p154
aVthe terror of death.
p155
aVAnd these immortality stories
p156
aVhave thousands of different manifestations,
p157
aVbut I believe that behind the apparent diversity
p158
aVthere are actually just four basic forms
p159
aVthat these immortality stories can take.
p160
aVAnd we can see them repeating themselves
p161
aVthroughout history, just with slight variations
p162
aVto reflect the vocabulary of the day.
p163
aVNow I'm going to briefly introduce these four
p164
aVbasic forms of immortality story,
p165
aVand I want to try to give you some sense
p166
aVof the way in which they're retold by each culture
p167
aVor generation
p168
aVusing the vocabulary of their day.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, the first story is the simplest.
p171
aVWe want to avoid death,
p172
aVand the dream of doing that in this body
p173
aVin this world forever
p174
aVis the first and simplest kind of immortality story,
p175
aVand it might at first sound implausible,
p176
aVbut actually, almost every culture in human history
p177
aVhas had some myth or legend
p178
aVof an elixir of life or a fountain of youth
p179
aVor something that promises to keep us going
p180
aVforever.
p181
aVAncient Egypt had such myths,
p182
aVancient Babylon, ancient India.
p183
aVThroughout European history, we find them in the work of the alchemists,
p184
aVand of course we still believe this today,
p185
aVonly we tell this story using the vocabulary
p186
aVof science.
p187
aVSo 100 years ago,
p188
aVhormones had just been discovered,
p189
aVand people hoped that hormone treatments
p190
aVwere going to cure aging and disease,
p191
aVand now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,
p192
aVgenetic engineering, and nanotechnology.
p193
aVBut the idea that science can cure death
p194
aVis just one more chapter in the story
p195
aVof the magical elixir,
p196
aVa story that is as old as civilization.
p197
aVBut betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir
p198
aVand staying alive forever
p199
aVis a risky strategy.
p200
aVWhen we look back through history
p201
aVat all those who have sought an elixir in the past,
p202
aVthe one thing they now have in common
p203
aVis that they're all dead.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we need a backup plan, and exactly this kind of plan B
p206
aVis what the second kind of immortality story offers,
p207
aVand that's resurrection.
p208
aVAnd it stays with the idea that I am this body,
p209
aVI am this physical organism.
p210
aVIt accepts that I'm going to have to die
p211
aVbut says, despite that,
p212
aVI can rise up and I can live again.
p213
aVIn other words, I can do what Jesus did.
p214
aVJesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],
p215
aVand then he rose up and lived again.
p216
aVAnd the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again
p217
aVis orthodox believe, not just for Christians
p218
aVbut also Jews and Muslims.
p219
aVBut our desire to believe this story
p220
aVis so deeply embedded
p221
aVthat we are reinventing it again
p222
aVfor the scientific age,
p223
aVfor example, with the idea of cryonics.
p224
aVThat's the idea that when you die,
p225
aVyou can have yourself frozen,
p226
aVand then, at some point when technology
p227
aVhas advanced enough,
p228
aVyou can be thawed out and repaired and revived
p229
aVand so resurrected.
p230
aVAnd so some people believe an omnipotent god
p231
aVwill resurrect them to live again,
p232
aVand other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut for others, the whole idea of resurrection,
p235
aVof climbing out of the grave,
p236
aVit's just too much like a bad zombie movie.
p237
aVThey find the body too messy, too unreliable
p238
aVto guarantee eternal life,
p239
aVand so they set their hopes on the third,
p240
aVmore spiritual immortality story,
p241
aVthe idea that we can leave our body behind
p242
aVand live on as a soul.
p243
aVNow, the majority of people on Earth
p244
aVbelieve they have a soul,
p245
aVand the idea is central to many religions.
p246
aVBut even though, in its current form,
p247
aVin its traditional form,
p248
aVthe idea of the soul is still hugely popular,
p249
aVnonetheless we are again
p250
aVreinventing it for the digital age,
p251
aVfor example with the idea
p252
aVthat you can leave your body behind
p253
aVby uploading your mind, your essence,
p254
aVthe real you, onto a computer,
p255
aVand so live on as an avatar in the ether.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut of course there are skeptics who say
p258
aVif we look at the evidence of science,
p259
aVparticularly neuroscience,
p260
aVit suggests that your mind,
p261
aVyour essence, the real you,
p262
aVis very much dependent on a particular part
p263
aVof your body, that is, your brain.
p264
aVAnd such skeptics can find comfort
p265
aVin the fourth kind of immortality story,
p266
aVand that is legacy,
p267
aVthe idea that you can live on
p268
aVthrough the echo you leave in the world,
p269
aVlike the great Greek warrior Achilles,
p270
aVwho sacrificed his life fighting at Troy
p271
aVso that he might win immortal fame.
p272
aVAnd the pursuit of fame is as widespread
p273
aVand popular now as it ever was,
p274
aVand in our digital age,
p275
aVit's even easier to achieve.
p276
aVYou don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles
p277
aVor a great king or hero.
p278
aVAll you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat. (Laughter)
p279
aVBut some people prefer to leave a more tangible,
p280
aVbiological legacy \u2014 children, for example.
p281
aVOr they like, they hope, to live on
p282
aVas part of some greater whole,
p283
aVa nation or a family or a tribe,
p284
aVtheir gene pool.
p285
aVBut again, there are skeptics
p286
aVwho doubt whether legacy
p287
aVreally is immortality.
p288
aVWoody Allen, for example, who said,
p289
aV"I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen.
p290
aVI want to live on in my apartment."
p291
aa(lp292
VSo those are the four
p293
aVbasic kinds of immortality stories,
p294
aVand I've tried to give just some sense
p295
aVof how they're retold by each generation
p296
aVwith just slight variations
p297
aVto fit the fashions of the day.
p298
aVAnd the fact that they recur in this way,
p299
aVin such a similar form but in such different belief systems,
p300
aVsuggests, I think,
p301
aVthat we should be skeptical of the truth
p302
aVof any particular version of these stories.
p303
aVThe fact that some people believe
p304
aVan omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again
p305
aVand others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it
p306
aVsuggests that neither are really believing this
p307
aVon the strength of the evidence.
p308
aVRather, we believe these stories
p309
aVbecause we are biased to believe them,
p310
aVand we are biased to believe them
p311
aVbecause we are so afraid of death.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo the question is,
p314
aVare we doomed to lead the one life we have
p315
aVin a way that is shaped by fear and denial,
p316
aVor can we overcome this bias?
p317
aVWell the Greek philosopher Epicurus
p318
aVthought we could.
p319
aVHe argued that the fear of death is natural,
p320
aVbut it is not rational.
p321
aV"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,
p322
aVbecause when we are here, death is not,
p323
aVand when death is here, we are gone."
p324
aVNow this is often quoted, but it's difficult
p325
aVto really grasp, to really internalize,
p326
aVbecause exactly this idea of being gone
p327
aVis so difficult to imagine.
p328
aVSo 2,000 years later, another philosopher,
p329
aVLudwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:
p330
aV"Death is not an event in life:
p331
aVWe do not live to experience death.
p332
aVAnd so," he added,
p333
aV"in this sense, life has no end."
p334
aa(lp335
VSo it was natural for me as a child
p336
aVto fear being swallowed by the void,
p337
aVbut it wasn't rational,
p338
aVbecause being swallowed by the void
p339
aVis not something that any of us
p340
aVwill ever live to experience.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, overcoming this bias is not easy because
p343
aVthe fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,
p344
aVyet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,
p345
aVand when we bring out into the open
p346
aVthe ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,
p347
aVthen we can at least start
p348
aVto try to minimize the influence it has
p349
aVon our lives.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow, I find it helps to see life
p352
aVas being like a book:
p353
aVJust as a book is bounded by its covers,
p354
aVby beginning and end,
p355
aVso our lives are bounded by birth and death,
p356
aVand even though a book is limited by beginning and end,
p357
aVit can encompass distant landscapes,
p358
aVexotic figures, fantastic adventures.
p359
aVAnd even though a book is limited by beginning and end,
p360
aVthe characters within it
p361
aVknow no horizons.
p362
aVThey only know the moments that make up their story,
p363
aVeven when the book is closed.
p364
aVAnd so the characters of a book
p365
aVare not afraid of reaching the last page.
p366
aVLong John Silver is not afraid of you
p367
aVfinishing your copy of "Treasure Island."
p368
aVAnd so it should be with us.
p369
aVImagine the book of your life,
p370
aVits covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death.
p371
aVYou can only know the moments in between,
p372
aVthe moments that make up your life.
p373
aVIt makes no sense for you to fear
p374
aVwhat is outside of those covers,
p375
aVwhether before your birth
p376
aVor after your death.
p377
aVAnd you needn't worry how long the book is,
p378
aVor whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
p379
aVThe only thing that matters
p380
aVis that you make it a good story.
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you.
