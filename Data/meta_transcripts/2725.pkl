VThis is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.
p6
aVThis person had three different profiles
p7
aVand 890 kids between 8 and 13 years old among her friends list.
p8
aVThese are excerpts of a chat with one of those kids.
p9
aVThis is an exact copy of the chat.
p10
aVIt's part of the case file.
p11
aVThis kid started sending private photos
p12
aVuntil his family realized what was going on.
p13
aVThe police report and subsequent investigation lead them to a house.
p14
aVThis was the girl's bedroom.
p15
aVNina Rodríguez was actually a 24-year-old man
p16
aVthat used to do this with lots of kids.
p17
aa(lp18
VMicaela Ortega was 12 years old
p19
aVwhen she went to meet her new Facebook friend,
p20
aValso 12.
p21
aV"Rochi de River," was her name.
p22
aVShe actually met Jonathan Luna, who was 26 years old.
p23
aVWhen they finally caught him,
p24
aVhe confessed that he killed the girl because she refused to have sex with him.
p25
aVHe had four Facebook profiles
p26
aVand 1,700 women on his contact list;
p27
aV90 percent of them were under 13 years old.
p28
aa(lp29
VThese are two different cases of "grooming":
p30
aVan adult contacts a kid through the internet,
p31
aVand through manipulation or lying, leads that kid into sexual territory \u2014
p32
aVfrom talking about sex
p33
aVto sharing private photos,
p34
aVrecording the kid using a webcam
p35
aVor arranging an in-person meeting.
p36
aVThis is grooming.
p37
aVThis is happening, and it's on the rise.
p38
aVThe question is: What are we going to do?
p39
aVBecause, in the meantime, kids are alone.
p40
aVThey finish dinner, go to their rooms,
p41
aVclose the door,
p42
aVget on their computer, their cell phones,
p43
aVand get into a bar,
p44
aVinto a club.
p45
aa(lp46
VThink for one second about what I've just said:
p47
aVthey're in a place full of strangers
p48
aVin an uninhibited environment.
p49
aVThe internet broke physical boundaries.
p50
aVWhen we're alone in our bedroom and we go online,
p51
aVwe're not really alone.
p52
aa(lp53
VThere are at least two reasons why we're not taking care of this,
p54
aVor at least not in the right way.
p55
aVFirst, we're sure that everything that happens online is "virtual."
p56
aVIn fact, we call it "the virtual world."
p57
aVIf you look it up in the dictionary,
p58
aVsomething virtual is something that seems to exist
p59
aVbut is not real.
p60
aVAnd we use that word to talk about the internet:
p61
aVsomething not real.
p62
aVAnd that's the problem with grooming.
p63
aVIt is real.
p64
aVDegenerate, perverted adults use the internet to abuse boys and girls
p65
aVand take advantage of, among other things,
p66
aVthe fact that the kids and their parents think that what happens online
p67
aVdoesn't actually happen.
p68
aa(lp69
VSeveral years ago, some colleagues and I founded an NGO
p70
aVcalled "Argentina Cibersegura,"
p71
aVdedicated to raising awareness about online safety.
p72
aVIn 2013, we attended meetings at the House of Legislature
p73
aVto discuss a law about grooming.
p74
aVI remember that a lot of people thought
p75
aVthat grooming was strictly a precursor
p76
aVto arranging an in-person meeting with a kid to have sex with them.
p77
aVBut they didn't think about what happened to the kids who were exposed
p78
aVby talking about sex with an adult without knowing it,
p79
aVor who shared intimate photos thinking only another kid would see them,
p80
aVor even worse,
p81
aVwho had exposed themselves using their web cam.
p82
aVNobody considered that rape.
p83
aVI'm sure lots of you find it odd to think one person can abuse another
p84
aVwithout physical contact.
p85
aVWe're programmed to think that way.
p86
aVI know, because I used to think that way.
p87
aVI was just an IT security guy
p88
aVuntil this happened to me.
p89
aa(lp90
VAt the end of 2011,
p91
aVin a little town in Buenos Aires Province,
p92
aVI heard about a case for the first time.
p93
aVAfter giving a talk,
p94
aVI met the parents of an 11-year-old girl who had been a victim of grooming.
p95
aVA man had manipulated her into masturbating in front of her web cam,
p96
aVand recorded it.
p97
aVAnd the video was on several websites.
p98
aVThat day, her parents asked us, in tears,
p99
aVto tell them the magic formula
p100
aVfor how to delete those videos from the internet.
p101
aVIt broke my heart and changed me forever
p102
aVto be their last disappointment, telling them it was too late:
p103
aVonce content is online,
p104
aVwe've already lost control.
p105
aa(lp106
VSince that day, I think about that girl
p107
aVwaking up in the morning, having breakfast with her family,
p108
aVwho had seen the video,
p109
aVand then walking to school, meeting people that had seen her naked,
p110
aVarriving to school, playing with her friends, who had also seen her.
p111
aVThat was her life.
p112
aVExposed.
p113
aVOf course, nobody raped her body.
p114
aVBut hadn't her sexuality been abused?
p115
aa(lp116
VWe clearly use different standards to measure physical and digital things.
p117
aVAnd we get angry at social networks
p118
aVbecause being angry with ourselves is more painful and more true.
p119
aVAnd this brings us to the second reason why
p120
aVwe aren't paying proper attention to this issue.
p121
aVWe're convinced that kids don't need our help,
p122
aVthat they "know everything" about technology.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhen I was a kid,
p125
aVat one point, my parents started letting me walk to school alone.
p126
aVAfter years of taking me by the hand and walking me to school,
p127
aVone day they sat me down,
p128
aVgave me the house keys
p129
aVand said, "Be very careful with these; don't give them to anyone,
p130
aVtake the route we showed you, be at home at the time we said,
p131
aVcross at the corner, and look both ways before you cross,
p132
aVand no matter what, don't talk to strangers."
p133
aVI knew everything about walking,
p134
aVand yet, there was a responsible adult there taking care of me.
p135
aVKnowing how to do something is one thing,
p136
aVknowing how to take care of yourself is another.
p137
aVImagine this situation:
p138
aVI'm 10 or 11 years old, I wake up in the morning,
p139
aVmy parents toss me the keys and say,
p140
aV"Seba, now you can walk to school alone."
p141
aVAnd when I come back late,
p142
aVthey say, "No, you need to be home at the time we said."
p143
aVAnd two weeks later,
p144
aVwhen it comes up, they say, "You know what?
p145
aVYou have to cross at the corner, and look both ways before crossing."
p146
aVAnd two years later, they say,
p147
aV"And also, don't talk to strangers."
p148
aVIt sounds absurd, right?
p149
aa(lp150
VWe have the same absurd behavior in relation to technology.
p151
aVWe give kids total access
p152
aVand we see if one day, sooner or later,
p153
aVthey learn how to take care of themselves.
p154
aVKnowing how to do something is one thing,
p155
aVknowing how to take care of yourself is another.
p156
aa(lp157
VAlong those same lines, when we talk to parents,
p158
aVthey often say they don't care about technology and social networks.
p159
aVI always rejoin that by asking if they care about their kids.
p160
aVAs adults, being interested or not in technology
p161
aVis the same as being interested or not in our kids.
p162
aVThe internet is part of their lives.
p163
aVTechnology forces us to rethink the relationship between adults and kids.
p164
aVEducation was always based on two main concepts:
p165
aVexperience and knowledge.
p166
aVHow do we teach our kids to be safe online when we don't have either?
p167
aa(lp168
VNowadays, we adults have to guide our children
p169
aVthrough what is often for us unfamiliar territory \u2014
p170
aVterritory much more inviting for them.
p171
aVIt's impossible to find an answer
p172
aVwithout doing new things \u2014 things that make us uncomfortable,
p173
aVthings we're not used to.
p174
aa(lp175
VA lot of you may think it's easy for me,
p176
aVbecause I'm relatively young.
p177
aVAnd it used to be that way.
p178
aVUsed to.
p179
aVUntil last year,
p180
aVwhen I felt the weight of my age on my shoulders
p181
aVthe first time I opened Snapchat.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VI didn't understand a thing!
p188
aVI found it unnecessary,
p189
aVuseless, hard to understand;
p190
aVit looked like a camera!
p191
aVIt didn't have menu options!
p192
aVIt was the first time I felt the gap
p193
aVthat sometimes exists between kids and adults.
p194
aVBut it was also an opportunity to do the right thing,
p195
aVto leave my comfort zone, to force myself.
p196
aVI never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,
p197
aVbut then I asked my teenage cousin to show me how to use it.
p198
aVI also asked why she used it.
p199
aVWhat was fun about it?
p200
aVWe had a really nice talk.
p201
aVShe showed me her Snapchat, she told me things,
p202
aVwe got closer, we laughed.
p203
aVToday, I use it.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VI don't know if I do it right,
p208
aVbut the most important thing is that I know it and I understand it.
p209
aVThe key was to overcome the initial shock
p210
aVand do something new.
p211
aVSomething new.
p212
aVToday, we have the chance to create new conversations.
p213
aVWhat's the last app you downloaded?
p214
aVWhich social network do you use to contact your friends?
p215
aVWhat kind of information do you share?
p216
aVHave you ever been approached by strangers?
p217
aVCould we have these conversations between kids and adults?
p218
aVWe have to force ourselves to do it. All of us.
p219
aVToday, lots of kids are listening to us.
p220
aVSometimes when we go to schools to give our talks,
p221
aVor through social networks,
p222
aVkids ask or tell us things
p223
aVthey haven't told their parents or their teachers.
p224
aVThey tell us \u2014 they don't even know us.
p225
aVThose kids need to know
p226
aVwhat the risks of being online are,
p227
aVhow to take care of themselves,
p228
aVbut also that, fundamentally, as with almost everything else,
p229
aVkids can learn this from any adult.
p230
aa(lp231
VOnline safety needs to be a conversation topic
p232
aVin every house and every classroom in the country.
p233
aVWe did a survey this year that showed that 15 percent of schools said
p234
aVthey knew of cases of grooming in their school.
p235
aVAnd this number is growing.
p236
aVTechnology changed every aspect of our life,
p237
aVincluding the risks we face
p238
aVand how we take care of ourselves.
p239
aa(lp240
VGrooming shows us this in the most painful way:
p241
aVby involving our kids.
p242
aVAre we going to do something to avoid this?
p243
aVThe solution starts with something as easy as:
p244
aVtalking about it.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you.
