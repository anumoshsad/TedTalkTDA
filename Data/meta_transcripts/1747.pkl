(lp3
VSo, when I was in art school,
p4
aVI developed a shake in my hand,
p5
aVand this was the straightest line I could draw.
p6
aVNow in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,
p7
aVlike mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,
p8
aVbut at the time this was really doomsday.
p9
aVThis was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe shake developed out of, really,
p12
aVa single-minded pursuit of pointillism,
p13
aVjust years of making tiny, tiny dots.
p14
aVAnd eventually these dots went from being perfectly round
p15
aVto looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.
p16
aVSo to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,
p17
aVand this progressively made the shake worse,
p18
aVso I'd hold the pen tighter still.
p19
aVAnd this became a vicious cycle that ended up
p20
aVcausing so much pain and joint issues,
p21
aVI had trouble holding anything.
p22
aVAnd after spending all my life wanting to do art,
p23
aVI left art school, and then I left art completely.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,
p26
aVand I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake
p27
aVand discovered I had permanent nerve damage.
p28
aVAnd he actually took one look at my squiggly line,
p29
aVand said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,
p32
aVand I just started letting my hand shake and shake.
p33
aVI was making all these scribble pictures.
p34
aVAnd even though it wasn't the kind of art
p35
aVthat I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.
p36
aVAnd more importantly, once I embraced the shake,
p37
aVI realized I could still make art.
p38
aVI just had to find a different approach
p39
aVto making the art that I wanted.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,
p42
aVseeing these little tiny dots come together
p43
aVto make this unified whole.
p44
aVSo I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images
p45
aVwhere the shake wouldn't affect the work,
p46
aVlike dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,
p47
aVor, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,
p48
aVcreating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.
p49
aVI discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,
p50
aVmy hand really wouldn't hurt,
p51
aVand after having gone from a single approach to art,
p52
aVI ended up having an approach to creativity
p53
aVthat completely changed my artistic horizons.
p54
aVThis was the first time I'd encountered this idea
p55
aVthat embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.
p56
aa(lp57
VAt the time, I was finishing up school,
p58
aVand I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.
p59
aVI had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like
p60
aVI could do so much more with the supplies
p61
aVI thought an artist was supposed to have.
p62
aVI actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.
p63
aVI was using these metal shears until I stole a pair
p64
aVfrom the office that I worked at.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,
p67
aVI got myself to the art store,
p68
aVand I just went nuts buying supplies.
p69
aVAnd then when I got home, I sat down
p70
aVand I set myself to task to really try to create something
p71
aVjust completely outside of the box.
p72
aVBut I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.
p73
aVThe same thing the next day, and then the next,
p74
aVquickly slipping into a creative slump.
p75
aVAnd I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.
p76
aVAnd it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able
p77
aVto support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut as I searched around in the darkness,
p80
aVI realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices
p81
aVthat I never had before.
p82
aVAnd it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.
p83
aVEmbrace the shake.
p84
aVAnd I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,
p85
aVI had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
p86
aVand get back into it.
p87
aa(lp88
VI wondered, could you become more creative, then,
p89
aVby looking for limitations?
p90
aVWhat if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?
p91
aVAt this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in \u2014
p92
aVwell, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks \u2014
p93
aVbut I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,
p94
aVso I decided to ask for 50.
p95
aVSurprisingly, they just handed them right over,
p96
aVand then with some pencils I already had,
p97
aVI made this project for only 80 cents.
p98
aVIt really became a moment of clarification for me
p99
aVthat we need to first be limited
p100
aVin order to become limitless.
p101
aa(lp102
VI took this approach of thinking inside the box
p103
aVto my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of
p104
aVpainting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?
p105
aVSo I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,
p106
aVone on top of another,
p107
aVwith each picture representing an influence in my life.
p108
aVOr what if, instead of painting with a brush,
p109
aVI could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)
p110
aVSo I'd dip my hands in paint,
p111
aVand I just attacked the canvas,
p112
aVand I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie
p113
aVand it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VOr, what if instead of relying on myself,
p118
aVI had to rely on other people
p119
aVto create the content for the art?
p120
aVSo for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.
p121
aVI slept on the floor and I ate takeout,
p122
aVand I asked people to call me and share a story with me
p123
aVabout a life-changing moment.
p124
aVTheir stories became the art
p125
aVas I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aVOr what if instead of making art to display,
p129
aVI had to destroy it?
p130
aVThis seemed like the ultimate limitation,
p131
aVbeing an artist without art.
p132
aVThis destruction idea turned into a yearlong project
p133
aVthat I called Goodbye Art,
p134
aVwhere each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.
p135
aVIn the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on
p136
aVforced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,
p137
aVmade with over 7,000 matches.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVThen I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.
p140
aVI looked for temporary materials,
p141
aVlike spitting out food \u2014
p142
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p143
aVsidewalk chalk
p144
aVand even frozen wine.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe last iteration of destruction
p147
aVwas to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.
p148
aVSo I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,
p149
aVthen repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,
p150
aVthen assembled the videos into the larger image.
p151
aVSo the end image was never visible as a physical whole.
p152
aVIt was destroyed before it ever existed.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn the course of this Goodbye Art series,
p155
aVI created 23 different pieces
p156
aVwith nothing left to physically display.
p157
aVWhat I thought would be the ultimate limitation
p158
aVactually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,
p159
aVas each time I created,
p160
aVthe destruction brought me back to a neutral place
p161
aVwhere I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.
p162
aVIt did not happen overnight.
p163
aVThere were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,
p164
aVor, even worse, after spending tons of time on them
p165
aVthe end image was kind of embarrassing.
p166
aVBut having committed to the process, I continued on,
p167
aa(lp168
Vand something really surprising came out of this.
p169
aVAs I destroyed each project,
p170
aVI was learning to let go,
p171
aVlet go of outcomes, let go of failures,
p172
aVand let go of imperfections.
p173
aVAnd in return, I found a process of creating art
p174
aVthat's perpetual and unencumbered by results.
p175
aVI found myself in a state of constant creation,
p176
aVthinking only of what's next
p177
aVand coming up with more ideas than ever.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhen I think back to my three years away from art,
p180
aVaway from my dream, just going through the motions,
p181
aVinstead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,
p182
aVI just quit, I gave up.
p183
aVAnd what if I didn't embrace the shake?
p184
aVBecause embracing the shake for me
p185
aVwasn't just about art and having art skills.
p186
aVIt turned out to be about life, and having life skills.
p187
aVBecause ultimately, most of what we do
p188
aVtakes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.
p189
aVLearning to be creative within the confines of our limitations
p190
aVis the best hope we have to transform ourselves
p191
aVand, collectively, transform our world.
p192
aa(lp193
VLooking at limitations as a source of creativity
p194
aVchanged the course of my life.
p195
aVNow, when I run into a barrier
p196
aVor I find myself creatively stumped,
p197
aVI sometimes still struggle,
p198
aVbut I continue to show up for the process
p199
aVand try to remind myself of the possibilities,
p200
aVlike using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,
p201
aVusing a pushpin to tattoo a banana,
p202
aVor painting a picture with hamburger grease.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VOne of my most recent endeavors
p207
aVis to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned
p208
aVinto something others can replicate.
p209
aa(lp210
VLimitations may be the most unlikely of places
p211
aVto harness creativity, but perhaps
p212
aVone of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,
p213
aVrethink categories and challenge accepted norms.
p214
aVAnd instead of telling each other to seize the day,
p215
aVmaybe we can remind ourselves every day
p216
aVto seize the limitation.
p217
