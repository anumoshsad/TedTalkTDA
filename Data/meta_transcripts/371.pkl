(lp3
VWhoa, dude.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VCheck out those killer equations. Sweet.
p8
aVActually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can
p9
aVto describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
p10
aVIt turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
p11
aVA coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
p12
aVEach coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps.
p13
aVThese polyps are continually budding and branching
p14
aVinto genetically identical neighbors.
p15
aVIf we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral,
p16
aVwe can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
p17
aVWe can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location
p18
aVcompared to his neighbors \u2014
p19
aVif it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high,
p22
aVhe would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
p23
aVThese corals can be kind of mean, you see,
p24
aVand I have surfing scars to prove that.
p25
aVBut this polyp would continue and tell us
p26
aVthat his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
p27
aVThat he was in all these other locations as well,
p28
aVbut experiencing them as separate individuals.
p29
aVFor a coral, branching into different copies
p30
aVis the most natural thing in the world.
p31
aa(lp32
VUnlike us, a hyperintelligent coral
p33
aVwould be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.
p34
aVThe mathematics of quantum mechanics
p35
aVvery accurately describes how our universe works.
p36
aVAnd it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities,
p37
aVjust like a coral.
p38
aVIt's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around,
p39
aVsince we only ever get to experience one possibility.
p40
aVThis quantum weirdness was first described
p41
aVby Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
p42
aVThe cat likes this version better.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VIn this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
p47
aVthat, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state
p48
aVin which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VIn the branch in which the sample radiates,
p53
aVit sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.
p54
aVBut in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
p55
aVThese realities are experienced separately by each individual.
p56
aVAs far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis seems weird to us,
p59
aVbecause each of us only experiences an individual existence,
p60
aVand we don't get to see other branches.
p61
aVIt's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here,
p62
aVare a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.
p63
aVThe mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us
p64
aVthis is how the world works at tiny scales.
p65
aVIt can be summed up in a single sentence:
p66
aVEverything that can happen, does.
p67
aVThat's quantum mechanics.
p68
aVBut this does not mean everything happens.
p69
aVThe rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't.
p70
aVWhat physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry
p71
aVand the interactions of elementary particles.
p72
aVAnd things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles,
p75
aVwhat they are and how this balance works.
p76
aVIn this machine, a beam of protons and antiprotons
p77
aVare accelerated to near the speed of light
p78
aVand brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
p79
aVThis energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles,
p80
aVwith detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
p81
aVThis enormous machine \u2014
p82
aVthe Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva \u2014
p83
aVhas a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating,
p84
aVdraws five times as much power as the city of Monterey.
p85
aVWe can't predict specifically
p86
aVwhat particles will be produced in any individual collision.
p87
aVQuantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.
p88
aVBut physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
p89
aVThese particles must have just as much mass and energy
p90
aVas is carried in by the proton and antiproton.
p91
aVAny particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced,
p92
aVand remain invisible to us.
p93
aVThis is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
p94
aVIt's going to push this energy limit seven times
p95
aVbeyond what's ever been done before,
p96
aVso we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut before talking about what we might see,
p99
aVlet me describe the particles we already know of.
p100
aVThere's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
p101
aVMost of us are familiar with electrons.
p102
aVA lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VBut the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino,
p107
aVwith no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
p108
aVIn contrast, the up and down quarks have very large masses,
p109
aVand combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms.
p110
aVAll of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties,
p111
aVand have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges.
p112
aVThese familiar particles
p113
aValso have less familiar second and third generations,
p114
aVwhich have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.
p115
aVThese matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
p116
aVThe electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter
p117
aVvia particles called photons.
p118
aVThere is also a very weak force
p119
aVcalled, rather unimaginatively, the weak force ...
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
Vthat interacts only with left-handed matter.
p124
aVThe strong force acts between quarks
p125
aVwhich carry a different kind of charge, called color charge,
p126
aVand come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
p127
aVYou can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names \u2014 they're his fault.
p128
aVFinally, there's the force of gravity,
p129
aVwhich interacts with matter via its mass and spin.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe most important thing to understand here
p132
aVis that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces.
p133
aVThese four different forces interact with matter
p134
aVaccording to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
p135
aVA particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists,
p136
aVis the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
p137
aVThe main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider
p138
aVis to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
p139
aVBut the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
p140
aVAnd I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility
p141
aVtowards the end of this talk.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, if we count up all these different particles
p144
aVusing their various spins and charges,
p145
aVthere are 226.
p146
aVThat's a lot of particles to keep track of.
p147
aVAnd it seems strange
p148
aVthat nature would have so many elementary particles.
p149
aVBut if we plot them out according to their charges,
p150
aVsome beautiful patterns emerge.
p151
aVThe most familiar charge is electric charge.
p152
aVElectrons have an electric charge,
p153
aVa negative one,
p154
aVand quarks have electric charges in thirds.
p155
aVSo when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton,
p156
aVit has a total electric charge of plus one.
p157
aVThese particles also have antiparticles, which have opposite charges.
p158
aVNow, it turns out the electric charge
p159
aVis actually a combination of two other charges:
p160
aVhypercharge and weak charge.
p161
aVIf we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge
p162
aVand plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space,
p163
aVthe electric charge is where these particles sit
p164
aValong the vertical direction.
p165
aVThe electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter
p166
aVaccording to their hypercharge and weak charge,
p167
aVwhich make this pattern.
p168
aVThis is called the unified electroweak model,
p169
aVand it was put together back in 1967.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge
p172
aVand not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
p173
aVThe Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass
p174
aVand breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
p175
aVIt makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass.
p176
aVSince this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram,
p177
aVthe photons of electromagnetism remain massless
p178
aVand interact with electric charge along the vertical direction
p179
aVin this charge space.
p180
aVSo the electromagnetic and weak forces
p181
aVare described by this pattern of particle charges
p182
aVin two-dimensional space.
p183
aVWe can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions
p184
aVand plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks
p185
aValong these directions.
p186
aVThe charges of all known particles
p187
aVcan be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space,
p188
aVand projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance
p191
aValong all four of these charge directions.
p192
aVIf a particle and an antiparticle collide,
p193
aVit creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero
p194
aVin all four charge directions.
p195
aVAt this point, anything can be created
p196
aVas long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
p197
aVFor example, this weak force particle and its antiparticle
p198
aVcan be created in a collision.
p199
aVIn further interactions, the charges must always balance.
p200
aVOne of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an antineutrino,
p201
aVand these three still add to zero total charge.
p202
aVNature always keeps a perfect balance.
p203
aVSo these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
p204
aVThey tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
p205
aVAnd we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions
p206
aVto get a better look at the strong interaction,
p207
aVwhich has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
p208
aVIn a strong interaction, a strong force particle,
p209
aVsuch as this one,
p210
aVinteracts with a colored quark, such as this green one,
p211
aVto give a quark with a different color charge \u2014 this red one.
p212
aVAnd strong interactions are happening millions of times
p213
aVeach second in every atom of our bodies,
p214
aVholding the atomic nuclei together.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut these four charges corresponding to three forces
p217
aVare not the end of the story.
p218
aVWe can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force.
p219
aVWhen we include these,
p220
aVeach matter particle has two different spin charges,
p221
aVspin-up and spin-down.
p222
aVSo they all split and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space.
p223
aVWe can rotate this pattern in six dimensions
p224
aVand see that it's quite pretty.
p225
aVRight now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge
p226
aVof how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles.
p227
aVThis is what we know for certain.
p228
aVSome of these particles are at the very limit
p229
aVof what we've been able to reach with experiments.
p230
aVFrom this pattern
p231
aVwe already know the particle physics of these tiny scales \u2014
p232
aVthe way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas
p235
aVabout things we don't know yet.
p236
aVWe want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone,
p237
aVand see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
p238
aVWe want to find all the particles and forces
p239
aVthat make a complete picture of our universe.
p240
aVAnd we want to use this picture to predict new particles
p241
aVthat we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo there's an old idea in particle physics
p244
aVthat this known pattern of charges,
p245
aVwhich is not very symmetric,
p246
aVcould emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken \u2014
p247
aVsimilar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern
p248
aVto give electromagnetism.
p249
aVIn order to do this, we need to introduce new forces
p250
aVwith new charge directions.
p251
aVWhen we introduce a new direction,
p252
aVwe get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction,
p253
aVand then we can rotate it in with the others.
p254
aVIf we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges
p255
aVin six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry
p256
aVof this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory
p259
aVintroduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
p260
aVWhen we look at this new unified pattern,
p261
aVwe can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
p262
aVThis is the way theories of unification work.
p263
aVA physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns
p264
aVthat include the established pattern as a subset.
p265
aVThe larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles
p266
aVthat have never been seen.
p267
aVThis unification model predicts the existence
p268
aVof these two new force particles,
p269
aVwhich should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions
p272
aVand consider an odd fact about the matter particles:
p273
aVthe second and third generations of matter
p274
aVhave exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space
p275
aVas the first generation.
p276
aVThese particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
p277
aVThey sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
p278
aVHowever, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space,
p279
aVthen we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
p280
aVThen we can spin these in eight dimensions
p281
aVand see what the whole pattern looks like.
p282
aVHere we can see the second and third generations of matter now,
p283
aVrelated to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
p284
aa(lp285
VThis particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions
p286
aVis actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
p287
aVIt's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
p288
aVThis Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
p289
aVEach point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry
p290
aVof this very complex and beautiful shape.
p291
aVOne small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe
p292
aVthe curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,
p293
aVexplaining gravity.
p294
aVTogether with quantum mechanics,
p295
aVthe geometry of this shape could describe everything
p296
aVabout how the universe works at the tiniest scales.
p297
aVThe pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space
p298
aVis exquisitely beautiful,
p299
aVand it summarizes thousands of possible interactions
p300
aVbetween these elementary particles,
p301
aVeach of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.
p302
aa(lp303
VAs we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns
p304
aVcontained in this one.
p305
aVAnd with a particular rotation,
p306
aVwe can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
p307
aVand see all the particles at once.
p308
aVIt's a very beautiful object,
p309
aVand as with any unification,
p310
aVwe can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern.
p311
aVThere are 20 gaps where new particles should be,
p312
aVtwo of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
p313
aVFrom their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles
p314
aVshould be scalar fields like the Higgs particle,
p315
aVbut have color charge and interact with the strong force.
p316
aVFilling in these new particles completes this pattern,
p317
aVgiving us the full E8.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
p320
aVIt's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics.
p321
aVIt's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty
p322
aVcould describe the truth of particle interactions
p323
aVat the smallest scales imaginable.
p324
aVAnd this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.
p325
aVIn 1623, Galileo wrote this:
p326
aV"Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze,
p327
aVis written in the language of mathematics.
p328
aVIts characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures,
p329
aVwithout which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it;
p330
aVwithout these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
p331
aa(lp332
VI believe this to be true,
p333
aVand I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance
p334
aVin describing the mathematics of particle physics
p335
aVusing only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.
p336
aVOf course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff,
p337
aVthe mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.
p338
aVBut it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics
p339
aVis pure, beautiful geometry.
p340
aVJoined with quantum mechanics,
p341
aVthis mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral,
p342
aVwith particles interacting at every location in all possible ways
p343
aVaccording to a beautiful pattern.
p344
aVAnd as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines
p345
aVlike the Large Hadron Collider,
p346
aVwe may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
p347
aa(lp348
VThis process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
p349
aVIf the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern,
p350
aVthat will be very, very cool.
p351
aVIf the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern \u2014
p352
aVwell, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
p353
aVAnd, of course, bad for me personally.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VNow, how bad would that be?
p358
aVWell, pretty bad.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VBut predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
p363
aVThis theory and others like it are long shots.
p364
aVOne does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas
p365
aVprobably won't end up being true about nature.
p366
aVThat's what doing theoretical physics is like:
p367
aVthere are a lot of wipeouts.
p368
aVIn this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
p369
aVAs with any large investment,
p370
aVit can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research
p371
aVwhen it isn't working out.
p372
aVBut in science, if something isn't working,
p373
aVyou have to toss it out and try something else.
p374
aa(lp375
VNow, the only way to maintain sanity
p376
aVand achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty
p377
aVis to keep balance and perspective in life.
p378
aVI've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VI try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing \u2014
p383
aVmy own three charge directions.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VThis way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing,
p388
aVI still know I've lived a good life.
p389
aVAnd I try to live in beautiful places.
p390
aVFor most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui,
p391
aVa very beautiful place.
p392
aVNow, it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents
p393
aVhow I managed to survive all that time
p394
aVwithout engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VI'm going to let you in on that secret.
p399
aVThis was a view from my home office on Maui.
p400
aVAnd this is another,
p401
aVand another.
p402
aVAnd you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar,
p403
aVbut in slightly different places.
p404
aVThat's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VI've chosen a very unusual life.
p409
aVBut not worrying about rent
p410
aVallowed me to spend my time doing what I love.
p411
aVLiving a nomadic existence has been hard at times,
p412
aVbut it's allowed me to live in beautiful places
p413
aVand keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
p414
aVIt allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.
p415
aVBut I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent people.
p416
aVSo I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you very much.
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VChris Anderson: Stay here one second.
p423
aa(lp424
V(Applause)
p425
aa(lp426
VI probably understood two percent of that,
p427
aVbut I still absolutely loved it.
p428
aVSo I'm going to sound dumb.
p429
aVYour theory of everything \u2014
p430
aa(lp431
VGarrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
p432
aa(lp433
VCA: That's right.
p434
aVThe reason it's got a few people at least excited
p435
aVis because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.
p436
aVSo are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart \u2014
p437
aVthat the smallest things that there are,
p438
aVare somehow an E8 object of possibility?
p439
aVI mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?
p440
aa(lp441
VGL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you
p442
aVthat corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics \u2014
p443
aVthat already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
p444
aVAnd that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
p445
aVAnd that shape has remarkable similarities \u2014
p446
aVand the way it fits into this E8 pattern, which could be the rest of the picture.
p447
aVAnd these patterns of points that I've shown for you
p448
aVactually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object
p449
aVthat would be warping and moving and dancing
p450
aVover the space-time that we experience.
p451
aVAnd that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.
p452
aa(lp453
VCA: But a string theorist, as I understand it,
p454
aVexplains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating \u2014
p455
aVI know, you don't like string theory \u2014 vibrating inside it.
p456
aVHow should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
p457
aa(lp458
VGL: Well, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
p459
aVSo what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting.
p460
aVAnd the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see.
p461
aVSo it would be \u2014
p462
aa(lp463
VCA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?
p464
aVI feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
p465
aa(lp466
VGL: As far as we know, electrons are point particles,
p467
aVso this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
p468
aVSo the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is,
p469
aVall possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
p470
aVAnd this is why I use the analogy to coral.
p471
aVAnd \u2014
p472
aVin this way, the way that E8 comes in
p473
aVis it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time.
p474
aVAnd, as I said, the way the shape twists \u2014
p475
aVthe directional along which way the shape is twisting
p476
aVas it moves over this curved surface \u2014
p477
aVis what the elementary particles are, themselves.
p478
aVSo through quantum field theory,
p479
aVthey manifest themselves as points and interact that way.
p480
aVI don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.
p481
aa(lp482
V(Laughter)
p483
aa(lp484
VCA: It doesn't really matter.
p485
aVIt's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,
p486
aVand I certainly want to understand more of this.
p487
aa(lp488
VBut thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.
