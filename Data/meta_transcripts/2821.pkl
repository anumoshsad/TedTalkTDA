VCancer.
p4
aVMany of us have lost family, friends or loved ones
p5
aVto this horrible disease.
p6
aVI know there are some of you in the audience
p7
aVwho are cancer survivors,
p8
aVor who are fighting cancer at this moment.
p9
aVMy heart goes out to you.
p10
aVWhile this word often conjures up emotions of sadness and anger and fear,
p11
aVI bring you good news from the front lines of cancer research.
p12
aVThe fact is, we are starting to win the war on cancer.
p13
aVIn fact, we lie at the intersection
p14
aVof the three of the most exciting developments within cancer research.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe first is cancer genomics.
p17
aVThe genome is a composition
p18
aVof all the genetic information encoded by DNA
p19
aVin an organism.
p20
aVIn cancers, changes in the DNA called mutations
p21
aVare what drive these cancers to go out of control.
p22
aVAround 10 years ago, I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins
p23
aVthat first mapped the mutations of cancers.
p24
aVWe did this first for colorectal,
p25
aVbreast, pancreatic and brain cancers.
p26
aVAnd since then, there have been over 90 projects in 70 countries
p27
aVall over the world,
p28
aVworking to understand the genetic basis of these diseases.
p29
aVToday, tens of thousands of cancers are understood
p30
aVdown to exquisite molecular detail.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe second revolution is precision medicine,
p33
aValso known as "personalized medicine."
p34
aVInstead of one-size-fits-all methods to be able to treat cancers,
p35
aVthere is a whole new class of drugs that are able to target cancers
p36
aVbased on their unique genetic profile.
p37
aVToday, there are a host of these tailor-made drugs,
p38
aVcalled targeted therapies,
p39
aVavailable to physicians even today
p40
aVto be able to personalize their therapy for their patients,
p41
aVand many others are in development.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe third exciting revolution is immunotherapy,
p44
aVand this is really exciting.
p45
aVScientists have been able to leverage the immune system
p46
aVin the fight against cancer.
p47
aVFor example, there have been ways where we find the off switches of cancer,
p48
aVand new drugs have been able to turn the immune system back on,
p49
aVto be able to fight cancer.
p50
aVIn addition, there are ways where you can take away immune cells
p51
aVfrom the body,
p52
aVtrain them, engineer them and put them back into the body
p53
aVto fight cancer.
p54
aVAlmost sounds like science fiction, doesn't it?
p55
aa(lp56
VWhile I was a researcher at the National Cancer Institute,
p57
aVI had the privilege of working with some of the pioneers of this field
p58
aVand watched the development firsthand.
p59
aVIt's been pretty amazing.
p60
aVToday, over 600 clinical trials are open,
p61
aVactively recruiting patients to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhile these three exciting revolutions are ongoing,
p64
aVunfortunately, this is only the beginning,
p65
aVand there are still many, many challenges.
p66
aVLet me illustrate with a patient.
p67
aVHere is a patient with a skin cancer called melanoma.
p68
aVIt's horrible; the cancer has gone everywhere.
p69
aVHowever, scientists were able to map the mutations of this cancer
p70
aVand give a specific treatment that targets one of the mutations.
p71
aVAnd the result is almost miraculous.
p72
aVTumors almost seem to melt away.
p73
aVUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story.
p74
aVA few months later, this picture is taken.
p75
aVThe tumor has come back.
p76
aVThe question is: Why?
p77
aVThe answer is tumor heterogeneity.
p78
aVLet me explain.
p79
aa(lp80
VEven a cancer as small as one centimeter in diameter
p81
aVharbors over a hundred million different cells.
p82
aVWhile genetically similar,
p83
aVthere are small differences in these different cancers
p84
aVthat make them differently prone to different drugs.
p85
aVSo even if you have a drug that's highly effective,
p86
aVthat kills almost all the cells,
p87
aVthere is a chance that there's a small population
p88
aVthat's resistant to the drug.
p89
aVThis ultimately is the population
p90
aVthat comes back,
p91
aVand takes over the patient.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo then the question is: What do we do with this information?
p94
aVWell, the key, then,
p95
aVis to apply all these exciting advancements in cancer therapy earlier,
p96
aVas soon as we can,
p97
aVbefore these resistance clones emerge.
p98
aVThe key to cancer and curing cancer is early detection.
p99
aVAnd we intuitively know this.
p100
aVFinding cancer early results in better outcomes,
p101
aVand the numbers show this as well.
p102
aVFor example, in ovarian cancer, if you detect cancer in stage four,
p103
aVonly 17 percent of the women survive at five years.
p104
aVHowever, if you are able to detect this cancer as early as stage one,
p105
aVover 92 percent of women will survive.
p106
aVBut the sad fact is, only 15 percent of women are detected at stage one,
p107
aVwhereas the vast majority, 70 percent, are detected in stages three and four.
p108
aa(lp109
VWe desperately need better detection mechanisms for cancers.
p110
aVThe current best ways to screen cancer fall into one of three categories.
p111
aVFirst is medical procedures,
p112
aVwhich is like colonoscopy for colon cancer.
p113
aVSecond is protein biomarkers, like PSA for prostate cancer.
p114
aVOr third, imaging techniques,
p115
aVsuch as mammography for breast cancer.
p116
aVMedical procedures are the gold standard;
p117
aVhowever, they are highly invasive
p118
aVand require a large infrastructure to implement.
p119
aVProtein markers, while effective in some populations,
p120
aVare not very specific in some circumstances,
p121
aVresulting in high numbers of false positives,
p122
aVwhich then results in unnecessary work-ups and unnecessary procedures.
p123
aVImaging methods, while useful in some populations,
p124
aVexpose patients to harmful radiation.
p125
aVIn addition, it is not applicable to all patients.
p126
aVFor example, mammography has problems in women with dense breasts.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo what we need is a method that is noninvasive,
p129
aVthat is light in infrastructure,
p130
aVthat is highly specific,
p131
aVthat also does not have false positives,
p132
aVdoes not use any radiation
p133
aVand is applicable to large populations.
p134
aVEven more importantly,
p135
aVwe need a method to be able to detect cancers
p136
aVbefore they're 100 million cells in size.
p137
aVDoes such a technology exist?
p138
aVWell, I wouldn't be up here giving a talk if it didn't.
p139
aa(lp140
VI'm excited to tell you about this latest technology we've developed.
p141
aVCentral to our technology is a simple blood test.
p142
aVThe blood circulatory system, while seemingly mundane,
p143
aVis essential for you to survive,
p144
aVproviding oxygen and nutrients to your cells,
p145
aVand removing waste and carbon dioxide.
p146
aVHere's a key biological insight:
p147
aVCancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells,
p148
aVand when they die,
p149
aVDNA is shed into the blood system.
p150
aVSince we know the signatures of these cancer cells
p151
aVfrom all the different cancer genome sequencing projects,
p152
aVwe can look for those signals in the blood
p153
aVto be able to detect these cancers early.
p154
aVSo instead of waiting for cancers to be large enough to cause symptoms,
p155
aVor for them to be dense enough to show up on imaging,
p156
aVor for them to be prominent enough
p157
aVfor you to be able to visualize on medical procedures,
p158
aVwe can start looking for cancers while they are relatively pretty small,
p159
aVby looking for these small amounts of DNA in the blood.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo let me tell you how we do this.
p162
aVFirst, like I said, we start off with a simple blood test \u2014
p163
aVno radiation, no complicated equipment \u2014
p164
aVa simple blood test.
p165
aVThen the blood is shipped to us,
p166
aVand what we do is extract the DNA out of it.
p167
aVWhile your body is mostly healthy cells,
p168
aVmost of the DNA that's detected will be from healthy cells.
p169
aVHowever, there will be a small amount, less than one percent,
p170
aVthat comes from the cancer cells.
p171
aVThen we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA
p172
aVfor areas of the genome which are known to be associated with cancer,
p173
aVbased on the information from the cancer genomics projects.
p174
aVWe're able to then put this DNA into DNA-sequencing machines
p175
aVand are able to digitize the DNA into A's, C's, T's and G's
p176
aVand have this final readout.
p177
aVUltimately, we have information of billions of letters
p178
aVthat output from this run.
p179
aVWe then apply statistical and computational methods
p180
aVto be able to find the small signal that's present,
p181
aVindicative of the small amount of cancer DNA in the blood.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo does this actually work in patients?
p184
aVWell, because there's no way of really predicting right now
p185
aVwhich patients will get cancer,
p186
aVwe use the next best population:
p187
aVcancers in remission;
p188
aVspecifically, lung cancer.
p189
aVThe sad fact is, even with the best drugs that we have today,
p190
aVmost lung cancers come back.
p191
aVThe key, then, is to see
p192
aVwhether we're able to detect these recurrences of cancers
p193
aVearlier than with standard methods.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe just finished a major trial
p196
aVwith Professor Charles Swanton at University College London,
p197
aVexamining this.
p198
aVLet me walk you through an example of one patient.
p199
aVHere's an example of one patient who undergoes surgery
p200
aVat time point zero,
p201
aVand then undergoes chemotherapy.
p202
aVThen the patient is under remission.
p203
aVHe is monitored using clinical exams and imaging methods.
p204
aVAround day 450, unfortunately, the cancer comes back.
p205
aVThe question is: Are we able to catch this earlier?
p206
aVDuring this whole time, we've been collecting blood serially
p207
aVto be able to measure the amount of ctDNA in the blood.
p208
aVSo at the initial time point, as expected,
p209
aVthere's a high level of cancer DNA in the blood.
p210
aVHowever, this goes away to zero in subsequent time points
p211
aVand remains negligible after subsequent points.
p212
aVHowever, around day 340, we see the rise of cancer DNA in the blood,
p213
aVand eventually, it goes up higher for days 400 and 450.
p214
aa(lp215
VHere's the key, if you've missed it:
p216
aVAt day 340, we see the rise in the cancer DNA in the blood.
p217
aVThat means we are catching this cancer over a hundred days earlier
p218
aVthan traditional methods.
p219
aVThis is a hundred days earlier where we can give therapies,
p220
aVa hundred days earlier where we can do surgical interventions,
p221
aVor even a hundred days less for the cancer to grow
p222
aVor a hundred days less for resistance to occur.
p223
aVFor some patients, this hundred days means the matter of life and death.
p224
aVWe're really excited about this information.
p225
aa(lp226
VBecause of this assignment, we've done additional studies now
p227
aVin other cancers,
p228
aVincluding breast cancer, lung cancer
p229
aVand ovarian cancer,
p230
aVand I can't wait to see how much earlier we can find these cancers.
p231
aa(lp232
VUltimately, I have a dream,
p233
aVa dream of two vials of blood,
p234
aVand that, in the future, as part of all of our standard physical exams,
p235
aVwe'll have two vials of blood drawn.
p236
aVAnd from these two vials of blood we will be able to compare
p237
aVthe DNA from all known signatures of cancer,
p238
aVand hopefully then detect cancers months to even years earlier.
p239
aVEven with the therapies we have currently,
p240
aVthis could mean that millions of lives could be saved.
p241
aVAnd if you add on to that recent advancements in immunotherapy
p242
aVand targeted therapies,
p243
aVthe end of cancer is in sight.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe next time you hear the word "cancer,"
p246
aVI want you to add to the emotions: hope.
p247
aVHold on.
p248
aVCancer researchers all around the world are working feverishly
p249
aVto beat this disease,
p250
aVand tremendous progress is being made.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is the beginning of the end.
p253
aVWe will win the war on cancer.
p254
aVAnd to me, this is amazing news.
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you.
