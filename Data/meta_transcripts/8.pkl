VKurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight
p4
aVbut is sufficiently reticent \u2014 or at least pretends to be \u2014
p5
aVthat he asked me to question him rather than speaking.
p6
aVIn fact what we're going to talk about,
p7
aVI think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served
p8
aVby a conversation than an address.
p9
aVAnd I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
p10
aa(lp11
VDan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,
p12
aVmany people have flocked to downtown New York to see
p13
aVand pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.
p14
aVNow, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches
p15
aVon a new way for people to visit and view the scene.
p16
aa(lp17
VJim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.
p18
aVThere's a new place in New York
p19
aVwhere the crowds are thickest \u2014 Ground Zero.
p20
aa(lp21
VTourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.
p22
aVThis was \u2014 out of all the tourist sites in New York City \u2014
p23
aVthis was her number-one pick.
p24
aa(lp25
VJA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.
p26
aa(lp27
VTourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.
p28
aa(lp29
VJA: Even on the coldest winter days.
p30
aVTo honor and remember.
p31
aa(lp32
VTourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.
p33
aVThis is ours.
p34
aa(lp35
VJA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become
p36
aVa bit of a problem.
p37
aa(lp38
VTourist: I think that people are very frustrated
p39
aVthat they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.
p40
aa(lp41
VJA: But that is about to change.
p42
aVIn record time,
p43
aVa team of architects and construction workers
p44
aVdesigned and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration
p45
aVand bring people closer.
p46
aa(lp47
VMan: They'll get an incredible panorama
p48
aVand understand, I think more completely,
p49
aVthe sheer totality of the destruction of the place.
p50
aa(lp51
VJA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike
p52
aVmost any other tourist site in America.
p53
aVUnlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,
p54
aVpeople come here to see what's no longer there.
p55
aa(lp56
VDavid Rockwell: The first experience people will have here
p57
aVwhen they see this is not as a construction site
p58
aVbut as this incredibly moving burial ground.
p59
aa(lp60
VJA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them
p61
aVwith their own memorials the way they already have
p62
aValong the current perimeter.
p63
aa(lp64
VTourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.
p65
aa(lp66
VJA: The ramps are made of simple material \u2014
p67
aVthe kind of plywood you see at construction sites \u2014
p68
aVwhich is really the whole point.
p69
aVIn the face of America's worst destruction
p70
aVpeople are building again.
p71
aVJim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
p72
aa(lp73
VKA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,
p74
aVbut certainly David you are known as \u2014 I know, a phrase you hate \u2014
p75
aVan entertainment architect.
p76
aVYour work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.
p77
aa(lp78
VDR: I like that word.
p79
aa(lp80
VKA: It's about pleasure \u2014 casinos and hotels and restaurants.
p81
aVHow did the shock that all of us \u2014 and especially all of us in New York \u2014
p82
aVfelt on the 11th of September transmute
p83
aVinto your desire to do this thing?
p84
aa(lp85
VDR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,
p86
aVI felt myself in the role originally \u2014
p87
aVfirst of all as someone who lives in Tribeca
p88
aVand whose neighborhood was devastated,
p89
aVand as someone who works less than a mile from there \u2014
p90
aVthat I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me
p91
aVin my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm
p92
aVabout creating the places we had been creating.
p93
aVIn fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure,"
p94
aVwhich is about sensual pleasure in spaces.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut I've got to tell you \u2014 it became impossible to do that.
p97
aVWe were really paralyzed.
p98
aVAnd I found myself the Friday after September 11th \u2014
p99
aVtwo days afterwards \u2014
p100
aVliterally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.
p101
aVWe gave the office a few days off.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd in discussing this with other architects,
p104
aVwe had seen people saying in the press
p105
aVthat they should rebuild the towers as they were \u2014
p106
aVthey should rebuild them 50 stories taller.
p107
aVAnd I thought it was astonishing to speculate,
p108
aVas if this were a competition,
p109
aVon something that was such a fresh wound.
p110
aVAnd I had a series of discussions \u2014
p111
aVfirst with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,
p112
aVand several other people \u2014
p113
aVand really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.
p114
aVAnd that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help
p115
aVwasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,
p116
aVbut to help right now.
p117
aVSo we tried to come up with a way,
p118
aVas a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.
p119
aVAnd that was the mission that we came up with.
p120
aa(lp121
VKA: Were you conscious of suddenly \u2014
p122
aVas a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants \u2014
p123
aVsuddenly fulfilling needs?
p124
aa(lp125
VDR: Well what I was aware of was,
p126
aVthere was this overwhelming need to act now.
p127
aVAnd we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.
p128
aVThere was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
p129
aVThey moved to an abandoned school.
p130
aVWe took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,
p131
aVand over four days \u2014 it was like this urban barn-raising \u2014
p132
aVto renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.
p133
aVIt was just extraordinary.
p134
aVTom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed
p135
aVand it became this cathartic experience for us.
p136
aa(lp137
VKA: And that was done, effectively,
p138
aVby October 8 or something?
p139
aa(lp140
VDR: Yeah.
p141
aa(lp142
VKA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something
p143
aVas substantial as this project \u2014 and this is only one of four
p144
aVthat you've designed to surround the site \u2014
p145
aVyou must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,
p146
aVentrenched bureaucracy and powers that be
p147
aVin New York real estate and New York politics.
p148
aa(lp149
VDR: Well, it's a funny thing.
p150
aVWe finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.
p151
aVI was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.
p152
aVAnd I sat in on several meetings.
p153
aVAnd there were the most circuitous grand plans
p154
aVthat had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
p155
aVAnd the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,
p156
aVand there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.
p157
aVAnd it wasn't an inclusive group.
p158
aVSo we said, what is \u2014
p159
aa(lp160
VKA: It was not an inclusive group?
p161
aa(lp162
VDR: It was not an inclusive group.
p163
aVIt was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group
p164
aVthat was not representative of the city.
p165
aa(lp166
VKA: Shocking.
p167
aa(lp168
VDR: Yeah, surprising.
p169
aVSo Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.
p170
aVThe city actually approached us.
p171
aVWe first approached the city about Pier 94.
p172
aVWe saw how PS 234 worked.
p173
aVThe families \u2014 the victims of the families \u2014
p174
aVwere going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
p175
aa(lp176
VKA: On the Hudson River?
p177
aa(lp178
VDR: Yeah. And the city actually \u2014 through Tim Zagat initially,
p179
aVand then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani \u2014
p180
aVsaid, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,
p181
aVbut we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero
p182
aVthat we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,
p183
aVand a way to protect it from the weather."
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,
p186
aVand I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.
p187
aVIt was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,
p188
aVwhere the families of the victims had left notes to them.
p189
aVAnd there was no mediation between us and the experience.
p190
aVThere was no filter.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,
p193
aVthe roof of our building \u2014 we can see the World Trade Towers prominently \u2014
p194
aVand I saw the first building collapse from a conference room
p195
aVon the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.
p196
aVAnd then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.
p197
aVAnd it was amazing how much harder it was
p198
aVto believe in real life than it was on TV.
p199
aVThere was something about the comfort of the filter
p200
aVand how much information was between us and the experience.
p201
aVSo seeing this in a very simple,
p202
aVdignified way was a very powerful experience.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo we went back to the city and said
p205
aVwe're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,
p206
aVbut we've spent some time down there.
p207
aVAt the same time the city had this need.
p208
aVThey were looking for a solution
p209
aVto deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day
p210
aVwho were going down there, that had nowhere to go.
p211
aVAnd there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.
p212
aVSo dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
p213
aVThere was a way \u2014 there had to be a way \u2014
p214
aVto get people to move around the site.
p215
aa(lp216
VKA: But then you've got to figure out a way \u2014
p217
aVwe will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits
p218
aVand getting everybody on board \u2014 but simply funding this thing.
p219
aVIt looks like a fairly simple thing,
p220
aVbut this was a half a million dollar project?
p221
aa(lp222
VDR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,
p223
aVit wasn't going to happen.
p224
aVAnd we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen
p225
aVby the end of the Giuliani administration,
p226
aVthen everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT
p227
aVand the Police Department and all of the \u2014
p228
aVwe were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,
p229
aVand it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.
p230
aVThis incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,
p231
aVand they sensed that this needed to happen.
p232
aa(lp233
VKA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,
p234
aVbecause Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.
p235
aa(lp236
VDR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this \u2014
p237
aVwe had to work with the families of the victims,
p238
aVthrough the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.
p239
aVBecause this didn't want to be a surprise.
p240
aVAnd we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,
p241
aVbecause the key was not raising a lot of objection
p242
aVand sort of working as quietly as possible.
p243
aa(lp244
VWe came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,
p245
aVmainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,
p246
aVhe would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.
p247
aVThere needed to be a foundation in place.
p248
aVSo we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was
p249
aVone major developer in New York \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
VKA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?
p252
aa(lp253
VDR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,
p254
aVif that helps anyone \u2014 volunteered to help.
p255
aVAnd we met with him.
p256
aVThe prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.
p257
aVAnd Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,
p258
aVvolunteered to do it at cost.
p259
aVSo this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."
p260
aVAnd we said, "That's incredible!"
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd I think this was the 21st,
p263
aVand we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.
p264
aVAnd we had to start construction the next day.
p265
aVWe had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,
p266
aVand the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform
p267
aVabout half the size that we had drawn it.
p268
aa(lp269
VKA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get
p270
aVthe tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VDR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
p274
aVThere was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul \u2014
p275
aVthat this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,
p276
aVand a place to reflect and remember.
p277
aVAnd I've got to say that we spent a lot of time
p278
aVin putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul \u2014
p279
aVwhich is just to the right \u2014 and moving around the site.
p280
aVAnd I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I think people were amazed at two things \u2014
p283
aVI think they were amazed at the destruction,
p284
aVbut I think there was a sense of disbelief
p285
aVabout the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.
p286
aVJust the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,
p289
aV"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer
p290
aVwill not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."
p291
aVAnd we said, "Well, this is half the size,
p292
aVit doesn't have any of the design features
p293
aVthat have been agreed upon by everyone \u2014 everyone in the city.
p294
aVWe'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."
p295
aVAnd I convinced him that we should leave the room
p296
aVwith the agreement to build it as designed.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe next day I got an email from the developer
p299
aVsaying that he was withdrawing all funding.
p300
aVSo we didn't know what to do,
p301
aVbut we decided to cast a very wide net.
p302
aVWe emailed out letters to as many people as we could \u2014
p303
aVseveral people in the audience here \u2014 who were very helpful.
p304
aa(lp305
VKA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?
p306
aa(lp307
VDR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.
p308
aVHe had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.
p309
aVWe knew that one way or another this was going to happen.
p310
aVAnd we just felt it had to happen.
p311
aa(lp312
VKA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.
p313
aVRichard, I think very correctly,
p314
aVmade the point at the beginning \u2014
p315
aVbefore all the chair designers came out \u2014
p316
aVabout the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions
p317
aVon this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.
p318
aVIt seems to me with this,
p319
aVthat it was the opposite of that.
p320
aVThis was an unprecedented, singular design problem.
p321
aa(lp322
VDR: Well here's the issue:
p323
aVwe knew that this was not in the sense of \u2014
p324
aVwe think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.
p325
aVIt was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.
p326
aVThat this was a place for people to reflect, to remember \u2014
p327
aVa kind of quiet place.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo it led us to using design solutions
p330
aVthat created as few filters between the viewer \u2014
p331
aVas we said about the families' platform \u2014 and the experience as possible.
p332
aVIt's all incredibly humble material.
p333
aVIt's scaffolding and plywood.
p334
aVAnd it allows \u2014 by sort of the procession of the movement,
p335
aVup by Saint Paul's and down the other side \u2014
p336
aVit gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground
p337
aVto where you get the 360 degree view.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.
p340
aVOne of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.
p341
aVBecause when we looked at the four platforms around the site,
p342
aVone of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,
p343
aVwe knew that these had to be moveable
p344
aVto respond to changing conditions,
p345
aVand the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.
p346
aa(lp347
VKA: Your work \u2014 I mean, we've talked about this before \u2014
p348
aVa lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on
p349
aVthe temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,
p350
aVand a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"
p351
aVsort of sense of existence.
p352
aVThis is clearly not a work for the ages.
p353
aVYou know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.
p354
aVDid that require, as an architect,
p355
aVa new way of thinking about what you were doing?
p356
aVTo think of it as this purely temporary installation?
p357
aa(lp358
VDR: No, I don't think so.
p359
aVI think this is, obviously, substantially different
p360
aVfrom anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.
p361
aVWhere it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,
p362
aVnumber one \u2014 the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.
p363
aVAnd Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller
p364
aVand all the people within the city \u2014
p365
aVNorman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,
p366
aVoffered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
p367
aVSo the notion of collaboration \u2014
p368
aVI think this reinforces how important that is.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd in terms of the temporary nature of it,
p371
aVour goal was not to create something
p372
aVthat would be there longer than it needed to be.
p373
aVI think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
p374
aVthat we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,
p375
aVabout what's really happening there.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,
p378
aVwhere he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.
p379
aVWhich was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.
p380
aVAnd I think regardless of what the position is about how
p381
aVthis sacred piece of land is to be used,
p382
aVhaving it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,
p383
aVI think makes it a more powerful dialogue.
p384
aVAnd that's what we were interested in.
p385
aVSo that, very much, is in the realm of things
p386
aVI've been interested in before.
p387
aa(lp388
VKA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
p389
aVIt enables that conversation to get serious.
p390
aVAnd six months after the fact \u2014
p391
aVand only a few months away from the site being cleaned \u2014
p392
aVwe are very quickly, now, getting to the point
p393
aVwhere those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.
p394
aVDo you have \u2014 having been as physically involved in the site
p395
aVas you have been doing this project \u2014 have any ideas about
p396
aVwhat should or shouldn't be done?
p397
aa(lp398
VDR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate \u2014
p399
aVI think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.
p400
aVThe Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,
p401
aVwhich had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.
p402
aa(lp403
VKA: But it had some really terrible ideas.
p404
aa(lp405
VDR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,
p406
aVwhere I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.
p407
aVAnd I think there should be a broader \u2014 which there's starting to be \u2014
p408
aVthe dialogue is really opening up to,
p409
aVwhat does this site really want to be?
p410
aVAnd I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,
p411
aVthat it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.
p412
aVThere's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,
p413
aVabout depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,
p414
aVso that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.
p415
aa(lp416
VKA: Well, I think that's interesting.
p417
aVAnd it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate
p418
aVto discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,
p419
aVwhich is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,
p420
aVas what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.
p421
aVIs this an opportunity, is the silver lining \u2014
p422
aVa silver lining, here \u2014 to rebuild
p423
aVsome more traditional city grid, or not?
p424
aa(lp425
VDR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage
p426
aVin a discussion of why we live in cities.
p427
aVAnd why do we live in places where such dissimilar people
p428
aVcollide up against us each day?
p429
aVI don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,
p430
aVregardless of what the number is.
p431
aVSo yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.
p434
aa(lp435
VKA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?
p436
aa(lp437
VDR: Right, which the towers fell into.
p438
aVAnd the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage
p439
aVthat they're not re-opening the street
p440
aVto connect that back to the rest of the city.
p441
aVI think a public dialogue \u2014 I think, you know,
p442
aVI'd like to see an international competition,
p443
aVand a call for ideas for uses.
p444
aa(lp445
VKA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,
p446
aVwhether it's what amount of shopping?
p447
aa(lp448
VDR: Right. And we're looking for other things.
p449
aVThis small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.
p450
aVIncluding taking a small piece adjacent to the site
p451
aVand inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice
p452
aVin New York to do artist housing.
p453
aVAnd find other ways to encourage the discussion
p454
aVto be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,
p455
aVand more about a multiplicity of things.
p456
aa(lp457
VKA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video
p458
aVof the experience of being on this platform?
p459
aa(lp460
VDR: John Kamen \u2014 who's here, actually \u2014 put together
p461
aVa two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.
p462
aVSo I thought that would be good to end with.
p463
aa(lp464
VDR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.
p465
aVOne of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration
p466
aVwas I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.
p467
aVAnd essentially our structure was designed to be written on.
p468
aa(lp469
VKA: As you say, it's not a memorial.
p470
aVBut were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?
p471
aVThose kinds of forms?
p472
aa(lp473
VDR: We certainly did as much research as we could,
p474
aVand we were conscious of other memorials.
p475
aVAnd also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.
p476
aVIt's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,
p477
aVwhich is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution
p478
aVthat expanded on Union Square
p479
aVand the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.
p480
aa(lp481
VThe scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.
p482
aa(lp483
VWhat's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,
p484
aVso that what you're aware of
p485
aVis not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,
p486
aVbut all of the buildings around it \u2014
p487
aVand the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.
p488
aVThis shows Saint Paul's on the left.
p489
aa(lp490
VKA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers
p491
aVfor making this happen and getting this done.
p492
aVBut the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,
p493
aVand its being there,
p494
aValmost before you could believe
p495
aVthat a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,
p496
aVis part of its extraordinary \u2014
p497
aVI don't know if beauty is the word \u2014
p498
aVbut presence.
p499
aa(lp500
VDR: It was an honor to do.
p501
aVAnd we were thrilled to be able to show it here.
