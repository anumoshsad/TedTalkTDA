p4
aVquickly start out with
p5
aVa little bit of music here. (Applause)

p10
aa(lp11

p12
aa(lp13
VI took my shoes off to dance,
p14
aVbut maybe I'll get at that later.
p15
aVAnyways, I... where to start?
p16
aVWell, I'm really excited
p17
aVto talk a bit about
p18
aVmy own upbringing in music
p19
aVand family and all of that,
p20
aVbut I'm even more excited for you people
p21
aVto hear about Donnell's amazing family
p22
aVand maybe even a little bit about
p23
aVhow we met,
p24
aVand all that sort of thing,
p25
aVbut for those of you that may not
p26
aVbe familiar with my upbringing,
p27
aVI'm from Cape Breton Island,
p28
aVNova Scotia, eastern Canada,
p29
aVwhich is a very, very musical island,
p30
aVand its origins come from Scotland
p31
aVwith the music and all the traditions,
p32
aVthe dancing, the language,
p33
aVwhich unfortunately is dying out
p34
aVin Cape Breton.
p35
aVThe traditional language is Gaelic,
p36
aVbut a lot of the music came
p37
aVfrom the Gaelic language,
p38
aVand the dancing and the singing
p39
aVand everything, and my bloodline
p40
aVis Scottish through and through,
p41
aVbut my mother and father
p42
aVare two very, very musical people.
p43
aa(lp44
VMy mom taught me to dance
p45
aVwhen I was five, and my dad
p46
aVtaught me to play fiddle when I was nine.
p47
aVMy uncle is a very well-known
p48
aVCape Breton fiddler.
p49
aVHis name's Buddy MacMaster,
p50
aVand just a wonderful guy,
p51
aVand we have a great tradition at home
p52
aVcalled square dancing,
p53
aVand we had parties, great parties
p54
aVat our house and the neighbors' houses,
p55
aVand you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
p56
aVWell, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,
p57
aVbut kitchen party
p58
aVin Cape Breton is very common,
p59
aVand basically somebody drops into the house,
p60
aVand no matter what house you go to
p61
aVin Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,
p62
aVguaranteed, and I'd say,
p63
aVwell there's first of all more fiddlers
p64
aVper capita in Cape Breton than anywhere
p65
aVin the world, so ten chances to one,
p66
aVthe fellow who walked in the door
p67
aVcould play it, so you'd have someone come
p68
aVinto the house, you'd invite them to play
p69
aVa tune, and lo and behold
p70
aVa little party would start up and somebody would dance,
p71
aVand somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,
p72
aVso it was a wonderful, wonderful way
p73
aVto grow up, and that is where
p74
aVmy beginnings in music come from:
p75
aVmy surroundings, my family,
p76
aVjust my bloodline in itself, and, oh,
p77
aVI've done lots of things with my music.
p78
aa(lp79
VI've recorded lots of CDs.
p80
aVI was nominated for a Grammy and
p81
aVI've won some awards and stuff like that,
p82
aVso that's awesome,
p83
aVbut the best part was meeting my husband,
p84
aVand I've actually known Donnell
p85
aVfor probably 12 years now, and
p86
aVI'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,
p87
aVhow music brought us together,
p88
aVbut I'm going to introduce you
p89
aVright now to my new husband
p90
aVas of October 5,
p91
aVDonnell Leahy. (Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
V(Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VDonnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED
p96
aVexperience and I'm glad to be here,
p97
aVbut I'm just trying to put it all together,
p98
aVtrying to figure all you people out, and I've
p99
aVbeen here for a short while, and I'm starting
p100
aVto understand a little bit better.
p101
aVSo I asked Natalie, what do I do?
p102
aVAnd she said, just talk about yourself.
p103
aa(lp104
VIt's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little
p105
aVbit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers
p106
aVand sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,
p107
aVan hour and a half northeast of Toronto,
p108
aVand we grew up on a farm.
p109
aVMom and Dad raised beef cattle,
p110
aVand I'm the oldest boy.
p111
aVThere are four girls a little bit older than me.
p112
aVWe grew up without a television.
p113
aVPeople find that strange,
p114
aVbut I think it was a great blessing for us.
p115
aVWe had a television for a few years,
p116
aVbut of course we wasted so much time
p117
aVand the work wasn't getting done,
p118
aVso out went the television.
p119
aa(lp120
VWe grew up playing\u2014
p121
aVMom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.
p122
aVMom and Natalie's mother
p123
aVknew each other. We grew up playing,
p124
aVand used to dance together, right, yeah.
p125
aV(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,
p126
aVwe played by ear and I think
p127
aVthat's important for us because
p128
aVwe were not really exposed to a lot of
p129
aVdifferent styles of music.
p130
aa(lp131
VWe learned to play the instruments,
p132
aVbut we kind of had to come from within
p133
aVor go from within, because we didn't
p134
aVwatch television, we didn't listen to a lot of
p135
aVradio. We went to church
p136
aVand to school sometimes,
p137
aVand farmed and played music,
p138
aVso we were able, I think,
p139
aVat a very critical age to develop
p140
aVour own style, our own self,
p141
aVand my mother plays, my father plays,
p142
aVand the style that came
p143
aVfrom the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,
p144
aVwe call it French-Canadian style
p145
aVbut it originated in logging camps.
p146
aVYears ago, hundreds of men would go
p147
aVup for the winter to the camps
p148
aVin Northern Ontario and in Quebec,
p149
aVand they were all different cultures,
p150
aVand the Irish, the French, Scottish,
p151
aVGerman, they'd all meet, and of course
p152
aVat night, they'd play cards
p153
aVand step dance and play fiddles,
p154
aVand over the course of many years,
p155
aVthe Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved
p156
aVand the Ottawa Valley step dancing
p157
aVevolved, so that's, I kind of started out
p158
aVwith that style and I quickly
p159
aVstarted doing my own thing,
p160
aVand then I met Natalie, and I was
p161
aVexposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.
p162
aVThat's how we met. (Laughter)
p163
aVYou tell them. (Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VNM: You want to or no? (Laughter)
p166
aVWell I guess I have to now.
p167
aVWell, it's just so interesting that
p168
aVDonnell's upbringing was very similar
p169
aVto mine, and I actually saw Donnell play
p170
aVwhen I was about 12 years old,
p171
aVand he and his family came to
p172
aVInverness, which is about 45 minutes
p173
aVfrom where I lived, and I was just
p174
aVblown away, like, it was just amazing,
p175
aVand you'll find out why pretty soon here,
p176
aVbut I couldn't believe the fiddling
p177
aVand Mom was there with me,
p178
aVand she was saying \u2014
p179
aVDonnell's mother came up on stage
p180
aVand danced with her children, and Mom
p181
aVwas saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,
p182
aVI used to dance with her when we
p183
aVwere kids. Little did I think our children
p184
aVwould be playing instruments, you know,
p185
aVplaying music, yeah."
p186
aa(lp187
VTwelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think
p188
aVher kids would be getting married,
p189
aVbut anyway, so, then I got
p190
aVa phone call about, I dunno,
p191
aVseven years later. I was 19,
p192
aVfirst or second year of college,
p193
aVand it was Donnell, and
p194
aVhe said "Hi, you probably don't know me
p195
aVbut my name is Donnell Leahy."
p196
aVAnd I said, "I know you.
p197
aVI have a tape of yours at home."
p198
aVAnd he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,"
p199
aVwhich is where I was,
p200
aVand he asked me out for supper.
p201
aVThat's it. (Laughter)
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aVThen \u2014 Will I keep going? (Laughs)
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVThen we dated for two years,
p206
aVbroke up for 10, got back together
p207
aVand got married. (Laughter) (Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VDL: So anyway, we're running out of time,
p210
aVso I'll just get to it.
p211
aVI'm going to play a piece of music for you.
p212
aVIt's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
p213
aVI starts out with a slow air.
p214
aVAirs were played in Europe
p215
aVat burials, as a body was carried out
p216
aVfrom the wake site to the burial site,
p217
aVthe procession was led by a piper
p218
aVor a fiddle player.
p219
aVI'll quickly play a short part of the air,
p220
aVand then I'm going to get into
p221
aVkind of a crazy tune that is very difficult
p222
aVto play when you're not warmed up,
p223
aVso, if I mess it up, pretend you like it
p224
aVanyway. It's called The Banks.

aa(lp234
VNM: Well, we're gonna play one
p235
aVtogether now. (Applause)
p236
aVWe're laughing, like, because
p237
aVour styles are totally different,
p238
aVas you can hear.
p239
aVAnd so, you know, Donnell and I
p240
aVare actually in the process of
p241
aVwriting new pieces of music together
p242
aVthat we can play,
p243
aVbut we don't have any of those ready.
p244
aVWe just started yesterday. (Laughter)
p245
aVSo we're gonna play something together anyway.
p246
aa(lp247
VDL: With one minute.
p248
aa(lp249

p250
aa(lp251

VDL: We're going to play a tune
p307
aVand Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.
p308
aVThe Cape Breton piano playing
p309
aVis just awesome. It's very rhythmic
p310
aVand, you'll see it.
p311
aVMy mom plays piano, and she learned
p312
aVto play before they had a piano at home
p313
aVin Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had
p314
aVa piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play
p315
aVthe rhythms on a piece of board,
p316
aVand the fiddlers would all congregate
p317
aVto play on the cold winter's evenings
p318
aVand Mom would be banging on this board,
p319
aVso when they bought a piano,
p320
aVthey bought it in Toronto and had it taken
p321
aVby train and brought in on a horse,
p322
aVa horse and sleigh to the house.
p323
aVIt became the only piano in the region,
p324
aVand Mom said she could basically play
p325
aVas soon as the piano arrived,
p326
aVshe could play it because she had learned
p327
aVall these rhythms. Anyway, we found
p328
aVthe piano last year and were able to
p329
aVbring it back home. We purchased it.
p330
aVIt had gone through, like,
p331
aVfive or six families,
p332
aVand it was just a big thing for us,
p333
aVand we found actually an old picture
p334
aVof somebody and their family years ago.
p335
aVAnyway, I'm blabbering on here.
p336
aa(lp337
VNM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.
p338
aa(lp339
VDL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VNM: Just tell them what\u2014
p342
aa(lp343
VDL: She wants me to talk about\u2014
p344
aVWe have a band named Leahy.
p345
aVThere's 11 siblings. We, um\u2014
p346
aVWhat will I tell them? (Laughter)
p347
aVWe opened\u2014
p348
aa(lp349
VNM: No surgeries.
p350
aa(lp351
VDL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
p352
aVWe had a great opportunity.
p353
aVWe opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.
p354
aVIt was a big thing for us, and now
p355
aVall my sisters are off having babies
p356
aVand the boys are all getting married, so we're
p357
aVstaying close to home for, I guess,
p358
aVanother couple of weeks.
p359
aVWhat can I say? I don't know what to say,
p360
aVNatalie. We, uh... (Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VNM: Is this what marriage is about?
p365
aV(Applause)
p366
aVI like it. (Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
V(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VDL: Oh yeah, okay,
p371
aVin my family we had seven girls, four boys,
p372
aVwe had two fiddles and one piano,
p373
aVand of course we were all fighting to play
p374
aVon the instruments, so dad and mom
p375
aVset a rule that you couldn't kick anyone
p376
aVoff the instrument. You had to wait
p377
aVuntil they were finished, so of course,
p378
aVwhat we would do is we'd get on the piano
p379
aVand you wouldn't even get off to eat,
p380
aVbecause you wouldn't want to give it up
p381
aVto your brother or sister, and they'd wait
p382
aVand wait and wait, and it'd be midnight
p383
aVand you'd be still sitting there on the piano,
p384
aVbut it was their way to get us to practice.
p385
aVWill we play a tune?
p386
aa(lp387
VNM: It worked. DL: It worked.
p388
aVSorry, I hate to carry on...
p389
aVSo this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.
p390
aVOkay, play in, how about A?
