VI am a palliative care physician
p4
aVand I would like to talk to you today about health care.
p5
aVI'd like to talk to you about the health and care
p6
aVof the most vulnerable population in our country \u2014
p7
aVthose people dealing with the most complex serious health issues.
p8
aVI'd like to talk to you about economics as well.
p9
aVAnd the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you \u2014
p10
aVit scares the hell out of me.
p11
aa(lp12
VI'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine:
p13
aVa paradigm of care for this population, grounded in what they value.
p14
aVPatient-centric care based on their values
p15
aVthat helps this population live better and longer.
p16
aVIt's a care model that tells the truth
p17
aVand engages one-on-one
p18
aVand meets people where they're at.
p19
aa(lp20
VI'd like to start by telling the story of my very first patient.
p21
aVIt was my first day as a physician,
p22
aVwith the long white coat ...
p23
aVI stumbled into the hospital
p24
aVand right away there's a gentleman, Harold, 68 years old,
p25
aVcame to the emergency department.
p26
aVHe had had headaches for about six weeks
p27
aVthat got worse and worse and worse and worse.
p28
aVEvaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain.
p29
aVThe attending physician directed me to go share with Harold and his family
p30
aVthe diagnosis, the prognosis and options of care.
p31
aa(lp32
VFive hours into my new career,
p33
aVI did the only thing I knew how.
p34
aVI walked in,
p35
aVsat down,
p36
aVtook Harold's hand,
p37
aVtook his wife's hand
p38
aVand just breathed.
p39
aa(lp40
VHe said, "It's not good news is it, sonny?"
p41
aa(lp42
VI said, "No."
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd so we talked and we listened and we shared.
p45
aVAnd after a while I said,
p46
aV"Harold, what is it that has meaning to you?
p47
aVWhat is it that you hold sacred?"
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd he said,
p50
aV"My family."
p51
aa(lp52
VI said, "What do you want to do?"
p53
aa(lp54
VHe slapped me on the knee and said, "I want to go fishing."
p55
aa(lp56
VI said, "That, I know how to do."
p57
aa(lp58
VHarold went fishing the next day.
p59
aVHe died a week later.
p60
aa(lp61
VAs I've gone through my training in my career,
p62
aVI think back to Harold.
p63
aVAnd I think that this is a conversation
p64
aVthat happens far too infrequently.
p65
aVAnd it's a conversation that had led us to crisis,
p66
aVto the biggest threat to the American way of life today,
p67
aVwhich is health care expenditures.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo what do we know?
p70
aVWe know that this population, the most ill,
p71
aVtakes up 15 percent of the gross domestic product \u2014
p72
aVnearly 2.3 trillion dollars.
p73
aVSo the sickest 15 percent take up 15 percent of the GDP.
p74
aVIf we extrapolate this out over the next two decades
p75
aVwith the growth of baby boomers,
p76
aVat this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.
p77
aVSixty percent of the gross domestic product
p78
aVof the United States of America \u2014
p79
aVit has very little to do with health care at that point.
p80
aVIt has to do with a gallon of milk,
p81
aVwith college tuition.
p82
aVIt has to do with every thing that we value
p83
aVand every thing that we know presently.
p84
aVIt has at stake the free-market economy and capitalism
p85
aVof the United States of America.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet's forget all the statistics for a minute, forget the numbers.
p88
aVLet's talk about the value we get for all these dollars we spend.
p89
aVWell, the Dartmouth Atlas, about six years ago,
p90
aVlooked at every dollar spent by Medicare \u2014
p91
aVgenerally this population.
p92
aVWe found that those patients who have the highest per capita expenditures
p93
aVhad the highest suffering, pain, depression.
p94
aVAnd, more often than not, they die sooner.
p95
aa(lp96
VHow can this be?
p97
aVWe live in the United States,
p98
aVit has the greatest health care system on the planet.
p99
aVWe spend 10 times more on these patients
p100
aVthan the second-leading country in the world.
p101
aVThat doesn't make sense.
p102
aVBut what we know is,
p103
aVout of the top 50 countries on the planet
p104
aVwith organized health care systems,
p105
aVwe rank 37th.
p106
aVFormer Eastern Bloc countries and sub-Saharan African countries
p107
aVrank higher than us as far as quality and value.
p108
aa(lp109
VSomething I experience every day in my practice,
p110
aVand I'm sure, something many of you on your own journeys have experienced:
p111
aVmore is not more.
p112
aVThose individuals who had more tests,
p113
aVmore bells, more whistles,
p114
aVmore chemotherapy, more surgery, more whatever \u2014
p115
aVthe more that we do to someone,
p116
aVit decreases the quality of their life.
p117
aVAnd it shortens it, most often.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo what are we going to do about this?
p120
aVWhat are we doing about this?
p121
aVAnd why is this so?
p122
aVThe grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,
p123
aVis that we, the health care industry \u2014 long white-coat physicians \u2014
p124
aVare stealing from you.
p125
aVStealing from you the opportunity
p126
aVto choose how you want to live your lives
p127
aVin the context of whatever disease it is.
p128
aVWe focus on disease and pathology and surgery
p129
aVand pharmacology.
p130
aVWe miss the human being.
p131
aVHow can we treat this
p132
aVwithout understanding this?
p133
aVWe do things to this;
p134
aVwe need to do things for this.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe triple aim of healthcare:
p137
aVone, improve patient experience.
p138
aVTwo, improve the population health.
p139
aVThree, decrease per capita expenditure across a continuum.
p140
aVOur group, palliative care,
p141
aVin 2012, working with the sickest of the sick \u2014
p142
aVcancer,
p143
aVheart disease, lung disease,
p144
aVrenal disease,
p145
aVdementia \u2014
p146
aVhow did we improve patient experience?
p147
aa(lp148
V"I want to be at home, Doc."
p149
aa(lp150
V"OK, we'll bring the care to you."
p151
aa(lp152
VQuality of life, enhanced.
p153
aVThink about the human being.
p154
aa(lp155
VTwo: population health.
p156
aVHow did we look at this population differently,
p157
aVand engage with them at a different level, a deeper level,
p158
aVand connect to a broader sense of the human condition than my own?
p159
aVHow do we manage this group,
p160
aVso that of our outpatient population,
p161
aV94 percent, in 2012, never had to go to the hospital?
p162
aVNot because they couldn't.
p163
aVBut they didn't have to.
p164
aVWe brought the care to them.
p165
aVWe maintained their value, their quality.
p166
aa(lp167
VNumber three: per capita expenditures.
p168
aVFor this population,
p169
aVthat today is 2.3 trillion dollars and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,
p170
aVwe reduced health care expenditures by nearly 70 percent.
p171
aVThey got more of what they wanted based on their values,
p172
aVlived better and are living longer,
p173
aVfor two-thirds less money.
p174
aa(lp175
VWhile Harold's time was limited,
p176
aVpalliative care's is not.
p177
aVPalliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis through the end of life.
p178
aVThe hours,
p179
aVweeks, months, years,
p180
aVacross a continuum \u2014
p181
aVwith treatment, without treatment.
p182
aa(lp183
VMeet Christine.
p184
aVStage III cervical cancer,
p185
aVso, metastatic cancer that started in her cervix,
p186
aVspread throughout her body.
p187
aVShe's in her 50s and she is living.
p188
aVThis is not about end of life,
p189
aVthis is about life.
p190
aVThis is not just about the elderly,
p191
aVthis is about people.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis is Richard.
p194
aVEnd-stage lung disease.
p195
aa(lp196
V"Richard, what is it that you hold sacred?"
p197
aa(lp198
V"My kids, my wife and my Harley."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
V"Alright!
p203
aVI can't drive you around on it because I can barely pedal a bicycle,
p204
aVbut let's see what we can do."
p205
aa(lp206
VRichard came to me,
p207
aVand he was in rough shape.
p208
aVHe had this little voice telling him
p209
aVthat maybe his time was weeks to months.
p210
aVAnd then we just talked.
p211
aVAnd I listened and tried to hear \u2014
p212
aVbig difference.
p213
aVUse these in proportion to this.
p214
aa(lp215
VI said, "Alright, let's take it one day at a time,"
p216
aVlike we do in every other chapter of our life.
p217
aVAnd we have met Richard where Richard's at day-to-day.
p218
aVAnd it's a phone call or two a week,
p219
aVbut he's thriving in the context of end-stage lung disease.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, palliative medicine is not just for the elderly,
p222
aVit is not just for the middle-aged.
p223
aVIt is for everyone.
p224
aa(lp225
VMeet my friend Jonathan.
p226
aVWe have the honor and pleasure
p227
aVof Jonathan and his father joining us here today.
p228
aVJonathan is in his 20s, and I met him several years ago.
p229
aVHe was dealing with metastatic testicular cancer,
p230
aVspread to his brain.
p231
aVHe had a stroke,
p232
aVhe had brain surgery,
p233
aVradiation, chemotherapy.
p234
aVUpon meeting him and his family,
p235
aVhe was a couple of weeks away from a bone marrow transplant,
p236
aVand in listening and engaging,
p237
aVthey said, "Help us understand \u2014 what is cancer?"
p238
aa(lp239
VHow did we get this far
p240
aVwithout understanding what we're dealing with?
p241
aVHow did we get this far without empowering somebody
p242
aVto know what it is they're dealing with,
p243
aVand then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings
p244
aVto know if that is what we should do?
p245
aVLord knows we can do any kind of thing to you.
p246
aVBut should we?
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd don't take my word for it.
p249
aVAll the evidence that is related to palliative care these days
p250
aVdemonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer.
p251
aVThere was a seminal article out of the New England Journal of Medicine
p252
aVin 2010.
p253
aVA study done at Harvard by friends of mine, colleagues.
p254
aVEnd-stage lung cancer:
p255
aVone group with palliative care,
p256
aVa similar group without.
p257
aVThe group with palliative care reported less pain,
p258
aVless depression.
p259
aVThey needed fewer hospitalizations.
p260
aVAnd, ladies and gentlemen,
p261
aVthey lived three to six months longer.
p262
aVIf palliative care were a cancer drug,
p263
aVevery cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it.
p264
aVWhy don't they?
p265
aVAgain, because we goofy, long white-coat physicians
p266
aVare trained and of the mantra of dealing with this,
p267
aVnot with this.
p268
aa(lp269
VThis is a space that we will all come to at some point.
p270
aVBut this conversation today is not about dying,
p271
aVit is about living.
p272
aVLiving based on our values,
p273
aVwhat we find sacred
p274
aVand how we want to write the chapters of our lives,
p275
aVwhether it's the last
p276
aVor the last five.
p277
aVWhat we know,
p278
aVwhat we have proven,
p279
aVis that this conversation needs to happen today \u2014
p280
aVnot next week, not next year.
p281
aVWhat is at stake is our lives today
p282
aVand the lives of us as we get older
p283
aVand the lives of our children and our grandchildren.
p284
aVNot just in that hospital room
p285
aVor on the couch at home,
p286
aVbut everywhere we go and everything we see.
p287
aVPalliative medicine is the answer to engage with human beings,
p288
aVto change the journey that we will all face,
p289
aVand change it for the better.
p290
aa(lp291
VTo my colleagues,
p292
aVto my patients,
p293
aVto my government,
p294
aVto all human beings,
p295
aVI ask that we stand and we shout and we demand
p296
aVthe best care possible,
p297
aVso that we can live better today
p298
aVand ensure a better life tomorrow.
p299
aVWe need to shift today
p300
aVso that we can live tomorrow.
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much.
