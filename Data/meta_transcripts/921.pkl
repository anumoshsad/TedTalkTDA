VUp until now, our communication with machines
p4
aVhas always been limited
p5
aVto conscious and direct forms.
p6
aVWhether it's something simple
p7
aVlike turning on the lights with a switch,
p8
aVor even as complex as programming robotics,
p9
aVwe have always had to give a command to a machine,
p10
aVor even a series of commands,
p11
aVin order for it to do something for us.
p12
aVCommunication between people, on the other hand,
p13
aVis far more complex and a lot more interesting
p14
aVbecause we take into account
p15
aVso much more than what is explicitly expressed.
p16
aVWe observe facial expressions, body language,
p17
aVand we can intuit feelings and emotions
p18
aVfrom our dialogue with one another.
p19
aVThis actually forms a large part
p20
aVof our decision-making process.
p21
aVOur vision is to introduce
p22
aVthis whole new realm of human interaction
p23
aVinto human-computer interaction
p24
aVso that computers can understand
p25
aVnot only what you direct it to do,
p26
aVbut it can also respond
p27
aVto your facial expressions
p28
aVand emotional experiences.
p29
aVAnd what better way to do this
p30
aVthan by interpreting the signals
p31
aVnaturally produced by our brain,
p32
aVour center for control and experience.
p33
aa(lp34
VWell, it sounds like a pretty good idea,
p35
aVbut this task, as Bruno mentioned,
p36
aVisn't an easy one for two main reasons:
p37
aVFirst, the detection algorithms.
p38
aVOur brain is made up of
p39
aVbillions of active neurons,
p40
aVaround 170,000 km
p41
aVof combined axon length.
p42
aVWhen these neurons interact,
p43
aVthe chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,
p44
aVwhich can be measured.
p45
aVThe majority of our functional brain
p46
aVis distributed over
p47
aVthe outer surface layer of the brain,
p48
aVand to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,
p49
aVthe brain surface is highly folded.
p50
aVNow this cortical folding
p51
aVpresents a significant challenge
p52
aVfor interpreting surface electrical impulses.
p53
aVEach individual's cortex
p54
aVis folded differently,
p55
aVvery much like a fingerprint.
p56
aVSo even though a signal
p57
aVmay come from the same functional part of the brain,
p58
aVby the time the structure has been folded,
p59
aVits physical location
p60
aVis very different between individuals,
p61
aVeven identical twins.
p62
aVThere is no longer any consistency
p63
aVin the surface signals.
p64
aa(lp65
VOur breakthrough was to create an algorithm
p66
aVthat unfolds the cortex,
p67
aVso that we can map the signals
p68
aVcloser to its source,
p69
aVand therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
p70
aVThe second challenge
p71
aVis the actual device for observing brainwaves.
p72
aVEEG measurements typically involve
p73
aVa hairnet with an array of sensors,
p74
aVlike the one that you can see here in the photo.
p75
aVA technician will put the electrodes
p76
aVonto the scalp
p77
aVusing a conductive gel or paste
p78
aVand usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp
p79
aVby light abrasion.
p80
aVNow this is quite time consuming
p81
aVand isn't the most comfortable process.
p82
aVAnd on top of that, these systems
p83
aVactually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo with that, I'd like to invite onstage
p86
aVEvan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,
p87
aVwho's kindly agreed
p88
aVto help me to demonstrate
p89
aVwhat we've been able to develop.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo the device that you see
p94
aVis a 14-channel, high-fidelity
p95
aVEEG acquisition system.
p96
aVIt doesn't require any scalp preparation,
p97
aVno conductive gel or paste.
p98
aVIt only takes a few minutes to put on
p99
aVand for the signals to settle.
p100
aVIt's also wireless,
p101
aVso it gives you the freedom to move around.
p102
aVAnd compared to the tens of thousands of dollars
p103
aVfor a traditional EEG system,
p104
aVthis headset only costs
p105
aVa few hundred dollars.
p106
aVNow on to the detection algorithms.
p107
aVSo facial expressions \u2014
p108
aVas I mentioned before in emotional experiences \u2014
p109
aVare actually designed to work out of the box
p110
aVwith some sensitivity adjustments
p111
aVavailable for personalization.
p112
aVBut with the limited time we have available,
p113
aVI'd like to show you the cognitive suite,
p114
aVwhich is the ability for you
p115
aVto basically move virtual objects with your mind.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, Evan is new to this system,
p118
aVso what we have to do first
p119
aVis create a new profile for him.
p120
aVHe's obviously not Joanne \u2014 so we'll "add user."
p121
aVEvan. Okay.
p122
aVSo the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite
p123
aVis to start with training
p124
aVa neutral signal.
p125
aVWith neutral, there's nothing in particular
p126
aVthat Evan needs to do.
p127
aVHe just hangs out. He's relaxed.
p128
aVAnd the idea is to establish a baseline
p129
aVor normal state for his brain,
p130
aVbecause every brain is different.
p131
aVIt takes eight seconds to do this,
p132
aVand now that that's done,
p133
aVwe can choose a movement-based action.
p134
aVSo Evan, choose something
p135
aVthat you can visualize clearly in your mind.
p136
aa(lp137
VEvan Grant: Let's do "pull."
p138
aa(lp139
VTan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull."
p140
aVSo the idea here now
p141
aVis that Evan needs to
p142
aVimagine the object coming forward
p143
aVinto the screen,
p144
aVand there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen
p145
aVwhile he's doing that.
p146
aVThe first time, nothing will happen,
p147
aVbecause the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."
p148
aVBut maintain that thought
p149
aVfor the entire duration of the eight seconds.
p150
aVSo: one, two, three, go.
p151
aVOkay.
p152
aVSo once we accept this,
p153
aVthe cube is live.
p154
aVSo let's see if Evan
p155
aVcan actually try and imagine pulling.
p156
aVAh, good job!
p157
aV(Applause)
p158
aVThat's really amazing.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo we have a little bit of time available,
p163
aVso I'm going to ask Evan
p164
aVto do a really difficult task.
p165
aVAnd this one is difficult
p166
aVbecause it's all about being able to visualize something
p167
aVthat doesn't exist in our physical world.
p168
aVThis is "disappear."
p169
aVSo what you want to do \u2014 at least with movement-based actions,
p170
aVwe do that all the time, so you can visualize it.
p171
aVBut with "disappear," there's really no analogies \u2014
p172
aVso Evan, what you want to do here
p173
aVis to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.
p174
aVSame sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.
p175
aVOkay. Let's try that.
p176
aVOh, my goodness. He's just too good.
p177
aVLet's try that again.
p178
aa(lp179
VEG: Losing concentration.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VTL: But we can see that it actually works,
p184
aVeven though you can only hold it
p185
aVfor a little bit of time.
p186
aVAs I said, it's a very difficult process
p187
aVto imagine this.
p188
aVAnd the great thing about it is that
p189
aVwe've only given the software one instance
p190
aVof how he thinks about "disappear."
p191
aVAs there is a machine learning algorithm in this \u2014
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VThank you.
p196
aVGood job. Good job.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful
p201
aVexample of the technology.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo, as you can see, before,
p204
aVthere is a leveling system built into this software
p205
aVso that as Evan, or any user,
p206
aVbecomes more familiar with the system,
p207
aVthey can continue to add more and more detections,
p208
aVso that the system begins to differentiate
p209
aVbetween different distinct thoughts.
p210
aVAnd once you've trained up the detections,
p211
aVthese thoughts can be assigned or mapped
p212
aVto any computing platform,
p213
aVapplication or device.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo I'd like to show you a few examples,
p216
aVbecause there are many possible applications
p217
aVfor this new interface.
p218
aVIn games and virtual worlds, for example,
p219
aVyour facial expressions
p220
aVcan naturally and intuitively be used
p221
aVto control an avatar or virtual character.
p222
aVObviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic
p223
aVand control the world with your mind.
p224
aVAnd also, colors, lighting,
p225
aVsound and effects
p226
aVcan dynamically respond to your emotional state
p227
aVto heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.
p228
aVAnd moving on to some applications
p229
aVdeveloped by developers and researchers around the world,
p230
aVwith robots and simple machines, for example \u2014
p231
aVin this case, flying a toy helicopter
p232
aVsimply by thinking "lift" with your mind.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe technology can also be applied
p235
aVto real world applications \u2014
p236
aVin this example, a smart home.
p237
aVYou know, from the user interface of the control system
p238
aVto opening curtains
p239
aVor closing curtains.
p240
aVAnd of course, also to the lighting \u2014
p241
aVturning them on
p242
aVor off.
p243
aVAnd finally,
p244
aVto real life-changing applications,
p245
aVsuch as being able to control an electric wheelchair.
p246
aVIn this example,
p247
aVfacial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.
p248
aa(lp249
VMan: Now blink right to go right.
p250
aVNow blink left to turn back left.
p251
aVNow smile to go straight.
p252
aa(lp253
VTL: We really \u2014 Thank you.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VWe are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today,
p258
aVand with the community's input,
p259
aVand also with the involvement of developers
p260
aVand researchers from around the world,
p261
aVwe hope that you can help us to shape
p262
aVwhere the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.
