VI don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out
p4
aVexactly what technology means in my life.
p5
aVI've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
p6
aVShould I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
p7
aVShould I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
p8
aVBut at the other hand, a couple of years ago
p9
aVI gave up all of my possessions,
p10
aVsold all my technology \u2014 except for a bicycle \u2014
p11
aVand rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
p12
aVfuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I've since then tried to keep technology
p17
aVat arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
p18
aVAt the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
p19
aVwhere I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
p20
aVSo I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
p21
aVas it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
p22
aVas it relates to the spiritual.
p23
aVAnd I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
p24
aVAnd one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
p25
aVThis is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
p26
aVIt was the suggested syllabus for dealing with
p27
aVthe Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
p28
aa(lp29
VBefore that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
p30
aVI like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
p31
aVHe says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
p36
aVDanny Hillis actually has an update on that \u2014
p37
aVhe says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VWhich also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
p42
aVBut I was interested in another definition of technology.
p43
aVSomething, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
p44
aVSomething that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
p45
aVI came up with a way of framing the question
p46
aVthat seemed to work for me in my investigations.
p47
aVAnd I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
p48
aVSo this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe question that I came up with was this question:
p51
aVwhat does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
p52
aVdoes it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
p53
aVwhat are its inherent trends and biases?
p54
aVWhat are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
p55
aVthinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
p56
aVAnd the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
p57
aVto look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
p58
aVSo he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
p59
aVAnd I'm applying a similar trick to say,
p60
aVwhat if we looked at the universe in our culture
p61
aVthrough the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
p62
aVObviously, this in an incomplete question,
p63
aVjust as looking at an organism as only a gene
p64
aVis an incomplete way of looking at it.
p65
aVBut it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,
p66
aVif we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
p67
aVAnd I think once we ask that question
p68
aVwe have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
p69
aVif we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
p70
aVI think we come back to life at some point.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
p73
aVAnd like you heard from the previous speakers,
p74
aVwe don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
p75
aVWe have really no idea.
p76
aVCraig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt
p77
aVto DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
p78
aVBrian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try
p79
aVand actually discover all the species on Earth.
p80
aVAnd one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
p81
aVand randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
p82
aVjust to see what's on life. And if we did that
p83
aVwith our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
p84
aVwe would begin to see some incredible species.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis is not on another planet. These are things
p87
aVthat are hidden away on our planet.
p88
aVThis is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
p89
aVEach one of these organisms that we've described \u2014 that you've seen
p90
aVfrom Jamie and others, these magnificent things \u2014
p91
aVwhat they're doing, each one of them,
p92
aVis they're hacking the rules of life.
p93
aVI can't think of a single general principle of biology
p94
aVthat does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
p95
aVEvery single thing that we can think of \u2014
p96
aVand if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,
p97
aVyou'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
p98
aVbecause every single one of them is hacking something about it.
p99
aVThis is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
p100
aVthat has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
p101
aVThis is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
p102
aVand the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
p103
aVswallowed the acid, has not yet taken in
p104
aVthe brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
p105
aa(lp106
VThese are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
p107
aVof the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
p108
aVsix kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,
p109
aVthe animals, the fungi, the protests \u2014 the little things \u2014 the bacteria
p110
aVand the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
p111
aVThose are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut a more interesting way,
p114
aVthe current way to take the long view,
p115
aVis to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
p116
aVAnd here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
p117
aVgo over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
p118
aVSo in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
p119
aVof all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
p120
aVYou see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
p121
aVBut what I like about this is it shows that
p122
aVevery living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
p123
aVThose fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
p124
aVThey've been around just as long and gone through
p125
aVjust the same kind of trial and error to get here.
p126
aVBut we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
p127
aVand has a different way of finding out how to do life.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,
p130
aVwhat does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
p131
aVOne of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
p132
aVhave we ever been where we don't find life.
p133
aVWe find life at the bottom of every long-term,
p134
aVlong-distance drilling core into the center of rock
p135
aVthat we bring up \u2014 and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
p136
aVAnd wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
p137
aVMore and more of the inert matter of the globe
p138
aVis being touched and animated by life.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
p141
aVWe see the movement from a general-purpose cell
p142
aVto the more specific and specialized.
p143
aVAnd we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
p144
aVAnd actually, we have current data that does show
p145
aVthat there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
p146
aVAnd the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
p147
aVOne of the things we see about life is that it moves
p148
aVfrom the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
p149
aVthat there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
p150
aVLike those chloroplast cells \u2014
p151
aVthey're completely surrounded by other life.
p152
aVThey never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
p153
aVAnd so the general, long-term trends of evolution
p154
aVare roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,
p155
aVcomplexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
p156
aVOK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd again, my question is, what does technology want?
p159
aVAnd so, remarkably, I discovered
p160
aVthat there's also a drift toward specialization.
p161
aVThat we see there's a general hammer,
p162
aVand hammers become more and more specific over time.
p163
aVThere's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
p164
aVThis is all the contents of a Japanese home.
p165
aVI actually had my daughter \u2014 gave her a tally counter,
p166
aVand I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
p167
aVand count the number of species of technology in our household.
p168
aVAnd it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
p169
aVI did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
p170
aVhad only about 7,000 items in his household.
p171
aVAnd he was the King of England,
p172
aVand that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
p173
aVSo we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
p174
aa(lp175
VThis is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out
p176
aVand he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
p177
aVWell, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
p178
aVAnd the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
p179
aVMost machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
p180
aVand not non-technology, or even life.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex
p183
aVis at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,
p184
aVI was partly responsible for that cliche
p185
aVthat machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
p186
aVSo the major trends in technology evolution actually
p187
aVare the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
p188
aVtowards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,
p189
aVtowards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
p190
aVbecause if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
p191
aVyou can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
p192
aVI suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
p193
aVThat its operations and how it works is so similar
p194
aVthat we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
p195
aVAnd so it would be sort of approximately up there,
p196
aVcoming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
p197
aVwe would find out \u2014 we could actually approach technology in this way.
p198
aa(lp199
VThis is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould
p200
aVof the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
p201
aVBut as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
p202
aVHe has one of the world's largest collections \u2014 about 500 of them.
p203
aVAnd he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
p204
aVand to do a morphological analysis,
p205
aVand try to derive their genealogical history over time.
p206
aVThis is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
p207
aVBut the most interesting aspect about this
p208
aVis that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,
p209
aVthose indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet
p210
aVthat was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
p211
aVWhen something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
p212
aVBut that does happen in technology. And it turns out
p213
aVthat that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,
p214
aVand you can actually use it to determine
p215
aVthat this is a technological system versus a biological system.
p216
aa(lp217
VIn fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important
p218
aVthat I began to think about what happens with old technology.
p219
aVAnd it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
p220
aVSo I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
p221
aV"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
p222
aVThey're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.
p223
aVIn fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
p224
aVAnd this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts
p225
aVfor the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked
p226
aVis sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter) \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
Vfor buying steam valves. I mean, it was just \u2014 it was really there.
p231
aVAnd so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
p232
aVMaybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog
p235
aVand I randomly went through it. And I took a page \u2014 not quite a random page \u2014
p236
aVI took a page that was actually more difficult than others
p237
aVbecause lots of the pages are filled with things
p238
aVthat are still being made. But I took this page
p239
aVand I said, how many of these things are still being made?
p240
aVAnd not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
p241
aVAnd the answer is: all of them.
p242
aVAll of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
p243
aVI don't know who needs a corn sheller.
p244
aVBe it corn shellers \u2014 you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;
p245
aVall these things \u2014 and these are not, again, antiques. These are \u2014
p246
aVyou can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
p247
aVbrand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
p248
aVIn fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
p249
aVmade exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
p250
aVIt's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
p251
aVwhat's important is that this information actually never died out.
p252
aVIt's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
p253
aVAnd in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes
p254
aVuntil two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
p255
aa(lp256
VEven when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
p257
aVSo we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
p258
aVWe've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
p259
aVWe've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
p260
aVtook what I could find, the examples in history
p261
aVwhere there have been prohibitions against technology,
p262
aVand then I tried to find out when they came back in,
p263
aVbecause they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
p264
aVthe duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
p265
aVis decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
p266
aVbut you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
p267
aVwhat culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
p268
aVThat's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
p269
aVAnd when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
p270
aVand add it to what the long-term trajectory \u2014 again, in life's evolution \u2014
p271
aVwe find that each case \u2014 each of the major transitions in life \u2014
p272
aVwhat they're really about is accelerating and changing
p273
aVthe way in which evolution happens.
p274
aVThey're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,
p277
aVthe evolution of evolvability.
p278
aVSo what's happening over time in life is
p279
aVthat the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
p280
aVare increasing. And the real tricks are ways
p281
aVin which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
p282
aVAnd then what we see in the singularity,
p283
aVthat prophesized by Kurzweil and others \u2014
p284
aVhis idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
p285
aVIt's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
p286
aVSo if you have life hacking \u2014
p287
aVlife means hacking, the game of survival \u2014
p288
aVthen evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
p289
aVAnd what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
p290
aVThat is what we call an "infinite game."
p291
aVThat's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,
p292
aVand an infinite game is played to keep playing.
p293
aVAnd I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
p294
aa(lp295
VThe origins of technology was not in 1829,
p296
aVbut was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
p297
aVand at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
p298
aVwere compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
p299
aVand it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
p300
aVThat's the definition. There was no temperature.
p301
aVThere was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
p302
aVwhat it expanded was the potential for difference.
p303
aVSo as it expands and as things expand what we have
p304
aVis the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,
p305
aVopportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
p306
aVThose are all basically the same thing.
p307
aVAnd those are the things that technology brings us.
p308
aVThat's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
p309
aVThat's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
p310
aVAnd so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
p311
aVAnd that's why we continue to grab technology \u2014
p312
aVbecause we want those things. Those things are good.
p313
aVDifferences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
p314
aVAnd each time we make a new opportunity place,
p315
aVwe're allowing a platform to make new ones.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine
p318
aVMozart before the technology of the piano was invented \u2014
p319
aVwhat a loss to society there would be.
p320
aVImagine Van Gogh being born
p321
aVbefore the technologies of cheap oil paints.
p322
aVImagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
p323
aVSomewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born
p324
aVwhose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
p325
aVWe have a moral obligation to invent technology
p326
aVso that every person on the globe has the potential
p327
aVto realize their true difference.
p328
aVWe want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
p329
aVThat's what technology really wants.
p330
aa(lp331
VI'm going to skip through some of the objections
p332
aVbecause I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
p333
aVI don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
p334
aVbad technologies. I don't have an answer to
p335
aVhow this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that
p336
aVmaybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,
p337
aVmaybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
p338
aVMaybe in some ways
p339
aVthe fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
p340
aVIt's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
p341
aVbut it's a really good thing to use
p342
aVto eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
p343
aa(lp344
VOur humanity is actually defined by technology.
p345
aVAll the things that we think that we really like about humanity
p346
aVis being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
p347
aVThat's what we're talking about.
p348
aVYou see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
p349
aVIt's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
p350
aVAnd it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
p351
aVThat's what technology wants.
p352
aVAnd so when I think about what technology wants,
p353
aVI think that it has to do with the fact that every person here \u2014 and I really believe this \u2014
p354
aVevery person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
p355
aVto spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
p356
aVThat recursive nature is the infinite game.
p357
aVAnd if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,
p358
aVso even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
p359
aVThat is the infinite game. And what technology is
p360
aVis the medium in which we play that infinite game.
p361
aVAnd so I think that we should embrace technology
p362
aVbecause it is an essential part of our journey
p363
aVin finding out who we are.
