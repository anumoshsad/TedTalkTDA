V"Look at me!"
p4
aa(lp5
VThat phrase turned me into an eye-contact coach.
p6
aVI'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.
p7
aVIvan has autism,
p8
aVhe doesn't speak,
p9
aVand he communicates through an iPad,
p10
aVwhere his whole universe of words exists in images.
p11
aa(lp12
VHe was diagnosed when he was two and a half.
p13
aVI still remember that day painfully.
p14
aVMy husband and I felt really lost;
p15
aVwe didn't know where to begin.
p16
aVThere was no internet,
p17
aVyou couldn't Google information,
p18
aVso we made those first steps
p19
aVout of sheer intuition.
p20
aa(lp21
VIvan would not maintain eye contact,
p22
aVhe had lost the words that he did know,
p23
aVand he didn't respond to his name or to anything we asked him,
p24
aVas if words were noise.
p25
aVThe only way I could know
p26
aVwhat was going on with him,
p27
aVwhat he felt,
p28
aVwas looking him in the eye.
p29
aVBut that bridge was broken.
p30
aa(lp31
VHow could I teach him about life?
p32
aVWhen I did things he liked, he would look at me,
p33
aVand we were connected.
p34
aVSo I dedicated myself to working with him on those things,
p35
aVso we would have more and more eye-contact moments.
p36
aVWe would spend hours and hours playing tag with his older sister, Alexia,
p37
aVand when we said: "I caught you!"
p38
aVhe would look around for us,
p39
aVand at that moment, I could feel he was alive.
p40
aa(lp41
VWe also hold a record for hours spent in a swimming pool.
p42
aVIvan always had a passion for water.
p43
aVI remember when he was two and a half,
p44
aVon a rainy winter day,
p45
aVI was taking him to an indoor pool,
p46
aVbecause even on rainy days we'd go swimming.
p47
aVWe were on the highway, and I took the wrong exit.
p48
aVHe burst into tears and cried inconsolably, nonstop,
p49
aVuntil I turned back.
p50
aVOnly then did he calm down.
p51
aa(lp52
VHow was it possible that a two and a half year old
p53
aVdidn't respond to his own name,
p54
aVyet in the middle of the rain and fog, where I couldn't see anything,
p55
aVhe knew the exact route?
p56
aVThat's when I realized that Ivan had an exceptional visual memory,
p57
aVand that that would be my way in.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I started taking pictures of everything,
p60
aVand teaching him what life was like,
p61
aVshowing it to him, picture by picture.
p62
aVEven now, it's the way Ivan communicates
p63
aVwhat he wants,
p64
aVwhat he needs
p65
aVand also what he feels.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut it wasn't just Ivan's eye contact that mattered.
p68
aVEveryone else's did, too.
p69
aVHow could I make people see not only his autism,
p70
aVbut see him the person
p71
aVand everything he can give;
p72
aVeverything he can do;
p73
aVthe things he likes and doesn't like,
p74
aVjust like any one of us?
p75
aVBut for that, I also had to give of myself.
p76
aVI had to have the strength to let him go,
p77
aVwhich was extremely difficult.
p78
aa(lp79
VIvan was 11 years old,
p80
aVand he went for treatment in a neighborhood near our house.
p81
aVOne afternoon, while I was waiting for him,
p82
aVI went into a greengrocer,
p83
aVa typical neighborhood store with a little bit of everything.
p84
aVWhile doing the shopping,
p85
aVI started talking to Jose, the owner.
p86
aVI told him about Ivan,
p87
aVthat he had autism,
p88
aVand that I wanted him to learn to walk down the street by himself,
p89
aVwithout anyone holding his hand.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I decided to ask Jose if Thursdays around 2pm,
p92
aVIvan could come and help him arrange the water bottles on the shelves,
p93
aVbecause he loved to organize things.
p94
aVAnd as a reward, he could buy some chocolate cookies,
p95
aVwhich were his favorite.
p96
aVHe said "yes" right away.
p97
aVSo that's how it went for a year:
p98
aVIvan would go to Jose's greengrocer,
p99
aVhelp him arrange the shelves of water bottles
p100
aVwith the labels perfectly lined up on the same side,
p101
aVand he would leave happy with his chocolate cookies.
p102
aa(lp103
VJose is not an expert in autism.
p104
aVThere is no need to be an expert
p105
aVnor do anything heroic to include someone.
p106
aVWe just need to be there \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Applause)
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause ends)
p111
aa(lp112
VReally, no heroic deed \u2014
p113
aVwe simply need to be close.
p114
aVAnd if we are afraid of something
p115
aVor we don't understand something,
p116
aVwe need to ask.
p117
aa(lp118
VLet's be curious
p119
aVbut never indifferent.
p120
aVLet's have the courage to look each other in the eye,
p121
aVbecause by looking,
p122
aVwe can open a whole world to someone else.
