VWhat I want to talk to you about today is
p4
aVvirtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
p5
aVWhat does this all mean for us?
p6
aVWhat it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
p7
aVIt's going to become super exciting as we transform
p8
aVto this highly immersive and interactive world.
p9
aVWith graphics, computing power, low latencies,
p10
aVthese types of applications and possibilities
p11
aVare going to stream rich data into your lives.
p12
aVSo the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,
p13
aVare all about extending our current search metaphor.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,
p16
aVremembering URLs, saving favorites.
p17
aVAs we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,
p18
aVthe Web matching, the index crawling.
p19
aVBut we want to use our brain!
p20
aVWe want to navigate, explore, discover information.
p21
aVIn order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.
p22
aVWe need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo what better way to put you back in the driver's seat
p25
aVthan to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?
p26
aVWhy not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
p27
aVSo Virtual Earth is about starting off
p28
aVcreating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
p29
aVWhat we want to do is mix in all types of data.
p30
aVTag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,
p31
aVglobal perspective, local knowledge.
p32
aVSo when you think about this problem,
p33
aVwhat an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?
p34
aVWell, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,
p35
aVfrom ground vehicles, from people.
p36
aVThis process is an engineering problem,
p37
aVa mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.
p38
aa(lp39
VHere is an example of our aerial camera.
p40
aVThis is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.
p41
aVIn addition, it's multi-spectral.
p42
aVWe collect four gigabits per second of data,
p43
aVif you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
p44
aVThat's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.
p45
aVWe fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
p46
aVYou can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,
p47
aVvantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.
p48
aa(lp49
VWe sit here \u2014 you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale \u2014
p50
aVwhat do you see in person? We need to capture that up close
p51
aVto establish that what it's like-type experience.
p52
aVI bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,
p53
aVkind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.
p54
aVSo a little unknown secret is \u2014
p55
aVdid you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
p56
aVThe poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.
p57
aVWell, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
p58
aV(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.
p59
aVBut let me tell you \u2014 it doesn't affect his day job.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe think a lot of good can come from this technology.
p62
aVThis was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes
p63
aVto be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
p64
aVWe flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,
p65
aVdisaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
p66
aVOften the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.
p67
aVWe made it all freely available on the Web, just to \u2014
p68
aVit was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhen we think about how all this comes together,
p71
aVit's all about software, algorithms and math.
p72
aVYou know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models
p73
aVwe need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.
p74
aVWe have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.
p75
aVExtract geometry from the images.
p76
aVThis process is a very calculated process.
p77
aVIn fact, it was always done manual.
p78
aVHollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor
p79
aVfor a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
p80
aVThey'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
p81
aVThey'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.
p82
aVWe do this all through software, algorithms and math \u2014
p83
aVa highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
p84
aVWe took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,
p85
aVand that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe think about the user interface.
p88
aVWhat does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
p89
aVAn ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery
p90
aVwhile maintaining the fluidity of the model?
p91
aVI'll wrap up by showing you the \u2014
p92
aVthis is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.
p93
aVWhat we're doing is \u2014 people like this a lot,
p94
aVthis bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.
p95
aVBut what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.
p96
aVA child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.
p99
aVYou can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.
p100
aVI can get the next image. I can blend and transition.
p101
aVBy doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
p102
aVThe freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
p103
aVI can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhat we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
p106
aVWe hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,
p107
aVand really derive insights from you, from all different directions.
p108
aVI thank you very much for your time.
