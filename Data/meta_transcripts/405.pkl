VWhat technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?
p4
aVAnd what I found was quite surprising.
p5
aVWe started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,
p6
aVand how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.
p7
aVYou'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,
p8
aVbut it's actually the opposite.
p9
aVAnd so very simple things \u2014 off-the-shelf technologies
p10
aVthat we could easily find on the then-early Web \u2014
p11
aVwould clearly make a huge difference to that problem.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut I also, in looking at more powerful technologies
p14
aVand nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging
p15
aVkind of digital technologies, became very concerned
p16
aVabout the potential for abuse.
p17
aVIf you think about it, in history, a long, long time ago
p18
aVwe dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.
p19
aVWe came up with something \u2014 the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.
p20
aVThat's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.
p21
aVWe organized into cities. We had many people.
p22
aVAnd to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,
p23
aVwe came up with concepts like individual liberty.
p24
aVAnd then, to have to deal with large groups,
p25
aVsay, at the nation-state level,
p26
aVand we had to have mutual non-aggression,
p27
aVor through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to
p28
aVa rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut now we have a new situation, really what people call
p31
aVan asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful
p32
aVthat it extends beyond a nation-state.
p33
aVIt's not the nation-states that have potential access
p34
aVto mass destruction, but individuals.
p35
aVAnd this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.
p36
aVWe saw genome sequences.
p37
aVYou can download the gene sequences
p38
aVof pathogens off the Internet if you want to,
p39
aVand clearly someone recently \u2014 I saw in a science magazine \u2014
p40
aVthey said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
p41
aVIf people want to use it in their labs for working on research,
p42
aVjust reconstruct it yourself,
p43
aVbecause, you know, it might break in FedEx.
p44
aVSo that this is possible to do this is not deniable.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these
p47
aVkinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biological
p48
aVor other, are clearly a danger in our world.
p49
aVAnd the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.
p50
aVAnd we really don't have experience with pandemics,
p51
aVand we're also not very good as a society at acting
p52
aVto things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.
p53
aVSo it's not in our nature to pre-act.
p54
aVAnd in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,
p55
aVbecause it only super-empowers people more.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einstein
p58
aVand others imagine in a conversation that existed
p59
aVin a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,
p60
aVthat the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.
p61
aVYou know, public policy and moral progress.
p62
aVThe bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.
p63
aVWe get our individual rights by society protecting us from others
p64
aVnot doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.
p65
aVAnd so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit,
p66
aVultimately, the ability of individuals
p67
aVto have access, essentially, to pandemic power.
p68
aVWe also have to have sensible defense, because no limitation
p69
aVis going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.
p70
aVAnd you know, and the troubling thing is that
p71
aVit's much easier to do something bad than to defend
p72
aVagainst all possible bad things,
p73
aVso the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000,
p76
aVand my friends told me I was getting really depressed,
p77
aVand they were really worried about me.
p78
aVAnd then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this
p79
aVand moved into a hotel room in New York
p80
aVwith one room full of books on the Plague,
p81
aVand you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York
p82
aVwhere I would be within the circle, and so on.
p83
aVAnd then I was there on September 11th,
p84
aVand I stood in the streets with everyone.
p85
aVAnd it was quite an experience to be there.
p86
aVI got up the next morning and walked out of the city,
p87
aVand all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street
p88
aVand ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.
p89
aVAnd I walked down the middle, up to the train station,
p90
aVand everything below 14th Street was closed.
p91
aVIt was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,
p92
aVa surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.
p93
aVIt was always a surprise that it happened then and there,
p94
aVbut it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd everyone then started writing about this.
p97
aVThousands of people started writing about this.
p98
aVAnd I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me
p99
aVto talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore
p100
aVbecause, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.
p101
aVBut I agreed to come and say a few things about this.
p102
aVAnd I would say that we can't give up the rule of law
p103
aVto fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing
p104
aVbecause of the present, the people that are in power,
p105
aVbecause that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.
p106
aVAnd we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,
p107
aVbecause a million-dollar act
p108
aVcauses a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar response
p109
aVwhich is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,
p110
aVhas made the problem worse.
p111
aVSo we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,
p112
aVone-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo after giving up on the book \u2014 and I had the great honor
p115
aVto be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago,
p116
aVand to work through venture capital on the innovative side,
p117
aVand to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as
p118
aVsome of these big problems.
p119
aVThings where, you know, a factor of 10 difference
p120
aVcan make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.
p121
aVI've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality
p122
aVand excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.
p123
aVIt's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia
p124
aVso I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about
p125
aVwho come through the doors.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut I wanted to share with you three areas
p128
aVthat I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems
p129
aVthat I was talking about in the Wired article.
p130
aVThe first is this whole area of education,
p131
aVand it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.
p132
aVAnd that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.
p133
aVThe most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,
p134
aVand we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest
p135
aVin, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law
p136
aVall the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.
p137
aVAnother factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,
p138
aVwhich should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement
p139
aVin what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,
p140
aVif something costs about 1,000 dollars today,
p141
aVsay, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,
p142
aVI think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?
p143
aVNow, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020
p144
aVas a tool for education.
p145
aa(lp146
VI think the challenge for us is \u2014
p147
aVI'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,
p148
aVwill we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net
p149
aVto let us take advantage of that device?
p150
aVI'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,
p151
aVbut we don't have very good software for them.
p152
aVAnd it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,
p153
aVand you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,
p154
aVGod, the machine was that fast?
p155
aVI remember when they took the Apple Mac interface
p156
aVand they put it back on the Apple II.
p157
aVThe Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,
p158
aVwe just didn't know how to do it at the time.
p159
aVSo given that we know and should believe \u2014
p160
aVbecause Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,
p161
aVI mean, it's just been very predictable progress
p162
aVover the last 40 years or whatever.
p163
aVWe can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.
p164
aVIt's great that we have initiatives to say,
p165
aVlet's go create the education and educate people in the world,
p166
aVbecause that's a great force for peace.
p167
aVAnd we can give everyone in the world a $100 computer
p168
aVor a $10 computer in the next 15 years.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem,
p171
aVbecause that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world.
p172
aVWe'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.
p173
aVThe thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend
p174
aVthat's driving improvement in our ability to address
p175
aVthe environmental problem is new materials.
p176
aVWe have a challenge, because the urban population is growing
p177
aVin this century from two billion to six billion
p178
aVin a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.
p179
aVThey all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,
p180
aVand we want them to develop in a green way.
p181
aVWe're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.
p182
aVWe've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,
p183
aVbut the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.
p184
aVBut these new materials bring such incredible innovations
p185
aVthat there's a strong basis for hope that these things
p186
aVwill be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd I want to give you a specific example of a new material
p189
aVthat was discovered 15 years ago.
p190
aVIf we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991,
p191
aVthey just have incredible properties.
p192
aVAnd these are the kinds of things we're going to discover
p193
aVas we start to engineer at the nano scale.
p194
aVTheir strength: they're almost the strongest material,
p195
aVtensile strength material known.
p196
aVThey're very, very stiff. They stretch very, very little.
p197
aVIn two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them,
p198
aVthey're 30 times stronger than Kevlar.
p199
aVAnd if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball,
p200
aVthey have all sorts of incredible properties.
p201
aVIf you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,
p202
aVthey repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole
p203
aVin femtoseconds, which is not \u2014 is really quick.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVIf you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.
p206
aVIn fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.
p207
aVIf you put electricity on them, they emit light.
p208
aVIf you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more current
p209
aVthrough one of these than through a piece of metal.
p210
aVYou can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,
p211
aVwhich means you can make transistors out of them.
p212
aVThey conduct heat along their length but not across \u2014
p213
aVwell, there is no width, but not in the other direction
p214
aVif you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
p215
aVIf you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip \u2014
p216
aVthey're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.
p217
aVThe inside of the nanotubes is so small \u2014
p218
aVthe smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers \u2014
p219
aVthat it's basically a quantum world.
p220
aVIt's a strange place inside a nanotube.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already,
p223
aVwhere the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.
p224
aVI had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about
p225
aVWitten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand
p226
aVwhat the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.
p227
aVSo inside of a nanotube, we're really at the limit here.
p228
aVSo what we see is with these and other new materials
p229
aVthat we can do things with different properties \u2014 lighter, stronger \u2014
p230
aVand apply these new materials to the environmental problems.
p231
aVNew materials that can make water,
p232
aVnew materials that can make fuel cells work better,
p233
aVnew materials that catalyze chemical reactions,
p234
aVthat cut pollution and so on.
p235
aVEthanol \u2014 new ways of making ethanol.
p236
aVNew ways of making electric transportation.
p237
aVThe whole green dream \u2014 because it can be profitable.
p238
aVAnd we've dedicated \u2014 we've just raised a new fund,
p239
aVwe dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments.
p240
aVWe believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun,
p241
aVthe Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields
p242
aVare yet to be found, because this materials revolution
p243
aVwill drive these things forward.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe third area that we're working on,
p246
aVand we just announced last week \u2014 we were all in New York.
p247
aVWe raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund
p248
aVto work on a pandemic in biodefense.
p249
aVAnd to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised
p250
aVwas a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund.
p251
aVAnd what we did, over the last few months \u2014 well, a few months ago,
p252
aVRay Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times
p253
aVabout how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous.
p254
aVAnd John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear],
p255
aVand we started looking around at what the world was doing
p256
aVabout being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things
p259
aVthat will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,
p260
aVhe said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,
p261
aVbecause there's so many great technologies out there,
p262
aVwe're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.
p263
aVWe have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling
p264
aVthat still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
p265
aVBut Tamiflu \u2014 the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.
p266
aVWe've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well
p267
aVso that the viral resistance \u2014 we need several anti-virals.
p268
aVWe need better surveillance.
p269
aVWe need networks that can find out what's going on.
p270
aVWe need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has
p271
aVa strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.
p272
aVWe've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.
p273
aVWe need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.
p274
aVVaccines that are broad spectrum.
p275
aVVaccines that we can manufacture quickly.
p276
aVCocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
p277
aVYou normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.
p278
aVWe need \u2014 we don't know where this thing is going.
p279
aVWe believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,
p280
aVwe have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic.
p281
aVAnd the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic
p282
aVis about a factor of 1,000 in deaths
p283
aVand certainly enormous economic impact.
p284
aVSo we're very excited because we think we can fund 10,
p285
aVor speed up 10 projects and see them come to market
p286
aVin the next couple years that will address this.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo if we can address, use technology, help address education,
p289
aVhelp address the environment, help address the pandemic,
p290
aVdoes that solve the larger problem that I was talking about
p291
aVin the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,
p292
aVbecause you can't solve a problem with the management of technology
p293
aVwith more technology.
p294
aVIf we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will \u2014
p295
aVa very small number of people will be able to abuse it.
p296
aVWe can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.
p297
aVSo what we need to do is, we need better policy.
p298
aVAnd for example, some things we could do
p299
aVthat would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now
p300
aVbut perhaps with the change of administration would be \u2014 use markets.
p301
aa(lp302
VMarkets are a very strong force.
p303
aVFor example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,
p304
aVwhich probably won't work, if we could price
p305
aVinto the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,
p306
aVso that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe
p307
aVwould have to take insurance against that risk.
p308
aVSo if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.
p309
aVBut it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators;
p310
aVyou'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe.
p311
aVAnd if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly,
p312
aVyou can use a more powerful force, a market force,
p313
aVto provide feedback.
p314
aVHow could you keep the law?
p315
aVI think the law would be a really good thing to keep.
p316
aVWell, you have to hold people accountable.
p317
aVThe law requires accountability.
p318
aVToday scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineers
p319
aVdon't have any personal responsibility
p320
aVfor the consequences of their actions.
p321
aVSo if you tie that \u2014 you have to tie that back with the law.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd finally, I think we have to do something that's not really \u2014
p324
aVit's almost unacceptable to say this \u2014 which,
p325
aVwe have to begin to design the future.
p326
aVWe can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.
p327
aVOur investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu
p328
aVis affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.
p329
aVWe may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood
p330
aVthat it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
p331
aVSo we can design the future if we choose what kind of things
p332
aVwe want to have happen and not have happen,
p333
aVand steer us to a lower-risk place.
p334
aVVice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory
p335
aVinto a lower probability of catastrophic risk.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys,
p338
aVthe people on the defensive side,
p339
aVhave an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.
p340
aVAnd what we have to do to do that
p341
aVis we have to limit access to certain information.
p342
aVAnd growing up as we have, and holding very high
p343
aVthe value of free speech, this is a hard thing for us to accept \u2014
p344
aVfor all of us to accept.
p345
aVIt's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember,
p346
aVyou know, Galileo essentially locked up,
p347
aVand who are still fighting this battle against the church.
p348
aVBut that's the price of having a civilization.
p349
aVThe price of retaining the rule of law
p350
aVis to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power.
p351
