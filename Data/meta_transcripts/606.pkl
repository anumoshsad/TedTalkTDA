VHello! My name is Golan Levin.
p4
aVI'm an artist and an engineer,
p5
aVwhich is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.
p6
aVBut I still fall into this weird crack
p7
aVwhere people don't seem to understand me.
p8
aVAnd I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.
p9
aVIt's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967
p10
aVsaying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue
p11
aVon electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.
p12
aVAnd lest you think that you all, as the digerati, are more enlightened,
p13
aVI went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day.
p14
aVWhere's art? I got productivity. I got sports.
p15
aVAnd somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone,
p16
aVwhich my friends and I are doing now,
p17
aVis still not reflected in our understanding
p18
aVof what computers are for.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding
p21
aVabout what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials
p22
aVof his own day, or her own day,
p23
aVwhich I think artists are obliged to do,
p24
aVis to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.
p25
aVIn my own case, I'm an artist,
p26
aVand I'm really interested in
p27
aVexpanding the vocabulary of human action,
p28
aVand basically empowering people through interactivity.
p29
aVI want people to discover themselves as actors,
p30
aVas creative actors, by having interactive experiences.
p31
aa(lp32
VA lot of my work is about trying to get away from this.
p33
aVThis a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine.
p34
aVAnd when I say desktop, I don't just mean
p35
aVthe actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk.
p36
aVIf you look carefully, you can even see
p37
aVa hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left,
p38
aVwhere the virtual world has literally
p39
aVpunched through to the physical.
p40
aVSo this is, as Joy Mountford once said,
p41
aV"The mouse is probably the narrowest straw
p42
aVyou could try to suck all of human expression through."
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich
p47
aVkinds of interactive experiences.
p48
aVHow can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies
p49
aVas a way of exploring aesthetic experiences,
p50
aVnot necessarily utilitarian ones.
p51
aVSo I write software. And that's how I do it.
p52
aVAnd a lot of my experiences
p53
aVresemble mirrors in some way.
p54
aVBecause this is, in some sense, the first way,
p55
aVthat people discover their own potential as actors,
p56
aVand discover their own agency.
p57
aVBy saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me."
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so, to give an example,
p60
aVthis is a project from last year,
p61
aVwhich is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor.
p62
aVAnd it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create
p63
aVwhen they're just going about their everyday business.
p64
aVSo as people make shapes with their hands or their heads
p65
aVand so forth, or with each other,
p66
aVthese shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air \u2014
p67
aVbasically taking what's often this, kind of, unseen space,
p68
aVor this undetected space, and making it something real,
p69
aVthat people then can appreciate and become creative with.
p70
aVSo again, people discover their creative agency in this way.
p71
aVAnd their own personalities come out
p72
aVin totally unique ways.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo in addition to using full-body input,
p75
aVsomething that I've explored now, for a while,
p76
aVhas been the use of the voice,
p77
aVwhich is an immensely expressive system for us, vocalizing.
p78
aVSong is one of our oldest ways
p79
aVof making ourselves heard and understood.
p80
aVAnd I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler,
p81
aVthe so-called father of gestalt psychology, from 1927,
p82
aVwho submitted to an audience like yourselves
p83
aVthe following two shapes.
p84
aVAnd he said one of them is called Maluma.
p85
aVAnd one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?
p86
aVAnyone want to hazard a guess?
p87
aVMaluma is on top. Yeah. So.
p88
aVAs he says here, most people answer without any hesitation.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon
p91
aVcalled phonaesthesia,
p92
aVwhich is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.
p93
aVAnd so, whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about
p94
aVhow perhaps one person in a million
p95
aVactually has true synesthesia,
p96
aVwhere they hear colors or taste shapes, and things like this,
p97
aVphonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent.
p98
aVIt's about mappings between different perceptual domains,
p99
aVlike hardness, sharpness, brightness and darkness,
p100
aVand the phonemes that we're able to speak with.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo 70 years on, there's been some research where
p103
aVcognitive psychologists have actually sussed out
p104
aVthe extent to which, you know,
p105
aVL, M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this,
p106
aVand P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this.
p107
aVAnd here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature
p108
aVthat we can exploit numerically,
p109
aVa relative mapping between curvature and shape.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo it occurred to me, what happens if we could run these backwards?
p112
aVAnd thus was born the project called Remark,
p113
aVwhich is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman
p114
aVand the Ars Electronica Futurelab.
p115
aVAnd this is an interactive installation which presents
p116
aVthe fiction that speech casts visible shadows.
p117
aVSo the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light.
p118
aVAnd as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.
p119
aVAnd they sort of fly away, out of your head.
p120
aVIf a computer speech recognition system
p121
aVis able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.
p122
aVAnd if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically
p123
aVtightly coupled to the sounds you made.
p124
aVSo let's bring up a video of that.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VThanks. So. And this project here,
p129
aVI was working with the great abstract vocalist, Jaap Blonk.
p130
aVAnd he is a world expert in performing "The Ursonate,"
p131
aVwhich is a half-an-hour nonsense poem
p132
aVby Kurt Schwitters, written in the 1920s,
p133
aVwhich is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense.
p134
aVAnd it's almost impossible to perform.
p135
aVBut Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it.
p136
aVAnd in this project we've developed
p137
aVa form of intelligent real-time subtitles.
p138
aVSo these are our live subtitles,
p139
aVthat are being produced by a computer that knows the text of "The Ursonate" \u2014
p140
aVfortunately Jaap does too, very well \u2014
p141
aVand it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is.
p142
aVSo all the text you're going to see
p143
aVis real-time generated by the computer,
p144
aVvisualizing what he's doing with his voice.
p145
aVHere you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him.
p146
aVOkay. So ...
p147
aV(Applause)
p148
aVThe full videos are online if you are interested.
p149
aa(lp150
VI got a split reaction to that during the live performance,
p151
aVbecause there is some people who understand
p152
aVlive subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron,
p153
aVbecause usually there is someone making them afterwards.
p154
aVAnd then a bunch of people who were like, "What's the big deal?
p155
aVI see subtitles all the time on television."
p156
aVYou know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo in addition to the full body, and in addition to the voice,
p159
aVanother thing that I've been really interested in,
p160
aVmost recently, is the use of the eyes,
p161
aVor the gaze, in terms of how people relate to each other.
p162
aVIt's a really profound amount of nonverbal information
p163
aVthat's communicated with the eyes.
p164
aVAnd it's one of the most interesting technical challenges
p165
aVthat's very currently active in the computer sciences:
p166
aVbeing able to have a camera that can understand,
p167
aVfrom a fairly big distance away,
p168
aVhow these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another
p169
aVto reveal what you're interested in,
p170
aVand where your attention is directed.
p171
aVSo there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects,
p174
aVto understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.
p175
aVAnd basically to ask the questions:
p176
aVWhat if art was aware that we were looking at it?
p177
aVHow could it respond, in a way,
p178
aVto acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?
p179
aVAnd what could it do if it could look back at us?
p180
aVAnd so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects.
p181
aa(lp182
VIn the first one which I'm going to show you, called Eyecode,
p183
aVit's a piece of interactive software
p184
aVin which, if we read this little circle,
p185
aV"the trace left by the looking of the previous observer
p186
aVlooks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer."
p187
aVThe idea is that it's an image wholly constructed
p188
aVfrom its own history of being viewed
p189
aVby different people in an installation.
p190
aVSo let me just switch over so we can do the live demo.
p191
aVSo let's run this and see if it works.
p192
aa(lp193
VOkay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video.
p194
aVThere is just a little test screen that shows that it's working.
p195
aVAnd what I'm just going to do is \u2014 I'm going to hide that.
p196
aVAnd you can see here that what it's doing
p197
aVis it's recording my eyes every time I blink.
p198
aVHello? And I can ... hello ... okay.
p199
aVAnd no matter where I am, what's really going on here
p200
aVis that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes.
p201
aVAnd if I get really far away I'm blurry.
p202
aVYou know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this
p203
aVthat maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way.
p204
aVBut if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera
p205
aVon this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes.
p206
aa(lp207
VYou can think of it as a way of, sort of, typing, with your eyes.
p208
aVAnd what you're typing are recordings of your eyes
p209
aVas you're looking at other peoples' eyes.
p210
aVSo each person is looking at the looking
p211
aVof everyone else before them.
p212
aVAnd this exists in larger installations
p213
aVwhere there are thousands and thousands of eyes
p214
aVthat people could be staring at,
p215
aVas you see who's looking at the people looking
p216
aVat the people looking before them.
p217
aVSo I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.
p218
aVAnd you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes
p219
aVand doing its best to estimate when it's blinking.
p220
aVAlright. Let's leave that.
p221
aVSo that's this kind of recursive observation system.
p222
aV(Applause)
p223
aVThank you.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe last couple pieces I'm going to show
p226
aVare basically in the new realm of robotics \u2014 for me, new for me.
p227
aVIt's called Opto-Isolator.
p228
aVAnd I'm going to show a video of the older version of it,
p229
aVwhich is just a minute long. Okay.
p230
aVIn this case, the Opto-Isolator is blinking
p231
aVin response to one's own blinks.
p232
aVSo it blinks one second after you do.
p233
aVThis is a device which is intended to reduce
p234
aVthe phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials.
p235
aVJust one eye,
p236
aVlooking at you, and eliminating everything else about a face,
p237
aVbut just to consider gaze in an isolated way
p238
aVas a kind of, as an element.
p239
aVAnd at the same time, it attempts to engage in what you might call
p240
aVfamiliar psycho-social gaze behaviors.
p241
aVLike looking away if you look at it too long
p242
aVbecause it gets shy,
p243
aVor things like that.
p244
aa(lp245
VOkay. So the last project I'm going to show
p246
aVis this new one called Snout.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVIt's an eight-foot snout,
p249
aVwith a googly eye.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVAnd inside it's got an 800-pound robot arm
p252
aVthat I borrowed,
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aVfrom a friend.
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aVIt helps to have good friends.
p257
aVI'm at Carnegie Mellon; we've got a great Robotics Institute there.
p258
aVI'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is \u2014
p259
aVThe idea behind this project is to
p260
aVmake a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVThe idea is that basically \u2014
p263
aVif it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?"
p264
aVThat's why its other name is Doubletaker, Taker of Doubles.
p265
aVIt's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"
p266
aVAnd the idea is basically, can it look at you
p267
aVand make you feel as if like,
p268
aV"What? Is it my shoes?"
p269
aV"Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright.
p270
aa(lp271
VChecking him out ...
p272
aVFor you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes.
p273
aVIt's got a computer vision system,
p274
aVand it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most.
p275
aVThose are its targets.
p276
aVUp there is the skeleton,
p277
aVwhich is actually what it's trying to do.
p278
aVIt's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature.
p279
aVHollywood does this all the time, of course.
p280
aVBut also have the body language communicate something
p281
aVto the person who is looking at it.
p282
aVThis language is communicating that it is surprised to see you,
p283
aVand it's interested in looking at you.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you very much. That's all I've got for today.
p290
aVAnd I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much.
