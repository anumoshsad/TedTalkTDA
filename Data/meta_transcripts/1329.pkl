VI'm going to start here.
p4
aVThis is a hand-lettered sign
p5
aVthat appeared in a mom and pop bakery
p6
aVin my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
p7
aVThe store owned one of those machines
p8
aVthat can print on plates of sugar.
p9
aVAnd kids could bring in drawings
p10
aVand have the store print a sugar plate
p11
aVfor the top of their birthday cake.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw
p14
aVwas cartoon characters.
p15
aVThey liked to draw the Little Mermaid,
p16
aVthey'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.
p17
aVBut it turns out to be illegal
p18
aVto print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse
p19
aVonto a plate of sugar.
p20
aVAnd it's a copyright violation.
p21
aVAnd policing copyright violations
p22
aVfor children's birthday cakes
p23
aVwas such a hassle
p24
aVthat the College Bakery said,
p25
aV"You know what, we're getting out of that business.
p26
aVIf you're an amateur,
p27
aVyou don't have access to our machine anymore.
p28
aVIf you want a printed sugar birthday cake,
p29
aVyou have to use one of our prefab images \u2014
p30
aVonly for professionals."
p31
aa(lp32
VSo there's two bills in Congress right now.
p33
aVOne is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.
p34
aVSOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
p35
aVIt's from the Senate.
p36
aVPIPA is short for PROTECTIP,
p37
aVwhich is itself short for
p38
aVPreventing Real Online Threats
p39
aVto Economic Creativity
p40
aVand Theft of Intellectual Property \u2014
p41
aVbecause the congressional aides who name these things
p42
aVhave a lot of time on their hands.
p43
aVAnd what SOPA and PIPA want to do
p44
aVis they want to do this.
p45
aVThey want to raise the cost
p46
aVof copyright compliance
p47
aVto the point where people simply get out of the business
p48
aVof offering it as a capability to amateurs.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow the way they propose to do this
p51
aVis to identify sites
p52
aVthat are substantially infringing on copyright \u2014
p53
aValthough how those sites are identified
p54
aVis never fully specified in the bills \u2014
p55
aVand then they want to remove them from the domain name system.
p56
aVThey want to take them out of the domain name system.
p57
aVNow the domain name system
p58
aVis the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,
p59
aVinto the kinds of addresses
p60
aVmachines expect \u2014
p61
aV74.125.226.212.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow the problem with this model of censorship,
p64
aVof identifying a site
p65
aVand then trying to remove it from the domain name system,
p66
aVis that it won't work.
p67
aVAnd you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,
p68
aVbut Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.
p69
aVNow the reason it won't work
p70
aVis that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser
p71
aVor you can make it a clickable link
p72
aVand you'll still go to Google.
p73
aVSo the policing layer
p74
aVaround the problem
p75
aVbecomes the real threat of the act.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow to understand how Congress came to write a bill
p78
aVthat won't accomplish its stated goals,
p79
aVbut will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,
p80
aVyou have to understand a little bit about the back story.
p81
aVAnd the back story is this:
p82
aVSOPA and PIPA, as legislation,
p83
aVwere drafted largely by media companies
p84
aVthat were founded in the 20th century.
p85
aVThe 20th century was a great time to be a media company,
p86
aVbecause the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
p87
aVIf you were making a TV show,
p88
aVit didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;
p89
aVit only had to be better
p90
aVthan the two other shows
p91
aVthat were on at the same time \u2014
p92
aVwhich is a very low threshold
p93
aVof competitive difficulty.
p94
aVWhich meant
p95
aVthat if you fielded average content,
p96
aVyou got a third of the U.S. public for free \u2014
p97
aVtens of millions of users
p98
aVfor simply doing something
p99
aVthat wasn't too terrible.
p100
aVThis is like having a license to print money
p101
aVand a barrel of free ink.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.
p104
aVAnd slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,
p105
aVthat scarcity started to get eroded \u2014
p106
aVand I don't mean by digital technology;
p107
aVI mean by analog technology.
p108
aVCassette tapes, video cassette recorders,
p109
aVeven the humble Xerox machine
p110
aVcreated new opportunities
p111
aVfor us to behave in ways
p112
aVthat astonished the media business.
p113
aVBecause it turned out
p114
aVwe're not really couch potatoes.
p115
aVWe don't really like to only consume.
p116
aVWe do like to consume,
p117
aVbut every time one of these new tools came along,
p118
aVit turned out we also like to produce
p119
aVand we like to share.
p120
aVAnd this freaked the media businesses out \u2014
p121
aVit freaked them out every time.
p122
aVJack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist
p123
aVfor the Motion Picture Association of America,
p124
aVonce likened the ferocious video cassette recorder
p125
aVto Jack the Ripper
p126
aVand poor, helpless Hollywood
p127
aVto a woman at home alone.
p128
aVThat was the level of rhetoric.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so the media industries
p131
aVbegged, insisted, demanded
p132
aVthat Congress do something.
p133
aVAnd Congress did something.
p134
aVBy the early 90s, Congress passed the law
p135
aVthat changed everything.
p136
aVAnd that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act
p137
aVof 1992.
p138
aVWhat the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,
p139
aVlook, if people are taping stuff off the radio
p140
aVand then making mixtapes for their friends,
p141
aVthat is not a crime. That's okay.
p142
aVTaping and remixing
p143
aVand sharing with your friends is okay.
p144
aVIf you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,
p145
aVthat's not okay.
p146
aVBut this taping business,
p147
aVfine, let it go.
p148
aVAnd they thought that they clarified the issue,
p149
aVbecause they'd set out a clear distinction
p150
aVbetween legal and illegal copying.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.
p153
aVThey had wanted Congress
p154
aVto outlaw copying full-stop.
p155
aVSo when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,
p156
aVthe media businesses gave up on the idea
p157
aVof legal versus illegal distinctions for copying
p158
aVbecause it was clear
p159
aVthat if Congress was acting in their framework,
p160
aVthey might actually increase the rights of citizens
p161
aVto participate in our own media environment.
p162
aVSo they went for plan B.
p163
aVIt took them a while to formulate plan B.
p164
aa(lp165
VPlan B appeared in its first full-blown form
p166
aVin 1998 \u2014
p167
aVsomething called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
p168
aVIt was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.
p169
aVBut the main thrust of the DMCA
p170
aVwas that it was legal to sell you
p171
aVuncopyable digital material \u2014
p172
aVexcept that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.
p173
aVIt would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,
p174
aV"Like handing out water
p175
aVthat wasn't wet."
p176
aVBits are copyable. That's what computers do.
p177
aVThat is a side effect of their ordinary operation.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo in order to fake the ability
p180
aVto sell uncopyable bits,
p181
aVthe DMCA also made it legal
p182
aVto force you to use systems
p183
aVthat broke the copying function of your devices.
p184
aVEvery DVD player and game player
p185
aVand television and computer you brought home \u2014
p186
aVno matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it \u2014
p187
aVcould be broken by the content industries,
p188
aVif they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.
p189
aVAnd to make sure you didn't realize,
p190
aVor didn't enact their capabilities
p191
aVas general purpose computing devices,
p192
aVthey also made it illegal
p193
aVfor you to try to reset
p194
aVthe copyability of that content.
p195
aVThe DMCA marks the moment
p196
aVwhen the media industries
p197
aVgave up on the legal system
p198
aVof distinguishing between legal and illegal copying
p199
aVand simply tried to prevent copying
p200
aVthrough technical means.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,
p203
aVbut in this one domain, limiting sharing,
p204
aVit has mostly not worked.
p205
aVAnd the main reason it hasn't worked
p206
aVis the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful
p207
aVthan anyone imagined.
p208
aVThe mixtape, the fanzine,
p209
aVthat was nothing compared to what we're seeing now
p210
aVwith the Internet.
p211
aVWe are in a world
p212
aVwhere most American citizens
p213
aVover the age of 12
p214
aVshare things with each other online.
p215
aVWe share written things, we share images,
p216
aVwe share audio, we share video.
p217
aVSome of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.
p218
aVSome of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.
p219
aVSome of the stuff we share
p220
aVis stuff we've made out of what we've found,
p221
aVand all of it horrifies those industries.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo PIPA and SOPA
p224
aVare round two.
p225
aVBut where the DMCA was surgical \u2014
p226
aVwe want to go down into your computer,
p227
aVwe want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,
p228
aVand prevent it from doing
p229
aVwhat they said it would do at the store \u2014
p230
aVPIPA and SOPA are nuclear
p231
aVand they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world
p232
aVand censor content.
p233
aVNow the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,
p234
aVis you need to take out anybody
p235
aVpointing to those IP addresses.
p236
aVYou need to take them out of search engines,
p237
aVyou need to take them out of online directories,
p238
aVyou need to take them out of user lists.
p239
aVAnd because the biggest producers of content on the Internet
p240
aVare not Google and Yahoo,
p241
aVthey're us,
p242
aVwe're the people getting policed.
p243
aVBecause in the end,
p244
aVthe real threat
p245
aVto the enactment of PIPA and SOPA
p246
aVis our ability to share things with one another.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo what PIPA and SOPA risk doing
p249
aVis taking a centuries-old legal concept,
p250
aVinnocent until proven guilty,
p251
aVand reversing it \u2014
p252
aVguilty until proven innocent.
p253
aVYou can't share
p254
aVuntil you show us
p255
aVthat you're not sharing something
p256
aVwe don't like.
p257
aVSuddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal
p258
aVfalls affirmatively on us
p259
aVand on the services
p260
aVthat might be offering us any new capabilities.
p261
aVAnd if it costs even a dime
p262
aVto police a user,
p263
aVthat will crush a service
p264
aVwith a hundred million users.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo this is the Internet they have in mind.
p267
aVImagine this sign everywhere \u2014
p268
aVexcept imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,
p269
aVimagine it says YouTube
p270
aVand Facebook and Twitter.
p271
aVImagine it says TED,
p272
aVbecause the comments can't be policed
p273
aVat any acceptable cost.
p274
aVThe real effects of SOPA and PIPA
p275
aVare going to be different than the proposed effects.
p276
aVThe threat, in fact,
p277
aVis this inversion of the burden of proof,
p278
aVwhere we suddenly
p279
aVare all treated like thieves
p280
aVat every moment we're given the freedom to create,
p281
aVto produce or to share.
p282
aVAnd the people who provide those capabilities to us \u2014
p283
aVthe YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs \u2014
p284
aVare in the business
p285
aVof having to police us,
p286
aVor being on the hook for contributory infringement.
p287
aa(lp288
VThere's two things you can do
p289
aVto help stop this \u2014
p290
aVa simple thing and a complicated thing,
p291
aVan easy thing and a hard thing.
p292
aVThe simple thing, the easy thing, is this:
p293
aVif you're an American citizen,
p294
aVcall your representative, call your senator.
p295
aVWhen you look at
p296
aVthe people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,
p297
aVpeople who've co-signed on PIPA,
p298
aVwhat you see is that they have cumulatively received
p299
aVmillions and millions of dollars
p300
aVfrom the traditional media industries.
p301
aVYou don't have millions and millions of dollars,
p302
aVbut you can call your representatives,
p303
aVand you can remind them that you vote,
p304
aVand you can ask not to be treated like a thief,
p305
aVand you can suggest that you would prefer
p306
aVthat the Internet not be broken.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd if you're not an American citizen,
p309
aVyou can contact American citizens that you know
p310
aVand encourage them to do the same.
p311
aVBecause this seems like a national issue,
p312
aVbut it is not.
p313
aVThese industries will not be content
p314
aVwith breaking our Internet.
p315
aVIf they break it, they will break it for everybody.
p316
aVThat's the easy thing.
p317
aVThat's the simple thing.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe hard thing is this:
p320
aVget ready, because more is coming.
p321
aVSOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,
p322
aVwhich was purposed last year, which did not pass.
p323
aVAnd all of this goes back
p324
aVto the failure of the DMCA
p325
aVto disallow sharing as a technical means.
p326
aVAnd the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,
p327
aVwhich horrified those industries.
p328
aVBecause the whole business
p329
aVof actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law
p330
aVand then gathering evidence and proving that,
p331
aVthat turns out to be really inconvenient.
p332
aV"We'd prefer not to do that,"
p333
aVsays the content industries.
p334
aVAnd what they want is not to have to do that.
p335
aVThey don't want legal distinctions
p336
aVbetween legal and illegal sharing.
p337
aVThey just want the sharing to go away.
p338
aa(lp339
VPIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,
p340
aVthey're not events.
p341
aVThey're the next turn of this particular screw,
p342
aVwhich has been going on 20 years now.
p343
aVAnd if we defeat these, as I hope we do,
p344
aVmore is coming.
p345
aVBecause until we convince Congress
p346
aVthat the way to deal with copyright violation
p347
aVis the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,
p348
aVwhich is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence
p349
aVand the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies
p350
aVthat goes on in democratic societies.
p351
aVThat's the way to handle this.
p352
aa(lp353
VIn the meantime,
p354
aVthe hard thing to do is to be ready.
p355
aVBecause that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.
p356
aVTime Warner has called
p357
aVand they want us all back on the couch,
p358
aVjust consuming \u2014
p359
aVnot producing, not sharing \u2014
p360
aVand we should say, "No."
p361
