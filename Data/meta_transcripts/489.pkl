VI don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
p4
aVI was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada,
p5
aVand dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone,
p6
aVand I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.
p7
aVBut about three years ago I had an art show in New York,
p8
aVand I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
p9
aVSo I think I'm actually the first one here \u2014 I lead.
p10
aVI called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,
p11
aVI use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration
p12
aVfrom when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it \u2014
p13
aVit's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.
p14
aVAnd meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,
p17
aVand the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor \u2014
p18
aVwhich you can't see there.
p19
aVThis was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J \u2014
p22
aVI'm a bug for authenticity \u2014 in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.
p25
aVYou can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.
p26
aa(lp27
VMy work is so personal and so strange
p28
aVthat I have to invent my own lexicon for it.
p29
aVAnd I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism,"
p30
aVwhich is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.
p31
aVAnd they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.
p32
aVAnd the peak time for that was the 30s,
p33
aVbecause the Depression was so dismal
p34
aVthat anything to get away from the present into the future ...
p35
aVand technology was going to carry us along.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days \u2014
p38
aVI had a huge collection of them from the '30s \u2014
p39
aVall they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses
p40
aVout of wire coat hangers and everything improvised
p41
aVand dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots
p42
aVplaying ice hockey at 300 miles an hour \u2014
p43
aVit's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.
p44
aa(lp45
VAutomotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.
p46
aVI was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter,
p47
aVso I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.
p48
aVDetroit has always been halfway into the future \u2014 the advertising half.
p49
aVThis is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.
p50
aVThis is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.
p51
aVThat's from a whole catalog \u2014 it's 18 pages or so \u2014
p52
aVran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.
p53
aa(lp54
VTechno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened \u2014
p55
aVfor good reason, usually.
p56
aVThe zeppelin \u2014 this was from a brochure about the zeppelin
p57
aVbased, obviously, on the Hindenburg.
p58
aVBut the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.
p59
aVAnd it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark,
p60
aVand it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.
p61
aVSo the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.
p64
aVThe auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,
p65
aVbut it should have \u2014 it wasn't a big success.
p66
aVIt's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
p67
aVYou needed to know that.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe flying car which never got off the ground \u2014 it was a post-war dream.
p70
aVMy old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.
p71
aVThis is pitched into the future from 1946,
p72
aVlooking at the day all American families have them.
p73
aV"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"
p74
aa(lp75
VFaux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of \u2014 not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.
p76
aVIt's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.
p77
aVSomebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion \u2014
p78
aVso I think that\u2019s a case for serious play.
p79
aa(lp80
VThis is emblematic of it \u2014 this is wing dining,
p81
aVrecalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,
p82
aVdining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,
p83
aVbut that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel
p84
aVto Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis is tank polo in the South Hamptons.
p87
aVThe brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.
p90
aVI think it adds a huge amount.
p91
aVThose, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.
p92
aVThey had two machine guns and a cannon,
p93
aVand they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.
p94
aVThey went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.
p95
aVAnd they had a canary hung inside the thing
p96
aVto make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.
p97
aVHappy little story, isn't it?
p98
aa(lp99
VThis is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s,
p100
aVwhere you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.
p101
aVAnybody who was anybody had an apartment there.
p102
aVI managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.
p103
aVAnd I love cigars \u2014 there's a cigar billboard down there.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.
p106
aVThis is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940,
p107
aVwhen a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons
p108
aVand buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.
p109
aVIt's a fond memory of times past.
p110
aa(lp111
VHyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit,
p112
aVjust for the fun of it. This was a piece I did \u2014 a brochure again \u2014
p113
aV"RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
p114
aVThe copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages,
p115
aVsays that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over,
p116
aVand it's so safe it carries no insurance.
p117
aVIt's obviously modeled on the Titanic.
p118
aVBut it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.
p119
aVIt's just a sick, silly joke.
p120
aa(lp121
VShamelessly cheap is something, I think \u2014 this will wake you up.
p122
aVIt has no meaning, just \u2014 Desoto discovers the Mississippi,
p123
aVand it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.
p124
aVI did that as a quick back page \u2014 I had like four hours to do a back page
p125
aVfor an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,
p126
aVand I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."
p127
aVPeople wrote in for reprints of that thing.
p128
aa(lp129
VUrban absurdism \u2014 that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
p130
aVI try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
p131
aVI've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.
p132
aVI was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,
p133
aVand this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that \u2014
p134
aVwho\u2019s to say?
p135
aa(lp136
VThe Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York \u2014 it's a very somber place.
p137
aVI thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.
p140
aVI couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,
p141
aV"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,
p142
aVplease apologize on our website."
p143
aVHaven't got around to it yet but \u2014 I may.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is the word side of my brain.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVI love the word "Eurotrash."
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVThat's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.
p152
aVIf you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.
p153
aVExcept that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff \u2014 they all do \u2014
p154
aVand a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist
p155
aVabout to shoot rockets at the Tour de France \u2014
p156
aVsign of our times, I guess.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is the only fashion cover I've ever done.
p159
aVIt's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing \u2014
p160
aVthe title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."
p161
aVI don't know a hell of a lot about fashion \u2014
p162
aVI was told to do what they call a Mary Jane,
p163
aVand then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying:
p164
aV"Put a strap on it" \u2014 "No, don't put a strap on it" \u2014 "Put a strap on it \u2014 "Don't put a strap on it" \u2014
p165
aVbecause it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and \u2014
p166
aVI finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis is a tiny joke \u2014 E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.
p169
aa(lp170
VThis is a big joke.
p171
aVThis is the audition for "King Kong."
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVPeople always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?
p174
aVTruth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,
p175
aVin the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox \u2014 all I had to do was write it down.
p176
aVIt was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.
p177
aVAnd then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg \u2014
p178
aVif you know that name \u2014 called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.
p179
aVHer former name was Fay Wray, and so that was \u2014
p180
aVI didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."
p181
aa(lp182
VFinally, this was a three-page cover, never done before,
p183
aVand I don't think it will ever be done again \u2014
p184
aVsuccessive pages in the front of the magazine.
p185
aVIt's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
p186
aVYou can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,
p187
aVyou can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.
p188
aV(Applause)
p189
aa(lp190
VPretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.
p191
aVI would just like to add a crass commercial \u2014
p192
aVI have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"
p193
aVa compendium of all the serious play that ever was,
p194
aVand it\u2019s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores,
p195
aVtables on the street in October.
p196
aVSo thank you very much.
