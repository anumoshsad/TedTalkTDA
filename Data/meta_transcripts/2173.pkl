VIt is very fashionable and proper  to speak about food
p4
aVin all its forms, all its colors,  aromas and tastes.
p5
aVBut after the food goes through  the digestive system,
p6
aVwhen it is thrown out as crap,
p7
aVit is no longer fashionable to speak about it.
p8
aVIt is rather revolting.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm a guy who has graduated  from bullshit to full-shit.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVMy organization, Gram Vikas, which means "village development organization,"
p13
aVwas working in the area  of renewable energy.
p14
aVOn the most part, we were  producing biogas,
p15
aVbiogas for rural kitchens.
p16
aVWe produce biogas in India  by using animal manure,
p17
aVwhich usually, in India,  is called cow dung.
p18
aVBut as the gender-sensitive  person that I am,
p19
aVI would like to call it bullshit.
p20
aVBut realizing later on
p21
aVhow important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way,
p22
aVwe went into the arena of sanitation.
p23
aVEighty percent of all diseases  in India and most developing countries
p24
aVare because of poor quality water.
p25
aVAnd when we look at the reason  for poor quality water,
p26
aVyou find that it is our abysmal attitude  to the disposal of human waste.
p27
aa(lp28
VHuman waste, in its rawest form,
p29
aVfinds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water,
p30
aVirrigation water, whatever water you see.
p31
aVAnd this is the cause for 80 percent  of the diseases in rural areas.
p32
aVIn India, it is unfortunately only the women who carry water.
p33
aVSo for all domestic needs, women have to carry water.
p34
aVSo that is a pitiable state of affairs.
p35
aa(lp36
VOpen defecation is rampant.
p37
aVSeventy percent of India defecates in the open.
p38
aVThey sit there out in the open,
p39
aVwith the wind on their sails,
p40
aVhiding their faces, exposing their bases,
p41
aVand sitting there in pristine glory \u2014
p42
aV70 percent of India.
p43
aVAnd if you look at the world total,
p44
aV60 percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians.
p45
aVA fantastic distinction.
p46
aVI don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo we, together with a lot of villages,
p50
aVwe began to talk about how to really  address this situation of sanitation.
p51
aVAnd we came together and formed  a project called MANTRA.
p52
aVMANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.
p53
aVSo we are speaking about transformation, transformation in rural areas.
p54
aVVillages that agree  to implement this project,
p55
aVthey organize a legal society
p56
aVwhere the general body  consists of all members
p57
aVwho elect a group of men and women who implement the project
p58
aVand, later on, who look after the operation and maintenance.
p59
aVThey decide to build a toilet  and a shower room.
p60
aVAnd from a protected water source,
p61
aVwater will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households
p62
aVthrough three taps:
p63
aVone in the toilet, one in the shower,  one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.
p64
aVThe pity is that our cities, like New Delhi and Bombay,
p65
aVdo not have a 24-hour water supply.
p66
aVBut in these villages, we want to have it.
p67
aa(lp68
VThere is a distinct difference  in the quality.
p69
aVWell in India, we have a theory, which is very much accepted
p70
aVby the government bureaucracy and all those who matter,
p71
aVthat poor people deserve poor solutions
p72
aVand absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions.
p73
aVThis, combined with  a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that
p74
aVthe cheapest is the most economic,
p75
aVis the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink.
p76
aVWe are fighting against this.
p77
aVWe feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries.
p78
aVAnd even in sanitation,
p79
aVthey should not be humiliated.
p80
aVSanitation is more about dignity
p81
aVthan about human disposal of waste.
p82
aVAnd so you build these toilets  and very often,
p83
aVwe have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses.
p84
aVAnd you can see that in front are  the attached houses
p85
aVand the others are the toilets.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo these people, without a single exception of a family in a village,
p88
aVdecide to build a toilet, a bathing room.
p89
aVAnd for that, they come together, collect all the local materials \u2014
p90
aVlocal materials like rubble,  sand, aggregates,
p91
aVusually a government subsidy is available
p92
aVto meet at least part of the cost  of external materials
p93
aVlike cement, steel, toilet commode.
p94
aVAnd they build a toilet  and a bathing room.
p95
aVAlso, all the unskilled laborers, that is  daily wage earners, mostly landless,
p96
aVare given an opportunity to be  trained as masons and plumbers.
p97
aVSo while these people are being trained,  others are collecting the materials.
p98
aVAnd when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room,
p99
aVand of course also a water tower,  an elevated water reservoir.
p100
aVWe use a system of two leach pits  to treat the waste.
p101
aVFrom the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.
p102
aVAnd when it is full, it is blocked  and it can go to the next.
p103
aVBut we discovered that if you plant banana trees, papaya trees
p104
aVon the periphery of these leach pits,
p105
aVthey grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients
p106
aVand you get very tasty bananas, papayas.
p107
aVIf any of you come to my place,
p108
aVI would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you.
p109
aVSo there you can see  the completed toilets, the water towers.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is in a village where  most of the people are even illiterate.
p112
aVIt is always a 24-hour water supply
p113
aVbecause water gets polluted very often when you store it \u2014
p114
aVa child dips his or her hand into it, something falls into it.
p115
aVSo no water is stored. It's always on tap.
p116
aVThis is how an elevated  water reservoir is constructed.
p117
aVAnd that is the end product.
p118
aVBecause it has to go high, and there is some space available,
p119
aVtwo or three rooms are made under the water tower,
p120
aVwhich are used by the village for  different committee meetings.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program.
p123
aVBefore we started, there were, as usual,
p124
aVmore than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases.
p125
aVBut after this, we have empirical evidence that 82 percent, on average,
p126
aVamong all these villages \u2014 1,200 villages have completed it \u2014
p127
aVwaterborne diseases  have come down 82 percent.
p128
aV(Applause)
p129
aVWomen usually used to spend,  especially in the summer months,
p130
aVabout six to seven hours  a day carrying water.
p131
aVAnd when they went to carry water,
p132
aVbecause, as I said earlier, it's only women who carry water,
p133
aVthey used to take their little children, girl children, also to carry water,
p134
aVor else to be back at home to look after the siblings.
p135
aVSo there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school,
p136
aVeven if there was a school.
p137
aVAnd boys, about 30 percent.
p138
aVBut girls, it has gone to about 90 percent and boys, almost to 100 percent.
p139
aV(Applause)
p140
aVThe most vulnerable section in a village
p141
aVare the landless laborers who are the daily wage-earners.
p142
aVBecause they have gone  through this training
p143
aVto be masons and plumbers and bar benders,
p144
aVnow their ability to earn has  increased 300 to 400 percent.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo this is a democracy in action
p147
aVbecause there is a general body,  a governing board, the committee.
p148
aVPeople are questioning,  people are governing themselves,
p149
aVpeople are learning to manage their own affairs,
p150
aVthey are taking their own futures into their hands.
p151
aVAnd that is democracy at the grassroots level in action.
p152
aVMore than 1,200 villages  have so far done this.
p153
aVIt benefits over 400,000 people and it's still going on.
p154
aVAnd I hope it continues to move ahead.
p155
aa(lp156
VFor India and such developing countries,
p157
aVarmies and armaments,
p158
aVsoftware companies and spaceships
p159
aVmay not be as important as taps and toilets.
p160
aa(lp161
VThank you. Thank you very much.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Applause)
p164
aVThank you.
