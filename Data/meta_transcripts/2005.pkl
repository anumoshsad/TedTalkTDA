VAs a student of adversity,
p4
aVI've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges
p5
aVseem to draw strength from them.
p6
aVAnd I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning.
p7
aVAnd for a long time,
p8
aVI thought the meaning was out there,
p9
aVsome great truth waiting to be found.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut over time,
p12
aVI've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant.
p13
aVWe call it "finding meaning,"
p14
aVbut we might better call it "forging meaning."
p15
aa(lp16
VMy last book was about how families manage to deal
p17
aVwith various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring.
p18
aVAnd one of the mothers I interviewed,
p19
aVwho had two children with multiple severe disabilities,
p20
aVsaid to me, "People always give us these little sayings like,
p21
aV'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle.'
p22
aVBut children like ours are not preordained as a gift.
p23
aVThey're a gift
p24
aVbecause that's what we have chosen."
p25
aa(lp26
VWe make those choices all our lives.
p27
aVWhen I was in second grade,
p28
aVBobby Finkel had a birthday party
p29
aVand invited everyone in our class but me.
p30
aVMy mother assumed there had been some sort of error,
p31
aVand she called Mrs. Finkel,
p32
aVwho said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party.
p33
aVAnd that day, my mom took me to the zoo
p34
aVand out for a hot fudge sundae.
p35
aVWhen I was in seventh grade,
p36
aVone of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me "Percy,"
p37
aVas a shorthand for my demeanor.
p38
aVAnd sometimes, he and his cohort would chant that provocation
p39
aVthe entire school bus ride,
p40
aV45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:
p41
aV"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"
p42
aVWhen I was in eighth grade, our science teacher told us
p43
aVthat all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence
p44
aVbecause of the trauma to their anal sphincter.
p45
aVAnd I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria,
p46
aVwhere I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so,
p47
aVor sat with the boys,
p48
aVand been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls.
p49
aa(lp50
VI survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance.
p51
aVWhat I didn't know then
p52
aVand do know now,
p53
aVis that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning.
p54
aVAfter you've forged meaning,
p55
aVyou need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity.
p56
aVYou need to take the traumas
p57
aVand make them part of who you've come to be,
p58
aVand you need to fold the worst events of your life
p59
aVinto a narrative of triumph,
p60
aVevincing a better self in response to things that hurt.
p61
aa(lp62
VOne of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book
p63
aVhad been raped as an adolescent,
p64
aVand had a child following that rape,
p65
aVwhich had thrown away her career plans
p66
aVand damaged all of her emotional relationships.
p67
aVBut when I met her, she was 50,
p68
aVand I said to her,
p69
aV"Do you often think about the man who raped you?"
p70
aVAnd she said, "I used to think about him with anger,
p71
aVbut now only with pity."
p72
aVAnd I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved
p73
aVas to have done this terrible thing.
p74
aVAnd I said, "Pity?"
p75
aVAnd she said, "Yes,
p76
aVbecause he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren,
p77
aVand he doesn't know that,
p78
aVand I do.
p79
aVSo as it turns out,
p80
aVI'm the lucky one."
p81
aa(lp82
VSome of our struggles are things we're born to:
p83
aVour gender, our sexuality, our race, our disability.
p84
aVAnd some are things that happen to us:
p85
aVbeing a political prisoner, being a rape victim,
p86
aVbeing a Katrina survivor.
p87
aVIdentity involves entering a community
p88
aVto draw strength from that community,
p89
aVand to give strength there, too.
p90
aVIt involves substituting "and" for "but" \u2014
p91
aVnot "I am here but I have cancer,"
p92
aVbut rather, "I have cancer and I am here."
p93
aa(lp94
VWhen we're ashamed, we can't tell our stories,
p95
aVand stories are the foundation
p96
aVof identity.
p97
aVForge meaning,
p98
aVbuild identity.
p99
aVForge meaning and build identity.
p100
aVThat became my mantra.
p101
aVForging meaning is about changing yourself.
p102
aVBuilding identity is about changing the world.
p103
aVAll of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily:
p104
aVHow much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves,
p105
aVand how much to break the limits
p106
aVof what constitutes a valid life?
p107
aVForging meaning and building identity
p108
aVdoes not make what was wrong right.
p109
aVIt only makes what was wrong precious.
p110
aa(lp111
VIn January of this year,
p112
aVI went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners,
p113
aVand I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated.
p114
aVMost of them had knowingly committed the offenses
p115
aVthat landed them in prison,
p116
aVand they had walked in with their heads held high,
p117
aVand they walked out with their heads still held high,
p118
aVmany years later.
p119
aVDr. Ma Thida, a leading human rights activist
p120
aVwho had nearly died in prison
p121
aVand had spent many years in solitary confinement,
p122
aVtold me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think,
p123
aVfor the wisdom she had gained,
p124
aVfor the chance to hone her meditation skills.
p125
aVShe had sought meaning
p126
aVand made her travail into a crucial identity.
p127
aVBut if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated
p128
aVabout being in prison,
p129
aVthey were also less thrilled than I'd expected
p130
aVabout the reform process going on in their country.
p131
aVMa Thida said,
p132
aV"We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure,
p133
aVbut we also have grievance under glamour."
p134
aVShe said, "And the fact that there have been these shifts and changes
p135
aVdoesn't erase the continuing problems in our society
p136
aVthat we learned to see so well while we were in prison."
p137
aa(lp138
VI understood her to be saying
p139
aVthat concessions confer only a little humanity
p140
aVwhere full humanity is due;
p141
aVthat crumbs are not the same as a place at the table.
p142
aVWhich is to say,
p143
aVyou can forge meaning and build identity
p144
aVand still be mad as hell.
p145
aa(lp146
VI've never been raped,
p147
aVand I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison.
p148
aVBut as a gay American,
p149
aVI've experienced prejudice and even hatred,
p150
aVand I've forged meaning
p151
aVand I've built identity,
p152
aVwhich is a move I learned from people
p153
aVwho had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known.
p154
aVIn my own adolescence,
p155
aVI went to extreme lengths to try to be straight.
p156
aVI enrolled myself in something called "sexual surrogacy therapy,"
p157
aVin which people I was encouraged to call doctors
p158
aVprescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises
p159
aVwith women I was encouraged to call surrogates,
p160
aVwho were not exactly prostitutes
p161
aVbut who were also not exactly anything else.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VMy particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South
p166
aVwho eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac,
p167
aVand had taken this job after she got in trouble
p168
aVdown at the morgue.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VThese experiences eventually allowed me to have
p173
aVsome happy physical relationships with women,
p174
aVfor which I'm grateful.
p175
aVBut I was at war with myself,
p176
aVand I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche.
p177
aa(lp178
VWe don't seek the painful experiences
p179
aVthat hew our identities,
p180
aVbut we seek our identities
p181
aVin the wake of painful experiences.
p182
aVWe cannot bear a pointless torment,
p183
aVbut we can endure great pain
p184
aVif we believe that it's purposeful.
p185
aVEase makes less of an impression on us
p186
aVthan struggle.
p187
aVWe could have been ourselves without our delights,
p188
aVbut not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.
p189
aV"Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities,"
p190
aVSt. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,
p191
aV"for when I am weak, then I am strong."
p192
aa(lp193
VIn 1988, I went to Moscow to interview artists
p194
aVof the Soviet underground.
p195
aVI expected their work to be dissident and political.
p196
aVBut the radicalism in their work
p197
aVactually lay in reinserting humanity into a society
p198
aVthat was annihilating humanity itself,
p199
aVas, in some senses, Russian society is now doing again.
p200
aVOne of the artists I met said to me,
p201
aV"We were in training to be not artists but angels."
p202
aa(lp203
VIn 1991, I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about,
p204
aVand I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union.
p205
aVAnd they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch.
p206
aVAnd on the third day of the putsch,
p207
aVone of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya.
p208
aVAnd we went there,
p209
aVand we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades,
p210
aVand a little while later,
p211
aVa column of tanks rolled up.
p212
aVAnd the soldier on the front tank said,
p213
aV"We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade.
p214
aVIf you get out of the way, we don't need to hurt you.
p215
aVBut if you won't move, we'll have no choice but to run you down."
p216
aVThe artist I was with said, "Give us just a minute.
p217
aVGive us just a minute to tell you why we're here."
p218
aVAnd the soldier folded his arms,
p219
aVand the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy
p220
aVsuch as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy
p221
aVwould be hard-pressed to present.
p222
aVAnd they went on and on,
p223
aVand the soldier watched.
p224
aVAnd then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished
p225
aVand looked at us, so bedraggled in the rain,
p226
aVand said, "What you have said is true,
p227
aVand we must bow to the will of the people.
p228
aVIf you'll clear enough space for us to turn around,
p229
aVwe'll go back the way we came."
p230
aVAnd that's what they did.
p231
aVSometimes, forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need
p232
aVto fight for your ultimate freedom.
p233
aa(lp234
VRussia awakened me to the lemonade notion
p235
aVthat oppression breeds the power to oppose it.
p236
aVAnd I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity.
p237
aVIt took identity to rescue me from sadness.
p238
aVThe gay rights movement posits a world
p239
aVin which my aberrances are a victory.
p240
aVIdentity politics always works on two fronts:
p241
aVto give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic,
p242
aVand to cause the outside world to treat such people
p243
aVmore gently and more kindly.
p244
aVThose are two totally separate enterprises,
p245
aVbut progress in each sphere reverberates in the other.
p246
aVIdentity politics can be narcissistic.
p247
aVPeople extol a difference only because it's theirs.
p248
aVPeople narrow the world and function in discrete groups
p249
aVwithout empathy for one another.
p250
aVBut properly understood and wisely practiced,
p251
aVidentity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human.
p252
aVIdentity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal,
p253
aVbut a revolution.
p254
aa(lp255
VI would have had an easier life if I were straight,
p256
aVbut I would not be me.
p257
aVAnd I now like being myself better
p258
aVthan the idea of being someone else,
p259
aVsomeone who, to be honest,
p260
aVI have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine.
p261
aVBut if you banish the dragons, you banish the heroes,
p262
aVand we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives.
p263
aVI've sometimes wondered
p264
aVwhether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself
p265
aVwithout gay pride's technicolor fiesta,
p266
aVof which this speech is one manifestation.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VI used to think I would know myself to be mature
p271
aVwhen I could simply be gay without emphasis.
p272
aVBut the self-loathing of that period left a void,
p273
aVand celebration needs to fill and overflow it,
p274
aVand even if I repay my private debt of melancholy,
p275
aVthere's still an outer world of homophobia
p276
aVthat it will take decades to address.
p277
aVSomeday, being gay will be a simple fact,
p278
aVfree of party hats and blame.
p279
aVBut not yet.
p280
aVA friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself,
p281
aVonce suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VIt's a great idea.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VBut its time has not yet come.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd neutrality, which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration,
p296
aVis actually the endgame.
p297
aa(lp298
VIn 29 states in the US,
p299
aVI could legally be fired or denied housing
p300
aVfor being gay.
p301
aVIn Russia, the anti-propaganda law
p302
aVhas led to people being beaten in the streets.
p303
aVTwenty-seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy.
p304
aVAnd in Nigeria, gay people can legally be stoned to death,
p305
aVand lynchings have become common.
p306
aVIn Saudi Arabia recently,
p307
aVtwo men who had been caught in carnal acts
p308
aVwere sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,
p309
aVand are now permanently disabled as a result.
p310
aVSo who can forge meaning
p311
aVand build identity?
p312
aVGay rights are not primarily marriage rights,
p313
aVand for the millions who live in unaccepting places
p314
aVwith no resources,
p315
aVdignity remains elusive.
p316
aVI am lucky to have forged meaning
p317
aVand built identity,
p318
aVbut that's still a rare privilege.
p319
aVAnd gay people deserve more, collectively,
p320
aVthan the crumbs of justice.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd yet,
p323
aVevery step forward is so sweet.
p324
aVIn 2007, six years after we met,
p325
aVmy partner and I decided to get married.
p326
aVMeeting John had been the discovery of great happiness
p327
aVand also the elimination of great unhappiness.
p328
aVAnd sometimes, I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain,
p329
aVthat I forgot about the joy,
p330
aVwhich was at first the less remarkable part of it to me.
p331
aVMarrying was a way to declare our love
p332
aVas more a presence than an absence.
p333
aa(lp334
VMarriage soon led us to children,
p335
aVand that meant new meanings
p336
aVand new identities \u2014 ours and theirs.
p337
aVI want my children to be happy,
p338
aVand I love them most achingly when they are sad.
p339
aVAs a gay father, I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives,
p340
aVbut I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity,
p341
aVI will have failed as a parent.
p342
aVA Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me
p343
aVthat Westerners mistakenly think
p344
aVthat nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you,
p345
aVand you have only bliss to look forward to.
p346
aVBut he said that would not be nirvana,
p347
aVbecause your bliss in the present
p348
aVwould always be shadowed by the joy from the past.
p349
aVNirvana, he said, is what you arrive at
p350
aVwhen you have only bliss to look forward to
p351
aVand find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy.
p352
aVAnd I sometimes wonder
p353
aVwhether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children
p354
aVif they'd come more readily,
p355
aVif I'd been straight in my youth or were young now,
p356
aVin either of which cases this might be easier.
p357
aVPerhaps I could.
p358
aVPerhaps all the complex imagining I've done
p359
aVcould have been applied to other topics.
p360
aVBut if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning,
p361
aVthe question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied,
p362
aVbut whether assigning meaning to those experiences
p363
aVhas made me a better father.
p364
aVI tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys,
p365
aVbecause I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me.
p366
aa(lp367
VI know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families,
p368
aVbut gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh,
p369
aVand gay families so exhilaratingly new,
p370
aVand I found meaning in that surprise.
p371
aa(lp372
VIn October, it was my 50th birthday,
p373
aVand my family organized a party for me.
p374
aVAnd in the middle of it, my son said to my husband
p375
aVthat he wanted to make a speech.
p376
aVAnd John said,
p377
aV"George, you can't make a speech. You're four."
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
V"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight."
p382
aVBut George insisted and insisted,
p383
aVand finally, John took him up to the microphone,
p384
aVand George said very loudly,
p385
aV"Ladies and gentlemen!
p386
aVMay I have your attention, please?"
p387
aVAnd everyone turned around, startled.
p388
aVAnd George said,
p389
aV"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.
p390
aVI'm glad we all get cake.
p391
aVAnd Daddy, if you were little,
p392
aVI'd be your friend."
p393
aa(lp394
V(Gasp)
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd I thought \u2014 (Applause)
p397
aVThank you.
p398
aVI thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel,
p399
aVbecause all those earlier experiences
p400
aVwere what had propelled me to this moment,
p401
aVand I was finally unconditionally grateful
p402
aVfor a life I'd once have done anything to change.
p403
aa(lp404
VThe gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man
p405
aVwhat he could do to help the movement,
p406
aVand Harvey Milk said,
p407
aV"Go out and tell someone."
p408
aVThere's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity.
p409
aVAnd there are always stories that restore it.
p410
aVIf we live out loud,
p411
aVwe can trounce the hatred,
p412
aVand expand everyone's lives.
p413
aa(lp414
VForge meaning.
p415
aVBuild identity.
p416
aVForge meaning.
p417
aVBuild identity.
p418
aVAnd then invite the world to share your joy.
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you.
p421

p423
