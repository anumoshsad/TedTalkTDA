VIn the 1600s, there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay
p4
aVoff the east coast of the U.S.
p5
aVthat apparently you could walk across their backs
p6
aVfrom one end of the bay to the other.
p7
aVToday, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered.
p8
aVLike them, many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced
p9
aVby 200 years of whaling,
p10
aVwhere they were hunted and killed for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.
p11
aa(lp12
VWe only have whales in our waters today
p13
aVbecause of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s.
p14
aVIt was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling,
p15
aVand was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales,
p16
aVwhat could we save?
p17
aVIt was ultimately a test of our political ability
p18
aVto halt environmental destruction.
p19
aVSo in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling
p20
aVthat came into force as a result of this campaign.
p21
aVWhales in our waters are still low in numbers, however,
p22
aVbecause they do face a range of other human-induced threats.
p23
aa(lp24
VUnfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself
p25
aVdo what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful.
p26
aVThis is actually a disservice,
p27
aVbecause whales are ecosystem engineers.
p28
aVThey help maintain the stability and health of the oceans,
p29
aVand even provide services to human society.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo let's talk about why saving whales is critical
p32
aVto the resiliency of the oceans.
p33
aVIt boils down to two main things:
p34
aVwhale poop and rotting carcasses.
p35
aa(lp36
VAs whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe,
p37
aVthey actually release these enormous fecal plumes.
p38
aVThis whale pump, as it's called,
p39
aVactually brings essential limiting  nutrients from the depths
p40
aVto the surface waters where they  stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
p41
aVwhich forms the base of all marine food chains.
p42
aVSo really, having more whales in the oceans pooping
p43
aVis really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhales are also known to undertake some  of the longest migrations of all mammals.
p46
aVGray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers
p47
aVbetween productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas
p48
aVand back every year.
p49
aVAs they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces
p50
aVfrom places that have it to places that need it.
p51
aVSo clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling,
p52
aVboth horizontally and vertically, through the oceans.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut what's really cool is that they're  also really important after they're dead.
p55
aVWhale carcasses are some of  the largest form of detritus
p56
aVto fall from the ocean's surface,  and they're called whale fall.
p57
aVAs these carcasses sink,
p58
aVthey provide a feast to some 400-odd species,
p59
aVincluding the eel-shaped, slime-producing  hagfish.
p60
aVSo over the 200 years of whaling,
p61
aVwhen we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans,
p62
aVwe likely altered the rate and geographic  distribution of these whale falls
p63
aVthat would descend into deep oceans,
p64
aVand as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions
p65
aVof species that were most specialized
p66
aVand dependent on these carcasses for their survival.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,
p69
aVwhich is the equivalent of that produced
p70
aVby 80,000 cars per year
p71
aVfrom the atmosphere to the deep oceans,
p72
aVand the deep oceans are what we call "carbon sinks,"
p73
aVbecause they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere,
p74
aVand therefore help to delay global warming.
p75
aVSometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches
p76
aVand provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental
p79
aVand caused a reduction in the populations of whales
p80
aVbetween 60 to 90 percent.
p81
aVClearly, the Save the Whales movement
p82
aVwas instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on,
p83
aVbut we need to revise this.
p84
aVWe need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face
p85
aVin our waters today.
p86
aVAmongst other things, we need to stop them
p87
aVfrom getting plowed down by container  ships when they're in their feeding areas,
p88
aVand stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets
p89
aVas they float around in the ocean.
p90
aVWe also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages,
p91
aVso people really understand the true  ecosystem value of these creatures.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, let's save the whales again,
p94
aVbut this time, let's not just  do it for their sake.
p95
aVLet's also do it for ours.
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you.
