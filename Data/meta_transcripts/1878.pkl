VSo yesterday, I was out in the street
p4
aVin front of this building,
p5
aVand I was walking down the sidewalk,
p6
aVand I had company, several of us,
p7
aVand we were all abiding by the rules
p8
aVof walking down sidewalks.
p9
aVWe're not talking each other. We're facing forward.
p10
aVWe're moving.
p11
aVWhen the person in front of me slows down.
p12
aVAnd so I'm watching him, and he slows down,
p13
aVand finally he stops.
p14
aVWell, that wasn't fast enough for me,
p15
aVso I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,
p16
aVand as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,
p17
aVand he was doing this.
p18
aVHe was texting,
p19
aVand he couldn't text and walk at the same time.
p20
aVNow we could approach this
p21
aVfrom a working memory perspective
p22
aVor from a multitasking perspective.
p23
aVWe're going to do working memory today.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, working memory
p26
aVis that part of our consciousness that we are
p27
aVaware of at any given time of day.
p28
aVYou're going it right now.
p29
aVIt's not something we can turn off.
p30
aVIf you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?
p31
aVSo right now, you're doing just fine.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow working memory has four basic components.
p34
aVIt allows us to store some immediate experiences
p35
aVand a little bit of knowledge.
p36
aVIt allows us to reach back into our long-term memory
p37
aVand pull some of that in as we need it,
p38
aVmixes it, processes it
p39
aVin light of whatever our current goal is.
p40
aVNow the current goal isn't something like,
p41
aVI want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
p42
aVIt's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,
p43
aVor I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
p44
aVNow working memory capacity
p45
aVis our ability to leverage that,
p46
aVour ability to take what we know
p47
aVand what we can hang onto
p48
aVand leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy
p49
aVour current goal.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow working memory capacity
p52
aVhas a fairly long history,
p53
aVand it's associated with a lot of positive effects.
p54
aVPeople with high working memory capacity
p55
aVtend to be good storytellers.
p56
aVThey tend to solve and do well on standardized tests,
p57
aVhowever important that is.
p58
aVThey're able to have high levels of writing ability.
p59
aVThey're also able to reason at high levels.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that.
p62
aVSo I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,
p63
aVand we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride.
p64
aVYou up for that? Okay.
p65
aa(lp66
VI'm going to give you five words,
p67
aVand I just want you to hang on to them.
p68
aVDon't write them down. Just hang on to them.
p69
aVFive words.
p70
aVWhile you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.
p71
aVI want to see what happens with those words.
p72
aVSo here's the words:
p73
aVtree,
p74
aVhighway,
p75
aVmirror,
p76
aVSaturn
p77
aVand electrode.
p78
aVSo far so good?
p79
aVOkay. What I want you to do
p80
aVis I want you to tell me what the answer is
p81
aVto 23 times eight.
p82
aVJust shout it out.
p83
aV(Mumbling) (Laughter)
p84
aVIn fact it's \u2014 (Mumbling) \u2014 exactly. (Laughter)
p85
aVAll right. I want you to take out your left hand
p86
aVand I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,
p87
aVsix, seven, eight, nine, 10."
p88
aVIt's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering.
p89
aVAll right, now what I want you to do
p90
aVis to recite the last five letters
p91
aVof the English alphabet backwards.
p92
aVYou should have started with Z.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAll right. How many people here are still pretty sure
p96
aVyou've got all five words?
p97
aVOkay. Typically we end up with about less than half,
p98
aVright, which is normal. There will be a range.
p99
aVSome people can hang on to five.
p100
aVSome people can hang on to 10.
p101
aVSome will be down to two or three.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhat we know is this is really important to the way we function, right?
p104
aVAnd it's going to be really important here at TED
p105
aVbecause you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow the problem that we have
p108
aVis that life comes at us,
p109
aVand it comes at us very quickly,
p110
aVand what we need to do is to take that amorphous
p111
aVflow of experience and somehow
p112
aVextract meaning from it
p113
aVwith a working memory
p114
aVthat's about the size of a pea.
p115
aVNow don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome.
p116
aVWorking memory allows us
p117
aVto investigate our current experience
p118
aVas we move forward.
p119
aVIt allows us to make sense of the world around us.
p120
aVBut it does have certain limits.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.
p123
aVWe can have a conversation,
p124
aVand I can build a narrative around that
p125
aVso I know where we've been and where we're going
p126
aVand how to contribute to this conversation.
p127
aVIt allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
p128
aVWe can be in the middle of a meeting,
p129
aVlisten to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,
p130
aVdecide whether or not we like it,
p131
aVask follow-up questions.
p132
aVAll of that occurs within working memory.
p133
aVIt also allows us to go to the store
p134
aVand allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese
p135
aVwhen what we're really looking for
p136
aVis Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)
p137
aVGotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.
p138
aVNow, a central issue with working memory
p139
aVis that it's limited.
p140
aVIt's limited in capacity, limited in duration,
p141
aVlimited in focus.
p142
aVWe tend to remember about four things.
p143
aVOkay? It used to be seven,
p144
aVbut with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,
p145
aVand we were overachieving.
p146
aVNow we can remember those four things
p147
aVfor about 10 to 20 seconds
p148
aVunless we do something with it,
p149
aVunless we process it, unless we apply it to something,
p150
aVunless we talk to somebody about it.
p151
aa(lp152
VWhen we think about working memory,
p153
aVwe have to realize that this limited capacity
p154
aVhas lots of different impacts on us.
p155
aVHave you ever walked from one room to another
p156
aVand then forgotten why you're there?
p157
aVYou do know the solution to that, right?
p158
aVYou go back to that original room. (Laughter)
p159
aVHave you ever forgotten your keys?
p160
aVYou ever forgotten your car?
p161
aVYou ever forgotten your kids?
p162
aVHave you ever been involved in a conversation,
p163
aVand you realize that the conversation to your left
p164
aVis actually more interesting? (Laughter)
p165
aVSo you're nodding and you're smiling,
p166
aVbut you're really paying attention to this one over here,
p167
aVuntil you hear that last word go up,
p168
aVand you realize,
p169
aVyou've been asked a question. (Laughter)
p170
aVAnd you're really hoping the answer is no,
p171
aVbecause that's what you're about to say.
p172
aVAll of that talks about working memory,
p173
aVwhat we can do and what we can't do.
p174
aVWe need to realize that working memory
p175
aVhas a limited capacity,
p176
aVand that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that.
p177
aVWe negotiate that through strategies.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here,
p180
aVand these will be really important
p181
aVbecause you are now in an information target-rich environment
p182
aVfor the next several days.
p183
aVNow the first part of this that we need to think about
p184
aVand we need to process our existence, our life,
p185
aVimmediately and repeatedly.
p186
aVWe need to process what's going on
p187
aVthe moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,
p188
aVnot a week later, at the moment.
p189
aVSo we need to think about, well, do I agree with him?
p190
aVWhat's missing? What would I like to know?
p191
aVDo I agree with the assumptions?
p192
aVHow can I apply this in my life?
p193
aVIt's a way of processing what's going on
p194
aVso that we can use it later.
p195
aVNow we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.
p196
aVSo we need to think about it here.
p197
aVIn between, we want to talk to people about it.
p198
aVWe're going to write it down, and when you get home,
p199
aVpull out those notes and think about them
p200
aVand end up practicing over time.
p201
aVPractice for some reason became a very negative thing.
p202
aVIt's very positive.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe next thing is, we need to think elaboratively
p205
aVand we need to think illustratively.
p206
aVOftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge.
p207
aVWhat we want to do is spin that around.
p208
aVWe want to take all of our existence
p209
aVand wrap it around that new knowledge
p210
aVand make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful.
p211
aVWe also want to use imagery. We are built for images.
p212
aVWe need to take advantage of that.
p213
aVThink about things in images,
p214
aVwrite things down that way.
p215
aVIf you read a book, pull things up.
p216
aVI just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"
p217
aVand I have a perfect idea of what he looks like
p218
aVin my head, so my own version.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe last one is organization and support.
p221
aVWe are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.
p222
aVWe try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us.
p223
aVOrganization helps, so we need to structure
p224
aVwhat we're doing in ways that make sense.
p225
aVIf we are providing knowledge and experience,
p226
aVwe need to structure that.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd the last one is support.
p229
aVWe all started as novices.
p230
aVEverything we do is an approximation of sophistication.
p231
aVWe should expect it to change over time. We have to support that.
p232
aVThe support may come in asking people questions,
p233
aVgiving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it
p234
aVor has some guiding images,
p235
aVbut we need to support it.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, the final piece of this, the take-home message
p238
aVfrom a working memory capacity standpoint is this:
p239
aVwhat we process, we learn.
p240
aVIf we're not processing life, we're not living it.
p241
aVLive life. Thank you.
