VThis is an ambucycle.
p4
aVThis is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency.
p5
aVIt has everything an ambulance has except for a bed.
p6
aVYou see the defibrillator. You see the equipment.
p7
aVWe all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston.
p8
aVWhen I was looking at these pictures,
p9
aVit brought me back many years to my past
p10
aVwhen I was a child.
p11
aVI grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem.
p12
aVWhen I was six years old, I was walking back from school
p13
aVon a Friday afternoon with my older brother.
p14
aVWe were passing by a bus stop.
p15
aVWe saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.
p16
aVThe bus was on fire, and many people were hurt and killed.
p17
aVI remembered an old man
p18
aVyelling to us and crying to help us get him up.
p19
aVHe just needed someone helping him.
p20
aVWe were so scared and we just ran away.
p21
aVGrowing up, I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives.
p22
aVMaybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child.
p23
aVWhen I was 15, I took an EMT course,
p24
aVand I went to volunteer on an ambulance.
p25
aVFor two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem.
p26
aVI helped many people,
p27
aVbut whenever someone really needed help,
p28
aVI never got there in time. We never got there.
p29
aVThe traffic is so bad. The distance, and everything.
p30
aVWe never got there when somebody really needed us.
p31
aVOne day, we received a call about a seven-year-old child
p32
aVchoking from a hot dog.
p33
aVTraffic was horrific, and we were coming from
p34
aVthe other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem.
p35
aVWhen we got there, 20 minutes later,
p36
aVwe started CPR on the kid.
p37
aVA doctor comes in from a block away,
p38
aVstop us, checks the kid, and tells us to stop CPR.
p39
aVThat second he declared this child dead.
p40
aVAt that moment, I understood
p41
aVthat this child died for nothing.
p42
aVIf this doctor, who lived one block away from there,
p43
aVwould have come 20 minutes earlier,
p44
aVnot have to wait until that siren he heard before
p45
aVcoming from the ambulance,
p46
aVif he would have heard about it way before,
p47
aVhe would have saved this child.
p48
aVHe could have run from a block away.
p49
aVHe could have saved this child.
p50
aVI said to myself, there must be a better way.
p51
aVTogether with 15 of my friends \u2014
p52
aVwe were all EMTs \u2014
p53
aVwe decided, let's protect our neighborhood,
p54
aVso when something like that happens again,
p55
aVwe will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance.
p56
aVSo I went over to the manager of the ambulance company
p57
aVand I told him, "Please, whenever you have a call
p58
aVcoming into our neighborhood,
p59
aVwe have 15 great guys who are willing
p60
aVto stop everything they're doing and run and save lives.
p61
aVJust alert us by beeper.
p62
aVWe'll buy these beepers, just tell your dispatch
p63
aVto send us the beeper, and we will run and save lives."
p64
aVWell, he was laughing. I was 17 years old. I was a kid.
p65
aVAnd he said to me \u2014 I remember this like yesterday \u2014
p66
aVhe was a great guy, but he said to me,
p67
aV"Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand.
p68
aVWe're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures.
p69
aVWe're not interested in your help." And he threw me out of the room.
p70
aV"I don't need your help," he said.
p71
aVI was a very stubborn kid.
p72
aVAs you see now, I'm walking around like crazy, meshugenah.
p73
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p74
aVSo I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique
p75
aVyou've probably all heard of, chutzpah. (Laughter)
p76
aVAnd the next day, I went and I bought two police scanners,
p77
aVand I said, "The hell with you, if you don't want
p78
aVto give me information, I'll get the information myself."
p79
aVAnd we did turns, who's going to listen to the radio scanners.
p80
aVThe next day, while I was listening to the scanners,
p81
aVI heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man
p82
aVhurt by a car only one block away from me
p83
aVon the main street of my neighborhood.
p84
aVI ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment.
p85
aVWhen I got there, the 70-year-old man
p86
aVwas lying on the floor, blood was gushing out of his neck.
p87
aVHe was on Coumadin.
p88
aVI knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die.
p89
aVI took off my yarmulke, because I had no medical equipment,
p90
aVand with a lot of pressure, I stopped his bleeding.
p91
aVHe was bleeding from his neck.
p92
aVWhen the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later,
p93
aVI gave them over a patient who was alive.
p94
aV(Applause)
p95
aVWhen I went to visit him two days later,
p96
aVhe gave me a hug and was crying
p97
aVand thanking me for saving his life.
p98
aVAt that moment, when I realized this is the first person
p99
aVI ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance,
p100
aVI knew this is my life's mission.
p101
aVSo today, 22 years later, we have United Hatzalah.
p102
aV(Applause)
p103
aV"Hatzalah" means "rescue," for all of you who don't know Hebrew.
p104
aVI forgot I'm not in Israel.
p105
aVSo we have thousands of volunteers
p106
aVwho are passionate about saving lives,
p107
aVand they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in,
p108
aVthey just stop everything and go and run and save a life.
p109
aVOur average response time today
p110
aVwent down to less than three minutes in Israel.
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aVI'm talking about heart attacks,
p113
aVI'm talking about car accidents,
p114
aVGod forbid bomb attacks, shootings, whatever it is,
p115
aVeven a woman 3 o'clock in the morning
p116
aVfalling in her home and needs someone to help her.
p117
aVThree minutes, we'll have a guy with his pajamas
p118
aVrunning to her house and helping her get up.
p119
aVThe reasons why we're so successful are because of three things.
p120
aVThousands of passionate volunteers
p121
aVwho will leave everything they do
p122
aVand run to help people they don't even know.
p123
aVWe're not there to replace ambulances.
p124
aVWe're just there
p125
aVto get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive.
p126
aVAnd we save people that otherwise would not be saved.
p127
aVThe second reason is because of our technology.
p128
aVYou know, Israelis are good in technology.
p129
aVEvery one of us has on his phone, no matter what kind of phone,
p130
aVa GPS technology done by NowForce,
p131
aVand whenever a call comes in,
p132
aVthe closest five volunteers get the call,
p133
aVand they actually get there really quick,
p134
aVand navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time.
p135
aVAnd this is a great technology we use all over the country
p136
aVand reduce the response time.
p137
aVAnd the third thing are these ambucycles.
p138
aVThese ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.
p139
aVWe don't transfer people, but we stabilize them,
p140
aVand we save their lives.
p141
aVThey never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk.
p142
aVThey never, literally, get stuck in traffic.
p143
aVThat's why we get there so fast.
p144
aVA few years after I started this organization,
p145
aVin a Jewish community,
p146
aVtwo Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up.
p147
aVThey ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me.
p148
aVMuhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.
p149
aVWhen Muhammad told me his personal story,
p150
aVhow his father, 55 years old, collapsed at home,
p151
aVhad a cardiac arrest,
p152
aVand it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive,
p153
aVand he saw his father die in front of his eyes,
p154
aVhe asked me, "Please start this in east Jerusalem."
p155
aVI said to myself, I saw so much tragedy, so much hate,
p156
aVand it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims.
p157
aVIt's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people.
p158
aVSo I went ahead, full force \u2014
p159
aV(Applause) \u2014
p160
aVand I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,
p161
aVand that's why the names United
p162
aVand Hatzalah match so well.
p163
aVWe started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs.
p164
aVArabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs.
p165
aVSomething special happened.
p166
aVArabs and Jews, they don't always get along together,
p167
aVbut here in this situation,
p168
aVthe communities, literally,
p169
aVit's an unbelievable situation that happened,
p170
aVthe diversities, all of a sudden they had a common interest:
p171
aVLet's save lives together.
p172
aVSettlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers.
p173
aVIt's an unbelievable concept that could work
p174
aVonly when you have such a great cause.
p175
aVAnd these are all volunteers.
p176
aVNo one is getting money.
p177
aVThey're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives.
p178
aVWhen my own father collapsed a few years ago
p179
aVfrom a cardiac arrest, one of the first volunteers
p180
aVto arrive to save my father
p181
aVwas one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem
p182
aVwho was in the first course to join Hatzalah.
p183
aVAnd he saved my father.
p184
aVCould you imagine how I felt in that moment?
p185
aVWhen I started this organization, I was 17 years old.
p186
aVI never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED.
p187
aVI never even knew what TEDMED was then.
p188
aVI don't think it existed, but I never imagined,
p189
aVI never imagined that it's going to go all around,
p190
aVit's going to spread around,
p191
aVand this last year we started in Panama and Brazil.
p192
aVAll I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me,
p193
aVpassionate about saving lives, and willing to do it.
p194
aVAnd I'm actually starting it in India very soon
p195
aVwith a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back.
p196
aVHatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew
p197
aVyears before us in Williamsburg,
p198
aVand now it's all over the Jewish community in New York,
p199
aVeven Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities.
p200
aVBut it could spread everywhere.
p201
aVIt's very easy to adopt.
p202
aVYou even saw these volunteers in New York
p203
aVsaving lives in the World Trade Center.
p204
aVLast year alone, we treated in Israel 207,000 people.
p205
aVForty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations.
p206
aVAnd we made a difference.
p207
aVI guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob,
p208
aVand it works.
p209
aVWhen I look all around here,
p210
aVI see lots of people who would go an extra mile,
p211
aVrun an extra mile to save other people,
p212
aVno matter who they are, no matter what religion,
p213
aVno matter who, where they come from.
p214
aVWe all want to be heroes.
p215
aVWe just need a good idea, motivation
p216
aVand lots of chutzpah,
p217
aVand we could save millions of people
p218
aVthat otherwise would not be saved.
p219
aVThank you very much.
