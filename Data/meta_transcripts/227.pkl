VYou know, I've talked about some of these projects before \u2014
p4
aVabout the human genome and what that might mean,
p5
aVand discovering new sets of genes.
p6
aVWe're actually starting at a new point:
p7
aVwe've been digitizing biology,
p8
aVand now we're trying to go from that digital code
p9
aVinto a new phase of biology
p10
aVwith designing and synthesizing life.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, we've always been trying to ask big questions.
p13
aV"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists
p14
aVhave been trying to understand
p15
aVat various levels.
p16
aVWe've tried various approaches,
p17
aVparing it down to minimal components.
p18
aVWe've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;
p19
aVwhen we sequenced the human genome,
p20
aVit was going from the analog world of biology
p21
aVinto the digital world of the computer.
p22
aVNow we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life
p23
aVor can we create new life
p24
aVout of this digital universe?"
p25
aa(lp26
VThis is the map of a small organism,
p27
aVMycoplasma genitalium,
p28
aVthat has the smallest genome for a species
p29
aVthat can self-replicate in the laboratory,
p30
aVand we've been trying to just see if
p31
aVwe can come up with an even smaller genome.
p32
aVWe're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes
p33
aVout of the 500 or so that are here.
p34
aVWhen we look at its metabolic map,
p35
aVit's relatively simple
p36
aVcompared to ours \u2014
p37
aVtrust me, this is simple \u2014
p38
aVbut when we look at all the genes
p39
aVthat we can knock out one at a time,
p40
aVit's very unlikely that this would yield
p41
aVa living cell.
p42
aVSo we decided the only way forward
p43
aVwas to actually synthesize this chromosome
p44
aVso we could vary the components
p45
aVto ask some of these most fundamental questions.
p46
aVAnd so we started down the road of:
p47
aVcan we synthesize a chromosome?
p48
aVCan chemistry permit making
p49
aVthese really large molecules
p50
aVwhere we've never been before?
p51
aVAnd if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?
p52
aVA chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.
p53
aVSo, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing
p54
aVat an exponential pace.
p55
aa(lp56
VOur ability to write the genetic code
p57
aVhas been moving pretty slowly
p58
aVbut has been increasing,
p59
aVand our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
p60
aVWe started this over 15 years ago.
p61
aVIt took several stages, in fact,
p62
aVstarting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.
p63
aVBut it turns out synthesizing DNA
p64
aVis very difficult.
p65
aVThere are tens of thousands of machines around the world
p66
aVthat make small pieces of DNA \u2014
p67
aV30 to 50 letters in length \u2014
p68
aVand it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,
p69
aVthe more errors there are.
p70
aVSo we had to create a new method
p71
aVfor putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information
p74
aVof the genome of phi X174.
p75
aVIt's a small virus that kills bacteria.
p76
aVWe designed the pieces, went through our error correction
p77
aVand had a DNA molecule
p78
aVof about 5,000 letters.
p79
aVThe exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical
p80
aVand put it in the bacteria,
p81
aVand the bacteria started to read this genetic code,
p82
aVmade the viral particles.
p83
aVThe viral particles then were released from the cells
p84
aVand came back and killed the E. coli.
p85
aVI was talking to the oil industry recently
p86
aVand I said they clearly understood that model.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VThey laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd so, we think this is a situation
p93
aVwhere the software can actually build its own hardware
p94
aVin a biological system.
p95
aVBut we wanted to go much larger:
p96
aVwe wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome \u2014
p97
aVit's over 580,000 letters of genetic code \u2014
p98
aVso we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses
p99
aVso we could actually vary the cassettes
p100
aVto understand
p101
aVwhat the actual components of a living cell are.
p102
aVDesign is critical,
p103
aVand if you're starting with digital information in the computer,
p104
aVthat digital information has to be really accurate.
p105
aVWhen we first sequenced this genome in 1995,
p106
aVthe standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
p107
aVWe actually found, on resequencing it,
p108
aV30 errors; had we used that original sequence,
p109
aVit never would have been able to be booted up.
p110
aVPart of the design is designing pieces
p111
aVthat are 50 letters long
p112
aVthat have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces
p113
aVto build smaller subunits
p114
aVwe have to design so they can go together.
p115
aVWe design unique elements into this.
p116
aa(lp117
VYou may have read that we put watermarks in.
p118
aVThink of this:
p119
aVwe have a four-letter genetic code \u2014 A, C, G and T.
p120
aVTriplets of those letters
p121
aVcode for roughly 20 amino acids,
p122
aVsuch that there's a single letter designation
p123
aVfor each of the amino acids.
p124
aVSo we can use the genetic code to write out words,
p125
aVsentences, thoughts.
p126
aVInitially, all we did was autograph it.
p127
aVSome people were disappointed there was not poetry.
p128
aVWe designed these pieces so
p129
aVwe can just chew back with enzymes;
p130
aVthere are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
p131
aVAnd we started making pieces,
p132
aVstarting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,
p133
aVput those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,
p134
aVthen put sets of those going up to 72,000.
p135
aa(lp136
VAt each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance
p137
aVso we could sequence them
p138
aVbecause we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust
p139
aVthat you can see in a minute.
p140
aVWe're trying to get to the point of automation.
p141
aVSo, this looks like a basketball playoff.
p142
aVWhen we get into these really large pieces
p143
aVover 100,000 base pairs,
p144
aVthey won't any longer grow readily in E. coli \u2014
p145
aVit exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology \u2014
p146
aVand so we turned to other mechanisms.
p147
aVWe knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination
p148
aVthat biology uses to repair DNA
p149
aVthat can put pieces together.
p150
aVHere's an example of it:
p151
aVthere's an organism called
p152
aVDeinococcus radiodurans
p153
aVthat can take three millions rads of radiation.
p154
aa(lp155
VYou can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.
p156
aVTwelve to 24 hours later, it put it
p157
aVback together exactly as it was before.
p158
aVWe have thousands of organisms that can do this.
p159
aVThese organisms can be totally desiccated;
p160
aVthey can live in a vacuum.
p161
aVI am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,
p162
aVmove around, find a new aqueous environment.
p163
aVIn fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.
p164
aa(lp165
VHere's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built
p166
aVusing these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms
p167
aVwith the right design of the pieces we put them in;
p168
aVyeast puts them together automatically.
p169
aVThis is not an electron micrograph;
p170
aVthis is just a regular photomicrograph.
p171
aVIt's such a large molecule
p172
aVwe can see it with a light microscope.
p173
aVThese are pictures over about a six-second period.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.
p176
aVThis is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;
p177
aVit's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.
p178
aVIt's over 300 million molecular weight.
p179
aVIf we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,
p180
aVit takes 142 pages
p181
aVjust to print this genetic code.
p182
aVWell, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?
p183
aVObviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;
p184
aVit's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
p185
aVIt's also simpler when you go
p186
aVinto eukaryotes like ourselves:
p187
aVyou can just pop out the nucleus
p188
aVand pop in another one,
p189
aVand that's what you've all heard about with cloning.
p190
aVWith bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,
p191
aVbut we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant
p192
aVof a chromosome from one cell to another
p193
aVand activate it.
p194
aVWe purified a chromosome from one microbial species \u2014
p195
aVroughly, these two are as distant as human and mice \u2014
p196
aVwe added a few extra genes
p197
aVso we could select for this chromosome,
p198
aVwe digested it with enzymes
p199
aVto kill all the proteins,
p200
aVand it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell \u2014
p201
aVand you'll appreciate
p202
aVour very sophisticated graphics here.
p203
aVThe new chromosome went into the cell.
p204
aVIn fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,
p205
aVbut we tried to design the process a little bit further.
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is a major mechanism of evolution right here.
p208
aVWe find all kinds of species
p209
aVthat have taken up a second chromosome
p210
aVor a third one from somewhere,
p211
aVadding thousands of new traits
p212
aVin a second to that species.
p213
aVSo, people who think of evolution
p214
aVas just one gene changing at a time
p215
aVhave missed much of biology.
p216
aa(lp217
VThere are enzymes called restriction enzymes
p218
aVthat actually digest DNA.
p219
aVThe chromosome that was in the cell
p220
aVdoesn't have one;
p221
aVthe chromosome we put in does.
p222
aVIt got expressed and it recognized
p223
aVthe other chromosome as foreign material,
p224
aVchewed it up, and so we ended up
p225
aVjust with a cell with the new chromosome.
p226
aVIt turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
p227
aVAnd with a very short period of time,
p228
aVall the characteristics of one species were lost
p229
aVand it converted totally into the new species
p230
aVbased on the new software that we put in the cell.
p231
aVAll the proteins changed,
p232
aVthe membranes changed;
p233
aVwhen we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, this may sound like genomic alchemy,
p236
aVbut we can, by moving the software of DNA around,
p237
aVchange things quite dramatically.
p238
aVNow I've argued, this is not genesis;
p239
aVthis is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
p240
aVAnd I've argued that we're about to perhaps
p241
aVcreate a new version of the Cambrian explosion,
p242
aVwhere there's massive new speciation
p243
aVbased on this digital design.
p244
aa(lp245
VWhy do this?
p246
aVI think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
p247
aVWe're about to go from six and a half
p248
aVto nine billion people over the next 40 years.
p249
aVTo put it in context for myself:
p250
aVI was born in 1946.
p251
aVThere are now three people on the planet
p252
aVfor every one of us that existed in 1946;
p253
aVwithin 40 years, there'll be four.
p254
aVWe have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,
p255
aVmedicines, fuel
p256
aVfor the six and a half billion.
p257
aVIt's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.
p258
aVWe use over five billion tons of coal,
p259
aV30 billion-plus barrels of oil \u2014
p260
aVthat's a hundred million barrels a day.
p261
aVWhen we try to think of biological processes
p262
aVor any process to replace that,
p263
aVit's going to be a huge challenge.
p264
aVThen of course, there's all that
p265
aVCO2 from this material
p266
aVthat ends up in the atmosphere.
p267
aa(lp268
VWe now, from our discovery around the world,
p269
aVhave a database with about 20 million genes,
p270
aVand I like to think of these as the design components of the future.
p271
aVThe electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,
p272
aVand look at the diversity that came out of that.
p273
aVWe're limited here primarily
p274
aVby a biological reality
p275
aVand our imagination.
p276
aVWe now have techniques,
p277
aVbecause of these rapid methods of synthesis,
p278
aVto do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.
p279
aVWe have the ability now to build a large robot
p280
aVthat can make a million chromosomes a day.
p281
aVWhen you think of processing these 20 million different genes
p282
aVor trying to optimize processes
p283
aVto produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,
p284
aVnew vaccines,
p285
aVwe can just with a small team,
p286
aVdo more molecular biology
p287
aVthan the last 20 years of all science.
p288
aVAnd it's just standard selection:
p289
aVwe can select for viability,
p290
aVchemical or fuel production,
p291
aVvaccine production, etc.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is a screen snapshot
p294
aVof some true design software
p295
aVthat we're working on to actually be able to sit down
p296
aVand design species in the computer.
p297
aVYou know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:
p298
aVwe know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
p299
aVWe're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.
p300
aVYou've seen recently, corn to ethanol
p301
aVis just a bad experiment.
p302
aVWe have second- and third-generation fuels
p303
aVthat will be coming out relatively soon
p304
aVthat are sugar, to much higher-value fuels
p305
aVlike octane or different types of butanol.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut the only way we think that biology
p308
aVcan have a major impact without
p309
aVfurther increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability
p310
aVis if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,
p311
aVand so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.
p312
aVAnd we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels
p313
aVin about 18 months.
p314
aVSunlight and CO2 is one method ...
p315
aV(Applause)
p316
aVbut in our discovery around the world,
p317
aVwe have all kinds of other methods.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis is an organism we described in 1996.
p320
aVIt lives in the deep ocean,
p321
aVabout a mile and a half deep,
p322
aValmost at boiling-water temperatures.
p323
aVIt takes CO2 to methane
p324
aVusing molecular hydrogen as its energy source.
p325
aVWe're looking to see if we can take
p326
aVcaptured CO2,
p327
aVwhich can easily be piped to sites,
p328
aVconvert that CO2 back into fuel
p329
aVto drive this process.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo, in a short period of time,
p332
aVwe think that we might be able to increase
p333
aVwhat the basic question is of "What is life?"
p334
aVWe truly, you know,
p335
aVhave modest goals
p336
aVof replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry \u2014
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VYeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? \u2014
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
Vbecome a major source of energy ...
p345
aVBut also, we're now working on using these same tools
p346
aVto come up with instant sets of vaccines.
p347
aVYou've seen this year with flu;
p348
aVwe're always a year behind and a dollar short
p349
aVwhen it comes to the right vaccine.
p350
aVI think that can be changed
p351
aVby building combinatorial vaccines in advance.
p352
aVHere's what the future may begin to look like
p353
aVwith changing, now, the evolutionary tree,
p354
aVspeeding up evolution
p355
aVwith synthetic bacteria, Archaea
p356
aVand, eventually, eukaryotes.
p357
aVWe're a ways away from improving people:
p358
aVour goal is just to make sure that we have a chance
p359
aVto survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
