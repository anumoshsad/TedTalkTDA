VI'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,
p4
aVand following my training,
p5
aVI moved to Somalia
p6
aVfrom San Francisco.
p7
aVAnd my goodbye greeting
p8
aVfrom the chief of infectious diseases
p9
aVat San Francisco General was,
p10
aV"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."
p11
aa(lp12
VBut I landed in a refugee situation
p13
aVthat had a million refugees in 40 camps,
p14
aVand there were six of us doctors.
p15
aVThere were many epidemics there.
p16
aVMy responsibilities were largely related to
p17
aVtuberculosis,
p18
aVand then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
p19
aVSo it was the spread of tuberculosis
p20
aVand the spread of cholera
p21
aVthat I was responsible for inhibiting.
p22
aVAnd in order to do this work, we, of course,
p23
aVbecause of the limitation in health workers,
p24
aVhad to recruit refugees to be a specialized
p25
aVnew category of health worker.
p26
aVFollowing three years of work in Somalia,
p27
aVI got picked up by the World Health Organization,
p28
aVand got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
p29
aVMy primary responsibility was Uganda,
p30
aVbut also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi
p31
aVand Zaire, now Congo,
p32
aVTanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.
p33
aVAnd my last assignment there was to run a unit
p34
aVcalled intervention development,
p35
aVwhich was responsible for designing interventions.
p36
aa(lp37
VAfter 10 years of working overseas,
p38
aVI was exhausted.
p39
aVI really had very little left.
p40
aVI had been traveling to one country after another.
p41
aVI was emotionally feeling very isolated.
p42
aVI wanted to come home.
p43
aVI'd seen a lot of death,
p44
aVin particular epidemic death,
p45
aVand epidemic death has a different feel to it.
p46
aVIt's full of panic and fear,
p47
aVand I'd heard the women wailing and crying
p48
aVin the desert.
p49
aVAnd I wanted to come home and take a break
p50
aVand maybe start over.
p51
aa(lp52
VI was not aware of any epidemic problems
p53
aVin America.
p54
aVIn fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.
p55
aVIn fact \u2014 seriously.
p56
aVAnd in fact I would visit friends of mine,
p57
aVand I noticed that they had water
p58
aVthat came right into their homes.
p59
aVHow many of you have such a situation?
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVAnd some of them, many of them actually,
p62
aVhad water that came into more than one room.
p63
aVAnd I noticed that they would move
p64
aVthis little thermoregulatory device
p65
aVto change the temperature in their home
p66
aVby one degree or two degrees.
p67
aVAnd now I do that.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I really didn't know what I would do,
p70
aVbut friends of mine began telling me
p71
aVabout children shooting other children with guns.
p72
aVAnd I asked the question,
p73
aVwhat are you doing about it?
p74
aVWhat are you in America doing about it?
p75
aVAnd there were two essential explanations
p76
aVor ideas that were prevalent.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd one was punishment.
p79
aVAnd this I had heard about before.
p80
aVWe who had worked in behavior
p81
aVknew that punishment was something that was discussed
p82
aVbut also that it was highly overvalued.
p83
aVIt was not a main driver of behavior,
p84
aVnor was it a main driver of behavior change.
p85
aVAnd besides that, it reminded me
p86
aVof ancient epidemics
p87
aVthat were previously completely misunderstood
p88
aVbecause the science hadn't been there before,
p89
aVepidemics of plague
p90
aVor typhus or leprosy,
p91
aVwhere the prevalent ideas were that there were
p92
aVbad people or bad humors or bad air,
p93
aVand widows were dragged around the moat,
p94
aVand dungeons were part of the solution.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe other explanation or, in a way,
p97
aVthe solution suggested,
p98
aVis please fix all of these things:
p99
aVthe schools, the community, the homes, the families,
p100
aVeverything.
p101
aVAnd I'd heard this before as well.
p102
aVI'd called this the "everything" theory,
p103
aVor EOE: Everything On Earth.
p104
aVBut we'd also realized
p105
aVin treating other processes and problems
p106
aVthat sometimes you don't need to treat everything.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd so the sense that I had
p109
aVwas there was a giant gap here.
p110
aVThe problem of violence was stuck,
p111
aVand this has historically been the case
p112
aVin many other issues.
p113
aVDiarrheal diseases had been stuck.
p114
aVMalaria had been stuck.
p115
aVFrequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
p116
aVIt's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,
p117
aVbut there was a sense that we would have to do
p118
aVsomething with new categories of workers
p119
aVand something having to do with behavior change
p120
aVand something having to do with public education.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut I began to ask questions
p123
aVand search out the usual things
p124
aVthat I had been exploring before,
p125
aVlike, what do the maps look like?
p126
aVWhat do the graphs look like?
p127
aVWhat does the data look like?
p128
aVAnd the maps of violence
p129
aVin most U.S. cities
p130
aVlooked like this.
p131
aVThere was clustering.
p132
aVThis reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also
p133
aVin infectious epidemics,
p134
aVfor example cholera.
p135
aVAnd then we looked at the maps,
p136
aVand the maps showed this typical wave
p137
aVupon wave upon wave,
p138
aVbecause all epidemics
p139
aVare combinations of many epidemics.
p140
aVAnd it also looked like infectious epidemics.
p141
aVAnd then we asked the question,
p142
aVwell what really predicts a case of violence?
p143
aVAnd it turns out that the greatest predictor
p144
aVof a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
p145
aVWhich also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,
p146
aVsomeone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,
p147
aVor the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis
p148
aVis having been exposed to tuberculosis.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd so we see that violence is, in a way,
p151
aVbehaving like a contagious disease.
p152
aVWe're aware of this anyway
p153
aVeven in our common experiences
p154
aVor our newspaper stories
p155
aVof the spread of violence from fights
p156
aVor in gang wars or in civil wars
p157
aVor even in genocides.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd so there's good news about this, though,
p160
aVbecause there's a way to reverse epidemics,
p161
aVand there's really only three things that are done
p162
aVto reverse epidemics,
p163
aVand the first of it is interrupting transmission.
p164
aVIn order to interrupt transmission,
p165
aVyou need to detect and find first cases.
p166
aVIn other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody
p167
aVwho has active T.B. who is infecting other people.
p168
aVMake sense?
p169
aVAnd there's special workers for doing that.
p170
aVFor this particular problem,
p171
aVwe designed a new category of worker
p172
aVwho, like a SARS worker
p173
aVor someone looking for bird flu,
p174
aVmight find first cases.
p175
aVIn this case, it's someone who's very angry
p176
aVbecause someone looked at his girlfriend
p177
aVor owes him money,
p178
aVand you can find workers and train them
p179
aVinto these specialized categories.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd the second thing to do, of course,
p182
aVis to prevent further spread,
p183
aVthat means to find who else has been exposed,
p184
aVbut may not be spreading so much right now
p185
aVlike someone with a smaller case of T.B.,
p186
aVor someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,
p187
aVbut in the same group,
p188
aVand then they need to be, in a way,
p189
aVmanaged as well,
p190
aVparticular to the specific disease process.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd then the third part, the shifting the norms,
p193
aVand that means a whole bunch of community activities,
p194
aVremodeling, public education,
p195
aVand then you've got what you might call
p196
aVgroup immunity.
p197
aVAnd that combination of factors
p198
aVis how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda
p199
aVwas very successfully reversed.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd so what we decided to do in the year 2000
p202
aVis kind of put this together in a way
p203
aVby hiring in new categories of workers,
p204
aVthe first being violence interruptors.
p205
aVAnd then we would put all of this into place
p206
aVin one neighborhood
p207
aVin what was the worst police district
p208
aVin the United States at the time.
p209
aVSo violence interruptors hired from the same group,
p210
aVcredibility, trust, access,
p211
aVjust like the health workers in Somalia,
p212
aVbut designed for a different category,
p213
aVand trained in persuasion,
p214
aVcooling people down, buying time, reframing.
p215
aVAnd then another category of worker,
p216
aVthe outreach workers, to keep people
p217
aVin a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
p218
aVJust like T.B., but the object is behavior change.
p219
aVAnd then a bunch of community activities
p220
aVfor changing norms.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow our first experiment of this
p223
aVresulted in a 67-percent drop
p224
aVin shootings and killings
p225
aVin the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd this was a beautiful thing
p230
aVfor the neighborhood itself,
p231
aVfirst 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,
p232
aVand then there was unfortunately another shooting
p233
aVin another 90 days,
p234
aVand the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
p235
aVThey were using parks they weren't using before.
p236
aVThe sun was out. Everybody was happy.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,
p239
aVdo it again."
p240
aVAnd so we had to then, fortunately,
p241
aVget the funds to repeat this experience,
p242
aVand this is one of the next four neighborhoods
p243
aVthat had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.
p244
aVAnd since that time, this has been replicated
p245
aV20 times.
p246
aVThere have been independent evaluations
p247
aVsupported by the Justice Department
p248
aVand by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins
p249
aVthat have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent
p250
aVreductions in shootings and killings
p251
aVusing this new method.
p252
aVIn fact, there have been three independent
p253
aVevaluations of this now.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,
p256
aVincluding being featured on
p257
aVThe New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.
p258
aVThe Economist in 2009
p259
aVsaid this is "the approach that will come to prominence."
p260
aVAnd even a movie was made around our work.
p261
aV[The Interrupters]
p262
aa(lp263
VHowever, not so fast,
p264
aVbecause a lot of people did not agree
p265
aVwith this way of going about it.
p266
aVWe got a lot of criticism,
p267
aVa lot of opposition,
p268
aVand a lot of opponents.
p269
aVIn other words, what do you mean, health problem?
p270
aVWhat do you mean, epidemic?
p271
aVWhat do you mean, no bad guys?
p272
aVAnd there's whole industries designed
p273
aVfor managing bad people.
p274
aVWhat do you mean, hiring people
p275
aVwho have backgrounds?
p276
aVMy business friends said,
p277
aV"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.
p278
aVYou must be doing something right."
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VMy musician friends added the word "dude."
p283
aa(lp284
VSo anyway, additionally,
p285
aVthere was still this problem,
p286
aVand we were getting highly criticized as well
p287
aVfor not dealing with all of these other problems.
p288
aVYet we were able to manage malaria
p289
aVand reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases
p290
aVin places with awful economies
p291
aVwithout healing the economy.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo what's actually happened is,
p294
aValthough there is still some opposition,
p295
aVthe movement is clearly growing.
p296
aVMany of the major cities in the U.S.,
p297
aVincluding New York City and Baltimore
p298
aVand Kansas City,
p299
aVtheir health departments are running this now.
p300
aVChicago and New Orleans, the health departments
p301
aVare having a very large role in this.
p302
aVThis is being embraced more by law enforcement
p303
aVthan it had been years ago.
p304
aVTrauma centers and hospitals
p305
aVare doing their part in stepping up.
p306
aVAnd the U.S. Conference of Mayors
p307
aVhas endorsed not only the approach
p308
aVbut the specific model.
p309
aVWhere there's really been uptake even faster
p310
aVis in the international environment,
p311
aVwhere there's a 55-percent drop
p312
aVin the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,
p313
aVwhere interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,
p314
aVwhere the strategy has been applied in Kenya
p315
aVfor the recent elections,
p316
aVand where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo violence is responding as a disease
p319
aVeven as it behaves as a disease.
p320
aVSo the theory, in a way,
p321
aVis kind of being validated by the treatment.
p322
aVAnd recently, the Institute of Medicine
p323
aVcame out with a workshop report
p324
aVwhich went through some of the data,
p325
aVincluding the neuroscience,
p326
aVon how this problem is really transmitted.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo I think this is good news,
p329
aVbecause it allows us an opportunity
p330
aVto come out of the Middle Ages,
p331
aVwhich is where I feel this field has been.
p332
aVIt gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility
p333
aVof replacing some of these prisons
p334
aVwith playgrounds or parks,
p335
aVand to consider the possibility
p336
aVof converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,
p337
aVand to allow there to be a new strategy,
p338
aVa new set of methods, a new set of workers:
p339
aVscience, in a way, replacing morality.
p340
aVAnd moving away from emotions
p341
aVis the most important part of the solution
p342
aVto science as a more important part of the solution.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo I didn't mean to come up with this at all.
p345
aVIt was a matter of,
p346
aVI wanted actually a break,
p347
aVand we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,
p348
aVwe asked some questions
p349
aVand tried some tools
p350
aVthat actually have been used many times before
p351
aVfor other things.
p352
aVFor myself, I tried to get away from
p353
aVinfectious diseases,
p354
aVand I didn't.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you.
