VToday I want to tell you
p4
aVabout a project being carried out
p5
aVby scientists all over the world
p6
aVto paint a neural portrait of the human mind.
p7
aVAnd the central idea of this work
p8
aVis that the human mind and brain
p9
aVis not a single, general-purpose processor,
p10
aVbut a collection of highly specialized components,
p11
aVeach solving a different specific problem,
p12
aVand yet collectively making up
p13
aVwho we are as human beings and thinkers.
p14
aVTo give you a feel for this idea,
p15
aa(lp16
Vimagine the following scenario:
p17
aVYou walk into your child's day care center.
p18
aVAs usual, there's a dozen kids there
p19
aVwaiting to get picked up,
p20
aVbut this time,
p21
aVthe children's faces look weirdly similar,
p22
aVand you can't figure out which child is yours.
p23
aVDo you need new glasses?
p24
aVAre you losing your mind?
p25
aVYou run through a quick mental checklist.
p26
aVNo, you seem to be thinking clearly,
p27
aVand your vision is perfectly sharp.
p28
aVAnd everything looks normal
p29
aVexcept the children's faces.
p30
aVYou can see the faces,
p31
aVbut they don't look distinctive,
p32
aVand none of them looks familiar,
p33
aVand it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon
p34
aVthat you find your daughter.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces
p37
aVactually happens to people.
p38
aVIt's called prosopagnosia,
p39
aVand it results from damage
p40
aVto a particular part of the brain.
p41
aVThe striking thing about it
p42
aVis that only face recognition is impaired;
p43
aVeverything else is just fine.
p44
aa(lp45
VProsopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific
p46
aVmental deficits that can happen after brain damage.
p47
aVThese syndromes collectively
p48
aVhave suggested for a long time
p49
aVthat the mind is divvied up into distinct components,
p50
aVbut the effort to discover those components
p51
aVhas jumped to warp speed
p52
aVwith the invention of brain imaging technology,
p53
aVespecially MRI.
p54
aVSo MRI enables you to see internal anatomy
p55
aVat high resolution,
p56
aVso I'm going to show you in a second
p57
aVa set of MRI cross-sectional images
p58
aVthrough a familiar object,
p59
aVand we're going to fly through them
p60
aVand you're going to try to figure out what the object is.
p61
aVHere we go.
p62
aa(lp63
VIt's not that easy. It's an artichoke.
p64
aa(lp65
VOkay, let's try another one,
p66
aVstarting from the bottom and going through the top.
p67
aVBroccoli! It's a head of broccoli.
p68
aVIsn't it beautiful? I love that.
p69
aa(lp70
VOkay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.
p71
aVIn fact, it's my brain.
p72
aVWe're going through slices through my head like that.
p73
aVThat's my nose over on the right, and now
p74
aVwe're going over here, right there.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,
p77
aVbut it shows only anatomy.
p78
aVThe really cool advance with functional imaging
p79
aVhappened when scientists figured out how to make
p80
aVpictures that show not just anatomy but activity,
p81
aVthat is, where neurons are firing.
p82
aVSo here's how this works.
p83
aVBrains are like muscles.
p84
aVWhen they get active,
p85
aVthey need increased blood flow to supply that activity,
p86
aVand lucky for us, blood flow control to the brain is local,
p87
aVso if a bunch of neurons, say, right there
p88
aVget active and start firing,
p89
aVthen blood flow increases just right there.
p90
aVSo functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase,
p91
aVproducing a higher MRI response
p92
aVwhere neural activity goes up.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo to give you a concrete feel
p95
aVfor how a functional MRI experiment goes
p96
aVand what you can learn from it
p97
aVand what you can't,
p98
aVlet me describe one of the first studies I ever did.
p99
aVWe wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces,
p100
aVand there was already reason to think there might be such a thing
p101
aVbased on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia
p102
aVthat I described a moment ago,
p103
aVbut nobody had ever seen that part of the brain
p104
aVin a normal person,
p105
aVso we set out to look for it.
p106
aVSo I was the first subject.
p107
aVI went into the scanner, I lay on my back,
p108
aVI held my head as still as I could
p109
aVwhile staring at pictures of faces like these
p110
aVand objects like these
p111
aVand faces and objects for hours.
p112
aVSo as somebody who has pretty close to the world record
p113
aVof total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,
p114
aVI can tell you that one of the skills
p115
aVthat's really important for MRI research
p116
aVis bladder control.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VWhen I got out of the scanner,
p120
aVI did a quick analysis of the data,
p121
aVlooking for any parts of my brain
p122
aVthat produced a higher response when I was looking at faces
p123
aVthan when I was looking at objects,
p124
aVand here's what I saw.
p125
aVNow this image looks just awful by today's standards,
p126
aVbut at the time I thought it was beautiful.
p127
aVWhat it shows is that region right there,
p128
aVthat little blob,
p129
aVit's about the size of an olive
p130
aVand it's on the bottom surface of my brain
p131
aVabout an inch straight in from right there.
p132
aVAnd what that part of my brain is doing
p133
aVis producing a higher MRI response,
p134
aVthat is, higher neural activity,
p135
aVwhen I was looking at faces
p136
aVthan when I was looking at objects.
p137
aVSo that's pretty cool,
p138
aVbut how do we know this isn't a fluke?
p139
aVWell, the easiest way
p140
aVis to just do the experiment again.
p141
aVSo I got back in the scanner,
p142
aVI looked at more faces and I looked at more objects
p143
aVand I got a similar blob,
p144
aVand then I did it again
p145
aVand I did it again
p146
aVand again and again,
p147
aVand around about then
p148
aVI decided to believe it was for real.
p149
aVBut still, maybe this is something weird about my brain
p150
aVand no one else has one of these things in there,
p151
aVso to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people
p152
aVand found that pretty much everyone
p153
aVhas that little face-processing region
p154
aVin a similar neighborhood of the brain.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo the next question was,
p157
aVwhat does this thing really do?
p158
aVIs it really specialized just for face recognition?
p159
aVWell, maybe not, right?
p160
aVMaybe it responds not only to faces
p161
aVbut to any body part.
p162
aVMaybe it responds to anything human
p163
aVor anything alive
p164
aVor anything round.
p165
aVThe only way to be really sure that that region
p166
aVis specialized for face recognition
p167
aVis to rule out all of those hypotheses.
p168
aVSo we spent much of the next couple of years
p169
aVscanning subjects while they looked at lots
p170
aVof different kinds of images,
p171
aVand we showed that that part of the brain
p172
aVresponds strongly when you look at
p173
aVany images that are faces of any kind,
p174
aVand it responds much less strongly
p175
aVto any image you show that isn't a face,
p176
aVlike some of these.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo have we finally nailed the case
p179
aVthat this region is necessary for face recognition?
p180
aVNo, we haven't.
p181
aVBrain imaging can never tell you
p182
aVif a region is necessary for anything.
p183
aVAll you can do with brain imaging
p184
aVis watch regions turn on and off
p185
aVas people think different thoughts.
p186
aVTo tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function,
p187
aVyou need to mess with it and see what happens,
p188
aVand normally we don't get to do that.
p189
aVBut an amazing opportunity came about
p190
aVvery recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
p191
aVtested this man who has epilepsy
p192
aVand who is shown here in his hospital bed
p193
aVwhere he's just had electrodes placed
p194
aVon the surface of his brain
p195
aVto identify the source of his seizures.
p196
aVSo it turned out by total chance
p197
aVthat two of the electrodes
p198
aVhappened to be right on top of his face area.
p199
aVSo with the patient's consent,
p200
aVthe doctors asked him what happened
p201
aVwhen they electrically stimulated that part of his brain.
p202
aVNow, the patient doesn't know
p203
aVwhere those electrodes are,
p204
aVand he's never heard of the face area.
p205
aVSo let's watch what happens.
p206
aVIt's going to start with a control condition
p207
aVthat will say "Sham" nearly invisibly
p208
aVin red in the lower left,
p209
aVwhen no current is delivered,
p210
aVand you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face
p213
aVand tell me what happens when I do this.
p214
aVAll right?
p215
aa(lp216
VPatient: Okay.
p217
aa(lp218
VNeurologist: One, two, three.
p219
aa(lp220
VPatient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.
p221
aVI'm going to do it one more time.
p222
aVLook at my face.
p223
aVOne, two, three.
p224
aa(lp225
VPatient: You just turned into somebody else.
p226
aVYour face metamorphosed.
p227
aVYour nose got saggy, it went to the left.
p228
aVYou almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,
p229
aVbut somebody different.
p230
aVThat was a trip.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VNancy Kanwisher: So this experiment \u2014
p234
aV(Applause) \u2014
p235
aVthis experiment finally nails the case
p236
aVthat this region of the brain is not only
p237
aVselectively responsive to faces
p238
aVbut causally involved in face perception.
p239
aVSo I went through all of these details
p240
aVabout the face region to show you what it takes
p241
aVto really establish that a part of the brain
p242
aVis selectively involved in a specific mental process.
p243
aVNext, I'll go through much more quickly
p244
aVsome of the other specialized regions of the brain
p245
aVthat we and others have found.
p246
aVSo to do this, I've spent a lot of time
p247
aVin the scanner over the last month
p248
aVso I can show you these things in my brain.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.
p251
aVSo we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way.
p252
aVImagine taking the skull off
p253
aVand looking at the surface of the brain like that.
p254
aVOkay, now as you can see,
p255
aVthe surface of the brain is all folded up.
p256
aVSo that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
p257
aVWe want to see the whole thing,
p258
aVso let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.
p259
aVNext, let's find that face area I've been talking about
p260
aVthat responds to images like these.
p261
aVTo see that, let's turn the brain around
p262
aVand look on the inside surface on the bottom,
p263
aVand there it is, that's my face area.
p264
aVJust to the right of that is another region
p265
aVthat is shown in purple
p266
aVthat responds when you process color information,
p267
aVand near those regions are other regions
p268
aVthat are involved in perceiving places,
p269
aVlike right now, I'm seeing this layout of space around me
p270
aVand these regions in green right there
p271
aVare really active.
p272
aVThere's another one out on the outside surface again
p273
aVwhere there's a couple more face regions as well.
p274
aVAlso in this vicinity
p275
aVis a region that's selectively involved
p276
aVin processing visual motion,
p277
aVlike these moving dots here,
p278
aVand that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,
p279
aVand near that is a region that responds
p280
aVwhen you look at images of bodies and body parts
p281
aVlike these, and that region is shown in lime green
p282
aVat the bottom of the brain.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow all these regions I've shown you so far
p285
aVare involved in specific aspects of visual perception.
p286
aVDo we also have specialized brain regions
p287
aVfor other senses, like hearing?
p288
aVYes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,
p289
aVhere's a region in dark blue
p290
aVthat we reported just a couple of months ago,
p291
aVand this region responds strongly
p292
aVwhen you hear sounds with pitch, like these.
p293
aV(Sirens)
p294
aV(Cello music)
p295
aV(Doorbell)
p296
aVIn contrast, that same region does not respond strongly
p297
aVwhen you hear perfectly familiar sounds
p298
aVthat don't have a clear pitch, like these.
p299
aV(Chomping)
p300
aV(Drum roll)
p301
aV(Toilet flushing)
p302
aa(lp303
VOkay. Next to the pitch region
p304
aVis another set of regions that are selectively responsive
p305
aVwhen you hear the sounds of speech.
p306
aa(lp307
VOkay, now let's look at these same regions.
p308
aVIn my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement \u2014
p309
aVnot identical, but similar \u2014
p310
aVand most of the same regions are in here,
p311
aValbeit sometimes different in size.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, everything I've shown you so far
p314
aVare regions that are involved in different aspects of perception,
p315
aVvision and hearing.
p316
aVDo we also have specialized brain regions
p317
aVfor really fancy, complicated mental processes?
p318
aVYes, we do.
p319
aVSo here in pink are my language regions.
p320
aVSo it's been known for a very long time
p321
aVthat that general vicinity of the brain
p322
aVis involved in processing language,
p323
aVbut we showed very recently
p324
aVthat these pink regions
p325
aVrespond extremely selectively.
p326
aVThey respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence,
p327
aVbut not when you do other complex mental things,
p328
aVlike mental arithmetic
p329
aVor holding information in memory
p330
aVor appreciating the complex structure
p331
aVin a piece of music.
p332
aa(lp333
VThe most amazing region that's been found yet
p334
aVis this one right here in turquoise.
p335
aVThis region responds
p336
aVwhen you think about what another person is thinking.
p337
aVSo that may seem crazy,
p338
aVbut actually, we humans do this all the time.
p339
aVYou're doing this when you realize
p340
aVthat your partner is going to be worried
p341
aVif you don't call home to say you're running late.
p342
aVI'm doing this with that region of my brain right now
p343
aVwhen I realize that you guys
p344
aVare probably now wondering about
p345
aVall that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,
p346
aVand what's up with that?
p347
aa(lp348
VWell, I'm wondering about that too,
p349
aVand we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now
p350
aVto try to find a number of other
p351
aVpossible specializations in the brain
p352
aVfor other very specific mental functions.
p353
aVBut importantly, I don't think we have
p354
aVspecializations in the brain
p355
aVfor every important mental function,
p356
aVeven mental functions that may be critical for survival.
p357
aVIn fact, a few years ago,
p358
aVthere was a scientist in my lab
p359
aVwho became quite convinced
p360
aVthat he'd found a brain region
p361
aVfor detecting food,
p362
aVand it responded really strongly in the scanner
p363
aVwhen people looked at images like this.
p364
aVAnd further, he found a similar response
p365
aVin more or less the same location
p366
aVin 10 out of 12 subjects.
p367
aVSo he was pretty stoked,
p368
aVand he was running around the lab
p369
aVtelling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"
p370
aVwith his big discovery.
p371
aVBut then he devised the critical test:
p372
aVHe showed subjects images of food like this
p373
aVand compared them to images with very similar
p374
aVcolor and shape, but that weren't food, like these.
p375
aVAnd his region responded the same
p376
aVto both sets of images.
p377
aVSo it wasn't a food area,
p378
aVit was just a region that liked colors and shapes.
p379
aVSo much for "Oprah."
p380
aa(lp381
VBut then the question, of course, is,
p382
aVhow do we process all this other stuff
p383
aVthat we don't have specialized brain regions for?
p384
aVWell, I think the answer is that in addition
p385
aVto these highly specialized components that I've been describing,
p386
aVwe also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads
p387
aVthat enables us to tackle
p388
aVwhatever problem comes along.
p389
aVIn fact, we've shown recently that
p390
aVthese regions here in white
p391
aVrespond whenever you do any difficult mental task
p392
aVat all \u2014
p393
aVwell, of the seven that we've tested.
p394
aVSo each of the brain regions that I've described
p395
aVto you today
p396
aVis present in approximately the same location
p397
aVin every normal subject.
p398
aVI could take any of you,
p399
aVpop you in the scanner,
p400
aVand find each of those regions in your brain,
p401
aVand it would look a lot like my brain,
p402
aValthough the regions would be slightly different
p403
aVin their exact location and in their size.
p404
aa(lp405
VWhat's important to me about this work
p406
aVis not the particular locations of these brain regions,
p407
aVbut the simple fact that we have
p408
aVselective, specific components of mind and brain
p409
aVin the first place.
p410
aVI mean, it could have been otherwise.
p411
aVThe brain could have been a single,
p412
aVgeneral-purpose processor,
p413
aVmore like a kitchen knife
p414
aVthan a Swiss Army knife.
p415
aVInstead, what brain imaging has delivered
p416
aVis this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.
p417
aVSo we have this picture of very general-purpose
p418
aVmachinery in our heads
p419
aVin addition to this surprising array
p420
aVof very specialized components.
p421
aa(lp422
VIt's early days in this enterprise.
p423
aVWe've painted only the first brushstrokes
p424
aVin our neural portrait of the human mind.
p425
aVThe most fundamental questions remain unanswered.
p426
aVSo for example, what does each of these regions do exactly?
p427
aVWhy do we need three face areas
p428
aVand three place areas,
p429
aVand what's the division of labor between them?
p430
aVSecond, how are all these things
p431
aVconnected in the brain?
p432
aVWith diffusion imaging,
p433
aVyou can trace bundles of neurons
p434
aVthat connect to different parts of the brain,
p435
aVand with this method shown here,
p436
aVyou can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain,
p437
aVpotentially someday giving us a wiring diagram
p438
aVof the entire human brain.
p439
aVThird, how does all of this
p440
aVvery systematic structure get built,
p441
aVboth over development in childhood
p442
aVand over the evolution of our species?
p443
aVTo address questions like that,
p444
aVscientists are now scanning
p445
aVother species of animals,
p446
aVand they're also scanning human infants.
p447
aa(lp448
VMany people justify the high cost of neuroscience research
p449
aVby pointing out that it may help us someday
p450
aVto treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.
p451
aVThat's a hugely important goal,
p452
aVand I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,
p453
aVbut fixing things that are broken in the world
p454
aVis not the only thing that's worth doing.
p455
aVThe effort to understand the human mind and brain
p456
aVis worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment
p457
aVof a single disease.
p458
aVWhat could be more thrilling
p459
aVthan to understand the fundamental mechanisms
p460
aVthat underlie human experience,
p461
aVto understand, in essence, who we are?
p462
aVThis is, I think, the greatest scientific quest
p463
aVof all time.
