V\u266b My age is three hundred \u266b
p6
aa(lp7
V\u266b and seventy-two \u266b
p8
aa(lp9
V\u266b I think with the deepest regret \u266b
p10
aa(lp11
V\u266b How I used to pick up
p12
aa(lp13
Vand voraciously chew \u266b
p14
aa(lp15
V\u266b the dear little boys
p16
aa(lp17
Vthat I met \u266b
p18
aa(lp19
V\u266b I've eaten them raw
p20
aa(lp21
Vin their holiday suits, \u266b
p22
aa(lp23
V\u266b Eaten them
p24
aa(lp25
Vcurried with rice, \u266b
p26
aa(lp27
V\u266b I've eaten them baked
p28
aa(lp29
Vin their jackets and boots, \u266b
p30
aa(lp31
V\u266b And found them exceedingly nice. \u266b
p32
aa(lp33
V\u266b But now that my jaws
p34
aa(lp35
Vare too weak for such fare, \u266b
p36
aa(lp37
V\u266b I think it's increasingly rude \u266b
p38
aa(lp39
V\u266b To do such a thing
p40
aa(lp41
Vwhen I'm quite well aware \u266b
p42
aa(lp43
V\u266b Little boys do not like
p44
aa(lp45
Vbeing chewed. \u266b

p48
aa(lp49

p50
aa(lp51
V(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
V\u266b So now I contentedly live upon eels, \u266b
p54
aa(lp55
V\u266b And try to do nothing amiss \u266b
p56
aa(lp57
V\u266b And pass all the time
p58
aa(lp59
VI can spare from my meals \u266b
p60
aa(lp61
V\u266b In innocent slumber like this, \u266b
p62
aa(lp63
V\u266b Innocent slumber
p64

Vlike this. \u266b

p68
aa(lp69
VI suppose I owe you an explanation.
p70
aVI've been working on a project for the last six years
p71
aVadapting children's poetry to music.
p72
aVAnd that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,
p73
aVwho was a stockbroker in New York City
p74
aVfor 45 years,
p75
aVbut in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.
p76
aVAnd this book was one of the most famous books in America
p77
aVfor about 35 years.
p78
aV"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,
p79
aVis one of his poems.
p80
aVNow, we're going to do
p81
aVother poems for you,
p82
aVand here's a preview of some of the poets.
p83
aVThis is Rachel Field,
p84
aVRobert Graves \u2014
p85
aVa very young Robert Graves \u2014
p86
aVChristina Rossetti.
p87
aVGhosts, right?
p88
aVHave nothing to say to us,
p89
aVobsolete,
p90
aVgone \u2014
p91
aVnot so.
p92
aVWhat I really enjoyed about this project
p93
aVis reviving these people's words.
p94
aVTaking them off the dead, flat pages.
p95
aVBringing them to life,
p96
aVbringing them to light.
p97
aVSo, what we're going to do next
p98
aVis a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.
p99
aVNathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
p100
aVWhen she was 10 years old in 1927,
p101
aVshe published her first book of poems
p102
aVcalled "The Janitor's Boy."
p103
aVHere she is.
p104
aVAnd here's her poem.
p105

p107
aa(lp108
V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p109
aa(lp110
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p111
aa(lp112
V\u266b And the janitor's boy
p113
aa(lp114
Vis in love with me. \u266b
p115

V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p117
aa(lp118
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p119
aa(lp120
V\u266b And the janitor's boy
p121
aa(lp122
Vis in love with me. \u266b
p123
aa(lp124
V\u266b He's going to hunt for a desert isle \u266b
p125
aa(lp126
V\u266b In our geography. \u266b
p127
aa(lp128
V\u266b A desert isle
p129
aa(lp130
Vwith spicy trees \u266b
p131
aa(lp132
V\u266b Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; \u266b
p133
aa(lp134
V\u266b A right nice place,
p135
aa(lp136
Vjust fit for two \u266b
p137
aa(lp138
V\u266b Where we can live always. \u266b
p139
aa(lp140
V\u266b Oh, I'm in love
p141
aa(lp142
Vwith the janitor's boy, \u266b
p143
aa(lp144
V\u266b And the janitor's boy, \u266b
p145
aa(lp146
Vhe's busy as can be; \u266b
p147
aa(lp148
V\u266b Down in the cellar he's making a raft \u266b
p149
aa(lp150
V\u266b Out of an old settee. \u266b
p151
aa(lp152
V\u266b He'll carry me off,
p153
aa(lp154
VI know that he will, \u266b
p155
aa(lp156
V\u266b For his hair is exceedingly red; \u266b
p157
aa(lp158
V\u266b And the only thing
p159
aa(lp160
Vthat occurs to me \u266b
p161
aa(lp162
V\u266b Is to dutifully shiver in bed. \u266b
p163
aa(lp164
V\u266b And on the day that we sail,
p165
aa(lp166
VI will leave a little note \u266b
p167
aa(lp168
V\u266b For my parents I hate to annoy: \u266b

VThe next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
p300
aVIt was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
p301
aVShe was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter
p302
aVwho had made his fame in England.
p303
aVHe went there after the death
p304
aVof his wife of smallpox
p305
aVand brought his two young children.
p306
aVOne was his daughter, Laurence.
p307
aVShe wrote this poem when she was
p308
aV18 years old in 1888,
p309
aVand I look at it as kind of a
p310
aVvery sweet feminist manifesto
p311
aVtinged with a little bit of defiance
p312
aVand a little bit of resignation and regret.

VI became very curious about the poets
p382
aVafter spending six years with them,
p383
aVand started to research their lives,
p384
aVand then decided to write a book about it.
p385
aVAnd the burning question about Alma-Tadema
p386
aVwas: Did she marry?
p387
aVAnd the answer was no,
p388
aVwhich I found in the London Times archive.
p389
aVShe died alone in 1940
p390
aVin the company of her books and her dear friends.
p391
aVGerard Manley Hopkins,
p392
aVa saintly man.
p393
aVHe became a Jesuit.
p394
aVHe converted from his Anglican faith.
p395
aVHe was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,
p396
aVthe Oxford Movement, otherwise known as \u2014
p397
aVand he became a Jesuit priest.
p398
aVHe burned all his poetry at the age of 24
p399
aVand then did not write another poem for at least seven years
p400
aVbecause he couldn't rectify the life of a poet
p401
aVwith the life of a priest.
p402
aVHe died typhoid fever
p403
aVat the age of 44, I believe,
p404
aV43 or 44.
p405
aVAt the time, he was teaching classics
p406
aVat Trinity College in Dublin.
p407
aVA few years before he died,
p408
aVafter he had resumed writing poetry,
p409
aVbut in secret,
p410
aVhe confessed to a friend in a letter
p411
aVthat I found when I was doing my research:
p412
aV"I've written a verse.
p413
aVIt is to explain death to a child,
p414
aVand it deserves a piece of plain-song music."
p415
aVAnd my blood froze when I read that
p416
aVbecause I had written the plain-song music
p417
aV130 years after he'd written the letter.
p418
aVAnd the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
p419
aa(lp420
V\u266b Margaret,
