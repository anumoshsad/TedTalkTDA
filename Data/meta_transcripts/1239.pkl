VI'm a garbage man.
p4
aVAnd you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,
p5
aVbecause I absolutely hate waste.
p6
aVI hope, within the next 10 minutes,
p7
aVto change the way you think
p8
aVabout a lot of the stuff in your life.
p9
aVAnd I'd like to start at the very beginning.
p10
aVThink back when you were just a kid.
p11
aVHow did look at the stuff in your life?
p12
aVPerhaps it was like these toddler rules:
p13
aVIt's my stuff if I saw it first.
p14
aVThe entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
p15
aVThe more stuff that's mine, the better.
p16
aVAnd of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VWell after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,
p21
aVit's become pretty clear to me
p22
aVthat we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind
p23
aVas we develop into adults.
p24
aVAnd let me tell you why I have that perspective.
p25
aVBecause each and every day
p26
aVat our recycling plants around the world
p27
aVwe handle about one million pounds
p28
aVof people's discarded stuff.
p29
aVNow a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,
p30
aVbut it's a tiny drop of the durable goods
p31
aVthat are disposed each and every year around the world \u2014
p32
aVwell less than one percent.
p33
aVIn fact, the United Nations estimates
p34
aVthat there's about 85 billion pounds a year
p35
aVof electronics waste
p36
aVthat gets discarded around the world each and every year \u2014
p37
aVand that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
p38
aVAnd if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,
p39
aVthat number well more than doubles.
p40
aVAnd of course, the more developed the country,
p41
aVthe bigger these mountains.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow when you see these mountains,
p44
aVmost people think of garbage.
p45
aVWe see above-ground mines.
p46
aVAnd the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials
p47
aVthat went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
p48
aVAnd it's becoming increasingly important
p49
aVthat we figure out how to extract these raw materials
p50
aVfrom these extremely complicated waste streams.
p51
aVBecause as we've heard all week at TED,
p52
aVthe world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it
p53
aVwho want more and more stuff.
p54
aVAnd of course, they want the toys and the tools
p55
aVthat many of us take for granted.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd what goes into making those toys and tools
p58
aVthat we use every single day?
p59
aVIt's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
p60
aVAnd the metals, we typically get
p61
aVfrom ore that we mine
p62
aVin ever widening mines
p63
aVand ever deepening mines around the world.
p64
aVAnd the plastics, we get from oil,
p65
aVwhich we go to more remote locations
p66
aVand drill ever deeper wells to extract.
p67
aVAnd these practices have
p68
aVsignificant economic and environmental implications
p69
aVthat we're already starting to see today.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff
p72
aVand starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,
p73
aVparticularly in regions of the world like here in Europe
p74
aVthat have recycling policies in place
p75
aVthat require that this stuff be recycled
p76
aVin a responsible manner.
p77
aVMost of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,
p78
aVif it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
p79
aVTo put that in perspective \u2014
p80
aVand I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,
p81
aVbecause it's the most common metal \u2014
p82
aVif your stuff makes it to a recycler,
p83
aVprobably over 90 percent of the metals
p84
aVare going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
p85
aVPlastics are a whole other story:
p86
aVwell less than 10 percent are recovered.
p87
aVIn fact, it's more like five percent.
p88
aVMost of it's incinerated or landfilled.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,
p91
aVhave very little value.
p92
aVBut actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
p93
aVAnd there's more plastics produced and consumed
p94
aVaround the world on a volume basis
p95
aVevery year than steel.
p96
aVSo why is such a plentiful and valuable material
p97
aVnot recovered at anywhere near the rate
p98
aVof the less valuable material?
p99
aVWell it's predominantly because
p100
aVmetals are very easy to recycle
p101
aVfrom other materials and from one another.
p102
aVThey have very different densities.
p103
aVThey have different electrical and magnetic properties.
p104
aVAnd they even have different colors.
p105
aVSo it's very easy for either humans or machines
p106
aVto separate these metals
p107
aVfrom one another and from other materials.
p108
aVPlastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
p109
aVThey have either identical or very similar
p110
aVelectrical and magnetic properties.
p111
aVAnd any plastic can be any color,
p112
aVas you probably well know.
p113
aVSo the traditional ways of separating materials
p114
aVjust simply don't work for plastics.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnother consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans
p117
aVis that a lot of our stuff from the developed world \u2014
p118
aVand sadly to say, particularly from the United States,
p119
aVwhere we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe \u2014
p120
aVfinds its way to developing countries
p121
aVfor low-cost recycling.
p122
aVPeople, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
p123
aVThey extract what they can, which is mostly the metals \u2014
p124
aVcircuit boards and so forth \u2014
p125
aVand they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,
p126
aVwhich is, again, mostly the plastics.
p127
aVOr they burn the plastics to get to the metals
p128
aVin burn houses like you see here.
p129
aVAnd they extract the metals by hand.
p130
aVNow while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,
p131
aVthis is certainly not the low-environmental
p132
aVor human health-and-safety solution.
p133
aVI call this environmental arbitrage.
p134
aVAnd it's not fair, it's not safe
p135
aVand it's not sustainable.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow because the plastics are so plentiful \u2014
p138
aVand by the way,
p139
aVthose other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously \u2014
p140
aVbut people do try to recover the plastics.
p141
aVThis is just one example.
p142
aVThis is a photo I took standing on the rooftops
p143
aVof one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
p144
aVThey store the plastics on the roofs.
p145
aVThey bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,
p146
aVand people try very hard to separate the plastics,
p147
aVby color, by shape, by feel,
p148
aVby any technique they can.
p149
aVAnd sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique
p150
aVwhere they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes
p151
aVto try to determine the type of plastic.
p152
aVNone of these techniques result in any amount of recycling
p153
aVin any significant way.
p154
aVAnd by the way,
p155
aVplease don't try this technique at home.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo what are we to do about this space-age material,
p158
aVat least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
p159
aVWell I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant
p160
aVto keep putting back in the ground
p161
aVor certainly send up in smoke.
p162
aVSo about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,
p163
aVtrying to figure out how to separate
p164
aVthese very similar materials from each other,
p165
aVand eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,
p166
aVin the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,
p167
aVand we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
p168
aVBecause after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
p169
aVAnd we eventually broke the code.
p170
aVThis is the last frontier of recycling.
p171
aVIt's the last major material
p172
aVto be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
p173
aVAnd we finally figured out how to do it.
p174
aVAnd in the process, we started recreating
p175
aVhow the plastics industry makes plastics.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe traditional way to make plastics
p178
aVis with oil or petrochemicals.
p179
aVYou breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,
p180
aVto make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
p181
aVWe said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
p182
aVAnd not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,
p183
aVsustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
p184
aVWell a good place to start is with waste.
p185
aVIt certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,
p186
aVand it's plentiful,
p187
aVas I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
p188
aVAnd because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules
p189
aVand recombining them,
p190
aVwe're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
p191
aa(lp192
VWe have significantly lower capital costs
p193
aVin our plant equipment.
p194
aVWe have enormous energy savings.
p195
aVI don't know how many other projects on the planet right now
p196
aVcan save 80 to 90 percent of the energy
p197
aVcompared to making something the traditional way.
p198
aVAnd instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars
p199
aVto build a chemical plant
p200
aVthat will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,
p201
aVour plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
p202
aVAnd we make a drop-in replacement
p203
aVfor that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
p204
aVOur customers get to enjoy
p205
aVhuge CO2 savings.
p206
aVThey get to close the loop with their products.
p207
aVAnd they get to make more sustainable products.
p208
aa(lp209
VIn the short time period I have,
p210
aVI want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
p211
aVIt starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
p212
aVThey recover the metals
p213
aVand leave behind what's called shredder residue \u2014 it's their waste \u2014
p214
aVa very complex mixture of materials,
p215
aVbut predominantly plastics.
p216
aVWe take out the things that aren't plastics,
p217
aVsuch as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,
p218
aVwood, glass, paper, you name it.
p219
aVEven an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
p220
aVAnd it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
p221
aVWe're sieving the material, we're using magnets,
p222
aVwe're using air classification.
p223
aVIt looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
p224
aa(lp225
VAt the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:
p226
aVmany different types of plastics
p227
aVand many different grades of plastics.
p228
aVThis goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,
p229
aVand the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
p230
aVWe grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
p231
aVWe use a very highly automated process
p232
aVto sort those plastics,
p233
aVnot only by type, but by grade.
p234
aVAnd out the end of that part of the process
p235
aVcome little flakes of plastic:
p236
aVone type, one grade.
p237
aVWe then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
p238
aVWe blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
p239
aVWe push that material to extruders where we melt it,
p240
aVpush it through small die holes,
p241
aVmake spaghetti-like plastic strands.
p242
aVAnd we chop those strands
p243
aVinto what are called pellets.
p244
aVAnd this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
p245
aVThis is the same material
p246
aVthat you would get from oil.
p247
aVAnd today,
p248
aVwe're producing it from your old stuff,
p249
aVand it's going right back into your new stuff.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VSo now, instead of your stuff ending up
p254
aVon a hillside in a developing country
p255
aVor literally going up in smoke,
p256
aVyou can find your old stuff
p257
aVback on top of your desk in new products,
p258
aVin your office,
p259
aVor back at work in your home.
p260
aVAnd these are just a few examples
p261
aVof companies that are buying our plastic,
p262
aVreplacing virgin plastic,
p263
aVto make their new products.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo I hope I've changed the way you look at
p266
aVat least some of the stuff in your life.
p267
aVWe took our clues from mother nature.
p268
aVMother nature wastes very little,
p269
aVreuses practically everything.
p270
aVAnd I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer \u2014
p271
aVthat's a label I've always hated my entire life \u2014
p272
aVand think of yourself as just using resources in one form,
p273
aVuntil they can be transformed to another form
p274
aVfor another use later in time.
p275
aVAnd finally, I hope you agree with me
p276
aVto change that last toddler rule just a little bit
p277
aVto: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."
p278
aa(lp279
VThank you for your time.
