VWhen I was a kid, I was the quintessential nerd.
p4
aVI think some of you were, too.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd you, sir, who laughed the loudest, you probably still are.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI grew up in a small town in the dusty plains of north Texas,
p13
aVthe son of a sheriff who was the son of a pastor.
p14
aVGetting into trouble was not an option.
p15
aVAnd so I started reading calculus books for fun.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VYou did, too.
p20
aVThat led me to building a laser and a computer and model rockets,
p21
aVand that led me to making rocket fuel in my bedroom.
p22
aVNow, in scientific terms,
p23
aVwe call this a very bad idea.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VAround that same time,
p28
aVStanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" came to the theaters,
p29
aVand my life was forever changed.
p30
aVI loved everything about that movie,
p31
aVespecially the HAL 9000.
p32
aVNow, HAL was a sentient computer
p33
aVdesigned to guide the Discovery spacecraft
p34
aVfrom the Earth to Jupiter.
p35
aVHAL was also a flawed character,
p36
aVfor in the end he chose to value the mission over human life.
p37
aVNow, HAL was a fictional character,
p38
aVbut nonetheless he speaks to our fears,
p39
aVour fears of being subjugated
p40
aVby some unfeeling, artificial intelligence
p41
aVwho is indifferent to our humanity.
p42
aa(lp43
VI believe that such fears are unfounded.
p44
aVIndeed, we stand at a remarkable time
p45
aVin human history,
p46
aVwhere, driven by refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds,
p47
aVwe are building machines
p48
aVof exquisite, beautiful complexity and grace
p49
aVthat will extend the human experience
p50
aVin ways beyond our imagining.
p51
aa(lp52
VAfter a career that led me from the Air Force Academy
p53
aVto Space Command to now,
p54
aVI became a systems engineer,
p55
aVand recently I was drawn into an engineering problem
p56
aVassociated with NASA's mission to Mars.
p57
aVNow, in space flights to the Moon,
p58
aVwe can rely upon mission control in Houston
p59
aVto watch over all aspects of a flight.
p60
aVHowever, Mars is 200 times further away,
p61
aVand as a result it takes on average 13 minutes
p62
aVfor a signal to travel from the Earth to Mars.
p63
aVIf there's trouble, there's not enough time.
p64
aVAnd so a reasonable engineering solution
p65
aVcalls for us to put mission control
p66
aVinside the walls of the Orion spacecraft.
p67
aVAnother fascinating idea in the mission profile
p68
aVplaces humanoid robots on the surface of Mars
p69
aVbefore the humans themselves arrive,
p70
aVfirst to build facilities
p71
aVand later to serve as collaborative members of the science team.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, as I looked at this from an engineering perspective,
p74
aVit became very clear to me that what I needed to architect
p75
aVwas a smart, collaborative,
p76
aVsocially intelligent artificial intelligence.
p77
aVIn other words, I needed to build something very much like a HAL
p78
aVbut without the homicidal tendencies.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VLet's pause for a moment.
p83
aVIs it really possible to build an artificial intelligence like that?
p84
aVActually, it is.
p85
aVIn many ways,
p86
aVthis is a hard engineering problem
p87
aVwith elements of AI,
p88
aVnot some wet hair ball of an AI problem that needs to be engineered.
p89
aVTo paraphrase Alan Turing,
p90
aVI'm not interested in building a sentient machine.
p91
aVI'm not building a HAL.
p92
aVAll I'm after is a simple brain,
p93
aVsomething that offers the illusion of intelligence.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe art and the science of computing have come a long way
p96
aVsince HAL was onscreen,
p97
aVand I'd imagine if his inventor Dr. Chandra were here today,
p98
aVhe'd have a whole lot of questions for us.
p99
aVIs it really possible for us
p100
aVto take a system of millions upon millions of devices,
p101
aVto read in their data streams,
p102
aVto predict their failures and act in advance?
p103
aVYes.
p104
aVCan we build systems that converse with humans in natural language?
p105
aVYes.
p106
aVCan we build systems that recognize objects, identify emotions,
p107
aVemote themselves, play games and even read lips?
p108
aVYes.
p109
aVCan we build a system that sets goals,
p110
aVthat carries out plans against those goals and learns along the way?
p111
aVYes.
p112
aVCan we build systems that have a theory of mind?
p113
aVThis we are learning to do.
p114
aVCan we build systems that have an ethical and moral foundation?
p115
aVThis we must learn how to do.
p116
aVSo let's accept for a moment
p117
aVthat it's possible to build such an artificial intelligence
p118
aVfor this kind of mission and others.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe next question you must ask yourself is,
p121
aVshould we fear it?
p122
aVNow, every new technology
p123
aVbrings with it some measure of trepidation.
p124
aVWhen we first saw cars,
p125
aVpeople lamented that we would see the destruction of the family.
p126
aVWhen we first saw telephones come in,
p127
aVpeople were worried it would destroy all civil conversation.
p128
aVAt a point in time we saw the written word become pervasive,
p129
aVpeople thought we would lose our ability to memorize.
p130
aVThese things are all true to a degree,
p131
aVbut it's also the case that these technologies
p132
aVbrought to us things that extended the human experience
p133
aVin some profound ways.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo let's take this a little further.
p136
aVI do not fear the creation of an AI like this,
p137
aVbecause it will eventually embody some of our values.
p138
aVConsider this: building a cognitive system is fundamentally different
p139
aVthan building a traditional software-intensive system of the past.
p140
aVWe don't program them. We teach them.
p141
aVIn order to teach a system how to recognize flowers,
p142
aVI show it thousands of flowers of the kinds I like.
p143
aVIn order to teach a system how to play a game \u2014
p144
aVWell, I would. You would, too.
p145
aVI like flowers. Come on.
p146
aVTo teach a system how to play a game like Go,
p147
aVI'd have it play thousands of games of Go,
p148
aVbut in the process I also teach it
p149
aVhow to discern a good game from a bad game.
p150
aVIf I want to create an artificially intelligent legal assistant,
p151
aVI will teach it some corpus of law
p152
aVbut at the same time I am fusing with it
p153
aVthe sense of mercy and justice that is part of that law.
p154
aVIn scientific terms, this is what we call ground truth,
p155
aVand here's the important point:
p156
aVin producing these machines,
p157
aVwe are therefore teaching them a sense of our values.
p158
aVTo that end, I trust an artificial intelligence
p159
aVthe same, if not more, as a human who is well-trained.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut, you may ask,
p162
aVwhat about rogue agents,
p163
aVsome well-funded nongovernment organization?
p164
aVI do not fear an artificial intelligence in the hand of a lone wolf.
p165
aVClearly, we cannot protect ourselves against all random acts of violence,
p166
aVbut the reality is such a system
p167
aVrequires substantial training and subtle training
p168
aVfar beyond the resources of an individual.
p169
aVAnd furthermore,
p170
aVit's far more than just injecting an internet virus to the world,
p171
aVwhere you push a button, all of a sudden it's in a million places
p172
aVand laptops start blowing up all over the place.
p173
aVNow, these kinds of substances are much larger,
p174
aVand we'll certainly see them coming.
p175
aa(lp176
VDo I fear that such an artificial intelligence
p177
aVmight threaten all of humanity?
p178
aVIf you look at movies such as "The Matrix," "Metropolis,"
p179
aV"The Terminator," shows such as "Westworld,"
p180
aVthey all speak of this kind of fear.
p181
aVIndeed, in the book "Superintelligence" by the philosopher Nick Bostrom,
p182
aVhe picks up on this theme
p183
aVand observes that a superintelligence might not only be dangerous,
p184
aVit could represent an existential threat to all of humanity.
p185
aVDr. Bostrom's basic argument
p186
aVis that such systems will eventually
p187
aVhave such an insatiable thirst for information
p188
aVthat they will perhaps learn how to learn
p189
aVand eventually discover that they may have goals
p190
aVthat are contrary to human needs.
p191
aVDr. Bostrom has a number of followers.
p192
aVHe is supported by people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.
p193
aVWith all due respect
p194
aVto these brilliant minds,
p195
aVI believe that they are fundamentally wrong.
p196
aVNow, there are a lot of pieces of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack,
p197
aVand I don't have time to unpack them all,
p198
aVbut very briefly, consider this:
p199
aVsuper knowing is very different than super doing.
p200
aVHAL was a threat to the Discovery crew
p201
aVonly insofar as HAL commanded all aspects of the Discovery.
p202
aVSo it would have to be with a superintelligence.
p203
aVIt would have to have dominion over all of our world.
p204
aVThis is the stuff of Skynet from the movie "The Terminator"
p205
aVin which we had a superintelligence
p206
aVthat commanded human will,
p207
aVthat directed every device that was in every corner of the world.
p208
aVPractically speaking,
p209
aVit ain't gonna happen.
p210
aVWe are not building AIs that control the weather,
p211
aVthat direct the tides,
p212
aVthat command us capricious, chaotic humans.
p213
aVAnd furthermore, if such an artificial intelligence existed,
p214
aVit would have to compete with human economies,
p215
aVand thereby compete for resources with us.
p216
aVAnd in the end \u2014
p217
aVdon't tell Siri this \u2014
p218
aVwe can always unplug them.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VWe are on an incredible journey
p223
aVof coevolution with our machines.
p224
aVThe humans we are today
p225
aVare not the humans we will be then.
p226
aVTo worry now about the rise of a superintelligence
p227
aVis in many ways a dangerous distraction
p228
aVbecause the rise of computing itself
p229
aVbrings to us a number of human and societal issues
p230
aVto which we must now attend.
p231
aVHow shall I best organize society
p232
aVwhen the need for human labor diminishes?
p233
aVHow can I bring understanding and education throughout the globe
p234
aVand still respect our differences?
p235
aVHow might I extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare?
p236
aVHow might I use computing
p237
aVto help take us to the stars?
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd that's the exciting thing.
p240
aVThe opportunities to use computing
p241
aVto advance the human experience
p242
aVare within our reach,
p243
aVhere and now,
p244
aVand we are just beginning.
p245
