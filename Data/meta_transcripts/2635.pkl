VTiq Milan: Our first conversation was on Facebook,
p4
aVand it was three days long.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VWe shared over 3,000 messages between us,
p9
aVand it was during those 72 hours that I knew she was going to be my wife.
p10
aVWe didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship;
p11
aVwe told each other the vulnerable truths up front:
p12
aVI am a transgender man,
p13
aVwhich means the F on my birth certificate should have stood for "False,"
p14
aVinstead of "Female."
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VWalking around as a woman in the world
p19
aVfelt like walking with pebbles in my shoes.
p20
aVIt took the rhythm out of my swagger,
p21
aVit threw me off balance,
p22
aVit pained me with every step I took forward.
p23
aVBut today I'm a man of my own intention;
p24
aVa man of my own design.
p25
aa(lp26
VKim Katrin Milan: I am a cisgender queer woman.
p27
aVCisgender means the gender I was assigned at birth
p28
aVis still and has always been female.
p29
aVThis doesn't make me natural or normal,
p30
aVthis is just one way of describing the many different ways
p31
aVthat we exist in this world.
p32
aVAnd queer is a cultural term,
p33
aVbut in this case,
p34
aVit refers to the way that I'm not restricted by gender
p35
aVwhen it comes to choosing partners.
p36
aVI've identified in a few different ways \u2014
p37
aVas a bisexual, as a lesbian \u2014
p38
aVbut for me,
p39
aVqueerness encompasses all of the layers of who I am and how I've loved.
p40
aVI'm layers, and not fractions.
p41
aVAnd for me,
p42
aVthe fact that he was queer
p43
aVmeant that I could trust his courtship from the very beginning.
p44
aa(lp45
VAs queer and trans people,
p46
aVwe're so often excluded from institutions and traditions.
p47
aVWe create spaces outside of convention,
p48
aVincluding the conventions of time.
p49
aVAnd in those 3,000 messages between us,
p50
aVwe collapsed time;
p51
aVwe queered it;
p52
aVwe laid it all on the table.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VWith no pretense at all.
p57
aVAnd this meant that we were able to commit to each other
p58
aVin a profoundly different way.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo often what we're told is this idea of the "Golden Rule,"
p61
aVthat we should treat other people the way we want to be treated.
p62
aVBut the problem with that
p63
aVis that it assumes that we are the standard for other people,
p64
aVand we're not.
p65
aVWe need to treat other people the way they want to be treated,
p66
aVwhich means we had to ask.
p67
aVI couldn't assume that the kind of love that Tiq needed
p68
aVwas the same kind of love that I needed.
p69
aVSo I asked him everything \u2014 about his fears, his insecurities \u2014
p70
aVand we started from there.
p71
aa(lp72
VTM: I didn't know what kind of love I needed.
p73
aVI had just come out of a year-long fog
p74
aVof being rejected and utterly depleted.
p75
aVI had someone look me in my eyes
p76
aVand tell me that I was unworthy of their love because I was trans.
p77
aVAnd there's a culture of lovelessness
p78
aVthat we've created around transgender people.
p79
aVIt's reasoned, justified and often signed into law.
p80
aVAnd I was a heartbeat away from internalizing that message,
p81
aVthat I wasn't worthy.
p82
aVBut Kim said that I was her ideal \u2014
p83
aVthe heartbroken mess that I was.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VKKM: He totally was my ideal.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VIn more ways than one.
p92
aVBoth poets, writers, creatives
p93
aVwith a long history of community work behind us,
p94
aVand big, huge dreams of a family in front of us,
p95
aVwe shared a lot of things in common,
p96
aVbut we were also incredibly different.
p97
aVI've been a lifelong traveler and a bit of an orphan,
p98
aVwhereas he comes from a huge family,
p99
aVand definitely stays grounded.
p100
aVI often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths
p101
aVby saying, "Keep me safe,
p102
aVand I'll keep you wild."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VTM: We have marginalized identities but we don't live marginalized lives.
p107
aVBeing queer and trans is about creating new ways of existing.
p108
aVIt's about loving people as they are,
p109
aVnot as they're supposed to be.
p110
aVKim is unapologetically feminine
p111
aVin a world that is often cruel and violent
p112
aVto women who are too proud and too freeing.
p113
aVAnd I didn't enter into this union
p114
aVunder the auspices that she was going to be my helper or my rib,
p115
aVbut a fully complex \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VKKM: Right? That's not right.
p120
aa(lp121
VTM: But a fully complex human being
p122
aVwhose femininity wasn't for me to rein in, control or critique.
p123
aVIt's her brilliance,
p124
aVthe way she leads with compassion,
p125
aVand how she never loses sight of her empathy.
p126
aVShe has been my hero since day one.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VKKM: Our relationship has always been about setting each other free.
p131
aVOne of the first questions I asked him
p132
aVwas what dreams he had left to accomplish,
p133
aVand how would I help him get there.
p134
aVHis dreams to live as a poet,
p135
aVto adopt and raise a family together,
p136
aVto live a life that he was proud of,
p137
aVand one that would live up to his mother's incredible legacy.
p138
aVAnd I really appreciated that we were able to start from that place,
p139
aVand not from a place that was around figuring out
p140
aVhow to make each other work together.
p141
aVAnd I think this really allowed us to grow into the people that we were
p142
aVin a way that was incredibly different.
p143
aVI love him whole;
p144
aVpre-transition, now and in the future.
p145
aVAnd it's this love that had us committed to each other
p146
aVbefore we'd even seen each other's faces.
p147
aa(lp148
VTM: My mother's biggest concern when I transitioned
p149
aVwas who was going to love me as I am.
p150
aVHad being transgender somehow precluded me from love and monogamy
p151
aVbecause I was supposedly born in the wrong body?
p152
aVBut it's this type of structuring that has to be reframed
p153
aVin order to let love in.
p154
aVMy body never betrayed me,
p155
aVand my body was never wrong.
p156
aVIt's this restrictive, binary thinking on gender
p157
aVthat said that I didn't exist.
p158
aVBut when we met,
p159
aVshe loved me for exactly how I showed up.
p160
aVShe would trace her fingers along the numb keloid scars
p161
aVleft by my top surgery.
p162
aVScars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso.
p163
aVShe said that these were reminders of my strength
p164
aVand everything that I went through
p165
aVand nothing for me to be ashamed of.
p166
aVSo sprinting towards her hand in marriage
p167
aVwas the queerest thing that I could do.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VIt flew in the face of more conventional trajectories
p172
aVof love and relationships,
p173
aVbecause God was never supposed to bless a union for folks like us,
p174
aVand the law was never supposed to recognize it.
p175
aa(lp176
VKKM: So on May 5, 2014,
p177
aVjust about three months after meeting online,
p178
aVwe were married on the steps of City Hall in Manhattan,
p179
aVand it was beautiful in every conceivable way.
p180
aVIt's safe to say that we reimagined some traditions,
p181
aVbut we also kept some old ones that we worked in,
p182
aVand we created something that worked for us.
p183
aVMy bouquet and corsage was actually filled with wildflowers from Brooklyn \u2014
p184
aValso added in a little bit of lavender and sage to keep us grounded
p185
aVbecause we were so nervous.
p186
aVAnd it was put together by a sweet sister healer friend of ours.
p187
aVI never wanted a diamond ring,
p188
aVbecause conflict and convention are not my thing,
p189
aVso my ring is the deepest purple,
p190
aVlike the color of my crown chakra,
p191
aVand set in place with my birthstones.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe gift of queerness is options.
p194
aVI never had to choose his last name,
p195
aVit was never an exception,
p196
aVbut I did because I am my father's bastard child,
p197
aVsomeone who has always been an apology, a secret, an imposition.
p198
aVAnd it was incredibly freeing
p199
aVto choose the name of a man who chose me first.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VTM: So we told some family and some close friends,
p204
aVmany of whom were still in disbelief as we took our vows.
p205
aVFittingly, we posted all of our wedding photos on Facebook,
p206
aVwhere we met \u2014
p207
aVand Instagram, of course.
p208
aVAnd we quickly realized
p209
aVthat our coming together was more than just a union of two people,
p210
aVbut was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks
p211
aVwho have been sold this lie
p212
aVthat family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are \u2014
p213
aVfor those of us who rarely get to see ourselves
p214
aVreflected in love and happiness.
p215
aa(lp216
VKKM: And the thing is,
p217
aVabsolutely we are marginalized because of our identities,
p218
aVbut it also emboldens us to be the people that we are.
p219
aVQueerness is our major key;
p220
aVblackness is our magic.
p221
aVIt's because of these things
p222
aVthat we are able to be hopeful, open, receptive and shape-shifting.
p223
aVThese are the things that give us,
p224
aVand are such an incredible source of, our strength.
p225
aVOur queerness is a source of that strength.
p226
aa(lp227
VI think of the words of Ottawa-based poet Brandon Wint:
p228
aV"Not queer like gay; queer like escaping definition.
p229
aVQueer like some sort of fluidity and limitlessness all at once.
p230
aVQueer like a freedom too strange to be conquered.
p231
aVQueer like the fearlessness to imagine what love can look like,
p232
aVand to pursue it."
p233
aa(lp234
VTM: We are part of a community of folks \u2014
p235
aVYeah, that's good right?
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VWe are part of a community of folks who are living their authentic selves
p240
aVall along the gender spectrum,
p241
aVdespite the ubiquitous threat of violence,
p242
aVdespite the undercurrent of anxiety that always is present
p243
aVfor people who live on their own terms.
p244
aVGlobally, a transgender person is murdered every 21 hours.
p245
aVAnd the United States has had more trans murders on record this year
p246
aVthan any year to date.
p247
aVHowever, our stories are much more than this rigid dichotomy
p248
aVof strength and resilience.
p249
aVWe are expanding the human complexity on these margins,
p250
aVand we are creating freedom on these margins.
p251
aa(lp252
VKKM: And we don't have any blueprints.
p253
aVWe're creating a world that we have literally never seen before;
p254
aVorganizing families based on love and not by blood,
p255
aVguiding by a compassion that so few of us have been shown ourselves.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo many of us have not received love from our families \u2014
p258
aVhave been betrayed by the people that we trust most.
p259
aVSo what we do here is we create entirely new languages of love.
p260
aVOnes that are about creating the space for us to be our authentic selves
p261
aVand not imposing this standard
p262
aVof what masculinity or femininity is supposed to be.
p263
aa(lp264
VTM: We are interested in love and inclusion
p265
aVas a tool of revolutionary change, right?
p266
aVAnd the idea is simply,
p267
aVif we drop all our preconceived notions
p268
aVabout how somebody is supposed to be \u2014
p269
aVin their body, in their gender, in their skin \u2014
p270
aVif we take the intentional steps to unlearn these deep-seated biases
p271
aVand create space for people to be self-determined,
p272
aVand embrace who they are,
p273
aVthen we will definitely create a better world than the one we were born into.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Applause)
p276
aa(lp277
VKKM: We want to mark this time in history
p278
aVby leaving evidence of the fact that we were here.
p279
aVWe open up little windows into our relationship
p280
aVfor our community to bear witness,
p281
aVand we do this because we want to make maps to the future
p282
aVand not monuments to ourselves.
p283
aVOur experience does not invalidate other peoples' experience,
p284
aVbut it should and necessarily does complicate this idea
p285
aVof what love and marriage are supposed to be.
p286
aa(lp287
VTM: OK, now for all the talking,
p288
aVand inspiring,
p289
aVand possibility-modeling we've done,
p290
aVwe've been nowhere near perfect.
p291
aVAnd we've had to hold a mirror up to ourselves.
p292
aVAnd I saw that I wasn't always the best listener,
p293
aVand that my ego got in the way of our progress as a couple.
p294
aVAnd I've had to really assess these deep-seated, sexist ideas
p295
aVthat I've had about the value of a woman's experience in the world.
p296
aVI've had to reevaluate what it means to be in allyship with my wife.
p297
aa(lp298
VKKM: And I had to remind myself of a lot of things, too.
p299
aVWhat it means to be hard on the issues,
p300
aVbut soft on the person.
p301
aVWhile we were writing this, we got into a massive fight.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VFor so many different reasons,
p306
aVbut based on the content about our values and our lived experiences \u2014
p307
aVand we were really hurt, you know?
p308
aVBecause what we do and how we love puts ourselves entirely on the line.
p309
aVBut even though the fight lasted over the course of two days \u2014
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VWe were able to come back together to each other,
p314
aVand recommit to ourselves, to each other and to our marriage.
p315
aVAnd that really yielded some of the most passionate parts
p316
aVof what we share with you here today.
p317
aa(lp318
VTM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,
p319
aVwhich I think doesn't happen enough.
p320
aVI've had to interrogate masculinity;
p321
aVthe toxic privileges that come with being a man don't define me,
p322
aVbut I have to be accountable for how it shows up in my life every day.
p323
aVI have allowed my wife to do all of the emotional labor
p324
aVof prying open the lines of communication when I'd rather clam up and run away.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VI've stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,
p329
aVparticularly around the heartbreaking miscarriage we suffered last year,
p330
aVand I'm sorry for that.
p331
aVSometimes as men, we get to take the easy way out.
p332
aVAnd so my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity.
p333
aVAbout creating a manhood that isn't measured
p334
aVby the power it wields, by the entitlements afforded to it,
p335
aVor any simulacrum of control that it can muster,
p336
aVbut works in tandem with femininity,
p337
aVand is guided by my spirit.
p338
aa(lp339
VKKM: Y'all ...
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd this has created the space for my femininity to flourish
p344
aVin a way I had never experienced before.
p345
aVHe never is threatened by my sexuality,
p346
aVhe never polices what I wear or how I act.
p347
aVI cook but he does way more of the cleaning than I do.
p348
aVAnd when we're rushing to get out of the house
p349
aVand we have so much to handle,
p350
aVhe handles everything,
p351
aVso I have time to do my hair and makeup.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VHe understands that this is my armor,
p356
aVand he never treats femininity as though it is frivolous or superficial,
p357
aVand this, and him \u2014
p358
aVhe grows my experience of gender every single day.
p359
aa(lp360
VTM: I love to watch her get dressed in the morning.
p361
aVWatching her in the closet,
p362
aVlooking for something comfortable and colorful, and tight,
p363
aVand safe \u2014
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VBut it's challenging to watch her negotiate her decisions
p368
aVlooking for something that's going to get the least amount of attention,
p369
aVbut at the same time be an expression of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.
p370
aVAnd all I want to do is celebrate her for her beauty,
p371
aVand the things that make her beautiful and special and free,
p372
aVfrom her long acrylic nails,
p373
aVto her uncompromising black feminism.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VKKM: I love you. TM: I love you.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VKKM: There are so many queer and trans people
p382
aVwho have come before us,
p383
aVwhose stories we will never get to hear.
p384
aVWe constantly experience this retelling of history
p385
aVwhere we are conspicuously left out.
p386
aVAnd it's really hard to not see ourselves there.
p387
aVAnd so living out loud for us is about that representation.
p388
aVIt's about having possibility models,
p389
aVand having hope that love is part of our inheritance in this world, too.
p390
aa(lp391
VTM: The possibility that we are practicing
p392
aVis about reinventing time, love and institutions.
p393
aVWe are creating a future of multiplicity.
p394
aVWe are expanding the spectrum of gender and sexuality,
p395
aVimagining ourselves into existence,
p396
aVimagining a world where gender is self-determined and not imposed,
p397
aVand where who we are is a kaleidoscope of possibility
p398
aVwithout the narrow-minded limitations masquerading as science or justice.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Applause)
p401
aa(lp402
VKKM: And I can't lie:
p403
aVit is really, really hard.
p404
aVIt is hard to stand in the face of bigotry
p405
aVwith an open heart and a smile on my face.
p406
aVIt is really hard to face the injustice that exists in the world,
p407
aVwhile still believing in the ability of people to really change.
p408
aVThat takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication.
p409
aVAnd beyond that,
p410
aVmarriage is hard work.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VPiles of dirty socks on the floor,
p415
aVmore boring sports shows than I ever thought possible \u2014
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VAnd fights that bring me to tears
p420
aVwhen it feels like we're not speaking the same language.
p421
aVBut there is not a day that goes by
p422
aVwhere I am not so grateful to be married to this man;
p423
aVwhere I'm not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds,
p424
aVand rewarding conversations,
p425
aVand creating a world where love belongs to us all.
p426
aa(lp427
VI think about our acronym:
p428
aVLGBTQ2SIA.
p429
aVA seemingly endless evolution of self and a community,
p430
aVbut also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind.
p431
aVWe've learned how to love each other,
p432
aVand we've committed to loving each other throughout changes to gender
p433
aVand changes in spirit.
p434
aVAnd we learned this love in our chat rooms,
p435
aVin our clubs, in our bars and in our community centers.
p436
aVWe've learned how to love each other for the long haul.
p437
aa(lp438
