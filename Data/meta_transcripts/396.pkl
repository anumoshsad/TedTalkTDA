VI have, like, a thing about sleeping.
p4
aVI don't sleep that much,
p5
aVand I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much
p6
aVas being a great virtue, after years of kind of
p7
aVbattling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.
p8
aVAnd now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.
p9
aVBut for years I've been sitting up
p10
aVand I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.
p11
aVI lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.
p12
aVSometimes I used to walk more at night.
p13
aVI walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd sometimes \u2014 actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,
p17
aVthat I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,
p18
aVbut I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.
p19
aVAnd so I was following this guy.
p20
aVAnd I took a picture of his shoes,
p21
aVand we thanked each other and just went on our way.
p22
aVBut I do that all the time.
p23
aVAs a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas
p24
aVcome from mistakes and tricks of the eye.
p25
aVBecause I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,
p26
aVso many clothes out there.
p27
aVAnd the only ones that look interesting to me
p28
aVare the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,
p29
aVor very, very surprising.
p30
aVAnd often, I'm driving in a taxi
p31
aVand I see a hole in a shirt, or something
p32
aVthat looks very interesting or pretty or functional
p33
aVin some way that I'd never seen happen before.
p34
aVAnd so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,
p35
aVand see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,
p36
aVit was a shadow, you know.
p37
aVOr if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,
p38
aVthere was actually someone thought of that thought already.
p39
aVSomeone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.
p40
aa(lp41
VI don't know where inspiration comes from.
p42
aVIt does not come for me from research.
p43
aVI don't get necessarily inspired by research.
p44
aVAs a matter of fact, one of the most fun things
p45
aVI've ever, ever done in my whole life,
p46
aVwas this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.
p47
aVI read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.
p48
aVAnd I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.
p49
aVAnd I saw this really smart critic who I love.
p50
aVThis woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,
p51
aVand she came backstage and she said,
p52
aVoh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism
p53
aVand talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.
p54
aVAnd I said, how do I know about Stalinism?
p55
aVI know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,
p56
aVhe ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,
p57
aVyou hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I don't really know that. I don't really \u2014
p60
aVactually I do my own kind of research, you know.
p61
aVIf I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,
p62
aVI will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,
p63
aVnot because it's what I'm supposed to do.
p64
aVI'm very, very, very inspired by movies.
p65
aVThe color of movies and the way light makes the colors,
p66
aVlight from behind the projection,
p67
aVor light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.
p68
aVAnd anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.
p69
aVI sit up at night and I watch movies
p70
aVand I watch women in movies a lot.
p71
aVAnd I think about, you know, their roles,
p72
aVand about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.
p73
aVBecause I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.
p74
aVWhether they're kind of glorified in this way,
p75
aVor whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,
p76
aVor whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.
p77
aa(lp78
VI go back to color all the time.
p79
aVColor is something that motivates me a lot.
p80
aVIt's rarely color that I find in nature,
p81
aValthough, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,
p82
aVnatural color is so beautiful.
p83
aVSo that's what I do. I study color a lot.
p84
aVBut for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything
p85
aVthat is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?
p86
aVHow can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?
p87
aVI mean, that's just not possible, you know.
p88
aVAnd so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.
p89
aVI want to show you \u2014 I'm also like a big \u2014
p90
aVI go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,
p91
aVand that's another thing that motivates me a lot.
p92
aVPeople say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.
p93
aVSo I do it.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VWhen I was about 21, an astrologer told me
p97
aVthat I was going to meet the man of my dreams,
p98
aVand that his name was going to be Eric, right?
p99
aVSo, you know, for years I would go to bars
p100
aVand, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric
p101
aVI was humping immediately, or something.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVAnd there were times when I was actually so desperate
p104
aVI would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"
p105
aVAnd anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.
p108
aVThe last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny
p109
aVwas this guy on like a straw boater with a cane
p110
aVand you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?
p111
aVI want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing
p112
aVwhere I do a cabaret act.
p113
aVSo actually, check this out.
p114
aVVery embarrassing.
p115
aV(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe name of the show is based on this story
p118
aVthat I have to tell you about my mother.
p119
aVIt's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.
p120
aVI was dating this guy, right?
p121
aVAnd this has to do with being happy, I swear.
p122
aVI was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.
p123
aVAnd we were getting serious,
p124
aVso we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.
p125
aVAnd we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.
p126
aVMy mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,
p127
aVwho it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.
p128
aVYou know, homosexuality, right?
p129
aVSo my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,
p130
aV"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.
p131
aVThey eat out, they see shows."
p132
aVThey eat out, they see shows.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVThat's the name of the show, they eat out, they \u2014
p135
aVthat's on my tombstone when I die.
p136
aV"He ate out, he saw shows," right?
p137
aa(lp138
VSo in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity
p139
aVto edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.
p140
aVSo you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.
p141
aVBecause it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...
p142
aVI don't know how to put this.
p143
aVI feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.
p144
aVAnd at least, you know, in my case,
p145
aVbecause if I just do one thing all the time,
p146
aVI don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.
p147
aVAnd you know, I don't say that I do everything well,
p148
aVI just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.
p149
aVAnd I kind of try not to look back, you know.
p150
aVExcept, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.
p151
aVLike, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.
p152
aVBut I guess that's okay. Right?
p153
aVBecause if you do many things
p154
aVyou get to feel lousy about everything,
p155
aVand not just one, you know.
p156
aVYou don't master feeling lousy about one thing.
p157
aVYeah, exactly.
p158
aa(lp159
VI will show you this next thing,
p160
aVspeaking of costumes for operas.
p161
aVI do work with different choreographers.
p162
aVI work with Twyla Tharp a lot,
p163
aVand I work with Mark Morris a lot,
p164
aVwho is one of my best friends.
p165
aVAnd I designed three operas with him,
p166
aVand the most recent one, "King Arthur."
p167
aVI'd been very ingrained in the dance world
p168
aVsince I was a teenager.
p169
aVI went to performing arts high school,
p170
aVwhere I was an actor.
p171
aVAnd many of my friends were ballet dancers.
p172
aVAgain, I don't know where inspiration comes from.
p173
aVI don't know where it comes from.
p174
aVI started making puppets when I was a kid.
p175
aVMaybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.
p176
aVAnd then performing arts high school.
p177
aVThere I was in high school,
p178
aVmeeting dancers and acting.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd somehow, from there, I got interested in design.
p181
aVI went to Parsons School of Design
p182
aVand then I began my career as a designer.
p183
aVI don't really think of myself as a designer,
p184
aVI don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.
p185
aVAnd frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.
p186
aVI think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.
p187
aVIt's just that.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVBut I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,
p190
aVthat is what \u2014 I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.
p191
aVYou always have to be slightly bored with everything.
p192
aVAnd if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VBut I am really a little bored with everything.
p196
aVI always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything \u2014
p197
aVshe books everything and she makes everything happen.
p198
aVAnd she makes all the deals.
p199
aVAnd I always tell her that I find myself
p200
aVwith a lot of time on the computer bridge program.
p201
aVToo much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's
p202
aVso ... somehow, like, about ten years ago
p203
aVI thought that the most unboring place in the world
p204
aVwould be like a T.V. studio,
p205
aVlike for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.
p206
aVBecause it's all of these things that I love
p207
aVall kind of in one place.
p208
aVAnd if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,
p209
aVand do another thing and talk about it, right?
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd so I had this T.V. show.
p212
aVAnd that was a very, very, very big part of my process.
p213
aVActually, could you roll the clip, please?
p214
aVThis is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.
p217
aVHi there.
p218
aa(lp219
VRosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.
p220
aa(lp221
VIM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.
p222
aa(lp223
VMan: Her grandmother says, "Delish!"
p224
aa(lp225
VIM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?
p226
aVI want to stay out of the way.
p227
aVI don't want to be \u2014 okay. Here we go.
p228
aVDo you get nervous, Ashleigh?
p229
aa(lp230
VAshleigh: Doing what?
p231
aVROD: Cutting hair.
p232
aa(lp233
VA: Cutting hair? Never, never.
p234
aVI don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.
p235
aVIM: You look so cute already, by the way.
p236
aVROD: You like it? All right.
p237
aVIM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.
p238
aa(lp239
VROD: Of course I want to look cute.
p240
aVIM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,
p241
aVaggressively ugly.
p242
aa(lp243
VROD: No, not me, no.
p244
aa(lp245
VIM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money
p246
aVand they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,
p247
aVreally messed up, you know what I mean?
p248
aVAnd there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.
p249
aVBecause just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,
p250
aVdoes that mean you shouldn't have kids,
p251
aVbecause you know they're going to end up getting messed up?
p252
aa(lp253
VROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be
p254
aVtheir well-being first, I think.
p255
aVBut you have to make the decision for yourself.
p256
aVMy kids are seven, who the hell knows.
p257
aVThey're going to be like 14 and in rehab.
p258
aVAnd they're going to be playing this clip:
p259
aV"I'm such a good mother."
p260
aVMy God, this is the shortest I've ever had.
p261
aa(lp262
VIM: It looks good, yeah?
p263
aa(lp264
VA: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been \u2014
p265
aa(lp266
VROD: No! It's all right \u2014 go crazy.
p267
aa(lp268
VIM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.
p269
aa(lp270
VA: Oh no, we're just staging,
p271
aa(lp272
VROD: We're just staging it.
p273
aa(lp274
VIM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.
p275
aa(lp276
VROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.
p277
aa(lp278
VIM: Oh, it's so fabulous!
p279
aa(lp280
VROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!
p281
aa(lp282
VIM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.
p283
aVI mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.
p284
aVThat is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.
p285
aVActually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,
p286
aV"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."
p287
aVRight? And then I realized, that was on my website,
p288
aVand then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me
p289
aVand I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.
p290
aVI forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
p291
aa(lp292
VI want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.
p293
aVI'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.
p294
aVAnd I often look at things as though they're food.
p295
aVLike I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?
p296
aVThen how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.
p297
aVHow could you show a beat up old dress?
p298
aVI always relate things to kitchen-ry.
p299
aVAnd so I think that's what it all boils down to.
p300
aVEverything boils down to that.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo check this out.
p303
aVThis is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.
p304
aVIt's, like, this website.
p305
aVIt's got a lot of different things on it.
p306
aVIt's a polymathematical website.
p307
aVWe actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.
p308
aVAnd it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.
p309
aVAnd it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?
p310
aVAnd again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?
p311
aVAnd here is the last bit.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.
p314
aa(lp315
VChef: Do you?
p316
aa(lp317
VIM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.
p318
aa(lp319
VChef: Oh.
p320
aa(lp321
VIM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.
p322
aa(lp323
VChef: You can't?
p324
aVIM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.
p325
aa(lp326
VChef: No, but that's all it is.
p327
aVIM: Is that all it is?
p328
aa(lp329
VChef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.
p330
aVLet me tell you something interesting.
p331
aa(lp332
VIM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.
p333
aVJust because I don't know that whole \u2014 that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.
p334
aVSorry, what?
p335
aa(lp336
VChef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.
p337
aVIn the old days when they used to make butter,
p338
aVyou know how you make butter?
p339
aa(lp340
VIM: Churns?
p341
aa(lp342
VChef: For cream?
p343
aa(lp344
VIM: Yeah, exactly.
p345
aa(lp346
VChef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,
p347
aVand you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.
p348
aVThe liquid is actually that clear liquid.
p349
aVIf you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,
p350
aVit's actually buttermilk.
p351
aVAnd that's what it was in the early days.
p352
aVAnd that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.
p353
aVNow, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.
p354
aa(lp355
VIM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?
p356
aa(lp357
VChef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.
p358
aa(lp359
VIM: Yeah, it is, exactly.
p360
aVSo who would think that it was low-fat?
p361
aa(lp362
VWell, that's it. Thank you very much.
p363
aVHappy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.
p364
aVThanks. Bye.
