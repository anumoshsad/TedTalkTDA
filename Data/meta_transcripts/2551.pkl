VWe are stealing nature from our children.
p4
aVNow, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature
p5
aVthat they will have wanted us to preserve,
p6
aValthough that is unfortunately also the case.
p7
aVWhat I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way
p8
aVthat's so purist and so strict
p9
aVthat under the definition we're creating for ourselves,
p10
aVthere won't be any nature left for our children
p11
aVwhen they're adults.
p12
aVBut there's a fix for this.
p13
aVSo let me explain.
p14
aa(lp15
VRight now, humans use half of the world
p16
aVto live, to grow their crops and their timber,
p17
aVto pasture their animals.
p18
aVIf you added up all the human beings,
p19
aVwe would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together.
p20
aVWe cut roads through the forest.
p21
aVWe have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches.
p22
aVWe've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers.
p23
aVAnd of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air.
p24
aVSo when you take your next breath,
p25
aVyou'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide
p26
aVthan if you were breathing in 1750.
p27
aVSo all of these changes, and many others,
p28
aVhave come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."
p29
aVAnd this is a term that some geologists are suggesting
p30
aVwe should give to our current epoch,
p31
aVgiven how pervasive human influence has been over it.
p32
aVNow, it's still just a proposed epoch, but I think it's a helpful way
p33
aVto think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo where does this put nature?
p36
aVWhat counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans?
p37
aa(lp38
VSo 25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McKibben said
p39
aVthat because nature was a thing apart from man
p40
aVand because climate change meant
p41
aVthat every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man,
p42
aVthen nature was over.
p43
aVIn fact, he called his book "The End of Nature."
p44
aa(lp45
VI disagree with this. I just disagree with this.
p46
aVI disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundamentally, we are animals.
p47
aVRight? Like, we evolved on this planet
p48
aVin the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet,
p49
aVand all the other plants, and all the other microbes.
p50
aVAnd so I think that nature
p51
aVis not that which is untouched by humanity, man or woman.
p52
aVI think that nature is anywhere where life thrives,
p53
aVanywhere where there are multiple species together,
p54
aVanywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life
p55
aVand growing.
p56
aVAnd under that definition,
p57
aVthings look a little bit different.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature
p60
aVthat speak to us in a special way.
p61
aVPlaces like Yellowstone,
p62
aVor the Mongolian steppe,
p63
aVor the Great Barrier Reef
p64
aVor the Serengeti.
p65
aVPlaces that we think of as kind of Edenic representations
p66
aVof a nature before we screwed everything up.
p67
aVAnd in a way, they are less impacted by our day to day activities.
p68
aVMany of these places have no roads or few roads,
p69
aVso on, like such.
p70
aVBut ultimately, even these Edens are deeply influenced by humans.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, let's just take North America, for example,
p73
aVsince that's where we're meeting.
p74
aVSo between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here,
p75
aVthey started a process of interacting with the nature
p76
aVthat led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals,
p77
aVfrom the mastodon to the giant ground sloth,
p78
aVsaber-toothed cats,
p79
aVall of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us.
p80
aVAnd when those animals went extinct,
p81
aVyou know, the ecosystems didn't stand still.
p82
aVMassive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests,
p83
aVchanged the composition of forest from one tree to another.
p84
aVSo even in these Edens,
p85
aVeven in these perfect-looking places
p86
aVthat seem to remind us of a past before humans,
p87
aVwe're essentially looking at a humanized landscape.
p88
aVNot just these prehistoric humans, but historical humans, indigenous people
p89
aVall the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up.
p90
aVAnd the case is the same for the other continents as well.
p91
aVHumans have just been involved in nature
p92
aVin a very influential way for a very long time.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, just recently, someone told me,
p95
aa(lp96
V"Oh, but there are still wild places."
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd he said, "The Amazon."
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I was like, "Oh, the Amazon. I was just there.
p103
aVIt's awesome. National Geographic sent me to Manú National Park,
p104
aVwhich is in the Peruvian Amazon,
p105
aVbut it's a big chunk of rainforest, uncleared, no roads,
p106
aVprotected as a national park,
p107
aVone of the most, in fact, biodiverse parks in the world.
p108
aVAnd when I got in there with my canoe, what did I find, but people.
p109
aVPeople have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years.
p110
aVPeople live there, and they don't just float over the jungle.
p111
aVThey have a meaningful relationship with the landscape.
p112
aVThey hunt. They grow crops.
p113
aVThey domesticate crops.
p114
aVThey use the natural resources to build their houses,
p115
aVto thatch their houses.
p116
aVThey even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals.
p117
aVThese people are there
p118
aVand they're interacting with the environment
p119
aVin a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, I was with an anthropologist on this trip,
p122
aVand he told me, as we were floating down the river,
p123
aVhe said, "There are no demographic voids in the Amazon."
p124
aVThis statement has really stuck with me,
p125
aVbecause what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this.
p126
aVThere's people everywhere.
p127
aVAnd many other tropical forests are the same,
p128
aVand not just tropical forests.
p129
aVPeople have influenced ecosystems in the past,
p130
aVand they continue to influence them in the present,
p131
aVeven in places where they're harder to notice.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, if all of the definitions of nature that we might want to use
p134
aVthat involve it being untouched by humanity
p135
aVor not having people in it,
p136
aVif all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature,
p137
aVthen maybe they're the wrong definitions.
p138
aVMaybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species,
p139
aVby the presence of a thriving life.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, if we do it that way,
p142
aVwhat do we get?
p143
aVWell, it's this kind of miracle.
p144
aVAll of a sudden, there's nature all around us.
p145
aVAll of a sudden, we see this Monarch caterpillar
p146
aVmunching on this plant,
p147
aVand we realize that there it is,
p148
aVand it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
p149
aVAnd look at this empty lot.
p150
aVI mean, there's, like, probably,
p151
aVa dozen, minimum, plant species growing there,
p152
aVsupporting all kinds of insect life,
p153
aVand this is a completely unmanaged space, a completely wild space.
p154
aVThis is a kind of wild nature right under our nose,
p155
aVthat we don't even notice.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd there's an interesting little paradox, too.
p158
aVSo this nature,
p159
aVthis kind of wild, untended part
p160
aVof our urban, peri-urban, suburban agricultural existence
p161
aVthat flies under the radar,
p162
aVit's arguably more wild than a national park,
p163
aVbecause national parks are very carefully managed
p164
aVin the 21st century.
p165
aVCrater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest national park,
p166
aVis a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past.
p167
aVBut they're managing it carefully.
p168
aVOne of the issues they have now is white bark pine die-off.
p169
aVWhite bark pine is a beautiful, charismatic \u2014
p170
aVI'll say it's a charismatic megaflora
p171
aVthat grows up at high altitude \u2014
p172
aVand it's got all these problems right now with disease.
p173
aVThere's a blister rust that was introduced,
p174
aVbark beetle.
p175
aVSo to deal with this, the park service has been planting
p176
aVrust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park,
p177
aVeven in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness.
p178
aVAnd they're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas
p179
aVas I saw last time I went hiking there.
p180
aVAnd this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think.
p181
aVNational parks are heavily managed.
p182
aVThe wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure.
p183
aVFires are suppressed.
p184
aVFires are started.
p185
aVNon-native species are removed.
p186
aVNative species are reintroduced.
p187
aVAnd in fact, I took a look,
p188
aVand Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed:
p189
aVsuppressing fire, having fire,
p190
aVradio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison.
p191
aVIt takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
V(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd in a further irony, these places that we love the most
p198
aVare the places that we love a little too hard, sometimes.
p199
aVA lot of us like to go there,
p200
aVand because we're managing them to be stable
p201
aVin the face of a changing planet,
p202
aVthey often are becoming more fragile over time.
p203
aa(lp204
VWhich means that they're the absolute worst places
p205
aVto take your children on vacation,
p206
aVbecause you can't do anything there.
p207
aVYou can't climb the trees.
p208
aVYou can't fish the fish.
p209
aVYou can't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere.
p210
aVYou can't take home the pinecones.
p211
aVThere are so many rules and restrictions
p212
aVthat from a child's point of view,
p213
aVthis is, like, the worst nature ever.
p214
aVBecause children don't want to hike
p215
aVthrough a beautiful landscape for five hours
p216
aVand then look at a beautiful view.
p217
aVThat's maybe what we want to do as adults,
p218
aVbut what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot
p219
aVand just tinker with it, just work with it,
p220
aVjust pick it up, build a house, build a fort, do something like that.
p221
aa(lp222
VAdditionally, these sort of Edenic places
p223
aVare often distant from where people live.
p224
aVAnd they're expensive to get to. They're hard to visit.
p225
aVSo this means that they're only available to the elites,
p226
aVand that's a real problem.
p227
aVThe Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people,
p228
aVand they asked them, how often do you spend time outdoors?
p229
aVAnd only two out of five spent time outdoors
p230
aVat least once a week.
p231
aVThe other three out of five were just staying inside.
p232
aVAnd when they asked them why, what are the barriers to going outside,
p233
aVthe response of 61 percent was,
p234
aV"There are no natural areas near my home."
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd this is crazy. This is just patently false.
p237
aVI mean, 71 percent of people in the US
p238
aVlive within a 10-minute walk of a city park.
p239
aVAnd I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries.
p240
aVAnd that doesn't even count your back garden,
p241
aVthe urban creek, the empty lot.
p242
aVEverybody lives near nature.
p243
aVEvery kid lives near nature.
p244
aVWe've just somehow forgotten how to see it.
p245
aVWe've spent too much time watching David Attenborough documentaries
p246
aVwhere the nature is really sexy \u2014
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
Vand we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door,
p251
aVthe nature of the street tree.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo here's an example: Philadelphia.
p254
aVThere's this cool elevated railway
p255
aVthat you can see from the ground, that's been abandoned.
p256
aVNow, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan,
p257
aVand it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet,
p258
aValthough they're working on it.
p259
aVSo for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness
p260
aVin the heart of Philadelphia,
p261
aVand if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence,
p262
aVyou can scramble up to the top
p263
aVand you can find this completely wild meadow
p264
aVjust floating above the city of Philadelphia.
p265
aVEvery single one of these plants grew from a seed
p266
aVthat planted itself there.
p267
aVThis is completely autonomous, self-willed nature.
p268
aVAnd it's right in the middle of the city.
p269
aVAnd they've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys,
p270
aVand there are over 50 plant species up there.
p271
aVAnd it's not just plants.
p272
aVThis is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem.
p273
aVIt's creating soil. It's sequestering carbon.
p274
aVThere's pollination going on.
p275
aVI mean, this is really an ecosystem.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"
p278
aVbecause they're often dominated by non-native species,
p279
aVand because they're just super weird.
p280
aVThey're just unlike anything we've ever seen before.
p281
aVFor so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash.
p282
aVWe're talking about regrown agricultural fields,
p283
aVtimber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis,
p284
aVsecond-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast,
p285
aVwhere after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up.
p286
aVAnd of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,
p287
aVwhere novel ecosystems are the norm,
p288
aVwhere exotic species totally dominate.
p289
aVThis forest here has Queensland maple,
p290
aVit has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.
p291
aVYou can make your own novel ecosystem, too.
p292
aVIt's really simple.
p293
aVYou just stop mowing your lawn.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VIlkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland, and he did this experiment himself.
p298
aVHe just stopped mowing his lawn,
p299
aVand after a few years, he had some grad students come,
p300
aVand they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard,
p301
aVand they found 375 plant species,
p302
aVincluding two endangered species.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo when you're up there on that future High Line of Philadelphia,
p305
aVsurrounded by this wildness,
p306
aVsurrounded by this diversity, this abundance, this vibrance,
p307
aVyou can look over the side
p308
aVand you can see a local playground for a local school,
p309
aVand that's what it looks like.
p310
aVThese children have, that \u2014
p311
aVYou know, under my definition,
p312
aVthere's a lot of the planet that counts as nature,
p313
aVbut this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature.
p314
aVThere's nothing there except humans, no other plants, no other animals.
p315
aVAnd what I really wanted to do
p316
aVwas just, like, throw a ladder over the side
p317
aVand get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow.
p318
aVIn a way, I feel like this is the choice that faces us.
p319
aVIf we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good,
p320
aVwe might as well just pave them over.
p321
aVAnd in a world where everything is changing,
p322
aVwe need to be very careful about how we define nature.
p323
aa(lp324
VIn order not to steal it from our children,
p325
aVwe have to do two things.
p326
aVFirst, we cannot define nature as that which is untouched.
p327
aVThis never made any sense anyway.
p328
aVNature has not been untouched for thousands of years.
p329
aVAnd it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit
p330
aVand have a relationship with,
p331
aVincluding only nature that children cannot touch.
p332
aVWhich brings me to the second thing that we have to do,
p333
aVwhich is that we have to let children touch nature,
p334
aVbecause that which is untouched is unloved.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VWe face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet.
p339
aVClimate change is among them.
p340
aVThere's others too: habitat loss is my favorite thing
p341
aVto freak out about in the middle of the night.
p342
aVBut in order to solve them,
p343
aVwe need people \u2014 smart, dedicated people \u2014
p344
aVwho care about nature.
p345
aVAnd the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people
p346
aVwho care about nature
p347
aVis by letting them touch nature.
p348
aa(lp349
VI have a Fort Theory of Ecology,
p350
aVFort Theory of Conservation.
p351
aVEvery ecologist I know, every conservation biologist I know,
p352
aVevery conservation professional I know,
p353
aVbuilt forts when they were kids.
p354
aVIf we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a fort,
p355
aVwe'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd I don't want to be the one to tell this kid,
p358
aVwho is on a special program
p359
aVthat takes Philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods
p360
aVand takes them to city parks,
p361
aVI don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding
p362
aVis a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash.
p363
aVI think I would much rather learn from this boy
p364
aVthat no matter where this plant comes from,
p365
aVit is beautiful, and it deserves to be touched and appreciated.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.
