VOur grandparents' generation created an amazing system
p4
aVof canals and reservoirs that made it possible
p5
aVfor people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water.
p6
aVFor example, during the Great Depression,
p7
aVthey created the Hoover Dam,
p8
aVwhich in turn, created Lake Mead
p9
aVand made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix
p10
aVand Los Angeles to provide water
p11
aVfor people who lived in a really dry place.
p12
aa(lp13
VIn the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars
p14
aVbuilding infrastructure to get water to our cities.
p15
aVIn terms of economic development, it was a great investment.
p16
aVBut in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects
p17
aVof climate change, population growth and competition for water resources
p18
aVthreaten these vital lifelines and water resources.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead
p21
aVthat happened in the last 15 years.
p22
aVYou can see starting around the year 2000,
p23
aVthe lake level started to drop.
p24
aVAnd it was dropping at such a rate
p25
aVthat it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.
p26
aVThe city became so concerned about this
p27
aVthat they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure
p28
aVthat they referred to as the "Third Straw"
p29
aVto pull water out of the greater depths of the lake.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe challenges associated with providing water to a modern city
p32
aVare not restricted to the American Southwest.
p33
aVIn the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane,
p34
aVcame within 6 months of running out of water.
p35
aVA similar drama is playing out today in São Paulo, Brazil,
p36
aVwhere the main reservoir for the city
p37
aVhas gone from being completely full in 2010,
p38
aVto being nearly empty today
p39
aVas the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics.
p40
aa(lp41
VFor those of us who are fortunate enough
p42
aVto live in one of the world's great cities,
p43
aVwe've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought.
p44
aVWe like to complain about the navy showers we have to take.
p45
aVWe like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns.
p46
aVBut we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap
p47
aVand having nothing come out.
p48
aVAnd that's because when things have gotten bad in the past,
p49
aVit's always been possible to expand a reservoir
p50
aVor dig a few more groundwater wells.
p51
aVWell, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for,
p52
aVit's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way
p53
aVof providing ourselves with water.
p54
aa(lp55
VSome people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem
p56
aVby taking water from our rural neighbors.
p57
aVBut that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.
p58
aVAnd even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors,
p59
aVwe're just transferring the problem to someone else
p60
aVand there's a good chance it will come back and bite us
p61
aVin the form of higher food prices
p62
aVand damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.
p63
aa(lp64
VI think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis
p65
aVand I think that's to open up four new local sources of water
p66
aVthat I liken to faucets.
p67
aVIf we can make smart investments in these new sources of water
p68
aVin the coming years,
p69
aVwe can solve our urban water problem
p70
aVand decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across
p71
aVthe effects of a catastrophic drought.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, if you told me 20 years ago
p74
aVthat a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water,
p75
aVI probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.
p76
aVBut my own experiences
p77
aVworking with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades
p78
aVhave shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills
p79
aVto actually transition away from imported water,
p80
aVand that's what I want to tell you about tonight.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe first source of local water supply that we need to develop
p83
aVto solve our urban water problem
p84
aVwill flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities.
p85
aVOne of the great tragedies of urban development
p86
aVis that as our cities grew,
p87
aVwe started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt.
p88
aVAnd when we did that, we had to build storm sewers
p89
aVto get the water that fell on the cities out
p90
aVbefore it could cause flooding,
p91
aVand that's a waste of a vital water resource.
p92
aVLet me give you an example.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis figure here shows you the volume of water
p95
aVthat could be collected in the city of San Jose
p96
aVif they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits.
p97
aVYou can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line
p98
aVthat if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city,
p99
aVthey'd have enough water to get them through an entire year.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, I know what some of you are probably thinking.
p102
aV"The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks
p103
aVand attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters,
p104
aVrainwater harvesting."
p105
aVNow, that's an idea that might work in some places.
p106
aVBut if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time
p107
aVand most of the water demand is in the summertime,
p108
aVit's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem.
p109
aVAnd if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought,
p110
aVlike California's currently experiencing,
p111
aVyou just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem.
p112
aa(lp113
VI think there's a lot more practical way
p114
aVto harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities,
p115
aVand that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground.
p116
aVAfter all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system
p117
aVthat can accommodate huge volumes of water.
p118
aa(lp119
VFor example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained
p120
aVabout a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer
p121
aVthat underlies the San Fernando Valley.
p122
aVNow, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof
p123
aVand runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter,
p124
aVyou might say to yourself, "Do I really want to drink that stuff?"
p125
aVWell, the answer is you don't want to drink it
p126
aVuntil it's been treated a little bit.
p127
aVAnd so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting
p128
aVis to capture the water, clean the water
p129
aVand get it underground.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing
p132
aVwith a new project that they're building in Burbank, California.
p133
aVThis figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building
p134
aVby hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers,
p135
aVand routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry.
p136
aVThe water that's captured in the quarry
p137
aVis slowly passed through a man-made wetland,
p138
aVand then it goes into that ball field there
p139
aVand percolates into the ground,
p140
aVrecharging the drinking water aquifer of the city.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd in the process of passing through the wetland
p143
aVand percolating through the ground,
p144
aVthe water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants
p145
aVand the surfaces of the soil,
p146
aVand that purifies the water.
p147
aVAnd if the water's still not clean enough to drink
p148
aVafter it's been through this natural treatment process,
p149
aVthe city can treat it again
p150
aVwhen they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers
p151
aVbefore they deliver it to people to drink.
p152
aa(lp153
VThe second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem
p154
aVwill flow with the wastewater
p155
aVthat comes out of our sewage treatment plants.
p156
aVNow, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water.
p157
aVYou've probably seen signs like this
p158
aVthat tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median
p159
aVand the local golf course
p160
aVis being watered with water
p161
aVthat used to be in a sewage treatment plant.
p162
aVWe've been doing this for a couple of decades now.
p163
aVBut what we're learning from our experience
p164
aVis that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be.
p165
aVBecause once we build the first few water recycling systems
p166
aVclose to the sewage treatment plant,
p167
aVwe have to build longer and longer pipe networks
p168
aVto get that water to where it needs to go.
p169
aVAnd that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat we're finding is
p172
aVthat a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater
p173
aVis to turn treated wastewater into drinking water
p174
aVthrough a two-step process.
p175
aVIn the first step in this process we pressurize the water
p176
aVand pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane:
p177
aVa thin, permeable plastic membrane
p178
aVthat allows water molecules to pass through
p179
aVbut traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals
p180
aVthat might be present in the wastewater.
p181
aa(lp182
VIn the second step in the process,
p183
aVwe add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide
p184
aVand shine ultraviolet light on the water.
p185
aVThe ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide
p186
aVinto two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals,
p187
aVand these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen
p188
aVthat break down most organic chemicals.
p189
aa(lp190
VAfter the water's been through this two-stage process,
p191
aVit's safe to drink.
p192
aVI know,
p193
aVI've been studying recycled water
p194
aVusing every measurement technique known to modern science
p195
aVfor the past 15 years.
p196
aVWe've detected some chemicals
p197
aVthat can make it through the first step in the process,
p198
aVbut by the time we get to the second step,
p199
aVthe advanced oxidation process,
p200
aVwe rarely see any chemicals present.
p201
aVAnd that's in stark contrast to the taken-for-granted water supplies
p202
aVthat we regularly drink all the time.
p203
aa(lp204
VThere's another way we can recycle water.
p205
aVThis is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built
p206
aVon the Santa Ana River in Southern California.
p207
aVThe treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River
p208
aVthat in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent
p209
aVfrom cities like Riverside and San Bernardino.
p210
aVThe water comes into our treatment wetland,
p211
aVit's exposed to sunlight and algae
p212
aVand those break down the organic chemicals,
p213
aVremove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
p214
aVThe water gets put back in the Santa Ana River,
p215
aVit flows down to Anaheim,
p216
aVgets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground,
p217
aVand becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim,
p218
aVcompleting the trip from the sewers of Riverside County
p219
aVto the drinking water supply of Orange County.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater
p222
aVis some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done.
p223
aVWell, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year
p224
aVof wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process
p225
aVI was telling you about.
p226
aVThat's enough water to be the supply of about a million people
p227
aVif it were their sole water supply.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all,
p230
aVit will be a kind of virtual tap,
p231
aVit will be the water conservation that we manage to do.
p232
aVAnd the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors
p233
aVbecause in California and other modern American cities,
p234
aVabout half of our water use happens outdoors.
p235
aa(lp236
VIn the current drought,
p237
aVwe've seen that it's possible
p238
aVto have our lawns survive and our plants survive
p239
aVwith about half as much water.
p240
aVSo there's no need to start painting concrete green
p241
aVand putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses.
p242
aVWe can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors
p243
aVand smart irrigation controllers
p244
aVand have beautiful green landscapes in our cities.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe fourth and final water tap that we need to open up
p247
aVto solve our urban water problem
p248
aVwill flow with desalinated seawater.
p249
aVNow, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.
p250
aV"It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water
p251
aVand you don't care about climate change."
p252
aVSeawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it.
p253
aVBut that characterization of seawater desalination
p254
aVas being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date.
p255
aVWe've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination
p256
aVin the past two decades.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis picture shows you
p259
aVthe largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere
p260
aVthat's currently being built north of San Diego.
p261
aVCompared to the seawater desalination plant
p262
aVthat was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago,
p263
aVthis treatment plant will use about half the energy
p264
aVto produce a gallon of water.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive,
p267
aVdoesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere.
p268
aVAmong the different choices we have,
p269
aVit's probably the most energy-intensive
p270
aVand potentially environmentally damaging
p271
aVof the options to create a local water supply.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo there it is.
p274
aVWith these four sources of water,
p275
aVwe can move away from our reliance on imported water.
p276
aVThrough reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties,
p277
aVwe can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent,
p278
aVthereby increasing  the water supply by 25 percent.
p279
aVWe can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer,
p280
aVthereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent.
p281
aVAnd we can make up the difference through a combination
p282
aVof stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, let's create a water supply
p285
aVthat will be able to withstand any of the challenges
p286
aVthat climate change throws at us in the coming years.
p287
aVLet's create a water supply that uses local sources
p288
aVand leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food.
p289
aVLet's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values.
p290
aVAnd let's do it for our children and our grandchildren
p291
aVand let's tell them this is the system
p292
aVthat they have to take care of in the future
p293
aVbecause it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.
p294
