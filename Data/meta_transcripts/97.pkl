VWhen you have 21 minutes to speak,
p4
aVtwo million years seems like a really long time.
p5
aVBut evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.
p6
aVAnd yet in two million years,
p7
aVthe human brain has nearly tripled in mass,
p8
aVgoing from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,
p9
aVto the almost three-pound meatloaf
p10
aVthat everybody here has between their ears.
p11
aVWhat is it about a big brain
p12
aVthat nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, it turns out when brains triple in size,
p15
aVthey don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.
p16
aVAnd one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part,
p17
aVcalled the "frontal lobe."
p18
aVParticularly, a part called the "pre-frontal cortex."
p19
aVWhat does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify
p20
aVthe entire architectural overhaul of the human skull
p21
aVin the blink of evolutionary time?
p22
aa(lp23
VIt turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things,
p24
aVbut one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator.
p25
aVPilots practice in flight simulators
p26
aVso that they don't make real mistakes in planes.
p27
aVHuman beings have this marvelous adaptation
p28
aVthat they can actually have experiences in their heads
p29
aVbefore they try them out in real life.
p30
aVThis is a trick that none of our ancestors could do,
p31
aVand that no other animal can do quite like we can.
p32
aVIt's a marvelous adaptation.
p33
aVIt's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language
p34
aVas one of the things that got our species out of the trees
p35
aVand into the shopping mall.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAll of you have done this.
p40
aVBen and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream,
p41
aVand it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."
p42
aVIt's because, without leaving your armchair,
p43
aVyou can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.
p44
aa(lp45
VLet's see how your experience simulators are working.
p46
aVLet's just run a quick diagnostic
p47
aVbefore I proceed with the rest of the talk.
p48
aVHere's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.
p49
aVYou can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.
p50
aVOne of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.
p51
aVAnd the other is becoming paraplegic.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VJust give it a moment of thought.
p56
aVYou probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.
p57
aa(lp58
VInterestingly, there are data on these two groups of people,
p59
aVdata on how happy they are.
p60
aVAnd this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
p61
aVBut these aren't the data. I made these up!
p62
aa(lp63
VThese are the data.
p64
aVYou failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.
p65
aVBecause the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs,
p66
aVand a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics
p67
aVare equally happy with their lives.
p68
aa(lp69
VDon't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz,
p70
aVbecause everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.
p71
aVThe research that my laboratory has been doing,
p72
aVthat economists and psychologists around the country have been doing,
p73
aVhas revealed something really quite startling to us,
p74
aVsomething we call the "impact bias,"
p75
aVwhich is the tendency for the simulator to work badly.
p76
aVFor the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes
p77
aVare more different than in fact they really are.
p78
aa(lp79
VFrom field studies to laboratory studies,
p80
aVwe see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner,
p81
aVgetting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test,
p82
aVon and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration
p83
aVthan people expect them to have.
p84
aVThis almost floors me \u2014
p85
aVa recent study showing how major life traumas affect people
p86
aVsuggests that if it happened over three months ago,
p87
aVwith only a few exceptions,
p88
aVit has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.
p89
aa(lp90
VWhy?
p91
aVBecause happiness can be synthesized.
p92
aVSir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.
p93
aVI have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity.
p94
aVI am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."
p95
aVWhat kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.
p98
aVHuman beings have something
p99
aVthat we might think of as a "psychological immune system."
p100
aVA system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes,
p101
aVthat help them change their views of the world,
p102
aVso that they can feel better
p103
aVabout the worlds in which they find themselves.
p104
aVLike Sir Thomas, you have this machine.
p105
aVUnlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.
p106
aa(lp107
VWe synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.
p108
aVNow, you don't need me to give you
p109
aVtoo many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect.
p110
aVThough I'm going to show you some experimental evidence,
p111
aVyou don't have to look very far for evidence.
p112
aVI took a copy of the New York Times
p113
aVand tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.
p114
aVHere are three guys synthesizing happiness.
p115
aV"I'm better off physically, financially, mentally ...
p116
aV"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."
p117
aV"I believe it turned out for the best."
p118
aa(lp119
VWho are these characters who are so damn happy?
p120
aVThe first one is Jim Wright.
p121
aVSome of you are old enough to remember:
p122
aVhe was the chairman of the House of Representatives
p123
aVand he resigned in disgrace
p124
aVwhen this young Republican named Newt Gingrich
p125
aVfound out about a shady book deal he had done.
p126
aVHe lost everything.
p127
aVThe most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything.
p128
aVHe lost his money, he lost his power.
p129
aVWhat does he have to say all these years later?
p130
aV"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally
p131
aVand in almost every other way."
p132
aVWhat other way would there be to be better off?
p133
aVVegetably? Minerally? Animally?
p134
aVHe's pretty much covered them there.
p135
aa(lp136
VMoreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of.
p137
aVMoreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.
p138
aVHe was 78 years old.
p139
aVHe'd spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary
p140
aVfor a crime he didn't commit.
p141
aV[He was ultimately released
p142
aVfor good behavior halfway through his sentence.]
p143
aVWhat did he say about his experience?
p144
aV"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience." Glorious!
p145
aVHe is not saying,
p146
aV"Well, there were some nice guys. They had a gym."
p147
aV"Glorious,"
p148
aVa word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.
p149
aa(lp150
VHarry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known
p151
aVbut didn't, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper
p152
aVabout a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds.
p153
aVAnd he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"
p154
aVSo he went to find them. They said,
p155
aV"We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."
p156
aVHarry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker,
p157
aVto loan him the $3,000, and his brother's immortal words were,
p158
aV"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."
p159
aVHe wouldn't lend him the money,
p160
aVand of course, six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.
p161
aVIt turns out people do eat hamburgers,
p162
aVand Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd then, finally,
p165
aVsome of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best,
p166
aVwho was the original drummer for the Beatles,
p167
aVuntil they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away
p168
aVand picked up Ringo on a tour.
p169
aVWell, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed \u2014
p170
aVyes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician \u2014
p171
aVhe had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."
p172
aa(lp173
VOkay. There's something important to be learned from these people,
p174
aVand it is the secret of happiness.
p175
aVHere it is, finally to be revealed.
p176
aVFirst: accrue wealth, power, and prestige, then lose it.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VSecond: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThird: make somebody else really, really rich.
p185
aVAnd finally: never ever join the Beatles.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aVYeah, right.
p189
aVBecause when people synthesize happiness,
p190
aVas these gentlemen seem to have done,
p191
aVwe all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say,
p192
aV"Yeah right, you never really wanted the job."
p193
aV"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her,
p194
aVand you figured that out just about the time
p195
aVshe threw the engagement ring in your face."
p196
aVWe smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness
p197
aVis not of the same quality as what we might call "natural happiness."
p198
aa(lp199
VWhat are these terms?
p200
aVNatural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted,
p201
aVand synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted.
p202
aVAnd in our society, we have a strong belief
p203
aVthat synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhy do we have that belief?
p206
aVWell, it's very simple.
p207
aVWhat kind of economic engine would keep churning
p208
aVif we believed that not getting what we want
p209
aVcould make us just as happy as getting it?
p210
aVWith all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard,
p211
aVa shopping mall full of Zen monks
p212
aVis not going to be particularly profitable,
p213
aVbecause they don't want stuff enough.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VI want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness
p218
aVis every bit as real and enduring
p219
aVas the kind of happiness you stumble upon
p220
aVwhen you get exactly what you were aiming for.
p221
aVI'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric,
p222
aVbut by marinating you in a little bit of data.
p223
aa(lp224
VLet me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used
p225
aVto demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks.
p226
aVAnd this isn't mine.
p227
aVIt's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."
p228
aVIt's very simple.
p229
aVYou bring in, say, six objects,
p230
aVand you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.
p231
aVIn this case, because this experiment uses them,
p232
aVthese are Monet prints.
p233
aVSo, everybody can rank these Monet prints
p234
aVfrom the one they like the most, to the one they like the least.
p235
aVNow we give you a choice:
p236
aV"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.
p237
aVWe're going to give you one as your prize to take home.
p238
aVWe happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject.
p239
aVThis is a bit of a difficult choice,
p240
aVbecause neither one is preferred strongly to the other,
p241
aVbut naturally, people tend to pick number three
p242
aVbecause they liked it a little better than number four.
p243
aa(lp244
VSometime later \u2014 it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days \u2014
p245
aVthe same stimuli are put before the subject,
p246
aVand the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.
p247
aV"Tell us how much you like them now."
p248
aVWhat happens?
p249
aVWatch as happiness is synthesized.
p250
aVThis is the result that has been replicated over and over again.
p251
aVYou're watching happiness be synthesized.
p252
aVWould you like to see it again?
p253
aVHappiness!
p254
aV"The one I got is really better than I thought!
p255
aVThat other one I didn't get sucks!"
p256
aVThat's the synthesis of happiness.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, what's the right response to that?
p261
aV"Yeah, right!"
p262
aVNow, here's the experiment we did,
p263
aVand I hope this is going to convince you
p264
aVthat "Yeah, right!" was not the right response.
p265
aa(lp266
VWe did this experiment with a group of patients
p267
aVwho had anterograde amnesia.
p268
aVThese are hospitalized patients.
p269
aVMost of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,
p270
aVa polyneuritic psychosis.
p271
aVThey drank way too much, and they can't make new memories.
p272
aVOK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself,
p273
aVand then leave the room,
p274
aVwhen you come back, they don't know who you are.
p275
aa(lp276
VWe took our Monet prints to the hospital.
p277
aVAnd we asked these patients to rank them
p278
aVfrom the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.
p279
aVWe then gave them the choice between number three and number four.
p280
aVLike everybody else, they said,
p281
aV"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print.
p282
aVI'll take number three."
p283
aVWe explained we would have number three mailed to them.
p284
aVWe gathered up our materials and we went out of the room,
p285
aVand counted to a half hour.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VBack into the room, we say, "Hi, we're back."
p290
aVThe patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,
p291
aVI've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here.
p292
aVIf I've met you before, I don't remember."
p293
aV"Really, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?"
p294
aV"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."
p295
aV"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me
p296
aVfrom the one you like the most to the one you like the least."
p297
aa(lp298
VWhat do they do?
p299
aVWell, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac.
p300
aVWe ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own,
p301
aVwhich one they chose last time, which one is theirs.
p302
aVAnd what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.
p303
aVThese are normal controls, where if I did this with you,
p304
aVall of you would know which print you chose.
p305
aVBut if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue.
p306
aVThey can't pick their print out of a lineup.
p307
aa(lp308
VHere's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness.
p309
aVRight? This is the change in liking score,
p310
aVthe change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.
p311
aVNormal controls show \u2014 that was the magic I showed you;
p312
aVnow I'm showing it to you in graphical form \u2014
p313
aV"The one I own is better than I thought.
p314
aVThe one I didn't own, the one I left behind,
p315
aVis not as good as I thought."
p316
aVAmnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.
p317
aa(lp318
VThese people like better the one they own,
p319
aVbut they don't know they own it.
p320
aV"Yeah, right" is not the right response!
p321
aVWhat these people did when they synthesized happiness
p322
aVis they really, truly changed
p323
aVtheir affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.
p324
aVThey're not just saying it because they own it,
p325
aVbecause they don't know they own it.
p326
aa(lp327
VWhen psychologists show you bars,
p328
aVyou know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.
p329
aVAnd yet, all of us have this psychological immune system,
p330
aVthis capacity to synthesize happiness,
p331
aVbut some of us do this trick better than others.
p332
aVAnd some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively
p333
aVthan other situations do.
p334
aVIt turns out that freedom,
p335
aVthe ability to make up your mind and change your mind,
p336
aVis the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose
p337
aVamong all those delicious futures
p338
aVand find the one that you would most enjoy.
p339
aVBut freedom to choose,
p340
aVto change and make up your mind,
p341
aVis the enemy of synthetic happiness.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows, of course.
p344
aV"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?"
p345
aV"My printer prints a blank page after every document."
p346
aV"Why complain about getting free paper?"
p347
aV"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"
p348
aV"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper!
p349
aVOnly a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"
p350
aV"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"
p351
aV"What are you doing?"
p352
aV"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe psychological immune system works best
p355
aVwhen we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.
p356
aVThis is the difference between dating and marriage.
p357
aVYou go out on a date with a guy,
p358
aVand he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.
p359
aVYou're married to a guy and he picks his nose?
p360
aVHe has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake!
p361
aVYou find a way to be happy with what's happened.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VNow, what I want to show you
p366
aVis that people don't know this about themselves,
p367
aVand not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.
p368
aa(lp369
VHere's an experiment we did at Harvard.
p370
aVWe created a black-and-white photography course,
p371
aVand we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.
p372
aVSo we gave them cameras; they went around campus;
p373
aVthey took 12 pictures of their favorite professors
p374
aVand their dorm room and their dog,
p375
aVand all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.
p376
aVThey bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet;
p377
aVthey figure out which are the two best pictures;
p378
aVand we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms.
p379
aVAnd they blow two of them up,
p380
aVand they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies
p381
aVof meaningful things to them, and we say,
p382
aV"Which one would you like to give up?"
p383
aV"I have to give one up?"
p384
aV"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project.
p385
aVSo you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.
p386
aVYou get to keep one, and I get to keep one."
p387
aa(lp388
VNow, there are two conditions in this experiment.
p389
aVIn one case, the students are told,
p390
aV"But you know, if you want to change your mind,
p391
aVI'll always have the other one here,
p392
aVand in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters" \u2014
p393
aVYeah, "headquarters" \u2014
p394
aV"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.
p395
aVIn fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email.
p396
aVBetter yet, I'll check with you.
p397
aVYou ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable."
p398
aVThe other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:
p399
aV"Make your choice, and by the way,
p400
aVthe mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.
p401
aVYour picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.
p402
aVYou will never see it again."
p403
aVHalf of the students in each of these conditions
p404
aVare asked to make predictions
p405
aVabout how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep
p406
aVand the picture they leave behind.
p407
aVOther students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms
p408
aVand they are measured over the next three to six days
p409
aVon their liking, satisfaction with the pictures.
p410
aVAnd look at what we find.
p411
aa(lp412
VFirst of all, here's what students think is going to happen.
p413
aVThey think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose
p414
aVa little more than the one they left behind,
p415
aVbut these are not statistically significant differences.
p416
aVIt's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter
p417
aVwhether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.
p418
aa(lp419
VWrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening.
p420
aVBoth right before the swap and five days later,
p421
aVpeople who are stuck with that picture,
p422
aVwho have no choice,
p423
aVwho can never change their mind,
p424
aVlike it a lot!
p425
aVAnd people who are deliberating \u2014 "Should I return it?
p426
aVHave I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn't the good one?
p427
aVMaybe I left the good one?" \u2014 have killed themselves.
p428
aVThey don't like their picture,
p429
aVand in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired,
p430
aVthey still don't like their picture.
p431
aVWhy?
p432
aVBecause the [reversible] condition is not conducive

VSo here's the final piece of this experiment.
p436
aVWe bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students
p437
aVand we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course,
p438
aVand we can do it one of two ways.
p439
aVWe could do it so that when you take the two pictures,
p440
aVyou'd have four days to change your mind,
p441
aVor we're doing another course where you take the two pictures
p442
aVand you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.
p443
aVWhich course would you like to be in?" Duh!
p444
aV66 percent of the students, two-thirds,
p445
aVprefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.
p446
aVHello? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course
p447
aVin which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture.
p448
aVBecause they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.

VThe Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here
p451
aVbut he's making it hyperbolically:
p452
aV"'Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so."
p453
aVIt's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.
p454
aVIs there really nothing good or bad?
p455
aVIs it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris
p456
aVare just the same thing?
p457
aV(Laughter)
p458
aVThat seems like a one-question IQ test.
p459
aVThey can't be exactly the same.
p460
aa(lp461
VIn more turgid prose, but closer to the truth,
p462
aVwas the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.
p463
aVThis is worth contemplating:
p464
aV"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life
p465
aVseems to arise from overrating the difference
p466
aVbetween one permanent situation and another \u2014
p467
aVSome of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others,
p468
aVbut none of them can deserve to be pursued
p469
aVwith that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules
p470
aVeither of prudence or of justice,
p471
aVor to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds,
p472
aVeither by shame from the remembrance of our own folly,
p473
aVor by remorse for the horror of our own injustice."
p474
aVIn other words: yes, some things are better than others.
p475
aa(lp476
VWe should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.
p477
aVBut when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast
p478
aVbecause we have overrated the difference between these futures,
p479
aVwe are at risk.
p480
aVWhen our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully.
p481
aVWhen our ambition is unbounded,
p482
aVit leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others,
p483
aVto sacrifice things of real value.
p484
aVWhen our fears are bounded,
p485
aVwe're prudent, we're cautious,
p486
aVwe're thoughtful.
p487
aVWhen our fears are unbounded and overblown,
p488
aVwe're reckless, and we're cowardly.
p489
aa(lp490
VThe lesson I want to leave you with, from these data,
p491
aVis that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown,
p492
aVbecause we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity
p493
aVwe are constantly chasing when we choose experience.
