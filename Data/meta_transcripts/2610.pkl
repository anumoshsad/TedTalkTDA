VI want to start by doing an experiment.
p4
aVI'm going to play three videos of a rainy day.
p5
aVBut I've replaced the audio of one of the videos,
p6
aVand instead of the sound of rain,
p7
aVI've added the sound of bacon frying.
p8
aVSo I want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Rain falls)
p11
aa(lp12
V(Rain falls)
p13
aa(lp14
V(Rain falls)
p15
aa(lp16
VAll right.
p17
aVActually, I lied.
p18
aVThey're all bacon.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Bacon sizzles)
p21
aa(lp22
V(Applause)
p23
aa(lp24
VMy point here isn't really to make you hungry
p25
aVevery time you see a rainy scene,
p26
aVbut it's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies.
p27
aVWe're not looking for accuracy.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo on the subject of deception,
p30
aVI wanted to quote one of my favorite authors.
p31
aVIn "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde establishes the idea
p32
aVthat all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic;
p33
aVand all great art comes from lying and deceiving,
p34
aVand telling beautiful, untrue things.
p35
aVSo when you're watching a movie
p36
aVand a phone rings,
p37
aVit's not actually ringing.
p38
aVIt's been added later in postproduction in a studio.
p39
aVAll of the sounds you hear are fake.
p40
aVEverything, apart from the dialogue,
p41
aVis fake.
p42
aVWhen you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Wings flap)
p45
aa(lp46
VThey haven't really recorded the bird.
p47
aVIt sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet
p48
aVor shaking kitchen gloves.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Flaps)
p51
aa(lp52
VThe burning of a cigarette up close \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Cigarette burns)
p55
aa(lp56
VIt actually sounds a lot more authentic
p57
aVif you take a small Saran Wrap ball
p58
aVand release it.
p59
aa(lp60
V(A Saran Warp ball being released)
p61
aa(lp62
VPunches?
p63
aa(lp64
V(Punch)
p65
aa(lp66
VOops, let me play that again.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Punch)
p69
aa(lp70
VThat's often done by sticking a knife in vegetables,
p71
aVusually cabbage.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)
p74
aa(lp75
VThe next one \u2014 it's breaking bones.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Bones break)
p78
aa(lp79
VWell, no one was really harmed.
p80
aVIt's actually ...
p81
aVbreaking celery or frozen lettuce.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VMaking the right sounds is not always as easy
p88
aVas a trip to the supermarket
p89
aVand going to the vegetable section.
p90
aVBut it's often a lot more complicated than that.
p91
aVSo let's reverse-engineer together
p92
aVthe creation of a sound effect.
p93
aa(lp94
VOne of my favorite stories comes from Frank Serafine.
p95
aVHe's a contributor to our library,
p96
aVand a great sound designer for "Tron" and "Star Trek" and others.
p97
aVHe was part of the Paramount team that won the Oscar for best sound
p98
aVfor "The Hunt for Red October."
p99
aVIn this Cold War classic, in the '90s,
p100
aVthey were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine.
p101
aVSo they had a small problem:
p102
aVthey couldn't really find a submarine in West Hollywood.
p103
aVSo basically, what they did is,
p104
aVthey went to a friend's swimming pool,
p105
aVand Frank performed a cannonball, or bomba.
p106
aVThey placed an underwater mic
p107
aVand an overhead mic outside the swimming pool.
p108
aVSo here's what the underwater mic sounds like.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Underwater plunge)
p111
aa(lp112
VAdding the overhead mic,
p113
aVit sounded a bit like this:
p114
aa(lp115
V(Water splashes)
p116
aa(lp117
VSo now they took the sound and pitched it one octave down,
p118
aVsort of like slowing down a record.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Water splashes at lower octave)
p121
aVAnd then they removed a lot of the high frequencies.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Water splashes)
p124
aVAnd pitched it down another octave.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Water splashes at lower octave)
p127
aVAnd then they added a little bit of the splash
p128
aVfrom the overhead microphone.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Water splashes)
p131
aVAnd by looping and repeating that sound,
p132
aVthey got this:
p133
aa(lp134
V(Propeller churns)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion
p137
aVthat we're inside the submarine.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut once you've created your sounds
p140
aVand you've synced them to the image,
p141
aVyou want those sounds to live in the world of the story.
p142
aVAnd one the best ways to do that is to add reverb.
p143
aVSo this is the first audio tool I want to talk about.
p144
aVReverberation, or reverb, is the persistence of the sound
p145
aVafter the original sound has ended.
p146
aVSo it's sort of like the \u2014
p147
aVall the reflections from the materials,
p148
aVthe objects and the walls around the sound.
p149
aa(lp150
VTake, for example, the sound of a gunshot.
p151
aVThe original sound is less than half a second long.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Gunshot)
p154
aVBy adding reverb,
p155
aVwe can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)
p158
aVOr like it was recorded inside a chapel or a church.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Gunshot reverbs church)
p161
aa(lp162
VOr in a canyon.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)
p165
aa(lp166
VSo reverb gives us a lot of information
p167
aVabout the space between the listener and the original sound source.
p168
aVIf the sound is the taste,
p169
aVthen reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut reverb can do a lot more.
p172
aVListening to a sound with a lot less reverberation
p173
aVthan the on-screen action
p174
aVis going to immediately signify to us
p175
aVthat we're listening to a commentator,
p176
aVto an objective narrator that's not participating in the on-screen action.
p177
aVAlso, emotionally intimate moments in cinema
p178
aVare often heard with zero reverb,
p179
aVbecause that's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear.
p180
aa(lp181
VOn the completely other side,
p182
aVadding a lot of reverb to a voice
p183
aVis going to make us think that we're listening to a flashback,
p184
aVor perhaps that we're inside the head of a character
p185
aVor that we're listening to the voice of God.
p186
aVOr, even more powerful in film,
p187
aVMorgan Freeman.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VSo \u2014
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VBut what are some other tools or hacks
p196
aVthat sound designers use?
p197
aVWell, here's a really big one.
p198
aVIt's silence.
p199
aVA few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention.
p200
aVAnd in the Western world,
p201
aVwe're not really used to verbal silences.
p202
aVThey're considered awkward or rude.
p203
aVSo silence preceding verbal communication
p204
aVcan create a lot of tension.
p205
aVBut imagine a really big Hollywood movie,
p206
aVwhere it's full of explosions and automatic guns.
p207
aVLoud stops being loud anymore, after a while.
p208
aVSo in a yin-yang way,
p209
aVsilence needs loudness and loudness needs silence
p210
aVfor either of them to have any effect.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut what does silence mean?
p213
aVWell, it depends how it's used in each film.
p214
aVSilence can place us inside the head of a character
p215
aVor provoke thought.
p216
aVWe often relate silences with ...
p217
aVcontemplation,
p218
aVmeditation,
p219
aVbeing deep in thought.
p220
aVBut apart from having one meaning,
p221
aVsilence becomes a blank canvas
p222
aVupon which the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut I want to make it clear: there is no such thing as silence.
p225
aVAnd I know this sounds like the most pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
p226
aVBut even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation
p227
aVand zero external sounds,
p228
aVyou would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood.
p229
aVAnd in cinema, traditionally, there was never a silent moment
p230
aVbecause of the sound of the projector.
p231
aVAnd even in today's Dolby world,
p232
aVthere's not really any moment of silence if you listen around you.
p233
aVThere's always some sort of noise.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow, since there's no such thing as silence,
p236
aVwhat do filmmakers and sound designers use?
p237
aVWell, as a synonym, they often use ambiences.
p238
aVAmbiences are the unique background sounds
p239
aVthat are specific to each location.
p240
aVEach location has a unique sound,
p241
aVand each room has a unique sound,
p242
aVwhich is called room tone.
p243
aVSo here's a recording of a market in Morocco.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Voices, music)
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd here's a recording of Times Square in New York.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)
p250
aa(lp251
VRoom tone is the addition of all the noises inside the room:
p252
aVthe ventilation, the heating, the fridge.
p253
aVHere's a recording of my apartment in Brooklyn.
p254
aa(lp255
V(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler, the fridge and street traffic)
p256
aa(lp257
VAmbiences work in a most primal way.
p258
aVThey can speak directly to our brain subconsciously.
p259
aVSo, birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality,
p260
aVperhaps because, as a species,
p261
aVwe've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Birds chirp)
p264
aVOn the other hand, industrial sounds have been introduced to us
p265
aVa little more recently.
p266
aVEven though I really like them personally \u2014
p267
aVthey've been used by one of my heroes, David Lynch,
p268
aVand his sound designer, Alan Splet \u2014
p269
aVindustrial sounds often carry negative connotations.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Machine noises)
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, sound effects can tap into our emotional memory.
p274
aVOccasionally, they can be so significant
p275
aVthat they become a character in a movie.
p276
aVThe sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Thunder)
p279
aa(lp280
VChurch bells can remind us of the passing of time,
p281
aVor perhaps our own mortality.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Bells ring)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship
p286
aVor a friendship.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Glass breaks)
p289
aa(lp290
VScientists believe that dissonant sounds,
p291
aVfor example, brass or wind instruments played very loud,
p292
aVmay remind us of animal howls in nature
p293
aVand therefore create a sense of irritation or fear.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Brass and wind instruments play)
p296
aa(lp297
VSo now we've spoken about on-screen sounds.
p298
aVBut occasionally, the source of a sound cannot be seen.
p299
aVThat's what we call offscreen sounds,
p300
aVor "acousmatic."
p301
aVAcousmatic sounds \u2014
p302
aVwell, the term "acousmatic" comes from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,
p303
aVwho used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years,
p304
aVnot revealing himself to his disciples.
p305
aVI think the mathematician and philosopher thought that,
p306
aVin that way,
p307
aVhis students might focus more on the voice,
p308
aVand his words and its meaning,
p309
aVrather than the visual of him speaking.
p310
aVSo sort of like the Wizard of Oz,
p311
aVor "1984's" Big Brother,
p312
aVseparating the voice from its source,
p313
aVseparating cause and effect
p314
aVsort of creates a sense of ubiquity or panopticism,
p315
aVand therefore, authority.
p316
aa(lp317
VThere's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound.
p318
aVNuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice used to sing in rooms
p319
aVup in galleries close to the ceiling,
p320
aVcreating the illusion that we're listening to angels up in the sky.
p321
aVRichard Wagner famously created the hidden orchestra
p322
aVthat was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience.
p323
aVAnd one of my heroes, Aphex Twin, famously hid in dark corners of clubs.
p324
aa(lp325
VI think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source,
p326
aVyou create a sense of mystery.
p327
aVThis has been seen in cinema over and over,
p328
aVwith Hitchcock, and Ridley Scott in "Alien."
p329
aVHearing a sound without knowing its source
p330
aVis going to create some sort of tension.
p331
aVAlso, it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have
p332
aVand can show something that wasn't there during filming.
p333
aVAnd if all this sounds a little theoretical,
p334
aVI wanted to play a little video.
p335

V(Saw cuts)
p349
aa(lp350
V(Woman screams)
p351
aa(lp352
VWhat I'm sort of trying to demonstrate with these tools
p353
aVis that sound is a language.
p354
aVIt can trick us by transporting us geographically;
p355
aVit can change the mood;
p356
aVit can set the pace;
p357
aVit can make us laugh or it can make us scared.
p358
aa(lp359
VOn a personal level, I fell in love with that language
p360
aVa few years ago,
p361
aVand somehow managed to make it into some sort of profession.
p362
aVAnd I think with our work through the sound library,
p363
aVwe're trying to kind of expand the vocabulary of that language.
p364
aVAnd in that way, we want to offer the right tools
p365
aVto sound designers,
p366
aVfilmmakers,
p367
aVand video game and app designers,
p368
aVto keep telling even better stories
p369
aVand creating even more beautiful lies.
p370
