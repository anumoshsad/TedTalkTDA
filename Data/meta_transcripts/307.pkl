VI and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others,
p4
aVhave put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.
p5
aV17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped,
p6
aVand we're just starting our third experiment:
p7
aVstudying people who report that they're still in love
p8
aVafter 10 to 25 years of marriage.
p9
aVSo, this is the short story of that research.
p10
aa(lp11
VIn the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
p12
aVIt was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city-state,
p13
aVof the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.
p14
aVHis name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
p15
aVHe stood over six feet tall.
p16
aVHe lived into his 80s,
p17
aVand he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.
p18
aVAnd Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.
p19
aVSo, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.
p20
aVAnd every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox,
p21
aVthe sun rises behind his temple,
p22
aVand perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.
p23
aVAnd as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon,
p24
aVit perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.
p25
aVAfter 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
p26
aa(lp27
VAround the world, people love.
p28
aVThey sing for love, they dance for love,
p29
aVthey compose poems and stories about love.
p30
aVThey tell myths and legends about love.
p31
aVThey pine for love, they live for love, they kill for love, and they die for love.
p32
aVAs Walt Whitman once said, "O I would stake all for you."
p33
aVAnthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.
p34
aVThey've never found a society that did not have it.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut love isn't always a happy experience.
p37
aVIn one study of college students, they asked a lot of questions about love,
p38
aVbut the two that stood out to me the most were:
p39
aV"Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"
p40
aVAnd the second question was:
p41
aV"Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"
p42
aVAnd almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.
p43
aVAlmost nobody gets out of love alive.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, before I start telling you about the brain,
p46
aVI want to read for you
p47
aVwhat I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.
p48
aVThere's other love poems that are, of course, just as good,
p49
aVbut I don't think this one can be surpassed.
p50
aVIt was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska
p51
aVto a missionary in 1896.
p52
aVAnd here it is.
p53
aVI've never had the opportunity to say it before.
p54
aV"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.
p55
aVPain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.
p56
aVPain like a boil about to burst with my love for you,
p57
aVconsumed by fire with my love for you.
p58
aVI remember what you said to me.
p59
aVI am thinking of your love for me.
p60
aVI am torn by your love for me.
p61
aVPain and more pain \u2014
p62
aVwhere are you going with my love?
p63
aVI am told you will go from here.
p64
aVI am told you will leave me here.
p65
aVMy body is numb with grief.
p66
aVRemember what I said, my love.
p67
aVGoodbye, my love, goodbye."
p68
aVEmily Dickinson once wrote, "Parting is all we need to know of hell."
p69
aVHow many people have suffered
p70
aVin all the millions of years of human evolution?
p71
aVHow many people around the world
p72
aVare dancing with elation at this very minute?
p73
aVRomantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain
p76
aVand study this madness.
p77
aVOur first study of people who were happily in love
p78
aVhas been widely publicized,
p79
aVso I'm only going to say very little about it.
p80
aVWe found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain
p81
aVcalled the ventral tegmental area.
p82
aVWe found activity in some cells called the A10 cells,
p83
aVcells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant,
p84
aVand spray it to many brain regions.
p85
aVIndeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.
p86
aVIt's way below your cognitive thinking process.
p87
aVIt's below your emotions.
p88
aVIt's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,
p89
aVassociated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.
p90
aVIn fact, the same brain region where we found activity
p91
aVbecomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut romantic love is much more than a cocaine high \u2014
p94
aVat least you come down from cocaine.
p95
aVRomantic love is an obsession, it possesses you.
p96
aVYou lose your sense of self.
p97
aVYou can't stop thinking about another human being.
p98
aVSomebody is camping in your head.
p99
aVAs an eighth-century Japanese poet said, "My longing had no time when it ceases."
p100
aVWild is love.
p101
aVAnd the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientists on our project,
p104
aVare looking at the data of the people
p105
aVwho were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.
p106
aVIt was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine,
p107
aVbecause they were in such bad shape.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.
p112
aVWe found activity in the brain region,
p113
aVin exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love.
p114
aVWhat a bad deal.
p115
aVYou know, when you've been dumped,
p116
aVthe one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being,
p117
aVand then go on with your life \u2014 but no, you just love them harder.
p118
aVAs the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said,
p119
aVhe said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."
p120
aVAnd indeed, we now know why.
p121
aVTwo thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.
p122
aVThat brain system \u2014 the reward system
p123
aVfor wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus \u2014
p124
aVbecomes more active when you can't get what you want.
p125
aVIn this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mating partner.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe found activity in other brain regions also \u2014
p128
aVin a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.
p129
aVYou're lying there, you're looking at the picture,
p130
aVand you're in this machine,
p131
aVand you're calculating what went wrong.
p132
aVWhat have I lost?
p133
aVAs a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
p134
aVIt comes from a David Mamet play,
p135
aVand there's two con artists in the play,
p136
aVand the woman is conning the man,
p137
aVand the man looks at the woman and says,
p138
aV"Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."
p139
aVAnd indeed, it's this part of the brain,
p140
aVthe core of the nucleus accumbens,
p141
aVthat is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses.
p142
aVIt's also the brain region that becomes active
p143
aVwhen you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses.
p144
aa(lp145
VLast but not least, we found activity in a brain region
p146
aVassociated with deep attachment to another individual.
p147
aVNo wonder people suffer around the world, and we have so many crimes of passion.
p148
aVWhen you've been rejected in love,
p149
aVnot only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love,
p150
aVbut you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.
p151
aVMoreover, this brain circuit for reward is working,
p152
aVand you're feeling intense energy, intense focus, intense motivation
p153
aVand the willingness to risk it all, to win life's greatest prize.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, what have I learned from this experiment
p156
aVthat I would like to tell the world?
p157
aVForemost, I have come to think
p158
aVthat romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.
p159
aVNot the sex drive \u2014
p160
aVthe sex drive gets you looking for a whole range of partners.
p161
aVRomantic love enables you to focus your mating energy
p162
aVon just one at a time, conserve your mating energy,
p163
aVand start the mating process with this single individual.
p164
aVI think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love,
p165
aVwhat sums it up best is something that is said by Plato
p166
aVover 2,000 years ago.
p167
aVHe said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.
p168
aVIt is a need, it is an urge, it is a homeostatic imbalance.
p169
aVLike hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."
p170
aVI've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction:
p171
aVa perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well,
p172
aVand a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.
p175
aVYou focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,
p176
aVyou crave them, you distort reality,
p177
aVyour willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.
p178
aVAnd it's got the three main characteristics of addiction:
p179
aVtolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more;
p180
aVwithdrawals;
p181
aVand last: relapse.
p182
aVI've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.
p183
aVIt's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.
p184
aVAnd she was driving along in her car the other day,
p185
aVand suddenly she heard a song on the car radio
p186
aVthat reminded her of this man.
p187
aVNot only did the instant craving come back,
p188
aVbut she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.
p189
aVSo, one thing I would like the medical community,
p190
aVand the legal community, and even the college community,
p191
aVto see if they can understand, that indeed, romantic love
p192
aVis one of the most addictive substances on Earth.
p193
aa(lp194
VI would also like to tell the world that animals love.
p195
aVThere's not an animal on this planet
p196
aVthat will copulate with anything that comes along.
p197
aVToo old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won't do it.
p198
aVUnless you're stuck in a laboratory cage \u2014
p199
aVand you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box,
p200
aVyou're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with,
p201
aVbut I've looked in a hundred species,
p202
aVand everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.
p203
aVAs a matter of fact, ethologists know this.
p204
aVThere are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"
p205
aVselective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.
p206
aVAnd indeed, there are now three academic articles
p207
aVin which they've looked at this attraction,
p208
aVwhich may only last for a second,
p209
aVbut it's a definite attraction,
p210
aVand either this same brain region, this reward system,
p211
aVor the chemicals of that reward system are involved.
p212
aVIn fact, I think animal attraction can be instant \u2014
p213
aVyou can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.
p214
aVAnd I think that this is really the origin
p215
aVof what you and I call "love at first sight."
p216
aa(lp217
VPeople have often asked me
p218
aVwhether what I know about love has spoiled it for me.
p219
aVAnd I just simply say, "Hardly."
p220
aVYou can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake,
p221
aVand then when you sit down and eat that cake,
p222
aVyou can still feel that joy.
p223
aVAnd certainly, I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too,
p224
aVbut it's really deepened my understanding
p225
aVand compassion, really, for all human life.
p226
aVAs a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself
p227
aVlooking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.
p228
aVAnd in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry
p229
aVfor the chicken on my dinner plate,
p230
aVwhen I think of how intense this brain system is.
p231
aVOur newest experiment has been hatched
p232
aVby my colleague, Art Aron \u2014
p233
aVputting people who are reporting that they are still in love,
p234
aVin a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.
p235
aVWe've put five people in so far,
p236
aVand indeed, we found exactly the same thing.
p237
aVThey're not lying.
p238
aVThe brain areas associated with intense romantic love
p239
aVstill become active, 25 years later.
p240
aa(lp241
VThere are still many questions to be answered
p242
aVand asked about romantic love.
p243
aVThe question that I'm working on right this minute \u2014
p244
aVand I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end \u2014
p245
aVis, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?
p246
aVI never would have even thought to think of this,
p247
aVbut Match.com, the Internet dating site,
p248
aVcame to me three years ago and asked me that question.
p249
aVAnd I said, I don't know.
p250
aVI know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love,
p251
aVbut I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another.
p252
aVAnd so, I've spent the last three years on this.
p253
aVAnd there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person
p254
aVrather than another, that psychologists can tell you.
p255
aVAnd we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background,
p256
aVthe same general level of intelligence, of good looks, the same religious values.
p257
aVYour childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.
p258
aVAnd that's about it, that's all they know.
p259
aVNo, they've never found
p260
aVthe way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, it began to occur to me
p263
aVthat maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another.
p264
aVAnd I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree
p265
aVyou express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.
p266
aVI think we've evolved four very broad personality types
p267
aVassociated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.
p268
aVAnd on this dating site that I have created, called Chemistry.com,
p269
aVI ask you first a series of questions
p270
aVto see to what degree you express these chemicals,
p271
aVand I'm watching who chooses who to love.
p272
aVAnd 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.
p273
aVAbout 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.
p274
aVI'm putting the data together now,
p275
aVand at some point \u2014 there will always be magic to love,
p276
aVbut I think I will come closer to understanding
p277
aVwhy it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background,
p278
aVyour same general level of intelligence, good looks,
p279
aVand you don't feel pulled towards all of them.
p280
aVI think there's biology to that.
p281
aVI think we're going to end up, in the next few years,
p282
aVto understand all kinds of brain mechanisms
p283
aVthat pull us to one person rather than another.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo, I will close with this.
p286
aVThese are my older people.
p287
aVFaulkner said, "The past is not dead, it's not even past."
p288
aVIndeed, we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain.
p289
aVAnd so, there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature,
p290
aVand this reminds me of it.
p291
aVThese are two women.
p292
aVWomen tend to get intimacy differently than men do.
p293
aVWomen get intimacy from face-to-face talking.
p294
aVWe swivel towards each other,
p295
aVwe do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.
p296
aVThis is intimacy to women.
p297
aVI think it comes from millions of years
p298
aVof holding that baby in front of your face,
p299
aVcajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
p300
aVMen tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.
p301
aVAs soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VI think it comes from millions of years sitting behind the bush,
p306
aVlooking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
p307
aVI think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies,
p308
aVthey sat side-by-side with friends.
p309
aVSo my final statement is: love is in us.
p310
aVIt's deeply embedded in the brain.
p311
aVOur challenge is to understand each other.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you.
