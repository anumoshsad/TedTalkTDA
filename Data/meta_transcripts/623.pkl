VI'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems
p4
aVand how it can be solved.
p5
aa(lp6
VI'd like to start with a little experiment.
p7
aVCould you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,
p8
aVor you've had laser refractive surgery?
p9
aVNow, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
p10
aVBut it looks like \u2014 I'm guessing \u2014 that it'll be about 60 percent of the room
p11
aVbecause that's roughly the fraction of developed world population
p12
aVthat have some sort of vision correction.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe World Health Organization estimates \u2014
p15
aVwell, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses \u2014
p16
aVthe lowest estimate is 150 million people.
p17
aVThey also have an estimate of around a billion.
p18
aVBut in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,
p19
aVwhich shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear
p20
aVis around half of any population.
p21
aVAnd the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,
p22
aVit's also an educational problem,
p23
aVand it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
p24
aa(lp25
VGlasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.
p26
aVThe problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world
p27
aVto use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear
p28
aVthat we have in the developed world.
p29
aVThere are just way too few eye care professionals.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo this little slide here shows you an optometrist
p32
aVand the little blue person represents about 10,000 people
p33
aVand that's the ratio in the U.K.
p34
aVThis is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
p35
aVIn fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p36
aVwhere there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
p37
aa(lp38
VHow do you do this? How do you solve this problem?
p39
aVI came up with a solution to this problem,
p40
aVand I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
p41
aVAnd the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself
p42
aVand that solves the problem.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhat I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
p45
aVI shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
p46
aVI'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
p47
aVSo \u2014 okay, I can now see that man running out there,
p48
aVand I can see that guy running out there.
p49
aVI've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
p50
aVNext step in my process.
p51
aVSo, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
p52
aVOkay, so I've made these glasses and ...
p53
aVOkay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
p54
aV... I've just ...
p55
aVAnd I've now made some glasses. That's it.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, these aren't the only pair in the world.
p60
aVIn fact, this technology's been evolving.
p61
aVI started working on it in 1985,
p62
aVand it's been evolving very slowly.
p63
aVThere are about 30,000 in use now.
p64
aVAnd they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
p67
aVI have a global vision for vision.
p68
aVAnd that vision is to try to get a billion people
p69
aVwearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
p70
aVTo do that \u2014 this is an early example of the technology.
p71
aVThe technology is being further developed \u2014
p72
aVthe cost has to be brought down.
p73
aVThis pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
p74
aVBut the cost has to be brought right down.
p75
aVIt has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations
p76
aVwho live on a dollar a day.
p77
aa(lp78
VHow do you solve this problem?
p79
aVYou start to get into detail.
p80
aVAnd on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
p81
aVHow do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?
p82
aVHow do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
p83
aVHow do you deal with the industry?
p84
aVAnd the answer to that is research.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World
p87
aVhere in the university.
p88
aVIf you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.
