VI want to talk to you about the future of medicine.
p4
aVBut before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past.
p5
aVNow, throughout much of the recent history of medicine,
p6
aVwe've thought about illness and treatment
p7
aVin terms of a profoundly simple model.
p8
aVIn fact, the model is so simple
p9
aVthat you could summarize it in six words:
p10
aVhave disease, take pill, kill something.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, the reason for the dominance of this model
p13
aVis of course the antibiotic revolution.
p14
aVMany of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating
p15
aVthe hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States.
p16
aVBut what you do know
p17
aVis that that introduction was nothing short of transformative.
p18
aVHere you had a chemical, either from the natural world
p19
aVor artificially synthesized in the laboratory,
p20
aVand it would course through your body,
p21
aVit would find its target,
p22
aVlock into its target \u2014
p23
aVa microbe or some part of a microbe \u2014
p24
aVand then turn off a lock and a key
p25
aVwith exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity.
p26
aVAnd you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease \u2014
p27
aVa pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis \u2014
p28
aVand transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness.
p29
aVYou have a pneumonia,
p30
aVyou take penicillin,
p31
aVyou kill the microbe
p32
aVand you cure the disease.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo seductive was this idea,
p35
aVso potent the metaphor of lock and key
p36
aVand killing something,
p37
aVthat it really swept through biology.
p38
aVIt was a transformation like no other.
p39
aVAnd we've really spent the last 100 years
p40
aVtrying to replicate that model over and over again
p41
aVin noninfectious diseases,
p42
aVin chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease.
p43
aVAnd it's worked, but it's only worked partly.
p44
aVLet me show you.
p45
aVYou know, if you take the entire universe
p46
aVof all chemical reactions in the human body,
p47
aVevery chemical reaction that your body is capable of,
p48
aVmost people think that that number is on the order of a million.
p49
aVLet's call it a million.
p50
aVAnd now you ask the question,
p51
aVwhat number or fraction of reactions
p52
aVcan actually be targeted
p53
aVby the entire pharmacopoeia, all of medicinal chemistry?
p54
aVThat number is 250.
p55
aVThe rest is chemical darkness.
p56
aVIn other words, 0.025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body
p57
aVare actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism.
p58
aVYou know, if you think about human physiology
p59
aVas a vast global telephone network
p60
aVwith interacting nodes and interacting pieces,
p61
aVthen all of our medicinal chemistry
p62
aVis operating on one tiny corner
p63
aVat the edge, the outer edge, of that network.
p64
aVIt's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry
p65
aVis a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas
p66
aVwho is tinkering with about 10 or 15 telephone lines.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo what do we do about this idea?
p69
aVWhat if we reorganized this approach?
p70
aVIn fact, it turns out that the natural world
p71
aVgives us a sense of how one might think about illness
p72
aVin a radically different way,
p73
aVrather than disease, medicine, target.
p74
aVIn fact, the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards,
p75
aVnot downwards, but upwards,
p76
aVand we begin with a self-regulating, semi-autonomous unit called a cell.
p77
aVThese self-regulating, semi-autonomous units
p78
aVgive rise to self-regulating, semi-autonomous units called organs,
p79
aVand these organs coalesce to form things called humans,
p80
aVand these organisms ultimately live in environments,
p81
aVwhich are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme
p84
aVbuilding upwards rather than downwards,
p85
aVis that it allows us to think about illness as well
p86
aVin a somewhat different way.
p87
aVTake a disease like cancer.
p88
aVSince the 1950s,
p89
aVwe've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer.
p90
aVWe've tried to kill cells
p91
aVusing a variety of chemotherapies  or targeted therapies,
p92
aVand as most of us know, that's worked.
p93
aVIt's worked for diseases like leukemia.
p94
aVIt's worked for some forms of breast cancer,
p95
aVbut eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach.
p96
aVAnd it's only in the last 10 years or so
p97
aVthat we've begun to think about using the immune system,
p98
aVremembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum.
p99
aVIt actually grows in a human organism.
p100
aVAnd could you use the organismal capacity,
p101
aVthe fact that human beings have an immune system, to attack cancer?
p102
aVIn fact, it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd finally there's the level of the environment, isn't there?
p105
aVYou know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment.
p106
aVBut let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.
p107
aVIt's called a prison.
p108
aVYou take loneliness, you take depression, you take confinement,
p109
aVand you add to that,
p110
aVrolled up in a little white sheet of paper,
p111
aVone of the most potent neurostimulants that we know, called nicotine,
p112
aVand you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know,
p113
aVand you have a pro-carcinogenic environment.
p114
aVBut you can have anti-carcinogenic environments too.
p115
aVThere are attempts to create milieus,
p116
aVchange the hormonal milieu for breast cancer, for instance.
p117
aVWe're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer.
p118
aa(lp119
VOr take another disease, like depression.
p120
aVAgain, working upwards,
p121
aVsince the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately
p122
aVto turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells \u2014
p123
aVserotonin, dopamine \u2014
p124
aVand tried to cure depression that way,
p125
aVand that's worked, but then that reached the limit.
p126
aVAnd we now know that what you really probably need to do
p127
aVis to change the physiology of the organ, the brain,
p128
aVrewire it, remodel it,
p129
aVand that, of course, we know study upon study has shown
p130
aVthat talk therapy does exactly that,
p131
aVand study upon study has shown that talk therapy
p132
aVcombined with medicines, pills,
p133
aVreally is much more effective than either one alone.
p134
aVCan we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression?
p135
aVCan you lock out the signals that elicit depression?
p136
aVAgain, moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization.
p137
aVWhat's really at stake perhaps here
p138
aVis not the medicine itself but a metaphor.
p139
aVRather than killing something,
p140
aVin the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases \u2014
p141
aVkidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis \u2014
p142
aVmaybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something.
p143
aVAnd that's the key, perhaps,
p144
aVto reframing our thinking about medicine.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, this idea of changing,
p147
aVof creating a perceptual shift, as it were,
p148
aVcame home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago.
p149
aVAbout 10 years ago \u2014 I've been a runner most of my life \u2014
p150
aVI went for a run, a Saturday morning run,
p151
aVI came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move.
p152
aVMy right knee was swollen up,
p153
aVand you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone.
p154
aVAnd one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs.
p155
aVAnd I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that.
p156
aVEssentially, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone
p157
aVhad been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, if you're looking at me and feeling sorry,
p160
aVlet me tell you a few facts.
p161
aVIf I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience,
p162
aV60 percent of you would show signs
p163
aVof bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this.
p164
aV85 percent of all women by the age of 70
p165
aVwould show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration.
p166
aV50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience
p167
aVwould also have such signs.
p168
aVSo this is a very common disease.
p169
aVWell, the second perk of being a physician
p170
aVis that you can get to experiment on your own ailments.
p171
aVSo about 10 years ago we began,
p172
aVwe brought this process into the laboratory,
p173
aVand we began to do simple experiments,
p174
aVmechanically trying to fix this degeneration.
p175
aVWe tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals
p176
aVto try to reverse cartilage degeneration,
p177
aVand to put a short summary on a very long and painful process,
p178
aVessentially it came to naught.
p179
aVNothing happened.
p180
aVAnd then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia.
p181
aVThe nice thing about Australians
p182
aVis that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd so Dan suggested to me, "You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.
p187
aVMaybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem."
p188
aVIn other words, he had two hypotheses.
p189
aVNumber one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell \u2014
p190
aVa skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton,
p191
aVbone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton,
p192
aVjust like there's a stem cell in blood,
p193
aVjust like there's a stem cell in the nervous system.
p194
aVAnd two, that maybe that, the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell
p195
aVis what's causing osteochondral arthritis, a very common ailment.
p196
aVSo really the question was, were we looking for a pill
p197
aVwhen we should have really been looking for a cell.
p198
aVSo we switched our models,
p199
aVand now we began to look for skeletal stem cells.
p200
aVAnd to cut again a long story short,
p201
aVabout five years ago, we found these cells.
p202
aVThey live inside the skeleton.
p203
aVHere's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them.
p204
aVThe white stuff is bone,
p205
aVand these red columns that you see and the yellow cells
p206
aVare cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell \u2014
p207
aVcolumns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell.
p208
aVThese cells are fascinating. They have four properties.
p209
aVNumber one is that they live where they're expected to live.
p210
aVThey live just underneath the surface of the bone,
p211
aVunderneath cartilage.
p212
aVYou know, in biology, it's location, location, location.
p213
aVAnd they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage.
p214
aVThat's one.
p215
aVHere's an interesting property.
p216
aVYou can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton,
p217
aVyou can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory,
p218
aVand they are dying to form cartilage.
p219
aVRemember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money?
p220
aVThese cells are dying to form cartilage.
p221
aVThey form their own furls of cartilage around themselves.
p222
aVThey're also, number three,
p223
aVthe most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered.
p224
aVThis is a little bone, a mouse bone that we fractured
p225
aVand then let it heal by itself.
p226
aVThese stem cells have come in and repaired, in yellow, the bone,
p227
aVin white, the cartilage, almost completely.
p228
aVSo much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye
p229
aVyou can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue
p230
aVcoming into the area of a fracture,
p231
aVfixing it locally and then stopping their work.
p232
aVNow, the fourth one is the most ominous,
p233
aVand that is that their numbers decline precipitously,
p234
aVprecipitously, tenfold, fiftyfold, as you age.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd so what had happened, really,
p237
aVis that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift.
p238
aVWe had gone hunting for pills
p239
aVbut we ended up finding theories.
p240
aVAnd in some ways
p241
aVwe had hooked ourselves back onto this idea:
p242
aVcells, organisms, environments,
p243
aVbecause we were now thinking about bone stem cells,
p244
aVwe were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd then the next question was, are there organs?
p247
aVCan you build this as an organ outside the body?
p248
aVCan you implant cartilage into areas of trauma?
p249
aVAnd perhaps most interestingly,
p250
aVcan you ascend right up and create environments?
p251
aVYou know, we know that exercise remodels bone,
p252
aVbut come on, none of us is going to exercise.
p253
aVSo could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone
p254
aVso that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd perhaps more interesting, and more importantly,
p257
aVthe question is, can you apply this model more globally outside medicine?
p258
aVWhat's at stake, as I said before, is not killing something,
p259
aVbut growing something.
p260
aVAnd it raises a series of, I think, some of the most interesting questions
p261
aVabout how we think about medicine in the future.
p262
aVCould your medicine be a cell and not a pill?
p263
aVHow would we grow these cells?
p264
aVWhat we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells?
p265
aVWe heard about the problems of unleashing growth.
p266
aVCould we implant suicide genes into these cells
p267
aVto stop them from growing?
p268
aVCould your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body
p269
aVand then implanted into the body?
p270
aVCould that stop some of the degeneration?
p271
aVWhat if the organ needed to have memory?
p272
aVIn cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory.
p273
aVHow could we implant those memories back in?
p274
aVCould we store these organs?
p275
aVWould each organ have to be developed for an individual human being
p276
aVand put back?
p277
aVAnd perhaps most puzzlingly,
p278
aVcould your medicine be an environment?
p279
aVCould you patent an environment?
p280
aVYou know, in every culture,
p281
aVshamans have been using environments as medicines.
p282
aVCould we imagine that for our future?
p283
aVI've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models.
p284
aVSo let me end with some thoughts about model building.
p285
aVThat's what we do as scientists.
p286
aVYou know, when an architect builds a model,
p287
aVhe or she is trying to show you a world in miniature.
p288
aVBut when a scientist is building a model,
p289
aVhe or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor.
p290
aVHe or she is trying to create a new way of seeing.
p291
aVThe former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, antibiotics created such a perceptual shift
p294
aVin our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored, distorted,
p295
aVvery successfully, the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years.
p296
aVBut we need new models to think about medicine in the future.
p297
aVThat's what's at stake.
p298
aa(lp299
VYou know, there's a popular trope out there
p300
aVthat the reason we haven't had the transformative impact
p301
aVon the treatment of illness
p302
aVis because we don't have powerful-enough drugs,
p303
aVand that's partly true.
p304
aVBut perhaps the real reason is
p305
aVthat we don't have powerful-enough ways of thinking about medicines.
p306
aVIt's certainly true that
p307
aVit would be lovely to have new medicines.
p308
aVBut perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's:
p309
aVmechanisms, models, metaphors.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Applause)
p314
aa(lp315
VChris Anderson: I really like this metaphor.
p316
aVHow does it link in?
p317
aVThere's a lot of talk in technologyland
p318
aVabout the personalization of medicine,
p319
aVthat we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future
p320
aVwill be for you specifically, your genome, your current context.
p321
aVDoes that apply to this model you've got here?
p322
aa(lp323
VSiddhartha Mukherjee: It's a very interesting question.
p324
aVWe've thought about personalization of medicine
p325
aVvery much in terms of genomics.
p326
aVThat's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor,
p327
aVagain, to use that same word, in medicine today,
p328
aVthat we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine.
p329
aVBut of course the genome is just the bottom
p330
aVof a long chain of being, as it were.
p331
aVThat chain of being, really the first organized unit of that, is the cell.
p332
aVSo, if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way,
p333
aVwe have to think of personalizing cellular therapies,
p334
aVand then personalizing organ or organismal therapies,
p335
aVand ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment.
p336
aVSo I think at every stage, you know \u2014
p337
aVthere's that metaphor, there's turtles all the way.
p338
aVWell, in this, there's personalization all the way.
p339
aa(lp340
VCA: So when you say medicine could be a cell
p341
aVand not a pill,
p342
aVyou're talking about potentially your own cells.
p343
aa(lp344
VSM: Absolutely. CA: So converted to stem cells,
p345
aVperhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something, and prepared.
p346
aa(lp347
VSM: And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing.
p348
aVThis is what's happening, and in fact, we're slowly moving,
p349
aVnot away from genomics, but incorporating genomics
p350
aVinto what we call multi-order, semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,
p351
aVlike cells, like organs, like environments.
p352
aa(lp353
