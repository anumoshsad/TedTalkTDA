VThe old story about climate protection is that it's costly,
p4
aVor it would have been done already.
p5
aVSo government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.
p6
aVThe new story about climate protection
p7
aVis that it's not costly, but profitable.
p8
aVThis was a simple sign error,
p9
aVbecause it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,
p10
aVas is well known to companies that do it all the time \u2014
p11
aVfor example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.
p12
aVMany other firms \u2014 IBM \u2014 are reducing their energy intensity
p13
aVroutinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants,
p14
aVand they get their money back in two or three years.
p15
aVThat's called a profit.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it,
p18
aVit would be expensive, or we would have done it already,
p19
aVbecause markets are essentially perfect.
p20
aVIf, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation,
p21
aVand nobody could make any money.
p22
aVBut the new story about oil
p23
aVis the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil \u2014
p24
aVnot just incrementally, but completely \u2014
p25
aVquite the contrary. The United States, for example,
p26
aVcan completely eliminate its use of oil
p27
aVand rejuvenate the economy at the same time,
p28
aVled by business for profit,
p29
aVbecause it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil
p30
aVthan to keep on buying it.
p31
aVThis process will also be catalyzed by the military
p32
aVfor its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict,
p33
aVparticularly over oil.
p34
aa(lp35
VThis thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame"
p36
aVthat four colleagues and I wrote
p37
aVand have posted for free at Oilendgame.com \u2014
p38
aVabout 170,000 downloads so far.
p39
aVAnd it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon \u2014
p40
aVit's independent, it's peer-reviewed
p41
aVand all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal.
p42
aVNow, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.
p43
aVAround 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.
p44
aVAnd whale oil lit practically every building.
p45
aVBut in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859,
p46
aVat least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared,
p47
aVthanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal,
p48
aVto which the whalers had not been paying attention.
p49
aVSo, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers
p50
aVbefore they ran out of whales.
p51
aVThe remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators
p52
aVand profit-maximizing capitalists.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd it's funny \u2014 it feels a bit like this now for oil.
p57
aVWe've been spending the last few decades
p58
aVaccumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies
p59
aVfor saving and substituting for oil,
p60
aVand no one had bothered to add them up before.
p61
aVSo when we did, we found some very surprising things.
p62
aVNow, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.
p63
aVBoth national competitiveness and national security are at risk.
p64
aVOn the competitiveness front,
p65
aVwe all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.
p66
aVAnd serious competition from Europe, from Korea,
p67
aVand next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.
p68
aVHow long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new
p69
aVwally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?
p70
aVMaybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.
p71
aVChina has an energy policy
p72
aVbased on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.
p73
aVThey're not going to export your uncle's Buick.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd after that comes India.
p76
aVThe point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.
p77
aVThe question is, who will make them?
p78
aVWill we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil,
p79
aVor will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?
p80
aVThat seems to make more sense.
p81
aVThe more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil,
p82
aVthe more we face a very obvious array of problems.
p83
aVOur analysis assumes that they all cost nothing,
p84
aVbut nothing is not the right number.
p85
aVIt could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.
p86
aVAnd one of the worst of these
p87
aVis what it does to our standing in the world
p88
aVif other countries think that everything we do is about oil,
p89
aVif we have to treat countries that have oil
p90
aVdifferently than countries that don't have oil.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd our military get quite unhappy
p93
aVwith having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan
p94
aVwhen what they actually signed up for
p95
aVwas to protect American citizens.
p96
aVThey don't like fighting over oil,
p97
aVthey don't like being in the sands
p98
aVand they don't like where the oil money goes
p99
aVand what sort of instability it creates.
p100
aVNow, in order to avoid these problems,
p101
aVwhatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.
p102
aVWe can save half the oil by using it more efficiently,
p103
aVat a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.
p104
aVAnd then we can replace the other half
p105
aVwith a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.
p106
aVAnd that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel.
p107
aVAnd compared with the official forecast,
p108
aVthat oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025,
p109
aVwhich is half of what we've been paying lately,
p110
aa(lp111
Vthat will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon.
p112
aVNow, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars:
p113
aVhalf of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries;
p114
aVhalf of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry.
p115
aVIn the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.
p116
aVAnd protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.
p117
aVAnd we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.
p118
aVSo that's a very handsome return.
p119
aVIt's financeable in the private capital market.
p120
aVBut if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned,
p121
aVto happen sooner and with higher confidence,
p122
aVthen \u2014 and also to expand choice and manage risk \u2014
p123
aVthen you might like some light-handed public policies
p124
aVthat support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.
p125
aVAnd these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.
p126
aVThey make a little net money for the treasury.
p127
aa(lp128
VThey have a broad trans-ideological appeal,
p129
aVand because we want them actually to happen,
p130
aVwe figured out ways to do them
p131
aVthat do not require much, if any, federal legislation,
p132
aVand can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.
p133
aVJust to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem,
p134
aVnamely, light vehicles,
p135
aVhere are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag,
p136
aVand all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive.
p137
aVYou can sort of have it all with these things.
p138
aVFor example, this Opel two-seater
p139
aVdoes 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.
p140
aVThis muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light
p141
aVthat does zero to 60 in well under four seconds,
p142
aVand still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM \u2014
p145
aV84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.
p146
aVWell, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles
p147
aVcosts about 57 cents per saved gallon.
p148
aVBut it's even a better deal for heavy trucks,
p149
aVwhere you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon,
p150
aVwith better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on,
p151
aVand taking out weight so you can put it into payload.
p152
aVSo you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.
p153
aVThen you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency
p154
aVwith some operational improvements,
p155
aVdouble the big haulers' margins.
p156
aVAnd we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn the airplane business, it's again a similar story
p159
aVwhere the first 20 percent fuel saving is free,
p160
aVas Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.
p161
aVBut then the next generation of planes saves about half.
p162
aVAgain, much cheaper than buying the fuel.
p163
aVAnd if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body,
p164
aVkind of a flying wing with internal engines,
p165
aVthen you get about a factor three efficiency improvement
p166
aVat comparable or lower cost.
p167
aVLet me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks,
p168
aVbecause we all know the most about those;
p169
aVprobably everybody here drives one.
p170
aVAnd yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan,
p171
aVof all the fuel energy you feed into the car,
p172
aVseven-eighths never gets to the wheels;
p173
aVit's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon,
p174
aVthe power train and accessories.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo then of the energy that does get to the wheels,
p177
aVonly an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road,
p178
aVor to heat the air the car pushes aside.
p179
aVAnd only this little bit, only six percent
p180
aVactually ends up accelerating the car
p181
aVand then heating the brakes when you stop.
p182
aVIn fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver,
p183
aVless than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.
p184
aVThis is not very gratifying
p185
aVafter more than a century of devoted engineering effort.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
V(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VMoreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.
p192
aVAnd it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels
p193
aVis going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy
p194
aVgetting that energy to the wheels.
p195
aVSo there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.
p196
aVAnd the reason this has not been very seriously examined before
p197
aVis there was a common assumption in the industry that \u2014
p198
aVwell, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car,
p199
aVand it would cost a lot more to make,
p200
aVbecause the only way we know how to make cars much lighter
p201
aVwas to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.
p202
aVBut these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials.
p203
aa(lp204
VFor example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites
p205
aVin sporting goods.
p206
aVAnd it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety.
p207
aVHere's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.
p208
aVThe Golf was totaled.
p209
aVThe McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.
p210
aVThey'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.
p211
aVBut if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour,
p212
aVthe entire crash energy would be absorbed
p213
aVby a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones,
p214
aVweighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.
p215
aVBecause these materials could actually absorb
p216
aVsix to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel,
p217
aVand do so a lot more smoothly.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.
p220
aVWe could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.
p221
aVWhereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.
p222
aVAnd when you make them light in the right way,
p223
aVthat can be simpler and cheaper to make.
p224
aVYou can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.
p225
aVI showed here two years ago
p226
aVa little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised,
p227
aVquintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle \u2014
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aV\u2014 and this is a complete virtual design
p230
aVthat is production-costed manufacturable.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd the process needed to make it
p233
aVis actually coming toward the market quite nicely.
p234
aVWe figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer
p235
aVfor this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material,
p236
aVand then ways to thermoform it,
p237
aVbecause it's a combination of carbon and nylon,
p238
aVinto whatever complex shapes you want,
p239
aVlike the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.
p240
aVAnd the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.
p241
aVBecause the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.
p242
aVEach one is formed by one fairly cheap die set,
p243
aVinstead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.
p244
aVEach of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist.
p245
aVThey snap together like a kid's toy.
p246
aVSo you got rid of the body shop.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.
p249
aVThose are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.
p250
aVSo you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity
p251
aVthan the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.
p252
aVThe plant also gets smaller.
p253
aVNow, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil,
p254
aVincluding buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on,
p255
aVyou find that of the 28 million barrels a day
p256
aVthe government says we will need in 2025,
p257
aVwell, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then,
p258
aVwith another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over,
p259
aVat an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel,
p260
aVinstead of 26 for buying the oil.
p261
aVAnd then another six can be made robustly, competitively,
p262
aVfrom cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel,
p263
aVwithout interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.
p264
aa(lp265
VThere is a huge amount of gas to be saved,
p266
aVabout half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.
p267
aVAnd here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.
p268
aVSo much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast
p269
aVfrom areas already approved,
p270
aVyou have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that,
p271
aVbecause there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.
p272
aVWe could, of course, buy more efficiency.
p273
aVMaybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.
p274
aVOr wait to capture the second half of it.
p275
aVOr we could, of course, just get this little bit
p276
aVby continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil,
p277
aVor the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
p278
aVBut they'll sell it to Japan and China instead,
p279
aVbecause we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.
p280
aa(lp281
VOr we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance,
p282
aVor if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient,
p283
aVwe'd get rid of the domestic oil too.
p284
aVAnd that doesn't even count, for example,
p285
aVthat available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively
p286
aVmake enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.
p287
aVSo we have lots of options.
p288
aVAnd the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible.
p289
aVNow, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence,
p290
aVthere is a few ways government could help.
p291
aVFor example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebate
p292
aVin any size class of vehicle you want,
p293
aVcan increase the price of inefficient vehicles
p294
aVand correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles.
p295
aVYou're not paid to change size class.
p296
aVYou are paid to pick efficiency within a size class,
p297
aVin a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings
p298
aVrather than just the first two or three.
p299
aa(lp300
VThis expands choice rapidly in the market,
p301
aVand actually makes more money for automakers as well.
p302
aVI'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country
p303
aVby making it very cheaply possible for low-income families
p304
aVto get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars
p305
aVthat they could otherwise never get.
p306
aVAnd for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker,
p307
aVpreferably the dirtiest ones.
p308
aVThis creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit
p309
aVfrom customers they weren't going to get otherwise,
p310
aVbecause they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.
p311
aVAnd Detroit will make money on every unit.
p312
aVIt turns out that if, say, African-American and white households
p313
aVhad the same car ownership,
p314
aVit would cut employment disparity about in half
p315
aVby providing better access to job opportunities.
p316
aVSo this is a huge social win, too.
p317
aa(lp318
VGovernments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year.
p319
aVThere are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power
p320
aVto bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.
p321
aVAnd we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot
p322
aVthat's worth stretching further for.
p323
aVFor example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker
p324
aVto sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.
p325
aVThen the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes
p326
aVthey desperately need to cut their fuel bills,
p327
aVbut if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that,
p328
aVthere are ways to finance it.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes,
p331
aVso that if they were otherwise to come back in the air,
p332
aVthey would waste more oil,
p333
aVand block the uptake of efficient, new planes.
p334
aVThose part inefficient planes
p335
aVare worth more to society dead than alive.
p336
aVWe ought to take them out back and shoot them,
p337
aVand put bounty hunters after them.
p338
aVThen there's an important military role.
p339
aVThat in creating the move to high-volume,
p340
aVlow-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials,
p341
aVor for that matter, ultra-light steels
p342
aVthat are a good backup technology,
p343
aVthe military can do the trick it did
p344
aVin turning DARPAnet into the Internet.
p345
aVJust turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.
p346
aa(lp347
VThe same for GPS.
p348
aVThe same for the modern semi-conductor industry.
p349
aVThat is, military science and technology that they need
p350
aVcan create the advanced materials-industrial cluster
p351
aVthat transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil,
p352
aVwhich would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil
p353
aVand advancing national and global security.
p354
aVThen we need to retool the car industry and do retraining,
p355
aVand shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains
p356
aVto shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates,
p357
aVand get out of our own way in other ways.
p358
aVAnd make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.
p359
aa(lp360
VBut here's how the whole thing fits together.
p361
aVInstead of official forecasts of oil use
p362
aVand oil imports going forever up,
p363
aVthey can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency,
p364
aVdown steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks,
p365
aVall implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention.
p366
aVAnd if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there,
p367
aVwe are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.
p370
aVIn this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention,
p371
aVthe economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent,
p372
aVoil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.
p373
aVThey would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.
p374
aVWell, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods.
p375
aa(lp376
VWe could rerun that play a lot better now.
p377
aVAnd yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.
p378
aVOurs is on the demand side.
p379
aVWe are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter)
p380
aVWe can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VWhatever your reason for wanting to do this,
p385
aVwhether you're concerned about national security or price volatility \u2014
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aV\u2014 or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids,
p388
aVit seems to me that this is an oil endgame
p389
aVthat we should all be playing to win.
