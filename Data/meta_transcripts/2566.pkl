VIn July of 1911,
p4
aVa 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp
p5
aVwith his team.
p6
aVAfter climbing a steep hill
p7
aVand wiping the sweat from his brow,
p8
aVhe described what he saw beneath him.
p9
aVHe saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage
p10
aVthis incredible interlocking maze of structures
p11
aVbuilt of granite,
p12
aVbeautifully put together.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat's amazing about this project
p15
aVis that it was the first funded by National Geographic,
p16
aVand it graced the front cover of its magazine in 1912.
p17
aVThis professor used state-of-the-art photography equipment
p18
aVto record the site,
p19
aVforever changing the face of exploration.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe site was Machu Picchu,
p22
aVdiscovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.
p23
aVWhen he saw the site, he asked,
p24
aV"This is an impossible dream.
p25
aVWhat could it be?"
p26
aa(lp27
VSo today,
p28
aV100 years later,
p29
aVI invite you all on an incredible journey with me,
p30
aVa 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Cheers)
p33
aa(lp34
VWe will do nothing less than use state-of-the-art technology
p35
aVto map an entire country.
p36
aVThis is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,
p37
aVbut we are expanding it to the world,
p38
aVmaking archaeological exploration more open, inclusive,
p39
aVand at a scale simply not previously possible.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is why I am so excited
p42
aVto share with you all today
p43
aVthat we will begin the 2016 TED Prize platform
p44
aVin Latin America,
p45
aVmore specifically Peru.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VThank you.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe will be taking Hiram Bingham's impossible dream
p52
aVand turning it into an amazing future
p53
aVthat we can all share in together.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.
p56
aVIt has absolutely stunning jewelry,
p57
aVlike what you can see here.
p58
aVIt has amazing Moche pottery of human figures.
p59
aVIt has the Nazca Lines
p60
aVand amazing textiles.
p61
aVSo as part of the TED Prize platform,
p62
aVwe are going to partnering with some incredible organizations,
p63
aVfirst of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider
p64
aVof high-resolution commercial satellite imagery.
p65
aVThey're going to be helping us build out
p66
aVthis amazing crowdsourcing platform they have.
p67
aVMaybe some of you used it
p68
aVwith the MH370 crash and search for the airplane.
p69
aVOf course, they'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery.
p70
aVNational Geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration.
p71
aVAs well, they'll be providing us with rich content for the platform,
p72
aVincluding some of the archival imagery like you saw at the beginning of this talk
p73
aVand some of their documentary footage.
p74
aVWe've already begun to build and plan the platform,
p75
aVand I'm just so excited.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo here's the cool part.
p78
aVMy team, headed up by Chase Childs,
p79
aVis already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery.
p80
aVOf course, what you can see here is 0.3-meter data.
p81
aVThis is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru.
p82
aVIt dates to 850 AD.
p83
aVIt's a really amazing city, but let's zoom in.
p84
aVThis is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see.
p85
aVYou can see individual structures, individual buildings.
p86
aVAnd we've already begun to find previously unknown sites.
p87
aVWhat we can say already is that as part of the platform,
p88
aVyou will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites,
p89
aVlike this one here,
p90
aVand this potentially large one here.
p91
aVUnfortunately, we've also begun to uncover large-scale looting at sites,
p92
aVlike what you see here.
p93
aVSo many sites in Peru are threatened,
p94
aVbut the great part is that all of this data
p95
aVis going to be shared with archaeologists on the front lines
p96
aVof protecting these sites.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo I was just in Peru, meeting with their Minister of Culture
p99
aVas well as UNESCO.
p100
aVWe'll be collaborating closely with them.
p101
aVJust so you all know,
p102
aVthe site is going to be in both English and Spanish,
p103
aVwhich is absolutely essential to make sure
p104
aVthat people in Peru and across Latin America can participate.
p105
aVOur main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here,
p106
aVDr. Luis Jaime Castillo,
p107
aVprofessor at Catholic University.
p108
aVAs a respected Peruvian archaeologist and former vice-minister,
p109
aVDr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists
p110
aVso they can explore these sites on the ground.
p111
aVHe also runs this amazing drone mapping program,
p112
aVsome of the images of which you can see behind me here and here.
p113
aVAnd this data will be incorporated into the platform,
p114
aVand also he'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find.
p115
aa(lp116
VOur on-the-ground partner
p117
aVwho will be helping us with education, outreach,
p118
aVas well as site preservation components,
p119
aVis the Sustainable Preservation Initiative,
p120
aVled by Dr. Larry Coben.
p121
aVSome of you may not be aware
p122
aVthat some of the world's poorest communities
p123
aVcoexist with some of the world's most well-known archaeological sites.
p124
aVWhat SPI does
p125
aVis it helps to empower these communities,
p126
aVin particular women,
p127
aVwith new economic approaches and business training.
p128
aVSo it helps to teach them to create beautiful handicrafts
p129
aVwhich are then sold on to tourists.
p130
aVThis empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage
p131
aVand take ownership of it.
p132
aVI had the opportunity to spend some time with 24 of these women
p133
aVat a well-known archaeological site called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.
p134
aVThese women were unbelievably inspiring,
p135
aVand what's great is that SPI will help us transform communities
p136
aVnear some of the sites that you help to discover.
p137
aa(lp138
VPeru is just the beginning.
p139
aVWe're going to be expanding this platform to the world,
p140
aVbut already I've gotten thousands of emails
p141
aVfrom people all across the world \u2014 professors, educators, students,
p142
aVand other archaeologists \u2014 who are so excited to help participate.
p143
aVIn fact, they're already suggesting amazing places for us to help discover,
p144
aVincluding Atlantis.
p145
aVI don't know if we're going to be looking for Atlantis,
p146
aVbut you never know.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo I'm just so excited to launch this platform.
p149
aVIt's going to be launched formally by the end of the year.
p150
aVAnd I have to say,
p151
aVif what my team has already discovered in the past few weeks are any indication,
p152
aVwhat the world discovers is just going to be beyond imagination.
p153
aVMake sure to hold on to your alpacas.
p154
aa(lp155
VThank you very much.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VThank you.
