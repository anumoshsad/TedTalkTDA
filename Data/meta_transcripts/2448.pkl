VSo a few years ago,
p4
aVI did something really brave,
p5
aVor some would say really stupid.
p6
aVI ran for Congress.
p7
aa(lp8
VFor years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics
p9
aVas a fundraiser, as an organizer,
p10
aVbut in my heart, I always wanted to run.
p11
aVThe sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.
p12
aVShe had never lost a race,
p13
aVand no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.
p14
aVBut in my mind, this was my way
p15
aVto make a difference,
p16
aVto disrupt the status quo.
p17
aVThe polls, however, told a very different story.
p18
aVMy pollsters told me that I was crazy to run,
p19
aVthat there was no way that I could win.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I ran anyway,
p22
aVand in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.
p23
aVI swore I was going to win.
p24
aVI had the endorsement from the New York Daily News,
p25
aVthe Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day,
p26
aVand CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.
p27
aVI raised money from everyone I knew,
p28
aVincluding Indian aunties
p29
aVthat were just so happy an Indian girl was running.
p30
aVBut on election day, the polls were right,
p31
aVand I only got 19 percent of the vote,
p32
aVand the same papers that said I was a rising political star
p33
aVnow said I wasted 1.3 million dollars
p34
aVon 6,321 votes.
p35
aVDon't do the math.
p36
aVIt was humiliating.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, before you get the wrong idea,
p39
aVthis is not a talk about the importance of failure.
p40
aVNor is it about leaning in.
p41
aVI tell you the story of how I ran for Congress
p42
aVbecause I was 33 years old
p43
aVand it was the first time in my entire life
p44
aVthat I had done something that was truly brave,
p45
aVwhere I didn't worry about being perfect.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd I'm not alone:
p48
aVso many women I talk to tell me
p49
aVthat they gravitate towards careers and professions
p50
aVthat they know they're going to be great in,
p51
aVthat they know they're going to be perfect in,
p52
aVand it's no wonder why.
p53
aVMost girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.
p54
aVWe're taught to smile pretty,
p55
aVplay it safe, get all A's.
p56
aVBoys, on the other hand,
p57
aVare taught to play rough, swing high,
p58
aVcrawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.
p59
aVAnd by the time they're adults,
p60
aVwhether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date,
p61
aVthey're habituated to take risk after risk.
p62
aVThey're rewarded for it.
p63
aVIt's often said in Silicon Valley,
p64
aVno one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.
p65
aVIn other words,
p66
aVwe're raising our girls to be perfect,
p67
aVand we're raising our boys to be brave.
p68
aa(lp69
VSome people worry about our federal deficit,
p70
aVbut I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
p71
aVOur economy, our society, we're just losing out
p72
aVbecause we're not raising our girls to be brave.
p73
aVThe bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM,
p74
aVin C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,
p75
aVand pretty much everywhere you look.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck
p78
aVlooked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment
p79
aVthat was too difficult for them.
p80
aVShe found that bright girls were quick to give up.
p81
aVThe higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.
p82
aVBright boys, on the other hand,
p83
aVfound the difficult material to be a challenge.
p84
aVThey found it energizing.
p85
aVThey were more likely to redouble their efforts.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat's going on?
p88
aVWell, at the fifth grade level,
p89
aVgirls routinely outperform boys in every subject,
p90
aVincluding math and science,
p91
aVso it's not a question of ability.
p92
aVThe difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge.
p93
aVAnd it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
p94
aVAn HP report found that men will apply for a job
p95
aVif they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications,
p96
aVbut women, women will apply
p97
aVonly if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications.
p98
aV100 percent.
p99
aVThis study is usually invoked as evidence that, well,
p100
aVwomen need a little more confidence.
p101
aVBut I think it's evidence
p102
aVthat women have been socialized to aspire to perfection,
p103
aVand they're overly cautious.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd even when we're ambitious,
p108
aVeven when we're leaning in,
p109
aVthat socialization of perfection
p110
aVhas caused us to take less risks in our careers.
p111
aVAnd so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now
p112
aVin computing and tech,
p113
aVwomen are being left behind,
p114
aVand it means our economy is being left behind
p115
aVon all the innovation and problems women would solve
p116
aVif they were socialized to be brave
p117
aVinstead of socialized to be perfect.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VSo in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code,
p122
aVand what I found is that by teaching them to code
p123
aVI had socialized them to be brave.
p124
aVCoding, it's an endless process of trial and error,
p125
aVof trying to get the right command in the right place,
p126
aVwith sometimes just a semicolon
p127
aVmaking the difference between success and failure.
p128
aVCode breaks and then it falls apart,
p129
aVand it often takes many, many tries
p130
aVuntil that magical moment
p131
aVwhen what you're trying to build comes to life.
p132
aVIt requires perseverance.
p133
aVIt requires imperfection.
p134
aa(lp135
VWe immediately see in our program
p136
aVour girls' fear of not getting it right,
p137
aVof not being perfect.
p138
aVEvery Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story.
p139
aVDuring the first week, when the girls are learning how to code,
p140
aVa student will call her over and she'll say,
p141
aV"I don't know what code to write."
p142
aVThe teacher will look at her screen,
p143
aVand she'll see a blank text editor.
p144
aVIf she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student
p145
aVspent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen.
p146
aVBut if she presses undo a few times,
p147
aVshe'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.
p148
aVShe tried, she came close,
p149
aVbut she didn't get it exactly right.
p150
aVInstead of showing the progress that she made,
p151
aVshe'd rather show nothing at all.
p152
aVPerfection or bust.
p153
aa(lp154
VIt turns out that our girls are really good at coding,
p155
aVbut it's not enough just to teach them to code.
p156
aa(lp157
VMy friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia
p158
aVand teaches intro to Java
p159
aVtells me about his office hours with computer science students.
p160
aVWhen the guys are struggling with an assignment,
p161
aVthey'll come in and they'll say,
p162
aV"Professor, there's something wrong with my code."
p163
aVThe girls will come in and say,
p164
aV"Professor, there's something wrong with me."
p165
aa(lp166
VWe have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection,
p167
aVbut we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood
p168
aVthat lets girls know that they are not alone.
p169
aVBecause trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.
p170
aVI can't tell you how many women tell me,
p171
aa(lp172
V"I'm afraid to raise my hand,
p173
aVI'm afraid to ask a question,
p174
aVbecause I don't want to be the only one
p175
aVwho doesn't understand,
p176
aVthe only one who is struggling.
p177
aVWhen we teach girls to be brave
p178
aVand we have a supportive network cheering them on,
p179
aVthey will build incredible things,
p180
aVand I see this every day.
p181
aVTake, for instance, two of our high school students
p182
aVwho built a game called Tampon Run \u2014
p183
aVyes, Tampon Run \u2014
p184
aVto fight against the menstruation taboo
p185
aVand sexism in gaming.
p186
aVOr the Syrian refugee
p187
aVwho dared show her love for her new country
p188
aVby building an app to help Americans get to the polls.
p189
aVOr a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm
p190
aVto help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant
p191
aVin the off chance that she can save her daddy's life
p192
aVbecause he has cancer.
p193
aVThese are just three examples of thousands,
p194
aVthousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect,
p195
aVwho have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance.
p196
aVAnd whether they become coders
p197
aVor the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,
p198
aVthey will not defer their dreams.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd those dreams have never been more important for our country.
p201
aVFor the American economy, for any economy to grow,
p202
aVto truly innovate,
p203
aVwe cannot leave behind half our population.
p204
aVWe have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection,
p205
aVand we've got to do it now.
p206
aVWe cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did
p207
aVwhen I was 33 years old.
p208
aVWe have to teach them to be brave in schools
p209
aVand early in their careers,
p210
aVwhen it has the most potential to impact their lives
p211
aVand the lives of others,
p212
aVand we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted
p213
aVnot for being perfect
p214
aVbut for being courageous.
p215
aVAnd so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know \u2014
p216
aVyour sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague \u2014
p217
aVto be comfortable with imperfection,
p218
aVbecause when we teach girls to be imperfect,
p219
aVand we help them leverage it,
p220
aVwe will build a movement of young women who are brave
p221
aVand who will build a better world for themselves
p222
aVand for each and every one of us.
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aVThank you.
p228
aa(lp229
VChris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
p230
aVIt's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision.
p231
aVTell me how it's going.
p232
aVHow many girls are involved now in your program?
p233
aa(lp234
VReshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
p235
aVThis year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd that number is really powerful,
p240
aVbecause last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science.
p241
aVLike, the problem is so bad
p242
aVthat we can make that type of change quickly.
p243
aa(lp244
VCA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even,
p245
aVwho are welcoming graduates from your program?
p246
aa(lp247
VRS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,
p248
aVfrom Twitter to Facebook
p249
aVto Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney,
p250
aVI mean, every single company out there.
p251
aVAnd if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you,
p252
aVbecause we need every single tech company
p253
aVto embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.
p254
aa(lp255
VCA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies
p256
aVthat when you mix in more gender balance
p257
aVin the engineering teams, good things happen.
p258
aa(lp259
VRS: Great things happen.
p260
aVI mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact
p261
aVthat right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.
p262
aVWomen use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men.
p263
aVWe own the Internet,
p264
aVand we should be building the companies of tomorrow.
p265
aVAnd I think when companies have diverse teams,
p266
aVand they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams,
p267
aVthey build awesome things, and we see it every day.
p268
aa(lp269
VCA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work.
p270
aVThis whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you.
p271
aa(lp272
VRS: Thank you.
