VMy name is Joshua Walters.
p4
aVI'm a performer.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Beatboxing)

aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
V(Applause)
p11
aa(lp12
VBut as far as being a performer,
p13
aVI'm also diagnosed
p14
aVbipolar.
p15
aVI reframe that as a positive
p16
aVbecause the crazier I get onstage,
p17
aVthe more entertaining I become.
p18
aVWhen I was 16 in San Francisco,
p19
aVI had my breakthrough manic episode
p20
aVin which I thought I was Jesus Christ.
p21
aVMaybe you thought that was scary,
p22
aVbut actually there's no amount of drugs you can take
p23
aVthat can get you as high
p24
aVas if you think you're Jesus Christ.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VI was sent to a place,
p29
aVa psych ward,
p30
aVand in the psych ward,
p31
aVeveryone is doing their own one-man show.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVThere's no audience like this
p34
aVto justify their rehearsal time.
p35
aVThey're just practicing.
p36
aVOne day they'll get here.
p37
aVNow when I got out,
p38
aVI was diagnosed
p39
aVand I was given medications
p40
aVby a psychiatrist.
p41
aV"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some \u2014
p42
aVwhy don't we give you some Zyprexa.
p43
aVOkay? Mmhmm?
p44
aVAt least that's what it says on my pen."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVSome of you are in the field, I can see.
p47
aVI can feel your noise.
p48
aVThe first half of high school
p49
aVwas the struggle of the manic episode,
p50
aVand the second half
p51
aVwas the overmedications of these drugs,
p52
aVwhere I was sleeping through high school.
p53
aVThe second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.
p54
aVWhen I got out
p55
aVI had a choice.
p56
aVI could either deny
p57
aVmy mental illness
p58
aVor embrace
p59
aVmy mental skillness.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Bugle sound)
p62
aa(lp63
VThere's a movement going on right now
p64
aVto reframe mental illness as a positive \u2014
p65
aVat least the hypomanic edge part of it.
p66
aVNow if you don't know what hypomania is,
p67
aVit's like an engine that's out of control,
p68
aVmaybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.
p69
aVMany of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,
p70
aVhave that creative edge,
p71
aVif you know what I'm talking about.
p72
aVYou're driven to do something
p73
aVthat everyone has told you is impossible.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd there's a book \u2014 John Gartner.
p76
aVJohn Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"
p77
aVin which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs
p78
aVand all these business minds
p79
aVhave this edge to compete.
p80
aVA different book was written not too long ago
p81
aVin the mid-90s
p82
aVcalled "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison
p83
aVin which it was looked at in a creative sense
p84
aVin which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh
p85
aVall have this manic depression that they were suffering with.
p86
aVSome of them committed suicide.
p87
aVSo it wasn't all
p88
aVthe good side of the illness.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow recently,
p91
aVthere's been development in this field.
p92
aVAnd there was an article written in the New York Times,
p93
aVSeptember 2010,
p94
aVthat stated:
p95
aV"Just Manic Enough."
p96
aVJust be manic enough
p97
aVin which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs
p98
aVthat have this kind of spectrum \u2014
p99
aVyou know what I'm talking about \u2014
p100
aVnot maybe full bipolar,
p101
aVbut they're in the bipolar spectrum \u2014
p102
aVwhere on one side,
p103
aVmaybe you think you're Jesus,
p104
aVand on the other side
p105
aVmaybe they just make you a lot of money.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVYour call. Your call.
p108
aVAnd everyone's somewhere in the middle.
p109
aVEveryone's somewhere in the middle.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo maybe, you know,
p112
aVthere's no such thing
p113
aVas crazy,
p114
aVand being diagnosed with a mental illness
p115
aVdoesn't mean you're crazy.
p116
aVBut maybe it just means
p117
aVyou're more sensitive
p118
aVto what most people can't see
p119
aVor feel.
p120
aVMaybe no one's really crazy.
p121
aVEveryone is just a little bit mad.
p122
aVHow much
p123
aVdepends on where you fall in the spectrum.
p124
aVHow much
p125
aVdepends on how lucky you are.
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.
