VTyler Dewar: The way I feel right now
p4
aVis that all of the other speakers
p5
aVhave said exactly what I wanted to say.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVAnd it seems that the only thing left for me to say
p8
aVis to thank you all for your kindness.
p9
aa(lp10
VTD: But maybe in the spirit
p11
aVof appreciating the kindness of you all,
p12
aVI could share with you
p13
aVa little story about myself.
p14
aa(lp15
VTD: From the time I was very young, onward,
p16
aVI was given
p17
aVa lot of different responsibilities,
p18
aVand it always seemed to me, when I was young,
p19
aVthat everything was laid out before me.
p20
aVAll of the plans for me were already made.
p21
aVI was given the clothes that I needed to wear
p22
aVand told where I needed to be,
p23
aVgiven these very precious
p24
aVand holy looking robes to wear,
p25
aVwith the understanding
p26
aVthat it was something sacred or important.
p27
aa(lp28
VTD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,
p29
aVI was living in eastern Tibet with my family.
p30
aVAnd when I was seven years old,
p31
aVall of a sudden,
p32
aVa search party arrived at my home.
p33
aVThey were looking the next Karmapa,
p34
aVand I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,
p35
aVand the news came to me that they were telling me
p36
aVthat I was the Karmapa.
p37
aVAnd these days, people ask me a lot,
p38
aVhow did that feel.
p39
aVHow did that feel when they came and whisked you away,
p40
aVand your lifestyle completely changed?
p41
aVAnd what I mostly say is that,
p42
aVat that time,
p43
aVit was a pretty interesting idea to me.
p44
aVI thought that things would be pretty fun
p45
aVand there would be more things to play with.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VTD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,
p50
aVas I thought it would have been.
p51
aVI was placed
p52
aVin a pretty strictly controlled environment.
p53
aVAnd immediately,
p54
aVa lot of different responsibilities,
p55
aVin terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.
p56
aVI was separated, largely, from my family,
p57
aVincluding my mother and father.
p58
aVI didn't have have many personal friends
p59
aVto spend time with,
p60
aVbut I was expected to perform
p61
aVthese prescribed duties.
p62
aVSo it turned out that my fantasy
p63
aVabout an entertaining life of being the Karmapa
p64
aVwasn't going to come true.
p65
aVIt more felt to be the case to me
p66
aVthat I was being treated like a statue,
p67
aVand I was to sit in one place
p68
aVlike a statue would.
p69
aa(lp70
VTD: Nevertheless, I felt that,
p71
aVeven though I've been separated from my loved ones \u2014
p72
aVand, of course, now I'm even further away.
p73
aVWhen I was 14, I escaped from Tibet
p74
aVand became even further removed
p75
aVfrom my mother and father,
p76
aVmy relatives, my friends
p77
aVand my homeland.
p78
aVBut nevertheless,
p79
aVthere's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,
p80
aVin terms of the love that I feel
p81
aVfor these people.
p82
aVI feel, still, a very strong connection of love
p83
aVfor all of these people
p84
aVand for the land.
p85
aa(lp86
VTD: And I still do
p87
aVget to keep in touch with my mother and father,
p88
aValbeit infrequently.
p89
aVI talk to my mother
p90
aVonce in a blue moon on the telephone.
p91
aVAnd my experience is that,
p92
aVwhen I'm talking to her,
p93
aVwith every second that passes
p94
aVduring our conversation,
p95
aVthe feeling of love that binds us
p96
aVis bringing us closer and closer together.
p97
aa(lp98
VTD: So those were just a few remarks
p99
aVabout my personal background.
p100
aVAnd in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,
p101
aVin terms of ideas,
p102
aVI think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,
p103
aVwhere so many people from different backgrounds and places
p104
aVcan come together,
p105
aVexchange their ideas
p106
aVand form relationships of friendship with each other.
p107
aVAnd I think that's symbolic
p108
aVof what we're seeing in the world in general,
p109
aVthat the world is becoming smaller and smaller,
p110
aVand that all of the peoples in the world
p111
aVare enjoying more opportunities for connection.
p112
aVThat's wonderful,
p113
aVbut we should also remember
p114
aVthat we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
p115
aVAlong with outward development
p116
aVand increase of opportunity,
p117
aVthere should be inward development
p118
aVand deepening of our heart connections
p119
aVas well as our outward connections.
p120
aVSo we spoke and we heard some
p121
aVabout design this week.
p122
aVI think that it's important for us to remember
p123
aVthat we need
p124
aVto keep pushing forward
p125
aVon the endeavor
p126
aVof the design of the heart.
p127
aVWe heard a lot about technology this week,
p128
aVand it's important for us to remember
p129
aVto invest a lot of our energy
p130
aVin improving the technology of the heart.
p131
aa(lp132
VTD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy
p133
aVabout the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,
p134
aVstill, I feel a sense of impediment,
p135
aVwhen it comes
p136
aVto the ability that we have
p137
aVto connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.
p138
aVI feel that there are some things
p139
aVthat are getting in the way.
p140
aa(lp141
VTC: My relationship
p142
aVto this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,
p143
aVis an interesting one,
p144
aVbecause, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting
p145
aVto open my heart to others
p146
aVand offer myself up
p147
aVfor heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections
p148
aVin a genuine way with other people,
p149
aVbut at the same time,
p150
aVI've always been advised
p151
aVthat I need to emphasize intelligence
p152
aVover the heart-to-heart connections,
p153
aVbecause, being someone in a position like mine,
p154
aVif I don't rely primarily on intelligence,
p155
aVthen something dangerous may happen to me.
p156
aVSo it's an interesting paradox at play there.
p157
aVBut I had a really striking experience once,
p158
aVwhen a group from Afghanistan
p159
aVcame to visit me,
p160
aVand we had a really interesting conversation.
p161
aa(lp162
VTD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,
p163
aVwhich, as you know,
p164
aVwere destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
p165
aVBut the basis of our conversation
p166
aVwas the different approach to spirituality
p167
aVon the part of the Muslim
p168
aVand Buddhist traditions.
p169
aVOf course, in Muslim,
p170
aVbecause of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,
p171
aVyou don't find as many
p172
aVphysical representations of divinity
p173
aVor of spiritual liberation
p174
aVas you do in the Buddhist tradition,
p175
aVwhere, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha
p176
aVthat are highly revered.
p177
aVSo, we were talking about the differences
p178
aVbetween the traditions
p179
aVand what many people perceived
p180
aVas the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,
p181
aVbut I offered the suggestion
p182
aVthat perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.
p183
aVWhat we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas
p184
aVwas the depletion of matter,
p185
aVsome solid substance
p186
aVfalling down and disintegrating.
p187
aVMaybe we could look at that to be more similar
p188
aVto the falling of the Berlin Wall,
p189
aVwhere a divide
p190
aVthat had kept two types of people apart
p191
aVhad collapsed and opened up a door
p192
aVfor further communication.
p193
aVSo I think that, in this way,
p194
aVit's always possible for us
p195
aVto derive something positive
p196
aVthat can help us understand one another better.
p197
aa(lp198
VTD: So, with regard to the development
p199
aVthat we've been talking about
p200
aVhere at this conference,
p201
aVI really feel
p202
aVthat the development that we make
p203
aVshouldn't create a further burden
p204
aVfor us as human beings,
p205
aVbut should be used
p206
aVto improve
p207
aVour fundamental lifestyle
p208
aVof how we live in the world.
p209
aa(lp210
VTD: Of course, I rejoice
p211
aVin the development and the growth and the rise
p212
aVof the noble land of India, the great country of India,
p213
aVbut at the same time, I think,
p214
aVas some of us have acknowledged,
p215
aVwe need to be aware
p216
aVthat some aspects of this rise
p217
aVare coming at the cost
p218
aVof the very ground
p219
aVon which we stand.
p220
aVSo, as we are climbing the tree,
p221
aVsome of the things that we're doing
p222
aVin order to climb the tree
p223
aVare actually undermining
p224
aVthe tree's very root.
p225
aVAnd so,
p226
aVwhat I think it comes down to
p227
aVis a question of, not only having information of what's going on,
p228
aVbut paying attention to that
p229
aVand letting that shift our motivation
p230
aVto become more sincere
p231
aVand genuinely positive.
p232
aVWe have hear, this week,
p233
aVabout the horrible sufferings, for example,
p234
aVthat so many women of the world
p235
aVare enduring day-to-day.
p236
aVWe have that information,
p237
aVbut what often happens to us
p238
aVis that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.
p239
aVWe don't really choose to allow that
p240
aVto cause there to be a shift in our hearts.
p241
aVSo I think the way forward for the world \u2014
p242
aVone that will bring the path of outer development
p243
aVin harmony
p244
aVwith the real root of happiness \u2014
p245
aVis that we allow
p246
aVthe information that we have
p247
aVto really make a change in our heart.
p248
aa(lp249
VTD: So I think that sincere motivation
p250
aVis very important for our future well-being,
p251
aVor deep sense of well-being as humans,
p252
aVand I think that means sinking in
p253
aVto whatever it is you're doing now.
p254
aVWhatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,
p255
aVsink into that,
p256
aVget a full taste of that.
p257
aa(lp258
VTD: So, since we've been here this week,
p259
aVwe've taken millions of breaths, collectively,
p260
aVand perhaps we haven't witnessed
p261
aVany course changes
p262
aVhappening in our lives,
p263
aVbut we often miss the very subtle changes.
p264
aVAnd I think
p265
aVthat sometimes we develop
p266
aVgrand concepts
p267
aVof what happiness
p268
aVmight look like for us,
p269
aVbut that, if we pay attention,
p270
aVwe can see that there are little symbols of happiness
p271
aVin every breath that we take.
p272
aa(lp273
VTD: So, every one of you who has come here
p274
aVis so talented,
p275
aVand you have so much to offer to the world,
p276
aVI think it would be a good note to conclude on then
p277
aVto just take a moment
p278
aVto appreciate how fortunate we are
p279
aVto have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
p280
aVand really form a strong aspiration
p281
aVand energy within ourselves
p282
aVthat we will take the good
p283
aVthat has come from this conference,
p284
aVthe momentum, the positivity,
p285
aVand we will spread that and plant it
p286
aVin all of the corners of the world.
p287
aa(lp288
VHis Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.
p289
aa(lp290
VTD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,
p291
aVeven in inviting me,
p292
aVlet alone everything else that she has done
p293
aVto make this happen,
p294
aVand I was somewhat resistant at times,
p295
aVand I was also very nervous throughout this week.
p296
aVI was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,
p297
aVand people would ask me, why.
p298
aVI would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."
p299
aVAnd so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,
p300
aVbut I very much appreciate
p301
aVthe opportunity she's given me
p302
aVto be here.
p303
aVAnd to you, everyone, thank you very much.
