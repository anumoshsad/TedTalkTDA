VLast year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim
p4
aVwhich I did across the North Pole.
p5
aVAnd while that swim took place three years ago,
p6
aVI can remember it as if it was yesterday.
p7
aVI remember standing on the edge of the ice,
p8
aVabout to dive into the water,
p9
aVand thinking to myself, I have never ever
p10
aVseen any place on this earth
p11
aVwhich is just so frightening.
p12
aVThe water is completely black.
p13
aVThe water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,
p14
aVor 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
p15
aVIt's flipping freezing in that water.
p16
aVAnd then a thought came across my mind:
p17
aVif things go pear-shaped on this swim,
p18
aVhow long will it take for my frozen body
p19
aVto sink the four and a half kilometers
p20
aVto the bottom of the ocean?
p21
aVAnd then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought
p22
aVout of my mind as quickly as possible.
p23
aVAnd the only way I can dive
p24
aVinto that freezing cold water
p25
aVand swim a kilometer
p26
aVis by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,
p27
aVlistening to everything from beautiful opera
p28
aVall the way across to Puff Daddy,
p29
aVand then committing myself a hundred percent \u2014
p30
aVthere is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind \u2014
p31
aVand then walking up to the edge of the ice
p32
aVand just diving into the water.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd that swim took me
p35
aV18 minutes and 50 seconds,
p36
aVand it felt like 18 days.
p37
aVAnd I remember getting out of the water
p38
aVand my hands feeling so painful
p39
aVand looking down at my fingers,
p40
aVand my fingers were literally the size of sausages
p41
aVbecause \u2014 you know, we're made partially of water \u2014
p42
aVwhen water freezes it expands,
p43
aVand so the cells in my fingers
p44
aVhad frozen and expanded
p45
aVand burst.
p46
aVAnd the most immediate thought when I came out of that water
p47
aVwas the following:
p48
aVI'm never, ever
p49
aVgoing to do another cold water swim
p50
aVin my life again.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas
p53
aVand the melting of the \u2014 (Laughter)
p54
aVand the melting of the glaciers
p55
aVbecause of climate change.
p56
aVI heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
p57
aVThis lake has been formed in the last couple of years
p58
aVbecause of the melting of the glacier.
p59
aVThe glacier's gone all the way up the mountain
p60
aVand left in its place this big lake.
p61
aVAnd I firmly believe
p62
aVthat what we're seeing in the Himalayas
p63
aVis the next great, big battleground
p64
aVon this earth.
p65
aVNearly two billion people \u2014
p66
aVso one in three people on this earth \u2014
p67
aVrely on the water from the Himalayas.
p68
aVAnd with a population increasing as quickly as it is,
p69
aVand with the water supply from these glaciers \u2014
p70
aVbecause of climate change \u2014
p71
aVdecreasing so much,
p72
aVI think we have a real risk of instability.
p73
aVNorth, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
p74
aVall these countries.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd so I decided
p77
aVto walk up to Mt. Everest,
p78
aVthe highest mountain on this earth,
p79
aVand go and do a symbolic swim
p80
aVunderneath the summit
p81
aVof Mt. Everest.
p82
aVNow, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,
p83
aVbut it's quite an ordeal getting up there.
p84
aV28 great, big, powerful yaks
p85
aVcarrying all the equipment up onto this mountain \u2014
p86
aVI don't just have my Speedo,
p87
aVbut there's a big film crew who then
p88
aVsend all the images around the world.
p89
aVThe other thing which was so challenging about this swim
p90
aVis not just the altitude.
p91
aVI wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
p92
aVSo it's right up in the heavens.
p93
aVIt's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
p94
aVI feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer
p95
aVjust hitting your head all the time.
p96
aa(lp97
VThat's not the worst part of it.
p98
aVThe worst part was this year was the year where they decided
p99
aVto do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
p100
aVMany, many people have died on Mt. Everest,
p101
aVand this was the year they decided to go
p102
aVand recover all the bodies of the mountaineers
p103
aVand then bring them down the mountain.
p104
aVAnd when you're walking up the mountain
p105
aVto attempt to do something
p106
aVwhich no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish \u2014
p107
aVthere are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters \u2014
p108
aVWhen you're trying to do that,
p109
aVand then the bodies are coming past you,
p110
aVit humbles you,
p111
aVand you also realize very, very clearly
p112
aVthat nature is so much more powerful
p113
aVthan we are.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd we walked up this pathway,
p116
aVall the way up.
p117
aVAnd to the right hand side of us
p118
aVwas this great Khumbu Glacier.
p119
aVAnd all the way along the glacier we saw
p120
aVthese big pools of melting ice.
p121
aVAnd then we got up to this small lake
p122
aVunderneath the summit of Mt. Everest,
p123
aVand I prepared myself
p124
aVthe same way as I've always prepared myself,
p125
aVfor this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
p126
aVI put on my iPod, I listened to some music,
p127
aVI got myself as aggressive as possible \u2014
p128
aVbut controlled aggression \u2014
p129
aVand then I hurled myself
p130
aVinto that water.
p131
aa(lp132
VI swam as quickly as I could
p133
aVfor the first hundred meters,
p134
aVand then I realized very, very quickly,
p135
aVI had a huge problem on my hands.
p136
aVI could barely breathe.
p137
aVI was gasping for air.
p138
aVI then began to choke,
p139
aVand then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
p140
aVAnd it all happened so quickly:
p141
aVI then \u2014 I don't know how it happened \u2014 but I went underwater.
p142
aVAnd luckily, the water was quite shallow,
p143
aVand I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake
p144
aVand get up and then take another gasp of air.
p145
aVAnd then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
p146
aVI carried on for another five or six strokes,
p147
aVand then I had nothing in my body,
p148
aVand I went down to the bottom of the lake.
p149
aVAnd I don't where I got it from,
p150
aVbut I was able to somehow
p151
aVpull myself up and as quickly as possible
p152
aVget to the side of the lake.
p153
aVI've heard it said that drowning
p154
aVis the most peaceful death that you can have.
p155
aVI have never, ever heard
p156
aVsuch utter bollocks.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVIt is the most frightening and panicky feeling
p159
aVthat you can have.
p160
aa(lp161
VI got myself to the side of the lake.
p162
aVMy crew grabbed me,
p163
aVand then we walked as quickly as we could
p164
aVdown \u2014 over the rubble \u2014
p165
aVdown to our camp.
p166
aVAnd there, we sat down,
p167
aVand we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
p168
aVthere on Mt. Everest.
p169
aVAnd my team just gave it to me straight.
p170
aVThey said, Lewis, you need to have
p171
aVa radical tactical shift
p172
aVif you want to do this swim.
p173
aVEvery single thing which you have learned
p174
aVin the past 23 years of swimming,
p175
aVyou must forget.
p176
aVEvery single thing which you learned
p177
aVwhen you were serving in the British army,
p178
aVabout speed and aggression,
p179
aVyou put that to one side.
p180
aVWe want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
p181
aVTake some time to rest and think about things.
p182
aVWe want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,
p183
aVand instead of swimming fast,
p184
aVswim as slowly as possible.
p185
aVInstead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
p186
aVAnd remember, never ever swim with aggression.
p187
aVThis is the time to swim
p188
aVwith real humility.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd so we walked back up
p191
aVto the mountain two days later.
p192
aVAnd I stood there
p193
aVon the edge of the lake,
p194
aVand I looked up at Mt. Everest \u2014
p195
aVand she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth \u2014
p196
aVand I said to myself, just do this slowly.
p197
aVAnd I swam across the lake.
p198
aVAnd I can't begin to tell you
p199
aVhow good I felt
p200
aVwhen I came to the other side.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut I learned two very, very
p203
aVimportant lessons there on Mt. Everest,
p204
aVand I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
p205
aVThe first one is
p206
aVthat just because something has worked in the past so well,
p207
aVdoesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
p208
aVAnd similarly,
p209
aVnow, before I do anything,
p210
aVI ask myself what type of mindset
p211
aVdo I require
p212
aVto successfully complete a task.
p213
aVAnd taking that into the world of climate change \u2014
p214
aVwhich is, frankly,
p215
aVthe Mt. Everest of all problems \u2014
p216
aVjust because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,
p217
aVjust because we have consumed the way we have for so long
p218
aVand populated the earth the way we have for so long,
p219
aVdoesn't mean that we can carry on
p220
aVthe way we are carrying on.
p221
aVThe warning signs are all there.
p222
aVWhen I was born, the world's population
p223
aVwas 3.5 billion people.
p224
aVWe're now 6.8 billion people,
p225
aVand we're expected to be 9 billion people
p226
aVby 2050.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then the second lesson,
p229
aVthe radical, tactical shift.
p230
aVAnd I've come here to ask you today:
p231
aVwhat radical tactical shift
p232
aVcan you take in your relationship to the environment,
p233
aVwhich will ensure
p234
aVthat our children and our grandchildren
p235
aVlive in a safe world
p236
aVand a secure world,
p237
aVand most importantly, in a sustainable world?
p238
aVAnd I ask you, please, to go away from here
p239
aVand think about that one
p240
aVradical tactical shift
p241
aVwhich you could make,
p242
aVwhich will make that big difference,
p243
aVand then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
p244
aVBlog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,
p245
aVand commit a hundred percent,
p246
aVbecause very, very few things
p247
aVare impossible to achieve
p248
aVif we really put our whole minds to it.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo thank you very, very much.
