VWhen you're a child,
p4
aVanything and everything is possible.
p5
aVThe challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up.
p6
aVAnd as a four-year-old,
p7
aVI had the opportunity to sail for the first time.
p8
aa(lp9
VI will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast.
p10
aVI will never forget
p11
aVthe feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat
p12
aVand stared into her tiny cabin for the first time.
p13
aVBut the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom,
p14
aVthe feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails.
p15
aVAs a four-year-old child,
p16
aVit was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine.
p17
aVI made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow,
p18
aVI was going to sail around the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream.
p21
aVAge 10, it was saving my school dinner money change.
p22
aVEvery single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans,
p23
aVwhich cost 4p each, and gravy was free.
p24
aVEvery day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box,
p25
aVand when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in
p26
aVand cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper.
p27
aVFinally, I bought a tiny dinghy.
p28
aVI spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal.
p29
aVI read every book I could on sailing,
p30
aVand then eventually, having been told by my school
p31
aVI wasn't clever enough to be a vet,
p32
aVleft school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo imagine how it felt just four years later
p35
aVto be sitting in a boardroom
p36
aVin front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true.
p37
aVI felt like my life depended on that moment,
p38
aVand incredibly, he said yes.
p39
aVAnd I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting
p40
aVdesigning a boat on which I was going to sail
p41
aVsolo nonstop around the world.
p42
aVFrom that first meeting to the finish line of the race,
p43
aVit was everything I'd ever imagined.
p44
aVJust like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts.
p45
aVWe missed an iceberg by 20 feet.
p46
aVNine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast.
p47
aVWe were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean.
p48
aVBut the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness
p49
aVwere absolutely breathtaking.
p50
aVAfter three months at sea, age just 24,
p51
aVI finished in second position.
p52
aVI'd loved it, so much so that within six months
p53
aVI decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race:
p54
aVto try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world.
p55
aVNow for this, I needed a different craft:
p56
aVbigger, wider, faster, more powerful.
p57
aVJust to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast
p58
aVall the way to the top.
p59
aVSeventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.
p60
aVI affectionately called her Moby.
p61
aVShe was a multihull.
p62
aVWhen we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop
p63
aVaround the world in one, though many had tried,
p64
aVbut whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her
p65
aVand not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days
p66
aVright down to 72.
p67
aVThe bar was now much, much higher.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd these boats were exciting to sail.
p70
aVThis was a training sail off the French coast.
p71
aVThis I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board.
p72
aVFive seconds is all it took from everything being fine
p73
aVto our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater,
p74
aVand that five seconds goes quickly.
p75
aVJust see how far below those guys the sea is.
p76
aVImagine that alone in the Southern Ocean
p77
aVplunged into icy water, thousands of miles away from land.
p78
aa(lp79
VIt was Christmas Day.
p80
aVI was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia.
p81
aVThe conditions were horrendous.
p82
aVI was approaching a part in the ocean
p83
aVwhich was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town.
p84
aVThe nearest land was Antarctica, and the nearest people
p85
aVwould be those manning the European Space Station above me.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVYou really are in the middle of nowhere.
p88
aVIf you need help,
p89
aVand you're still alive,
p90
aVit takes four days for a ship to get to you
p91
aVand then four days for that ship to get you back to port.
p92
aVNo helicopter can reach you out there,
p93
aVand no plane can land.
p94
aVWe are forging ahead of a huge storm.
p95
aVWithin it, there was 80 knots of wind,
p96
aVwhich was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with.
p97
aVThe waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,
p98
aVand the spray from the breaking crests
p99
aVwas blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard.
p100
aVIf we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm,
p101
aVand either capsized or smashed to pieces.
p102
aVWe were quite literally hanging on for our lives
p103
aVand doing so on a knife edge.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger.
p106
aVWe all know what it's like driving a car 20 miles an hour, 30, 40.
p107
aVIt's not too stressful. We can concentrate.
p108
aVWe can turn on the radio.
p109
aVTake that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.
p110
aVNow you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel.
p111
aVNow take that car off road at night
p112
aVand remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen,
p113
aVthe headlights and the brakes.
p114
aVThat's what it's like in the Southern Ocean.
p115
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p116
aVYou could imagine
p117
aVit would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation,
p118
aVeven as a passenger.
p119
aVBut you're not a passenger.
p120
aVYou're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in,
p121
aVand you have to make every single decision on board.
p122
aVI was absolutely exhausted, physically and mentally.
p123
aVEight sail changes in 12 hours.
p124
aVThe mainsail weighed three times my body weight,
p125
aVand after each change,
p126
aVI would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat
p127
aVwith this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut out there, those lowest of the lows
p130
aVare so often contrasted with the highest of the highs.
p131
aVA few days later, we came out of the back of the low.
p132
aVAgainst all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record
p133
aVwithin that depression.
p134
aVThe sky cleared, the rain stopped,
p135
aVand our heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed
p136
aVinto the most beautiful moonlit mountains.
p137
aa(lp138
VIt's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there.
p139
aVYour boat is your entire world,
p140
aVand what you take with you when you leave is all you have.
p141
aVIf I said to you all now, "Go off into Vancouver
p142
aVand find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months,"
p143
aVthat's quite a task.
p144
aVThat's food, fuel, clothes,
p145
aVeven toilet roll and toothpaste.
p146
aVThat's what we do,
p147
aVand when we leave we manage it
p148
aVdown to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food.
p149
aVNo experience in my life
p150
aVcould have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word "finite."
p151
aVWhat we have out there is all we have.
p152
aVThere is no more.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite
p155
aVthat I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing
p156
aVuntil I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VSuddenly I connected the dots.
p161
aVOur global economy is no different.
p162
aVIt's entirely dependent on finite materials
p163
aVwe only have once in the history of humanity.
p164
aVAnd it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone
p165
aVand having two choices:
p166
aVI either put that stone to one side
p167
aVand learn more about it, or I put that stone back
p168
aVand I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world.
p169
aa(lp170
VI chose the first.
p171
aVI put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning,
p172
aVspeaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists
p173
aVto try to understand just how our global economy works.
p174
aVAnd my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places.
p175
aa(lp176
VThis photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station.
p177
aVI was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs,
p178
aVbut also very close to my family.
p179
aVMy great-grandfather was a coal miner,
p180
aVand he spent 50 years of his life underground.
p181
aVThis is a photo of him, and when you see that photo,
p182
aVyou see someone from another era.
p183
aVNo one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high
p184
aVin this day and age. (Laughter)
p185
aVBut yet, that's me with my great-grandfather,
p186
aVand by the way, they are not his real ears. (Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VWe were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories.
p189
aVHe talked of the camaraderie underground,
p190
aVand the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches
p191
aVto give to the ponies they worked with underground.
p192
aVIt was like it was yesterday.
p193
aVAnd on my journey of learning,
p194
aVI went to the World Coal Association website,
p195
aVand there in the middle of the homepage, it said,
p196
aV"We have about 118 years of coal left."
p197
aVAnd I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime,
p198
aVand a much greater figure than the predictions for oil.
p199
aVBut I did the math, and I realized that my great-grandfather
p200
aVhad been born exactly 118 years before that year,
p201
aVand I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old,
p202
aVand I realized it's nothing
p203
aVin time, nor in history.
p204
aVAnd it made me make a decision I never thought I would make:
p205
aVto leave the sport of solo sailing behind me
p206
aVand focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across:
p207
aVthe future of our global economy.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy.
p210
aVIt was also materials.
p211
aVIn 2008, I picked up a scientific study
p212
aVlooking at how many years we have
p213
aVof valuable materials to extract from the ground:
p214
aVcopper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.
p215
aVThese figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite.
p216
aVWe only have them once.
p217
aVAnd yet, our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly,
p218
aVexponentially.
p219
aVWith more people in the world with more stuff,
p220
aVwe've effectively seen 100 years of price declines
p221
aVin those basic commodities erased in just 10 years.
p222
aVAnd this affects all of us.
p223
aVIt's brought huge volatility in prices,
p224
aVso much so that in 2011,
p225
aVyour average European car manufacturer
p226
aVsaw a raw material price increase
p227
aVof 500 million Euros,
p228
aVwiping away half their operating profits
p229
aVthrough something they have absolutely no control over.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life.
p232
aVI started traveling less, doing less, using less.
p233
aVIt felt like actually doing less was what we had to do.
p234
aVBut it sat uneasy with me.
p235
aVIt didn't feel right.
p236
aVIt felt like we were buying ourselves time.
p237
aVWe were eking things out a bit longer.
p238
aVEven if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem.
p239
aVIt wouldn't fix the system.
p240
aVIt was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was,
p241
aVin the transition to what? What could actually work?
p242
aa(lp243
VIt struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live,
p244
aVis fundamentally flawed,
p245
aVand I realized ultimately
p246
aVthat our operating system, the way our economy functions,
p247
aVthe way our economy's been built, is a system in itself.
p248
aVAt sea, I had to understand complex systems.
p249
aVI had to take multiple inputs,
p250
aVI had to process them,
p251
aVand I had to understand the system to win.
p252
aVI had to make sense of it.
p253
aVAnd as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system,
p254
aVbut it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy
p257
aVfor 150 years,
p258
aVwhere we take a material out of the ground,
p259
aVwe make something out of it, and then ultimately
p260
aVthat product gets thrown away, and yes, we do recycle some of it,
p261
aVbut more an attempt to get out what we can at the end,
p262
aVnot by design.
p263
aVIt's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term,
p264
aVand if we know that we have finite materials,
p265
aVwhy would we build an economy that would effectively use things up,
p266
aVthat would create waste?
p267
aVLife itself has existed for billions of years
p268
aVand has continually adapted to use materials effectively.
p269
aVIt's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste.
p270
aVEverything is metabolized.
p271
aVIt's not a linear economy at all, but circular.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd I felt like the child in the garden.
p274
aVFor the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed.
p275
aVIf we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up,
p276
aVwe could build a future that really could work in the long term.
p277
aVI was excited.
p278
aVThis was something to work towards.
p279
aVWe knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there,
p280
aVand it was exactly with this in mind
p281
aVthat we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010.
p282
aa(lp283
VMany schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model:
p284
aVindustrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, biomimicry,
p285
aVand of course, cradle-to-cradle design.
p286
aVMaterials would be defined as either technical or biological,
p287
aVwaste would be designed out entirely,
p288
aVand we would have a system that could function
p289
aVabsolutely in the long term.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo what could this economy look like?
p292
aVMaybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light,
p293
aVand the manufacturers would recover the materials
p294
aVand change the light fittings when we had more efficient products.
p295
aVWhat if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water
p296
aVand we could ultimately drink it? It would never become waste.
p297
aVWhat if engines were re-manufacturable,
p298
aVand we could recover the component materials
p299
aVand significantly reduce energy demand.
p300
aVWhat if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them,
p301
aVand then fundamentally recover the materials within them
p302
aVthrough a second stage?
p303
aVWhat if we could collect food waste, human waste?
p304
aVWhat if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy,
p305
aVultimately reconnecting nutrients systems
p306
aVand rebuilding natural capital?
p307
aVAnd cars \u2014 what we want is to move around.
p308
aVWe don't need to own the materials within them.
p309
aVCould cars become a service
p310
aVand provide us with mobility in the future?
p311
aVAll of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today,
p312
aVand these lie at the forefront of the circular economy.
p313
aVWhat lies before us is to expand them and scale them up.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo how would you shift from linear to circular?
p316
aVWell, the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work
p317
aVwith the top universities in the world,
p318
aVwith leading businesses within the world,
p319
aVwith the biggest convening platforms in the world,
p320
aVand with governments.
p321
aVWe thought you might want to work with the best analysts
p322
aVand ask them the question,
p323
aV"Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints?
p324
aVIs the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital?
p325
aVCould the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use?"
p326
aVYes was the answer to the decoupling,
p327
aVbut also yes, we could replace current fertilizer use
p328
aVby a staggering 2.7 times.
p329
aVBut what inspired me most about the circular economy
p330
aVwas its ability to inspire young people.
p331
aVWhen young people see the economy through a circular lens,
p332
aVthey see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon.
p333
aVThey can use their creativity and knowledge
p334
aVto rebuild the entire system,
p335
aVand it's there for the taking right now,
p336
aVand the faster we do this, the better.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo could we achieve this in their lifetimes?
p339
aVIs it actually possible?
p340
aVI believe yes.
p341
aVWhen you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather, anything's possible.
p342
aVWhen he was born, there were only 25 cars in the world;
p343
aVthey had only just been invented.
p344
aVWhen he was 14, we flew for the first time in history.
p345
aVNow there are 100,000 charter flights
p346
aVevery single day.
p347
aVWhen he was 45, we built the first computer.
p348
aVMany said it wouldn't catch on, but it did, and just 20 years later
p349
aVwe turned it into a microchip
p350
aVof which there will be thousands in this room here today.
p351
aVTen years before he died, we built the first mobile phone.
p352
aVIt wasn't that mobile, to be fair,
p353
aVbut now it really is,
p354
aVand as my great-grandfather left this Earth, the Internet arrived.
p355
aVNow we can do anything,
p356
aVbut more importantly,
p357
aVnow we have a plan.
p358
