VGood morning everybody.
p4
aa(lp5
VI work with really amazing,
p6
aVlittle, itty-bitty creatures called cells.
p7
aVAnd let me tell you what it's like
p8
aVto grow these cells in the lab.
p9
aVI work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.
p10
aVWe plate them into dishes
p11
aVthat we sometimes call petri dishes.
p12
aVAnd we feed them \u2014 sterilely of course \u2014
p13
aVwith what we call cell culture media \u2014 which is like their food \u2014
p14
aVand we grow them in incubators.
p15
aa(lp16
VWhy do I do this?
p17
aVWe observe the cells in a plate,
p18
aVand they're just on the surface.
p19
aVBut what we're really trying to do in my lab
p20
aVis to engineer tissues out of them.
p21
aVWhat does that even mean?
p22
aVWell it means growing an actual heart,
p23
aVlet's say,
p24
aVor grow a piece of bone
p25
aVthat can be put into the body.
p26
aVNot only that, but they can also be used for disease models.
p27
aVAnd for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques
p28
aVjust really aren't enough.
p29
aVThe cells are kind of homesick;
p30
aVthe dish doesn't feel like their home.
p31
aVAnd so we need to do better at copying their natural environment
p32
aVto get them to thrive.
p33
aVWe call this the biomimetic paradigm \u2014
p34
aVcopying nature in the lab.
p35
aa(lp36
VLet's take the example of the heart,
p37
aVthe topic of a lot of my research.
p38
aVWhat makes the heart unique?
p39
aVWell, the heart beats,
p40
aVrhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.
p41
aVWe copy this in the lab
p42
aVby outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.
p43
aVThese electrodes act like mini pacemakers
p44
aVto get the cells to contract in the lab.
p45
aVWhat else do we know about the heart?
p46
aVWell, heart cells are pretty greedy.
p47
aVNature feeds the heart cells in your body
p48
aVwith a very, very dense blood supply.
p49
aVIn the lab, we micro-pattern channels
p50
aVin the biomaterials
p51
aVon which we grow the cells,
p52
aVand this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,
p53
aVthrough the scaffolds where we're growing the cells \u2014
p54
aVa lot like what you might expect
p55
aVfrom a capillary bed in the heart.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo this brings me to lesson number one:
p58
aVlife can do a lot with very little.
p59
aVLet's take the example of electrical stimulation.
p60
aVLet's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.
p61
aVOn the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue
p62
aVthat I engineered from rat cells in the lab.
p63
aVIt's about the size of a mini marshmallow.
p64
aVAnd after one week, it's beating.
p65
aVYou can see it in the upper left-hand corner.
p66
aVBut don't worry if you can't see it so well.
p67
aVIt's amazing that these cells beat at all.
p68
aVBut what's really amazing
p69
aVis that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,
p70
aVlike with a pacemaker,
p71
aVthat they beat so much more.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut that brings me to lesson number two:
p74
aVcells do all the work.
p75
aVIn a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,
p76
aVbecause structural engineers
p77
aVbuild bridges and big things,
p78
aVcomputer engineers, computers,
p79
aVbut what we are doing
p80
aVis actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.
p81
aVWhat does this mean for us?
p82
aVLet's do something really simple.
p83
aVLet's remind ourselves
p84
aVthat cells are not an abstract concept.
p85
aVLet's remember that our cells sustain our lives
p86
aVin a very real way.
p87
aV"We are what we eat," could easily be described
p88
aVas, "We are what our cells eat."
p89
aVAnd in the case of the flora in our gut,
p90
aVthese cells may not even be human.
p91
aVBut it's also worth noting
p92
aVthat cells also mediate our experience of life.
p93
aVBehind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell
p94
aVis a corresponding set of cells
p95
aVthat receive this information
p96
aVand interpret it for us.
p97
aVIt begs the question:
p98
aVshall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship
p99
aVto include the ecosystem of our own bodies?
p100
aa(lp101
VI invite you to talk about this with me further,
p102
aVand in the meantime, I wish you luck.
p103
aVMay none of your non-cancer cells
p104
aVbecome endangered species.
p105
aa(lp106
VThank you.
