VAs a researcher, every once in a while
p4
aVyou encounter something
p5
aVa little disconcerting.
p6
aVAnd this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,
p7
aVand teaches you that you're very wrong
p8
aVabout something that you really believed firmly in.
p9
aVAnd these are unfortunate moments,
p10
aVbecause you go to sleep that night
p11
aVdumber than when you woke up.
p12
aVSo, that's really the goal of my talk,
p13
aVis to A, communicate that moment to you
p14
aVand B, have you leave this session
p15
aVa little dumber than when you entered.
p16
aVSo, I hope I can really accomplish that.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, this incident that I'm going to describe
p19
aVreally began with some diarrhea.
p20
aVNow, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.
p21
aVThat's why there's a glass of water up there.
p22
aVFor us, it's a problem, the people in this room.
p23
aVFor babies, it's deadly.
p24
aVThey lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.
p25
aVAnd so, as a result, there is a lot of death,
p26
aVa lot of death.
p27
aVIn India in 1960,
p28
aVthere was a 24 percent child mortality rate,
p29
aVlots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.
p30
aVOne of the big reasons this happened was
p31
aVbecause of diarrhea.
p32
aVNow, there was a big effort to solve this problem,
p33
aVand there was actually a big solution.
p34
aVThis solution has been called, by some,
p35
aV"potentially the most important medical
p36
aVadvance this century."
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, the solution turned out to be simple.
p39
aVAnd what it was was oral rehydration salts.
p40
aVMany of you have probably used this.
p41
aVIt's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium
p42
aVand glucose together so that when you add it to water
p43
aVthe child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.
p44
aVRemarkable impact on mortality.
p45
aVMassive solution to the problem.
p46
aVFlash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality
p47
aVhas dropped to 6.5 percent today.
p48
aa(lp49
VStill a big number, but a big drop.
p50
aVIt looks like the technological problem is solved.
p51
aVBut if you look, even today
p52
aVthere are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths
p53
aVin India alone.
p54
aVWhat's going on here?
p55
aVWell the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts
p56
aVto those people.
p57
aVThat's actually not true.
p58
aVIf you look in areas where these salts are completely available,
p59
aVthe price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.
p60
aVMaybe there's a biological answer.
p61
aVMaybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration
p62
aValone doesn't solve. That's not true either.
p63
aVMany of these deaths were completely preventable,
p64
aVand this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,
p65
aVwhat I want to call "the last mile" problem.
p66
aa(lp67
VSee, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains \u2014
p68
aVtechnological, scientific, hard work,
p69
aVcreativity, human ingenuity \u2014
p70
aVto crack important social problems with technology solutions.
p71
aVThat's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,
p72
aVthat's mankind moving forward.
p73
aVBut in this case we cracked it,
p74
aVbut a big part of the problem still remains.
p75
aVNine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,
p76
aVthe last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, that's for oral rehydration therapy.
p79
aVMaybe this is something unique about diarrhea.
p80
aVWell, it turns out \u2014 and this is where things get really disconcerting \u2014
p81
aVit's not unique to diarrhea.
p82
aVIt's not even unique to poor people in India.
p83
aVHere's an example from a variety of contexts.
p84
aVI've put a bunch of examples up here.
p85
aa(lp86
VI'll start with insulin, diabetes
p87
aVmedication in the U.S.
p88
aVOK, the American population.
p89
aVOn Medicaid \u2014 if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,
p90
aVor if you have health insurance \u2014 insulin is pretty straightforward.
p91
aVYou get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;
p92
aVyou have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.
p93
aVMassive technological advance:
p94
aVtook an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.
p95
aVAdherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?
p96
aVAbout on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.
p97
aVAs a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,
p98
aVhundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,
p99
aVfor something that's solvable.
p100
aa(lp101
VHere I have a bunch of other examples,
p102
aVall suffer from the last mile problem.
p103
aVIt's not just medicine.
p104
aVHere's another example from technology:
p105
aVagriculture. We think
p106
aVthere's a food problem, so we create new seeds.
p107
aVWe think there's an income problem, so we create
p108
aVnew ways of farming that increase income.
p109
aVWell, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.
p110
aVIntercropping. Intercropping really increases income.
p111
aVSometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield
p112
aVwhen you mix different varieties of rice side by side.
p113
aVSome people are doing that,
p114
aVmany are not. What's going on?
p115
aVThis is the last mile.
p116
aVThe last mile is, everywhere, problematic.
p117
aa(lp118
VAlright, what's the problem?
p119
aVThe problem is this little three-pound machine
p120
aVthat's behind your eyes and between your ears.
p121
aVThis machine is really strange,
p122
aVand one of the consequences is that people are weird.
p123
aVThey do lots of inconsistent things.
p124
aV(Applause)
p125
aVThey do lots of inconsistent things.
p126
aVAnd the inconsistencies
p127
aVcreate, fundamentally, this last mile problem.
p128
aVSee, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,
p129
aVthe genes, the things inside here, the blood?
p130
aVThat's complex, but it's manageable.
p131
aVWhen we're dealing with people like this?
p132
aVThe mind is more complex.
p133
aVThat's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.
p134
aa(lp135
VLet me go back to diarrhea for a second.
p136
aVHere's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,
p137
aVwhich is a survey asked of many Indian women:
p138
aV"Your child has diarrhea.
p139
aVShould you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?"
p140
aVJust so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:
p141
aVIt's increase.
p142
aVNow, diarrhea's interesting
p143
aVbecause it's been around for thousands of years,
p144
aVever since humankind really
p145
aVlived side by side enough to have really polluted water.
p146
aVOne Roman strategy that was very interesting
p147
aVwas that \u2014 and it really gave them a comparative advantage \u2014
p148
aVthey made sure their soldiers didn't drink
p149
aVeven remotely muddied waters.
p150
aVBecause if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective
p151
aVon the battlefield.
p152
aVSo, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,
p153
aVthe breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, here are these women. They've seen their parents
p156
aVhave struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,
p157
aVthey've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?
p158
aVIn India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."
p159
aVThink about what that means for a second.
p160
aVThirty-five to 50 percent of women
p161
aVforget oral rehydration therapy,
p162
aVthey are increasing \u2014
p163
aVthey are actually making their child
p164
aVmore likely to die through their actions.
p165
aVHow is that possible?
p166
aVWell, one possibility \u2014 I think that's how most people respond to this \u2014
p167
aVis to say, "That's just stupid."
p168
aVI don't think that's stupid.
p169
aVI think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.
p170
aVAnd that is, you don't put water
p171
aVinto a leaky bucket.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.
p174
aVJust doesn't make sense.
p175
aVNow, the model is intuitively right.
p176
aVIt just doesn't happen to be right about the world.
p177
aVBut it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.
p178
aVAnd that, to me, is the fundamental challenge
p179
aVof the last mile.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.
p182
aVConvincing people to do something \u2014
p183
aVtake oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be \u2014
p184
aVis not an act of information:
p185
aV"Let's give them the data,
p186
aVand when they have data they'll do the right thing."
p187
aVIt's more complex than that.
p188
aVAnd if you want to understand how it's more complex
p189
aVlet me start with something kind of interesting.
p190
aa(lp191
VI'm going to give you a little math problem,
p192
aVand I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.
p193
aVA bat and a ball together cost $1.10.
p194
aVThe bat costs a dollar more than the ball.
p195
aVHow much does the ball cost? Quick.
p196
aVSo, somebody out there says, "Five."
p197
aVA lot of you said, "Ten."
p198
aVLet's think about 10 for a second.
p199
aVIf the ball costs 10, the bat costs...
p200
aVthis is easy, $1.10.
p201
aVYeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.
p202
aVSo, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.
p203
aVMost of you look smart.
p204
aVThe combination of that produces
p205
aVsomething that is actually, you got this thing wrong.
p206
aa(lp207
VHow is that possible? Let's go to something else.
p208
aVI know algebra can be complicated.
p209
aVSo, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?
p210
aVLet's go back to kindergarten. OK?
p211
aVThere's a great show on American television that you have to watch.
p212
aVIt's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"
p213
aVI think we've learned the answer to that here.
p214
aVLet's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.
p215
aVHere's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.
p216
aVI just want you to name the color of the object.
p217
aVThat's all it is. OK?
p218
aa(lp219
VI want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,
p220
aVand do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.
p221
aVReady? Black.
p222
aVNow the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.
p223
aVReady? Go.
p224
aa(lp225
VAudience: Red. Green.
p226
aVYellow. Blue. Red.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VSendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.
p230
aVAlmost out of kindergarten.
p231
aVWhat is all this telling us?
p232
aVYou see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem
p233
aVis that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,
p234
aVsome models that you use to understand the world.
p235
aVThese models, like the leaky bucket,
p236
aVwork well in most situations.
p237
aVI suspect most of you \u2014
p238
aVI hope that's true for the rest of you \u2014
p239
aVactually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.
p240
aa(lp241
VI found a problem, a specific problem
p242
aVthat actually found an error with that.
p243
aVDiarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.
p244
aVThey are situations where the mental model
p245
aVdoesn't match the reality.
p246
aVSame thing here:
p247
aVYou had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.
p248
aVYou read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, I do this stuff because it's fun.
p251
aVBut it's more profound than fun.
p252
aVI'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.
p253
aVBMW is a pretty safe car.
p254
aVAnd they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.
p255
aVI want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"
p256
aV"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."
p257
aVBut the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,
p258
aVit doesn't look like a Volvo,
p259
aVand it doesn't look like a Hummer.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo, what I want you to think about for a few minutes
p262
aVis: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?
p263
aVSo now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.
p264
aVThe second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?
p265
aa(lp266
VHere's another puzzle for all of you.
p267
aVOne person walks into a car lot,
p268
aVand they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.
p269
aVThey are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do
p270
aVthe environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,
p271
aV50 miles per gallon."
p272
aVAnother person walks into the lot,
p273
aVand they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,
p274
aVfully loaded, luxury.
p275
aVAnd they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"
p276
aVI'm going to do something good for the environment.
p277
aVI'm going to take off some of that weight,
p278
aVand I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon."
p279
aa(lp280
VWhich one of these people has done more for the environment?
p281
aVSee, you have a mental model.
p282
aVFifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.
p283
aVTurns out, go home and do the math,
p284
aVthe nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.
p285
aVWhy? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about
p286
aVgallons per mile.
p287
aVThink about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.
p288
aVMiles per gallon is the way we present things.
p289
aa(lp290
VIf we want to encourage change of behavior,
p291
aVgallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.
p292
aVResearchers have found these type of anomalies.
p293
aVOkay, back to BMW. What should they do?
p294
aVThe problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.
p295
aVThis car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.
p296
aVHere was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.
p297
aVThey showed a BMW driving down the street.
p298
aVThere's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.
p299
aVThe car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.
p300
aa(lp301
VBWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.
p302
aVYou can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,
p303
aVor you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
p304
aVRemarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.
p305
aVIt harnesses something you already believe.
p306
aVNow, even if I persuaded you to do something,
p307
aVit's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.
p308
aVYou all probably intended to wake up,
p309
aVI don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.
p310
aVThis is a battle we all fight every day,
p311
aValong with trying to get to the gym.
p312
aVNow, this is an example of that battle,
p313
aVand makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,
p314
aVand so one of the fundamental challenges
p315
aVis how we would actually do that. OK?
p316
aa(lp317
VSo, let me now talk about the last mile problem.
p318
aVSo far, I've been pretty negative.
p319
aVI've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.
p320
aVAnd I think maybe I'm being too negative.
p321
aVMaybe it's the diarrhea.
p322
aVMaybe the last mile problem really should be thought of
p323
aVas the last mile opportunity.
p324
aa(lp325
VLet's go back to diabetes.
p326
aVThis is a typical insulin injection.
p327
aVNow, carrying this thing around is complicated.
p328
aVYou gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.
p329
aVIt's also painful.
p330
aVNow, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,
p331
aVyou know, I would obviously use it every day."
p332
aVBut the pain, the discomfort,
p333
aVyou know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse
p334
aVwhen you go on a long trip:
p335
aVThese are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.
p336
aVHere is an innovation, a design innovation.
p337
aVThis is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.
p338
aVThe needle is particularly sharp.
p339
aVYou just gotta carry this thing around.
p340
aVIt's much easier to use, much less painful.
p341
aVAnywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,
p342
aVjust as a result of this.
p343
aa(lp344
VThat's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.
p345
aVYou see, we tend to think the problem is solved
p346
aVwhen we solve the technology problem.
p347
aVBut the human innovation, the human problem
p348
aVstill remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.
p349
aVThis isn't about the biology of people;
p350
aVthis is now about the brains, the psychology of people,
p351
aVand innovation needs to continue all the way through
p352
aVthe last mile.
p353
aa(lp354
VHere's another example of this.
p355
aVThis is from a company called Positive Energy.
p356
aVThis is about energy efficiency.
p357
aVWe're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.
p358
aVWhat this company does is they send a letter
p359
aVto households that say, "Here's your energy use,
p360
aVhere's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.
p361
aV"You're doing worse." Frown.
p362
aVAnd what they find is just this letter, nothing else,
p363
aVhas a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd you want to think about the social value of that
p366
aVin terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,
p367
aV900 million dollars per year.
p368
aVWhy? Because for free,
p369
aVthis isn't a new technology, this is a letter \u2014
p370
aVwe're getting a Big Bang in behavior.
p371
aVSo, how do we tackle the last mile?
p372
aVI think this tells us there is an opportunity.
p373
aVAnd I think to tackle it, we need to combine
p374
aVpsychology,
p375
aVmarketing,
p376
aVart, we've seen that.
p377
aVBut you know what we need to combine it with?
p378
aVWe need to combine this with the scientific method.
p379
aa(lp380
VSee what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,
p381
aVis that the first 999 miles are all about science.
p382
aVNo one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."
p383
aVWe have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.
p384
aVBut you know what we do on the last mile?
p385
aV"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there."
p386
aVThe amount of resources we put in are disparate.
p387
aVWe put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.
p388
aVHow much are we putting into
p389
aVenergy behavior change
p390
aVin a credible, systematic, testing way?
p391
aa(lp392
VNow, I think that we're on the verge of something big.
p393
aVWe're on the verge of a whole new social science.
p394
aVIt's a social science that recognizes \u2014
p395
aVmuch like science recognizes the complexity of the body,
p396
aVbiology recognizes the complexity of the body \u2014 we'll recognize
p397
aVthe complexity of the human mind.
p398
aVThe careful testing, retesting, design,
p399
aVare going to open up vistas of understanding,
p400
aVcomplexities, difficult things.
p401
aVAnd those vistas will both create new science,
p402
aVand fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.
p403
aVAll right. Thank you very much.
p404
aV(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VChris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.
p407
aVSo, this whole area is so fascinating.
p408
aVI mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists
p409
aVthat they are kind of putting into place
p410
aVacademically, what great marketers
p411
aVhave sort of intuitively known for a long time.
p412
aVHow much is your field talking to great marketers
p413
aVabout their insights into human psychology?
p414
aVBecause they've seen it on the ground.
p415
aa(lp416
VSendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,
p417
aVand I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,
p418
aVthere are insights to be gleaned there.
p419
aVForty percent of it is about what marketing is.
p420
aVMarketing is selling an ad to a firm.
p421
aVSo, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about
p422
aVconvincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign."
p423
aVSo, there is a little bit of slippage there.
p424
aVThat's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.
p425
aVAnd one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually
p426
