V\u266b Slide into the shimmering surface \u266b
p10
aV\u266b between two worlds. \u266b
p11
aV\u266b Standing at the center of time \u266b
p12
aV\u266b as it uncurls. \u266b
p13
aV\u266b Cutting through the veil of illusion. \u266b
p14
aV\u266b Moving beyond past conclusions. \u266b
p15
aV\u266b Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. \u266b
p16
aV\u266b If I could be anywhere, \u266b
p17
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere, \u266b
p18
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere right now, \u266b
p19
aV\u266b I would want to be here. \u266b
p20
aV\u266b Searching for the future \u266b
p21
aV\u266b among the things we're throwing away. \u266b
p22
aV\u266b Trying to see the world \u266b
p23
aV\u266b through the junk we produce everyday. \u266b
p24
aV\u266b They say nothing lasts forever, \u266b
p25
aV\u266b but all the plastic ever made is still here. \u266b
p26
aV\u266b And no amount of closing our eyes \u266b
p27
aV\u266b will make it disappear. \u266b
p28
aV\u266b If I could be anywhere, \u266b
p29
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere, \u266b
p30
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere in history, \u266b
p31
aV\u266b I would want to be here. \u266b
p32
aV\u266b The Romans, the Spanish \u266b
p33
aV\u266b the British, the Dutch, \u266b
p34
aV\u266b American exceptionalism, so out of touch. \u266b
p35
aV\u266b The folly of empire repeating its course, \u266b
p36
aV\u266b imposing its will \u266b
p37
aV\u266b and ruling by force \u266b
p38
aV\u266b on and on through time. \u266b
p39
aV\u266b But the world can't take it very much longer. \u266b
p40
aV\u266b We're not going to make it \u266b
p41
aV\u266b unless we're smarter and stronger. \u266b
p42
aV\u266b The world is going to shake itself free of our greed \u266b
p43
aV\u266b somehow. \u266b
p44
aV\u266b If I could be anywhere, \u266b
p45
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere in time, \u266b
p46
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere and change things, \u266b
p47
aV\u266b it would have to be now. \u266b
p48
aV\u266b They say nothing last forever, \u266b
p49
aV\u266b but all the plastic ever made is still here. \u266b
p50
aV\u266b And no amount of closing our eyes \u266b
p51
aV\u266b will make it disappear. \u266b
p52
aV\u266b And the world can't take it \u266b
p53
aV\u266b very much longer. \u266b
p54
aV\u266b We're not going to make it \u266b
p55
aV\u266b unless we're smarter and stronger. \u266b
p56
aV\u266b The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed \u266b
p57
aV\u266b somehow. \u266b
p58
aV\u266b And the world can't take it, that you can see. \u266b
p59
aV\u266b If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. \u266b
p60
aV\u266b The world's gonna shake itself all the way free \u266b
p61
aV\u266b somehow. \u266b
p62
aV\u266b If I could be anywhere, \u266b
p63
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere in time, \u266b
p64
aV\u266b if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, \u266b
p65
aV\u266b it would have to be now. \u266b
