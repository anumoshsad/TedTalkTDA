VI want you to touch your face.
p4
aVGo on.
p5
aVWhat do you feel?
p6
aVSoft? Squishy?
p7
aVIt's you, right? You're feeling you?
p8
aVWell, it's not quite true.
p9
aVYou're actually feeling thousands of microscopic creatures
p10
aVthat live on our face and fingers.
p11
aVYou're feeling some of the fungi
p12
aVthat drifted down from the air ducts today.
p13
aVThey set off our allergies
p14
aVand smell of mildew.
p15
aVYou're feeling some of the 100 billion bacterial cells
p16
aVthat live on our skin.
p17
aVThey've been munching away at your skin oils and replicating,
p18
aVproducing the smells of body odor.
p19
aVYou're likely even touching the fecal bacteria
p20
aVthat sprayed onto you the last time you flushed a toilet,
p21
aVor those bacteria that live in our water pipes
p22
aVand sprayed onto you with your last shower.
p23
aVSorry.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VYou're probably even giving a microscopic high five
p28
aVto the two species of mites that live on our faces,
p29
aVon all of our faces.
p30
aVThey've spent the night squirming across your face
p31
aVand having sex on the bridge of your nose.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VMany of them are now leaking their gut contents onto your pores.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VNow look at your finger.
p40
aVHow's it feel? Gross?
p41
aVIn desperate need of soap or bleach?
p42
aVThat's how you feel now,
p43
aVbut it's not going to be how you feel in the future.
p44
aa(lp45
VFor the last 100 years,
p46
aVwe've had an adversarial relationship
p47
aVwith the microscopic life nearest us.
p48
aVIf I told you there was a bug in your house
p49
aVor bacteria in your sink,
p50
aVthere was a human-devised solution for that,
p51
aVa product to eradicate, exterminate,
p52
aVdisinfect.
p53
aVWe strive to remove most of the microscopic life in our world now.
p54
aVBut in doing so, we're ignoring the best source of new technology
p55
aVon this planet.
p56
aVThe last 100 years have featured human solutions to microbial problems,
p57
aVbut the next 100 years will feature microbial solutions to human problems.
p58
aa(lp59
VI'm a scientist, and I work with researchers
p60
aVat North Carolina State University and the University of Colorado
p61
aVto uncover the microscopic life that is nearest us,
p62
aVand that's often in our most intimate and boring environments,
p63
aVbe it under our couches, in our backyards,
p64
aVor in our belly buttons.
p65
aVI do this work because it turns out that we know very little
p66
aVabout the microscopic life that's nearest us.
p67
aVAs of a few years ago, no scientist could tell you
p68
aVwhat bugs or microorganisms live in your home \u2014
p69
aVyour home, the place you know better than anywhere else.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd so I and teams of others
p72
aVare armed with Q-tips and tweezers
p73
aVand advanced DNA techniques
p74
aVto uncover the microscopic life nearest us.
p75
aVIn doing so, we found over 600 species of bugs
p76
aVthat live in USA homes,
p77
aVeverything from spiders and cockroaches
p78
aVto tiny mites that cling to feathers.
p79
aVAnd we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi
p80
aVthat live in our dust bunnies,
p81
aVthousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers.
p82
aVWe've gone further still,
p83
aVand we looked at the microorganisms
p84
aVthat live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home.
p85
aVIn each bug, for example, a wasp,
p86
aVwe see a microscopic jungle unfold in a petri plate,
p87
aVa world of hundreds of vibrant species.
p88
aVBehold the biological cosmos!
p89
aVSo many of the species you're looking at right now
p90
aVdon't yet have names.
p91
aVMost of the life around us remains unknown.
p92
aa(lp93
VI remember the first time I discovered and got to name a new species.
p94
aVIt was a fungus that lives in the nest of a paper wasp.
p95
aVIt's white and fluffy,
p96
aVand I named it "mucor nidicola,"
p97
aVmeaning in Latin that it lives in the nest of another.
p98
aVThis is a picture of it growing on a dinosaur,
p99
aVbecause everyone thinks dinosaurs are cool.
p100
aVAt the time, I was in graduate school,
p101
aVand I was so excited that I had found this new life form.
p102
aVI called up my dad, and I go,
p103
aV"Dad! I just discovered a new microorganism species."
p104
aVAnd he laughed and he goes,
p105
aV"That's great. I hope you also discovered a cure for it."
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
V"Cure it."
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, my dad is my biggest fan,
p112
aVso in that crushing moment where he wanted to kill my new little life form,
p113
aVI realized that actually I had failed him,
p114
aVboth as a daughter and a scientist.
p115
aVIn my years toiling away in labs and in people's backyards,
p116
aVinvestigating and cataloging the microscopic life around us,
p117
aVI'd never made clear my true mission to him.
p118
aVMy goal is not to find technology
p119
aVto kill the new microscopic life around us.
p120
aVMy goal is to find new technology from this life, that will help save us.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe diversity of life in our homes is more than a list of 100,000 new species.
p123
aVIt is 100,000 new sources of solutions to human problems.
p124
aVI know it's hard to believe that anything that's so small
p125
aVor only has one cell
p126
aVcan do anything powerful,
p127
aVbut they can.
p128
aVThese creatures are microscopic alchemists,
p129
aVwith the ability to transform their environment
p130
aVwith an arsenal of chemical tools.
p131
aVThis means that they can live anywhere on this planet,
p132
aVand they can eat whatever food is around them.
p133
aVThis means they can eat everything from toxic waste to plastic,
p134
aVand they can produce waste products like oil and battery power
p135
aVand even tiny nuggets of real gold.
p136
aVThey can transform the inedible into nutritive.
p137
aVThey can make sugar into alcohol.
p138
aVThey give chocolate its flavor,
p139
aVand soil the power to grow.
p140
aa(lp141
VI'm here to tell you
p142
aVthat the next 100 years will feature these microscopic creatures
p143
aVsolving more of our problems.
p144
aVAnd we have a lot of problems to choose from.
p145
aVWe've got the mundane: bad-smelling clothes or bland food.
p146
aVAnd we've got the monumental:
p147
aVdisease, pollution, war.
p148
aVAnd so this is my mission:
p149
aVto not just catalog the microscopic life around us,
p150
aVbut to find out what it's uniquely well-suited to help us with.
p151
aa(lp152
VHere's an example.
p153
aVWe started with a pest,
p154
aVa wasp that lives on many of our homes.
p155
aVInside that wasp, we plucked out a little-known microorganism species
p156
aVwith a unique ability:
p157
aVit could make beer.
p158
aVThis is a trait that only a few species on this planet have.
p159
aVIn fact, all commercially produced beer you've ever had
p160
aVlikely came from one of only three microorganism species.
p161
aVYet our species, it could make a beer that tasted like honey,
p162
aVand it could also make a delightfully tart beer.
p163
aVIn fact, this microorganism species that lives in the belly of a wasp,
p164
aVit could make a valuable sour beer
p165
aVbetter than any other species on this planet.
p166
aVThere are now four species that produce commercial beer.
p167
aVWhere you used to see a pest,
p168
aVnow think of tasting your future favorite beer.
p169
aa(lp170
VAs a second example,
p171
aVI worked with researchers to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.
p172
aVThere, we uncovered a microorganism that could make novel antibiotics,
p173
aVantibiotics that can kill the world's worst superbugs.
p174
aVThis was an awesome thing to find,
p175
aVbut here's the secret:
p176
aVfor the last 60 years,
p177
aVmost of the antibiotics on the market
p178
aVhave come from similar soil bacteria.
p179
aVEvery day, you and I and everyone in this room
p180
aVand on this planet,
p181
aVare saved by similar soil bacteria that produce most of our antibiotics.
p182
aVWhere you used to see dirt,
p183
aVnow think of medication.
p184
aa(lp185
VPerhaps my favorite example comes from colleagues
p186
aVwho are studying a pond scum microorganism,
p187
aVwhich is tragically named after the cow dung it was first found in.
p188
aVIt's pretty unremarkable and would be unworthy of discussion,
p189
aVexcept that the researchers found that if you feed it to mice,
p190
aVit vaccinates against PTSD.
p191
aVIt vaccinates against fear.
p192
aVWhere you used to see pond scum, now think of hope.
p193
aa(lp194
VThere are so many more microbial examples
p195
aVthat I don't have time to talk about today.
p196
aVI gave you examples of solutions that came from just three species,
p197
aVbut imagine what those other 100,000 species in your dust bunnies
p198
aVmight be able to do.
p199
aVIn the future, they might be able to make you sexier
p200
aVor smarter
p201
aVor perhaps live longer.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo I want you to look at your finger again.
p204
aVThink about all those microscopic creatures
p205
aVthat are unknown.
p206
aVThink about in the future what they might be able to do
p207
aVor make
p208
aVor whose life they might be able to save.
p209
aVHow does your finger feel right now?
p210
aVA little bit powerful?
p211
aVThat's because you're feeling the future.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.
