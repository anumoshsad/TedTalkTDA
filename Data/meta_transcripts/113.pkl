VThat splendid music, the coming-in music,
p4
aV"The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd you can see why. It's triumphal.
p9
aVI won't feel anything, but if I could,
p10
aVI would feel triumphal at having lived at all,
p11
aVand at having lived on this splendid planet,
p12
aVand having been given the opportunity to understand
p13
aVsomething about why I was here in the first place, before not being here.
p14
aa(lp15
VCan you understand my quaint English accent?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VLike everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session.
p20
aVRobert Full and Frans Lanting and others;
p21
aVthe beauty of the things that they showed.
p22
aVThe only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,
p23
aV"the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth."
p24
aVNow of course, we know that he didn't really mean that,
p25
aVbut in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VI'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design,
p30
aVDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
p31
aVIn professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
p32
aVIn non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.
p33
aVBut in non-professional circles within America,
p34
aVit arouses so much hostility \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
Vit's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war.
p39
aVThe war is so worrying at present,
p40
aVwith court cases coming up in one state after another,
p41
aVthat I felt I had to say something about it.
p42
aa(lp43
VIf you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself,
p44
aVI'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books,
p45
aVwhich you won't find in the bookstore outside.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VContemporary court cases
p50
aVoften concern an allegedly new version of creationism,
p51
aVcalled "Intelligent Design," or ID.
p52
aVDon't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID.
p53
aVIt's just creationism under another name,
p54
aVrechristened \u2014 I choose the word advisedly \u2014
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
Vfor tactical, political reasons.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe arguments of so-called ID theorists
p61
aVare the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again,
p62
aVsince Darwin down to the present day.
p63
aVThere is an effective evolution lobby
p64
aVcoordinating the fight on behalf of science,
p65
aVand I try to do all I can to help them,
p66
aVbut they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention
p67
aVthat we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists.
p68
aVThey see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why.
p69
aVCreationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case,
p70
aVfall back on the popular phobia against atheism:
p71
aVTeach your children evolution in biology class,
p72
aVand they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VIn fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down
p77
aVare firm in their support of evolution.
p78
aVThis book, "Finding Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,
p79
aVis one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know
p80
aVand it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian.
p81
aVPeople like Kenneth Miller could be called a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
Vbecause they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,
p86
aVtantamount to atheism.
p87
aVPeople like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut here, I want to say something nice about creationists.
p90
aVIt's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VI think they're right about one thing.
p95
aVI think they're right that evolution
p96
aVis fundamentally hostile to religion.
p97
aa(lp98
VI've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope,
p99
aVare also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves.
p100
aVI believe a true understanding of Darwinism
p101
aVis deeply corrosive to religious faith.
p102
aVNow, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism,
p103
aVand I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do.
p104
aVIn an audience as sophisticated as this one,
p105
aVthat would be preaching to the choir.
p106
aa(lp107
VNo, what I want to urge upon you \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VInstead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VBut that's putting it too negatively.
p118
aVIf I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith,
p119
aVI would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science,
p120
aVand indeed science generally, but evolution in particular,
p121
aVto inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design
p124
aVis to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.
p125
aVStatistical improbability in the direction of good design \u2014
p126
aV"complexity" is another word for this.
p127
aVThe standard creationist argument \u2014
p128
aVthere is only one; they're all reduced to this one \u2014
p129
aVtakes off from a statistical improbability.
p130
aVLiving creatures are too complex to have come about by chance;
p131
aVtherefore, they must have had a designer.
p132
aVThis argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.
p133
aVAny designer capable of designing something really complex
p134
aVhas to be even more complex himself,
p135
aVand that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do,
p136
aVlike forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers \u2014
p137
aVfavor our side in a war \u2014
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
Vdisapprove of our sex lives, and so on.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VComplexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve,
p146
aVand you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex,
p147
aVthereby simply compounding the problem.
p148
aVDarwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant
p149
aVbecause it solves the problem of explaining complexity
p150
aVin terms of nothing but simplicity.
p151
aVEssentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp
p152
aVof gradual, step-by-step increment.
p153
aVBut here, I only want to make the point
p154
aVthat the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion,
p155
aVprecisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful,
p156
aVso economically powerful.
p157
aVIt has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe God theory is not just a bad theory.
p160
aVIt turns out to be \u2014 in principle \u2014
p161
aVincapable of doing the job required of it.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby,
p164
aVI want to argue that rocking the boat
p165
aVmay be just the right thing to do.
p166
aVMy approach to attacking creationism is \u2014
p167
aVunlike the evolution lobby \u2014
p168
aVmy approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole.
p169
aVAnd at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo
p170
aVagainst speaking ill of religion,
p171
aVand I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams,
p172
aVa dear friend who, if he never came to TED,
p173
aVcertainly should have been invited.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)
p176
aa(lp177
VRichard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been.
p178
aa(lp179
VHe begins this speech, which was tape recorded in Cambridge
p180
aVshortly before he died \u2014
p181
aVhe begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses
p182
aVthat are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on.
p183
aa(lp184
VI quote, "Religion doesn't seem to work like that.
p185
aVIt has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'
p186
aVWhat it means is: here is an idea or a notion
p187
aVthat you're not allowed to say anything bad about.
p188
aVYou're just not. Why not? Because you're not."
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
V"Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate
p193
aVto support the Republicans or Democrats,
p194
aVthis model of economics versus that,
p195
aVMacintosh instead of Windows,
p196
aVbut to have an opinion about how the universe began,
p197
aVabout who created the universe \u2014
p198
aVno, that's holy.
p199
aVSo, we're used to not challenging religious ideas,
p200
aVand it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates
p201
aVwhen he does it." \u2014
p202
aa(lp203
VHe meant me, not that one.
p204
aa(lp205
V"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it,
p206
aVbecause you're not allowed to say these things.
p207
aVYet when you look at it rationally,
p208
aVthere's no reason why those ideas
p209
aVshouldn't be as open to debate as any other,
p210
aVexcept that we've agreed somehow between us
p211
aVthat they shouldn't be."
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd that's the end of the quote from Douglas.
p214
aa(lp215
VIn my view, not only is science corrosive to religion;
p216
aVreligion is corrosive to science.
p217
aVIt teaches people to be satisfied with trivial,
p218
aVsupernatural non-explanations,
p219
aVand blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations
p220
aVthat we have within our grasp.
p221
aVIt teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith,
p222
aVinstead of always insisting on evidence.
p223
aa(lp224
VThere's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, "Last Chance to See."
p225
aVNow, there's a typical scientific journal,
p226
aVThe Quarterly Review of Biology.
p227
aVAnd I'm going to put together, as guest editor,
p228
aVa special issue on the question, "Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"
p229
aVAnd the first paper is a standard scientific paper,
p230
aVpresenting evidence,
p231
aV"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,
p232
aVand potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan,
p233
aVindicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p234
aVPerfectly ordinary scientific paper.
p235
aVNow, the next one.
p236
aV"The President of the Royal Society
p237
aVhas been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction
p238
aVthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
V"It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane
p243
aa(lp244
Vthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V"Professor Hordley was brought up
p249
aVto have total and unquestioning faith" \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter) \u2014
p252
aa(lp253
V"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p254
aV"Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma
p255
aVbinding on all loyal Hawkinsians
p256
aVthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VThat's inconceivable, of course.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut suppose \u2014
p263
aa(lp264
V[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens]
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VIn 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.
p271
aVwhether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism
p272
aVof Americans who are atheists.
p273
aVMr. Bush's reply has become infamous.
p274
aV"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens,
p275
aVnor should they be considered patriots.
p276
aVThis is one nation under God."
p277
aa(lp278
VBush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake,
p279
aVblurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted.
p280
aVHe stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal.
p281
aVHe really meant it.
p282
aVMore to the point, he knew it posed no threat to his election \u2014
p283
aVquite the contrary.
p284
aVDemocrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness
p285
aVif they want to get elected.
p286
aVBoth parties invoke "one nation under God."
p287
aVWhat would Thomas Jefferson have said?
p288
aa(lp289
V[In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty]
p290
aa(lp291
VIncidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British,
p292
aVbut you can't help making the comparison.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VIn practice, what is an atheist?
p297
aVAn atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh
p298
aVthe way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.
p299
aVAs has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods
p300
aVthat humanity has ever believed in.
p301
aVSome of us just go one god further.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief
p308
aVthat a person is entitled to hold without being vilified
p309
aVas an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen.
p310
aVNevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist
p311
aVis tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.
p312
aVAnd that all stems from the perception of atheists
p313
aVas some kind of weird, way-out minority.
p314
aa(lp315
VNatalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker,
p316
aVsaying how lonely she felt as an atheist.
p317
aVShe clearly feels in a beleaguered minority.
p318
aVBut actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically?
p319
aVThe latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.
p320
aVChristianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population,
p321
aVwith nearly 160 million.
p322
aVBut what would you think was the second largest group,
p323
aVconvincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,
p324
aVHindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together?
p325
aVThe second largest group, with nearly 30 million,
p326
aVis the one described as non-religious or secular.
p327
aa(lp328
VYou can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians
p329
aVare so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby \u2014
p330
aVthe state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote \u2014
p331
aVwhile at the same time,
p332
aVconsigning the non-religious to political oblivion.
p333
aVThis secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized,
p334
aVis nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote.
p335
aVWhy does this far more substantial minority
p336
aVnot make a move to exercise its political muscle?
p337
aa(lp338
VWell, so much for quantity. How about quality?
p339
aVIs there any correlation, positive or negative,
p340
aVbetween intelligence and tendency to be religious?
p341
aa(lp342
V[Them folks misunderestimated me]
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VThe survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey,
p347
aVdidn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education,
p348
aVIQ or anything else.
p349
aVBut a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine
p350
aVprovides some straws in the wind.
p351
aVMensa, as you know, is an international organization
p352
aVfor people with very high IQ.
p353
aVAnd from a meta-analysis of the literature,
p354
aVBell concludes that, I quote \u2014 "Of 43 studies carried out since 1927
p355
aVon the relationship between religious belief,
p356
aVand one's intelligence or educational level,
p357
aVall but four found an inverse connection.
p358
aVThat is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level,
p359
aVthe less one is likely to be religious."
p360
aVWell, I haven't seen the original 42 studies,
p361
aVand I can't comment on that meta-analysis,
p362
aVbut I would like to see more studies done along those lines.
p363
aVAnd I know that there are \u2014 if I could put a little plug here \u2014
p364
aVthere are people in this audience
p365
aVeasily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question,
p366
aVand I put the suggestion up, for what it's worth.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut let me know show you some data
p369
aVthat have been properly published and analyzed,
p370
aVon one special group \u2014 namely, top scientists.
p371
aVIn 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists,
p372
aVthose who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences,
p373
aVand among this select group,
p374
aVbelief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.
p375
aVAbout 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists.
p376
aVSimilar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality.
p377
aVAmong biological scientists, the figure is even lower:
p378
aV5.5 percent, only, believe in God.
p379
aVPhysical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.
p380
aVI've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars
p381
aVin other fields, such as history or philosophy,
p382
aVbut I'd be surprised if they were different.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo, we've reached a truly remarkable situation,
p385
aVa grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia
p386
aVand the American electorate.
p387
aVA philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe,
p388
aVwhich is held by the vast majority of top American scientists
p389
aVand probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally,
p390
aVis so abhorrent to the American electorate
p391
aVthat no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public.
p392
aVIf I'm right, this means that high office
p393
aVin the greatest country in the world
p394
aVis barred to the very people best qualified to hold it \u2014
p395
aVthe intelligentsia \u2014
p396
aVunless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs.
p397
aVTo put it bluntly: American political opportunities
p398
aVare heavily loaded against those
p399
aVwho are simultaneously intelligent and honest.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VI'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming
p406
aVif I suggest that something needs to be done.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd I've already hinted what that something is.
p411
aVFrom what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it.
p412
aVAgain, I fear it will cost money.
p413
aVWe need a consciousness-raising,
p414
aVcoming-out campaign for American atheists.
p415
aa(lp416
V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
VThis could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals
p419
aVa few years ago,
p420
aValthough heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing
p421
aVof people against their will.
p422
aVIn most cases, people who out themselves
p423
aVwill help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.
p424
aa(lp425
VOn the contrary,
p426
aVthey'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people
p427
aVwho could serve as decent role models for your children,
p428
aVthe kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product,
p429
aVthe kinds of people who are sitting in this room.
p430
aVThere should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback,
p431
aVsuch that the more names we have, the more we get.
p432
aVThere could be non-linearities, threshold effects.
p433
aVWhen a critical mass has been obtained,
p434
aVthere's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment.
p435
aVAnd again, it will need money.
p436
aa(lp437
VI suspect that the word "atheist" itself
p438
aVcontains or remains a stumbling block
p439
aVfar out of proportion to what it actually means,
p440
aVand a stumbling block to people
p441
aVwho otherwise might be happy to out themselves.
p442
aVSo, what other words might be used to smooth the path,
p443
aVoil the wheels, sugar the pill?
p444
aVDarwin himself preferred "agnostic" \u2014
p445
aVand not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley,
p446
aVwho coined the term.
p447
aa(lp448
VDarwin said, "I have never been an atheist
p449
aVin the same sense of denying the existence of a God.
p450
aVI think that generally an 'agnostic'
p451
aVwould be the most correct description of my state of mind."
p452
aa(lp453
VHe even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling.
p454
aVAveling was a militant atheist
p455
aVwho failed to persuade Darwin
p456
aVto accept the dedication of his book on atheism \u2014
p457
aVincidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth
p458
aVthat Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin,
p459
aVwhich he didn't, it was actually Edward Aveling.
p460
aVWhat happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter,
p461
aVand when both Darwin and Marx were dead,
p462
aVMarx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers,
p463
aVand a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much
p464
aVbut I don't want you to dedicate your book to me,"
p465
aVwas mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx,
p466
aVand that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard.
p467
aVIt's a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

VAnyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.
p470
aV"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"
p471
aV"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was simply 'atheist' writ respectable,
p472
aVand 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive."
p473
aVDarwin complained, "But why should you be so aggressive?"
p474
aVDarwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia,
p475
aVbut that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it."
p476
aVWhich is, of course, our old friend, the "don't rock the boat" argument.
p477
aVIt's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VBut in any case, that was more than 100 years ago.
p482
aVYou'd think we might have grown up since then.
p483
aVNow, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,
p484
aVwho, incidentally, observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity,
p485
aVdescribes himself as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."
p486
aVHe won't call himself an atheist
p487
aVbecause it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative,
p488
aVbut "agnostic" on its own might suggest that God's existence
p489
aVwas therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.
p490
aa(lp491
VSo, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy,
p492
aVbut it isn't very likely, is it?
p493
aVLike God.
p494
aVHence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."
p495
aVBertrand Russell made the same point
p496
aVusing a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars.
p497
aVYou would strictly have to be agnostic
p498
aVabout whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars,
p499
aVbut that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence
p500
aVas on all fours with its non-existence.
p501
aa(lp502
VThe list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about
p503
aVdoesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite.
p504
aVIf you want to believe one particular one of them \u2014
p505
aVunicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh \u2014
p506
aVthe onus is on you to say why.
p507
aVThe onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.
p508
aVWe, who are atheists,
p509
aVare also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.
p510
aa(lp511
V(Laughter)
p512
aa(lp513
VBut we don't bother to say so.
p514
aVAnd this is why my friend uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"
p515
aVas a label for what most people would call atheist.
p516
aVNonetheless, if we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly,
p517
aVwe're going to have find something better to stick on our banner
p518
aVthan "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."
p519
aa(lp520
VSo, how about "humanist"?
p521
aVThis has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations
p522
aVand journals and things already in place.
p523
aVMy problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism.
p524
aVOne of the things we've learned from Darwin
p525
aVis that the human species is only one
p526
aVamong millions of cousins, some close, some distant.
p527
aa(lp528
VAnd there are other possibilities, like "naturalist,"
p529
aVbut that also has problems of confusion,
p530
aVbecause Darwin would have thought naturalist \u2014
p531
aV"Naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" \u2014
p532
aVand it is used sometimes \u2014
p533
aVDarwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist,"
p534
aVwhich he was, of course,
p535
aVand I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with "nudism".
p536
aa(lp537
V(Laughter)
p538
aa(lp539
VSuch people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob,
p540
aVwhich last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.
p541
aa(lp542
V(Laughter)
p543
aa(lp544
VI think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist"
p545
aVis simply "non-theist."
p546
aVIt lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God,
p547
aVand it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.
p548
aVIt's completely compatible with the God of the physicists.
p549
aVWhen atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"
p550
aVthey use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand
p551
aVfor that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.
p552
aV"Non-theist" will do for all that, yet unlike "atheist,"
p553
aVit doesn't have the same phobic, hysterical responses.
p554
aVBut I think, actually, the alternative
p555
aVis to grasp the nettle of the word "atheism" itself,
p556
aVprecisely because it is a taboo word,
p557
aVcarrying frissons of hysterical phobia.
p558
aVCritical mass may be harder to achieve with the word "atheist"
p559
aVthan with the word "non-theist,"
p560
aVor some other non-confrontational word.
p561
aVBut if we did achieve it with that dread word "atheist" itself,
p562
aVthe political impact would be even greater.
p563
aa(lp564
VNow, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution \u2014
p565
aVI'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood.
p566
aVAnd this is because the scientific worldview
p567
aVis so much more exciting, more poetic,
p568
aVmore filled with sheer wonder
p569
aVthan anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination.
p570
aVAs Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it,
p571
aV"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science
p572
aVand concluded, 'This is better than we thought!
p573
aVThe universe is much bigger than our prophet said,
p574
aVgrander, more subtle, more elegant'?
p575
aVInstead they say, 'No, no, no!
p576
aVMy god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.'
p577
aVA religion, old or new,
p578
aVthat stressed the magnificence of the universe
p579
aVas revealed by modern science,
p580
aVmight be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe
p581
aVhardly tapped by the conventional faiths."
p582
aa(lp583
VNow, this is an elite audience,
p584
aVand I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious.
p585
aVMany of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief
p586
aVthat we should respect religion.
p587
aVBut I also suspect that a fair number of those
p588
aVsecretly despise religion as much as I do.
p589
aa(lp590
V(Laughter)
p591
aa(lp592
VIf you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be,
p593
aVbut if you are one of them,
p594
aVI'm asking you to stop being polite,
p595
aVcome out, and say so.
p596
aVAnd if you happen to be rich,
p597
aVgive some thought to ways in which you might make a difference.
p598
aVThe religious lobby in this country
p599
aVis massively financed by foundations \u2014 to say nothing of all the tax benefits \u2014
p600
aVby foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
p601
aVWe need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
p602
aVIf my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books,
p603
aVinstead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.
p604
aa(lp605
VPeople are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?"
p606
aa(lp607
VWell, here's how it changed me.
p608
aa(lp609
VLet's all stop being so damned respectful.
p610
aa(lp611
VThank you very much.
