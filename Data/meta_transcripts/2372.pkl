VReligion is more than belief.
p4
aVIt's power, and it's influence.
p5
aVAnd that influence affects all of us,
p6
aVevery day, regardless of your own belief.
p7
aVDespite the enormous influence of religion on the world today,
p8
aVwe hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability
p9
aVthan any other sector of our society.
p10
aVFor example, if there were a multinational organization,
p11
aVgovernment or corporation today
p12
aVthat said no female could be on a leadership board,
p13
aVnot one woman could have a decision-making authority,
p14
aVnot one woman could handle any financial matter,
p15
aVwe would have outrage.
p16
aVThere would be sanctions.
p17
aVAnd yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe accept things in our religious lives
p20
aVthat we do not accept in our secular lives,
p21
aVand I know this because I've been doing it for three decades.
p22
aVI was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up.
p23
aVI played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself.
p24
aVI said I was going to be the first female President of the United States.
p25
aVI have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment,
p26
aVwhich has been dead for 40 years.
p27
aVI'm the first woman in both sides of my family
p28
aVto ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.
p29
aa(lp30
VI never accepted being excluded because I was a woman,
p31
aVexcept in my religion.
p32
aVThroughout all of that time,
p33
aVI was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion.
p34
aVI grew up in an enormously traditional family.
p35
aVI have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother.
p36
aVMy father's actually a religious leader in the community.
p37
aVAnd I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing
p38
aVwas in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life.
p39
aVYou get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol,
p40
aVyou don't smoke, you always do service,
p41
aVyou're a good kid.
p42
aVSome of the rules we had were strict,
p43
aVbut you followed the rules because you loved the people
p44
aVand you loved the religion and you believed.
p45
aa(lp46
VEverything about Mormonism determined what you wore,
p47
aVwho you dated, who you married.
p48
aVIt determined what underwear we wore.
p49
aVI was the kind of religious where everyone I know
p50
aVdonated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church,
p51
aVincluding myself.
p52
aVFrom paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent.
p53
aVI was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children
p54
aVwhen they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission
p55
aVthat they would rather have them die
p56
aVthan return home without honor, having sinned.
p57
aVI was the type and the kind of religious
p58
aVwhere kids kill themselves every single year
p59
aVbecause they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay.
p60
aVBut I was also the kind of religious
p61
aVwhere it didn't matter where in the world I lived,
p62
aVI had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid.
p63
aVThis was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life.
p64
aVI had help raising my little daughter.
p65
aVSo that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead,
p66
aVand I accepted without question
p67
aVthat women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth,
p68
aVwhich we call the priesthood.
p69
aVAnd I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets,
p70
aVdisciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities,
p71
aVand I gave my religion a free pass
p72
aVbecause I loved it.
p73
aa(lp74
VUntil I stopped,
p75
aVand I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated
p76
aVas the support staff to the real work of men.
p77
aVAnd I faced this contradiction in myself,
p78
aVand I joined with other activists in my community.
p79
aVWe've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe first thing we did was raise consciousness.
p82
aVYou can't change what you can't see.
p83
aVWe started podcasting, blogging, writing articles.
p84
aVI created lists of hundreds of ways
p85
aVthat men and women are unequal in our community.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe next thing we did was build advocacy organizations.
p88
aVWe tried to do things that were unignorable,
p89
aVlike wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings.
p90
aVThese seem like simple things,
p91
aVbut to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly.
p92
aVWe lost relationships. We lost jobs.
p93
aVWe got hate mail on a daily basis.
p94
aVWe were attacked in social media and national press.
p95
aVWe received death threats.
p96
aVWe lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated.
p97
aVMost of us got put in front of a disciplinary council,
p98
aVand were rejected from the communities that we loved
p99
aVbecause we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I began to expect this reaction from my own people.
p102
aVI know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you
p103
aVor criticize you.
p104
aVBut what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work
p105
aVI received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left,
p106
aVthe same vehemence as the religious right.
p107
aVAnd what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility,
p108
aVthese phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid."
p109
aV"Don't pay attention to religion."
p110
aV"They're going to be homophobic and sexist."
p111
aVWhat they didn't understand
p112
aVwas that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism,
p113
aVit bred religious extremism.
p114
aVThose arguments don't work, and I know because I remember
p115
aVsomeone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon.
p116
aVAnd what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people
p117
aVand everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments.
p120
aVWhen I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle,
p121
aVbecause I have family and friends.
p122
aVThese are my people, and I'm the first to defend them,
p123
aVbut the struggle is real.
p124
aVHow do we respect someone's religious beliefs
p125
aVwhile still holding them accountable for the harm or damage
p126
aVthat those beliefs may cause others?
p127
aVIt's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer.
p128
aVMy parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade.
p129
aVThey're intelligent people. They're lovely people.
p130
aVAnd let me try to help you understand their perspective.
p131
aVIn Mormonism, we believe that after you die,
p132
aVif you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals,
p133
aVyou can be together as a family again.
p134
aVAnd to my parents, me doing something as simple
p135
aVas having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders,
p136
aVthat makes me unworthy.
p137
aVI won't be with my family in the eternities.
p138
aVBut even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15,
p139
aVand something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family.
p140
aVAnd to my parents, they cannot understand
p141
aVwhy something as simple as fashion or women's rights
p142
aVwould prevent me from seeing my brother again.
p143
aVAnd that's the mindset that we're dealing with,
p144
aVand criticism does not change that.
p145
aVAnd so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope,
p146
aVexplaining our sides, respecting one another,
p147
aVbut actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs
p148
aVby the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult.
p149
aVThe way that we've been able to do that
p150
aVis to get past those defensive shells
p151
aVand really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief
p152
aVand try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox
p155
aVand the religious right, what they all don't understand
p156
aVwas why even care about religious activism?
p157
aVI cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said,
p158
aV"If you don't like religion, just leave."
p159
aVWhy would you try to change it?
p160
aVBecause what is taught on the Sabbath
p161
aVleaks into our politics, our health policy,
p162
aVviolence around the world.
p163
aVIt leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making.
p164
aVThese laws get legally and culturally codified.
p165
aVIn fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation.
p166
aVFor example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars
p167
aVto fight same-sex marriage in California.
p168
aVForty years ago, political historians will say,
p169
aVthat if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,
p170
aVwe'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today.
p171
aVHow many lives did that affect?
p172
aVAnd we can spend time fighting every single one
p173
aVof these little tiny laws and rules,
p174
aVor we can ask ourselves,
p175
aVwhy is gender inequality the default around the world?
p176
aVWhy is that the assumption?
p177
aa(lp178
VBecause religion doesn't just create the roots of morality,
p179
aVit creates the seeds of normality.
p180
aVReligions can liberate or subjugate,
p181
aVthey can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,
p182
aVand the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral
p183
aVare often not those in charge.
p184
aVReligions can't be dismissed or ignored.
p185
aVWe need to take them seriously.
p186
aVBut it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut I'll tell you what my people have done.
p189
aVMy groups are small, there's hundreds of us,
p190
aVbut we've had huge impact.
p191
aVRight now, women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men
p192
aVfor the first time.
p193
aVWomen are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings,
p194
aVand they never were before in the general conferences.
p195
aVAs of last week, in a historic move,
p196
aVthree women were invited down to three leadership boards
p197
aVthat oversee the entire church.
p198
aVWe've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community
p199
aVthat allow for talk of gender inequality.
p200
aVWe've opened up space, regardless of being despised,
p201
aVfor more conservative women to step in and make real changes,
p202
aVand the words "women" and "the priesthood" can now be uttered in the same sentence.
p203
aVI never had that.
p204
aVMy daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had,
p205
aVthat's more equal \u2014 we've had an effect.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt wasn't easy standing in those lines
p208
aVtrying to get into those male meetings.
p209
aVThere were hundreds of us,
p210
aVand one by one, when we got to the door,
p211
aVwe were told, "I'm sorry, this meeting is just for men,"
p212
aVand we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting
p213
aVas young as 12 years old,
p214
aVescorted and walked past us as we all stood in line.
p215
aVBut not one woman in that line will forget that day,
p216
aVand not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day.
p217
aa(lp218
VIf we were a multinational corporation or a government, and that had happened,
p219
aVthere would be outrage,
p220
aVbut we're just a religion.
p221
aVWe're all just part of religions.
p222
aVWe can't keep looking at religion that way,
p223
aVbecause it doesn't only affect me, it affects my daughter
p224
aVand all of your daughters and what opportunities they have,
p225
aVwhat they can wear, who they can love and marry,
p226
aVif they have access to reproductive healthcare.
p227
aVWe need to reclaim morality in a secular context
p228
aVthat creates ethical scrutiny and accountability
p229
aVfor religions all around the world,
p230
aVbut we need to do it in a respectful way
p231
aVthat breeds cooperation and not extremism.
p232
aVAnd we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery,
p233
aVstanding up for gender equality.
p234
aa(lp235
VIt's time that half of the world's population
p236
aVhad voice and equality within our world's religions,
p237
aVchurches, synagogues, mosques and shrines around the world.
p238
aVI'm working on my people. What are you doing for yours?
