VI cannot forget them.
p4
aVTheir names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,
p5
aVFernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,
p6
aVHans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,
p7
aVNancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,
p8
aVand the list is longer.
p9
aVFor many, their existence, their humanity,
p10
aVhas been reduced to statistics,
p11
aVcoldly recorded as "security incidents."
p12
aa(lp13
VFor me, they were colleagues
p14
aVbelonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers
p15
aVthat tried to bring a bit of comfort
p16
aVto the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '90s.
p17
aVThey were nurses, logisticians, shelter experts,
p18
aVparalegals, interpreters.
p19
aVAnd for this service, they were murdered,
p20
aVtheir families torn apart,
p21
aVand their story largely forgotten.
p22
aVNo one was ever sentenced for these crimes.
p23
aa(lp24
VI cannot forget them.
p25
aVThey live in me somehow,
p26
aVtheir memories giving me meaning every day.
p27
aVBut they are also haunting the dark street of my mind.
p28
aa(lp29
VAs humanitarian aid workers,
p30
aVthey made the choice to be at the side of the victim,
p31
aVto provide some assistance, some comfort, some protection,
p32
aVbut when they needed protection themselves,
p33
aVit wasn't there.
p34
aVWhen you see the headlines of your newspaper these days
p35
aVwith the war in Iraq or in Syria \u2014
p36
aVaid worker abducted, hostage executed \u2014
p37
aVbut who were they?
p38
aVWhy were they there?
p39
aVWhat motivated them?
p40
aVHow did we become so indifferent to these crimes?
p41
aVThis is why I am here today with you.
p42
aVWe need to find better ways to remember them.
p43
aVWe also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives.
p44
aVWe also need to demand justice.
p45
aa(lp46
VWhen in '96 I was sent
p47
aVby the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus,
p48
aVI knew some of the risks.
p49
aVFive colleagues had been killed,
p50
aVthree had been seriously injured,
p51
aVseven had already been taken hostage.
p52
aVSo we were careful.
p53
aVWe were using armored  vehicles, decoy cars,
p54
aVchanging patterns of travel, changing homes,
p55
aVall sorts of security measures.
p56
aa(lp57
VYet on a cold winter night of January '98, it was my turn.
p58
aVWhen I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard,
p59
aVwe were surrounded by armed men.
p60
aVThey took the guard, they put him on the floor,
p61
aVthey beat him up in front of me,
p62
aVtied him, dragged him away.
p63
aVI was handcuffed, blindfolded, and forced to kneel,
p64
aVas the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck.
p65
aVWhen it happens to you,
p66
aVthere is no time for thinking, no time for praying.
p67
aVMy brain went on automatic,
p68
aVrewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind.
p69
aVIt took me long minutes to figure out
p70
aVthat those masked men there were not there to kill me,
p71
aVbut that someone, somewhere, had ordered my kidnapping.
p72
aVThen a process of dehumanization started that day.
p73
aVI was no more than just a commodity.
p74
aa(lp75
VI normally don't talk about this,
p76
aVbut I'd like to share a bit with you some of those 317 days of captivity.
p77
aVI was kept in an underground cellar,
p78
aVtotal darkness,
p79
aVfor 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,
p80
aVand then the guards  would come, normally two.
p81
aVThey would bring a big piece of bread,
p82
aVa bowl of soup, and a candle.
p83
aVThat candle would burn for 15 minutes,
p84
aV15 minutes of precious light,
p85
aVand then they would take it away, and I returned to darkness.
p86
aVI was chained by a metal cable to my bed.
p87
aVI could do only four small steps.
p88
aVI always dreamt of the fifth one.
p89
aVAnd no TV, no radio, no newspaper, no one to talk to.
p90
aVI had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,
p91
aVjust two metal buckets open, one for water, for one waste.
p92
aVCan you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards
p93
aVwhen they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk?
p94
aVWe are breaking my nerves very slowly.
p95
aa(lp96
VIsolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe.
p97
aVHow do you describe nothing?
p98
aVThere are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached
p99
aVin that very thin border between sanity and madness.
p100
aVIn the darkness, sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers.
p101
aVI would start with the black,
p102
aVplay with the white,
p103
aVback to the black trying to trick the other side.
p104
aVI don't play checkers anymore.
p105
aVI was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.
p106
aVI didn't know what had happened to him.
p107
aVI was trying not to think,
p108
aVI tried to fill up my time
p109
aVby doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot.
p110
aVI tried to pray, I tried all sorts of memorization games.
p111
aVBut darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal.
p112
aVOne part of your brain wants you to resist, to shout, to cry,
p113
aVand the other part of the brain orders you to shut up
p114
aVand just go through it.
p115
aVIt's a constant internal debate; there is no one to arbitrate.
p116
aa(lp117
VOnce a guard came to me, very aggressively, and he told me,
p118
aV"Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food."
p119
aVI wasn't in a good mood, so I insulted him.
p120
aVI insulted his mother, I insulted his ancestors.
p121
aVThe consequence was moderate: he threw the food into my waste.
p122
aVThe day after he came back with the same demand.
p123
aVHe got the same answer,
p124
aVwhich had the same consequence.
p125
aVFour days later, the body was full of pain.
p126
aVI didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little.
p127
aVSo when the guards came down,
p128
aVI knelt.
p129
aVI begged for my food.
p130
aVSubmission was the only way for me to make it to another candle.
p131
aa(lp132
VAfter my kidnapping,
p133
aVI was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya,
p134
aVthree days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars,
p135
aVand upon arrival, I was interrogated
p136
aVfor 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.
p137
aVThe routine was always the same:
p138
aVa bit more light, 45 minutes.
p139
aVHe would come down to the cellar,
p140
aVhe would ask the guards to tie me on the chair,
p141
aVand he would turn on the music loud.
p142
aVAnd then he would yell questions.
p143
aVHe would scream. He would beat me.
p144
aVI'll spare you the details.
p145
aVThere are many questions I could not understand,
p146
aVand there are some questions I did not want to understand.
p147
aVThe length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape:
p148
aV15 songs, 45 minutes.
p149
aVI would always long for the last song.
p150
aa(lp151
VOn one day, one night in that cellar, I don't know what it was,
p152
aVI heard a child crying above my head,
p153
aVa boy, maybe two or three years old.
p154
aVFootsteps, confusion, people running.
p155
aVSo when Ruslan came the day after,
p156
aVbefore he put the first question to me,
p157
aVI asked him, "How is your son today? Is he feeling better?"
p158
aVRuslan was taken by surprise.
p159
aVHe was furious that the guards may have leaked some details
p160
aVabout his private life.
p161
aVI kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics
p162
aVthat may help his son to get better.
p163
aVAnd we talked about education, we talked about families.
p164
aVHe talked to me about his children.
p165
aVI talked to him about my daughters.
p166
aVAnd then he'd talk about guns, about cars, about women,
p167
aVand I had to talk about guns, about cars, about women.
p168
aVAnd we talked until the last song on the tape.
p169
aVRuslan was the most brutal man I ever met.
p170
aVHe did not touch me anymore.
p171
aVHe did not ask any other questions.
p172
aVI was no longer just a commodity.
p173
aa(lp174
VTwo days after, I was transferred to another place.
p175
aVThere, a guard came to me, very close \u2014 it was quite unusual \u2014
p176
aVand he said with a very soft voice, he said,
p177
aV"I'd like to thank you
p178
aVfor the assistance your organization provided my family
p179
aVwhen we were displaced in nearby Dagestan."
p180
aVWhat could I possibly reply?
p181
aVIt was so painful. It was like a blade in the belly.
p182
aVIt took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile
p183
aVthe good reasons we had to assist that family
p184
aVand the soldier of fortune he became.
p185
aVHe was young, he was shy.
p186
aVI never saw his face.
p187
aVHe probably meant well.
p188
aVBut in those 15 seconds,
p189
aVhe made me question everything we did,
p190
aVall the sacrifices.
p191
aa(lp192
VHe made me think also how they see us.
p193
aVUntil then, I had assumed that they know why we are there
p194
aVand what we are doing.
p195
aVOne cannot assume this.
p196
aVWell, explaining why we do this is not that easy,
p197
aVeven to our closest relatives.
p198
aVWe are not perfect, we are not superior,
p199
aVwe are not the world's fire brigade,
p200
aVwe are not superheroes,
p201
aVwe don't stop wars,
p202
aVwe know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution.
p203
aVYet we do this because one life matters.
p204
aVSometimes that's the only difference you make \u2014
p205
aVone individual, one family, a small group of individuals \u2014
p206
aVand it matters.
p207
aVWhen you have a tsunami, an earthquake or a typhoon,
p208
aVyou see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world,
p209
aVsearching for survivors for weeks.
p210
aVWhy? Nobody questions this.
p211
aVEvery life matters,
p212
aVor every life should matter.
p213
aVThis is the same for us when we help refugees,
p214
aVpeople displaced within their country by conflict, or stateless persons,
p215
aa(lp216
VI know many people,
p217
aVwhen they are confronted by overwhelming suffering,
p218
aVthey feel powerless and they stop there.
p219
aVIt's a pity, because there are so many ways people can help.
p220
aVWe don't stop with that feeling.
p221
aVWe try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance,
p222
aVsome protection, some comfort.
p223
aVWe have to.
p224
aVWe can't do otherwise.
p225
aVIt's what makes us feel, I don't know, simply human.
p226
aa(lp227
VThat's a picture of me the day of my release.
p228
aVMonths after my release, I met the then-French prime minister.
p229
aVThe second thing he told me:
p230
aV"You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus.
p231
aVYou don't know how many problems you've created for us."
p232
aVIt was a short meeting.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VI think helping people in danger is responsible.
p236
aVIn that war, that nobody seriously wanted to stop,
p237
aVand we have many of these today,
p238
aVbringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection
p239
aVwas not just an act of humanity,
p240
aVit was making a real difference for the people.
p241
aVWhy could he not understand this?
p242
aVWe have a responsibility to try.
p243
aVYou've heard about that concept: Responsibility to Protect.
p244
aVOutcomes may depend on various parameters.
p245
aVWe may even fail, but there is worse than failing \u2014
p246
aVit's not even trying when we can.
p247
aa(lp248
VWell, if you are met this way, if you sign up for this sort of job,
p249
aVyour life is going to be full of joy and sadness,
p250
aVbecause there are a lot of people we cannot help,
p251
aVa lot of people we cannot protect, a lot of people we did not save.
p252
aVI call them my ghost,
p253
aVand by having witnessed their suffering from close,
p254
aVyou take a bit  of that suffering on yourself.
p255
aVMany young humanitarian workers
p256
aVgo through their first experience with a lot of bitterness.
p257
aVThey are thrown into situations where they are witness,
p258
aVbut they are powerless to bring any change.
p259
aVThey have to learn to accept it
p260
aVand gradually turn this into positive energy.
p261
aVIt's difficult.
p262
aVMany don't succeed,
p263
aVbut for those who do, there is no other job like this.
p264
aVYou can see the difference you make every day.
p265
aa(lp266
VHumanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking
p267
aVin conflict areas or  in post-conflict environments,
p268
aVyet our life, our job, is becoming  increasingly life-threatening,
p269
aVand the sanctity of our life is fading.
p270
aVDo you know that since the millennium,
p271
aVthe number of attacks on humanitarian  aid workers has tripled?
p272
aV2013 broke new records:
p273
aV155 colleagues killed,
p274
aV171 seriously wounded,
p275
aV134 abducted.
p276
aVSo many broken lives.
p277
aVUntil the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '80s,
p278
aVhumanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims
p279
aVof what we call collateral damages,
p280
aVbut by and large we were not the target of these attacks.
p281
aVThis has changed.
p282
aVLook at this picture.
p283
aVBaghdad, August 2003:
p284
aV24 colleagues were killed.
p285
aVGone are the days when a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross
p286
aVwould automatically protect us.
p287
aa(lp288
VCriminal groups and some political groups
p289
aVhave cross-fertilized over the last 20 years,
p290
aVand they've created these sort of hybrids
p291
aVwith whom we have no way of communicating.
p292
aVHumanitarian principles are tested, questioned, and often ignored,
p293
aVbut perhaps more importantly, we have abandoned the search for justice.
p294
aVThere seems to be no consequence whatsoever
p295
aVfor attacks against humanitarian aid workers.
p296
aVAfter my release, I was told not to seek any form of justice.
p297
aVIt won't do you any good, that's what I was told.
p298
aVPlus, you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues.
p299
aVIt took me years to see the sentencing
p300
aa(lp301
Vof three people associated  with my kidnapping,
p302
aVbut this was the exception.
p303
aVThere was no justice for any  of the humanitarian aid workers
p304
aVkilled or abducted in Chechnya between '95 and '99,
p305
aVand it's the same all over the world.
p306
aVThis is unacceptable.
p307
aVThis is inexcusable.
p308
aVAttacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law.
p309
aVThose crimes should not go unpunished.
p310
aVWe must end this cycle of impunity.
p311
aVWe must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers
p312
aVare attacks against humanity itself.
p313
aVThat makes me furious.
p314
aa(lp315
VI know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for.
p316
aVI don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed.
p317
aVI don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me.
p318
aVI don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country.
p319
aVI also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages.
p320
aVFour days before my eventful release, four hostages were beheaded
p321
aVa few miles away from where I was kept in captivity.
p322
aVWhy them?
p323
aVWhy am I here today?
p324
aVNo easy answer.
p325
aa(lp326
VI was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives,
p327
aVfrom colleagues, from friends, from people I didn't know.
p328
aVThey have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness.
p329
aVNot everyone was treated with the same attention.
p330
aVHow many of my colleagues, after a traumatic incident,
p331
aVtook their own life?
p332
aVI can count nine that I knew personally.
p333
aVHow many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce
p334
aVafter a traumatic experience
p335
aVbecause they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse?
p336
aVI've lost that count.
p337
aVThere is a price for this type of life.
p338
aa(lp339
VIn Russia, all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top.
p340
aVIt says, (In Russian)
p341
aV"No one is forgotten, nothing is forgotten."
p342
aa(lp343
VI do not forget my lost colleagues.
p344
aVI cannot forget anything.
p345
aVI call on you to remember their dedication
p346
aVand demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world
p347
aVbe better protected.
p348
aVWe should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off.
p349
aa(lp350
VAfter my ordeal, a lot of colleagues asked me, "But why do you continue?
p351
aVWhy do you do this sort of job?
p352
aVWhy do you have to go back to it?"
p353
aVMy answer was very simple:
p354
aVIf I had quit,
p355
aVthat would have meant my kidnapper had won.
p356
aVThey would have taken my soul
p357
aVand my humanity.
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you.
