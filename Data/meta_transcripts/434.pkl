VI'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on
p4
aVin the very fabric of the modern economy.
p5
aVAnd to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,
p6
aVbecause in the beginning were commodities.
p7
aVCommodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:
p8
aVbasically, animal, mineral, vegetable.
p9
aVAnd then you extract them out of the ground,
p10
aVand sell them on the open marketplace.
p11
aVCommodities were the basis of the agrarian economy
p12
aVthat lasted for millennia.
p13
aVBut then along came the industrial revolution,
p14
aVand then goods became the predominant economic offering,
p15
aVwhere we used commodities as a raw material
p16
aVto be able to make or manufacture goods.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.
p19
aVWell, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,
p20
aVis that goods have become commoditized.
p21
aVCommoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,
p22
aVwhere people don't care who makes them.
p23
aVThey just care about three things and three things only:
p24
aVprice, price and price.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, there's an antidote to commoditization,
p27
aVand that is customization.
p28
aVMy first book was called "Mass Customization" \u2014
p29
aVit came up a couple of times yesterday \u2014
p30
aVand how I discovered this progression of economic value
p31
aVwas realizing that customizing a good
p32
aVautomatically turned it into a service,
p33
aVbecause it was done just for a particular person,
p34
aVbecause it wasn't inventoried,
p35
aVit was delivered on demand to that individual person.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.
p38
aVBut over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that
p39
aVservices are being commoditized as well.
p40
aVLong-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;
p41
aVfast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;
p42
aVand even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,
p43
aVbut services as well.
p44
aVWhat that means is that it's time
p45
aVto move to a new level of economic value.
p46
aVTime to go beyond the goods and the services,
p47
aVand use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?
p48
aVWhat happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person \u2014
p49
aVthat's exactly what they need at this moment in time?
p50
aVThen you can't help but make them go "wow";
p51
aVyou can't help but turn it into a memorable event \u2014
p52
aVyou can't help but turn it into an experience.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo we're shifting to an experience economy,
p55
aVwhere experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.
p56
aVNow most places that I talk to,
p57
aVwhen I talk about experience, I talk about Disney \u2014
p58
aVthe world's premier experience-stager.
p59
aVI talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,
p60
aVand boutique hotels, and Las Vegas \u2014
p61
aVthe experience capital of the world.
p62
aVBut here, when you think about experiences,
p63
aVthink about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.
p64
aVThink about meaningful places.
p65
aVThink about drinking wine,
p66
aVabout a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
p67
aVThose are all experiences. Think about TED itself.
p68
aVThe experience capital in the world of conferences.
p69
aVAll of these are experiences.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,
p72
aVand particularly in the Netherlands,
p73
aVand whenever I talk about the experience economy there,
p74
aVI'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,
p75
aValmost invariably.
p76
aVAnd the question isn't really so much a question
p77
aVas an accusation.
p78
aVAnd the Dutch, when they usually put it,
p79
aVit always starts with the same two words.
p80
aVYou know the words I mean?
p81
aVYou Americans.
p82
aVThey say, you Americans.
p83
aVYou like your fantasy environments,
p84
aVyour fake, your Disneyland experiences.
p85
aVThey say, we Dutch, we like real,
p86
aVnatural, authentic experiences.
p87
aVSo much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,
p88
aVwhich is: I point out that first of all,
p89
aVyou have to understand that there is no such thing
p90
aVas an inauthentic experience.
p91
aVWhy? Because the experience happens inside of us.
p92
aVIt's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.
p93
aVSo, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,
p94
aVthen every experience we have is authentic.
p95
aVNow, there may be more or less natural or artificial
p96
aVstimuli for the experience,
p97
aVbut even that is a matter of degree, not kind.
p98
aVAnd there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.
p99
aVEven if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,
p100
aVthere is a company that manufactured the car
p101
aVthat delivered you to the edge of the woods;
p102
aVthere's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have
p103
aVto protect yourself from the ground of the woods.
p104
aVThere's a company that provides a cell phone service you have
p105
aVin case you get lost in the woods.
p106
aVRight? All of those are man-made,
p107
aVartificiality brought into the woods by you,
p108
aVand by the very nature of being there.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd then I always finish off
p111
aVby talking about \u2014 the thing that amazes me the most about this question,
p112
aVparticularly coming from the Dutch,
p113
aVis that the Netherlands
p114
aVis every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVAnd the Dutch, they always go ...
p117
aVand they realize, I'm right!
p118
aVThere isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country
p119
aVthat hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,
p120
aVor otherwise moved, modified and manicured
p121
aVto look as if it had always been there.
p122
aVIt's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut nonetheless, not just the Dutch,
p126
aVbut everyone has this desire for the authentic.
p127
aVAnd authenticity is therefore
p128
aVbecoming the new consumer sensibility \u2014
p129
aVthe buying criteria by which consumers
p130
aVare choosing who are they going to buy from,
p131
aVand what they're going to buy.
p132
aVBecoming the basis of the economy.
p133
aVIn fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,
p134
aVthat each one has their own business imperative,
p135
aVmatched with a consumer sensibility.
p136
aVWe're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.
p137
aVIt's about supply and availability.
p138
aVGetting the commodities to market.
p139
aa(lp140
VWith the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs \u2014
p141
aVgetting the costs down as low as possible
p142
aVso we can offer them to the masses.
p143
aVWith the service economy, it is about
p144
aVimproving quality.
p145
aVThat has \u2014 the whole quality movement has risen
p146
aVwith the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd now, with the experience economy,
p149
aVit's about rendering authenticity.
p150
aVRendering authenticity \u2014 and the keyword is "rendering."
p151
aVRight? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers \u2014
p152
aVas business people \u2014
p153
aVto percieve your offerings as authentic.
p154
aVBecause there is a basic paradox:
p155
aVno one can have an inauthentic experience,
p156
aVbut no business can supply one.
p157
aVBecause all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;
p158
aVall business is a matter of using machinery,
p159
aVand all those things make something inauthentic.
p160
aVSo, how do you render authenticity,
p161
aVis the question.
p162
aVAre you rendering authenticity?
p163
aa(lp164
VWhen you think about that, let me go back to
p165
aVwhat Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,
p166
aV"Sincerity and Authenticity" \u2014 came out in 1960 \u2014
p167
aVpoints to as the seminal point
p168
aVat which authenticity entered the lexicon,
p169
aVif you will.
p170
aVAnd that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,
p171
aVand in his play, Hamlet.
p172
aVAnd there is one part in this play, Hamlet,
p173
aVwhere the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,
p174
aVsays something profoundly real.
p175
aVAt the end of a laundry list of advice
p176
aVhe's giving to his son, Laertes,
p177
aVhe says this:
p178
aVAnd this above all: to thine own self be true.
p179
aVAnd it doth follow, as night the day,
p180
aVthat thou canst not then be false to any man.
p181
aVAnd those three verses are the core of authenticity.
p182
aVThere are two dimensions to authenticity:
p183
aVone, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.
p184
aVTwo, is other-directed:
p185
aVbeing what you say you are to others.
p186
aVAnd I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,
p187
aVI immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!
p188
aVAll right? Anybody else like that, no?
p189
aVWell, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get
p190
aVa two-by-two.
p191
aVWhere, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.
p192
aVAs businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing \u2014
p193
aVare they true to themselves?
p194
aVAnd the other dimension is:
p195
aVare they what they say they are to others?
p196
aVIf not, you have,
p197
aV"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"
p198
aVyielding a two-by-two matrix.
p199
aVAnd of course, if you are both true to yourself,
p200
aVand are what you say you are, then you're real real!
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VThe opposite, of course, is \u2014 fake fake.
p204
aVAll right, now, there is value for fake.
p205
aVThere will always be companies around to supply the fake,
p206
aVbecause there will always be desire for the fake.
p207
aVFact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;
p208
aVif you do like it, it's faux.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, the other two sides of the coin are:
p212
aVbeing a real fake \u2014
p213
aVis what it says it is,
p214
aVbut is not true to itself,
p215
aVor being a fake real:
p216
aVis true to itself, but not what it says it is.
p217
aVYou can think about those two \u2014 you know, both of these
p218
aVbetter than being fake fake \u2014 not quite as good as being real real.
p219
aVYou can contrast them by thinking about
p220
aVUniversal City Walk versus
p221
aVDisney World, or Disneyland.
p222
aVUniversal City Walk is a real fake \u2014
p223
aVin fact, we got this very term
p224
aVfrom Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."
p225
aVA wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as \u2014
p226
aVyou know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,
p227
aVright, because you can see behind the facade, right?
p228
aVIt is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;
p229
aVit's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.
p230
aVRight? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,
p231
aVwell, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,
p232
aVoutside in this city.
p233
aVBut is it really true to itself?
p234
aVRight? Is it really in the city?
p235
aVIs it \u2014
p236
aVyou can see behind all of it,
p237
aVand see what is going on in the facades of it.
p238
aVSo she calls it a real fake.
p239
aa(lp240
VDisney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,
p241
aVor a fake reality.
p242
aVRight? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVBut it is \u2014 oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to \u2014
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aV\u2014 sorry.
p247
aVWe won't talk about Santa Claus then.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVBut Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.
p250
aVRight? Just wonderfully true to itself.
p251
aVWhen you are there you are just immersed
p252
aVin this wonderful environment.
p253
aVSo, it's a fake real.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow the easiest way
p256
aVto fall down in this,
p257
aVand not be real real,
p258
aVright, the easiest way not to be true to yourself
p259
aVis not to understand your heritage,
p260
aVand thereby repudiate that heritage.
p261
aVRight, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.
p262
aVKnowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.
p263
aVAnd what you have done in the past limits what you can do,
p264
aVwhat you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
p265
aVSo, you have to understand that past.
p266
aa(lp267
VThink about Disney again.
p268
aVDisney,
p269
aV10 or 15 years ago, right,
p270
aVthe Disney \u2014 the company that is probably
p271
aVbest-known for family values out there,
p272
aVDisney bought the ABC network.
p273
aVThe ABC network, affectionately known in the trade
p274
aVas the T&A network, right \u2014
p275
aVthat's not too much jargon, is it?
p276
aVRight, the T&A network. Then it bought Miramax,
p277
aVknown for its NC-17 fare,
p278
aVand all of a sudden, families everywhere
p279
aVcouldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.
p280
aVIt was no longer true to its heritage;
p281
aVno longer true to Walt Disney.
p282
aVThat's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,
p283
aVand why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.
p284
aVBecause it is no longer true to itself.
p285
aVSo, understand what \u2014 your past limits what you can do in the future.
p286
aa(lp287
VWhen it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make
p288
aVis that they advertise
p289
aVthings that they are not.
p290
aVThat's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company \u2014
p291
aVadvertizing things that you're not.
p292
aVThink about any hotel, any airline,
p293
aVany hospital.
p294
aVRight, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.
p295
aV(Laughter)
p296
aVBut unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,
p297
aVairline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.
p298
aVThen you have that perception that you are phony.
p299
aVSo, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,
p300
aVis to provide places for people to experience
p301
aVwho you are.
p302
aVFor people to experience who you are.
p303
aVRight, it's not advertising does it.
p304
aa(lp305
VThat's why you have companies like Starbucks,
p306
aVright, that doesn't advertise at all.
p307
aVThey said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.
p308
aVAnd think about the economic value they have provided
p309
aVby that experience.
p310
aVRight? Coffee, at its core, is what?
p311
aVRight? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
p312
aVYou know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?
p313
aVTwo or three cents per cup \u2014 that's what coffee is worth.
p314
aVBut grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,
p315
aVand now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,
p316
aVwhen you treat it as a good.
p317
aVTake that same good,
p318
aVand perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,
p319
aVin a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,
p320
aVyou get 50 cents, maybe a buck
p321
aVper cup of coffee.
p322
aVBut surround the brewing of that coffee
p323
aVwith the ambiance of a Starbucks,
p324
aVwith the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,
p325
aVand now, because of that authentic experience,
p326
aVyou can charge two, three, four, five dollars
p327
aVfor a cup of coffee.
p328
aVSo, authenticity is becoming
p329
aVthe new consumer sensibility.
p330
aa(lp331
VLet me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,
p332
aVwith three rules, three basic rules.
p333
aVOne, don't say you're authentic
p334
aVunless you really are authentic.
p335
aVTwo, it's easier to be authentic
p336
aVif you don't say you're authentic.
p337
aVAnd three, if you say you're authentic,
p338
aVyou better be authentic.
p339
aVAnd then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,
p340
aVlet me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,
p341
aVwhat we \u2014 what will make us happy,
p342
aVis spending our time and our money
p343
aVsatisfying the desire for authenticity.
p344
aVThank you.
