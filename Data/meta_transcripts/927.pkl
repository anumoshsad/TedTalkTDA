VI want to start my talk today with two observations
p4
aVabout the human species.
p5
aVThe first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,
p6
aVand that's that our species, Homo sapiens,
p7
aVis actually really, really smart \u2014
p8
aVlike, ridiculously smart \u2014
p9
aVlike you're all doing things
p10
aVthat no other species on the planet does right now.
p11
aVAnd this is, of course,
p12
aVnot the first time you've probably recognized this.
p13
aVOf course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
p14
aVSo we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
p15
aVYou know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage
p16
aVfrom Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert
p17
aVto point out things like the fact that
p18
aVwe're noble in reason and infinite in faculties
p19
aVand just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet
p20
aVwhen it comes to all things cerebral.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut of course, there's a second observation about the human species
p23
aVthat I want to focus on a little bit more,
p24
aVand that's the fact that
p25
aVeven though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,
p26
aVwe can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb
p27
aVwhen it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
p28
aVNow I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
p29
aVDon't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out
p30
aVon any aspects of your own mistakes.
p31
aVBut of course, just in the last two years
p32
aVwe see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
p33
aVAnd we've watched as the tools we uniquely make
p34
aVto pull the resources out of our environment
p35
aVkind of just blow up in our face.
p36
aVWe've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create \u2014
p37
aVthese markets that were supposed to be foolproof \u2014
p38
aVwe've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,
p41
aVdon't highlight what I think is most embarrassing
p42
aVabout the mistakes that humans make,
p43
aVwhich is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make
p44
aVare really just the result of a couple bad apples
p45
aVor a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
p46
aVBut it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning
p47
aVis that most of us, when put in certain contexts,
p48
aVwill actually make very specific mistakes.
p49
aVThe errors we make are actually predictable.
p50
aVWe make them again and again.
p51
aVAnd they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
p52
aVWhen we get negative feedback,
p53
aVwe still, the next time we're face with a certain context,
p54
aVtend to make the same errors.
p55
aVAnd so this has been a real puzzle to me
p56
aVas a sort of scholar of human nature.
p57
aVWhat I'm most curious about is,
p58
aVhow is a species that's as smart as we are
p59
aVcapable of such bad
p60
aVand such consistent errors all the time?
p61
aa(lp62
VYou know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
p63
aVIn some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
p64
aVAnd having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
p65
aVOne possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
p66
aVBecause we're a smart species,
p67
aVwe can actually create all kinds of environments
p68
aVthat are super, super complicated,
p69
aVsometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,
p70
aVeven though we've actually created them.
p71
aVWe create financial markets that are super complex.
p72
aVWe create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
p73
aVAnd of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,
p74
aVin some sense makes sense that we actually
p75
aVmight mess certain things up.
p76
aVIf this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution
p77
aVto the problem of human error.
p78
aVWe'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out
p79
aVthe kinds of technologies we can't deal with,
p80
aVthe kinds of environments that are bad \u2014
p81
aVget rid of those, design things better,
p82
aVand we should be the noble species
p83
aVthat we expect ourselves to be.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,
p86
aVwhich is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
p87
aVMaybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
p88
aVThis is a hint that I've gotten
p89
aVfrom watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
p90
aVAnd what we see is that people tend to keep making errors
p91
aVexactly the same way, over and over again.
p92
aVIt feels like we might almost just be built
p93
aVto make errors in certain ways.
p94
aVThis is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,
p95
aVbecause, if it's us that's messed up,
p96
aVit's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
p97
aVWe might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone
p98
aVand try to design things around it.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
p101
aVHow can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
p102
aVWhat we need is a population
p103
aVthat's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,
p104
aVbut doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,
p105
aVany of the things that might mess us up \u2014
p106
aVno human technology, human culture,
p107
aVmaybe even not human language.
p108
aVAnd so this is why we turned to these guys here.
p109
aVThese are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
p110
aVThese guys are New World primates,
p111
aVwhich means they broke off from the human branch
p112
aVabout 35 million years ago.
p113
aVThis means that your great, great, great great, great, great \u2014
p114
aVwith about five million "greats" in there \u2014
p115
aVgrandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great
p116
aVgrandmother with five million "greats" in there
p117
aVas Holly up here.
p118
aVYou know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,
p119
aVbut albeit evolutionary, relative.
p120
aVThe good news about Holly though is that
p121
aVshe doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
p122
aVYou know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,
p123
aVbut she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
p124
aVSo she's the perfect test case.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhat if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
p127
aVDoes she make the same mistakes as us?
p128
aVDoes she not learn from them? And so on.
p129
aVAnd so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
p130
aVMy students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
p131
aVWe said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,
p132
aVsee if she messes these things up.
p133
aVFirst problem is just, well, where should we start?
p134
aVBecause, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
p135
aVWe make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
p136
aVYou know, where are we actually going to start with this?
p137
aVAnd because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,
p138
aVaround the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,
p139
aVwe said, hhmm, maybe we should
p140
aVactually start in the financial domain.
p141
aVMaybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions
p142
aVand try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
p143
aa(lp144
VOf course, that's when we hit a sort second problem \u2014
p145
aVa little bit more methodological \u2014
p146
aVwhich is that, maybe you guys don't know,
p147
aVbut monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
p148
aVBut this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you
p149
aVat the grocery store or the ATM \u2014 you know, they don't do this stuff.
p150
aVSo now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
p151
aVHow are we actually going to ask monkeys about money
p152
aVif they don't actually use it?
p153
aVSo we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up
p154
aVand teach monkeys how to use money.
p155
aVSo that's just what we did.
p156
aVWhat you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of
p157
aVof non-human currency.
p158
aVWe weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,
p159
aVso we just called it a token.
p160
aVBut this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale
p161
aVto actually use with humans,
p162
aVto actually buy different pieces of food.
p163
aVIt doesn't look like much \u2014 in fact, it isn't like much.
p164
aa(lp165
VLike most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
p166
aVAs those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,
p167
aVonce you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
p168
aVIt was useless to the monkeys at first
p169
aVbefore they realized what they could do with it.
p170
aVWhen we first gave it to them in their enclosures,
p171
aVthey actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
p172
aVThey were these kind of weird things.
p173
aVBut very quickly, the monkeys realized
p174
aVthat they could actually hand these tokens over
p175
aVto different humans in the lab for some food.
p176
aVAnd so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
p177
aVThis is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit
p178
aVcurious about these things \u2014 doesn't know.
p179
aVThere's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,
p180
aVand Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
p181
aVHands it over, and then gets some food.
p182
aVIt turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good
p183
aVat trading tokens with human salesman.
p184
aVSo here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
p185
aVHere's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food
p186
aVand waiting happily and getting her food.
p187
aVHere's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
p188
aVBut he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo the monkeys get really good at this.
p191
aVThey're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
p192
aVWe just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
p193
aVThe question is: is this anything like human money?
p194
aVIs this a market at all,
p195
aVor did we just do a weird psychologist's trick
p196
aVby getting monkeys to do something,
p197
aVlooking smart, but not really being smart.
p198
aVAnd so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do
p199
aVif this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
p200
aVWell, you might actually imagine them
p201
aVto do all the kinds of smart things
p202
aVthat humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
p203
aVYou might have them start paying attention to price,
p204
aVpaying attention to how much they buy \u2014
p205
aVsort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
p206
aVDo the monkeys do anything like this?
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd so our monkey marketplace was born.
p209
aVThe way this works is that
p210
aVour monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
p211
aVWhen they get a hankering for some treats,
p212
aVwe actually allowed them a way out
p213
aVinto a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
p214
aVUpon entering the market \u2014
p215
aVit was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets
p216
aVbecause, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,
p217
aVa human would give them a big wallet full of tokens
p218
aVso they could actually trade the tokens
p219
aVwith one of these two guys here \u2014
p220
aVtwo different possible human salesmen
p221
aVthat they could actually buy stuff from.
p222
aVThe salesmen were students from my lab.
p223
aVThey dressed differently; they were different people.
p224
aVAnd over time, they did basically the same thing
p225
aVso the monkeys could learn, you know,
p226
aVwho sold what at what price \u2014 you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
p227
aVAnd you can see that each of the experimenters
p228
aVis actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
p229
aVand that's what the monkey can for a single token.
p230
aVSo everything costs one token,
p231
aVbut as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,
p232
aVsometimes more grapes than others.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
p235
aVHere's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
p236
aVBut here's Honey.
p237
aVShe's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
p238
aVAll of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
p239
aVYou can see Honey, very good market economist,
p240
aVgoes with the guy who gives more.
p241
aVShe could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
p242
aVSo not just Honey,
p243
aVmost of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
p244
aVMost of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
p245
aVWhen we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
p246
aVThey really cared about their monkey token dollar.
p247
aVThe more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists
p248
aVto actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,
p249
aVthey basically matched, not just qualitatively,
p250
aVbut quantitatively with what we saw
p251
aVhumans doing in a real market.
p252
aVSo much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,
p253
aVyou couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd what we'd really thought we'd done
p256
aVis like we'd actually introduced something
p257
aVthat, at least for the monkeys and us,
p258
aVworks like a real financial currency.
p259
aVQuestion is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
p260
aVWell, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
p261
aVOne thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace
p262
aVwas any evidence of saving \u2014
p263
aVyou know, just like our own species.
p264
aVThe monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget
p265
aVand then went back to everyone else.
p266
aVThe other thing we also spontaneously saw,
p267
aVembarrassingly enough,
p268
aVis spontaneous evidence of larceny.
p269
aVThe monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity \u2014
p270
aVfrom each other, often from us \u2014
p271
aVyou know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,
p272
aVbut things we spontaneously saw.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo we said, this looks bad.
p275
aVCan we actually see if the monkeys
p276
aVare doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
p277
aVOne possibility is just kind of let
p278
aVthe monkey financial system play out,
p279
aVyou know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
p280
aVWe were a little impatient so we wanted
p281
aVto sort of speed things up a bit.
p282
aVSo we said, let's actually give the monkeys
p283
aVthe same kinds of problems
p284
aVthat humans tend to get wrong
p285
aVin certain kinds of economic challenges,
p286
aVor certain kinds of economic experiments.
p287
aVAnd so, since the best way to see how people go wrong
p288
aVis to actually do it yourself,
p289
aVI'm going to give you guys a quick experiment
p290
aVto sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo imagine that right now
p293
aVI handed each and every one of you
p294
aVa thousand U.S. dollars \u2014 so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
p295
aVTake these, put it in your wallet
p296
aVand spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
p297
aVBecause it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
p298
aVDonate it, take it, and so on.
p299
aVSounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
p300
aVAnd here's your choice: you can either be risky,
p301
aVin which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
p302
aVIf it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
p303
aVIf it comes up tails, you get nothing.
p304
aVSo it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
p305
aVYour other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
p306
aVI'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
p307
aVYou can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
p308
aVSo see what your intuition is here.
p309
aVMost people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
p310
aVMost people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
p311
aVThis seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
p312
aVYou might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
p313
aVPeople are a little risk-averse. So what?
p314
aa(lp315
VWell, the "so what?" comes when start thinking
p316
aVabout the same problem
p317
aVset up just a little bit differently.
p318
aVSo now imagine that I give each and every one of you
p319
aV2,000 dollars \u2014 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
p320
aVNow you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
p321
aVThink about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
p322
aVAnd now imagine that I have you make another choice
p323
aVBut this time, it's a little bit worse.
p324
aVNow, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,
p325
aVbut you're going to get the same choice.
p326
aVYou can either take a risky loss \u2014
p327
aVso I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
p328
aVIf it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing \u2014
p329
aVor you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet
p330
aVand give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
p333
aVSo maybe you're having the same intuitions
p334
aVas the subjects that were actually tested in this,
p335
aVwhich is when presented with these options,
p336
aVpeople don't choose to play it safe.
p337
aVThey actually tend to go a little risky.
p338
aVThe reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations
p339
aVthe same choice.
p340
aVIt's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,
p341
aVor just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
p342
aVBut people's intuitions about how much risk to take
p343
aVvaries depending on where they started with.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo what's going on?
p346
aVWell, it turns out that this seems to be the result
p347
aVof at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
p348
aVOne is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
p349
aVYou really have to do work to figure out,
p350
aVwell, one option's a thousand, 2,000;
p351
aVone is 1,500.
p352
aVInstead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms
p353
aVas options change from one time to another.
p354
aVSo we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
p355
aVThis is all well and good, except that
p356
aVchanges in different directions
p357
aVactually effect whether or not we think
p358
aVoptions are good or not.
p359
aVAnd this leads to the second bias,
p360
aVwhich economists have called loss aversion.
p361
aa(lp362
VThe idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
p363
aVWe really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
p364
aVAnd this means that sometimes we'll actually
p365
aVswitch our preferences to avoid this.
p366
aVWhat you saw in that last scenario is that
p367
aVsubjects get risky
p368
aVbecause they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
p369
aVThat means when we're in a risk mindset \u2014
p370
aVexcuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,
p371
aVwe actually become more risky,
p372
aVwhich can actually be really worrying.
p373
aVThese kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
p374
aVThey're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer \u2014
p375
aVbecause they're evaluating them in relative terms.
p376
aVThey're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house \u2014
p377
aVbecause they don't want to sell at a loss.
p378
aa(lp379
VThe question we were interested in
p380
aVis whether the monkeys show the same biases.
p381
aVIf we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,
p382
aVwould they do the same thing as people?
p383
aVAnd so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices
p384
aVbetween guys who were safe \u2014 they did the same thing every time \u2014
p385
aVor guys who were risky \u2014
p386
aVthey did things differently half the time.
p387
aVAnd then we gave them options that were bonuses \u2014
p388
aVlike you guys did in the first scenario \u2014
p389
aVso they actually have a chance more,
p390
aVor pieces where they were experiencing losses \u2014
p391
aVthey actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd so this is what this looks like.
p394
aVWe introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
p395
aVThe guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,
p396
aVso it looks pretty good.
p397
aVBut they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
p398
aVThe guy on the left is a safe bonus.
p399
aVAll the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
p400
aVThe guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
p401
aVSometimes the monkeys get no bonus \u2014 so this is a bonus of zero.
p402
aVSometimes the monkeys get two extra.
p403
aVFor a big bonus, now they get three.
p404
aVBut this is the same choice you guys just faced.
p405
aVDo the monkeys actually want to play it safe
p406
aVand then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,
p407
aVor do they want to be risky
p408
aVand try to get a risky, but big, bonus,
p409
aVbut risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
p410
aVPeople here played it safe.
p411
aVTurns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
p412
aVQualitatively and quantitatively,
p413
aVthey choose exactly the same way as people,
p414
aVwhen tested in the same thing.
p415
aa(lp416
VYou might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
p417
aVMaybe we should see how they do with losses.
p418
aVAnd so we ran a second version of this.
p419
aVNow, the monkeys meet two guys
p420
aVwho aren't giving them bonuses;
p421
aVthey're actually giving them less than they expect.
p422
aVSo they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
p423
aVThese are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
p424
aVBut now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
p425
aVThey guy on the left is a safe loss.
p426
aVEvery single time, he's going to take one of these away
p427
aVand give the monkeys just two.
p428
aVthe guy on the right is the risky loss.
p429
aVSometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,
p430
aVbut sometimes he actually gives a big loss,
p431
aVtaking away two to give the monkeys only one.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd so what do the monkeys do?
p434
aVAgain, same choice; they can play it safe
p435
aVfor always getting two grapes every single time,
p436
aVor they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
p437
aVThe remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,
p438
aVthey do the same irrational thing that people do.
p439
aVThey actually become more risky
p440
aVdepending on how the experimenters started.
p441
aVThis is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too
p442
aVare evaluating things in relative terms
p443
aVand actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
p444
aa(lp445
VSo what does all of this mean?
p446
aVWell, what we've shown is that, first of all,
p447
aVwe can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,
p448
aVand they do very similar things with it.
p449
aVThey do some of the smart things we do,
p450
aVsome of the kind of not so nice things we do,
p451
aVlike steal it and so on.
p452
aVBut they also do some of the irrational things we do.
p453
aVThey systematically get things wrong
p454
aVand in the same ways that we do.
p455
aVThis is the first take-home message of the Talk,
p456
aVwhich is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,
p457
aVoh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
p458
aVThey're way cuter than the one at ... you know \u2014
p459
aVDon't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb
p460
aVas the human one you already have.
p461
aVSo, you know, a little bad \u2014 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
p462
aVA little bad for monkey investors.
p463
aa(lp464
VBut of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
p465
aVBecause we've answered the question we started out with.
p466
aVWe wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
p467
aVAnd we started with the hope that maybe we can
p468
aVsort of tweak our financial institutions,
p469
aVtweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
p470
aVBut what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
p471
aVIn fact, they might be due to the very nature
p472
aVof our evolutionary history.
p473
aVYou know, maybe it's not just humans
p474
aVat the right side of this chain that's duncey.
p475
aVMaybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
p476
aVAnd this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,
p477
aVmeans that these duncey strategies
p478
aVmight be 35 million years old.
p479
aVThat's a long time for a strategy
p480
aVto potentially get changed around \u2014 really, really old.
p481
aa(lp482
VWhat do we know about other old strategies like this?
p483
aVWell, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
p484
aVYou know, think of our evolutionary predilection
p485
aVfor eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
p486
aVYou can't just shut that off.
p487
aVYou can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
p488
aVWe're just built differently.
p489
aVWe're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
p490
aVMy guess is that the same thing is going to be true
p491
aVwhen humans are perceiving
p492
aVdifferent financial decisions.
p493
aVWhen you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,
p494
aVwhen you're watching your house price go down,
p495
aVyou're not going to be able to see that
p496
aVin anything but old evolutionary terms.
p497
aVThis means that the biases
p498
aVthat lead investors to do badly,
p499
aVthat lead to the foreclosure crisis
p500
aVare going to be really hard to overcome.
p501
aa(lp502
VSo that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
p503
aVI'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
p504
aVWell, the good news, I think,
p505
aVis what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,
p506
aVwhich is that humans are not only smart;
p507
aVwe're really inspirationally smart
p508
aVto the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
p509
aVWe're so good at overcoming our biological limitations \u2014
p510
aVyou know, I flew over here in an airplane.
p511
aVI didn't have to try to flap my wings.
p512
aVI'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
p513
aVI don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
p514
aVWe actually have all of these cases
p515
aVwhere we overcome our biological limitations
p516
aVthrough technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
p517
aVBut we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
p518
aa(lp519
VAnd here's the rub.
p520
aVIt was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species
p521
aVwho refuses to be what he really is."
p522
aVBut the irony is that
p523
aVit might only be in recognizing our limitations
p524
aVthat we can really actually overcome them.
p525
aVThe hope is that you all will think about your limitations,
p526
aVnot necessarily as unovercomable,
p527
aVbut to recognize them, accept them
p528
aVand then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
p529
aVThat might be the only way that we will really be able
p530
aVto achieve our own human potential
p531
aVand really be the noble species we hope to all be.
p532

VThank you.
