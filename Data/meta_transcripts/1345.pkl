VI'm going to talk to you today
p4
aVabout the design of medical technology for low-resource settings.
p5
aVI study health systems in these countries.
p6
aVAnd one of the major gaps in care,
p7
aValmost across the board,
p8
aVis access to safe surgery.
p9
aVNow one of the major bottlenecks that we've found
p10
aVthat's sort of preventing both the access in the first place,
p11
aVand the safety of those surgeries that do happen, is anesthesia.
p12
aVAnd actually, it's the model that we expect to work
p13
aVfor delivering anesthesia in these environments.
p14
aa(lp15
VHere, we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the US,
p16
aVor any other developed country.
p17
aVIn the background there
p18
aVis a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.
p19
aVAnd this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives
p20
aVbecause it was designed with this environment in mind.
p21
aVIn order to operate, this machine needs a number of things
p22
aVthat this hospital has to offer.
p23
aVIt needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist
p24
aVwith years of training with complex machines
p25
aVto help her monitor the flows of the gas
p26
aVand keep her patients safe and anesthetized
p27
aVthroughout the surgery.
p28
aVIt's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms,
p29
aVand it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running,
p30
aVand it's going to break pretty easily.
p31
aVAnd when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers
p32
aVwho understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts
p33
aVand keep it saving lives.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's a pretty expensive machine.
p36
aVIt needs a hospital whose budget can allow it
p37
aVto support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.
p38
aVAnd perhaps most obviously,
p39
aVbut also most importantly \u2014
p40
aVand the path to concepts that we've heard about
p41
aVkind of illustrates this \u2014
p42
aVit needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity,
p43
aVof compressed oxygen, and other medical supplies
p44
aVthat are so critical to the functioning of this machine.
p45
aVIn other words, this machine requires a lot of stuff
p46
aVthat this hospital cannot offer.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi.
p49
aVIn this hospital,
p50
aVthere is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia,
p51
aVand she's qualified
p52
aVbecause she has 12, maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia.
p53
aVIn the hospital and in the entire region
p54
aVthere's not a single biomedical engineer.
p55
aVSo when this machine breaks,
p56
aVthe machines that they have to work with break,
p57
aVthey've got to try and figure it out,
p58
aVbut most of the time, that's the end of the road.
p59
aVThose machines go the proverbial junkyard.
p60
aVAnd the price tag of the machine that I mentioned
p61
aVcould represent maybe a quarter or a third
p62
aVof the annual operating budget for this hospital.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong.
p65
aVThis hospital is connected to a very weak power grid,
p66
aVone that goes down frequently.
p67
aVSo it runs frequently, the entire hospital,
p68
aVjust on a generator.
p69
aVAnd you can imagine, the generator breaks down
p70
aVor runs out of fuel.
p71
aVAnd the World Bank sees this
p72
aVand estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country
p73
aVcan expect up to 18 power outages per month.
p74
aVSimilarly, compressed oxygen and other medical supplies
p75
aVare really a luxury,
p76
aVand can often be out of stock for months or even a year.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now
p79
aVis taking those machines that were designed
p80
aVfor that first environment that I showed you
p81
aVand donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment.
p82
aVIt's not just inappropriate,
p83
aVit becomes really unsafe.
p84
aa(lp85
VOne of our partners at Johns Hopkins
p86
aVwas observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago.
p87
aVAnd the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case.
p88
aVA woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section
p89
aVto save her life and the life of her baby.
p90
aVAnd everything began pretty auspiciously.
p91
aVThe surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.
p92
aVThe nurse was there.
p93
aVShe was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important
p94
aVbecause of the emergency nature of the situation.
p95
aVAnd everything began well
p96
aVuntil the power went out.
p97
aVAnd now in the middle of this surgery,
p98
aVthe surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case,
p99
aVwhich he can do \u2014 he's got a headlamp.
p100
aVBut the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater
p101
aVtrying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient,
p102
aVto keep her patient asleep.
p103
aVBecause her machine doesn't work when there's no power.
p104
aVThis routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced,
p105
aVand others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy.
p106
aVAnd what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event;
p107
aVthis happens across the developing world.
p108
aV35 million surgeries are attempted every year
p109
aVwithout safe anesthesia.
p110
aa(lp111
VMy colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton, was living this reality.
p112
aVHe was the chief of anesthesiology
p113
aVin a hospital in Malawi, a teaching hospital.
p114
aVHe went to work every day
p115
aVin an operating theater like this one,
p116
aVtrying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so
p117
aVusing that same equipment
p118
aVthat became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.
p119
aVAnd after umpteen surgeries
p120
aVand, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy,
p121
aVhe just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough.
p122
aVThere has to be something better."
p123
aVHe took a walk down the hall
p124
aVto where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them,
p125
aVI think that's the scientific term,
p126
aVand he started tinkering.
p127
aVHe took one part from here and another from there,
p128
aVand he tried to come up with a machine that would work
p129
aVin the reality that he was facing.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd what he came up with:
p132
aVwas this guy.
p133
aVThe prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine \u2014
p134
aVa machine that would work and anesthetize his patients
p135
aVno matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer.
p136
aVHere it is, back at home
p137
aVat that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later,
p138
aVworking on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.
p139
aa(lp140
VLet me show you a little bit about how this machine works.
p141
aVVoila!
p142
aVHere she is.
p143
aVWhen you have electricity,
p144
aVeverything in this machine begins in the base.
p145
aVThere's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there.
p146
aVNow you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point.
p147
aVEssentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible,
p148
aVbecause eventually you're going to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.
p149
aVAnd the mixture that the patient inhales
p150
aVneeds to be at least a certain percentage oxygen
p151
aVor else it can become dangerous.
p152
aVBut so in here when there's electricity,
p153
aVthe oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
p154
aVNow we know room air is gloriously free,
p155
aVit is abundant,
p156
aVand it's already 21 percent oxygen.
p157
aVSo all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it
p158
aVand send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here,
p159
aVwhere it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow before that mixture hits the patient's lungs,
p162
aVit's going to pass by here \u2014 you can't see it,
p163
aVbut there's an oxygen sensor here \u2014
p164
aVthat's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
p165
aVNow if you don't have power,
p166
aVor, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of a surgery,
p167
aVthis machine transitions automatically,
p168
aVwithout even having to touch it,
p169
aVto drawing in room air from this inlet.
p170
aa(lp171
VEverything else is the same.
p172
aVThe only difference is that now
p173
aVyou're only working with 21 percent oxygen.
p174
aVNow that used to be a dangerous guessing game,
p175
aVbecause you only knew if you gave too little oxygen
p176
aVonce something bad happened.
p177
aVBut we've put a long-life battery backup on here.
p178
aVThis is the only part that's battery backed up.
p179
aVBut this gives control to the provider, whether there's power or not,
p180
aVbecause they can adjust the flows
p181
aVbased on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving the patient.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn both cases, whether you have power or not,
p184
aVsometimes the patient needs help breathing.
p185
aVIt's just a reality of anesthesia, the lungs can be paralyzed.
p186
aVAnd so we've just added this manual bellows.
p187
aVWe've seen surgeries for three or four hours
p188
aVto ventilate the patient on this.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo it's a straightforward machine.
p191
aVI shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.
p192
aVAnd it's by design.
p193
aVYou do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist
p194
aVto use this machine,
p195
aVwhich is good because, in these rural district hospitals,
p196
aVyou're not going to get that level of training.
p197
aVIt's also designed for the environment that it will be used in.
p198
aa(lp199
VThis is an incredibly rugged machine.
p200
aVIt has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear
p201
aVthat happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
p202
aVAnd so it's not going to break very easily,
p203
aVbut if it does, virtually every piece in this machine
p204
aVcan be swapped out and replaced
p205
aVwith a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
p206
aVAnd finally, it's affordable.
p207
aVThis machine comes in at an eighth of the cost
p208
aVof the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
p209
aVSo in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery
p210
aVand save lives,
p211
aVbecause it was designed for its environment,
p212
aVjust like the first machine I showed you.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut we're not content to stop there.
p215
aVIs it working?
p216
aVIs this the design that's going to work in place?
p217
aVWell, we've seen good results so far.
p218
aVThis is in 13 hospitals in four countries,
p219
aVand since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries
p220
aVwith no clinically adverse events.
p221
aVSo we're thrilled.
p222
aVThis really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution
p223
aVto a problem that's really pervasive.
p224
aVBut we still want to be sure
p225
aVthat this is the most effective and safe device
p226
aVthat we can be putting into hospitals.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo to do that, we've launched a number of partnerships
p229
aVwith NGOs and universities,
p230
aVto gather data on the user interface,
p231
aVon the types of surgeries it's appropriate for,
p232
aVand ways we can enhance the device itself.
p233
aVOne of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins
p234
aVjust here in Baltimore.
p235
aVThey have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
p236
aVSo we're taking this machine
p237
aVand recreating some of the operating theater crises
p238
aVthat this machine might face
p239
aVin one of the hospitals that it's intended for,
p240
aVand in a contained, safe environment,
p241
aVevaluating its effectiveness.
p242
aVWe're then able to compare the results from that study
p243
aVwith real-world experience,
p244
aVbecause we're putting two of these in hospitals
p245
aVthat Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone,
p246
aVincluding the hospital where that emergency C-section happened.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.
p249
aVI think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
p250
aVAnd it really seems peripheral, we never think about it,
p251
aVuntil we don't have access to it,
p252
aVand then it becomes a gatekeeper.
p253
aVWho gets surgery and who doesn't?
p254
aVWho gets safe surgery and who doesn't?
p255
aVBut you know, it's just one of so many ways
p256
aVthat design, appropriate design,
p257
aVcan have an impact on health outcomes.
p258
aVIf more people in the health-delivery space
p259
aVreally working on some of these challenges in low-income countries
p260
aVcould start their design process, their solution search,
p261
aVfrom outside of that proverbial box
p262
aVand inside of the hospital \u2014
p263
aVIn other words, if we could design
p264
aVfor the environment that exists in so many parts of the world,
p265
aVrather than the one that we wished existed \u2014
p266
aVwe might just save a lot of lives.
p267
