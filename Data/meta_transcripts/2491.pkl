VI am holding something remarkably old.
p4
aVIt is older than any human artifact,
p5
aVolder than life on Earth,
p6
aVolder than the continents and the oceans between them.
p7
aVThis was formed over four billion years ago
p8
aVin the earliest days of the solar system
p9
aVwhile the planets were still forming.
p10
aVThis rusty lump of nickel and iron may not appear special,
p11
aVbut when it is cut open ...
p12
aVyou can see that it is different from earthly metals.
p13
aVThis pattern reveals metallic crystals that can only form out in space
p14
aVwhere molten metal can cool extremely slowly,
p15
aVa few degrees every million years.
p16
aVThis was once part of a much larger object,
p17
aVone of millions left over after the planets formed.
p18
aVWe call these objects asteroids.
p19
aa(lp20
VAsteroids are our oldest and most numerous cosmic neighbors.
p21
aVThis graphic shows near-Earth asteroids orbiting around the Sun,
p22
aVshown in yellow,
p23
aVand swinging close to the Earth's orbit,
p24
aVshown in blue.
p25
aVThe sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids have been greatly exaggerated
p26
aVso you can see them clearly.
p27
aVTeams of scientists across the globe are searching for these objects,
p28
aVdiscovering new ones every day,
p29
aVsteadily mapping near-Earth space.
p30
aVMuch of this work is funded by NASA.
p31
aVI think of the search for these asteroids as a giant public works project,
p32
aVbut instead of building a highway, we're charting outer space,
p33
aVbuilding an archive that will last for generations.
p34
aa(lp35
VThese are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids discovered just last year.
p36
aVAnd these are all of the known near-Earth asteroids,
p37
aVwhich at last count was 13,733.
p38
aVEach one has been imaged, cataloged
p39
aVand had its path around the Sun determined.
p40
aVAlthough it varies from asteroid to asteroid,
p41
aVthe paths of most asteroids can be predicted for dozens of years.
p42
aVAnd the paths of some asteroids can be predicted with incredible precision.
p43
aVFor example, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
p44
aVpredicted where the asteroid Toutatis was going to be four years in advance
p45
aVto within 30 kilometers.
p46
aVIn those four years,
p47
aVToutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.
p48
aVThat's a fractional precision
p49
aVof 0.000000004.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, the reason I have this beautiful asteroid fragment
p54
aVis because, like all neighbors,
p55
aVasteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VThree years ago today,
p60
aVa small asteroid exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.
p61
aVThat object was about 19 meters across,
p62
aVor about as big as a convenience store.
p63
aVObjects of this size hit the Earth every 50 years or so.
p64
aa(lp65
V66 million years ago,
p66
aVa much larger object hit the Earth,
p67
aVcausing a massive extinction.
p68
aV75 percent of plant and animal species were lost,
p69
aVincluding, sadly, the dinosaurs.
p70
aVThat object was about 10 kilometers across,
p71
aVand 10 kilometers is roughly the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.
p72
aVSo the next time you're in an airplane,
p73
aVsnag a window seat, look out and imagine a rock so enormous
p74
aVthat resting on the ground,
p75
aVit just grazes your wingtip.
p76
aVIt's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it.
p77
aVThat's the size of the asteroid that hit the Earth.
p78
aa(lp79
VIt has only been within my lifetime
p80
aVthat asteroids have been considered a credible threat to our planet.
p81
aVAnd since then, there's been a focused effort underway
p82
aVto discover and catalog these objects.
p83
aVI am lucky enough to be part of this effort.
p84
aVI'm part of a team of scientists that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.
p85
aVNow, NEOWISE was not designed to find asteroids.
p86
aVIt was designed to orbit the earth and look far beyond our solar system
p87
aVto seek out the coldest stars and the most luminous galaxies.
p88
aVAnd it did that very well for its designed lifetime of seven months.
p89
aVBut today, six years later, it's still going.
p90
aVWe've repurposed it to discover and study asteroids.
p91
aVAnd although it's a wonderful little space robot,
p92
aVthese days it's kind of like a used car.
p93
aVThe cryogen that used to refrigerate its sensors is long gone,
p94
aVso we joke that its air-conditioning is broken.
p95
aVIt's got 920 million miles on the odometer,
p96
aVbut it still runs great
p97
aVand reliably takes a photograph of the sky every 11 seconds.
p98
aVIt's taken 23 photos since I began speaking to you.
p99
aa(lp100
VOne of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable
p101
aVis that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared.
p102
aVThat means that instead of seeing the sunlight that asteroids reflect,
p103
aVNEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.
p104
aVThis is a vital capability since some asteroids are as dark as coal
p105
aVand can be difficult or impossible to spot with other telescopes.
p106
aVBut all asteroids, light or dark, shine brightly for NEOWISE.
p107
aa(lp108
VAstronomers are using every technique at their disposal
p109
aVto discover and study asteroids.
p110
aVIn 2010, a historic milestone was reached.
p111
aVThe community, together, discovered over 90 percent of asteroids
p112
aVbigger than one kilometer across \u2014
p113
aVobjects capable of massive destruction to Earth.
p114
aVBut the job's not done yet.
p115
aVAn object 140 meters or bigger could decimate a medium-sized country.
p116
aVSo far, we've only found 25 percent of those.
p117
aa(lp118
VWe must keep searching the sky for near-Earth asteroids.
p119
aVWe are the only species able to understand calculus
p120
aVor build telescopes.
p121
aVWe know how to find these objects.
p122
aVThis is our responsibility.
p123
aVIf we found a hazardous asteroid with significant early warning,
p124
aVwe could nudge it out of the way.
p125
aVUnlike earthquakes, hurricanes or volcanic eruptions,
p126
aVan asteroid impact can be precisely predicted
p127
aVand prevented.
p128
aVWhat we need to do now is map near-Earth space.
p129
aVWe must keep searching the sky.
p130
