VThe theme of my talk today is,
p4
aV"Be an artist, right now."
p5
aVMost people, when this subject is brought up,
p6
aVget tense and resist it:
p7
aV"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.
p8
aVI have to go to school, get a job,
p9
aVsend my kids to lessons ... "
p10
aVYou think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."
p11
aVThere are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
p12
aVDon't they just pop into your head?
p13
aa(lp14
VThere are so many reasons why we can't be,
p15
aVindeed, we're not sure why we should be.
p16
aVWe don't know why we should be artists,
p17
aVbut we have many reasons why we can't be.
p18
aVWhy do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
p19
aVPerhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted
p20
aVor for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
p21
aVAnd some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
p22
aVWell you might have, but I don't think so.
p23
aVThis is the theme of my talk today.
p24
aVWe are all born artists.
p25
aa(lp26
VIf you have kids, you know what I mean.
p27
aVAlmost everything kids do is art.
p28
aVThey draw with crayons on the wall.
p29
aVThey dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,
p30
aVbut you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance \u2014 it becomes the kids' own dance.
p31
aVSo they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
p32
aVPerhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,
p33
aVand because they practice such art all day long,
p34
aVpeople honestly get a little tired around kids.
p35
aa(lp36
VKids will sometimes perform monodramas \u2014
p37
aVplaying house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
p38
aVAnd some kids, when they get a bit older,
p39
aVstart to lie.
p40
aVUsually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
p41
aVThey're shocked.
p42
aV"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"
p43
aVShe questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"
p44
aa(lp45
VBut you shouldn't worry.
p46
aVThe moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
p47
aVThey are talking about things they didn't see.
p48
aVIt's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.
p49
aVParents should celebrate.
p50
aV"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"
p51
aVAll right! It calls for celebration.
p52
aVFor example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."
p53
aVThen a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
p54
aVNow, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:
p55
aV"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
p56
aVWhere did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."
p57
aa(lp58
VWhen you have a conversation like this,
p59
aVthe kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
p60
aVSoon, a story develops.
p61
aVOf course this is an infantile story,
p62
aVbut thinking up one sentence after the next
p63
aVis the same thing a professional writer like me does.
p64
aVIn essence, they are not different.
p65
aVRoland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,
p66
aV"Flaubert did not write a novel.
p67
aVHe merely connected one sentence after another.
p68
aVThe eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."
p69
aVThat's right \u2014 a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,
p70
aVthen, without violating the scope of the first one,
p71
aVwriting the next sentence.
p72
aVAnd you continue to make connections.
p73
aa(lp74
VTake a look at this sentence:
p75
aV"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."
p76
aVYes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
p77
aVWriting such an unjustifiable sentence
p78
aVand continuing in order to justify it,
p79
aVKafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
p80
aVKafka did not show his work to his father.
p81
aVHe was not on good terms with his father.
p82
aVOn his own, he wrote these sentences.
p83
aVHad he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd that's right. Art is about going a little nuts
p86
aVand justifying the next sentence,
p87
aVwhich is not much different from what a kid does.
p88
aVA kid who has just started to lie
p89
aVis taking the first step as a storyteller.
p90
aVKids do art.
p91
aVThey don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
p92
aVI was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
p93
aVWhen kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
p94
aVBut some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,
p95
aVmaking mountains and seas \u2014 well, not seas,
p96
aVbut different things \u2014 people and dogs, etc.
p97
aVBut parents tell them,
p98
aV"It will all be washed away by the waves."
p99
aVIn other words, it's useless.
p100
aVThere's no need.
p101
aVBut kids don't mind.
p102
aVThey have fun in the moment
p103
aVand they keep playing in the sand.
p104
aVKids don't do it because someone told them to.
p105
aVThey aren't told by their boss
p106
aVor anyone, they just do it.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhen you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
p109
aVWhen I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,
p110
aVmany write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
p111
aVLearning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,
p112
aVor performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots \u2014 things like that.
p113
aVOr the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
p114
aVThey talk about these kinds of experiences.
p115
aVYou must have had such a moment.
p116
aVIn that moment, art makes you happy
p117
aVbecause it's not work.
p118
aVWork doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
p119
aa(lp120
VThe French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
p121
aVIt's a bit mischievous, actually.
p122
aV"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
p123
aVRight? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
p124
aVPlaying doesn't tire us.
p125
aVWe can play all night long.
p126
aVIf we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
p127
aVWhy? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
p128
aVBut kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.
p129
aVThey don't draw to sell the work to a client
p130
aVor play the piano to earn money for the family.
p131
aVOf course, there were kids who had to.
p132
aVYou know this gentleman, right?
p133
aVHe had to tour around Europe to support his family \u2014
p134
aVWolfgang Amadeus Mozart \u2014
p135
aVbut that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
p136
aVUnfortunately, at some point our art \u2014 such a joyful pastime \u2014 ends.
p137
aVKids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework
p138
aVand of course they take piano or ballet lessons,
p139
aVbut they aren't fun anymore.
p140
aVYou're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?
p141
aVIf you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,
p142
aVyou'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
p143
aVBesides,
p144
aVif you continue to act like an artist as you get older,
p145
aVyou'll increasingly feel pressure \u2014
p146
aVpeople will question your actions and ask you to act properly.
p147
aa(lp148
VHere's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
p149
aVI was trying my best, and my teacher came around
p150
aVand asked me, "What are you doing?"
p151
aV"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
p152
aV"Why are you using only black?"
p153
aVIndeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
p154
aVAnd I explained,
p155
aV"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
p156
aVThen my teacher said,
p157
aV"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
p158
aVOr so I wished.
p159
aV"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)
p160
aV"You'll get it!" he said.
p161
aVYou were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,
p162
aVbut I was coloring everything in black,
p163
aVso he dragged me out of the group.
p164
aVThere were a lot of girls there as well,
p165
aVso I was utterly mortified.
p166
aa(lp167
VNone of my explanations or excuses were heard,
p168
aVand I really got it big time.
p169
aVIf he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,
p170
aV"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,
p171
aVbut he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.
p172
aVBut such a teacher is seldom found.
p173
aVLater, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries \u2014
p174
aVI was a university student \u2014 and I thought this was really unfair.
p175
aVLook what I found. (Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VWorks like this were hung in Basel while I was punished
p178
aVand stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
p179
aVLook at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?
p180
aVContemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
p181
aVNo crows are brought up.
p182
aVMost of the works have no title, Untitled.
p183
aVAnyways, contemporary art in the 20th century
p184
aVis about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation \u2014
p185
aVessentially the same as I did.
p186
aVOf course, my work was very amateur,
p187
aVbut let's turn to more famous examples.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is Picasso's.
p190
aVHe stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?
p191
aVNext, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
p192
aVThat was Duchamp.
p193
aVSo filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories \u2014
p194
aVthat's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
p195
aVPicasso even made the statement,
p196
aV"I draw not what I see but what I think."
p197
aVYes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
p198
aVI wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
p199
aVUnfortunately, the little artists within us
p200
aVare choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
p201
aVThey get locked in.
p202
aVThat's our tragedy.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
p205
aVOur artistic desire doesn't go away.
p206
aVWe want to express, to reveal ourselves,
p207
aVbut with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
p208
aVIn karaoke bars, there are always people who sing
p209
aV"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"
p210
aVmiming the guitar riffs.
p211
aVUsually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
p212
aVSome people turn into rockers like this.
p213
aVOr some people dance in clubs.
p214
aVPeople who would have enjoyed telling stories
p215
aVend up trolling on the Internet all night long.
p216
aVThat's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
p217
aa(lp218
VSometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids
p219
aVplaying with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
p220
aVThey go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."
p221
aVThe kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,
p222
aVbut the dad alone builds castles.
p223
aVThis shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
p224
aVBut they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
p225
aVYou know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?
p226
aVTV is full of people who do what we wished to do,
p227
aVbut never got to.
p228
aVThey dance, they act \u2014 and the more they do, they are praised.
p229
aVSo we start to envy them.
p230
aVWe become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
p231
aV"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."
p232
aVWe easily say these sorts of things.
p233
aVWe get jealous, not because we're evil,
p234
aVbut because we have little artists pent up inside us.
p235
aVThat's what I think.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhat should we do then?
p238
aVYes, that's right.
p239
aVRight now, we need to start our own art.
p240
aVRight this minute, we can turn off TV,
p241
aVlog off the Internet,
p242
aVget up and start to do something.
p243
aVWhere I teach students in drama school,
p244
aVthere's a course called Dramatics.
p245
aVIn this course, all students must put on a play.
p246
aVHowever, acting majors are not supposed to act.
p247
aVThey can write the play, for example,
p248
aVand the writers may work on stage art.
p249
aVLikewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
p250
aVStudents at first wonder whether they can actually do it,
p251
aVbut later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
p252
aVIn school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
p253
aVI saw this happen in the army \u2014 many people had fun doing plays.
p254
aa(lp255
VI have another experience:
p256
aVIn my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
p257
aVI have students like you in the class \u2014 many who don't major in writing.
p258
aVSome major in art or music and think they can't write.
p259
aVSo I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
p260
aVIt can be a simple theme:
p261
aVWrite about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
p262
aVThere's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
p263
aVI walk around and encourage them,
p264
aV"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
p265
aVThey only get to think for the first five minutes.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe reason I make them write like crazy is because
p268
aVwhen you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,
p269
aVthe artistic devil creeps in.
p270
aVThis devil will tell you hundreds of reasons
p271
aVwhy you can't write:
p272
aV"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!
p273
aVWhat kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"
p274
aVIt will say a lot of things.
p275
aVYou have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
p276
aVThe really good writing I've seen in my class
p277
aVwas not from the assignments with a long deadline,
p278
aVbut from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did
p279
aVin front of me with a pencil.
p280
aVThe students go into a kind of trance.
p281
aVAfter 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
p282
aVAnd in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo I can say this:
p285
aVIt's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,
p286
aVbut rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
p287
aVWhy we cannot be something is not important.
p288
aVMost artists became artists because of the one reason.
p289
aVWhen we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,
p290
aVenemies appear on the outside.
p291
aVMostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)
p292
aVSometimes they look like our spouses,
p293
aVbut they are not your parents or spouses.
p294
aVThey are devils. Devils.
p295
aVThey came to Earth briefly transformed
p296
aVto stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
p297
aVAnd they have a magic question.
p298
aVWhen we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or
p299
aV"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"
p300
aVThe magic question is, "What for?"
p301
aVBut art is not for anything.
p302
aVArt is the ultimate goal.
p303
aVIt saves our souls and makes us live happily.
p304
aVIt helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
p305
aVSo in response to such a pragmatic question,
p306
aVwe need to be bold.
p307
aV"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"
p308
aVis what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."
p309
aVThe ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,
p310
aVat least one of which is an artist.
p311
aa(lp312
VOnce I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,
p313
aVand in front of me I saw something related to a play.
p314
aVSo I asked the driver, "What is this?"
p315
aVHe said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.
p316
aVHe was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"
p317
aVHe proudly said he played King Lear.
p318
aVKing Lear.
p319
aV"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" \u2014 a great line from King Lear.
p320
aVThat's the world I dream of.
p321
aVSomeone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
p322
aVOr a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,
p323
aVsecretly or publicly performing their own arts.
p324
aa(lp325
VIn 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
p326
aVThe great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport
p327
aVand a reporter asked her a typical question:
p328
aV"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
p329
aVAny advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"
p330
aVNow, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
p331
aVIn 1990, she was asked this question.
p332
aVAnd here's what she answered:
p333
aV"Just do it."
p334
aVWow. I was touched.
p335
aVOnly those three words and she left the airport. That's it.
p336
aVSo what should we do now?
p337
aVLet's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
p338
aVJust do it!
p339
aa(lp340
VThank you.
p341
