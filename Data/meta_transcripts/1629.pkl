VHello, Doha. Hello!
p4
aVSalaam alaikum.
p5
aa(lp6
VI love coming to Doha. It's such an international place.
p7
aVIt feels like the United Nations here.
p8
aVYou land at the airport, and you're welcomed by an Indian lady
p9
aVwho takes you to Al Maha Services, where you meet a Filipino lady
p10
aVwho hands you off to a South African lady
p11
aVwho then takes you to a Korean
p12
aVwho takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage
p13
aVwho takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan.
p14
aVYou go to the hotel and you check in. There's a Lebanese.
p15
aVYeah? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room.
p16
aa(lp17
VI said, "Where are the Qataris?"
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
V(Applause)
p22
aa(lp23
VThey said, "No, no, it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart."
p24
aV"They know."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.
p29
aVYou know, like sometimes you run into people
p30
aVthat you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well.
p31
aVMy Indian cab driver showed up at the W,
p32
aVand I asked him to take me to the Sheraton,
p33
aVand he said, "No problem, sir."
p34
aVAnd then we sat there for two minutes.
p35
aa(lp36
VI said, "What's wrong?" He said, "One problem, sir."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VI said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VI go, "You're the driver, you should know."
p45
aa(lp46
VHe goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."
p47
aa(lp48
VI go, "You just arrived at the W?" "No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
V"I was on my way home from the airport,
p53
aVI got a job. I'm working already."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VHe goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?"
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V"I don't know where we're going."
p62
aa(lp63
V"Neither do I. It will be an adventure, sir."
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VThe Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years.
p68
aVIt is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this.
p69
aVAre there any Lebanese here tonight, by applause?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Cheering)
p72
aa(lp73
VLebanese, yeah.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe Middle East is going crazy.
p76
aVYou know the Middle East is going crazy
p77
aVwhen Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p80
aa(lp81
VWho would have thought?
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VOh my gosh.
p86
aa(lp87
VNo, there's serious issues in the region.
p88
aVSome people don't want to talk about them. I'm here to talk about them tonight.
p89
aVLadies and gentlemen of the Middle East, here's a serious issue.
p90
aVWhen we see each other, when we say hello,
p91
aVhow many kisses are we going to do?
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VEvery country is different and it's confusing, okay?
p96
aVIn Lebanon, they do three.
p97
aVIn Egypt, they do two.
p98
aVI was in Lebanon, I got used to three.
p99
aVI went to Egypt. I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy,
p100
aVI went, one, two. I went for three \u2014
p101
aVHe wasn't into it.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VI told him, I said, "No, no, I was just in Lebanon."
p106
aVHe goes, "I don't care where you were. You just stay where you are, please."
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p109
aa(lp110
VI went to Saudi Arabia.
p111
aVIn Saudi Arabia, they go one, two, and then they stay on the same side:
p112
aVthree, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
p113
aV10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 \u2014
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VNext time you see a Saudi, look closely.
p118
aVThey're just a little bit tilted.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
V"Abdul, are you okay?"
p123
aa(lp124
V"I was saying hello for half an hour. I'll be all right."
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VQataris, you guys do the nose to nose.
p129
aVWhy is that? Are you too tired to go all the way around?
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V"Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here for a second. Say hello.
p134
aVHello, Habibi. Just don't move. Just stay there, please.
p135
aVI need to rest."
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VIranians, sometimes we do two, sometimes we do three.
p140
aVA friend of mine explained to me, before the '79 revolution, it was two.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAfter the revolution, three.
p145
aVSo with Iranians, you can tell whose side the person is on
p146
aVbased on the number of kisses they give you.
p147
aVYeah, if you go one, two, three \u2014 "I can't believe you support this regime!"
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
V"With your three kisses."
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VBut no, guys, really, it is exciting to be here,
p156
aVand like I said, you guys are doing a lot culturally,
p157
aVyou know, and it's amazing,
p158
aVand it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West.
p159
aVA lot of Americans don't know a lot about us, about the Middle East.
p160
aVI'm Iranian and American. I'm there. I know, I've traveled here.
p161
aVThere's so much, we laugh, right?
p162
aVPeople don't know we laugh.
p163
aVWhen I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour, it came out on Comedy Central,
p164
aVI went online to see what people were saying.
p165
aVI ended up on a conservative website.
p166
aVOne guy wrote another guy. He said, "I never knew these people laughed."
p167
aVThink about it. You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?
p168
aVMaybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha."
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
V"I will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha."
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VBut never like, "Ha ha ha ha la."
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VWe like to laugh. We like to celebrate life.
p181
aVAnd I wish more Americans would travel here.
p182
aVI always encourage my friends:
p183
aV"Travel, see the Middle East,
p184
aVthere's so much to see, so many good people."
p185
aVAnd it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems
p186
aVof misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.
p187
aa(lp188
VFor example, I don't know if you heard about this,
p189
aVa little while ago in the US, there was a Muslim family
p190
aVwalking down the aisle of an airplane,
p191
aVtalking about the safest place to sit on the plane.
p192
aVSome passengers overheard them,
p193
aVsomehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk,
p194
aVgot them kicked off the plane.
p195
aVIt was a family, a mother, father, child, talking about the seating.
p196
aVAs a Middle Eastern male,
p197
aVI know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say
p198
aVon an airplane in the US, right?
p199
aVI'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle,
p200
aVand be like, "Hi, Jack." That's not cool.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VEven if I'm there with my friend named Jack, I say,
p205
aV"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."
p206
aVNever "Hi, Jack."
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VBut now, apparently we can't even talk
p211
aVabout the safest place to sit on an airplane.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends
p214
aVand anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim,
p215
aVso to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone, if you're brown \u2014
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VHere's my advice to my brown friends.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VThe next time you're on an airplane in the US,
p224
aVjust speak your mother tongue.
p225
aVThat way no one knows what you're saying. Life goes on.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VGranted, some mother tongues might sound a little threatening
p230
aVto the average American.
p231
aVIf you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic,
p232
aVyou might freak them out \u2014
p233
aa(lp234
V(Imitating Arabic)
p235
aa(lp236
VThey might say, "What's he talking about?"
p237
aVThe key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,
p238
aVis to throw in random good words to put people at ease
p239
aVas you're walking down the aisle.
p240
aVJust as you're walking down \u2014
p241
aa(lp242
V(Imitating Arabic)
p243
aa(lp244
VStrawberry!
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Imitating Arabic)
p249
aa(lp250
VRainbow!
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
V(Imitating Arabic)
p255
aa(lp256
VTutti Frutti!
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V"I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream."
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you very much. Have a good night.
p263
aVThank you, TED.
