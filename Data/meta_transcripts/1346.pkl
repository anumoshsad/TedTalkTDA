VBecause I usually take the role
p4
aVof trying to explain to people
p5
aVhow wonderful the new technologies
p6
aVthat are coming along are going to be,
p7
aVand I thought that, since I was among friends here,
p8
aVI would tell you what I really think
p9
aVand try to look back and try to understand
p10
aVwhat is really going on here
p11
aVwith these amazing jumps in technology
p12
aVthat seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I'm going to start out
p15
aVby showing just one very boring technology slide.
p16
aVAnd then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
p17
aVThis is just a random slide
p18
aVthat I picked out of my file.
p19
aVWhat I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,
p20
aVbut the general form of it.
p21
aVThis happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing
p22
aVabout the power of RISC microprocessors
p23
aVversus the power of local area networks.
p24
aVAnd the interesting thing about it
p25
aVis that this slide,
p26
aVlike so many technology slides that we're used to,
p27
aVis a sort of a straight line
p28
aVon a semi-log curve.
p29
aVIn other words, every step here
p30
aVrepresents an order of magnitude
p31
aVin performance scale.
p32
aVAnd this is a new thing
p33
aVthat we talk about technology
p34
aVon semi-log curves.
p35
aVSomething really weird is going on here.
p36
aVAnd that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, if you could bring up the lights.
p39
aVIf you could bring up the lights higher,
p40
aVbecause I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
p41
aVNow why do we draw technology curves
p42
aVin semi-log curves?
p43
aVWell the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve
p44
aVwhere, let's say, this is years,
p45
aVthis is time of some sort,
p46
aVand this is whatever measure of the technology
p47
aVthat I'm trying to graph,
p48
aVthe graphs look sort of silly.
p49
aVThey sort of go like this.
p50
aVAnd they don't tell us much.
p51
aVNow if I graph, for instance,
p52
aVsome other technology, say transportation technology,
p53
aVon a semi-log curve,
p54
aVit would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.
p55
aVBut when something like this happens,
p56
aVthings are qualitatively changing.
p57
aVSo if transportation technology
p58
aVwas moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,
p59
aVthen the day after tomorrow,
p60
aVI would be able to get in a taxi cab
p61
aVand be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
p62
aVIt's not moving like that.
p63
aVAnd there's nothing precedented
p64
aVin the history of technology development
p65
aVof this kind of self-feeding growth
p66
aVwhere you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow the question that I'd like to ask is,
p69
aVif you look at these exponential curves,
p70
aVthey don't go on forever.
p71
aVThings just can't possibly keep changing
p72
aVas fast as they are.
p73
aVOne of two things is going to happen.
p74
aVEither it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,
p75
aVuntil something totally different comes along,
p76
aVor maybe it's going to do this.
p77
aVThat's about all it can do.
p78
aVNow I'm an optimist,
p79
aVso I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
p80
aVIf so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now
p81
aVis a transition.
p82
aVWe're sort of on this line
p83
aVin a transition from the way the world used to be
p84
aVto some new way that the world is.
p85
aVAnd so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,
p86
aVis what's this new way that the world is?
p87
aVWhat's that new state that the world is heading toward?
p88
aVBecause the transition seems very, very confusing
p89
aVwhen we're right in the middle of it.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow when I was a kid growing up,
p92
aVthe future was kind of the year 2000,
p93
aVand people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
p94
aVNow here's a conference
p95
aVin which people talk about the future,
p96
aVand you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
p97
aVIt's about as far as we go out.
p98
aVSo in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking
p99
aVone year per year
p100
aVfor my whole lifetime.
p101
aVNow I think that the reason
p102
aVis because we all feel
p103
aVthat something's happening there.
p104
aVThat transition is happening. We can all sense it.
p105
aVAnd we know that it just doesn't make too much sense
p106
aVto think out 30, 50 years
p107
aVbecause everything's going to be so different
p108
aVthat a simple extrapolation of what we're doing
p109
aVjust doesn't make any sense at all.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo what I would like to talk about
p112
aVis what that could be,
p113
aVwhat that transition could be that we're going through.
p114
aVNow in order to do that
p115
aVI'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff
p116
aVthat really has nothing to do
p117
aVwith technology and computers.
p118
aVBecause I think the only way to understand this
p119
aVis to really step back
p120
aVand take a long time scale look at things.
p121
aVSo the time scale that I would like to look at this on
p122
aVis the time scale of life on Earth.
p123
aVSo I think this picture makes sense
p124
aVif you look at it a few billion years at a time.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo if you go back
p127
aVabout two and a half billion years,
p128
aVthe Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock
p129
aVwith a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
p130
aVAnd if you look at the way
p131
aVthat the chemicals got organized,
p132
aVwe begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
p133
aVAnd I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand
p134
aVabout how it started with RNA,
p135
aVbut I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,
p136
aVwhich is that, at that time,
p137
aVthere were little drops of oil floating around
p138
aVwith all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.
p139
aVAnd some of those drops of oil
p140
aVhad a particular combination of chemicals in them
p141
aVwhich caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside
p142
aVand grow the drops of oil.
p143
aVAnd those that were like that
p144
aVstarted to split and divide.
p145
aVAnd those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,
p146
aVthose little drops of oil.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,
p149
aVbecause every one of them
p150
aVwas a little random recipe of chemicals.
p151
aVAnd every time it divided,
p152
aVthey got sort of unequal division
p153
aVof the chemicals within them.
p154
aVAnd so every drop was a little bit different.
p155
aVIn fact, the drops that were different in a way
p156
aVthat caused them to be better
p157
aVat incorporating chemicals around them,
p158
aVgrew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.
p159
aVSo those tended to live longer,
p160
aVget expressed more.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow that's sort of just a very simple
p163
aVchemical form of life,
p164
aVbut when things got interesting
p165
aVwas when these drops
p166
aVlearned a trick about abstraction.
p167
aVSomehow by ways that we don't quite understand,
p168
aVthese little drops learned to write down information.
p169
aVThey learned to record the information
p170
aVthat was the recipe of the cell
p171
aVonto a particular kind of chemical
p172
aVcalled DNA.
p173
aVSo in other words, they worked out,
p174
aVin this mindless sort of evolutionary way,
p175
aVa form of writing that let them write down what they were,
p176
aVso that that way of writing it down could get copied.
p177
aVThe amazing thing is that that way of writing
p178
aVseems to have stayed steady
p179
aVsince it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
p180
aVIn fact the recipe for us, our genes,
p181
aVis exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
p182
aVIn fact, every living creature is written
p183
aVin exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
p184
aa(lp185
VIn fact, one of the things that I did
p186
aVjust for amusement purposes
p187
aVis we can now write things in this code.
p188
aVAnd I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,
p189
aVwhich I try not to let the security people see at airports.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVBut this has in it \u2014
p192
aVwhat I did is I took this code \u2014
p193
aVthe code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it \u2014
p194
aVand I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA
p195
aVand amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
p196
aVSo if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,
p197
aVI have plenty for everyone in the room,
p198
aVand, in fact, everyone in the world,
p199
aVand it's right here.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVIf I had really been a egotist,
p202
aVI would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VSo what was the next step?
p207
aVWriting down the DNA was an interesting step.
p208
aVAnd that caused these cells \u2014
p209
aVthat kept them happy for another billion years.
p210
aVBut then there was another really interesting step
p211
aVwhere things became completely different,
p212
aVwhich is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,
p213
aVso that they began to get communities of cells.
p214
aVI don't know if you know this,
p215
aVbut bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
p216
aVNow that's why, for instance,
p217
aVantibiotic resistance has evolved.
p218
aVSome bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,
p219
aVand it went around sort of creating its little DNA information
p220
aVwith other bacteria,
p221
aVand now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,
p222
aVbecause bacteria communicate.
p223
aVNow what this communication allowed
p224
aVwas communities to form
p225
aVthat, in some sense, were in the same boat together;
p226
aVthey were synergistic.
p227
aVSo they survived
p228
aVor they failed together,
p229
aVwhich means that if a community was very successful,
p230
aVall the individuals in that community
p231
aVwere repeated more
p232
aVand they were favored by evolution.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow the transition point happened
p235
aVwhen these communities got so close
p236
aVthat, in fact, they got together
p237
aVand decided to write down the whole recipe for the community
p238
aVtogether on one string of DNA.
p239
aVAnd so the next stage that's interesting in life
p240
aVtook about another billion years.
p241
aVAnd at that stage,
p242
aVwe have multi-cellular communities,
p243
aVcommunities of lots of different types of cells,
p244
aVworking together as a single organism.
p245
aVAnd in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.
p246
aVWe have lots of cells
p247
aVthat are not out for themselves anymore.
p248
aVYour skin cell is really useless
p249
aVwithout a heart cell, muscle cell,
p250
aVa brain cell and so on.
p251
aVSo these communities began to evolve
p252
aVso that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place
p253
aVwas no longer a cell,
p254
aVbut a community which we call an organism.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow the next step that happened
p257
aVis within these communities.
p258
aVThese communities of cells,
p259
aVagain, began to abstract information.
p260
aVAnd they began building very special structures
p261
aVthat did nothing but process information within the community.
p262
aVAnd those are the neural structures.
p263
aVSo neurons are the information processing apparatus
p264
aVthat those communities of cells built up.
p265
aVAnd in fact, they began to get specialists in the community
p266
aVand special structures
p267
aVthat were responsible for recording,
p268
aVunderstanding, learning information.
p269
aVAnd that was the brains and the nervous system
p270
aVof those communities.
p271
aVAnd that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
p272
aVBecause at that point,
p273
aVan individual \u2014
p274
aVlearning could happen
p275
aVwithin the time span of a single organism,
p276
aVinstead of over this evolutionary time span.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo an organism could, for instance,
p279
aVlearn not to eat a certain kind of fruit
p280
aVbecause it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
p281
aVThat could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,
p282
aVwhereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,
p283
aVthat would have had to be learned evolutionarily
p284
aVover hundreds of thousands of years
p285
aVby the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
p286
aVSo that nervous system,
p287
aVthe fact that they built these special information structures,
p288
aVtremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.
p289
aVBecause evolution could now happen within an individual.
p290
aVIt could happen in learning time scales.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut then what happened
p293
aVwas the individuals worked out,
p294
aVof course, tricks of communicating.
p295
aVAnd for example,
p296
aVthe most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
p297
aVIt's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
p298
aVHere I have a very complicated, messy,
p299
aVconfused idea in my head.
p300
aVI'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,
p301
aVand hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head
p302
aVthat bears some analogy to it.
p303
aVBut we're taking something very complicated,
p304
aVturning it into sound, sequences of sounds,
p305
aVand producing something very complicated in your brain.
p306
aVSo this allows us now
p307
aVto begin to start functioning
p308
aVas a single organism.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd so, in fact, what we've done
p311
aVis we, humanity,
p312
aVhave started abstracting out.
p313
aVWe're going through the same levels
p314
aVthat multi-cellular organisms have gone through \u2014
p315
aVabstracting out our methods of recording,
p316
aVpresenting, processing information.
p317
aVSo for example, the invention of language
p318
aVwas a tiny step in that direction.
p319
aVTelephony, computers,
p320
aVvideotapes, CD-ROMs and so on
p321
aVare all our specialized mechanisms
p322
aVthat we've now built within our society
p323
aVfor handling that information.
p324
aVAnd it all connects us together
p325
aVinto something
p326
aVthat is much bigger
p327
aVand much faster
p328
aVand able to evolve
p329
aVthan what we were before.
p330
aVSo now, evolution can take place
p331
aVon a scale of microseconds.
p332
aVAnd you saw Ty's little evolutionary example
p333
aVwhere he sort of did a little bit of evolution
p334
aVon the Convolution program right before your eyes.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo now we've speeded up the time scales once again.
p337
aVSo the first steps of the story that I told you about
p338
aVtook a billion years a piece.
p339
aVAnd the next steps,
p340
aVlike nervous systems and brains,
p341
aVtook a few hundred million years.
p342
aVThen the next steps, like language and so on,
p343
aVtook less than a million years.
p344
aVAnd these next steps, like electronics,
p345
aVseem to be taking only a few decades.
p346
aVThe process is feeding on itself
p347
aVand becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it \u2014
p348
aVwhen something reinforces its rate of change.
p349
aVThe more it changes, the faster it changes.
p350
aVAnd I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
p351
aVWe're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow I design computers for a living,
p354
aVand I know that the mechanisms
p355
aVthat I use to design computers
p356
aVwould be impossible
p357
aVwithout recent advances in computers.
p358
aVSo right now, what I do
p359
aVis I design objects at such complexity
p360
aVthat it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
p361
aVI don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
p362
aVThere are billions of them.
p363
aVInstead, what I do
p364
aVand what the designers at Thinking Machines do
p365
aVis we think at some level of abstraction
p366
aVand then we hand it to the machine
p367
aVand the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,
p368
aVmuch farther and faster than we could ever do.
p369
aVAnd in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods
p370
aVthat we don't quite even understand.
p371
aa(lp372
VOne method that's particularly interesting
p373
aVthat I've been using a lot lately
p374
aVis evolution itself.
p375
aVSo what we do
p376
aVis we put inside the machine
p377
aVa process of evolution
p378
aVthat takes place on the microsecond time scale.
p379
aVSo for example,
p380
aVin the most extreme cases,
p381
aVwe can actually evolve a program
p382
aVby starting out with random sequences of instructions.
p383
aVSay, "Computer, would you please make
p384
aVa hundred million random sequences of instructions.
p385
aVNow would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,
p386
aVrun all of those programs,
p387
aVand pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."
p388
aVSo in other words, I define what I wanted.
p389
aVLet's say I want to sort numbers,
p390
aVas a simple example I've done it with.
p391
aVSo find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo of course, random sequences of instructions
p394
aVare very unlikely to sort numbers,
p395
aVso none of them will really do it.
p396
aVBut one of them, by luck,
p397
aVmay put two numbers in the right order.
p398
aVAnd I say, "Computer,
p399
aVwould you please now take the 10 percent
p400
aVof those random sequences that did the best job.
p401
aVSave those. Kill off the rest.
p402
aVAnd now let's reproduce
p403
aVthe ones that sorted numbers the best.
p404
aVAnd let's reproduce them by a process of recombination
p405
aVanalogous to sex."
p406
aVTake two programs and they produce children
p407
aVby exchanging their subroutines,
p408
aVand the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.
p409
aVSo I've got now a new generation of programs
p410
aVthat are produced by combinations
p411
aVof the programs that did a little bit better job.
p412
aVSay, "Please repeat that process."
p413
aVScore them again.
p414
aVIntroduce some mutations perhaps.
p415
aVAnd try that again and do that for another generation.
p416
aa(lp417
VWell every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.
p418
aVSo I can do the equivalent
p419
aVof millions of years of evolution on that
p420
aVwithin the computer in a few minutes,
p421
aVor in the complicated cases, in a few hours.
p422
aVAt the end of that, I end up with programs
p423
aVthat are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.
p424
aVIn fact, they are programs that are much more efficient
p425
aVthan programs I could have ever written by hand.
p426
aa(lp427
VNow if I look at those programs,
p428
aVI can't tell you how they work.
p429
aVI've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.
p430
aVThey're obscure, weird programs.
p431
aVBut they do the job.
p432
aVAnd in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job
p433
aVbecause they come from a line
p434
aVof hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
p435
aVIn fact, their life depended on doing the job.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Laughter)
p438
aa(lp439
VI was riding in a 747
p440
aVwith Marvin Minsky once,
p441
aVand he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.
p442
aVIt says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts
p443
aVworking together to make you a safe flight.'
p444
aVDoesn't that make you feel confident?"
p445
aa(lp446
V(Laughter)
p447
aa(lp448
VIn fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well
p449
aVwhen it gets complicated.
p450
aVSo we're beginning to depend on computers
p451
aVto do a process that's very different than engineering.
p452
aVAnd it lets us produce things of much more complexity
p453
aVthan normal engineering lets us produce.
p454
aVAnd yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.
p455
aVSo in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.
p456
aVWe're now using those programs
p457
aVto make much faster computers
p458
aVso that we'll be able to run this process much faster.
p459
aVSo it's feeding back on itself.
p460
aVThe thing is becoming faster
p461
aVand that's why I think it seems so confusing.
p462
aVBecause all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.
p463
aVWe're taking off.
p464
aa(lp465
VAnd what we are is we're at a point in time
p466
aVwhich is analogous to when single-celled organisms
p467
aVwere turning into multi-celled organisms.
p468
