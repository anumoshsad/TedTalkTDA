VI work with children with autism.
p4
aVSpecifically, I make technologies
p5
aVto help them communicate.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, many of the problems that children
p8
aVwith autism face, they have a common source,
p9
aVand that source is that they find it difficult
p10
aVto understand abstraction, symbolism.
p11
aVAnd because of this, they have  a lot of difficulty with language.
p12
aa(lp13
VLet me tell you a little bit about why this is.
p14
aVYou see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.
p15
aVAll of us can see it. All of us understand this.
p16
aVThese are two other pictures of soup,
p17
aVbut you can see that these are more abstract
p18
aVThese are not quite as concrete.
p19
aVAnd when you get to language,
p20
aVyou see that it becomes a word
p21
aVwhose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,
p22
aVhas absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with,
p23
aVor what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.
p24
aVSo it's essentially a completely abstract,
p25
aVa completely arbitrary representation of something
p26
aVwhich is in the real world,
p27
aVand this is something that children with autism
p28
aVhave an incredible amount of difficulty with.
p29
aVNow that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism \u2014
p30
aVspeech therapists, educators \u2014
p31
aVwhat they do is, they try to help children with autism
p32
aVcommunicate not with words, but with pictures.
p33
aVSo if a child with autism wanted to say,
p34
aV"I want soup," that child would pick
p35
aVthree different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup,"
p36
aVand they would put these together,
p37
aVand then the therapist or the parent would
p38
aVunderstand that this is what the kid wants to say.
p39
aVAnd this has been incredibly effective;
p40
aVfor the last 30, 40 years
p41
aVpeople have been doing this.
p42
aVIn fact, a few years back,
p43
aVI developed an app for the iPad
p44
aVwhich does exactly this. It's called Avaz,
p45
aVand the way it works is that kids select
p46
aVdifferent pictures.
p47
aVThese pictures are sequenced together to form sentences,
p48
aVand these sentences are spoken out.
p49
aVSo Avaz is essentially converting pictures,
p50
aVit's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, this was very effective.
p53
aVThere are thousands of children using this,
p54
aVyou know, all over the world,
p55
aVand I started thinking about
p56
aVwhat it does and what it doesn't do.
p57
aVAnd I realized something interesting:
p58
aVAvaz helps children with autism learn words.
p59
aVWhat it doesn't help them do is to learn
p60
aVword patterns.
p61
aVLet me explain this in a little more detail.
p62
aVTake this sentence: "I want soup tonight."
p63
aVNow it's not just the words here that convey the meaning.
p64
aVIt's also the way in which these words are arranged,
p65
aVthe way these words are modified and arranged.
p66
aVAnd that's why a sentence like "I want soup tonight"
p67
aVis different from a sentence like
p68
aV"Soup want I tonight," which  is completely meaningless.
p69
aVSo there is another hidden abstraction here
p70
aVwhich children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with,
p71
aVand that's the fact that you can modify words
p72
aVand you can arrange them to have
p73
aVdifferent meanings, to convey different ideas.
p74
aVNow, this is what we call grammar.
p75
aVAnd grammar is incredibly powerful,
p76
aVbecause grammar is this one component of language
p77
aVwhich takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
p78
aVand allows us to convey an infinite amount of information,
p79
aVan infinite amount of ideas.
p80
aVIt's the way in which you can put things together
p81
aVin order to convey anything you want to.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so after I developed Avaz,
p84
aVI worried for a very long time
p85
aVabout how I could give grammar  to children with autism.
p86
aVThe solution came to me from a very interesting perspective.
p87
aVI happened to chance upon a child with autism
p88
aVconversing with her mom,
p89
aVand this is what happened.
p90
aVCompletely out of the blue, very spontaneously,
p91
aVthe child got up and said, "Eat."
p92
aVNow what was interesting was
p93
aVthe way in which the mom was trying to tease out
p94
aVthe meaning of what the child wanted to say
p95
aVby talking to her in questions.
p96
aVSo she asked, "Eat what? Do  you want to eat ice cream?
p97
aVYou want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?
p98
aVYou want to eat cream now? You want to eat ice cream in the evening?"
p99
aVAnd then it struck me that
p100
aVwhat the mother had done was something incredible.
p101
aVShe had been able to get that child to communicate
p102
aVan idea to her without grammar.
p103
aVAnd it struck me that maybe this is what
p104
aVI was looking for.
p105
aVInstead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,
p106
aVas a sentence, you arrange them
p107
aVin this map, where they're all linked together
p108
aVnot by placing them one after the other
p109
aVbut in questions, in question-answer pairs.
p110
aVAnd so if you do this, then what you're conveying
p111
aVis not a sentence in English,
p112
aVbut what you're conveying is really a meaning,
p113
aVthe meaning of a sentence in English.
p114
aVNow, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language.
p115
aVIt's what comes after thought but before language.
p116
aVAnd the idea was that this particular representation
p117
aVmight convey meaning in its raw form.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I was very excited by this, you know,
p120
aVhopping around all over the place,
p121
aVtrying to figure out if I can convert
p122
aVall possible sentences that I hear into this.
p123
aVAnd I found that this is not enough.
p124
aVWhy is this not enough?
p125
aVThis is not enough because if you wanted to convey
p126
aVsomething like negation,
p127
aVyou want to say, "I don't want soup,"
p128
aVthen you can't do that by asking a question.
p129
aVYou do that by changing the word "want."
p130
aVAgain, if you wanted to say,
p131
aV"I wanted soup yesterday,"
p132
aVyou do that by converting the word "want" into "wanted."
p133
aVIt's a past tense.
p134
aVSo this is a flourish which I added
p135
aVto make the system complete.
p136
aVThis is a map of words joined together
p137
aVas questions and answers,
p138
aVand with these filters applied on top of them
p139
aVin order to modify them to represent
p140
aVcertain nuances.
p141
aVLet me show you this with a different example.
p142
aa(lp143
VLet's take this sentence:
p144
aV"I told the carpenter I could not pay him."
p145
aVIt's a fairly complicated sentence.
p146
aVThe way that this particular system works,
p147
aVyou can start with any part of this sentence.
p148
aVI'm going to start with the word "tell."
p149
aVSo this is the word "tell."
p150
aVNow this happened in the past,
p151
aVso I'm going to make that "told."
p152
aVNow, what I'm going to do is,
p153
aVI'm going to ask questions.
p154
aVSo, who told? I told.
p155
aVI told whom? I told the carpenter.
p156
aVNow we start with a different part of the sentence.
p157
aVWe start with the word "pay,"
p158
aVand we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."
p159
aVThen we make it "can't pay,"
p160
aVand we can make it "couldn't pay"
p161
aVby making it the past tense.
p162
aVSo who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.
p163
aVCouldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.
p164
aVAnd then you join these two together
p165
aVby asking this question:
p166
aVWhat did I tell the carpenter?
p167
aVI told the carpenter I could not pay him.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow think about this. This is
p170
aV\u2014(Applause)\u2014
p171
aVthis is a representation of this sentence
p172
aVwithout language.
p173
aVAnd there are two or three interesting things about this.
p174
aVFirst of all, I could have started anywhere.
p175
aVI didn't have to start with the word "tell."
p176
aVI could have started anywhere in the sentence,
p177
aVand I could have made this entire thing.
p178
aVThe second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,
p179
aVif I was speaking in some other language,
p180
aVthis map would actually hold true in any language.
p181
aVSo long as the questions are standardized,
p182
aVthe map is actually independent of language.
p183
aVSo I call this FreeSpeech,
p184
aVand I was playing with this for many, many months.
p185
aVI was trying out so many different combinations of this.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech.
p188
aVI was trying to convert language,
p189
aVconvert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech,
p190
aVand vice versa, and back and forth.
p191
aVAnd I realized that this particular configuration,
p192
aVthis particular way of representing language,
p193
aVit allowed me to actually create very concise rules
p194
aVthat go between FreeSpeech on one side
p195
aVand English on the other.
p196
aVSo I could actually write this set of rules
p197
aVthat translates from this particular representation into English.
p198
aVAnd so I developed this thing.
p199
aVI developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine
p200
aVwhich takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input
p201
aVand gives out perfectly grammatical English text.
p202
aVAnd by putting these two pieces together,
p203
aVthe representation and the engine,
p204
aVI was able to create an app, a technology for children with autism,
p205
aVthat not only gives them words
p206
aVbut also gives them grammar.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo I tried this out with kids with autism,
p209
aVand I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification.
p210
aVThey were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech
p211
aVwhich were much more complicated but much more effective
p212
aVthan equivalent sentences in English,
p213
aVand I started thinking about
p214
aVwhy that might be the case.
p215
aVAnd I had an idea, and I want to  talk to you about this idea next.
p216
aVIn about 1997, about 15 years back,
p217
aVthere were a group of scientists that were trying
p218
aVto understand how the brain processes language,
p219
aVand they found something very interesting.
p220
aVThey found that when you learn a language
p221
aVas a child, as a two-year-old,
p222
aVyou learn it with a certain part of your brain,
p223
aVand when you learn a language as an adult \u2014
p224
aVfor example, if I wanted to learn Japanese right now \u2014
p225
aVa completely different part of my brain is used.
p226
aVNow I don't know why that's the case,
p227
aVbut my guess is that that's because
p228
aVwhen you learn a language as an adult,
p229
aVyou almost invariably learn it
p230
aVthrough your native language, or through your first language.
p231
aVSo what's interesting about FreeSpeech
p232
aVis that when you create a sentence
p233
aVor when you create language,
p234
aVa child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech,
p235
aVthey're not using this support language,
p236
aVthey're not using this bridge language.
p237
aVThey're directly constructing the sentence.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd so this gave me this idea.
p240
aVIs it possible to use FreeSpeech
p241
aVnot for children with autism
p242
aVbut to teach language to people without disabilities?
p243
aVAnd so I tried a number of experiments.
p244
aVThe first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle
p245
aVin which these questions and answers
p246
aVare coded in the form of shapes,
p247
aVin the form of colors,
p248
aVand you have people putting these together
p249
aVand trying to understand how this works.
p250
aVAnd I built an app out of it, a game out of it,
p251
aVin which children can play with words
p252
aVand with a reinforcement,
p253
aVa sound reinforcement of visual structures,
p254
aVthey're able to learn language.
p255
aVAnd this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,
p256
aVand the government of India recently
p257
aVlicensed this technology from us,
p258
aVand they're going to try it out with millions of different children
p259
aVtrying to teach them English.
p260
aVAnd the dream, the hope, the vision, really,
p261
aVis that when they learn English this way,
p262
aVthey learn it with the same proficiency
p263
aVas their mother tongue.
p264
aa(lp265
VAll right, let's talk about something else.
p266
aVLet's talk about speech.
p267
aVThis is speech.
p268
aVSo speech is the primary mode of communication
p269
aVdelivered between all of us.
p270
aVNow what's interesting about speech is that
p271
aVspeech is one-dimensional.
p272
aVWhy is it one-dimensional?
p273
aVIt's one-dimensional because it's sound.
p274
aVIt's also one-dimensional because
p275
aVour mouths are built that way.
p276
aVOur mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound.
p277
aVBut if you think about the brain,
p278
aVthe thoughts that we have in our heads
p279
aVare not one-dimensional.
p280
aVI mean, we have these rich,
p281
aVcomplicated, multi-dimensional ideas.
p282
aVNow, it seems to me that language
p283
aVis really the brain's invention
p284
aVto convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought
p285
aVon one hand
p286
aVinto speech on the other hand.
p287
aVNow what's interesting is that
p288
aVwe do a lot of work in information nowadays,
p289
aVand almost all of that is done in the language domain.
p290
aVTake Google, for example.
p291
aVGoogle trawls all these countless billions of websites,
p292
aVall of which are in English, and when you want to use Google,
p293
aVyou go into Google search, and you type in English,
p294
aVand it matches the English with the English.
p295
aVWhat if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?
p296
aVI have a suspicion that if we did this,
p297
aVwe'd find that algorithms like searching,
p298
aVlike retrieval, all of these things,
p299
aVare much simpler and also more effective,
p300
aVbecause they don't process the data structure of speech.
p301
aVInstead they're processing the data structure of thought.
p302
aVThe data structure of thought.
p303
aVThat's a provocative idea.
p304
aa(lp305
VBut let's look at this in a little more detail.
p306
aVSo this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.
p307
aVWe have the Free Speech representation on one side,
p308
aVand we have the FreeSpeech  Engine, which generates English.
p309
aVNow if you think about it,
p310
aVFreeSpeech, I told you, is completely  language-independent.
p311
aVIt doesn't have any specific information in it
p312
aVwhich is about English.
p313
aVSo everything that this system knows about English
p314
aVis actually encoded into the engine.
p315
aVThat's a pretty interesting concept in itself.
p316
aVYou've encoded an entire human language
p317
aVinto a software program.
p318
aVBut if you look at what's inside the engine,
p319
aVit's actually not very complicated.
p320
aVIt's not very complicated code.
p321
aVAnd what's more interesting is the fact that
p322
aVthe vast majority of the code in that engine
p323
aVis not really English-specific.
p324
aVAnd that gives this interesting idea.
p325
aVIt might be very easy for us to actually
p326
aVcreate these engines in many, many different languages,
p327
aVin Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.
p328
aVAnd that gives another interesting idea.
p329
aVFor example, supposing I was a writer,
p330
aVsay, for a newspaper or for a magazine.
p331
aVI could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,
p332
aVand the person who's consuming that content,
p333
aVthe person who's reading that particular information
p334
aVcould choose any engine,
p335
aVand they could read it in their own mother tongue,
p336
aVin their native language.
p337
aVI mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,
p338
aVespecially for India.
p339
aVWe have so many different languages.
p340
aVThere's a song about India, and there's a description
p341
aVof the country as, it says,
p342
aV(in Sanskrit).
p343
aVThat means "ever-smiling speaker
p344
aVof beautiful languages."
p345
aa(lp346
VLanguage is beautiful.
p347
aVI think it's the most beautiful of human creations.
p348
aVI think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented.
p349
aVIt entertains, it educates, it enlightens,
p350
aVbut what I like the most about language
p351
aVis that it empowers.
p352
aa(lp353
VI want to leave you with this.
p354
aVThis is a photograph of my collaborators,
p355
aVmy earliest collaborators
p356
aVwhen I started working on language
p357
aVand autism and various other things.
p358
aVThe girl's name is Pavna,
p359
aVand that's her mother, Kalpana.
p360
aVAnd Pavna's an entrepreneur,
p361
aVbut her story is much more remarkable than mine,
p362
aVbecause Pavna is about 23.
p363
aVShe has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,
p364
aVso ever since she was born,
p365
aVshe could neither move nor talk.
p366
aVAnd everything that she's accomplished so far,
p367
aVfinishing school, going to college,
p368
aVstarting a company,
p369
aVcollaborating with me to develop Avaz,
p370
aVall of these things she's done
p371
aVwith nothing more than moving her eyes.
p372
aa(lp373
VDaniel Webster said this:
p374
aVHe said, "If all of my possessions were taken
p375
aVfrom me with one exception,
p376
aVI would choose to keep the power of communication,
p377
aVfor with it, I would regain all the rest."
p378
aVAnd that's why, of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech,
p379
aVthe one that's closest to my heart
p380
aVstill remains the ability for this
p381
aVto empower children with disabilities
p382
aVto be able to communicate,
p383
aVthe power of communication,
p384
aVto get back all the rest.
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
p387
aV(Applause)
p388
aVThank you. (Applause)
p389
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
