VI read poetry all the time
p4
aVand write about it frequently
p5
aVand take poems apart
p6
aVto see how they work
p7
aVbecause I'm a word person.
p8
aVI understand the world best, most fully,
p9
aVin words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,
p10
aVand when I have a new experience or a new feeling,
p11
aVI'm a little frustrated
p12
aVuntil I can try to put it into words.
p13
aVI think I've always been that way.
p14
aVI devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.
p15
aVAnd I found poems by Andrew Marvell
p16
aVand Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson
p17
aVand William Butler Yeats
p18
aVbecause they were quoted in science fiction,
p19
aVand I loved their sounds
p20
aVand I went on to read about ottava rima
p21
aVand medial caesuras and enjambment
p22
aVand all that other technical stuff
p23
aVthat you care about if you already care about poems,
p24
aVbecause poems already made me happier
p25
aVand sadder and more alive.
p26
aVAnd I became a poetry critic
p27
aVbecause I wanted to know how and why.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose
p30
aVany more than music or computer programming
p31
aVserve one purpose.
p32
aVThe greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,"
p33
aVand poetry is a set of techniques,
p34
aVways of making patterns
p35
aVthat put emotions into words.
p36
aVThe more techniques you know,
p37
aVthe more things you can make,
p38
aVand the more patterns you can recognize
p39
aVin things you might already like or love.
p40
aa(lp41
VThat said, poetry does seem to be
p42
aVespecially good at certain things.
p43
aVFor example, we are all going to die.
p44
aVPoetry can help us live with that.
p45
aVPoems are made of words, nothing but words.
p46
aVThe particulars in poems are like
p47
aVthe particularities, the personalities,
p48
aVthat distinguish people from one another.
p49
aVPoems are easy to share, easy to pass on,
p50
aVand when you read a poem, you can imagine
p51
aVsomeone's speaking to you or for you,
p52
aVmaybe even someone far away
p53
aVor someone made up or someone deceased.
p54
aVThat's why we can go to poems when we want to
p55
aVremember something or someone,
p56
aVto celebrate or to look beyond death
p57
aVor to say goodbye,
p58
aVand that's one reason poems can seem important,
p59
aVeven to people who aren't me,
p60
aVwho don't so much live in a world of words.
p61
aVThe poet Frank O'Hara said,
p62
aV"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"
p63
aVbut he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore,
p64
aVthe thought that he wouldn't write any more poems
p65
aVhad stopped him.
p66
aVPoetry helps me want to be alive,
p67
aVand I want to show you why by showing you how,
p68
aVhow a couple of poems react to the fact that
p69
aVwe're alive in one place at one time in one culture,
p70
aVand in another we won't be alive at all.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo here's one of the first poems I memorized.
p73
aVIt could address a child or an adult.
p74
aa(lp75
V"From far, from eve and morning
p76
aa(lp77
VFrom yon twelve-winded sky,
p78
aa(lp79
VThe stuff of life to knit me
p80
aa(lp81
VBlew hither; here am I.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow \u2014 for a breath I tarry
p84
aa(lp85
VNor yet disperse apart \u2014
p86
aa(lp87
VTake my hand quick and tell me,
p88
aa(lp89
VWhat have you in your heart.
p90
aa(lp91
VSpeak now, and I will answer;
p92
aa(lp93
VHow shall I help you, say;
p94
aa(lp95
VEre to the wind's twelve quarters
p96
aa(lp97
VI take my endless way."
p98
aa(lp99
V[A. E. Housman]
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, this poem has appealed
p102
aVto science fiction writers.
p103
aVIt's furnished at least three science fiction titles,
p104
aVI think because it says poems can brings us news
p105
aVfrom the future or the past
p106
aVor across the world,
p107
aVbecause their patterns can seem to tell you
p108
aVwhat's in somebody's heart.
p109
aVIt says poems can bring people together temporarily,
p110
aVwhich I think is true,
p111
aVand it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes
p112
aVbut for how it rhymes,
p113
aVcleanly and simply on the two and four,
p114
aV"say" and "way,"
p115
aVwith anticipatory hints on the one and three,
p116
aV"answer" and "quarters,"
p117
aVas if the poem itself were coming together.
p118
aVIt plays up the fact that we die
p119
aVby exaggerating the speed of our lives.
p120
aVA few years on Earth become
p121
aVone speech, one breath.
p122
aVIt's a poem about loneliness \u2014
p123
aVthe "I" in the poem feels no connection will last \u2014
p124
aVand it might look like a plea for help
p125
aV'til you get to the word "help,"
p126
aVwhere this "I" facing you, taking your hand,
p127
aVis more like a teacher or a genie,
p128
aVor at least that's what he wants to believe.
p129
aVIt would not be the first time a poet had
p130
aVwritten the poem that he wanted to hear.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, this next poem really changed
p133
aVwhat I liked and what I read
p134
aVand what I felt I could read as an adult.
p135
aVIt might not make any sense to you
p136
aVif you haven't seen it before.
p137
aa(lp138
V"The Garden"
p139
aa(lp140
V"Oleander: coral
p141
aa(lp142
Vfrom lipstick ads in the 50's.
p143
aa(lp144
VFruit of the tree of such knowledge
p145
aa(lp146
VTo smack (thin air)
p147
aa(lp148
Vmeaning kiss or hit.
p149
aa(lp150
VIt appears
p151
aa(lp152
Vin the guise of outworn usages
p153
aa(lp154
Vbecause we are bad?
p155
aa(lp156
VBig masculine threat,
p157
aa(lp158
Vinsinuating and slangy."
p159
aa(lp160
V[Rae Armantrout]
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, I found this poem in an anthology
p163
aVof almost equally confusing poems in 1989.
p164
aVI just heard that there were these scandalous writers
p165
aVcalled Language poets who didn't make any sense,
p166
aVand I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like,
p167
aVand some of them didn't do much for me,
p168
aVbut this writer, Rae Armantrout,
p169
aVdid an awful lot, and I kept reading her
p170
aVuntil I felt I knew what was going on,
p171
aVas I do with this poem.
p172
aa(lp173
VIt's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall
p174
aVand the Biblical story of the Fall,
p175
aVin which sex as we know it
p176
aVand death and guilt
p177
aVcome into the world at the same time.
p178
aVIt's also about how appearances deceive,
p179
aVhow our culture can sweep us along
p180
aVinto doing and saying things we didn't intend
p181
aVor don't like, and Armantrout's style
p182
aVis trying to help us stop or slow down.
p183
aV"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,
p184
aVas in lip-smacking,
p185
aVbut that can lead to "smack" as in "hit"
p186
aVas in domestic abuse,
p187
aVbecause sexual attraction can seem threatening.
p188
aVThe red that means fertility
p189
aVcan also mean poison.
p190
aVOleander is poisonous.
p191
aVAnd outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss"
p192
aVor "hit" can help us see
p193
aVhow our unacknowledged assumptions
p194
aVcan make us believe we are bad,
p195
aVeither because sex is sinful
p196
aVor because we tolerate so much sexism.
p197
aVWe let guys tell women what to do.
p198
aVThe poem reacts to old lipstick ads,
p199
aVand its edginess about statement,
p200
aVits reversals and halts, have everything to do
p201
aVwith resisting the language of ads
p202
aVthat want to tell us so easily what to want,
p203
aVwhat to do, what to think.
p204
aVThat resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,
p205
aVwhich shows me, Armantrout shows me
p206
aVwhat it's like to hear grave threats
p207
aVand mortal dishonesty in the language
p208
aVof everyday life, and once she's done that,
p209
aVI think she can show other people, women and men,
p210
aVwhat it's like to feel that way
p211
aVand say to other people, women and men
p212
aVwho feel so alienated or so threatened
p213
aVthat they're not alone.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, how do I know that I'm right
p216
aVabout this somewhat confusing poem?
p217
aVWell in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk
p218
aVand she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it."
p219
aVYeah. (Laughter) (Applause)
p220
aVBut usually, you can't know. You never know.
p221
aVYou can't be sure, and that's okay.
p222
aVAll we can do we is listen to poems
p223
aVand look at poems and guess
p224
aVand see if they can bring us what we need,
p225
aVand if you're wrong about some part of a poem,
p226
aVnothing bad will happen.
p227
aVNow, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,
p228
aVbut a little younger than A. E. Housman's.
p229
aa(lp230
V"The Brave Man"
p231
aa(lp232
V"The sun, that brave man,
p233
aa(lp234
VComes through boughs that lie in wait,
p235
aa(lp236
VThat brave man.
p237
aa(lp238
VGreen and gloomy eyes
p239
aa(lp240
VIn dark forms of the grass
p241
aa(lp242
VRun away.
p243
aa(lp244
VThe good stars,
p245
aa(lp246
VPale helms and spiky spurs,
p247
aa(lp248
VRun away.
p249
aa(lp250
VFears of my bed,
p251
aa(lp252
VFears of life and fears of death,
p253
aa(lp254
VRun away.
p255
aa(lp256
VThat brave man comes up
p257
aa(lp258
VFrom below and walks without meditation,
p259
aa(lp260
VThat brave man."
p261
aa(lp262
V[Wallace Stevens]
p263
aa(lp264
VNow, the sun in this poem,
p265
aVin Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave
p266
aVbecause the person in the poem is so afraid.
p267
aVThe sun comes up in the morning through branches,
p268
aVdispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,
p269
aVand defeats stars envisioned as armies.
p270
aV"Brave" has its old sense of showy
p271
aVas well as its modern sense, courage.
p272
aVThis sun is not afraid to show his face.
p273
aVBut the person in the poem is afraid.
p274
aVHe might have been up all night.
p275
aVThat is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza,
p276
aVwhere run away has become a refrain.
p277
aVThis person might want to run away too,
p278
aVbut fortified by the sun's example,
p279
aVhe might just rise.
p280
aVStevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation"
p281
aVfor the end.
p282
aVUnlike the sun, human beings think.
p283
aVWe meditate on past and future, life and death,
p284
aVabove and below.
p285
aVAnd it can make us afraid.
p286
aa(lp287
VPoems, the patterns in poems,
p288
aVshow us not just what somebody thought
p289
aVor what someone did or what happened
p290
aVbut what it was like to be a person like that,
p291
aVto be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,
p292
aVso goofy, so preposterous, so brave.
p293
aVThat's why poems can seem at once so durable,
p294
aVso personal, and so ephemeral,
p295
aVlike something inside and outside you at once.
p296
aVThe Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry
p297
aVto a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,
p298
aVand the American poet Terrance Hayes
p299
aVwrote six poems called "Wind in a Box."
p300
aVOne of them asks, "Tell me,
p301
aVwhat am I going to do when I'm dead?"
p302
aVAnd the answer is that he'll stay with us
p303
aVor won't stay with us inside us as wind,
p304
aVas air, as words.
p305
aa(lp306
VIt is easier than ever to find poems
p307
aVthat might stay inside you, that might stay with you,
p308
aVfrom long, long ago, or from right this minute,
p309
aVfrom far away or from right close to where you live,
p310
aValmost no matter where you live.
p311
aVPoems can help you say, help you show how you're feeling,
p312
aVbut they can also introduce you
p313
aVto feelings, ways of being in the world,
p314
aVpeople, very much unlike you,
p315
aVmaybe even people from long, long ago.
p316
aVSome poems even tell you
p317
aVthat that is what they can do.
p318
aVThat's what John Keats is doing
p319
aVin his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.
p320
aVIt's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,
p321
aVhe probably left it unfinished,
p322
aVand because it might be meant
p323
aVfor a character in a play,
p324
aVbut it might just be Keats' thinking
p325
aVabout what his own writing,
p326
aVhis handwriting, could do,
p327
aVand in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,
p328
aVand I hear the power of older poetic techniques,
p329
aVand I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,
p330
aVof meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,
p331
aVsomeone else from long ago,
p332
aVsomeone quite memorable.
p333
aa(lp334
V"This living hand, now warm and capable
p335
aa(lp336
VOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,
p339
aa(lp340
VSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
p341
aa(lp342
VThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood
p343
aa(lp344
VSo in my veins red life might stream again,
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd thou be conscience-calm\u2019d \u2014 see here it is \u2014
p347
aa(lp348
VI hold it towards you."
p349
aa(lp350
