VWhat I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear
p4
aVand the cost of fear
p5
aVand the age of fear from which we are now emerging.
p6
aVI would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that
p7
aVby letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety.
p8
aVI'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI could worry before I could walk.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VPlease, applaud that.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VThank you.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear.
p23
aVWe were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid
p24
aVand taught how to put our coats over our heads
p25
aVto protect us from global thermonuclear war.
p26
aVNow even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work.
p27
aVBut I also knew
p28
aVthat global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years
p31
aVwith the threat of such a war,
p32
aVthe response of our government and of our society
p33
aVwas to do wonderful things.
p34
aVWe created the space program in response to that.
p35
aVWe built our highway system in response to that.
p36
aVWe created the Internet in response to that.
p37
aVSo sometimes fear can produce a constructive response.
p38
aVBut sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response.
p39
aa(lp40
VOn September 11, 2001,
p41
aV19 guys took over four airplanes
p42
aVand flew them into a couple of buildings.
p43
aVThey exacted a horrible toll.
p44
aVIt is not for us to minimize what that toll was.
p45
aVBut the response that we had was clearly disproportionate \u2014
p46
aVdisproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged.
p47
aVWe rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States
p48
aVand of many governments
p49
aVto address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place,
p50
aVwas quite limited.
p51
aVIn fact, according to our intelligence services,
p52
aVon September 11, 2001,
p53
aVthere were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.
p54
aVThere were just a few thousand terrorists.
p55
aVThey posed an existential threat
p56
aVto no one.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut we rearranged our entire national security apparatus
p59
aVin the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War.
p60
aVWe launched two wars.
p61
aVWe spent trillions of dollars.
p62
aVWe suspended our values.
p63
aVWe violated international law.
p64
aVWe embraced torture.
p65
aVWe embraced the idea
p66
aVthat if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it.
p67
aVAnd therefore, for the first time in history,
p68
aVwe were seeing everybody as a threat.
p69
aVAnd what was the result of that?
p70
aVSurveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls
p71
aVof entire countries \u2014
p72
aVhundreds of millions of people \u2014
p73
aVsetting aside whether those countries were our allies,
p74
aVsetting aside what our interests were.
p75
aVI would argue that 15 years later,
p76
aVsince today there are more terrorists,
p77
aVmore terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties \u2014
p78
aVthis by the count of the U.S. State Department \u2014
p79
aVsince today the region from which those attacks emanate
p80
aVis more unstable than at any time in its history,
p81
aVsince the Flood, perhaps,
p82
aVwe have not succeeded in our response.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow you have to ask, where did we go wrong?
p85
aVWhat did we do? What was the mistake that was made?
p86
aVAnd you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place.
p87
aVThere are political food fights.
p88
aVWe've turned our discourse into a cage match.
p89
aVAnd that's true.
p90
aVBut there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction,
p91
aVeven though I would argue
p92
aVthat dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done
p93
aVin the richest and most powerful country in the world
p94
aVis far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do,
p95
aVbecause it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut there are other problems.
p98
aVAnd the other problems
p99
aVcame from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now,
p100
aVwe're in a creativity crisis.
p101
aVIn Washington, in think tanks,
p102
aVwhere people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas,
p103
aVyou don't get bold new ideas,
p104
aVbecause if you offer up a bold new idea,
p105
aVnot only are you attacked on Twitter,
p106
aVbut you will not get confirmed in a government job.
p107
aVBecause we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate,
p108
aVyou get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality,
p109
aVtiny groups of people making decisions.
p110
aVWhen you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions,
p111
aVwhat do you get?
p112
aVYou get groupthink.
p113
aVEverybody has the same worldview,
p114
aVand any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat.
p115
aVThat's a danger.
p116
aVYou also have processes that become reactive to news cycles.
p117
aVAnd so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight, that look forward,
p118
aVthat do strategy \u2014
p119
aVthe parts in other governments that do this \u2014 can't do it,
p120
aVbecause they're reacting to the news cycle.
p121
aVAnd so we're not looking ahead.
p122
aa(lp123
VOn 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way.
p124
aVToday we have a crisis because, because of 9/11,
p125
aVwe are still looking in the wrong direction,
p126
aVand we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon
p127
aVthat are far more important than what we saw on 9/11;
p128
aVfar more important than the threat posed by these terrorists;
p129
aVfar more important even than the instability that we've got
p130
aVin some areas of the world that are racked by instability today.
p131
aVIn fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world
p132
aVmay be symptoms.
p133
aVThey may be a reaction to bigger trends.
p134
aVAnd if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend,
p135
aVthen we've got far bigger problems to deal with.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so what are those trends?
p138
aVWell, to a group like you,
p139
aVthe trends are apparent.
p140
aVWe are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society
p141
aVis being rewoven.
p142
aVIf you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago \u2014
p143
aVit said that 80 percent of the people on the planet,
p144
aVby the year 2020, would have a smartphone.
p145
aVThey would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket.
p146
aVIn most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent.
p147
aVWe passed the point last October
p148
aVwhen there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,
p149
aVout in the world than there were people.
p150
aVWe are within years of a profound moment in our history,
p151
aVwhen effectively every single human being on the planet
p152
aVis going to be part of a man-made system for the first time,
p153
aVable to touch anyone else \u2014
p154
aVtouch them for good, touch them for ill.
p155
aVAnd the changes associated with that are changing the very nature
p156
aVof every aspect of governance and life on the planet
p157
aVin ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about,
p158
aVwhen they're thinking about these immediate threats.
p159
aa(lp160
VOn the security side,
p161
aVwe've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,
p162
aVand so we didn't,
p163
aVto a period that I call Cool War, cyber war,
p164
aVwhere the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop.
p165
aVWe may enter a period of constant warfare,
p166
aVand we know this because we've been in it for several years.
p167
aVAnd yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard.
p168
aVWe don't have the basic ideas formulated.
p169
aVIf someone attacks us with a cyber attack,
p170
aVdo have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack?
p171
aVWe don't know.
p172
aVIf somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them?
p173
aVWhen China launched a series of cyber attacks,
p174
aVwhat did the U.S. government do?
p175
aVIt said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys,
p176
aVwho are never coming to America.
p177
aVThey're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer
p178
aVwho's going to take them into custody.
p179
aVIt's a gesture \u2014 it's not a deterrent.
p180
aa(lp181
VSpecial forces operators out there in the field today
p182
aVdiscover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones
p183
aVhave access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had.
p184
aVIn fact, if you've got a cell phone,
p185
aVyou've got access to power that a superpower didn't have,
p186
aVand would have highly classified 10 years ago.
p187
aVIn my cell phone, I have an app that tells me
p188
aVwhere every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed,
p189
aVand what kind of aircraft it is,
p190
aVand where it's going and where it's landing.
p191
aVThey have apps that allow them to know
p192
aVwhat their adversary is about to do.
p193
aVThey're using these tools in new ways.
p194
aVWhen a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist,
p195
aVhe went in with a rifle...
p196
aVand an iPad.
p197
aVAnd the weapon was the iPad.
p198
aVBecause he captured people, he terrorized them,
p199
aVhe pointed the iPad at them,
p200
aVand then he took the video and he put it on the Internet,
p201
aVand he took over the world's media.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut it doesn't just affect the security side.
p204
aVThe relations between great powers \u2014
p205
aVwe thought we were past the bipolar era.
p206
aVWe thought we were in a unipolar world,
p207
aVwhere all the big issues were resolved.
p208
aVRemember? It was the end of history.
p209
aVBut we're not.
p210
aVWe're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet \u2014
p211
aVthat it was going to connect us, weave society together \u2014
p212
aVare not necessarily true.
p213
aVIn countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China.
p214
aVYou've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders
p215
aVwe control it within our borders.
p216
aVWe control the content. We are going to control our security.
p217
aVWe are going to manage that Internet.
p218
aVWe are going to say what can be on it.
p219
aVWe're going to set a different set of rules.
p220
aVNow you might think, well, that's just China.
p221
aVBut it's not just China.
p222
aVIt's China, India, Russia.
p223
aVIt's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil.
p224
aVAfter the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,
p225
aVthey said, let's create a new Internet backbone,
p226
aVbecause we can't be dependent on this other one.
p227
aVAnd so all of a sudden, what do you have?
p228
aVYou have a new bipolar world
p229
aVin which cyber-internationalism,
p230
aVour belief,
p231
aVis challenged by cyber-nationalism,
p232
aVanother belief.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe are seeing these changes everywhere we look.
p235
aVWe are seeing the advent of mobile money.
p236
aVIt's happening in the places you wouldn't expect.
p237
aVIt's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,
p238
aVwhere millions of people who haven't had access to financial services
p239
aVnow conduct all those services on their phones.
p240
aVThere are 2.5 million people who don't have financial service access
p241
aVthat are going to get it soon.
p242
aVA billion of them are going to have the ability to access it
p243
aVon their cell phone soon.
p244
aVIt's not just going to give them the ability to bank.
p245
aVIt's going to change what monetary policy is.
p246
aVIt's going to change what money is.
p247
aVEducation is changing in the same way.
p248
aVHealthcare is changing in the same way.
p249
aVHow government services are delivered is changing in the same way.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd yet, in Washington, we are debating
p252
aVwhether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq
p253
aVISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.
p254
aVWe are trying to determine
p255
aVhow much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians
p256
aVon a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago,
p257
aVwhen in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us
p258
aVand we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing
p259
aVto talk about the attacks that are being waged on them.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd that gets us to another breakdown
p262
aVthat's crucial,
p263
aVand another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this,
p264
aVbecause the growth of America and real American national security
p265
aVand all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War,
p266
aVwas a public-private partnership between science, technology and government
p267
aVthat began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory
p268
aVinventing new things.
p269
aVBut it was the canals and railroads and telegraph;
p270
aVit was radar and the Internet.
p271
aVIt was Tang, the breakfast drink \u2014
p272
aVprobably not the most important of those developments.
p273
aVBut what you had was a partnership and a dialogue,
p274
aVand the dialogue has broken down.
p275
aVIt's broken down because in Washington,
p276
aVless government is considered more.
p277
aVIt's broken down because there is, believe it or not,
p278
aVin Washington, a war on science \u2014
p279
aVdespite the fact that in all of human history,
p280
aVevery time anyone has waged a war on science,
p281
aVscience has won.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VBut we have a government that doesn't want to listen,
p286
aVthat doesn't have people at the highest levels
p287
aVthat understand this.
p288
aVIn the nuclear age,
p289
aVwhen there were people in senior national security jobs,
p290
aVthey were expected to speak throw-weight.
p291
aVThey were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary.
p292
aVIf you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now
p293
aVand said, "Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience,
p294
aVabout the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow,"
p295
aVyou'd get a blank stare.
p296
aVI know, because when I wrote this book,
p297
aVI talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side,
p298
aVwho felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table.
p299
aVMeanwhile, on the tech side,
p300
aVwe have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things,
p301
aVbut they started in garages and they didn't need the government
p302
aVand they don't want the government.
p303
aVMany of them have a political view that's somewhere between
p304
aVlibertarian and anarchic:
p305
aVleave me alone.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut the world's coming apart.
p308
aVAll of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes
p309
aVand massive issues associated with conflict
p310
aVand massive issues associated with security and privacy.
p311
aVAnd we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues,
p312
aVwhich are philosophical issues.
p313
aVIf you can't vote, if you can't have a job,
p314
aVif you can't bank, if you can't get health care,
p315
aVif you can't be educated without Internet access,
p316
aVis Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions?
p317
aVIf Internet access is a fundamental right,
p318
aVis electricity access for the 1.2 billion who don't have access to electricity
p319
aVa fundamental right?
p320
aVThese are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers?
p321
aVWhere's the dialogue?
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd that brings me to the reason that I'm here.
p324
aVI live in Washington. Pity me.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VThe dialogue isn't happening there.
p329
aVThese big issues that will change the world,
p330
aVchange national security, change economics,
p331
aVcreate hope, create threats,
p332
aVcan only be resolved when you bring together
p333
aVgroups of people who understand science and technology
p334
aVback together with government.
p335
aVBoth sides need each other.
p336
aVAnd until we recreate that connection,
p337
aVuntil we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow,
p338
aVthen we are going to grow ever more vulnerable.
p339
aVThe risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured
p340
aVin terms of lives lost by terror attacks
p341
aVor buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent.
p342
aVThey'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues
p343
aVand our inability to get together
p344
aVscientists, technologists, government leaders,
p345
aVat a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,
p346
aVakin to the beginning of the major transformational eras
p347
aVthat have happened on Earth,
p348
aVand start coming up with, if not the right answers,
p349
aVthen at least the right questions.
p350
aa(lp351
VWe are not there yet,
p352
aVbut discussions like this and groups like you
p353
aVare the places where those questions can be formulated and posed.
p354
aVAnd that's why I believe that groups like TED,
p355
aVdiscussions like this around the planet,
p356
aVare the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy,
p357
aVof social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place.
p358
aVAnd that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you.
p359
aa(lp360
