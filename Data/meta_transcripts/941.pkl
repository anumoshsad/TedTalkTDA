VSo I work in marketing, which I love,
p4
aVbut my first passion was physics,
p5
aVa passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,
p6
aVwhen I had a little less gray hair.
p7
aVSo he taught me
p8
aVthat physics is cool
p9
aVbecause it teaches us so much about the world around us.
p10
aVAnd I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you
p11
aVthat physics can teach us something about marketing.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo quick show of hands \u2014
p14
aVwho studied some marketing in university?
p15
aVWho studied some physics in university?
p16
aVPretty good. And at school?
p17
aVOkay, lots of you.
p18
aVSo, hopefully this will bring back some happy,
p19
aVor possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, physics and marketing.
p22
aVWe'll start with something very simple \u2014 Newton's Law:
p23
aV"The force equals mass times acceleration."
p24
aVThis is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines
p25
aVshould have studied a bit more carefully
p26
aVbefore they ran this campaign.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVBut if we rearrange this formula quickly,
p29
aVwe can get to acceleration equals force over mass,
p30
aVwhich means
p31
aVthat for a larger particle \u2014 a larger mass \u2014
p32
aVit requires more force to change its direction.
p33
aVIt's the same with brands:
p34
aVthe more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,
p35
aVthe more force is needed to change its positioning.
p36
aVAnd that's one of the reasons why
p37
aVArthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture
p38
aVrather than try to persuade the world
p39
aVthat Andersen's could stand for something
p40
aVother than accountancy.
p41
aVIt explains why Hoover
p42
aVfound it very difficult to persuade the world
p43
aVthat it was more than vacuum cleaners,
p44
aVand why companies like Unilever and P&G
p45
aVkeep brands separate,
p46
aVlike Ariel and Pringles and Dove
p47
aVrather than having one giant parent brand.
p48
aVSo the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object
p49
aVthe more force is needed
p50
aVto change its direction.
p51
aVThe marketing is, the bigger a brand,
p52
aVthe more difficult it is to reposition it.
p53
aVSo think about a portfolio of brands
p54
aVor maybe new brands for new ventures.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
p57
aVGetting a little more technical now.
p58
aVSo this says that
p59
aVit's impossible, by definition,
p60
aVto measure exactly the state \u2014 i.e., the position \u2014
p61
aVand the momentum of a particle,
p62
aVbecause the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
p63
aVSo to explain that \u2014 if you've got an elementary particle
p64
aVand you shine a light on it,
p65
aVthen the photon of light has momentum,
p66
aVwhich knocks the particle,
p67
aVso you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
p68
aVBy measuring it,
p69
aVthe act of measurement changes it.
p70
aVThe act of observation changes it.
p71
aVIt's the same in marketing.
p72
aVSo with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
p73
aVThink about the group of moms
p74
aVwho are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,
p75
aVand almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
p76
aVAnd yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
p77
aVThink about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,
p78
aVwho stuff their trolleys
p79
aVfull of fresh green vegetables and fruit,
p80
aVbut don't shop like that any other day.
p81
aVAnd if you think about the number of people
p82
aVwho claim in surveys
p83
aVto regularly look for porn on the Web,
p84
aVit's very few.
p85
aVYet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
p86
aVSo luckily, the science \u2014
p87
aVno, sorry \u2014 the marketing is getting easier.
p88
aVLuckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,
p89
aVmore digital media consumption,
p90
aVyou can measure more what consumers actually do,
p91
aVrather than what they say they do.
p92
aVSo the physics is
p93
aVyou can never accurately and exactly
p94
aVmeasure a particle,
p95
aVbecause the observation changes it.
p96
aVThe marketing is \u2014 the message for marketing is \u2014
p97
aVthat try to measure what consumers actually do,
p98
aVrather than what they say they'll do
p99
aVor anticipate they'll do.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo next, the scientific method \u2014
p102
aVan axiom of physics, of all science \u2014
p103
aVsays you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,
p104
aVyou can only disprove it.
p105
aVWhat this means is you can gather more and more data
p106
aVaround a hypothesis or a positioning,
p107
aVand it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
p108
aVAnd only one contrary data point
p109
aVcan blow your theory out of the water.
p110
aVSo if we take an example \u2014
p111
aVPtolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory
p112
aVthat the planets would rotate around the Earth.
p113
aVIt only took one robust observation from Copernicus
p114
aVto blow that idea out of the water.
p115
aVAnd there are parallels for marketing \u2014
p116
aVyou can invest for a long time in a brand,
p117
aVbut a single contrary observation of that positioning
p118
aVwill destroy consumers' belief.
p119
aVTake BP \u2014
p120
aVthey spent millions of pounds over many years
p121
aVbuilding up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,
p122
aVbut then one little accident.
p123
aVThink about Toyota.
p124
aVIt was, for a long time, revered
p125
aVas the most reliable of cars,
p126
aVand then they had the big recall incident.
p127
aVAnd Tiger Woods, for a long time,
p128
aVthe perfect brand ambassador.
p129
aVWell, you know the story.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVSo the physics is
p132
aVthat you cannot prove a hypothesis,
p133
aVbut it's easy to disprove it \u2014
p134
aVany hypothesis is shaky.
p135
aVAnd the marketing is
p136
aVthat not matter how much you've invested in your brand,
p137
aVone bad week can undermine decades of good work.
p138
aVSo be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups
p139
aVthat can undermine your brand.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy \u2014
p142
aVthe second law of thermodynamics.
p143
aVThis says that entropy,
p144
aVwhich is a measure of the disorder of a system,
p145
aVwill always increase.
p146
aVThe same is true of marketing.
p147
aVIf we go back 20 years,
p148
aVthe one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager
p149
aVcould pretty much define a brand.
p150
aVBut where we are today, things have changed.
p151
aVYou can get a strong brand image
p152
aVor a message
p153
aVand put it out there like the Conservative Party did
p154
aVearlier this year with their election poster.
p155
aVBut then you lose control of it.
p156
aVWith the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools
p157
aVthat are available now to every consumer,
p158
aVit's impossible to control where it goes.
p159
aVYour brand starts being dispersed,
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVit gets more chaotic.
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVIt's out of your control.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVI actually saw him speak \u2014 he did a good job.
p166
aVBut while this may be unsettling for marketers,
p167
aVit's actually a good thing.
p168
aVThis distribution of brand energy
p169
aVgets your brand closer to the people,
p170
aVmore in with the people.
p171
aVIt makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,
p172
aVwhich is ultimately good for your brand.
p173
aVSo, the lesson from physics is
p174
aVthat entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
p175
aVThe message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
p176
aVYou can't fight it, so embrace it
p177
aVand find a way to work with it.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo to close,
p180
aVmy teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me
p181
aVthat physics is cool,
p182
aVand hopefully, I've convinced you
p183
aVthat physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
p184
aVThank you.
