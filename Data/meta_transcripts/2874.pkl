VSo, I teach college students about inequality and race in education,
p4
aVand I like to leave my office open to any of my students
p5
aVwho might just want to see me to chat.
p6
aVAnd a few semesters ago,
p7
aVone of my more cheerful students, Mahari,
p8
aVactually came to see me
p9
aVand mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black.
p10
aVHe had just transferred to NYU from a community college
p11
aVon a merit scholarship,
p12
aVand turns out,
p13
aVonly about five percent of students at NYU are black.
p14
aVAnd so I started to remember
p15
aVthat I know that feeling of being an outsider
p16
aVin your own community.
p17
aVIt's partially what drew me to my work.
p18
aa(lp19
VAt my university,
p20
aVI'm one of the few faculty members of color,
p21
aVand growing up, I experienced my family's social mobility,
p22
aVmoving out of apartments into a nice house,
p23
aVbut in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood.
p24
aVI was 12,
p25
aVand kids would say that were surprised that I didn't smell like curry.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VThat's because school is in the morning,
p30
aVand I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VCurry is for dinner.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo when Mahari was leaving,
p39
aVI asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated.
p40
aVAnd he said that despite feeling lonely,
p41
aVhe just threw himself at his work,
p42
aVthat he built strategies around his grit
p43
aVand his desire to be successful.
p44
aVA mentor of mine is actually Dr. Angela Duckworth,
p45
aVthe psychologist at UPenn who has defined this stick-to-itiveness of grit
p46
aVas being "the perseverance and passion for long-term goals."
p47
aVAngela's book has become a bestseller,
p48
aVand schools across the country,
p49
aVparticularly charter schools,
p50
aVhave become interested in citing "grit" as a core value.
p51
aVBut sometimes grit isn't enough,
p52
aVespecially in education.
p53
aVSo when Mahari was leaving my office,
p54
aVI worried that he might need something more specific
p55
aVto combat the challenges that he mentioned to me.
p56
aa(lp57
VAs a sociologist, I also study achievement,
p58
aVbut from a slightly different perspective.
p59
aVI research students who have overcome immense obstacles
p60
aVrelated to their background.
p61
aVStudents from low-income,
p62
aVoften single-parent households,
p63
aVstudents who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,
p64
aVor some who have struggled with substance abuse
p65
aVor lived through violent or sexual trauma.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met.
p68
aVTyrique was raised by a single mother,
p69
aVand then after high school, he fell in with the wrong crowd.
p70
aVHe got arrested for armed robbery.
p71
aVBut in prison, he started to work hard.
p72
aVHe took college credit courses,
p73
aVso when he got out, he was able to get a master's,
p74
aVand today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
p75
aVVanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,
p76
aVfrom the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx.
p77
aVShe was raised primarily by her extended family,
p78
aVbecause her own mother had a heroin addiction.
p79
aVYet at 15,
p80
aVVanessa had to drop out of school,
p81
aVand she had a son of her own.
p82
aVBut eventually, she was able to go to community college,
p83
aVget her associate's,
p84
aVthen go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo some people might hear these stories and say,
p87
aV"Yes, those two definitely have grit.
p88
aVThey basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps."
p89
aVBut that's an incomplete picture,
p90
aVbecause what's more important
p91
aVis that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency,
p92
aVor their specific capacity
p93
aVto actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing
p94
aVand navigate the system given their circumstances.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, allow me to elaborate.
p97
aVIn prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first,
p98
aVas a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
p99
aVThis is until an older detainee took him aside
p100
aVand asked him to help with the youth program.
p101
aVAnd in mentoring youth,
p102
aVhe started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens.
p103
aVThis is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses.
p104
aVAnd when he got out,
p105
aVhe got a job with Fortune Society,
p106
aVwhere many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated.
p107
aVSo then he was able to get a master's in social work,
p108
aVand today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform.
p109
aVAnd Vanessa ...
p110
aVwell, after the birth of her son,
p111
aVshe happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation
p112
aVthat gave her 20 dollars biweekly,
p113
aVa MetroCard
p114
aVand her first experiences with a computer.
p115
aVThese simple resources are what helped her get her GED,
p116
aVbut then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure,
p117
aVwhich was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney.
p118
aVShe spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant.
p119
aVAfter that,
p120
aVher mentors at community college had kept in touch with her,
p121
aVand so she was able to go,
p122
aVand they put her in an honors program.
p123
aVAnd that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted
p124
aVto one of the most elite colleges for women in the country,
p125
aVand she received her bachelor's at 36,
p126
aVsetting an incredible example for her young son.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social
p129
aVand benefits from social scaffolding.
p130
aVThere were factors pushing these two in one direction,
p131
aVbut through tailored mentorship and opportunities,
p132
aVthey were able to reflect on their circumstances
p133
aVand resist negative influences.
p134
aVThey also learned simple skills like developing a network,
p135
aVor asking for help \u2014
p136
aVthings many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time,
p137
aVor can take for granted.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd when we think of people like this,
p140
aVwe should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
p141
aVThinking of them as exceptions absolves us
p142
aVof the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations.
p143
aVWhen Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump,
p144
aVhave called education "the civil rights issue of our time,"
p145
aVperhaps we should treat it that way.
p146
aVIf schools were able to think about the agency that their students have
p147
aVand bring to the table when they push them,
p148
aVwhat students learn can become more relevant to their lives,
p149
aVand then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo this here \u2014
p152
aVMy student Mahari
p153
aVgot accepted to law school with scholarships,
p154
aVand not to brag,
p155
aVbut I did write one of his letters of recommendation.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement,
p160
aVI've seen him find his voice along the way,
p161
aVwhich as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward,
p162
aVI know it takes time and support.
p163
aVSo even though he will rely a lot on his grit
p164
aVto get him through that first-year law school grind,
p165
aVI'll be there as a mentor for him,
p166
aVcheck in with him from time to time,
p167
aVmaybe take him out to get some curry ...
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
Vso that he can keep growing his agency to succeed even more.
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you.
