VSo, raise your hand if you've seen somebody in your city
p4
aVstanding on a corner, holding a sign like this.
p5
aVI think we all have.
p6
aVIf you're being honest,
p7
aVat least one time, have you wondered if they mean it?
p8
aVIf we offered them a job, would they really take it?
p9
aVAnd what would that job mean to them in their lives?
p10
aVWell, this is a story about what happened in my city
p11
aVwhen we decided to find out,
p12
aVwhen we decided to think differently about panhandling,
p13
aVand lift people up through the dignity of work.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe call it, "There's a Better Way."
p16
aVWe call it There's a Better Way
p17
aVbecause I believe there's a better way to get the money you need
p18
aVthan panhandling on the corner.
p19
aVI believe there's a better way to help your brothers and sisters in need
p20
aVthan handing a few dollars out the car window.
p21
aVWe know there's dignity in work.
p22
aVWe also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves
p23
aVif they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first.
p24
aVAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate,
p25
aVit always feels good to hand a couple of dollars to someone
p26
aVthat is in need.
p27
aVBut if you talk to panhandlers, many of them will tell you
p28
aVthat your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body,
p29
aVthey go towards feeding an addiction.
p30
aVThere's a better way.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy name is Richard Berry,
p33
aVand I have one of the best jobs in the world.
p34
aVI get to be the mayor of a great American city,
p35
aVAlbuquerque, New Mexico.
p36
aVI was at lunch on July 17, 2015, in my great American city,
p37
aVand on my way back to city hall,
p38
aVI saw this gentleman standing on a corner.
p39
aVAs you can see, he's holding a sign,
p40
aVand his sign says he wants a job.
p41
aVBut if you look closer at the picture,
p42
aVyou'll see he's standing underneath a blue sign,
p43
aVand that sign says, if you need help, if you need food or shelter
p44
aVor you'd like to donate,
p45
aVplease call 311, our community service number.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo why is this guy standing underneath my sign with his sign?
p48
aVWell, we wondered if anybody would call that 311 sign,
p49
aVand as it turns out, they did \u2014
p50
aV11,000 times people called.
p51
aVI put those up in about 30 intersections.
p52
aVAnd we did connect them with food and shelter and services.
p53
aVBut yet he's still standing under my sign
p54
aVwith a sign that says he wants a job.
p55
aVIt's simple: he wants a job.
p56
aVSo I decided to do something rare in government.
p57
aVI decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated.
p58
aVI went back to my office, I gathered my staff around
p59
aVand I said, "We're going to take this man at his word,
p60
aVand others like him.
p61
aVThe man says he wants a job, we're going to give him a job,
p62
aVand we're going to make our city an even better place in the meantime."
p63
aa(lp64
VYou see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.
p65
aVWe're a mile high,
p66
aVthe Sandia Mountains on the east,
p67
aVthe Rio Grande runs through the center of the city;
p68
aVwe're the home of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.
p69
aVOn a day like today,
p70
aVyou could literally ski this morning and golf this afternoon.
p71
aVBut there's always something to do \u2014
p72
aValways weeds to pull, litter to pick up.
p73
aVIf you're going to have an initiative like this in your city,
p74
aVyou have to ask yourself two questions.
p75
aVFirst one is: Is there anything left to do in your city?
p76
aVAnd if the answer is no,
p77
aVwould you please give me your mayor's phone number,
p78
aVbecause I need some advice.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VBut the second question you have to ask is this:
p83
aVAre your solutions to panhandling working?
p84
aVIf you're like Albuquerque,
p85
aVand you're taking the punitive approach like we used to,
p86
aVhanding out tickets to panhandlers or those who give them money,
p87
aVI'm going to suggest that your solutions aren't working,
p88
aVand I know you're not getting to the root of your problem in your city.
p89
aVSo if you have something to do
p90
aVand you need people that need something to do,
p91
aVthere's a better way.
p92
aVAnd the good news is, it's not that complicated.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis a 2006 Dodge van.
p95
aVIt was in my motor pool not doing anything.
p96
aVWe put some new tires on it, wrapped it with a logo.
p97
aVThis van now goes out to street corners where our panhandlers are \u2014
p98
aVwe go to them.
p99
aVWe stop the van, we get out,
p100
aVwe ask them if they would like a day's work
p101
aVrather than panhandling for the day.
p102
aVAnd if you wondered if they really mean it \u2014
p103
aVit takes us about an hour to fill this van up in the morning,
p104
aVbecause almost everybody we ask takes a job for the day.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut you need more than just a van.
p107
aVYou need a super-fantastic human being to drive that van.
p108
aVAnd my super-fantastic human being, his name is Will.
p109
aVThis is him in the yellow vest.
p110
aVWill works at our local nonprofit partner.
p111
aVHe works with the homeless every day.
p112
aVThe panhandlers trust him,
p113
aVhe believes in them,
p114
aVhe hustles.
p115
aVI like to say, "Where there's a Will, there's a way."
p116
aVSo if you're going to do the Better Way campaign in your city,
p117
aVyou need to find yourself a Will,
p118
aVbecause he's really one of the keys to making this successful
p119
aVin the city of Albuquerque.
p120
aa(lp121
VYou also need a great nonprofit partner.
p122
aVOurs is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.
p123
aVThey've been in our community for over 30 years.
p124
aVThey provide counseling, food, shelter,
p125
aVand if they don't provide it,
p126
aVthey know somebody in our city that does.
p127
aVBut they do something much more for me as the mayor.
p128
aVThey provide agility.
p129
aVYou see, it takes me two weeks,
p130
aVmaybe two months sometimes,
p131
aVto onboard an employee with the city of Albuquerque.
p132
aVSo you could imagine \u2014
p133
aVmy old Dodge van,
p134
aVmy super-fantastic human being, Will,
p135
aVa great local nonprofit partner \u2014
p136
aVthey drive to the corner, there's a panhandler,
p137
aVthey say, "Would you like to work for the day?"
p138
aVThe panhandler says, "Yes,"
p139
aVand Will says, "Great! I'll be back in six weeks to pick you up."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VIt wouldn't work.
p144
aVIt's really important that we have that agility in our program.
p145
aVAnd they do the paperwork,
p146
aVthey do the insurance,
p147
aVthey do all of the other forms that I can't do quickly.
p148
aa(lp149
VWe pay our panhandlers nine dollars an hour.
p150
aVWe feed them once at the jobsite.
p151
aVAt the end of the day,
p152
aVour old Dodge van takes them right back to St. Martin's,
p153
aVand they get connected with counseling services.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo far,
p156
aVwith the pilot program and a couple days a week,
p157
aVand a fantastic human being and a Dodge van,
p158
aVwe've cleaned up 400 city blocks in the city of Albuquerque.
p159
aVWe've picked up over 117,000 pounds of trash, weeds and litter.
p160
aVI don't know if you've ever weighed a tumbleweed,
p161
aVbut they don't weigh much,
p162
aVso you can imagine the volume of material that we've picked up.
p163
aa(lp164
VMy city has 6,000 employees,
p165
aVand none better than my solid waste department.
p166
aVWe send our trucks out at the end of the day,
p167
aVthey help the panhandlers put into the truck
p168
aVthe material they've picked up during the day,
p169
aVand we take it to the landfill.
p170
aVI'm lucky that I have city employees
p171
aVthat are willing to work side by side with our panhandlers.
p172
aVThey're lifting up our city while lifting up their lives.
p173
aVAnd like anything else \u2014 listen, it takes resources.
p174
aVBut the good news is it doesn't take much.
p175
aVWe started with an old van,
p176
aVa super-fantastic human being,
p177
aVa great local nonprofit
p178
aVand $50,000.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut we also had to have community trust.
p181
aVAnd fortunately, we had built that up in years prior to Better Way.
p182
aVWe have a program called "Albuquerque Heading Home,"
p183
aVa Housing First model where we house the chronically homeless,
p184
aVand when I told my community we wanted to do that differently,
p185
aVI said there's a smart way to do the right thing.
p186
aVWe have now housed 650 chronically homeless, medically vulnerable \u2014
p187
aVfrankly, most likely to die on the streets in our city.
p188
aVWe commissioned our university, they studied it.
p189
aVWe could tell the taxpayers, we can save you 31.6 percent
p190
aVover the cost of leaving someone to struggle for survival on the streets.
p191
aVWe've now saved over five million dollars while housing 650 people.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo we had that community trust,
p194
aVbut we had to have a little bit more of an honest conversation also
p195
aVas a community,
p196
aVbecause we had to get people to understand
p197
aVthat when they hand those five dollars out the window,
p198
aVthey might actually be minimizing their opportunity
p199
aVto help the person in need, and here's why:
p200
aVthat five dollars might go to buying some fast food today \u2014
p201
aVa lot of times it goes to buying drugs and alcohol.
p202
aVThat same five dollars,
p203
aVif you gave it to one of our shelters,
p204
aVcould feed seven people today.
p205
aVAnd if you gave it to one of our local food banks or food pantries,
p206
aVwe could actually feed 20 people with that money.
p207
aa(lp208
VPeople ask,"Well, Albuquerque is 600,000 people \u2014 million, metro \u2014
p209
aVthis wouldn't work in our city, we're too big, we're too small."
p210
aVI disagree; if you have one panhandler on one city block,
p211
aVyou can do this.
p212
aVIf you live in a city of eight-and-half million people,
p213
aVyou can do this.
p214
aVIt doesn't matter what you do.
p215
aVIt's not the work that you do, it's the dignity of the work.
p216
aVYou could do anything.
p217
aVSo I think any city could do this.
p218
aVAnd people say to me,
p219
aV"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.
p220
aVIt can't work that way."
p221
aa(lp222
VBut I tell you what, friends:
p223
aVwhen you go to a street corner
p224
aVand you engage with a panhandler with dignity and respect,
p225
aVmaybe for the first time in years, maybe in their life,
p226
aVand you tell them that you believe in them
p227
aVand that this is their city as much as it's your city,
p228
aVand that you actually need their help to make our place better,
p229
aVand you understand that this isn't the answer to all their problems,
p230
aVbut at least it's a start,
p231
aVan amazing thing happens.
p232
aVWhen they get out on the jobsite and they start working together,
p233
aVyou start seeing amazing things happen.
p234
aVThey see teamwork; they see the fact that they can make a difference.
p235
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p236
aVwhen they get back to St. Martin's in that old Dodge van,
p237
aVthey're much more likely to sign up for whatever services they need \u2014
p238
aVsubstance abuse, mental health counseling, you name it.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo far with our pilot program,
p241
aVwe've offered about 1,700 days of day work.
p242
aVWe've connected 216 people to permanent employment opportunities.
p243
aVTwenty people actually qualified for our Housing First model,
p244
aVHeading Home,
p245
aVand they've been housed.
p246
aVAnd over 150 people have been connected
p247
aVto mental health substance abuse services
p248
aVthrough There's a Better Way.
p249
aa(lp250
VThis is me just two weeks ago,
p251
aVat St. Martin's,
p252
aVdoing our point-in-time survey
p253
aVthat we do every two years.
p254
aVI'm interviewing a gentleman who's homeless, like we do,
p255
aVgetting his information, figuring out where he's from,
p256
aVhow he got there,
p257
aVwhat we can do to help him.
p258
aVAnd you notice he's holding the same sign that the guy was holding in 2015,
p259
aVsame sign I walked out with here today.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo you have to ask yourself: Is it really making a difference?
p262
aVAbsolutely it's making a difference.
p263
aVAlbuquerque is now one of the national leaders
p264
aVin combating some of the most stubborn and persistent social issues
p265
aVthat we have.
p266
aVCombined with Albuquerque Heading Home,
p267
aVthe Better Way program,
p268
aVAlbuquerque has reduced unsheltered homelessness in our city
p269
aVby 80 percent last year.
p270
aVSince I took over as mayor,
p271
aVwe've been able to reduce the chronic homeless population in our city
p272
aVby 40 percent.
p273
aVAnd by HUD's definition,
p274
aVwe've gotten to functional zero,
p275
aVwhich means we've literally ended veteran homelessness
p276
aVin the city of Albuquerque,
p277
aVby being intentional.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VSo I'm happy to report that other cities are hearing about this,
p282
aVother mayors are calling us \u2014
p283
aVChicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas \u2014
p284
aVand are now starting to implement programs
p285
aVwhere they bring the dignity of work to the equation.
p286
aVAnd I can't wait to learn from them.
p287
aVI can't wait to see what their experiment looks like,
p288
aVwhat their pilot project looks like,
p289
aVso we can start taking a collective approach nationally
p290
aVthrough the dignity of work.
p291
aVAnd I want to commend them \u2014
p292
aVthe mayors, their communities, their nonprofits \u2014
p293
aVfor the work that they're doing.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo who's next?
p296
aVAre you and your city ready to step up?
p297
aVAre you ready to think differently about these persistent social issues?
p298
aVAre you ready to lift people up in your community
p299
aVthrough the dignity of work,
p300
aVand make your city profoundly better in many ways?
p301
aVWell, if you are, my friends, I promise you there is a better way.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you.
