VI want to introduce you to an amazing woman.
p4
aVHer name is Davinia.
p5
aVDavinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18,
p6
aVand now lives just outside of Washington, DC.
p7
aVShe's not a high-powered political staffer,
p8
aVnor a lobbyist.
p9
aVShe'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable,
p10
aVbut she's having the most remarkable impact.
p11
aVWhat's incredible about Davinia
p12
aVis that she's willing to spend time every single week
p13
aVfocused on people who are not her:
p14
aVpeople not her in her neighborhood, her state, nor even in her country \u2014
p15
aVpeople she'd likely never meet.
p16
aa(lp17
VDavinia's impact started a few years ago
p18
aVwhen she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook,
p19
aVand asked them to donate their pennies
p20
aVso she could fund girls' education.
p21
aVShe wasn't expecting a huge response,
p22
aVbut 700,000 pennies later,
p23
aVshe's now sent over 120 girls to school.
p24
aVWhen we spoke last week,
p25
aVshe told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank
p26
aVevery time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow \u2014 Davinia is not alone.
p29
aVFar from it.
p30
aVShe's part of a growing movement.
p31
aVAnd there's a name for people like Davinia:
p32
aVglobal citizens.
p33
aVA global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost
p34
aVnot as a member of a state, a tribe or a nation,
p35
aVbut as a member of the human race,
p36
aVand someone who is prepared to act on that belief,
p37
aVto tackle our world's greatest challenges.
p38
aVOur work is focused on finding,
p39
aVsupporting and activating global citizens.
p40
aVThey exist in every country
p41
aVand among every demographic.
p42
aa(lp43
VI want to make the case to you today
p44
aVthat the world's future depends on global citizens.
p45
aVI'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world,
p46
aVthen every single one of the major challenges we face \u2014
p47
aVfrom poverty, climate change, gender inequality \u2014
p48
aVthese issues become solvable.
p49
aVThey are ultimately global issues,
p50
aVand they can ultimately only be solved
p51
aVby global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, some people's immediate reaction to this idea
p54
aVis that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening.
p55
aVSo I'd like to share with you a little of my story today,
p56
aVhow I ended up here,
p57
aVhow it connects with Davinia
p58
aVand, hopefully, with you.
p59
aa(lp60
VGrowing up in Melbourne, Australia,
p61
aVI was one of those seriously irritating little kids
p62
aVthat never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"
p63
aVYou might have been one yourself.
p64
aVI used to ask my mum the most annoying questions.
p65
aVI'd ask her questions like, "Mum, why I can't I dress up
p66
aVand play with puppets all day?"
p67
aV"Why do you want fries with that?"
p68
aV"What is a shrimp,
p69
aVand why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie?"
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V"And mum \u2014 this haircut.
p74
aVWhy?"
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VThe worst haircut, I think.
p79
aVStill terrible.
p80
aa(lp81
VAs a "why" kid, I thought I could change the world,
p82
aVand it was impossible to convince me otherwise.
p83
aVAnd when I was 12 and in my first year of high school,
p84
aVI started raising money for communities in the developing world.
p85
aVWe were a really enthusiastic group of kids,
p86
aVand we raised more money than any other school in Australia.
p87
aVAnd so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more.
p88
aVIt was 1998.
p89
aVWe were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila.
p90
aVIt was there I became friends with Sonny Boy,
p91
aVwho lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage.
p92
aV"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.
p93
aVBut don't let the romance of that name fool you,
p94
aVbecause it was nothing more than a rancid landfill
p95
aVthat kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day
p96
aVto find something, anything of value.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever,
p99
aVbecause when it came time to go to sleep,
p100
aVwe simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom
p101
aVwith myself, Sonny Boy, and the rest of his family,
p102
aVseven of us in this long line,
p103
aVwith the smell of rubbish all around us
p104
aVand cockroaches crawling all around.
p105
aVAnd I didn't sleep a wink,
p106
aVbut I lay awake thinking to myself,
p107
aV"Why should anyone have to live like this
p108
aVwhen I have so much?
p109
aVWhy should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams
p110
aVbe determined by where he's born,
p111
aVor what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'"
p112
aVI just didn't get it,
p113
aVand I needed to understand why.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, I only later came to understand
p116
aVthat the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines
p117
aVwas the result of decisions made or not made, man-made,
p118
aVby a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments
p119
aVwho had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart.
p120
aVSure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have.
p121
aVAnd if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy,
p122
aVit wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars
p123
aVor to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived,
p124
aVbecause the core of the problem lay elsewhere.
p125
aVAnd as I worked on community development projects over the coming years
p126
aVtrying to help build schools,
p127
aVtrain teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,
p128
aVI came to see that community development
p129
aVshould be driven by communities themselves,
p130
aVand that although charity is necessary, it's not sufficient.
p131
aVWe need to confront these challenges
p132
aVon a global scale and in a systemic way.
p133
aVAnd the best thing I could do
p134
aVis try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home
p135
aVto insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change.
p136
aa(lp137
VThat's why, a few years later,
p138
aVI joined with a group of college friends
p139
aVin bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia.
p140
aVWe had this dream of staging this small concert
p141
aVaround the time of the G20 with local Aussie artists,
p142
aVand it suddenly exploded one day
p143
aVwhen we got a phone call from Bono, the Edge and Pearl Jam,
p144
aVwho all agreed to headline our concert.
p145
aVI got a little bit excited that day, as you can see.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VBut to our amazement,
p150
aVthe Australian government heard our collective voices,
p151
aVand they agreed to double investment into global health and development \u2014
p152
aVan additional 6.2 billion dollars.
p153
aVIt felt like \u2014
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VIt felt like this incredible validation.
p158
aVBy rallying citizens together, we helped persuade our government
p159
aVto do the unthinkable,
p160
aVand act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut here's the thing:
p163
aVit didn't last.
p164
aVSee, there was a change in government,
p165
aVand six years later, all that new money
p166
aVdisappeared.
p167
aVWhat did we learn?
p168
aVWe learned that one-off spikes are not enough.
p169
aVWe needed a sustainable movement,
p170
aVnot one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician
p171
aVor the hint of an economic downturn.
p172
aVAnd it needed to happen everywhere;
p173
aVotherwise, every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism
p174
aVthat they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd so this is what we embarked upon.
p177
aVAnd as we embarked upon this challenge, we asked ourselves,
p178
aVhow do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army
p179
aVto win these fights for the long term?
p180
aVWe could only think of one way.
p181
aVWe needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement
p182
aVof people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign
p183
aVinto long-term passion.
p184
aVIt had to be part of their identity.
p185
aVSo in 2012, we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal.
p186
aVAnd there was only one name for it:
p187
aVGlobal Citizen.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut this is not about any one organization.
p190
aVThis is about citizens taking action.
p191
aVAnd research data tells us
p192
aVthat of the total population who even care about global issues,
p193
aVonly 18 percent have done anything about it.
p194
aVIt's not that people don't want to act.
p195
aVIt's often that they don't know how to take action,
p196
aVor that they believe that their actions will have no effect.
p197
aVSo we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens
p198
aVin dozens of countries
p199
aVto put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd as we did so, we discovered something really thrilling,
p202
aVthat when you make global citizenship your mission,
p203
aVyou suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies.
p204
aVSee, extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global.
p205
aVSo, too, is climate change,
p206
aVhuman rights, gender equality,
p207
aVeven conflict.
p208
aVWe found ourselves shoulder to shoulder
p209
aVwith people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut how did we actually go about recruiting
p212
aVand engaging those global citizens?
p213
aVWell, we used the universal language:
p214
aVmusic.
p215
aVWe launched the Global Citizen Festival
p216
aVin the heart of New York City in Central Park,
p217
aVand we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate.
p218
aVWe made sure that these festivals coincided
p219
aVwith the UN General Assembly meeting,
p220
aVso that leaders who need to hear our voices
p221
aVcouldn't possible ignore them.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut there was a twist:
p224
aVyou couldn't buy a ticket.
p225
aVYou had to earn it.
p226
aVYou had to take action on behalf of a global cause,
p227
aVand only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify.
p228
aVActivism is the currency.
p229
aVI had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing.
p230
aVFor me, citizenship means you have to act, and that's what we required.
p231
aVAnd amazingly, it worked.
p232
aVLast year, more than 155,000 citizens in the New York area alone
p233
aVearned enough points to qualify.
p234
aVGlobally, we've now signed up citizens in over 150 countries around the world.
p235
aVAnd last year, we signed up more than 100,000 new members
p236
aVeach and every week of the whole year.
p237
aa(lp238
VSee, we don't need to create global citizens from nothing.
p239
aVWe're already everywhere.
p240
aVWe just need to be organized
p241
aVand motivated to start acting.
p242
aVAnd this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia,
p243
aVwho started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012.
p244
aVHere's what she did.
p245
aVIt wasn't rocket science.
p246
aVShe started writing letters,
p247
aVemailing politicians' offices.
p248
aVShe volunteered her time in her local community.
p249
aVThat's when she got active on social media
p250
aVand started to collect pennies \u2014
p251
aVa lot of pennies.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you.
p254
aVHow will that achieve anything?
p255
aVWell, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone.
p256
aVHer actions, alongside 142,000 other global citizens',
p257
aVled the US government to double their investment
p258
aVinto Global Partnership for Education.
p259
aVAnd here's Dr. Raj Shah,
p260
aVthe head of USAID, making that announcement.
p261
aVSee, when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other,
p262
aVit's amazing to see their collective power.
p263
aVGlobal citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank
p264
aVto boost their investment into water and sanitation.
p265
aVHere's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage
p266
aVat Global Citizen,
p267
aVand Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment
p268
aVto put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019.
p269
aVGlobal citizens encouraged by the late-night host Stephen Colbert
p270
aVlaunched a Twitter invasion on Norway.
p271
aVErna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, got the message,
p272
aVcommitting to double investment into girls' education.
p273
aVGlobal citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian, UK,
p274
aVand Australian governments
p275
aVto boost their investment into polio eradication.
p276
aVThey got together and committed 665 million dollars.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut despite all of this momentum,
p279
aVwe face some huge challenges.
p280
aVSee, you might be thinking to yourself,
p281
aVhow can we possibly persuade world leaders
p282
aVto sustain a focus on global issues?
p283
aVIndeed, the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said,
p284
aV"All politics is local."
p285
aVThat's what always got politicians elected:
p286
aVto seek, gain and hold onto power
p287
aVthrough the pursuit of local or at very best national interests.
p288
aa(lp289
VI experienced this for the first time when I was 21 years old.
p290
aVI took a meeting
p291
aVwith a then-Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless \u2014
p292
aa(lp293
V[Alexander Downer]
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd behind closed doors,
p298
aVI shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty.
p299
aVI said, "Minister \u2014 Australia has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
p300
aVto help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
p301
aVWe can do this."
p302
aVAnd he paused,
p303
aVlooked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes,
p304
aVand he said, "Hugh,
p305
aVno one gives a funk about foreign aid."
p306
aVExcept he didn't use the word "funk."
p307
aVHe went on.
p308
aVHe said we need to look after our own backyard first.
p309
aa(lp310
VThis is, I believe,
p311
aVoutdated, even dangerous thinking.
p312
aVOr as my late grandfather would say,
p313
aVcomplete BS.
p314
aVParochialism offers this false dichotomy
p315
aVbecause it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another.
p316
aVIt pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another.
p317
aVThe whole world is our backyard,
p318
aVand we ignore it at our peril.
p319
aVSee, look what happened when we ignored Rwanda,
p320
aVwhen we ignore Syria,
p321
aVwhen we ignore climate change.
p322
aVPolitical leaders ought to give a "funk"
p323
aVbecause the impact of climate change and extreme poverty
p324
aVcomes right to our shore.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow, global citizens \u2014 they understand this.
p327
aVWe live in a time that favors the global citizen,
p328
aVin an age where every single voice can be heard.
p329
aVSee, do you remember
p330
aVwhen the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year 2000?
p331
aVThe most we could do in those days was fire off a letter
p332
aVand wait for the next election.
p333
aVThere was no social media.
p334
aVToday, billions of citizens have more tools,
p335
aVmore access to information,
p336
aVmore capacity to influence than ever before.
p337
aVBoth the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us.
p338
aVThe world has changed,
p339
aVand those of us who look beyond our borders
p340
aVare on the right side of history.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo where are we?
p343
aVSo we run this amazing festival,
p344
aVwe've scored some big policy wins,
p345
aVand citizens are signing up all over the world.
p346
aVBut have we achieved our mission?
p347
aVNo.
p348
aVWe have such a long way to go.
p349
aa(lp350
VBut this is the opportunity that I see.
p351
aVThe concept of global citizenship,
p352
aVself-evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways,
p353
aVhas coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live.
p354
aVWe, as global citizens,
p355
aVnow have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change
p356
aVaround the world.
p357
aVSo in the months and years ahead,
p358
aVglobal citizens will hold world leaders accountable
p359
aVto ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development
p360
aVare tracked and implemented.
p361
aVGlobal citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs
p362
aVto end diseases like polio and malaria.
p363
aVGlobal citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe,
p364
aVincreasing the frequency, quality
p365
aVand impact of their actions.
p366
aVThese dreams are within reach.
p367
aVImagine an army of millions
p368
aVgrowing into tens of millions,
p369
aVconnected, informed, engaged
p370
aVand unwilling to take no for an answer.
p371
aa(lp372
VOver all these years,
p373
aVI've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.
p374
aVSadly, I've been unable to.
p375
aVWe met long before social media,
p376
aVand his address has now been relocated by the authorities,
p377
aVas often happens with slums.
p378
aVI'd love to sit down with him,
p379
aVwherever he is,
p380
aVand share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.
p381
aVThanks to him and so many others,
p382
aVI came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people \u2014
p383
aVthe kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world,
p384
aVthe global citizens.
p385
aVGlobal citizens who stand together,
p386
aVwho ask the question "Why?,"
p387
aVwho reject the naysayers,
p388
aVand embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share.
p389
aa(lp390
VI'm a global citizen.
p391
