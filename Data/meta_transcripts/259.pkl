VWhat I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,
p4
aVand actually all the way down into the sewer
p5
aVbecause I want to talk about diarrhea.
p6
aVAnd in particular, I want to talk about
p7
aVthe design of diarrhea.
p8
aVAnd when evolutionary biologists talk about design,
p9
aVthey really mean design by natural selection.
p10
aVAnd that brings me to the title of the talk,
p11
aV"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."
p12
aVAnd I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.
p13
aVBut I'm not just doing this to be cute.
p14
aVI really think that this subtitle explains
p15
aVwhat somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,
p16
aVhow they actually look at one's role in
p17
aVsort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.
p18
aVIt's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.
p19
aVYou actually see a great potential,
p20
aVbut you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,
p21
aVand may actually be very resistant, when one tries
p22
aVto introduce ideas.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.
p25
aVOne is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?
p26
aVAnd a very closely related question, which is,
p27
aVhow can we take control of this situation once we understand
p28
aVthe answer to the first question?
p29
aVHow can we make the harmful organisms more mild?
p30
aVAnd I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,
p31
aVabout diarrheal disease organisms.
p32
aVAnd the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,
p33
aVas well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms
p34
aVthat cause acute infectious disease,
p35
aVis to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,
p36
aVgerm's-eye view.
p37
aVAnd in particular, to think about a fundamental idea
p38
aVwhich I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation
p39
aVin the harmfulness of disease organisms.
p40
aVAnd that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,
p41
aVdisease organisms have to get from one host to another,
p42
aVand often they have to rely on the well-being of the host
p43
aVto move them to another host.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut not always.
p46
aVSometimes, you get disease organisms
p47
aVthat don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.
p48
aVAnd when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us
p49
aVthat natural selection will favor the more exploitative,
p50
aVmore predator-like organisms.
p51
aVSo, natural selection will favor organisms
p52
aVthat are more likely to cause damage.
p53
aVIf instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,
p54
aVthen we expect that the winners of the competition
p55
aVwill be the milder organisms.
p56
aVSo, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,
p57
aVand actual selection favors pathogens
p58
aVthat take advantage of those hosts,
p59
aVthe winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts
p60
aVfor their own reproductive success.
p61
aVBut if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,
p62
aVthen it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
p65
aVDiarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.
p66
aVThey can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,
p67
aVperson-to-food-then-to-person contact,
p68
aVwhen somebody eats contaminated food,
p69
aVor they can be transmitted through the water.
p70
aVAnd when they're transmitted through the water,
p71
aVunlike the first two modes of transmission,
p72
aVthese pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.
p73
aVA person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds
p74
aVof other individuals.
p75
aVTo sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that
p76
aVif you've got a sick person in bed,
p77
aVsomebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.
p78
aVThey're going to wash those contaminated materials,
p79
aVand then the water may move into sources of drinking water.
p80
aVPeople will come in to those places where you've got
p81
aVcontaminated drinking water,
p82
aVbring things back to the family,
p83
aVmay drink right at that point.
p84
aVThe whole point is that a person who can't move
p85
aVcan still infect many other individuals.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd so, the theory tells us that
p88
aVwhen diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,
p89
aVwe expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
p90
aVAnd you can test these ideas.
p91
aVSo, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,
p92
aVand see whether or not the ones that tend to be
p93
aVmore transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.
p94
aVAnd the answer is \u2014 yep, they are.
p95
aVNow I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,
p96
aVbut the main point here is that \u2014
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVthere's a lot of them here, I can tell \u2014
p99
aVthe main point here is that those data points
p100
aVall show a very strong, positive association between
p101
aVthe degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,
p102
aVand how harmful they are,
p103
aVhow much death they cause per untreated infection.
p104
aVSo this suggests we're on the right track.
p105
aVBut this, to me, suggests that we really need
p106
aVto ask some additional questions.
p107
aa(lp108
VRemember the second question that I raised at the outset was,
p109
aVhow can we use this knowledge
p110
aVto make disease organisms evolve to be mild?
p111
aVNow, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,
p112
aVyou could cause disease organisms to shift from
p113
aVthe right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.
p114
aVBut it doesn't tell you how long.
p115
aVI mean, if this would require thousands of years,
p116
aVthen it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.
p117
aVBut if it could occur in just a few years,
p118
aVthen it might be a very important way to control
p119
aVsome of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.
p120
aVIn other words, this suggests that we could
p121
aVdomesticate these organisms.
p122
aVWe could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,
p125
aVwhich is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.
p126
aVAnd that is the species of organism that is responsible
p127
aVfor causing cholera.
p128
aVAnd the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at
p129
aVis that we understand why it's so harmful.
p130
aVIt's harmful because it produces a toxin,
p131
aVand that toxin is released when the organism
p132
aVgets into our intestinal tract.
p133
aVIt causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine
p134
aVinto the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,
p135
aVand then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
p136
aVAnd it flushes out thousands of different other competitors
p137
aVthat would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo what happens, if you've got an organism,
p140
aVit produces a lot of toxin.
p141
aVAfter a few days of infection you end up having \u2014
p142
aVthe fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.
p143
aVIt's sort of cloudy water.
p144
aVAnd if you took a drop of that water,
p145
aVyou might find a million diarrheal organisms.
p146
aVIf the organism produced a lot of toxin,
p147
aVyou might find 10 million, or 100 million.
p148
aVIf it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,
p149
aVthen you might find a smaller number.
p150
aVSo the task is to try to figure out
p151
aVhow to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this
p152
aVto evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,
p153
aVthereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted
p154
aVby person-to-person contact,
p155
aVor person-food-person contact \u2014
p156
aVboth of which would really require that people be
p157
aVmobile and fairly healthy for transmission.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, I can think of some possible experiments.
p160
aVOne would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism \u2014
p161
aVsome that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little \u2014
p162
aVand take those strains and spew them out in different countries.
p163
aVSome countries that might have clean water supplies,
p164
aVso that you can't get waterborne transmission:
p165
aVyou expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.
p166
aVOther countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,
p167
aVthere you expect these organisms to evolve
p168
aVtowards a high level of harmfulness, right?
p169
aVThere's a little ethical problem in this experiment.
p170
aVI was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.
p171
aVThat makes me worry a little bit.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VBut anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.
p176
aVAnd this ethical problem's a big problem.
p177
aVJust to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.
p178
aVHere's a girl who's almost dead.
p179
aVShe got rehydration therapy, she perked up,
p180
aVwithin a few days she was looking like a completely different person.
p181
aVSo, we don't want to run an experiment like that.
p182
aVBut interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.
p183
aVIn 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,
p184
aVand within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.
p185
aVNow, I don't know how that happened,
p186
aVand I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.
p187
aVI don't think anybody knows,
p188
aVbut I'm not averse to, once that's happened,
p189
aVto see whether or not the prediction that we would make,
p190
aVthat I did make before, actually holds up.
p191
aVDid the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,
p192
aVwhich has some of the most well protected water supplies
p193
aVin Latin America?
p194
aVAnd did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,
p195
aVwhich has some of the least well protected?
p196
aVAnd Peru's got something sort of in between.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,
p199
aVI got a lot of strains from these different countries
p200
aVand we measured their toxin production in the lab.
p201
aVAnd we found that in Chile \u2014 within two months of the invasion of Peru
p202
aVyou had strains entering Chile \u2014
p203
aVand when you look at those strains,
p204
aVin the very far left-hand side of this graph,
p205
aVyou see a lot of variation in the toxin production.
p206
aVEach dot corresponds to an islet from a different person \u2014
p207
aVa lot of variation on which natural selection can act.
p208
aVBut the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,
p209
aVwithin a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.
p210
aVThey evolved to produce less toxin.
p211
aVAnd to just give you a sense of how important this might be,
p212
aVif we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,
p213
aVon average, reported from Chile every two years.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, it's controlled.
p216
aVThat's how much we have in America,
p217
aVcholera that's acquired endemically,
p218
aVand we don't think we've got a problem here.
p219
aVThey didn't \u2014 they solved the problem in Chile.
p220
aVBut, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,
p221
aVand make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.
p222
aVWell, in Peru it didn't.
p223
aVAnd in Ecuador \u2014 remember, this is the place where it has
p224
aVthe highest potential waterborne transmission \u2014
p225
aVit looked like it got more harmful.
p226
aVIn every case there's a lot of variation,
p227
aVbut something about the environment the people are living in,
p228
aVand I think the only realistic explanation is that it's
p229
aVthe degree of waterborne transmission,
p230
aVfavored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo, this is very encouraging,
p233
aVit suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,
p234
aVif we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.
p235
aVIt would make these organisms evolve to mildness,
p236
aVso that even though people might be getting infected,
p237
aVthey'd be infected with mild strains.
p238
aVIt wouldn't be causing severe disease.
p239
aVBut there's another really interesting aspect of this,
p240
aVand this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,
p241
aVevolution of harmfulness,
p242
aVthen you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
p243
aVAnd the idea is very simple.
p244
aVIf you've got a harmful organism,
p245
aVa high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,
p246
aVa high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.
p247
aVYou've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,
p248
aVso you get increased virulence leading to
p249
aVthe evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.
p250
aVAnd once you get increased antibiotic resistance,
p251
aVthe antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.
p252
aVSo, you've got a higher level of virulence.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, you get this vicious cycle.
p255
aVThe goal is to turn this around.
p256
aVIf you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence
p257
aVby cleaning up the water supply,
p258
aVyou should be able to get an evolutionary decrease
p259
aVin antibiotic resistance.
p260
aVSo, we can go to the same countries and look and see.
p261
aVDid Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,
p262
aVwhereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?
p263
aVIf we look in the beginning of the 1990s,
p264
aVwe see, again, a lot of variation.
p265
aVIn this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity \u2014
p266
aVand I won't go into that.
p267
aVBut we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,
p268
aVPeru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.
p269
aVBut if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,
p270
aVwe see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.
p271
aVAntibiotic sensitivity was going down.
p272
aVAnd in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.
p275
aVThey got the organism to evolve to mildness,
p276
aVand they got no development of antibiotic resistance.
p277
aVNow, these ideas should apply across the board,
p278
aVas long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.
p279
aVAnd I want to give you just one more example,
p280
aVbecause we've talked a little bit about malaria.
p281
aVAnd the example I want to deal with is,
p282
aVor the idea I want to deal with, the question is,
p283
aVwhat can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?
p284
aVNow, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,
p285
aVand normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,
p286
aVit makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd you can show, just by looking at data from literature,
p289
aVthat vector-borne diseases are more harmful
p290
aVthan non-vector-borne diseases.
p291
aVBut I think there's a really fascinating example
p292
aVof what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.
p293
aVIn the case of waterborne transmission,
p294
aVwe'd like to clean up the water supplies,
p295
aVsee whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.
p296
aVIn the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.
p297
aVAnd the logic's a little more subtle here.
p298
aVIf you mosquito-proof houses,
p299
aVwhen people get sick, they're sitting in bed \u2014
p300
aVor in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed \u2014
p301
aVand the mosquitoes can't get to them.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo, if you're a harmful variant
p304
aVin a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.
p305
aVThe only pathogens that get transmitted
p306
aVare the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough
p307
aVto walk outside and get mosquito bites.
p308
aVSo, if you were to mosquito proof houses,
p309
aVyou should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.
p310
aVAnd there's a really wonderful experiment that was done
p311
aVthat suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.
p312
aVAnd that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.
p313
aVJust to give you a little perspective on this,
p314
aVI've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,
p315
aVwhich is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.
p316
aVAnd this really cool experiment was done
p317
aVabout 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,
p318
aVby the Tennessee Valley Authority.
p319
aVThey had dammed up the Tennessee River.
p320
aVThey'd caused the water to back up,
p321
aVthey needed electric, hydroelectric power.
p322
aVAnd when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.
p323
aVThey found in the late '30s \u2014 10 years after they'd made these dams \u2014
p324
aVthat the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,
p325
aVabout a third to half of them were infected with malaria.
p326
aa(lp327
VThis shows you the positions of some of these dams.
p328
aVOK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.
p329
aVThere wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?
p330
aVWell, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.
p331
aVSo they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,
p332
aVand within three years, about 100 dollars per house,
p333
aVthey mosquito proofed every house.
p334
aVAnd these are the data.
p335
aVEvery row across here represents one of those 11 zones.
p336
aVAnd the asterisks represent the time at which
p337
aVthe mosquito proofing was complete.
p338
aVAnd so what you can see is that
p339
aVjust the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,
p340
aVcaused the eradication of malaria.
p341
aVAnd this was, incidentally, published in 1949,
p342
aVin the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
p343
aVBut almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
p344
aVThis is important,
p345
aVbecause it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,
p346
aVyou can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.
p347
aa(lp348
VNow, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.
p349
aVLike, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,
p350
aVsub-Saharan Africa.
p351
aVBut as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,
p352
aVyou're certainly not going to eradicate.
p353
aVBut that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.
p354
aVSo to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,
p355
aVand if it confirms the prediction, then
p356
aVwe should have a very powerful tool.
p357
aVIn a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,
p358
aVbecause most of what's being done today is
p359
aVto rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.
p360
aVAnd we know that, although it's great to make those
p361
aVanti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,
p362
aVwe know that when you make them highly available
p363
aVyou're going to get resistance to those drugs.
p364
aVAnd so it's a short-term solution.
p365
aVThis is a long-term solution.
p366
aa(lp367
VWhat I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution
p368
aVworking in the direction we want it to go,
p369
aVrather than always having to battle evolution as a problem
p370
aVthat stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,
p371
aVfor example with anti-malarial drugs.
p372
aVSo, this table I've given just to emphasize
p373
aVthat I've only talked about two examples.
p374
aVBut as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board
p375
aVfor infectious diseases, and it ought to.
p376
aVBecause when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.
p377
aVWe're dealing with living systems;
p378
aVwe're dealing with systems that evolve.
p379
aVAnd so if you do something with those systems,
p380
aVthey're going to evolve one way or another.
p381
aVAnd all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,
p382
aVso that \u2014 we need to adjust our interventions
p383
aVto get the most bang for the intervention buck,
p384
aVso that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo, I don't really have time to talk about those things,
p387
aVbut I did want to put them up there,
p388
aVjust to give you a sense that there really are solutions
p389
aVto controlling the evolution of harmfulness
p390
aVof some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.
p391
aVAnd this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.
p392
aVSo, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,
p393
aVhow do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?
p394
aVWhat this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.
p395
aVWill it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?
p396
aVIt may get lowered if we intervene in ways that
p397
aVencourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.
p398
aa(lp399
VBut the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,
p400
aVbecause if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.
p401
aVAnd the data really do support this:
p402
aVthat you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.
p403
aVAnd that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.
p404
aVSo the other thing I really like about this,
p405
aVbesides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension
p406
aVinto the study of control of disease,
p407
aVis that often the kinds of interventions that you want,
p408
aVthat it indicates should be done,
p409
aVare the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.
