VIn the last 50 years,
p4
aVwe've been building the suburbs
p5
aVwith a lot of unintended consequences.
p6
aVAnd I'm going to talk about some of those consequences
p7
aVand just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects
p8
aVthat I think give us tremendous reasons
p9
aVto be really optimistic
p10
aVthat the big design and development project of the next 50 years
p11
aVis going to be retrofitting suburbia.
p12
aVSo whether it's redeveloping dying malls
p13
aVor re-inhabiting dead big-box stores
p14
aVor reconstructing wetlands
p15
aVout of parking lots,
p16
aVI think the fact is
p17
aVthe growing number
p18
aVof empty and under-performing,
p19
aVespecially retail, sites
p20
aVthroughout suburbia
p21
aVgives us actually a tremendous opportunity
p22
aVto take our least-sustainable
p23
aVlandscapes right now
p24
aVand convert them into
p25
aVmore sustainable places.
p26
aVAnd in the process, what that allows us to do
p27
aVis to redirect a lot more of our growth
p28
aVback into existing communities
p29
aVthat could use a boost,
p30
aVand have the infrastructure in place,
p31
aVinstead of continuing
p32
aVto tear down trees
p33
aVand to tear up the green space out at the edges.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo why is this important?
p36
aVI think there are any number of reasons,
p37
aVand I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
p38
aVJust from the perspective of climate change,
p39
aVthe average urban dweller in the U.S.
p40
aVhas about one-third the carbon footprint
p41
aVof the average suburban dweller,
p42
aVmostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,
p43
aVand living in detached buildings,
p44
aVyou have that much more exterior surface
p45
aVto leak energy out of.
p46
aVSo strictly from
p47
aVa climate change perspective,
p48
aVthe cities are already
p49
aVrelatively green.
p50
aVThe big opportunity
p51
aVto reduce greenhouse gas emissions
p52
aVis actually in urbanizing
p53
aVthe suburbs.
p54
aVAll that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,
p55
aVwe have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
p56
aVIt's increased our dependence
p57
aVon foreign oil
p58
aVdespite the gains in fuel efficiency.
p59
aVWe're just driving so much more;
p60
aVwe haven't been able to keep up technologically.
p61
aa(lp62
VPublic health is another reason
p63
aVto consider retrofitting.
p64
aVResearchers at the CDC and other places
p65
aVhave increasingly been linking
p66
aVsuburban development patterns
p67
aVwith sedentary lifestyles.
p68
aVAnd those have been linked then
p69
aVwith the rather alarming,
p70
aVgrowing rates of obesity,
p71
aVshown in these maps here,
p72
aVand that obesity has also been triggering
p73
aVgreat increases in heart disease
p74
aVand diabetes
p75
aVto the point where a child born today
p76
aVhas a one-in-three chance
p77
aVof developing diabetes.
p78
aVAnd that rate has been escalating at the same rate
p79
aVas children not walking
p80
aVto school anymore,
p81
aVagain, because of our development patterns.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd then there's finally \u2014 there's the affordability question.
p84
aVI mean, how affordable is it
p85
aVto continue to live in suburbia
p86
aVwith rising gas prices?
p87
aVSuburban expansion to cheap land,
p88
aVfor the last 50 years \u2014
p89
aVyou know the cheap land out on the edge \u2014
p90
aVhas helped generations of families
p91
aVenjoy the American dream.
p92
aVBut increasingly,
p93
aVthe savings promised
p94
aVby drive-till-you-qualify affordability \u2014
p95
aVwhich is basically our model \u2014
p96
aVthose savings are wiped out
p97
aVwhen you consider the transportation costs.
p98
aVFor instance, here in Atlanta,
p99
aVabout half of households
p100
aVmake between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,
p101
aVand they are spending 29 percent of their income
p102
aVon housing
p103
aVand 32 percent
p104
aVon transportation.
p105
aVI mean, that's 2005 figures.
p106
aVThat's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
p107
aVYou know, none of us
p108
aVreally tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
p109
aVand they're not going down
p110
aVany time soon.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhether you love suburbia's leafy privacy
p113
aVor you hate its soulless commercial strips,
p114
aVthere are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
p115
aVBut is it practical?
p116
aVI think it is.
p117
aVJune Williamson and I have been researching this topic
p118
aVfor over a decade,
p119
aVand we've found over 80
p120
aVvaried projects.
p121
aVBut that they're really all market driven,
p122
aVand what's driving the market in particular \u2014
p123
aVnumber one \u2014 is major demographic shifts.
p124
aVWe all tend to think of suburbia
p125
aVas this very family-focused place,
p126
aVbut that's really not the case anymore.
p127
aVSince 2000,
p128
aValready two-thirds of households in suburbia
p129
aVdid not have kids in them.
p130
aVWe just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
p131
aVThe reasons for this have a lot to with
p132
aVthe dominance of the two big
p133
aVdemographic groups right now:
p134
aVthe Baby Boomers retiring \u2014
p135
aVand then there's a gap,
p136
aVGeneration X, which is a small generation.
p137
aVThey're still having kids \u2014
p138
aVbut Generation Y hasn't even started
p139
aVhitting child-rearing age.
p140
aVThey're the other big generation.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo as a result of that,
p143
aVdemographers predict
p144
aVthat through 2025,
p145
aV75 to 85 percent of new households
p146
aVwill not have kids in them.
p147
aVAnd the market research, consumer research,
p148
aVasking the Boomers and Gen Y
p149
aVwhat it is they would like,
p150
aVwhat they would like to live in,
p151
aVtells us there is going to be a huge demand \u2014
p152
aVand we're already seeing it \u2014
p153
aVfor more urban lifestyles
p154
aVwithin suburbia.
p155
aVThat basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,
p156
aVand Gen Y would like to live
p157
aVan urban lifestyle,
p158
aVbut most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe other big dynamic of change
p161
aVis the sheer performance of
p162
aVunderperforming asphalt.
p163
aVNow I keep thinking this would be a great name
p164
aVfor an indie rock band,
p165
aVbut developers generally use it
p166
aVto refer to underused parking lots \u2014
p167
aVand suburbia is full of them.
p168
aVWhen the postwar suburbs were first built
p169
aVout on the cheap land
p170
aVaway from downtown,
p171
aVit made sense to just build
p172
aVsurface parking lots.
p173
aVBut those sites have now been leapfrogged
p174
aVand leapfrogged again,
p175
aVas we've just continued to sprawl,
p176
aVand they now have
p177
aVa relatively central location.
p178
aVIt no longer just makes sense.
p179
aVThat land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
p180
aVIt now makes sense to go back in,
p181
aVbuild a deck and build up
p182
aVon those sites.
p183
aVSo what do you do
p184
aVwith a dead mall,
p185
aVdead office park?
p186
aVIt turns out, all sorts of things.
p187
aVIn a slow economy like ours,
p188
aVre-inhabitation is
p189
aVone of the more popular strategies.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo this happens to be
p192
aVa dead mall in St. Louis
p193
aVthat's been re-inhabited as art-space.
p194
aVIt's now home to artist studios,
p195
aVtheater groups, dance troupes.
p196
aVIt's not pulling in as much tax revenue
p197
aVas it once was,
p198
aVbut it's serving its community.
p199
aVIt's keeping the lights on.
p200
aVIt's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
p201
aVOther malls have been re-inhabited
p202
aVas nursing homes,
p203
aVas universities,
p204
aVand as all variety of office space.
p205
aVWe also found a lot of examples
p206
aVof dead big-box stores
p207
aVthat have been converted into
p208
aVall sorts of community-serving uses as well \u2014
p209
aVlots of schools, lots of churches
p210
aVand lots of libraries like this one.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,
p213
aVthat is now a public library.
p214
aVIn addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,
p215
aVthey tore up some of the parking spaces,
p216
aVput in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,
p217
aVput in a lot more sidewalks
p218
aVto connect to the neighborhoods.
p219
aVAnd they've made this,
p220
aVwhat was just a store along a commercial strip,
p221
aVinto a community gathering space.
p222
aVThis one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center
p223
aVin Phoenix, Arizona.
p224
aVReally all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,
p225
aVa gourmet grocery,
p226
aVand they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
p227
aVNever underestimate the power of food
p228
aVto turn a place around
p229
aVand make it a destination.
p230
aVIt's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
p231
aVThe real estate ads in the neighborhood
p232
aVall very proudly proclaim,
p233
aV"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"
p234
aVbecause it provided its neighborhood
p235
aVwith what sociologists like to call
p236
aV"a third place."
p237
aVIf home is the first place
p238
aVand work is the second place,
p239
aVthe third place is where you go to hang out
p240
aVand build community.
p241
aVAnd especially as suburbia is becoming
p242
aVless centered on the family,
p243
aVthe family households,
p244
aVthere's a real hunger
p245
aVfor more third places.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo the most dramatic retrofits
p248
aVare really those in the next category,
p249
aVthe next strategy: redevelopment.
p250
aVNow, during the boom, there were several
p251
aVreally dramatic redevelopment projects
p252
aVwhere the original building
p253
aVwas scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt
p254
aVat significantly greater density,
p255
aVa sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
p256
aVBut some of them have been much more incremental.
p257
aVThis is Mashpee Commons,
p258
aVthe oldest retrofit that we've found.
p259
aVAnd it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,
p260
aVbuilt urbanism
p261
aVon top of its parking lots.
p262
aVSo the black and white photo shows
p263
aVthe simple 60's strip shopping center.
p264
aVAnd then the maps above that
p265
aVshow its gradual transformation
p266
aVinto a compact,
p267
aVmixed-use New England village,
p268
aVand it has plans now that have been approved
p269
aVfor it to connect
p270
aVto new residential neighborhoods
p271
aVacross the arterials
p272
aVand over to the other side.
p273
aVSo, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
p274
aVSometimes, it's all at once.
p275
aa(lp276
VThis is another infill project on the parking lots,
p277
aVthis one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
p278
aVWhen Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs
p279
aVand opened a station nearby to this site,
p280
aVthe owners decided
p281
aVto build a new parking deck
p282
aVand then insert on top of their surface lots
p283
aVa new Main Street, several apartments
p284
aVand condo buildings,
p285
aVwhile keeping the existing office buildings.
p286
aVHere is the site in 1940:
p287
aVIt was just a little farm
p288
aVin the village of Hyattsville.
p289
aVBy 1980, it had been subdivided
p290
aVinto a big mall on one side
p291
aVand the office park on the other
p292
aVand then some buffer sites for a library
p293
aVand a church to the far right.
p294
aVToday, the transit,
p295
aVthe Main Street and the new housing
p296
aVhave all been built.
p297
aVEventually, I expect that the streets
p298
aVwill probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
p299
aVPlans have already been announced
p300
aVfor a lot of those garden apartments
p301
aVabove the mall to be redeveloped.
p302
aVTransit is a big driver of retrofits.
p303
aVSo here's what it looks like.
p304
aVYou can sort of see the funky new condo buildings
p305
aVin between the office buildings
p306
aVand the public space and the new Main Street.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
p309
aVI think they really built an attractive place here
p310
aVand have just employed all-green construction.
p311
aVThere's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs
p312
aVas well as wind turbines.
p313
aVThis was a very large mall
p314
aVon a hundred-acre superblock.
p315
aVIt's now 22
p316
aVwalkable urban blocks
p317
aVwith public streets,
p318
aVtwo public parks, eight bus lines
p319
aVand a range of housing types,
p320
aVand so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado
p321
aVthe downtown
p322
aVthat this particular suburb never had.
p323
aVHere was the mall in its heyday.
p324
aVThey had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
p325
aVSo here's the site in 1975
p326
aVwith the mall.
p327
aVBy 1995, the mall has died.
p328
aVThe department store has been kept \u2014
p329
aVand we found this was true in many cases.
p330
aVThe department stores are multistory; they're better built.
p331
aVThey're easy to be re-adapted.
p332
aVBut the one story stuff ...
p333
aVthat's really history.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo here it is at projected build-out.
p336
aVThis project, I think, has great connectivity
p337
aVto the existing neighborhoods.
p338
aVIt's providing 1,500 households with the option
p339
aVof a more urban lifestyle.
p340
aVIt's about two-thirds built out right now.
p341
aVHere's what the new Main Street looks like.
p342
aVIt's very successful,
p343
aVand it's helped to prompt \u2014
p344
aVeight of the 13
p345
aVregional malls in Denver
p346
aVhave now, or have announced plans to
p347
aVbe, retrofitted.
p348
aVBut it's important to note that all of this retrofitting
p349
aVis not occurring \u2014
p350
aVjust bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
p351
aVNo, it's pockets of walkability
p352
aVon the sites of
p353
aVunder-performing properties.
p354
aVAnd so it's giving people more choices,
p355
aVbut it's not taking away choices.
p356
aa(lp357
VBut it's also not really enough
p358
aVto just create pockets of walkability.
p359
aVYou want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
p360
aVWe need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
p361
aVSo this is one that has been
p362
aVretrofitted in California.
p363
aVThey took the commercial strip
p364
aVshown on the black-and-white images below,
p365
aVand they built a boulevard
p366
aVthat has become the Main Street for their town.
p367
aVAnd it's transformed from being
p368
aVan ugly, unsafe,
p369
aVundesirable address,
p370
aVto becoming a beautiful,
p371
aVattractive, dignified sort of good address.
p372
aVI mean now we're hoping we start to see it;
p373
aVthey've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
p374
aVI could imagine beautiful housing going up along there
p375
aVwithout tearing down another tree.
p376
aVSo there's a lot of great things,
p377
aVbut I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
p378
aa(lp379
VBut densification
p380
aVis not going to work everywhere.
p381
aVSometimes re-greening
p382
aVis really the better answer.
p383
aVThere's a lot to learn from successful
p384
aVlandbanking programs
p385
aVin cities like Flint, Michigan.
p386
aVThere's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement \u2014
p387
aVsort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
p388
aVBut perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects
p389
aVis the opportunity to restore
p390
aVthe local ecology,
p391
aVas in this example outside of Minneapolis.
p392
aVWhen the shopping center died,
p393
aVthe city restored the site's
p394
aVoriginal wetlands,
p395
aVcreating lakefront property,
p396
aVwhich then attracted private investment,
p397
aVthe first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood
p398
aVin over 40 years.
p399
aVSo they've managed to both restore the local ecology
p400
aVand the local economy at the same time.
p401
aVThis is another re-greening example.
p402
aVIt also makes sense in very strong markets.
p403
aVThis one in Seattle
p404
aVis on the site of a mall parking lot
p405
aVadjacent to a new transit stop.
p406
aVAnd the wavy line
p407
aVis a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
p408
aVThe creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
p409
aVBut daylighting our creeks
p410
aVreally improves their water quality
p411
aVand contributions to habitat.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo I've shown you some of
p414
aVthe first generation of retrofits.
p415
aVWhat's next?
p416
aVI think we have three challenges for the future.
p417
aVThe first is to plan retrofitting
p418
aVmuch more systemically
p419
aVat the metropolitan scale.
p420
aVWe need to be able to target
p421
aVwhich areas really should be re-greened.
p422
aVWhere should we be redeveloping?
p423
aVAnd where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
p424
aVThese slides just show two images
p425
aVfrom a larger project
p426
aVthat looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
p427
aVI led a team that was asked to imagine
p428
aVAtlanta 100 years from now.
p429
aVAnd we chose to try to reverse sprawl
p430
aVthrough three simple moves \u2014 expensive, but simple.
p431
aVOne, in a hundred years,
p432
aVtransit on all major
p433
aVrail and road corridors.
p434
aVTwo, in a hundred years,
p435
aVthousand foot buffers
p436
aVon all stream corridors.
p437
aVIt's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
p438
aVIn a hundred years,
p439
aVsubdivisions that simply end up too close to water
p440
aVor too far from transit won't be viable.
p441
aVAnd so we've created the eco-acre
p442
aVtransfer-to-transfer development rights
p443
aVto the transit corridors
p444
aVand allow the re-greening
p445
aVof those former subdivisions
p446
aVfor food and energy production.
p447
aa(lp448
VSo the second challenge
p449
aVis to improve the architectural design quality
p450
aVof the retrofits.
p451
aVAnd I close with this image
p452
aVof democracy in action:
p453
aVThis is a protest that's happening
p454
aVon a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland
p455
aVon an Astroturf town green.
p456
aVNow, retrofits are often accused
p457
aVof being examples of faux downtowns
p458
aVand instant urbanism,
p459
aVand not without reason; you don't get much more phony
p460
aVthan an Astroturf town green.
p461
aVI have to say, these are very hybrid places.
p462
aVThey are new but trying to look old.
p463
aVThey have urban streetscapes,
p464
aVbut suburban parking ratios.
p465
aVTheir populations are
p466
aVmore diverse than typical suburbia,
p467
aVbut they're less diverse than cities.
p468
aVAnd they are
p469
aVpublic places,
p470
aVbut that are managed by private companies.
p471
aVAnd just the surface appearance
p472
aVare often \u2014 like the Astroturf here \u2014
p473
aVthey make me wince.
p474
aVSo, you know, I mean I'm glad that
p475
aVthe urbanism is doing its job.
p476
aVThe fact that a protest is happening
p477
aVreally does mean
p478
aVthat the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,
p479
aVcompromised as it may be,
p480
aVis still a really great thing.
p481
aVBut we've got to get the architecture better.
p482
aa(lp483
VThe final challenge is for all of you.
p484
aVI want you to join the protest
p485
aVand start demanding
p486
aVmore sustainable suburban places \u2014
p487
aVmore sustainable places, period.
p488
aVBut culturally,
p489
