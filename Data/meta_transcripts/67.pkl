VAs other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience \u2014
p4
aVa particularly daunting experience \u2014 to be speaking in front of this audience.
p5
aVBut unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about
p6
aVthe mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution,
p7
aVor the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking
p8
aVthe major inequalities in our world.
p9
aVOr even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.
p10
aVMy brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics \u2014
p11
aVand, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics.
p12
aVAnd that's \u2014
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aV\u2014 that's rather more challenging
p15
aVthan all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVOne of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession,
p18
aVrather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures
p19
aVbut didn't have the personality skills to become accountants.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAnd there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's,
p22
aV"How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?"
p23
aVTo which the answer is,
p24
aV"The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes."
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVBut I want to tell you something useful \u2014 and here it is, so concentrate now.
p27
aVThis evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.
p28
aVAnd it's a wonderful setting, as I hope you'll find,
p29
aVand a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition.
p30
aVIt's very unlikely \u2014 in this special setting, and this collection of people \u2014
p31
aVbut you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't.
p32
aVSo here's what you do.
p33
aVWhen they say to you, "What do you do?" \u2014 you say, "I'm a statistician."
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVWell, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up.
p36
aVAnd then one of two things will happen.
p37
aVThey'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room
p38
aVand run over and talk to them.
p39
aVOr they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry \u2014 and often both \u2014
p40
aVand sprint off for a drink and some food.
p41
aVAnd you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do.
p44
aVWe're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on.
p45
aVAnd it's something I've never really found a good way of doing.
p46
aVBut my wife \u2014 who was then my girlfriend \u2014
p47
aVmanaged it much better than I've ever been able to.
p48
aVMany years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain,
p49
aVand I was, at that stage, working in America.
p50
aVI was coming back to visit her.
p51
aVShe told this to one of her colleagues, who said, "Well, what does your boyfriend do?"
p52
aVSarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained \u2014
p53
aVand she concentrated, in those days, on listening.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVDon't tell her I said that.
p56
aVAnd she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models
p57
aVfor understanding evolution and modern genetics.
p58
aVSo when her colleague said, "What does he do?"
p59
aVShe paused and said, "He models things."
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVWell, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect
p62
aVand went on and said, "What does he model?"
p63
aVWell, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes."
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aV"He models genes."
p66
aa(lp67
VThat is my first love, and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about.
p68
aVWhat I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about
p69
aVthe place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world,
p70
aVand how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it.
p71
aVSo you've had a pretty easy time up till now \u2014
p72
aVa few laughs, and all that kind of thing \u2014 in the talks to date.
p73
aVYou've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.
p74
aVSo here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you.
p75
aVCan you imagine tossing a coin successively?
p76
aVAnd for some reason \u2014 which shall remain rather vague \u2014
p77
aVwe're interested in a particular pattern.
p78
aVHere's one \u2014 a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo suppose we toss a coin repeatedly.
p81
aVThen the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here.
p82
aVAnd you can count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 \u2014
p83
aVit happens after the 10th toss.
p84
aVSo you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.
p85
aVImagine this half of the audience each get out coins, and they toss them
p86
aVuntil they first see the pattern head-tail-tail.
p87
aVThe first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.
p88
aVThe second time, maybe it's after the fourth toss.
p89
aVThe next time, after the 15th toss.
p90
aVSo you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers.
p91
aVThat's what I want this side to think about.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe other half of the audience doesn't like head-tail-tail \u2014
p94
aVthey think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring \u2014
p95
aVand they're much more interested in a different pattern \u2014 head-tail-head.
p96
aVSo, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.
p97
aVAnd you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears
p98
aVand you average them. OK?
p99
aVSo on this side, you've got a number \u2014
p100
aVyou've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately \u2014
p101
aVwhich is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail.
p102
aVOn this side, you've got a number \u2014 the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo here's a deep mathematical fact \u2014
p105
aVif you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.
p106
aVEither they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one,
p107
aVor this one's bigger than that one.
p108
aVSo what's going on here?
p109
aVSo you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote \u2014
p110
aVand we're not moving on.
p111
aVAnd I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence
p112
aVto give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK.
p113
aVSo what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see
p114
aVhead-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail.
p115
aa(lp116
VWho thinks that A is true \u2014
p117
aVthat, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
p118
aVWho thinks that B is true \u2014 that on average, they're the same?
p119
aVWho thinks that C is true \u2014 that, on average, it'll take less time
p120
aVto see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
p121
aVOK, who hasn't voted yet? Because that's really naughty \u2014 I said you had to.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVOK. So most people think B is true.
p124
aVAnd you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that.
p125
aVIt's not. A is true here.
p126
aVIt takes longer, on average.
p127
aVIn fact, the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10
p128
aVand the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight.
p129
aVHow could that be?
p130
aVAnything different about the two patterns?
p131
aVThere is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.
p132
aVIf you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences
p133
aVof the pattern in only five tosses.
p134
aVYou can't do that with head-tail-tail.
p135
aVThat turns out to be important.
p136
aa(lp137
VThere are two ways of thinking about this.
p138
aVI'll give you one of them.
p139
aVSo imagine \u2014 let's suppose we're doing it.
p140
aVOn this side \u2014 remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail;
p141
aVyou're excited about head-tail-head.
p142
aVWe start tossing a coin, and we get a head \u2014
p143
aVand you start sitting on the edge of your seat
p144
aVbecause something great and wonderful, or awesome, might be about to happen.
p145
aVThe next toss is a tail \u2014 you get really excited.
p146
aVThe champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate.
p147
aVYou're waiting with bated breath for the final toss.
p148
aVAnd if it comes down a head, that's great.
p149
aVYou're done, and you celebrate.
p150
aVIf it's a tail \u2014 well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away
p151
aVand put the champagne back.
p152
aVAnd you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.
p153
aa(lp154
VOn this side, there's a different experience.
p155
aVIt's the same for the first two parts of the sequence.
p156
aVYou're a little bit excited with the first head \u2014
p157
aVyou get rather more excited with the next tail.
p158
aVThen you toss the coin.
p159
aVIf it's a tail, you crack open the champagne.
p160
aVIf it's a head you're disappointed,
p161
aVbut you're still a third of the way to your pattern again.
p162
aVAnd that's an informal way of presenting it \u2014 that's why there's a difference.
p163
aVAnother way of thinking about it \u2014
p164
aVif we tossed a coin eight million times,
p165
aVthen we'd expect a million head-tail-heads
p166
aVand a million head-tail-tails \u2014 but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.
p167
aVSo if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions
p168
aVand you can have some of them overlapping, the clumps will be further apart.
p169
aVIt's another way of getting the intuition.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat's the point I want to make?
p172
aVIt's a very, very simple example, an easily stated question in probability,
p173
aVwhich every \u2014 you're in good company \u2014 everybody gets wrong.
p174
aVThis is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics.
p175
aVThere's a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics,
p176
aVand it's the following.
p177
aVWhen you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails.
p178
aVWhen you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things \u2014 heads and tails \u2014
p179
aVbut four letters \u2014 As, Gs, Cs and Ts.
p180
aVAnd there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes
p181
aVwhich cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns.
p182
aVAnd they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology.
p183
aVAnd instead of asking the question, "How long until I see a head-tail-head?" \u2014
p184
aVyou can ask, "How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme
p185
aVwhich cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example?
p186
aVHow long will those chunks be?"
p187
aa(lp188
VThat's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics.
p189
aVThere's a much deeper connection, which I don't have time to go into
p190
aVand that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science.
p191
aVAnd we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that.
p192
aVBut it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern
p193
aVexperimental technologies, a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated \u2014
p194
aVyou'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job,
p195
aVrather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story \u2014
p196
aVbut quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings
p197
aVand modern statistical techniques.
p198
aVAnd I will give you two little snippets \u2014 two examples \u2014
p199
aVof projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford,
p200
aVboth of which I think are rather exciting.
p201
aVYou know about the Human Genome Project.
p202
aVThat was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome.
p203
aVThe natural thing to do after you've done that \u2014
p204
aVand that's what this project, the International HapMap Project,
p205
aVwhich is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.
p206
aVThink of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common,
p207
aVand the HapMap Project is trying to understand
p208
aVwhere there are differences between different people.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhy do we care about that?
p211
aVWell, there are lots of reasons.
p212
aVThe most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences
p213
aVmake some people susceptible to one disease \u2014 type-2 diabetes, for example \u2014
p214
aVand other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease,
p215
aVor stroke, or autism and so on.
p216
aVThat's one big project.
p217
aVThere's a second big project,
p218
aVrecently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country,
p219
aVinvolving very large studies \u2014
p220
aVthousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases,
p221
aVcommon diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,
p222
aVbipolar disease and so on \u2014 to try and understand the genetics.
p223
aVTo try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases.
p224
aVWhy do we want to do that?
p225
aVBecause we understand very little about most human diseases.
p226
aVWe don't know what causes them.
p227
aVAnd if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics,
p228
aVwe'll have a window on the way the disease works,
p229
aVand a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies
p230
aVand preventative treatment and so on.
p231
aVSo that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.
p232
aa(lp233
VBack to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty.
p234
aVHere's another quiz for you \u2014
p235
aVnow suppose we've got a test for a disease
p236
aVwhich isn't infallible, but it's pretty good.
p237
aVIt gets it right 99 percent of the time.
p238
aVAnd I take one of you, or I take someone off the street,
p239
aVand I test them for the disease in question.
p240
aVLet's suppose there's a test for HIV \u2014 the virus that causes AIDS \u2014
p241
aVand the test says the person has the disease.
p242
aVWhat's the chance that they do?
p243
aVThe test gets it right 99 percent of the time.
p244
aVSo a natural answer is 99 percent.
p245
aVWho likes that answer?
p246
aVCome on \u2014 everyone's got to get involved.
p247
aVDon't think you don't trust me anymore.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVWell, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.
p250
aVThat's what you might think.
p251
aVIt's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.
p252
aVIt actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.
p253
aVSo let me try and illustrate that.
p254
aVHere's a little caricature of a million individuals.
p255
aVSo let's think about a disease that affects \u2014
p256
aVit's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.
p257
aVAmongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy
p258
aVand some of them will have the disease.
p259
aVAnd in fact, if this is the prevalence of the disease,
p260
aVabout 100 will have the disease and the rest won't.
p261
aVSo now suppose we test them all.
p262
aVWhat happens?
p263
aVWell, amongst the 100 who do have the disease,
p264
aVthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive.
p265
aVAmongst all these other people who don't have the disease,
p266
aVthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time.
p267
aVIt'll only get it wrong one percent of the time.
p268
aVBut there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives.
p269
aVPut that another way \u2014
p270
aVof all of them who test positive \u2014 so here they are, the individuals involved \u2014
p271
aVless than one in 100 actually have the disease.
p272
aVSo even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is
p273
aVthere's another bit of information we need.
p274
aa(lp275
VHere's the key intuition.
p276
aVWhat we have to do, once we know the test is positive,
p277
aVis to weigh up the plausibility, or the likelihood, of two competing explanations.
p278
aVEach of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit.
p279
aVOne explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease \u2014
p280
aVthat's overwhelmingly likely, if you pick someone at random \u2014
p281
aVbut the test gets it wrong, which is unlikely.
p282
aVThe other explanation is that the person does have the disease \u2014 that's unlikely \u2014
p283
aVbut the test gets it right, which is likely.
p284
aVAnd the number we end up with \u2014
p285
aVthat number which is a little bit less than one in 100 \u2014
p286
aVis to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other.
p287
aVEach of them taken together is unlikely.
p288
aa(lp289
VHere's a more topical example of exactly the same thing.
p290
aVThose of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case
p291
aVof a woman called Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly.
p292
aVAnd initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as "cot death,"
p293
aVand more formally as "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."
p294
aVFor various reasons, she was later charged with murder.
p295
aVAnd at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence
p296
aVthat the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers \u2014
p297
aVwhich was professional and non-smoking \u2014 was one in 73 million.
p298
aVTo cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time.
p299
aVLater, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal \u2014 in fact, on the second appeal.
p300
aVAnd just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone
p301
aVto have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent,
p302
aVto be convicted of murdering them.
p303
aVTo be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them \u2014
p304
aVand to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners
p305
aVthink you killed your children \u2014 is a really awful thing to happen to someone.
p306
aVAnd it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics
p307
aVhorribly wrong, in two different ways.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo where did he get the one in 73 million number?
p310
aVHe looked at some research, which said the chance of one cot death in a family
p311
aVlike Sally Clark's is about one in 8,500.
p312
aVSo he said, "I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family,
p313
aVthe chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed."
p314
aVSo that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence.
p315
aVIt's like saying, "If you toss a coin and get a head the first time,
p316
aVthat won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time."
p317
aVSo if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half \u2014
p318
aVthat's the chance the first time \u2014 times a half \u2014 the chance a second time.
p319
aVSo he said, "Here,
p320
aVI'll assume that these events are independent.
p321
aVWhen you multiply 8,500 together twice,
p322
aVyou get about 73 million."
p323
aVAnd none of this was stated to the court as an assumption
p324
aVor presented to the jury that way.
p325
aVUnfortunately here \u2014 and, really, regrettably \u2014
p326
aVfirst of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically.
p327
aVAnd secondly, it's palpably false.
p328
aVThere are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths.
p329
aVIt might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of,
p330
aVand it's pretty likely to be the case that there are
p331
aVgenetic factors we're not aware of.
p332
aVSo if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group.
p333
aVThey've probably got these environmental risk factors
p334
aVand/or genetic risk factors we don't know about.
p335
aVAnd to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know
p336
aVthat information is really silly.
p337
aVIt's worse than silly \u2014 it's really bad science.
p338
aVNonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it.
p339
aVThat's the first problem.
p340
aVThe second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean?
p341
aVSo after Sally Clark was convicted \u2014
p342
aVyou can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press \u2014
p343
aVone of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that
p344
aVwhat the expert had said was,
p345
aV"The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million."
p346
aVNow, that's a logical error.
p347
aVIt's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that
p348
aVafter the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate,
p349
aVthe chance of having the disease is 99 percent.
p350
aVIn the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things,
p351
aVone of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not.
p352
aVAnd the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not.
p353
aVIt's exactly the same in this context.
p354
aVThere are two things involved \u2014 two parts to the explanation.
p355
aVWe want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are.
p356
aVOne of them is that Sally Clark was innocent \u2014
p357
aVwhich is, a priori, overwhelmingly likely \u2014
p358
aVmost mothers don't kill their children.
p359
aVAnd the second part of the explanation
p360
aVis that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event.
p361
aVNot as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely.
p362
aVThe other explanation is that she was guilty.
p363
aVNow, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.
p364
aVAnd we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial
p365
aVthat that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.
p366
aVAnd then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.
p367
aVSo the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.
p368
aVWe don't know what it is.
p369
aVIt has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her
p370
aVand the statistical evidence.
p371
aVWe know the children died.
p372
aVWhat matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other,
p373
aVthe two explanations are.
p374
aVAnd they're both implausible.
p375
aVThere's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound
p376
aVand really unfortunate consequences.
p377
aVIn fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the
p378
aVevidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal.
p379
aVMany cases were reviewed.
p380
aVAnd it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge
p381
aVat Britain's General Medical Council.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo just to conclude \u2014 what are the take-home messages from this?
p384
aVWell, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance
p385
aVare very much a part of our everyday life.
p386
aVIt's also true \u2014 and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways,
p387
aVyou're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right.
p388
aVIt's very well documented that people get things wrong.
p389
aVThey make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty.
p390
aVWe can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly \u2014
p391
aVand there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.
p392
aVWe are not good at reasoning with uncertainty.
p393
aVThat's an issue in our everyday lives.
p394
aVAs you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount
p395
aVof research in science \u2014 in social science, in medicine
p396
aVand indeed, quite a lot of industry.
p397
aVAll of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing,
p398
aVis underpinned by statistics.
p399
aVIt's something we're bad at doing.
p400
aVAt the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to.
p401
aVTo go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial
p402
aVall of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said.
p403
aVSo if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury,
p404
aV"I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road.
p405
aVPlease drive your car home over it,"
p406
aVthey would have said, "Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.
p407
aVThat's what engineers do."
p408
aVOn the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied,
p409
aV"I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics."
p410
aVAnd everyone said, "Well, that's fine. He's an expert."
p411
aVSo we need to understand where our competence is and isn't.
p412
aVExactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling,
p413
aVwhen scientists, and lawyers and in some cases judges,
p414
aVroutinely misrepresented evidence.
p415
aVUsually \u2014 one hopes \u2014 innocently, but misrepresented evidence.
p416
aVForensic scientists said, "The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million."
p417
aVEven if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one,
p418
aVthat's not what it meant.
p419
aVAnd there have been celebrated appeal cases
p420
aVin Britain and elsewhere because of that.
p421
aa(lp422
VAnd just to finish in the context of the legal system.
p423
aVIt's all very well to say, "Let's do our best to present the evidence."
p424
aVBut more and more, in cases of DNA profiling \u2014 this is another one \u2014
p425
aVwe expect juries, who are ordinary people \u2014
p426
aVand it's documented they're very bad at this \u2014
p427
aVwe expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on.
p428
aVIn other spheres of life, if people argued \u2014 well, except possibly for politics \u2014
p429
aVbut in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically,
p430
aVwe'd say that's not a good thing.
p431
aVWe sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more.
p432
aVIn the case of uncertainty, we get it wrong all the time \u2014
p433
aVand at the very least, we should be aware of that,
p434
aVand ideally, we might try and do something about it.
p435
aVThanks very much.
