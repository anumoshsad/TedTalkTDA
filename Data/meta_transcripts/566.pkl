VThis is a world-changing invention.
p4
aVThe smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands
p5
aVof lives, worldwide.
p6
aVBut smoke alarms don't prevent fires.
p7
aa(lp8
VEvery year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured
p9
aVwith 350,000 home fires.
p10
aVAnd one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.
p11
aVWhat if we could prevent electrical fires
p12
aVbefore they start?
p13
aVWell, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo how does electricity ignite residential fires?
p16
aVWell it turns out that the main causes
p17
aVare faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.
p18
aVOur invention had to address all of these issues.
p19
aVSo what about circuit breakers?
p20
aVWell, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.
p21
aVThis is 130-year-old technology,
p22
aVand this is a problem, because over 80 percent
p23
aVof all home electrical fires
p24
aVstart below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.
p25
aVHmmm ...
p26
aa(lp27
VSo we considered all of this. And we realized
p28
aVthat electrical appliances
p29
aVmust be able to communicate directly
p30
aVwith the power receptacle itself.
p31
aVAny electrical device \u2014 an appliance, an extension cord, whatever \u2014
p32
aVmust be able to tell the power outlet,
p33
aV"Hey, power outlet,
p34
aVI'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire."
p35
aVAnd the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.
p36
aVSo here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,
p37
aVa data tag, in the appliance plug.
p38
aVAnd we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle
p39
aVso they could communicate.
p40
aVNow, every home electrical system
p41
aVbecomes an intelligent network.
p42
aVThe appliance's safe operating parameters
p43
aVare embedded into its plug.
p44
aVIf too much current is flowing,
p45
aVthe intelligent receptacle turns itself off,
p46
aVand prevents another fire from starting.
p47
aVWe call this technology EFCI,
p48
aVElectrical Fault Circuit Interrupter.
p49
aa(lp50
VOkay, two more points. Every year in the USA,
p51
aVroughly 2,500 children
p52
aVare admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries
p53
aVrelated to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.
p54
aVAn intelligent receptacle prevents injuries
p55
aVbecause the power is always off,
p56
aVuntil an intelligent plug is detected. Simple.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, besides saving lives,
p59
aVperhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power
p60
aVis in its energy savings.
p61
aVThis invention will reduce global energy consumption
p62
aVby allowing remote control and automation
p63
aVof every outlet in every home and business.
p64
aVNow you can choose to reduce your home energy bill
p65
aVby automatically cycling heavy loads
p66
aVlike air conditioners and heaters.
p67
aVHotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms
p68
aVfrom a central location, or even a cell phone.
p69
aVThere are 10 billion electrical outlets
p70
aVin North America alone.
p71
aVThe potential energy savings is very, very significant.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo far we've applied for 414 patent claims.
p74
aVOf those, 186 have been granted:
p75
aV228 are in process.
p76
aVAnd I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago
p77
aVwe received our first international recognition,
p78
aVthe 2009 CES Innovation Award.
p79
aVSo, to conclude,
p80
aVintelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,
p81
aVprevent tens of thousands of injuries,
p82
aVand eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage
p83
aVevery single year,
p84
aVwhile significantly reducing global energy consumption.
p85
aVIn the spirit of this year's TED Conference,
p86
aVwe think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.
p87
aVAnd I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity
p88
aVto unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.
p89
aVThank you.
