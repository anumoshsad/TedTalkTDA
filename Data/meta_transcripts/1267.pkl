VHumans have long held a fascination
p4
aVfor the human brain.
p5
aVWe chart it, we've described it,
p6
aVwe've drawn it,
p7
aVwe've mapped it.
p8
aVNow just like the physical maps of our world
p9
aVthat have been highly influenced by technology \u2014
p10
aVthink Google Maps,
p11
aVthink GPS \u2014
p12
aVthe same thing is happening for brain mapping
p13
aVthrough transformation.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo let's take a look at the brain.
p16
aVMost people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,
p17
aVthey say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at
p18
aVwhen someone shows you a brain."
p19
aVTypically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.
p20
aVAnd this outer layer, this is the vasculature,
p21
aVwhich is incredible, around a human brain.
p22
aVThis is the blood vessels.
p23
aV20 percent of the oxygen
p24
aVcoming from your lungs,
p25
aV20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,
p26
aVis servicing this one organ.
p27
aVThat's basically, if you hold two fists together,
p28
aVit's just slightly larger than the two fists.
p29
aa(lp30
VScientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,
p31
aVlearned that they could track blood flow
p32
aVto map non-invasively
p33
aVwhere activity was going on in the human brain.
p34
aVSo for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,
p35
aVwhich is just turning around there.
p36
aVThere's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.
p37
aVIt's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.
p38
aVOn the side here, this is temporal cortex.
p39
aVThis is the area where primary auditory processing \u2014
p40
aVso you're hearing my words,
p41
aVyou're sending it up into higher language processing centers.
p42
aVTowards the front of the brain
p43
aVis the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making \u2014
p44
aVit's the last to mature in late adulthood.
p45
aVThis is where all your decision-making processes are going on.
p46
aVIt's the place where you're deciding right now
p47
aVyou probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo if you take a deeper look at the brain,
p50
aVone of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,
p51
aVwhat you can see
p52
aVis that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.
p53
aVBut there's actually a lot of structure there.
p54
aVIt's cells and it's wires all wired together.
p55
aVSo about a hundred years ago,
p56
aVsome scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.
p57
aVAnd that's shown here in the the very light blue.
p58
aVYou can see areas
p59
aVwhere neuronal cell bodies are being stained.
p60
aVAnd what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.
p61
aVSo the outer part of that brain
p62
aVis the neocortex.
p63
aVIt's one continuous processing unit, if you will.
p64
aVBut you can also see things underneath there as well.
p65
aVAnd all of these blank areas
p66
aVare the areas in which the wires are running through.
p67
aVThey're probably less cell dense.
p68
aVSo there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.
p69
aVAnd as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.
p70
aVAnd how they're distributed really contributes
p71
aVto their underlying function.
p72
aVAnd of course, as I mentioned before,
p73
aVsince we can now start to map brain function,
p74
aVwe can start to tie these into the individual cells.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo let's take a deeper look.
p77
aVLet's look at neurons.
p78
aVSo as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.
p79
aVThere are also these smaller cells as you'll see.
p80
aVThese are support cells \u2014 astrocytes glia.
p81
aVAnd the nerves themselves
p82
aVare the ones who are receiving input.
p83
aVThey're storing it, they're processing it.
p84
aVEach neuron is connected via synapses
p85
aVto up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.
p86
aVAnd each neuron itself
p87
aVis largely unique.
p88
aVThe unique character of both individual neurons
p89
aVand neurons within a collection of the brain
p90
aVare driven by fundamental properties
p91
aVof their underlying biochemistry.
p92
aVThese are proteins.
p93
aVThey're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.
p94
aVThey're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.
p95
aVAnd they're controlling
p96
aVbasically everything that the nervous system has to do.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo if we zoom in to an even deeper level,
p99
aVall of those proteins
p100
aVare encoded by our genomes.
p101
aVWe each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
p102
aVWe get one from mom, one from dad.
p103
aVAnd on these chromosomes
p104
aVare roughly 25,000 genes.
p105
aVThey're encoded in the DNA.
p106
aVAnd the nature of a given cell
p107
aVdriving its underlying biochemistry
p108
aVis dictated by which of these 25,000 genes
p109
aVare turned on
p110
aVand at what level they're turned on.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so our project
p113
aVis seeking to look at this readout,
p114
aVunderstanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.
p115
aVSo in order to undertake such a project,
p116
aVwe obviously need brains.
p117
aVSo we sent our lab technician out.
p118
aVWe were seeking normal human brains.
p119
aVWhat we actually start with
p120
aVis a medical examiner's office.
p121
aVThis a place where the dead are brought in.
p122
aVWe are seeking normal human brains.
p123
aVThere's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.
p124
aVWe want to make sure
p125
aVthat we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,
p126
aVthey died a somewhat natural death
p127
aVwith no injury to the brain,
p128
aVno history of psychiatric disease,
p129
aVno drugs on board \u2014
p130
aVwe do a toxicology workup.
p131
aVAnd we're very careful
p132
aVabout the brains that we do take.
p133
aVWe're also selecting for brains
p134
aVin which we can get the tissue,
p135
aVwe can get consent to take the tissue
p136
aVwithin 24 hours of time of death.
p137
aVBecause what we're trying to measure, the RNA \u2014
p138
aVwhich is the readout from our genes \u2014
p139
aVis very labile,
p140
aVand so we have to move very quickly.
p141
aa(lp142
VOne side note on the collection of brains:
p143
aVbecause of the way that we collect,
p144
aVand because we require consent,
p145
aVwe actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.
p146
aVMales are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.
p147
aVAnd men are much more likely
p148
aVto have their significant other, spouse, give consent
p149
aVthan the other way around.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VSo the first thing that we do at the site of collection
p154
aVis we collect what's called an MR.
p155
aVThis is magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 MRI.
p156
aVIt's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.
p157
aVSo we collect this MR.
p158
aVAnd you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.
p159
aVThe next thing we do
p160
aVis we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.
p161
aVThis maps the large cabling in the brain.
p162
aVAnd again, you can think of this
p163
aVas almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.
p164
aVThe brain is removed from the skull,
p165
aVand then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.
p166
aVAnd those are frozen solid,
p167
aVand they're shipped to Seattle.
p168
aVAnd in Seattle, we take these \u2014
p169
aVthis is a whole human hemisphere \u2014
p170
aVand we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.
p171
aVThere's a blade here that's going to cut across
p172
aVa section of the tissue
p173
aVand transfer it to a microscope slide.
p174
aVWe're going to then apply one of those stains to it,
p175
aVand we scan it.
p176
aVAnd then what we get is our first mapping.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this is where experts come in
p179
aVand they make basic anatomic assignments.
p180
aVYou could consider this state boundaries, if you will,
p181
aVthose pretty broad outlines.
p182
aVFrom this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,
p183
aVwhich then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
p184
aVAnd this is just showing this here \u2014
p185
aVthis frozen tissue, and it's being cut.
p186
aVThis is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.
p187
aVAnd remember, it's frozen.
p188
aVAnd so you can see here,
p189
aVold-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.
p190
aVWe take a microscope slide.
p191
aVThen we very carefully melt onto the slide.
p192
aVThis will then go onto a robot
p193
aVthat's going to apply one of those stains to it.
p194
aVAnd our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo again this is what they can see under the microscope.
p197
aVYou can see collections and configurations
p198
aVof large and small cells
p199
aVin clusters and various places.
p200
aVAnd from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.
p201
aVAnd they can make basically what's a reference atlas.
p202
aVThis is a more detailed map.
p203
aa(lp204
VOur scientists then use this
p205
aVto go back to another piece of that tissue
p206
aVand do what's called laser scanning microdissection.
p207
aVSo the technician takes the instructions.
p208
aVThey scribe along a place there.
p209
aVAnd then the laser actually cuts.
p210
aVYou can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.
p211
aVYou can see on the microscope slide here,
p212
aVthat's what's happening in real time.
p213
aVThere's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.
p214
aVWe take that tissue,
p215
aVwe purify the RNA out of it
p216
aVusing some basic technology,
p217
aVand then we put a florescent tag on it.
p218
aVWe take that tagged material
p219
aVand we put it on to something called a microarray.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow this may look like a bunch of dots to you,
p222
aVbut each one of these individual dots
p223
aVis actually a unique piece of the human genome
p224
aVthat we spotted down on glass.
p225
aVThis has roughly 60,000 elements on it,
p226
aVso we repeatedly measure various genes
p227
aVof the 25,000 genes in the genome.
p228
aVAnd when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,
p229
aVwe get a unique fingerprint, if you will,
p230
aVquantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow we do this over and over again,
p233
aVthis process for any given brain.
p234
aVWe're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.
p235
aVThis area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.
p236
aVIt's involved in learning and memory.
p237
aVAnd it contributes to about 70 samples
p238
aVof those thousand samples.
p239
aVSo each sample gets us about 50,000 data points
p240
aVwith repeat measurements, a thousand samples.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo roughly, we have 50 million data points
p243
aVfor a given human brain.
p244
aVWe've done right now
p245
aVtwo human brains-worth of data.
p246
aVWe've put all of that together
p247
aVinto one thing,
p248
aVand I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.
p249
aVIt's basically a large data set of information
p250
aVthat's all freely available to any scientist around the world.
p251
aVThey don't even have to log in to come use this tool,
p252
aVmine this data, find interesting things out with this.
p253
aVSo here's the modalities that we put together.
p254
aVYou'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.
p255
aVHere's the MR. It provides the framework.
p256
aVThere's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,
p257
aVit allows you to zoom in,
p258
aVit allows you to highlight individual structures.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut most importantly,
p261
aVwe're now mapping into this anatomic framework,
p262
aVwhich is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.
p263
aVSo the red levels
p264
aVare where a gene is turned on to a great degree.
p265
aVGreen is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.
p266
aVAnd each gene gives us a fingerprint.
p267
aVAnd remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome
p268
aVand have all of that data available.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo what can scientists learn about this data?
p271
aVWe're just starting to look at this data ourselves.
p272
aVThere's some basic things that you would want to understand.
p273
aVTwo great examples are drugs,
p274
aVProzac and Wellbutrin.
p275
aVThese are commonly prescribed antidepressants.
p276
aVNow remember, we're assaying genes.
p277
aVGenes send the instructions to make proteins.
p278
aVProteins are targets for drugs.
p279
aVSo drugs bind to proteins
p280
aVand either turn them off, etc.
p281
aVSo if you want to understand the action of drugs,
p282
aVyou want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,
p283
aVand also in the ways you don't want them to.
p284
aVIn the side effect profile, etc.,
p285
aVyou want to see where those genes are turned on.
p286
aVAnd for the first time, we can actually do that.
p287
aVWe can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo now we can look throughout the brain.
p290
aVWe can see this unique fingerprint.
p291
aVAnd we get confirmation.
p292
aVWe get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on \u2014
p293
aVfor something like Prozac,
p294
aVin serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected \u2014
p295
aVbut we also get to see the whole thing.
p296
aVWe also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,
p297
aVand we see these genes turned on there.
p298
aVIt's as interesting a side effect as it could be.
p299
aVOne other thing you can do with such a thing
p300
aVis you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,
p301
aVbecause there's unique fingerprint,
p302
aVwe can actually scan through the entire genome
p303
aVand find other proteins
p304
aVthat show a similar fingerprint.
p305
aVSo if you're in drug discovery, for example,
p306
aVyou can go through
p307
aVan entire listing of what the genome has on offer
p308
aVto find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.
p309
aa(lp310
VMost of you are probably familiar
p311
aVwith genome-wide association studies
p312
aVin the form of people covering in the news
p313
aVsaying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes
p314
aVwhich affect X."
p315
aVAnd so these kinds of studies
p316
aVare routinely published by scientists
p317
aVand they're great. They analyze large populations.
p318
aVThey look at their entire genomes,
p319
aVand they try to find hot spots of activity
p320
aVthat are linked causally to genes.
p321
aVBut what you get out of such an exercise
p322
aVis simply a list of genes.
p323
aVIt tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.
p324
aVAnd so it's very important for those researchers
p325
aVthat we've created this resource.
p326
aVNow they can come in
p327
aVand they can start to get clues about activity.
p328
aVThey can start to look at common pathways \u2014
p329
aVother things that they simply haven't been able to do before.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo I think this audience in particular
p332
aVcan understand the importance of individuality.
p333
aVAnd I think every human,
p334
aVwe all have different genetic backgrounds,
p335
aVwe all have lived separate lives.
p336
aVBut the fact is
p337
aVour genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.
p338
aVWe're similar at the genetic level.
p339
aVAnd what we're finding
p340
aVis actually, even at the brain biochemical level,
p341
aVwe are quite similar.
p342
aVAnd so this shows it's not 99 percent,
p343
aVbut it's roughly 90 percent correspondence
p344
aVat a reasonable cutoff,
p345
aVso everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.
p346
aVAnd then we find some outliers,
p347
aVsome things that lie beyond the cloud.
p348
aVAnd those genes are interesting,
p349
aVbut they're very subtle.
p350
aVSo I think it's an important message
p351
aVto take home today
p352
aVthat even though we celebrate all of our differences,
p353
aVwe are quite similar
p354
aVeven at the brain level.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow what do those differences look like?
p357
aVThis is an example of a study that we did
p358
aVto follow up and see what exactly those differences were \u2014
p359
aVand they're quite subtle.
p360
aVThese are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.
p361
aVThese are two genes that we found as good examples.
p362
aVOne is called RELN \u2014 it's involved in early developmental cues.
p363
aVDISC1 is a gene
p364
aVthat's deleted in schizophrenia.
p365
aVThese aren't schizophrenic individuals,
p366
aVbut they do show some population variation.
p367
aVAnd so what you're looking at here
p368
aVin donor one and donor four,
p369
aVwhich are the exceptions to the other two,
p370
aVthat genes are being turned on
p371
aVin a very specific subset of cells.
p372
aVIt's this dark purple precipitate within the cell
p373
aVthat's telling us a gene is turned on there.
p374
aVWhether or not that's due
p375
aVto an individual's genetic background or their experiences,
p376
aVwe don't know.
p377
aVThose kinds of studies require much larger populations.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo I'm going to leave you with a final note
p380
aVabout the complexity of the brain
p381
aVand how much more we have to go.
p382
aVI think these resources are incredibly valuable.
p383
aVThey give researchers a handle
p384
aVon where to go.
p385
aVBut we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.
p386
aVWe're certainly going to be looking at more.
p387
aVI'll just close by saying
p388
aVthat the tools are there,
p389
aVand this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.
p390
aVThis is the new frontier, if you will.
p391
aVAnd so for those who are undaunted,
p392
aVbut humbled by the complexity of the brain,
p393
aVthe future awaits.
p394
aa(lp395
