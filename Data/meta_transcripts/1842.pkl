V"Give me liberty or give me death."
p4
aa(lp5
VWhen Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,
p6
aVsaid these words in 1775,
p7
aVhe could never have imagined
p8
aVjust how much they would come to resonate
p9
aVwith American generations to come.
p10
aVAt the time, these words were earmarked
p11
aVand targeted against the British,
p12
aVbut over the last 200 years, they've come to embody
p13
aVwhat many Westerners believe,
p14
aVthat freedom is the most cherished value,
p15
aVand that the best systems of politics and economics
p16
aVhave freedom embedded in them.
p17
aVWho could blame them?
p18
aVOver the past hundred years, the combination
p19
aVof liberal democracy and private capitalism
p20
aVhas helped to catapult the United States
p21
aVand Western countries
p22
aVto new levels of economic development.
p23
aVIn the United States over the past hundred years,
p24
aVincomes have increased 30 times,
p25
aVand hundreds of thousands of people
p26
aVhave been moved out of poverty.
p27
aVMeanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation
p28
aVhas helped to spur industrialization
p29
aVand also helped in the creation and the building
p30
aVof things like household appliances
p31
aVsuch as refrigerators and televisions,
p32
aVmotor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.
p33
aVIt's no surprise, then, that even at the depths
p34
aVof the private capitalism crisis,
p35
aVPresident Obama said,
p36
aV"The question before us is not whether the market
p37
aVis a force for good or ill.
p38
aVIts power to generate wealth and to expand freedom
p39
aVis unmatched."
p40
aVThus, there's understandably
p41
aVa deep-seated presumption among Westerners
p42
aVthat the whole world will decide to adopt
p43
aVprivate capitalism as the model of economic growth,
p44
aVliberal democracy, and will continue
p45
aVto prioritize political rights over economic rights.
p46
aa(lp47
VHowever, to many who live in the emerging markets,
p48
aVthis is an illusion, and even though
p49
aVthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
p50
aVwhich was signed in 1948,
p51
aVwas unanimously adopted,
p52
aVwhat it did was to mask a schism
p53
aVthat has emerged between developed and developing countries,
p54
aVand the ideological beliefs
p55
aVbetween political and economic rights.
p56
aVThis schism has only grown wider.
p57
aVToday, many people who live in the emerging markets,
p58
aVwhere 90 percent of the world's population lives,
p59
aVbelieve that the Western obsession
p60
aVwith political rights is beside the point,
p61
aVand what is actually important
p62
aVis delivering on food, shelter,
p63
aVeducation and healthcare.
p64
aV"Give me liberty or give me death"
p65
aVis all well and good if you can afford it,
p66
aVbut if you're living on less than one dollar a day,
p67
aVyou're far too busy trying to survive
p68
aVand to provide for your family
p69
aVthan to spend your time going around
p70
aVtrying to proclaim and defend democracy.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, I know many people in this room
p73
aVand around the world will think,
p74
aV"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"
p75
aVbecause private capitalism and liberal democracy
p76
aVare held sacrosanct.
p77
aVBut I ask you today, what would you do
p78
aVif you had to choose?
p79
aVWhat if you had to choose
p80
aVbetween a roof over your head
p81
aVand the right to vote?
p82
aa(lp83
VOver the last 10 years,
p84
aVI've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,
p85
aVmany of them in the emerging markets,
p86
aVin Latin America, Asia,
p87
aVand my own continent of Africa.
p88
aVI've met with presidents, dissidents,
p89
aVpolicymakers, lawyers, teachers,
p90
aVdoctors and the man on the street,
p91
aVand through these conversations,
p92
aVit's become clear to me
p93
aVthat many people in the emerging markets
p94
aVbelieve that there's actually a split occurring
p95
aVbetween what people believe ideologically
p96
aVin terms of politics and economics in the West
p97
aVand that which people believe in the rest of the world.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, don't get me wrong.
p100
aVI'm not saying people in the emerging markets
p101
aVdon't understand democracy,
p102
aVnor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally
p103
aVlike to pick their presidents or their leaders.
p104
aVOf course they would.
p105
aVHowever, I am saying that on balance,
p106
aVthey worry more about
p107
aVwhere their living standard improvements are going to come from,
p108
aVand how it is their governments can deliver for them,
p109
aVthan whether or not the government
p110
aVwas elected by democracy.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe fact of the matter
p113
aVis that this has become a very poignant question
p114
aVbecause there is for the first time in a long time
p115
aVa real challenge to the Western ideological systems
p116
aVof politics and economics,
p117
aVand this is a system that is embodied by China.
p118
aVAnd rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism.
p119
aVInstead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system.
p120
aVAnd they have also decided to prioritize
p121
aVeconomic rights over political rights.
p122
aVI put it to you today that it is this system
p123
aVthat is embodied by China
p124
aVthat is gathering momentum amongst people
p125
aVin the emerging markets as the system to follow,
p126
aVbecause they believe increasingly
p127
aVthat it is the system
p128
aVthat will promise the best and fastest improvements
p129
aVin living standards in the shortest period of time.
p130
aVIf you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments
p131
aVexplaining to you first
p132
aVwhy economically they've come to this belief.
p133
aa(lp134
VFirst of all, it's China's economic performance
p135
aVover the past 30 years.
p136
aVShe's been able to produce record economic growth
p137
aVand meaningfully move many people out of poverty,
p138
aVspecifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty
p139
aVby moving over 300 million people
p140
aVout of indigence.
p141
aVIt's not just in economics,
p142
aVbut it's also in terms of living standards.
p143
aVWe see that in China, 28 percent of people
p144
aVhad secondary school access.
p145
aVToday, it's closer to 82 percent.
p146
aVSo in its totality, economic improvement
p147
aVhas been quite significant.
p148
aa(lp149
VSecond, China has been able
p150
aVto meaningfully improve its income inequality
p151
aVwithout changing the political construct.
p152
aVToday, the United States and China
p153
aVare the two leading economies in the world.
p154
aVThey have vastly different political systems
p155
aVand different economic systems,
p156
aVone with private capitalism,
p157
aVanother one broadly with state capitalism.
p158
aVHowever, these two countries
p159
aVhave the identical GINI Coefficient,
p160
aVwhich is a measure of income equality.
p161
aVPerhaps what is more disturbing
p162
aVis that China's income equality
p163
aVhas been improving in recent times,
p164
aVwhereas that of the United States
p165
aVhas been declining.
p166
aa(lp167
VThirdly, people in the emerging markets
p168
aVlook at China's amazing and legendary
p169
aVinfrastructure rollout.
p170
aVThis is not just about China
p171
aVbuilding roads and ports and railways
p172
aVin her own country \u2014
p173
aVshe's been able to build 85,000 kilometers
p174
aVof road network in China
p175
aVand surpass that of the United States \u2014
p176
aVbut even if you look to places like Africa,
p177
aVChina has been able to help tar the distance
p178
aVof Cape Town to Cairo,
p179
aVwhich is 9,000 miles,
p180
aVor three times the distance of New York to California.
p181
aVNow this is something that people can see and point to.
p182
aVPerhaps it's no surprise
p183
aVthat in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,
p184
aVAfricans in 10 countries said
p185
aVthey thought that the Chinese were doing
p186
aVamazing things to improve their livelihoods
p187
aVby wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.
p188
aa(lp189
VFinally, China is also providing innovative solutions
p190
aVto age-old social problems that the world faces.
p191
aVIf you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,
p192
aVyou find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics
p193
aVcontinue to be a stumbling block
p194
aVto the delivery of medicine and healthcare
p195
aVin the rural areas.
p196
aVHowever, through a network of state-owned enterprises,
p197
aVthe Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,
p198
aVusing their companies
p199
aVto help deliver on these healthcare solutions.
p200
aa(lp201
VLadies and gentlemen, it's no surprise
p202
aVthat around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying,
p203
aV"I like that. I want that.
p204
aVI want to be able to do what China's doing.
p205
aVThat is the system that seems to work."
p206
aVI'm here to also tell you
p207
aVthat there are lots of shifts occurring
p208
aVaround what China is doing
p209
aVin the democratic stance.
p210
aVIn particular, there is growing doubt
p211
aVamong people in the emerging markets,
p212
aVwhen people now believe that democracy
p213
aVis no longer to be viewed
p214
aVas a prerequisite for economic growth.
p215
aVIn fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,
p216
aVnot just China, have shown that actually,
p217
aVit's economic growth that is a prerequisite
p218
aVfor democracy.
p219
aVIn a recent study, the evidence has shown
p220
aVthat income is the greatest determinant
p221
aVof how long a democracy can last.
p222
aVThe study found that if your per capita income
p223
aVis about 1,000 dollars a year,
p224
aVyour democracy will last about eight and a half years.
p225
aVIf your per capita income is between
p226
aV2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,
p227
aVthen you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.
p228
aVAnd only if your per capita income
p229
aVis above 6,000 dollars a year
p230
aVwill you have democracy come hell or high water.
p231
aa(lp232
VWhat this is telling us
p233
aVis that we need to first establish a middle class
p234
aVthat is able to hold the government accountable.
p235
aVBut perhaps it's also telling us
p236
aVthat we should be worried about going
p237
aVaround the world and shoehorning democracy,
p238
aVbecause ultimately we run the risk
p239
aVof ending up with illiberal democracies,
p240
aVdemocracies that in some sense
p241
aVcould be worse than the authoritarian governments
p242
aVthat they seek to replace.
p243
aa(lp244
VThe evidence around illiberal democracies
p245
aVis quite depressing.
p246
aVFreedom House finds that although 50 percent
p247
aVof the world's countries today are democratic,
p248
aV70 percent of those countries are illiberal
p249
aVin the sense that people don't have free speech
p250
aVor freedom of movement.
p251
aVBut also, we're finding from Freedom House
p252
aVin a study that they published last year
p253
aVthat freedom has been on the decline
p254
aVevery year for the past seven years.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat this says
p257
aVis that for people like me
p258
aVwho care about liberal democracy,
p259
aVis we've got to find a more sustainable way
p260
aVof ensuring that we have a sustainable form
p261
aVof democracy in a liberal way,
p262
aVand that has its roots in economics.
p263
aVBut it also says that as China moves
p264
aVtoward being the largest economy in the world,
p265
aVsomething that is expected to happen
p266
aVby experts in 2016,
p267
aVthat this schism between the political
p268
aVand economic ideologies of the West and the rest
p269
aVis likely to widen.
p270
aa(lp271
VWhat might that world look like?
p272
aVWell, the world could look like
p273
aVmore state involvement and state capitalism;
p274
aVgreater protectionisms of nation-states;
p275
aVbut also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,
p276
aVever-declining political rights
p277
aVand individual rights.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe question that is left for us in general
p280
aVis, what then should the West be doing?
p281
aVAnd I suggest that they have two options.
p282
aVThe West can either compete or cooperate.
p283
aVIf the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,
p284
aVand in effect go around the world
p285
aVand continue to try and push an agenda
p286
aVof private capitalism and liberal democracy,
p287
aVthis is basically going against headwinds,
p288
aVbut it also would be a natural stance
p289
aVfor the West to take
p290
aVbecause in many ways it is the antithesis
p291
aVof the Chinese model
p292
aVof de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.
p293
aVNow the fact of the matter is,
p294
aVif the West decides to compete,
p295
aVit will create a wider schism.
p296
aVThe other option is for the West to cooperate,
p297
aVand by cooperating I mean
p298
aVgiving the emerging market countries the flexibility
p299
aVto figure out in an organic way
p300
aVwhat political and economic system
p301
aVworks best for them.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow I'm sure some of you in the room
p304
aVwill be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,
p305
aVand this is a way, in other words,
p306
aVfor the West to take a back seat.
p307
aVBut I put it to you
p308
aVthat if the United States and European countries
p309
aVwant to remain globally influential,
p310
aVthey may have to consider cooperating
p311
aVin the short term in order to compete,
p312
aVand by that, they might have to focus
p313
aVmore aggressively on economic outcomes
p314
aVto help create the middle class
p315
aVand therefore be able to hold government accountable
p316
aVand create the democracies that we really want.
p317
aa(lp318
VThe fact of the matter is that
p319
aVinstead of going around the world
p320
aVand haranguing countries for engaging with China,
p321
aVthe West should be encouraging its own businesses
p322
aVto trade and invest in these regions.
p323
aVInstead of criticizing China for bad behavior,
p324
aVthe West should be showing how it is
p325
aVthat their own system of politics and economics
p326
aVis the superior one.
p327
aVAnd instead of shoehorning democracy
p328
aVaround the world,
p329
aVperhaps the West should take a leaf
p330
aVout of its own history book
p331
aVand remember that it takes a lot of patience
p332
aVin order to develop the models
p333
aVand the systems that you have today.
p334
aVIndeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
p335
aVreminds us that it took the United States
p336
aVnearly 170 years
p337
aVfrom the time that the Constitution was written
p338
aVfor there to be equal rights in the United States.
p339
aVSome people would argue that today
p340
aVthere is still no equal rights.
p341
aVIn fact, there are groups who would argue
p342
aVthat they still do not have equal rights under the law.
p343
aa(lp344
VAt its very best,
p345
aVthe Western model speaks for itself.
p346
aVIt's the model that put food on the table.
p347
aVIt's the refrigerators.
p348
aVIt put a man on the moon.
p349
aVBut the fact of the matter is,
p350
aValthough people back in the day
p351
aVused to point at the Western countries and say,
p352
aV"I want that, I like that,"
p353
aVthere's now a new person in town
p354
aVin the form of a country, China.
p355
aVToday, generations are looking at China
p356
aVand saying, "China can produce infrastructure,
p357
aVChina can produce economic growth,
p358
aVand we like that."
p359
aa(lp360
VBecause ultimately, the question before us,
p361
aVand the question before
p362
aVseven billion people on the planet
p363
aVis, how can we create prosperity?
p364
aVPeople who care and will pivot towards the model
p365
aVof politics and economics
p366
aVin a very rational way,
p367
aVto those models that will ensure
p368
aVthat they can have better living standards
p369
aVin the shortest period of time.
p370
aa(lp371
VAs you leave here today,
p372
aVI would like to leave you
p373
aVwith a very personal message,
p374
aVwhich is what it is that I believe
p375
aVwe should be doing as individuals,
p376
aVand this is really about being open-minded,
p377
aVopen-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams
p378
aVof creating prosperity for people around the world,
p379
aVcreating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty
p380
aVfor hundreds of millions of people,
p381
aVhas to be based in being open-minded,
p382
aVbecause these systems have good things
p383
aVand they have bad things.
p384
aa(lp385
VJust to illustrate,
p386
aVI went into my annals of myself.
p387
aVThat's a picture of me.
p388
aa(lp389

VI was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.
p392
aVAt the time of my birth,
p393
aVblacks were not issued birth certificates,
p394
aVand that law only changed in 1973.
p395
aVThis is an affidavit from the Zambian government.
p396
aVI bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,
p397
aVI've gone from not being recognized as a human being
p398
aVto standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today
p399
aVto talk to you about my views.
p400
aVIn this vein, we can increase economic growth.
p401
aVWe can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.
p402
aVBut also, it's going to require
p403
aVthat we look at our assumptions,
p404
aVassumptions and strictures that we've grown up with
p405
aVaround democracy, around private capitalism,
p406
aVaround what creates economic growth
p407
aVand reduces poverty and creates freedoms.
p408
aVWe might have to tear those books up
p409
aVand start to look at other options
p410
aVand be open-minded to seek the truth.
p411
aVUltimately, it's about transforming the world
p412
aVand making it a better place.
