VI'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago
p4
aVwhile writing an article for Italian Wired.
p5
aVI always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,
p6
aVbut I'd already finished editing the piece,
p7
aVand I realized that I had never once in my life
p8
aVlooked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.
p9
aa(lp10
VLet me read you the entry.
p11
aV"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,
p12
aVstalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,
p13
aVrun-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,
p14
aVsenile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in
p15
aVcracked-up, counted-out;
p16
aVsee also hurt, useless and weak.
p17
aVAntonyms, healthy, strong, capable."
p18
aVI was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,
p19
aVit was so ludicrous,
p20
aVbut I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,
p21
aVand I had to stop and collect myself
p22
aVfrom the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.
p23
aa(lp24
VYou know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus
p25
aVso I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?
p26
aVBut, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,
p27
aVwhen I would have been starting primary school
p28
aVand forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit
p29
aVand as related to the other kids and the world around me.
p30
aVAnd, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.
p31
aVI mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world
p32
aVthat perceived someone like me
p33
aVto have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,
p34
aVwhen in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures
p35
aVmy life has procured.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,
p38
aVexpecting to find a revision worth noting.
p39
aVHere's the updated version of this entry.
p40
aVUnfortunately, it's not much better.
p41
aVI find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:
p42
aV"whole" and "wholesome."
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, it's not just about the words.
p45
aVIt's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
p46
aVIt's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
p47
aVOur language affects our thinking and how we view the world
p48
aVand how we view other people.
p49
aVIn fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,
p50
aVbelieved that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,
p51
aVbecause to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
p52
aVSo, what reality do we want to call into existence:
p53
aVa person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?
p54
aVBy casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,
p55
aVwe might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
p56
aVWouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?
p57
aa(lp58
VOne such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor
p59
aVat the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
p60
aVHis name was Dr. Pizzutillo,
p61
aVan Italian American, whose name, apparently,
p62
aVwas too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,
p63
aVso he went by Dr. P.
p64
aVAnd Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties
p65
aVand had the very perfect disposition to work with children.
p66
aa(lp67
VI loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,
p68
aVwith the exception of my physical therapy sessions.
p69
aVI had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises
p70
aVwith these thick, elastic bands \u2014 different colors,
p71
aVyou know \u2014 to help build up my leg muscles,
p72
aVand I hated these bands more than anything \u2014
p73
aVI hated them, had names for them. I hated them.
p74
aVAnd, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,
p75
aVwith Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,
p76
aVunsuccessfully, of course.
p77
aVAnd, one day, he came in to my session \u2014
p78
aVexhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions \u2014
p79
aVand he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,
p80
aVI think you're going to break one of those bands.
p81
aVWhen you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part
p84
aVto get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do
p85
aVbefore the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,
p86
aVbut what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence
p87
aVinto a new and promising experience for me.
p88
aVAnd I have to wonder today to what extent his vision
p89
aVand his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl
p90
aVshaped my own view of myself
p91
aVas an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
p92
aa(lp93
VThis is an example of how adults in positions of power
p94
aVcan ignite the power of a child.
p95
aVBut, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,
p96
aVour language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,
p97
aVthe possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.
p98
aVOur language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,
p99
aVmany of which have been brought about by technology.
p100
aVCertainly, from a medical standpoint,
p101
aVmy legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,
p102
aVtitanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies
p103
aVthat are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,
p104
aVand move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them \u2014
p105
aVnot to mention social networking platforms
p106
aVallow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,
p107
aVso they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.
p108
aVSo, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now
p109
aVwhat has always been a truth:
p110
aVthat everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,
p111
aVand that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,
p114
aVbecause people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,
p115
aVand I'm going to make an admission:
p116
aVThis phrase never sat right with me,
p117
aVand I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,
p118
aVand I think I'm starting to figure out why.
p119
aVImplicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"
p120
aVis the idea that success, or happiness,
p121
aVis about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience
p122
aVunscathed or unmarked by the experience,
p123
aVas if my successes in life have come about from an ability
p124
aVto sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,
p125
aVor what other people perceive as my disability.
p126
aVBut, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,
p127
aVwhether physically, emotionally or both.
p128
aVAnd I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.
p129
aVAdversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around
p130
aVin order to resume living our life.
p131
aVIt's part of our life.
p132
aVAnd I tend to think of it like my shadow.
p133
aVSometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,
p134
aVbut it's always with me.
p135
aVAnd, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.
p136
aa(lp137
VThere is adversity and challenge in life,
p138
aVand it's all very real and relative to every single person,
p139
aVbut the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,
p140
aVbut how you're going to meet it.
p141
aVSo, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,
p142
aVbut preparing them to meet it well.
p143
aVAnd we do a disservice to our kids
p144
aVwhen we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.
p145
aVThere's an important difference and distinction
p146
aVbetween the objective medical fact of my being an amputee
p147
aVand the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.
p148
aVAnd, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront
p149
aVis the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.
p150
aa(lp151
VIn our desire to protect those we care about
p152
aVby giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,
p153
aVor, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,
p154
aVwe have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall
p155
aVthat will actually disable someone.
p156
aVPerhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you
p157
aVand how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual
p158
aVthan the pathology itself.
p159
aa(lp160
VBy not treating the wholeness of a person,
p161
aVby not acknowledging their potency,
p162
aVwe are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
p163
aVWe are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.
p164
aVSo we need to see through the pathology
p165
aVand into the range of human capability.
p166
aVAnd, most importantly, there's a partnership
p167
aVbetween those perceived deficiencies
p168
aVand our greatest creative ability.
p169
aVSo it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times
p170
aVas something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,
p171
aVbut instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
p172
aVSo maybe the idea I want to put out there is
p173
aVnot so much overcoming adversity
p174
aVas it is opening ourselves up to it,
p175
aVembracing it,
p176
aVgrappling with it,
p177
aVto use a wrestling term,
p178
aVmaybe even dancing with it.
p179
aVAnd, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,
p180
aVwe're less burdened by the presence of it.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,
p183
aVand it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,
p184
aVthat Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.
p185
aVTo paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,
p186
aVnor is it the most intelligent that survives;
p187
aVit is the one that is most adaptable to change.
p188
aVConflict is the genesis of creation.
p189
aVFrom Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that
p190
aVthe human ability to survive and flourish
p191
aVis driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict
p192
aVinto transformation.
p193
aVSo, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.
p194
aVAnd, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.
p195
aVMaybe that's what adversity gives us:
p196
aVa sense of self, a sense of our own power.
p197
aVSo, we can give ourselves a gift.
p198
aVWe can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
p199
aVMaybe we can see it as change.
p200
aVAdversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
p201
aa(lp202
VI think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves
p203
aVis this idea of normalcy.
p204
aVNow, who's normal?
p205
aVThere's no normal.
p206
aVThere's common, there's typical. There's no normal,
p207
aVand would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVI don't think so.
p210
aVIf we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy
p211
aVto one of possibility \u2014 or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous \u2014
p212
aVwe can release the power of so many more children,
p213
aVand invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnthropologists tell us that the one thing
p216
aVwe as humans have always required of our community members
p217
aVis to be of use, to be able to contribute.
p218
aVThere's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,
p219
aVcarried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,
p220
aVand perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people
p221
aVproved of value to the community.
p222
aVThey didn't view these people as broken and useless;
p223
aVthey were seen as rare and valuable.
p224
aa(lp225
VA few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up
p226
aVin that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,
p227
aVand I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
p228
aVIt was summertime: I had shorts on.
p229
aVI hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."
p230
aVAnd I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."
p233
aa(lp234
VHe said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.
p235
aVI mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVOh, that guy.
p238
aVAnd, but of course, actually, it did click.
p239
aa(lp240
VThis man was Dr. Kean,
p241
aVa man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,
p242
aVbecause, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
p243
aVAnd so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,
p244
aVso the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
p245
aVAnd, because I was born without the fibula bones,
p246
aVand had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,
p247
aVhe had to be the bearer \u2014 this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
p248
aa(lp249
VHe said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents
p250
aVthat you would never walk,
p251
aVand you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have
p252
aVor any kind of life of independence,
p253
aVand you've been making liar out of me ever since."
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aV(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VThe extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved
p258
aVnewspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,
p259
aVwhether winning a second grade spelling bee,
p260
aVmarching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,
p261
aVwinning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,
p262
aVand he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,
p263
aVmed students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
p264
aVAnd he called this part of the course the X Factor,
p265
aVthe potential of the human will.
p266
aVNo prognosis can account for how powerful this could be
p267
aVas a determinant in the quality of someone's life.
p268
aVAnd Dr. Kean went on to tell me,
p269
aVhe said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,
p270
aVand even if given a modicum of support,
p271
aVif left to their own devices, a child will achieve."
p272
aa(lp273
VSee, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.
p274
aVHe understood that there's a difference between the medical condition
p275
aVand what someone might do with it.
p276
aVAnd there's been a shift in my thinking over time,
p277
aVin that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,
p278
aVif I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,
p279
aVI wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
p280
aVI aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
p281
aVBut if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
p282
aVAnd it's because of the experiences I've had with them,
p283
aVnot in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
p284
aVAnd perhaps this shift in me has happened
p285
aVbecause I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me
p286
aVthan those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
p287
aa(lp288
VSee, all you really need is one person
p289
aVto show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.
p290
aVIf you can hand somebody the key to their own power \u2014
p291
aVthe human spirit is so receptive \u2014 if you can do that
p292
aVand open a door for someone at a crucial moment,
p293
aVyou are educating them in the best sense.
p294
aVYou're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
p295
aVIn fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"
p296
aVcomes from the root word "educe."
p297
aVIt means "to bring forth what is within,
p298
aVto bring out potential."
p299
aVSo again, which potential do we want to bring out?
p300
aa(lp301
VThere was a case study done in 1960s Britain,
p302
aVwhen they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.
p303
aVIt's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.
p304
aVIt's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
p305
aVAnd the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.
p306
aVWell, they took, over a three-month period,
p307
aVD-level students, gave them A's,
p308
aVtold them they were "A's," told them they were bright,
p309
aVand at the end of this three-month period,
p310
aVthey were performing at A-level.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,
p313
aVis that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."
p314
aVAnd that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.
p315
aVThose who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.
p316
aVA crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.
p317
aVThe teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
p318
aVThey were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"
p319
aVAnd that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,
p322
aVa spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,
p323
aVit doesn't see beauty,
p324
aVit no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity
p325
aVand our innate ability to imagine.
p326
aVIf instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,
p327
aVto see beauty in themselves and others,
p328
aVto be curious and imaginative,
p329
aVthen we are truly using our power well.
p330
aVWhen a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities
p331
aVand new ways of being.
p332
aa(lp333
VI'd like to leave you with a poem
p334
aVby a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz
p335
aVthat my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,
p336
aVand the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":
p337
aV"Every child has known God,
p338
aVnot the God of names,
p339
aVnot the God of don'ts,
p340
aVbut the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,
p341
aVsaying, 'Come dance with me.
p342
aVCome, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"
p343
