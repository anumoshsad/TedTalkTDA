(lp3
VSo on my way here,
p4
aVthe passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation
p5
aVduring my flight.
p6
aVHe told me, "It seems like the United States has run out of jobs,
p7
aVbecause they're just making some up:
p8
aVcat psychologist, dog whisperer, tornado chaser."
p9
aa(lp10
VA couple of seconds later, he asked me,
p11
aV"So what do you do?"
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I was like, "Peacebuilder?"
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VEvery day, I work to amplify the voices of women
p17
aVand to highlight their experiences
p18
aVand their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution,
p19
aVand because of my work,
p20
aVI recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally
p21
aVis by reclaiming religion.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, this matter is vitally important to me.
p24
aVAs a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith.
p25
aVIt gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day.
p26
aVIt's the reason I can be here in front of you.
p27
aVBut I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion,
p28
aVnot just my own, but all of the world's major faiths.
p29
aVThe misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture
p30
aVhas influenced our social and cultural norms,
p31
aVour laws, our daily lives,
p32
aVto a point where we sometimes don't recognize it.
p33
aa(lp34
VMy parents moved from Libya, North Africa, to Canada
p35
aVin the early 1980s,
p36
aVand I am the middle child of 11 children.
p37
aVYes, 11.
p38
aVBut growing up, I saw my parents,
p39
aVboth religiously devout and spiritual people,
p40
aVpray and praise God for their blessings,
p41
aVnamely me of course, but among others. (Laughter)
p42
aVThey were kind and funny and patient,
p43
aVlimitlessly patient, the kind of patience that having 11 kids forces you to have.
p44
aVAnd they were fair.
p45
aVI was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens.
p46
aVI was treated the same,
p47
aVthe same was expected of me.
p48
aVI was never taught that God judged differently based on gender.
p49
aVAnd my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend
p50
aVand provider shaped the way I looked at the world.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, of course, my upbringing had additional benefits.
p53
aVBeing one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101. (Laughter)
p54
aVTo this day, I am asked where I went to school,
p55
aVlike, "Did you go to Kennedy School of Government?"
p56
aVand I look at them and I'm like, "No,
p57
aVI went to the Murabit School of International Affairs."
p58
aVIt's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in.
p59
aVLucky for you, she's here.
p60
aVBut being one of 11 children and having 10 siblings
p61
aVteaches you a lot about power structures and alliances.
p62
aVIt teaches you focus; you have to talk fast or say less,
p63
aVbecause you will always get cut off.
p64
aVIt teaches you the importance of messaging.
p65
aVYou have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want,
p66
aVand you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut the most important lesson I learned growing up
p69
aVwas the importance of being at the table.
p70
aVWhen my mom's favorite lamp broke, I had to be there when she was trying
p71
aVto find out how and by who, because I had to defend myself,
p72
aVbecause if you're not, then the finger is pointed at you,
p73
aVand before you know it, you will be grounded.
p74
aVI am not speaking from experience, of course.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen I was 15 in 2005, I completed high school and I moved
p77
aVfrom Canada \u2014 Saskatoon \u2014
p78
aVto Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,
p79
aVa very traditional city.
p80
aVMind you, I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation,
p81
aVand as a seven-year-old girl, it was magic.
p82
aVIt was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives.
p83
aa(lp84
VTurns out it's not the same as a 15-year-old young lady.
p85
aVI very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion.
p86
aVThe words "haram" \u2014 meaning religiously prohibited \u2014
p87
aVand "aib" \u2014 meaning culturally inappropriate \u2014
p88
aVwere exchanged carelessly,
p89
aVas if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences.
p90
aVAnd I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates
p91
aVand colleagues, professors, friends, even relatives,
p92
aVbeginning to question my own role and my own aspirations.
p93
aVAnd even with the foundation my parents had provided for me,
p94
aVI found myself questioning the role of women in my faith.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo at the Murabit School of International Affairs,
p97
aVwe go very heavy on the debate,
p98
aVand rule number one is do your research, so that's what I did,
p99
aVand it surprised me how easy it was
p100
aVto find women in my faith who were leaders,
p101
aVwho were innovative, who were strong \u2014
p102
aVpolitically, economically, even militarily.
p103
aVKhadija financed the Islamic movement
p104
aVin its infancy.
p105
aVWe wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.
p106
aVSo why weren't we learning about her?
p107
aVWhy weren't we learning about these women?
p108
aVWhy were women being relegated to positions which predated
p109
aVthe teachings of our faith?
p110
aVAnd why, if we are equal in the eyes of God,
p111
aVare we not equal in the eyes of men?
p112
aa(lp113
VTo me, it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child.
p114
aVThe decision maker, the person who gets to control the message,
p115
aVis sitting at the table,
p116
aVand unfortunately, in every single world faith,
p117
aVthey are not women.
p118
aVReligious institutions are dominated by men
p119
aVand driven by male leadership,
p120
aVand they create policies in their likeness,
p121
aVand until we can change the system entirely,
p122
aVthen we can't realistically expect to have full economic
p123
aVand political participation of women.
p124
aVOur foundation is broken.
p125
aVMy mom actually says, you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation.
p126
aa(lp127
VIn 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out, and my family was on the front lines.
p128
aVAnd there's this amazing thing that happens in war,
p129
aVa cultural shift almost, very temporary.
p130
aVAnd it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable
p131
aVfor me to be involved, but it was encouraged.
p132
aVIt was demanded.
p133
aVMyself and other women had a seat at the table.
p134
aVWe weren't holding hands or a medium.
p135
aVWe were part of decision making.
p136
aVWe were information sharing. We were crucial.
p137
aVAnd I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent.
p138
aa(lp139
VTurns out, that's not that easy.
p140
aVIt only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with
p141
aVwere returning back to their previous roles,
p142
aVand most of them were driven by words of encouragement
p143
aVfrom religious and political leaders,
p144
aVmost of whom cited religious scripture as their defense.
p145
aVIt's how they gained popular support for their opinions.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo initially, I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women.
p148
aVI thought that would lead to cultural and social change.
p149
aVIt turns out, it does a little, but not a lot.
p150
aVI decided to use their defense as my offense,
p151
aVand I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well.
p152
aa(lp153
VIn 2012 and 2013, my organization led the single largest
p154
aVand most widespread campaign in Libya.
p155
aVWe entered homes and schools and universities, even mosques.
p156
aVWe spoke to 50,000 people directly,
p157
aVand hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials,
p158
aVradio commercials and posters.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization
p161
aVwas able to do this in communities which had previously opposed
p162
aVour sheer existence.
p163
aVI used scripture.
p164
aVI used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet,
p165
aVHadiths, his sayings which are, for example,
p166
aV"The best of you is the best to their family."
p167
aV"Do not let your brother oppress another."
p168
aVFor the first time, Friday sermons led by local community imams
p169
aVpromoted the rights of women.
p170
aVThey discussed taboo issues, like domestic violence.
p171
aVPolicies were changed.
p172
aVIn certain communities, we actually had to go as far
p173
aVas saying the International Human Rights Declaration,
p174
aVwhich you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars,
p175
aVwell, those same principles are in our book.
p176
aVSo really, the United Nations just copied us.
p177
aa(lp178
VBy changing the message, we were able to provide
p179
aVan alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya.
p180
aVIt's something that has now been replicated internationally,
p181
aVand while I am not saying it's easy \u2014 believe me, it's not.
p182
aVLiberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative.
p183
aVConservatives will call you a lot of colorful things.
p184
aVI've heard everything from, "Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you" \u2014
p185
aVfalse; they're my biggest fans \u2014
p186
aVto "You will not make it to your next birthday" \u2014
p187
aVagain wrong, because I did.
p188
aVAnd I remain
p189
aVa very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive.
p190
aVBut we have to be at the table.
p191
aVWe have to stop giving up our position, because by remaining silent,
p192
aVwe allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide.
p193
aVBy saying that we're going to fight for women's rights
p194
aVand fight extremism with bombs and warfare,
p195
aVwe completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues
p196
aVso that they're sustainable.
p197
aa(lp198
VIt is not easy, challenging distorted religious messaging.
p199
aVYou will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats.
p200
aVBut we have to do it.
p201
aVWe have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights,
p202
aVthe principles of our faith,
p203
aVnot for us, not for the women in your families,
p204
aVnot for the women in this room,
p205
aVnot even for the women out there,
p206
aVbut for societies that would be transformed
p207
aVwith the participation of women.
p208
aVAnd the only way we can do that,
p209
aVour only option,
p210
aVis to be, and remain, at the table.
p211
