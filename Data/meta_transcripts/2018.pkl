VIt was less than a year after September 11,
p4
aVand I was at the Chicago Tribune
p5
aVwriting about shootings and murders,
p6
aVand it was leaving me feeling
p7
aVpretty dark and depressed.
p8
aVI had done some activism in college,
p9
aVso I decided to help a local group
p10
aVhang door knockers against animal testing.
p11
aVI thought it would be a safe way
p12
aVto do something positive,
p13
aVbut of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,
p14
aVand we were all arrested.
p15
aVPolice took this blurry photo of me
p16
aVholding leaflets as evidence.
p17
aa(lp18
VMy charges were dismissed,
p19
aVbut a few weeks later,
p20
aVtwo FBI agents knocked on my door,
p21
aVand they told me that unless I helped them
p22
aVby spying on protest groups,
p23
aVthey would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
p24
aVI'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,
p25
aVbut I was terrified,
p26
aVand when my fear subsided,
p27
aVI became obsessed with finding out
p28
aVhow this happened,
p29
aVhow animal rights and environmental activists
p30
aVwho have never injured anyone
p31
aVcould become the FBI's number one
p32
aVdomestic terrorism threat.
p33
aa(lp34
VA few years later, I was invited to testify
p35
aVbefore Congress about my reporting,
p36
aVand I told lawmakers that, while everybody
p37
aVis talking about going green,
p38
aVsome people are risking their lives
p39
aVto defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.
p40
aVThey're physically putting their bodies on the line
p41
aVbetween the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
p42
aVThese are everyday people,
p43
aVlike these protesters in Italy
p44
aVwho spontaneously climbed over
p45
aVbarbed wire fences to rescue beagles
p46
aVfrom animal testing.
p47
aVAnd these movements have been incredibly effective
p48
aVand popular,
p49
aVso in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,
p50
aVeco-terrorist,
p51
aVto shift how we view them.
p52
aVThey just made it up.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow these companies have backed new laws
p55
aVlike the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,
p56
aVwhich turns activism into terrorism
p57
aVif it causes a loss of profits.
p58
aVNow most people never even heard about this law,
p59
aVincluding members of Congress.
p60
aVLess than one percent were in the room
p61
aVwhen it passed the House.
p62
aVThe rest were outside at a new memorial.
p63
aVThey were praising Dr. King
p64
aVas his style of activism was branded as terrorism
p65
aVif done in the name of animals or the environment.
p66
aa(lp67
VSupporters say laws like this are needed
p68
aVfor the extremists:
p69
aVthe vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
p70
aVBut right now, companies like TransCanada
p71
aVare briefing police in presentations like this one
p72
aVabout how to prosecute nonviolent protesters
p73
aVas terrorists.
p74
aVThe FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism
p75
aVare not about violence,
p76
aVthey're about public relations.
p77
aVToday, in multiple countries,
p78
aVcorporations are pushing new laws
p79
aVthat make it illegal to photograph
p80
aVanimal cruelty on their farms.
p81
aVThe latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,
p82
aVand today we released a lawsuit
p83
aVchallenging it as unconstitutional
p84
aVas a threat to journalism.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe first of these ag-gag prosecutions,
p87
aVas they're called,
p88
aVwas a young woman named Amy Meyer,
p89
aVand Amy saw a sick cow being moved
p90
aVby a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse
p91
aVas she was on the public street.
p92
aVAnd Amy did what any of us would:
p93
aVShe filmed it.
p94
aVWhen I found out about her story, I wrote about it,
p95
aVand within 24 hours, it created such an uproar
p96
aVthat the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut apparently, even exposing stuff like that
p99
aVis a threat.
p100
aVThrough the Freedom of Information Act,
p101
aVI learned that the counter-terrorism unit
p102
aVhas been monitoring my articles
p103
aVand speeches like this one.
p104
aVThey even included this nice little write-up of my book.
p105
aVThey described it as "compelling and well-written."
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVBlurb on the next book, right?
p108
aa(lp109
VThe point of all of this is to make us afraid,
p110
aVbut as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith
p111
aVin the power of education.
p112
aVOur best weapon is sunlight.
p113
aa(lp114
VDostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man
p115
aVis to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
p116
aVOver and over throughout history,
p117
aVpeople in power have used fear
p118
aVto silence the truth and to silence dissent.
p119
aVIt's time we strike a new note.
p120
aa(lp121
VThank you.
