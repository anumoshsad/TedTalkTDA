VSo, imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized
p4
aVand hooked up directly to your brain.
p5
aVIf you had this sort of brain chip,
p6
aVyou'd be able to upload and download to the internet
p7
aVat the speed of thought.
p8
aVAccessing social media or Wikipedia would be a lot like \u2014
p9
aVwell, from the inside at least \u2014
p10
aVlike consulting your own memory.
p11
aVIt would be as easy and as intimate as thinking.
p12
aVBut would it make it easier for you to know what's true?
p13
aVJust because a way of accessing information is faster
p14
aVit doesn't mean it's more reliable, of course,
p15
aVand it doesn't mean that we would all interpret it the same way.
p16
aVAnd it doesn't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it.
p17
aVIn fact, you might even be worse,
p18
aVbecause, you know, more data, less time for evaluation.
p19
aa(lp20
VSomething like this is already happening to us right now.
p21
aVWe already carry a world of information around in our pockets,
p22
aVbut it seems as if the more information we share and access online,
p23
aVthe more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference
p24
aVbetween what's real and what's fake.
p25
aVIt's as if we know more but understand less.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, it's a feature of modern life, I suppose,
p28
aVthat large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles.
p29
aVWe're polarized: not just over values, but over the facts.
p30
aVOne reason for that is, the data analytics that drive the internet
p31
aVget us not just more information,
p32
aVbut more of the information that we want.
p33
aVOur online life is personalized;
p34
aVeverything from the ads we read
p35
aVto the news that comes down our Facebook feed
p36
aVis tailored to satisfy our preferences.
p37
aVAnd so while we get more information,
p38
aVa lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves
p39
aVas much as it does reality.
p40
aVIt ends up, I suppose,
p41
aVinflating our bubbles rather than bursting them.
p42
aVAnd so maybe it's no surprise
p43
aVthat we're in a situation, a paradoxical situation,
p44
aVof thinking that we know so much more,
p45
aVand yet not agreeing on what it is we know.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization?
p48
aVOne obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology,
p49
aVto redesign our digital platforms,
p50
aVso as to make them less susceptible to polarization.
p51
aVAnd I'm happy to report
p52
aVthat many smart people at Google and Facebook are working on just that.
p53
aVAnd these projects are vital.
p54
aVI think that fixing technology is obviously really important,
p55
aVbut I don't think technology alone, fixing it, is going to solve the problem
p56
aVof knowledge polarization.
p57
aVI don't think that because I don't think, at the end of the day,
p58
aVit is a technological problem.
p59
aVI think it's a human problem,
p60
aVhaving to do with how we think and what we value.
p61
aa(lp62
VIn order to solve it, I think we're going to need help.
p63
aVWe're going to need help from psychology and political science.
p64
aVBut we're also going to need help, I think, from philosophy.
p65
aVBecause to solve the problem of knowledge polarization,
p66
aVwe're going to need to reconnect
p67
aVwith one fundamental, philosophical idea:
p68
aVthat we live in a common reality.
p69
aVThe idea of a common reality is like, I suppose,
p70
aVa lot of philosophical concepts:
p71
aVeasy to state
p72
aVbut mysteriously difficult to put into practice.
p73
aVTo really accept it,
p74
aVI think we need to do three things,
p75
aVeach of which is a challenge right now.
p76
aa(lp77
VFirst, we need to believe in truth.
p78
aVYou might have noticed
p79
aVthat our culture is having something of a troubled relationship
p80
aVwith that concept right now.
p81
aVIt seems as if we disagree so much that,
p82
aVas one political commentator put it not long ago,
p83
aVit's as if there are no facts anymore.
p84
aVBut that thought is actually an expression
p85
aVof a sort of seductive line of argument that's in the air.
p86
aVIt goes like this:
p87
aVwe just can't step outside of our own perspectives;
p88
aVwe can't step outside of our biases.
p89
aVEvery time we try,
p90
aVwe just get more information from our perspective.
p91
aVSo, this line of thought goes,
p92
aVwe might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion,
p93
aVor it doesn't matter,
p94
aVbecause either we'll never know what it is,
p95
aVor it doesn't exist in the first place.
p96
aa(lp97
VThat's not a new philosophical thought \u2014
p98
aVskepticism about truth.
p99
aVDuring the end of the last century, as some of you know,
p100
aVit was very popular in certain academic circles.
p101
aVBut it really goes back all the way to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,
p102
aVif not farther back.
p103
aVProtagoras said that objective truth was an illusion
p104
aVbecause "man is the measure of all things."
p105
aVMan is the measure of all things.
p106
aVThat can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people,
p107
aVor liberating,
p108
aVbecause it allows each of us to discover or make our own truth.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut actually, I think it's a bit of self-serving rationalization
p111
aVdisguised as philosophy.
p112
aVIt confuses the difficulty of being certain
p113
aVwith the impossibility of truth.
p114
aVLook \u2014
p115
aVof course it's difficult to be certain about anything;
p116
aVwe might all be living in "The Matrix."
p117
aVYou might have a brain chip in your head
p118
aVfeeding you all the wrong information.
p119
aVBut in practice, we do agree on all sorts of facts.
p120
aVWe agree that bullets can kill people.
p121
aVWe agree that you can't flap your arms and fly.
p122
aVWe agree \u2014 or we should \u2014
p123
aVthat there is an external reality
p124
aVand ignoring it can get you hurt.
p125
aa(lp126
VNonetheless, skepticism about truth can be tempting,
p127
aVbecause it allows us to rationalize away our own biases.
p128
aVWhen we do that, we're sort of like the guy in the movie
p129
aVwho knew he was living in "The Matrix"
p130
aVbut decided he liked it there, anyway.
p131
aVAfter all, getting what you want feels good.
p132
aVBeing right all the time feels good.
p133
aVSo, often it's easier for us
p134
aVto wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles,
p135
aVlive in bad faith,
p136
aVand take those bubbles as the measure of reality.
p137
aa(lp138
VAn example, I think, of how this bad faith gets into our action
p139
aVis our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news.
p140
aVThe fake news that spread on the internet
p141
aVduring the American presidential election of 2016
p142
aVwas designed to feed into our biases,
p143
aVdesigned to inflate our bubbles.
p144
aVBut what was really striking about it
p145
aVwas not just that it fooled so many people.
p146
aVWhat was really striking to me about fake news,
p147
aVthe phenomenon,
p148
aVis how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization;
p149
aVso much so, that the very term \u2014 the very term \u2014 "fake news"
p150
aVnow just means: "news story I don't like."
p151
aVThat's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that I'm talking about.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut the really, I think, dangerous thing
p154
aVabout skepticism with regard to truth
p155
aVis that it leads to despotism.
p156
aV"Man is the measure of all things"
p157
aVinevitably becomes "The Man is the measure of all things."
p158
aVJust as "every man for himself"
p159
aValways seems to turn out to be "only the strong survive."
p160
aa(lp161
VAt the end of Orwell's "1984,"
p162
aVthe thought policeman O'Brien is torturing the protagonist Winston Smith
p163
aVinto believing two plus two equals five.
p164
aVWhat O'Brien says is the point,
p165
aVis that he wants to convince Smith that whatever the party says is the truth,
p166
aVand the truth is whatever the party says.
p167
aVAnd what O'Brien knows is that once this thought is accepted,
p168
aVcritical dissent is impossible.
p169
aVYou can't speak truth to power
p170
aVif the power speaks truth by definition.
p171
aa(lp172
VI said that in order to accept that we really live in a common reality,
p173
aVwe have to do three things.
p174
aVThe first thing is to believe in truth.
p175
aVThe second thing can be summed up
p176
aVby the Latin phrase that Kant took as the motto for the Enlightenment:
p177
aV"Sapere aude,"
p178
aVor "dare to know."
p179
aVOr as Kant wants, "to dare to know for yourself."
p180
aa(lp181
VI think in the early days of the internet,
p182
aVa lot of us thought
p183
aVthat information technology was always going to make it easier
p184
aVfor us to know for ourselves,
p185
aVand of course in many ways, it has.
p186
aVBut as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives,
p187
aVour reliance on it, our use of it,
p188
aVhas become often more passive.
p189
aVMuch of what we know today we Google-know.
p190
aVWe download prepackaged sets of facts
p191
aVand sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media.
p192
aVNow, Google-knowing is useful
p193
aVprecisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
p194
aVWe offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms.
p195
aVAnd that allows us, of course, to not clutter our minds
p196
aVwith all sorts of facts.
p197
aVWe can just download them when we need them.
p198
aVAnd that's awesome.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut there's a difference between downloading a set of facts
p201
aVand really understanding how or why those facts are as they are.
p202
aVUnderstanding why a particular disease spreads,
p203
aVor how a mathematical proof works,
p204
aVor why your friend is depressed,
p205
aVinvolves more than just downloading.
p206
aVIt's going to require, most likely,
p207
aVdoing some work for yourself:
p208
aVhaving a little creative insight;
p209
aVusing your imagination;
p210
aVgetting out into the field;
p211
aVdoing the experiment;
p212
aVworking through the proof;
p213
aVtalking to someone.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, I'm not saying, of course, that we should stop Google-knowing.
p216
aVI'm just saying
p217
aVwe shouldn't overvalue it, either.
p218
aVWe need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active,
p219
aVand don't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble.
p220
aVBecause the thing about Google-knowing is that too often it ends up
p221
aVbeing bubble-knowing.
p222
aVAnd bubble-knowing means always being right.
p223
aVBut daring to know,
p224
aVdaring to understand,
p225
aVmeans risking the possibility that you could be wrong.
p226
aVIt means risking the possibility
p227
aVthat what you want and what's true are different things.
p228
aa(lp229
VWhich brings me to the third thing that I think we need to do
p230
aVif we want to accept that we live in a common reality.
p231
aVThat third thing is: have a little humility.
p232
aVBy humility here, I mean epistemic humility,
p233
aVwhich means, in a sense,
p234
aVknowing that you don't know it all.
p235
aVBut it also means something more than that.
p236
aVIt means seeing your worldview as open to improvement
p237
aVby the evidence and experience of others.
p238
aVSeeing your worldview as open to improvement
p239
aVby the evidence and experience of others.
p240
aVThat's more than just being open to change.
p241
aVIt's more than just being open to self-improvement.
p242
aVIt means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing
p243
aVor being enriched by what others contribute.
p244
aVThat's part of what is involved
p245
aVin recognizing there's a common reality
p246
aVthat you, too, are responsible to.
p247
aa(lp248
VI don't think it's much of a stretch to say
p249
aVthat our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging
p250
aVthat sort of humility.
p251
aVThat's partly because,
p252
aVwell, we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence.
p253
aVAnd it's partly because, well, you know,
p254
aVarrogance is just easier.
p255
aVIt's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all.
p256
aVIt's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.
p257
aVBut that's another example of the bad faith towards the truth
p258
aVthat I've been talking about.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo the concept of a common reality,
p261
aVlike a lot of philosophical concepts,
p262
aVcan seem so obvious,
p263
aVthat we can look right past it
p264
aVand forget why it's important.
p265
aVDemocracies can't function if their citizens don't strive,
p266
aVat least some of the time,
p267
aVto inhabit a common space,
p268
aVa space where they can pass ideas back and forth
p269
aVwhen \u2014 and especially when \u2014
p270
aVthey disagree.
p271
aVBut you can't strive to inhabit that space
p272
aVif you don't already accept that you live in the same reality.
p273
aVTo accept that, we've got to believe in truth,
p274
aVwe've got to encourage more active ways of knowing.
p275
aVAnd we've got to have the humility
p276
aVto realize that we're not the measure of all things.
p277
aa(lp278
VWe may yet one day realize the vision
p279
aVof having the internet in our brains.
p280
aVBut if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying,
p281
aVif we want it to expand our understanding
p282
aVand not just our passive knowing,
p283
aVwe need to remember that our perspectives,
p284
aVas wondrous, as beautiful as they are,
p285
aVare just that \u2014
p286
aVperspectives on one reality.
