VTen years ago, on a Tuesday morning,
p4
aVI conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
p5
aVIt was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done
p6
aVsince I became a paratrooper
p7
aV27 years before.
p8
aVWe went down to the airfield early
p9
aVbecause this is the Army and you always go early.
p10
aVYou do some routine refresher training,
p11
aVand then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.
p12
aVAnd you put on the T-10 parachute.
p13
aVAnd you're very careful how you put the straps,
p14
aVparticularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.
p15
aVAnd then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.
p16
aVAnd then a jumpmaster comes,
p17
aVand he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.
p18
aVHe checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps
p19
aVand he tightens everything
p20
aVso that your chest is crushed,
p21
aVyour shoulders are crushed down,
p22
aVand, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.
p23
aVThen you sit down, and you wait a little while,
p24
aVbecause this is the Army.
p25
aVThen you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,
p26
aVand you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,
p27
aVand you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.
p28
aVAnd you wait a little bit longer,
p29
aVbecause this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.
p30
aa(lp31
VThen you take off.
p32
aVAnd it's painful enough now \u2014
p33
aVand I think it's designed this way \u2014
p34
aVit's painful enough so you want to jump.
p35
aVYou didn't really want to jump, but you want out.
p36
aVSo you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,
p37
aVand at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.
p38
aVThey give 20 minutes \u2014 that's a time warning.
p39
aVYou sit there, OK.
p40
aVThen they give you 10 minutes.
p41
aVAnd of course, you're responding with all of these.
p42
aVAnd that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.
p43
aVThen they give you, "Get ready."
p44
aVThen they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."
p45
aVIf you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.
p46
aVIf you're an inboard personnel, stand up.
p47
aVAnd then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.
p48
aVAnd at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?
p49
aVI'm probably going to jump.
p50
aVThere's no way to get out of this at this point."
p51
aVYou go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd this was that Tuesday morning in September,
p54
aVand it was pretty nice outside.
p55
aVSo nice air comes flowing in.
p56
aVThe jumpmasters start to check the door.
p57
aVAnd then when it's time to go,
p58
aVa green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."
p59
aVThe first guy goes, and you're just in line,
p60
aVand you just kind of lumber to the door.
p61
aVJump is a misnomer; you fall.
p62
aVYou fall outside the door,
p63
aVyou're caught in the slipstream.
p64
aVThe first thing you do is lock into a tight body position \u2014
p65
aVhead down in your chest, your arms extended,
p66
aVput over your reserve parachute.
p67
aVYou do that because, 27 years before,
p68
aVan airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.
p69
aVI have no idea whether it makes any difference,
p70
aVbut he seemed to make sense,
p71
aVand I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
p72
aVAnd then you wait for the opening shock
p73
aVfor your parachute to open.
p74
aVIf you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute \u2014
p75
aVyou've got a whole new problem set.
p76
aVBut typically you do; typically it opens.
p77
aVAnd of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,
p78
aVat that point you get another little thrill.
p79
aVBoom.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo then you look around,
p82
aVyou're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."
p83
aVNow you prepare for the inevitable.
p84
aVYou are going to hit the ground.
p85
aVYou can't delay that much.
p86
aVAnd you really can't decide where you hit very much,
p87
aVbecause they pretend you can steer,
p88
aVbut you're being delivered.
p89
aVSo you look around, where you're going to land,
p90
aVyou try to make yourself ready.
p91
aVAnd then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,
p92
aVso that it's not on you when you land,
p93
aVand you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
p94
aVNow the Army teaches you
p95
aVto do five points of performance \u2014
p96
aVthe toes of your feet,
p97
aVyour calves, your thighs,
p98
aVyour buttocks and your push-up muscles.
p99
aVIt's this elegant little land, twist and roll.
p100
aVAnd that's not going to hurt.
p101
aVIn 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVI always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd as soon as I hit,
p108
aVthe first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.
p109
aVI'd shake my head,
p110
aVand I'd ask myself the eternal question:
p111
aV"Why didn't I go into banking?"
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVAnd I'd look around,
p114
aVand then I'd see another paratrooper,
p115
aVa young guy or girl,
p116
aVand they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine
p117
aVand they'd be picking up their equipment.
p118
aVThey'd be doing everything
p119
aVthat we had taught them.
p120
aVAnd I realized
p121
aVthat, if they had to go into combat,
p122
aVthey would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.
p123
aVAnd I realized that, if they came out of combat,
p124
aVit would be because we led them well.
p125
aVAnd I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo now I do that Tuesday morning jump,
p128
aVbut it's not any jump \u2014
p129
aVthat was September 11th, 2001.
p130
aVAnd when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.
p131
aVWhen we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.
p132
aVAnd what we thought
p133
aVabout the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat
p134
aVas being theoretical
p135
aVwas now very, very real \u2014
p136
aVand leadership seemed important.
p137
aVBut things had changed;
p138
aVI was a 46-year-old brigadier general.
p139
aVI'd been successful,
p140
aVbut things changed so much
p141
aVthat I was going to have to make some significant changes,
p142
aVand on that morning, I didn't know it.
p143
aa(lp144
VI was raised with traditional stories of leadership:
p145
aVRobert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.
p146
aVAnd I also was raised
p147
aVwith personal examples of leadership.
p148
aVThis was my father in Vietnam.
p149
aVAnd I was raised to believe
p150
aVthat soldiers were strong and wise
p151
aVand brave and faithful;
p152
aVthey didn't lie, cheat, steal
p153
aVor abandon their comrades.
p154
aVAnd I still believe real leaders are like that.
p155
aVBut in my first 25 years of career,
p156
aVI had a bunch of different experiences.
p157
aa(lp158
VOne of my first battalion commanders,
p159
aVI worked in his battalion for 18 months
p160
aVand the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal
p161
aVwas at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,
p162
aVand he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.
p163
aVAnd I'm not sure that was real interaction.
p164
aVBut then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,
p165
aVI went out to the National Training Center.
p166
aVAnd we did an operation,
p167
aVand my company did a dawn attack \u2014
p168
aVyou know, the classic dawn attack:
p169
aVyou prepare all night, move to the line of departure.
p170
aVAnd I had an armored organization at that point.
p171
aVWe move forward, and we get wiped out \u2014
p172
aVI mean, wiped out immediately.
p173
aVThe enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.
p174
aVAnd after the battle,
p175
aVthey bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review"
p176
aVto teach you what you've done wrong.
p177
aVSort of leadership by humiliation.
p178
aVThey put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:
p179
aV"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."
p180
aVI walked out feeling as low
p181
aVas a snake's belly in a wagon rut.
p182
aVAnd I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.
p183
aVAnd I went up to apologize to him,
p184
aVand he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."
p185
aVAnd in one sentence,
p186
aVhe lifted me, put me back on my feet,
p187
aVand taught me that leaders can let you fail
p188
aVand yet not let you be a failure.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhen 9/11 came,
p191
aV46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.
p192
aVFirst, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:
p193
aVthe environment changed \u2014
p194
aVthe speed, the scrutiny,
p195
aVthe sensitivity of everything now is so fast,
p196
aVsometimes it evolves faster
p197
aVthan people have time to really reflect on it.
p198
aVBut everything we do
p199
aVis in a different context.
p200
aVMore importantly, the force that I led
p201
aVwas spread over more than 20 countries.
p202
aVAnd instead of being able to get all the key leaders
p203
aVfor a decision together in a single room
p204
aVand look them in the eye and build their confidence
p205
aVand get trust from them,
p206
aVI'm now leading a force that's dispersed,
p207
aVand I've got to use other techniques.
p208
aVI've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,
p209
aVI've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls \u2014
p210
aVI've got to use everything I can,
p211
aVnot just for communication,
p212
aVbut for leadership.
p213
aVA 22-year-old individual
p214
aVoperating alone,
p215
aVthousands of miles from me,
p216
aVhas got to communicate to me with confidence.
p217
aVI have to have trust in them and vice versa.
p218
aVAnd I also have to build their faith.
p219
aVAnd that's a new kind of leadership
p220
aVfor me.
p221
aa(lp222
VWe had one operation
p223
aVwhere we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.
p224
aVAn emerging opportunity came \u2014
p225
aVdidn't have time to get everybody together.
p226
aVSo we had to get complex intelligence together,
p227
aVwe had to line up the ability to act.
p228
aVIt was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,
p229
aVconvince them that this was the right thing to do
p230
aVand do all of this
p231
aVon electronic medium.
p232
aVWe failed.
p233
aVThe mission didn't work.
p234
aVAnd so now what we had to do
p235
aVis I had to reach out
p236
aVto try to rebuild the trust of that force,
p237
aVrebuild their confidence \u2014
p238
aVme and them, and them and me,
p239
aVand our seniors and us as a force \u2014
p240
aVall without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.
p241
aVEntirely new requirement.
p242
aa(lp243
VAlso, the people had changed.
p244
aVYou probably think that the force that I led
p245
aVwas all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists
p246
aVcarrying exotic weapons.
p247
aVIn reality,
p248
aVmuch of the force I led
p249
aVlooked exactly like you.
p250
aVIt was men, women, young, old \u2014
p251
aVnot just from military; from different organizations,
p252
aVmany of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
p253
aVAnd so instead of giving orders,
p254
aVyou're now building consensus
p255
aVand you're building a sense of shared purpose.
p256
aVProbably the biggest change
p257
aVwas understanding that the generational difference,
p258
aVthe ages, had changed so much.
p259
aVI went down to be with a Ranger platoon
p260
aVon an operation in Afghanistan,
p261
aVand on that operation,
p262
aVa sergeant in the platoon
p263
aVhad lost about half his arm
p264
aVthrowing a Taliban hand grenade
p265
aVback at the enemy
p266
aVafter it had landed in his fire team.
p267
aVWe talked about the operation,
p268
aVand then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.
p269
aVI asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"
p270
aVAnd one young Ranger in the back \u2014
p271
aVhis hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown
p272
aVfrom being in combat in the cold Afghan wind \u2014
p273
aVhe said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."
p274
aVAnd it reminded me
p275
aVthat we're operating a force
p276
aVthat must have shared purpose
p277
aVand shared consciousness,
p278
aVand yet he has different experiences,
p279
aVin many cases a different vocabulary,
p280
aVa completely different skill set
p281
aVin terms of digital media
p282
aVthan I do and many of the other senior leaders.
p283
aVAnd yet, we need to have that shared sense.
p284
aa(lp285
VIt also produced something
p286
aVwhich I call an inversion of expertise,
p287
aVbecause we had so many changes at the lower levels
p288
aVin technology and tactics and whatnot,
p289
aVthat suddenly the things that we grew up doing
p290
aVwasn't what the force was doing anymore.
p291
aVSo how does a leader
p292
aVstay credible and legitimate
p293
aVwhen they haven't done
p294
aVwhat the people you're leading are doing?
p295
aVAnd it's a brand new leadership challenge.
p296
aVAnd it forced me to become a lot more transparent,
p297
aVa lot more willing to listen,
p298
aVa lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.
p299
aVAnd yet, again, you're not all in one room.
p300
aVThen another thing.
p301
aVThere's an effect on you and on your leaders.
p302
aVThere's an impact, it's cumulative.
p303
aVYou don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.
p304
aa(lp305
VI stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq
p306
aVwith one of my senior officers
p307
aVand we watched a firefight from one of our forces.
p308
aVAnd I remembered his son was in our force.
p309
aVAnd I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"
p310
aVAnd he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."
p311
aVI said, "Where is he now?"
p312
aVAnd he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."
p313
aVThink about watching your brother, father,
p314
aVdaughter, son, wife
p315
aVin a firefight in real time
p316
aVand you can't do anything about it.
p317
aVThink about knowing that over time.
p318
aVAnd it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd you have to watch and take care of each other.
p321
aVI probably learned the most about relationships.
p322
aVI learned they are the sinew
p323
aVwhich hold the force together.
p324
aVI grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.
p325
aVAnd every morning in the Ranger regiment,
p326
aVevery Ranger \u2014 and there are more than 2,000 of them \u2014
p327
aVsays a six-stanza Ranger creed.
p328
aVYou may know one line of it, it says,
p329
aV"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."
p330
aVAnd it's not a mindless mantra,
p331
aVand it's not a poem.
p332
aVIt's a promise.
p333
aVEvery Ranger promises every other Ranger,
p334
aV"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,
p335
aVif you need me, I'm coming."
p336
aVAnd every Ranger gets that same promise
p337
aVfrom every other Ranger.
p338
aVThink about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
p339
aVIt's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
p340
aVAnd they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.
p341
aVAnd so the organizational relationship that bonds them
p342
aVis just amazing.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd I learned personal relationships
p345
aVwere more important than ever.
p346
aVWe were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,
p347
aVand an old friend of mine,
p348
aVthat I had spent many years
p349
aVat various points of my career with \u2014
p350
aVgodfather to one of their kids \u2014
p351
aVhe sent me a note, just in an envelope,
p352
aVthat had a quote from Sherman to Grant
p353
aVthat said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,
p354
aVthat you would come, if alive."
p355
aVAnd having that kind of relationship, for me,
p356
aVturned out to be critical at many points in my career.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd I learned that you have to give that
p359
aVin this environment,
p360
aVbecause it's tough.
p361
aVThat was my journey.
p362
aVI hope it's not over.
p363
aVI came to believe
p364
aVthat a leader isn't good because they're right;
p365
aVthey're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.
p366
aVThis isn't easy stuff.
p367
aVIt's not like that electronic abs machine
p368
aVwhere, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aVAnd it isn't always fair.
p371
aVYou can get knocked down,
p372
aVand it hurts
p373
aVand it leaves scars.
p374
aVBut if you're a leader,
p375
aVthe people you've counted on
p376
aVwill help you up.
p377
aVAnd if you're a leader,
p378
aVthe people who count on you need you on your feet.
p379
aa(lp380
VThank you.
