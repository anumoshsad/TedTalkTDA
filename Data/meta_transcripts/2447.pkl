VI want to tell you the story
p4
aVabout the time I almost got kidnapped
p5
aVin the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
p6
aVIt's the day after graduating from design school
p7
aVand I'm having a yard sale.
p8
aVAnd this guy pulls up in this red Mazda
p9
aVand he starts looking through my stuff.
p10
aVAnd he buys a piece of art that I made.
p11
aVAnd it turns out he's alone in town for the night,
p12
aVdriving cross-country on a road trip
p13
aVbefore he goes into the Peace Corps.
p14
aVSo I invite him out for a beer
p15
aVand he tells me all about his passion
p16
aVfor making a difference in the world.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow it's starting to get late,
p19
aVand I'm getting pretty tired.
p20
aVAs I motion for the tab,
p21
aVI make the mistake of asking him,
p22
aV"So where are you staying tonight?"
p23
aVAnd he makes it worse by saying,
p24
aV"Actually, I don't have a place."
p25
aVAnd I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"
p26
aVWhat do you do?
p27
aVWe've all been there, right?
p28
aVDo I offer to host this guy?
p29
aVBut, I just met him \u2014 I mean,
p30
aVhe says he's going to the Peace Corps,
p31
aVbut I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps
p32
aVand I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.
p33
aVThat's a small trunk!
p34
aa(lp35
VSo then I hear myself saying,
p36
aV"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."
p37
aVAnd the voice in my head goes,
p38
aV"Wait, what?"
p39
aa(lp40
VThat night, I'm laying in bed,
p41
aVI'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,
p42
aV"Oh my god, what have I done?
p43
aVThere's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.
p44
aVWhat if he's psychotic?"
p45
aVMy anxiety grows so much,
p46
aVI leap out of bed,
p47
aVI sneak on my tiptoes to the door,
p48
aVand I lock the bedroom door.
p49
aa(lp50
VIt turns out he was not psychotic.
p51
aVWe've kept in touch ever since.
p52
aVAnd the piece of art he bought at the yard sale
p53
aVis hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.
p54
aa(lp55
VThis was my first hosting experience,
p56
aVand it completely changed my perspective.
p57
aVMaybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers
p58
aVwere actually friends waiting to be discovered.
p59
aVThe idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me
p60
aVand when I moved to San Francisco,
p61
aVI brought the airbed with me.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo now it's two years later.
p64
aVI'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,
p65
aVmy roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.
p66
aVAnd then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,
p67
aVand all the hotels are sold out.
p68
aVAnd I've always believed that turning fear into fun
p69
aVis the gift of creativity.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:
p72
aV"Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks \u2014
p73
aVturning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'
p74
aVoffering young designers who come to town a place to crash,
p75
aVcomplete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,
p76
aVsleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.
p77
aVHa!"
p78
aa(lp79
VWe built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
p80
aVThree lucky guests got to stay
p81
aVon a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.
p82
aVBut they loved it, and so did we.
p83
aVI swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made
p84
aVtasted totally different because we made them for our guests.
p85
aVWe took them on adventures around the city,
p86
aVand when we said goodbye to the last guest,
p87
aVthe door latch clicked,
p88
aVBrian and I just stared at each other.
p89
aVDid we just discover it was possible to make friends
p90
aVwhile also making rent?
p91
aa(lp92
VThe wheels had started to turn.
p93
aVMy old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,
p94
aVjoined as engineering co-founder.
p95
aVAnd we buckled down to see
p96
aVif we could turn this into a business.
p97
aa(lp98
VHere's what we pitched investors:
p99
aV"We want to build a website
p100
aVwhere people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces,
p101
aVtheir bedrooms, the bathrooms \u2014
p102
aVthe kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.
p103
aVAnd then, over the Internet,
p104
aVthey're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.
p105
aVIt's going to be huge!"
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VWe sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.
p110
aVIt did not.
p111
aVNo one in their right minds would invest in a service
p112
aVthat allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.
p113
aVWhy?
p114
aVBecause we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,
p117
aVand all we really knew was design.
p118
aVIn art school, you learn that design is much more
p119
aVthan the look and feel of something \u2014 it's the whole experience.
p120
aVWe learned to do that for objects,
p121
aVbut here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust
p122
aVbetween people who had never met.
p123
aVCould design make that happen?
p124
aVIs it possible to design for trust?
p125
aa(lp126
VI want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust
p127
aVthat we were aiming to achieve.
p128
aVI've got a 30-second experiment
p129
aVthat will push you past your comfort zone.
p130
aVIf you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
p131
aVOK, I need you to take out your phones.
p132
aVNow that you have your phone out,
p133
aVI'd like you to unlock your phone.
p134
aVNow hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VThat tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
Vis exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.
p143
aVBecause the only thing more personal than your phone
p144
aVis your home.
p145
aVPeople don't just see your messages,
p146
aVthey see your bedroom,
p147
aVyour kitchen, your toilet.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?
p150
aVMost of us feel really responsible.
p151
aVThat's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.
p152
aVAnd it's because of this that our company can even exist.
p153
aVBy the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VWould you tell Twitter he's running for President?
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VOK, you can hand your phones back now.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge
p166
aVwe were facing,
p167
aVI'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.
p168
aVWhat if we changed one small thing
p169
aVabout the design of that experiment?
p170
aVWhat if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name,
p171
aVwhere they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
p172
aVImagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying,
p173
aV"They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VNow how would you feel about handing your phone over?
p178
aa(lp179
VIt turns out,
p180
aVa well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
p181
aVAnd we didn't actually get it right the first time.
p182
aVIt's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
p183
aVEventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts
p184
aVleft the review before we reveal them.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, here's a discovery we made just last week.
p187
aVWe did a joint study with Stanford,
p188
aVwhere we looked at people's willingness to trust someone
p189
aVbased on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
p190
aVThe research showed, not surprisingly,
p191
aVwe prefer people who are like us.
p192
aVThe more different somebody is,
p193
aVthe less we trust them.
p194
aVNow, that's a natural social bias.
p195
aVBut what's interesting is what happens
p196
aVwhen you add reputation into the mix,
p197
aVin this case, with reviews.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, if you've got less than three reviews,
p200
aVnothing changes.
p201
aVBut if you've got more than 10,
p202
aVeverything changes.
p203
aVHigh reputation beats high similarity.
p204
aVThe right design can actually help us overcome
p205
aVone of our most deeply rooted biases.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow we also learned that building the right amount of trust
p208
aVtakes the right amount of disclosure.
p209
aVThis is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
p210
aVIf you share too little, like, "Yo,"
p211
aVacceptance rates go down.
p212
aVAnd if you share too much, like,
p213
aV"I'm having issues with my mother,"
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
Vacceptance rates also go down.
p218
aVBut there's a zone that's just right,
p219
aVlike, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."
p220
aVSo how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
p221
aVWe use the size of the box to suggest the right length,
p222
aVand we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe bet our whole company
p225
aVon the hope that,
p226
aVwith the right design,
p227
aVpeople would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
p228
aVWhat we didn't realize
p229
aVis just how many people
p230
aVwere ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
p233
aVThere's three things happening here.
p234
aVThe first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
p235
aVThe second is the efforts of our team.
p236
aVAnd third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
p237
aVNow, things have been going pretty well.
p238
aa(lp239
VObviously, there are times when things don't work out.
p240
aVGuests have thrown unauthorized parties
p241
aVand trashed homes.
p242
aVHosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
p243
aVIn the early days, I was customer service,
p244
aVand those calls came right to my cell phone.
p245
aVI was at the front lines of trust breaking.
p246
aVAnd there's nothing worse than those calls,
p247
aVit hurts to even think about them.
p248
aVAnd the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice
p249
aVwas and, I would say, still is
p250
aVour single greatest motivator to keep improving.
p251
aa(lp252
VThankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted,
p253
aVless than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.
p254
aVTurns out, people are justified in their trust.
p255
aVAnd when trust works out right,
p256
aVit can be absolutely magical.
p257
aa(lp258
VWe had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay,
p259
aVand he suffered a heart attack.
p260
aVThe host rushed him to the hospital.
p261
aVThey donated their own blood for his operation.
p262
aVLet me read you his review.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
V"Excellent house for sedentary travelers
p267
aVprone to myocardial infarctions.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VThe area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VJavier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels
p276
aVwho will save your life without even knowing you.
p277
aVThey will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying
p278
aVand stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.
p279
aVThey don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.
p280
aVAnd they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.
p281
aVHighly recommended!"
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VOf course, not every stay is like that.
p286
aVBut this connection beyond the transaction
p287
aVis exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, when I heard that term,
p290
aVI have to admit, it tripped me up.
p291
aVHow do sharing and transactions go together?
p292
aVSo let's be clear; it is about commerce.
p293
aVBut if you just called it the rental economy,
p294
aVit would be incomplete.
p295
aVThe sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.
p296
aVPeople share a part of themselves,
p297
aVand that changes everything.
p298
aa(lp299
VYou know how most travel today is, like,
p300
aVI think of it like fast food \u2014
p301
aVit's efficient and consistent,
p302
aVat the cost of local and authentic.
p303
aVWhat if travel were like a magnificent buffet
p304
aVof local experiences?
p305
aVWhat if anywhere you visited,
p306
aVthere was a central marketplace of locals
p307
aVoffering to get you thoroughly drunk
p308
aVon a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.
p309
aVOr learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
p310
aa(lp311
VToday, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.
p312
aVWhat if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?
p313
aVWhat would that look like?
p314
aVWhat if cities embraced a culture of sharing?
p315
aVI see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection
p316
aVinstead of isolation and separation.
p317
aa(lp318
VIn South Korea, in the city of Seoul,
p319
aVthey've actually even started this.
p320
aVThey've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots
p321
aVto be shared by residents.
p322
aVThey're connecting students who need a place to live
p323
aVwith empty-nesters who have extra rooms.
p324
aVAnd they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation
p325
aVof sharing economy start-ups.
p326
aa(lp327
VTonight, just on our service,
p328
aV785,000 people
p329
aVin 191 countries
p330
aVwill either stay in a stranger's home
p331
aVor welcome one into theirs.
p332
aVClearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.
p333
aa(lp334
VWe didn't invent anything new.
p335
aVHospitality has been around forever.
p336
aVThere's been many other websites like ours.
p337
aVSo, why did ours eventually take off?
p338
aVLuck and timing aside,
p339
aVI've learned that you can take the components of trust,
p340
aVand you can design for that.
p341
aVDesign can overcome our most deeply rooted
p342
aVstranger-danger bias.
p343
aVAnd that's amazing to me.
p344
aVIt blows my mind.
p345
aVI think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.
p348
aVBut if it can help out with this one,
p349
aVif it can make a dent in this,
p350
aVit makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.
