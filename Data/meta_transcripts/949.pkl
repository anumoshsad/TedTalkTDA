VWell, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.
p4
aVI started with that sentence about 12 years ago,
p5
aVand I started in the context
p6
aVof developing countries,
p7
aVbut you're sitting here from every corner of the world.
p8
aVSo if you think of a map of your country,
p9
aVI think you'll realize
p10
aVthat for every country on Earth,
p11
aVyou could draw little circles to say,
p12
aV"These are places where good teachers won't go."
p13
aVOn top of that,
p14
aVthose are the places from where trouble comes.
p15
aVSo we have an ironic problem \u2014
p16
aVgood teachers don't want to go
p17
aVto just those places where they're needed the most.
p18
aa(lp19
VI started in 1999
p20
aVto try and address this problem with an experiment,
p21
aVwhich was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
p22
aVI basically embedded a computer
p23
aVinto a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
p24
aVThe children barely went to school, they didn't know any English \u2014
p25
aVthey'd never seen a computer before,
p26
aVand they didn't know what the internet was.
p27
aVI connected high speed internet to it \u2014 it's about three feet off the ground \u2014
p28
aVturned it on and left it there.
p29
aVAfter this,
p30
aVwe noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
p31
aVBut I repeated this all over India
p32
aVand then through
p33
aVa large part of the world
p34
aVand noticed
p35
aVthat children will learn to do
p36
aVwhat they want to learn to do.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is the first experiment that we did \u2014
p39
aVeight year-old boy on your right
p40
aVteaching his student, a six year-old girl,
p41
aVand he was teaching her how to browse.
p42
aVThis boy here in the middle of central India \u2014
p43
aVthis is in a Rajasthan village,
p44
aVwhere the children recorded their own music
p45
aVand then played it back to each other
p46
aVand in the process,
p47
aVthey've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
p48
aVThey did all of this in four hours
p49
aVafter seeing the computer for the first time.
p50
aVIn another South Indian village,
p51
aVthese boys here
p52
aVhad assembled a video camera
p53
aVand were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
p54
aVThey downloaded it from Disney.com,
p55
aVor one of these websites,
p56
aV14 days after putting the computer in their village.
p57
aVSo at the end of it,
p58
aVwe concluded that groups of children
p59
aVcan learn to use computers and the internet on their own,
p60
aVirrespective of who
p61
aVor where they were.
p62
aa(lp63
VAt that point, I became a little more ambitious
p64
aVand decided to see
p65
aVwhat else could children do with a computer.
p66
aVWe started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,
p67
aVwhere I gave a group of children \u2014
p68
aVthey spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
p69
aVI gave them a computer
p70
aVwith a speech-to-text interface,
p71
aVwhich you now get free with Windows,
p72
aVand asked them to speak into it.
p73
aVSo when they spoke into it,
p74
aVthe computer typed out gibberish,
p75
aVso they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
p76
aVSo I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
p77
aVMake yourself understood
p78
aVto the computer."
p79
aVSo the children said, "How do we do that."
p80
aVAnd I said,
p81
aV"I don't know, actually."
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVAnd I left.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVTwo months later \u2014
p86
aVand this is now documented
p87
aVin the Information Technology
p88
aVfor International Development journal \u2014
p89
aVthat accents had changed
p90
aVand were remarkably close to the neutral British accent
p91
aVin which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
p92
aVIn other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVSo they could do that on their own.
p95
aVAfter that, I started to experiment
p96
aVwith various other things
p97
aVthat they might learn to do on their own.
p98
aa(lp99
VI got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,
p100
aVfrom the late Arthur C. Clarke,
p101
aVwho said, "I want to see what's going on."
p102
aVAnd he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
p103
aVHe said two interesting things,
p104
aV"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVThe second thing he said was that,
p107
aV"If children have interest,
p108
aVthen education happens."
p109
aVAnd I was doing that in the field,
p110
aVso every time I would watch it and think of him.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely
p113
aVhelp people,
p114
aVbecause children quickly learn to navigate
p115
aVthe web and find things which interest them.
p116
aVAnd when you've got interest, then you have education.
p117
aa(lp118
VSugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.
p119
aVThis is a 15 year-old boy.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games
p122
aVlike animals,
p123
aVand I listen to music.
p124
aa(lp125
VSM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
p126
aVAnd he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
p127
aVThis is in Cambodia,
p128
aVrural Cambodia \u2014
p129
aVa fairly silly arithmetic game,
p130
aVwhich no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
p131
aVThey would, you know, throw it back at you.
p132
aVThey'd say, "This is very boring."
p133
aVIf you leave it on the pavement
p134
aVand if all the adults go away,
p135
aVthen they will show off with each other
p136
aVabout what they can do.
p137
aVThis is what these children are doing.
p138
aVThey are trying to multiply, I think.
p139
aVAnd all over India,
p140
aVat the end of about two years,
p141
aVchildren were beginning to Google their homework.
p142
aVAs a result, the teachers reported
p143
aVtremendous improvements in their English \u2014
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVrapid improvement and all sorts of things.
p146
aVThey said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVAnd indeed they had.
p149
aVI mean, if there's stuff on Google,
p150
aVwhy would you need to stuff it into your head?
p151
aVSo at the end of the next four years,
p152
aVI decided that groups of children can navigate the internet
p153
aVto achieve educational objectives on their own.
p154
aa(lp155
VAt that time, a large amount of money
p156
aVhad come into Newcastle University
p157
aVto improve schooling in India.
p158
aVSo Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."
p159
aVThey said, "There's no way you're going to handle
p160
aVa million pounds-worth of University money
p161
aVsitting in Delhi."
p162
aVSo in 2006,
p163
aVI bought myself a heavy overcoat
p164
aVand moved to Newcastle.
p165
aVI wanted to test the limits
p166
aVof the system.
p167
aVThe first experiment I did out of Newcastle
p168
aVwas actually done in India.
p169
aVAnd I set myself and impossible target:
p170
aVcan Tamil speaking
p171
aV12-year-old children
p172
aVin a South Indian village
p173
aVteach themselves biotechnology
p174
aVin English on their own?
p175
aVAnd I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero \u2014
p176
aVI'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them \u2014
p177
aVthey get another zero,
p178
aVI'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."
p179
aa(lp180
VI called in 26 children.
p181
aVThey all came in there, and I told them
p182
aVthat there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.
p183
aVI wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.
p184
aVIt's all in English, and I'm going.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVSo I left them with it.
p187
aVI came back after two months,
p188
aVand the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
p189
aVI said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
p190
aVThey said, "Yes, we did."
p191
aV"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."
p192
aVSo I said,
p193
aV"Well, how long did you practice on it
p194
aVbefore you decided you understood nothing?"
p195
aVThey said, "We look at it every day."
p196
aVSo I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
p197
aVSo a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,
p198
aVliterally,
p199
aV"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule
p200
aVcauses genetic disease,
p201
aVwe've understood nothing else."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
V(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VIt took me three years to publish that.
p210
aVIt's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
p211
aVOne of the referees who refereed the paper said,
p212
aV"It's too good to be true,"
p213
aVwhich was not very nice.
p214
aVWell, one of the girls had taught herself
p215
aVto become the teacher.
p216
aVAnd then that's her over there.
p217
aVRemember, they don't study English.
p218
aVI edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
p219
aVand she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"
p220
aVand then she looked and did this.
p221
aVWhatever the expression, it was not very nice.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,
p224
aVwhich is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
p225
aVBut 30 percent is not a pass.
p226
aVSo I found that they had a friend,
p227
aVa local accountant, a young girl,
p228
aVand they played football with her.
p229
aVI asked that girl, "Would you teach them
p230
aVenough biotechnology to pass?"
p231
aVAnd she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."
p232
aVI said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
p233
aVShe said, "What's that?"
p234
aVI said, "Well, what you've got to do
p235
aVis stand behind them
p236
aVand admire them all the time.
p237
aVJust say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.
p238
aVWhat is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"
p239
aVShe did that for two months.
p240
aVThe scores went up to 50,
p241
aVwhich is what the posh schools of New Delhi,
p242
aVwith a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo I came back to Newcastle
p245
aVwith these results
p246
aVand decided
p247
aVthat there was something happening here
p248
aVthat definitely was getting very serious.
p249
aVSo, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,
p250
aVI came to the most remote place that I could think of.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVApproximately 5,000 miles from Delhi
p253
aVis the little town of Gateshead.
p254
aVIn Gateshead, I took 32 children
p255
aVand I started to fine-tune the method.
p256
aVI made them into groups of four.
p257
aVI said, "You make your own groups of four.
p258
aVEach group of four can use one computer and not four computers."
p259
aVRemember, from the Hole in the Wall.
p260
aV"You can exchange groups.
p261
aVYou can walk across to another group,
p262
aVif you don't like your group, etc.
p263
aVYou can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,
p264
aVcome back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
p265
aVAnd I explained to them
p266
aVthat, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VThe children enthusiastically got after me and said,
p273
aV"Now, what do you want us to do?"
p274
aVI gave them six GCSE questions.
p275
aVThe first group \u2014 the best one \u2014
p276
aVsolved everything in 20 minutes.
p277
aVThe worst, in 45.
p278
aVThey used everything that they knew \u2014
p279
aVnews groups, Google, Wikipedia,
p280
aVAsk Jeeves, etc.
p281
aVThe teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
p282
aVI said, "Well, let's try it.
p283
aVI'll come back after two months.
p284
aVWe'll give them a paper test \u2014
p285
aVno computers, no talking to each other, etc."
p286
aVThe average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups
p287
aVwas 76 percent.
p288
aVWhen I did the experiment, when I did the test,
p289
aVafter two months, the score
p290
aVwas 76 percent.
p291
aVThere was photographic recall
p292
aVinside the children,
p293
aVI suspect because they're discussing with each other.
p294
aVA single child in front of a single computer
p295
aVwill not do that.
p296
aVI have further results,
p297
aVwhich are almost unbelievable,
p298
aVof scores which go up with time.
p299
aVBecause their teachers say
p300
aVthat after the session is over,
p301
aVthe children continue to Google further.
p302
aa(lp303
VHere in Britain, I put out a call
p304
aVfor British grandmothers,
p305
aVafter my Kuppam experiment.
p306
aVWell, you know,
p307
aVthey're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.
p308
aV200 of them volunteered immediately.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVThe deal was that they would give me
p311
aVone hour of broadband time,
p312
aVsitting in their homes,
p313
aVone day in a week.
p314
aVSo they did that,
p315
aVand over the last two years,
p316
aVover 600 hours of instruction
p317
aVhas happened over Skype,
p318
aVusing what my students call the granny cloud.
p319
aVThe granny cloud sits over there.
p320
aVI can beam them to whichever school I want to.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.
p323
aVYou say it.
p324
aVYou can't catch me.
p325
aa(lp326
VChildren: You can't catch me.
p327
aa(lp328
VTeacher: I'm the gingerbread man.
p329
aa(lp330
VChildren: I'm the gingerbread man.
p331
aa(lp332
VTeacher: Well done. Very good ...
p333
aa(lp334
VSM: Back at Gateshead,
p335
aVa 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism
p336
aVin 15 minutes.
p337
aVYou know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
p338
aVTwo children watch a TEDTalk.
p339
aVThey wanted to be footballers before.
p340
aVAfter watching eight TEDTalks,
p341
aVhe wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VIt's pretty simple stuff.
p348
aa(lp349
VThis is what I'm building now \u2014
p350
aVthey're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
p351
aVThe furniture is designed
p352
aVso that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,
p353
aVbig broadband connections, but in groups.
p354
aVIf they want, they can call the granny cloud.
p355
aVThis is a SOLE in Newcastle.
p356
aVThe mediator is from Pune, India.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.
p359
aVI went to Turin in May.
p360
aVI sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
p361
aVI speak only English, they speak only Italian,
p362
aVso we had no way to communicate.
p363
aVI started writing English questions on the blackboard.
p364
aVThe children looked at it and said, "What?"
p365
aVI said, "Well, do it."
p366
aVThey typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,
p367
aVwent back into Italian Google.
p368
aVFifteen minutes later \u2014
p369
aVnext question: where is Calcutta?
p370
aVThis one, they took only 10 minutes.
p371
aVI tried a really hard one then.
p372
aVWho was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
p373
aVThere was silence for a while,
p374
aVthen they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
p375
aVIt's Pitagora."
p376
aVAnd then,
p377
aVin 20 minutes,
p378
aVthe right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
p379
aVThis sent shivers up my spine.
p380
aVThese are 10 year-olds.
p381
aVText: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
V(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VSM: So you know what's happened?
p388
aVI think we've just stumbled across
p389
aVa self-organizing system.
p390
aVA self-organizing system is one
p391
aVwhere a structure appears
p392
aVwithout explicit intervention from the outside.
p393
aVSelf-organizing systems also always show emergence,
p394
aVwhich is that the system starts to do things,
p395
aVwhich it was never designed for.
p396
aVWhich is why you react the way you do,
p397
aVbecause it looks impossible.
p398
aVI think I can make a guess now \u2014
p399
aVeducation is self-organizing system,
p400
aVwhere learning is an emergent phenomenon.
p401
aVIt'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,
p402
aVbut I'm going to try.
p403
aVBut in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
p404
aVOne billion children, we need 100 million mediators \u2014
p405
aVthere are many more than that on the planet \u2014
p406
aV10 million SOLEs,
p407
aV180 billion dollars and 10 years.
p408
aVWe could change everything.
