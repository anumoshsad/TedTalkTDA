VThis is a picture of a sunset on Mars
p4
aVtaken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.
p5
aVMars is a very cold planet,
p6
aVflooded with high levels of UV radiation
p7
aVand extremely dry.
p8
aVIn fact, Mars is considered to be too dry for life as we know it.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm an astrobiologist.
p11
aVI try to understand the origin of life on Earth
p12
aVand the possibilities of finding life
p13
aVelsewhere in the universe.
p14
aVPeople sometimes ask me,
p15
aVhow can you be an astrobiologist
p16
aVif you don't have your own spaceship?
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, what I do is that I study life
p19
aVin those environments on Earth
p20
aVthat most closely resemble other interesting places in the universe.
p21
aVAll life on Earth requires water,
p22
aVso in my case I focus on the intimate relationship
p23
aVbetween water and life
p24
aVin order to understand
p25
aVif we could find life in a planet as dry as Mars.
p26
aVBut since I do not have the 2.5 billion dollars
p27
aVto send my own robot to Mars,
p28
aVI study the most Martian place on Earth,
p29
aVthe Atacama Desert.
p30
aa(lp31
VLocated in northern Chile,
p32
aVit is the oldest and driest desert on Earth.
p33
aVTo give you an idea of how dry it is,
p34
aVconsider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.
p35
aVIn the Atacama, there are places with no reported rains
p36
aVin the last 400 years.
p37
aa(lp38
VHow do I know this?
p39
aVWell, because I was born and raised in the Atacama \u2014
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo I had a unique advantage
p44
aVwhen I started studying this desert.
p45
aVSo let me tell you guys a few fantastic examples
p46
aVhe has found
p47
aVon how life has adapted to live with almost no water at all.
p48
aa(lp49
VOne of my first findings was in the entrance of a cave
p50
aVfacing the Pacific Ocean.
p51
aVIn this place, we reported a new type of microalgae
p52
aVthat grew only on top of the spiderwebs that covered the cave entrance.
p53
aVHave you ever seen a spiderweb early in the morning?
p54
aVIt's covered with dew,
p55
aVso this microalgae learned that in order to carry photosynthesis
p56
aVin the coast of the driest desert on Earth,
p57
aVthey could use the spiderwebs.
p58
aVSo here they may access the water from the fogs
p59
aVthat regularly cover these areas in the morning.
p60
aa(lp61
VIn another cave, we found a different type of microalgae.
p62
aVThis one is able to use ocean mist as a source of water,
p63
aVand strikingly lives in the very bottom of a cave,
p64
aVso it has adapted to live with less than 0.1 percent
p65
aVof the amount of light that regular plants need.
p66
aVThese type of findings suggest to me that on Mars,
p67
aVwe may find even photosynthetic life inside caves.
p68
aVAnd by the way, that's me.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, for almost 15 years this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,
p73
aVwas thought to be the driest place of this desert,
p74
aVbut I knew that it was not.
p75
aVHow? You already know the answer.
p76
aVBecause I was born and raised in this desert.
p77
aVSo I remembered that I usually see fogs in Yungay,
p78
aVso after setting sensors in a number of places,
p79
aVwhere I remember never seeing fogs or clouds,
p80
aVI reported four other sites much drier than Yungay,
p81
aVwith this one, María Elena South,
p82
aVbeing the truly driest place on Earth,
p83
aVas dry as Mars,
p84
aVand amazingly, just a 15-minute ride
p85
aVfrom the small mining town where I was born.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, in this search, we were trying to actually find the dry limit
p88
aVfor life on Earth,
p89
aVa place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it.
p90
aVBut even here, well hidden underground,
p91
aVwe found a number of different microorganisms,
p92
aVwhich suggested to me that similarly dry places, like Mars,
p93
aVmay be in inhabited.
p94
aVWe even have some preliminary evidences
p95
aVthat these microorganisms may still be active
p96
aVin the desiccated state,
p97
aVlike walking mummies all around us,
p98
aVand that they may be using UV radiation as a source of energy.
p99
aVIf confirmed, this would have a huge impact on our definition of life,
p100
aVon how we look for life elsewhere in the universe.
p101
aa(lp102
VDue to its clear skies, by 2020,
p103
aV60 percent of the biggest telescopes on Earth
p104
aVwill be located in the Atacama,
p105
aVand while everyone else will be looking among the stars
p106
aVto answer the question, "Are we alone?"
p107
aVI will be looking down to the ground
p108
aVsearching for this same answer
p109
aVin my own backyard.
p110
aa(lp111
VThank you.
