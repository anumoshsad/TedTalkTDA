VI'm going to talk today about saving more,
p4
aVbut not today, tomorrow.
p5
aVI'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.
p6
aVIt's a program that Richard Thaler
p7
aVfrom the University of Chicago and I
p8
aVdevised maybe 15 years ago.
p9
aVThe program, in a sense,
p10
aVis an example of behavioral finance
p11
aVon steroids \u2014
p12
aVhow we could really use behavioral finance.
p13
aVNow you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
p14
aVSo let's think about how we manage our money.
p15
aVLet's start with mortgages.
p16
aVIt's kind of a recent topic,
p17
aVat least in the U.S.
p18
aVA lot of people buy
p19
aVthe biggest house they can afford,
p20
aVand actually slightly bigger than that.
p21
aVAnd then they foreclose.
p22
aVAnd then they blame the banks
p23
aVfor being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.
p24
aa(lp25
VLet's also think about
p26
aVhow we manage risks \u2014
p27
aVfor example, investing in the stock market.
p28
aVTwo years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,
p29
aVmarkets did well.
p30
aVWe were risk takers, of course.
p31
aVThen market stocks seize
p32
aVand we're like, "Wow.
p33
aVThese losses, they feel, emotionally,
p34
aVthey feel very different
p35
aVfrom what we actually thought about it
p36
aVwhen markets were going up."
p37
aVSo we're probably not doing a great job
p38
aVwhen it comes to risk taking.
p39
aa(lp40
VHow many of you have iPhones?
p41
aVAnyone? Wonderful.
p42
aVI would bet many more of you
p43
aVinsure your iPhone \u2014
p44
aVyou're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.
p45
aVWhat if you lose your iPhone?
p46
aVWhat if you do this?
p47
aVHow many of you have kids?
p48
aVAnyone?
p49
aVKeep your hands up
p50
aVif you have sufficient life insurance.
p51
aVI see a lot of hands coming down.
p52
aVI would predict,
p53
aVif you're a representative sample,
p54
aVthat many more of you
p55
aVinsure your iPhones than your lives,
p56
aVeven when you have kids.
p57
aVWe're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe average American household
p60
aVspends 1,000 dollars a year
p61
aVon lotteries.
p62
aVAnd I know it sounds crazy.
p63
aVHow many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?
p64
aVNo one.
p65
aVSo that tells us that the people not in this room
p66
aVare spending more than a thousand
p67
aVto get the average to a thousand.
p68
aVLow-income people
p69
aVspend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.
p70
aVSo where does it take us?
p71
aVWe're not doing a great job managing money.
p72
aa(lp73
VBehavioral finance is really a combination
p74
aVof psychology and economics,
p75
aVtrying to understand
p76
aVthe money mistakes people make.
p77
aVAnd I can keep standing here
p78
aVfor the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left
p79
aVand make fun of all sorts of ways
p80
aVwe manage money,
p81
aVand at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"
p82
aVAnd that's what I really want to focus on today.
p83
aVHow do we take an understanding
p84
aVof the money mistakes people make,
p85
aVand then turning the behavioral challenges
p86
aVinto behavioral solutions?
p87
aVAnd what I'm going to talk about today
p88
aVis Save More Tomorrow.
p89
aa(lp90
VI want to address the issue
p91
aVof savings.
p92
aVWe have on the screen
p93
aVa representative sample
p94
aVof 100 Americans.
p95
aVAnd we're going to look at their saving behavior.
p96
aVFirst thing to notice is,
p97
aVhalf of them
p98
aVdo not even have access
p99
aVto a 401(k) plan.
p100
aVThey cannot make savings easy.
p101
aVThey cannot have money go away from their paycheck
p102
aVinto a 401(k) plan
p103
aVbefore they see it,
p104
aVbefore they can touch it.
p105
aVWhat about the remaining half of the people?
p106
aVSome of them elect not to save.
p107
aVThey're just too lazy.
p108
aVThey never get around to logging into a complicated website
p109
aVand doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.
p110
aVAnd then they have to decide how they're going to invest
p111
aVin their 52 choices,
p112
aVand they never heard about what is a money market fund.
p113
aVAnd they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.
p114
aVHow many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?
p115
aVOne third of Americans.
p116
aVTwo thirds are not saving now.
p117
aa(lp118
VAre they saving enough?
p119
aVTake out those
p120
aVwho say they save too little.
p121
aVOne out of 10
p122
aVare saving enough.
p123
aVNine out of 10
p124
aVeither cannot save through their 401(k) plan,
p125
aVdecide not to save \u2014 or don't decide \u2014
p126
aVor save too little.
p127
aVWe think we have a problem
p128
aVof people saving too much.
p129
aVLet's look at that.
p130
aVWe have one person \u2014
p131
aVwell, actually we're going to slice him in half
p132
aVbecause it's less than one percent.
p133
aVRoughly half a percent of Americans
p134
aVfeel that they save too much.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhat are we going to do about it?
p137
aVThat's what I really want to focus on.
p138
aVWe have to understand
p139
aVwhy people are not saving,
p140
aVand then we can hopefully flip
p141
aVthe behavioral challenges
p142
aVinto behavioral solutions,
p143
aVand then see how powerful it might be.
p144
aVSo let me divert for a second
p145
aVas we're going to identify the problems,
p146
aVthe challenges, the behavioral challenges,
p147
aVthat prevent people from saving.
p148
aVI'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.
p149
aa(lp150
VSuppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.
p151
aVAnd during the break
p152
aVthere would be a snack
p153
aVand you could choose bananas or chocolate.
p154
aVHow many of you think you would like to have bananas
p155
aVduring this hypothetical TED event next week?
p156
aVWho would go for bananas?
p157
aVWonderful.
p158
aVI predict scientifically
p159
aV74 percent of you will go for bananas.
p160
aVWell that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.
p161
aVAnd then count down the days
p162
aVand see what people ended up eating.
p163
aVThe same people that imagined themselves
p164
aVeating the bananas
p165
aVended up eating chocolates
p166
aVa week later.
p167
aa(lp168
VSelf-control
p169
aVis not a problem in the future.
p170
aVIt's only a problem now
p171
aVwhen the chocolate is next to us.
p172
aVWhat does it have to do with time and savings,
p173
aVthis issue of immediate gratification?
p174
aVOr as some economists call it, present bias.
p175
aVWe think about saving. We know we should be saving.
p176
aVWe know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.
p177
aVChristmas is coming,
p178
aVwe might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.
p179
aVSo this issue of present bias
p180
aVcauses us to think about saving,
p181
aVbut end up spending.
p182
aa(lp183
VLet me now talk
p184
aVabout another behavioral obstacle to saving
p185
aVhaving to do with inertia.
p186
aVBut again, a little diversion
p187
aVto the topic of organ donation.
p188
aVWonderful study comparing different countries.
p189
aVWe're going to look at two similar countries,
p190
aVGermany and Austria.
p191
aVAnd in Germany,
p192
aVif you would like to donate your organs \u2014
p193
aVGod forbid something really bad
p194
aVhappens to you \u2014
p195
aVwhen you get your driving license or an I.D.,
p196
aVyou check the box saying,
p197
aV"I would like to donate my organs."
p198
aVNot many people like checking boxes.
p199
aVIt takes effort. You need to think.
p200
aVTwelve percent do.
p201
aVAustria, a neighboring country,
p202
aVslightly similar, slightly different.
p203
aVWhat's the difference?
p204
aVWell, you still have choice.
p205
aVYou will decide
p206
aVwhether you want to donate your organs or not.
p207
aVBut when you get your driving license,
p208
aVyou check the box
p209
aVif you do not want to donate your organ.
p210
aVNobody checks boxes.
p211
aVThat's kind of too much effort.
p212
aVOne percent check the box. The rest do nothing.
p213
aVDoing nothing is very common.
p214
aVNot many people check boxes.
p215
aa(lp216
VWhat are the implications
p217
aVto saving lives
p218
aVand having organs available?
p219
aVIn Germany, 12 percent check the box.
p220
aVTwelve percent are organ donors.
p221
aVHuge shortage of organs,
p222
aVGod forbid, if you need one.
p223
aVIn Austria, again, nobody checks the box.
p224
aVTherefore, 99 percent of people
p225
aVare organ donors.
p226
aVInertia, lack of action.
p227
aVWhat is the default setting
p228
aVif people do nothing,
p229
aVif they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?
p230
aVVery powerful.
p231
aVWe're going to talk
p232
aVabout what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared
p233
aVto make their 401(k) choices.
p234
aVAre we going to make them automatically join the plan,
p235
aVor are they going to be left out?
p236
aVIn too many 401(k) plans,
p237
aVif people do nothing,
p238
aVit means they're not saving for retirement,
p239
aVif they don't check the box.
p240
aVAnd checking the box takes effort.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.
p243
aVOne more before we flip the challenges into solutions,
p244
aVhaving to do with monkeys and apples.
p245
aVNo, no, no, this is a real study
p246
aVand it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.
p247
aVOne group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.
p248
aVThe other group gets two apples, one is taken away.
p249
aVThey still have an apple left.
p250
aVThey're really mad.
p251
aVWhy have you taken our apple?
p252
aVThis is the notion of loss aversion.
p253
aVWe hate losing stuff,
p254
aVeven if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.
p255
aVYou would hate to go to the ATM,
p256
aVtake out 100 dollars
p257
aVand notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.
p258
aVIt's very painful,
p259
aVeven though it doesn't mean anything.
p260
aVThose 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.
p261
aVSo this notion of loss aversion
p262
aVkicks in when it comes to savings too,
p263
aVbecause people, mentally
p264
aVand emotionally and intuitively
p265
aVframe savings as a loss
p266
aVbecause I have to cut my spending.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo we talked about
p269
aVall sorts of behavioral challenges
p270
aVhaving to do with savings eventually.
p271
aVWhether you think about immediate gratification,
p272
aVand the chocolates versus bananas,
p273
aVit's just painful to save now.
p274
aVIt's a lot more fun
p275
aVto spend now.
p276
aVWe talked about inertia and organ donations
p277
aVand checking the box.
p278
aVIf people have to check a lot of boxes
p279
aVto join a 401(k) plan,
p280
aVthey're going to keep procrastinating
p281
aVand not join.
p282
aVAnd last, we talked about loss aversion,
p283
aVand the monkeys and the apples.
p284
aVIf people frame mentally
p285
aVsaving for retirement as a loss,
p286
aVthey're not going to be saving for retirement.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo we've got these challenges,
p289
aVand what Richard Thaler and I
p290
aVwere always fascinated by \u2014
p291
aVtake behavioral finance,
p292
aVmake it behavioral finance on steroids
p293
aVor behavioral finance 2.0
p294
aVor behavioral finance in action \u2014
p295
aVflip the challenges into solutions.
p296
aVAnd we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution
p297
aVcalled Save More, not today, Tomorrow.
p298
aVHow is it going to solve the challenges
p299
aVwe chatted about?
p300
aVIf you think about the problem
p301
aVof bananas versus chocolates,
p302
aVwe think we're going to eat bananas next week.
p303
aVWe think we're going to save more next year.
p304
aVSave More Tomorrow
p305
aVinvites employees
p306
aVto save more maybe next year \u2014
p307
aVsometime in the future
p308
aVwhen we can imagine ourselves
p309
aVeating bananas,
p310
aVvolunteering more in the community,
p311
aVexercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow we also talked about checking the box
p314
aVand the difficulty of taking action.
p315
aVSave More Tomorrow
p316
aVmakes it easy.
p317
aVIt's an autopilot.
p318
aVOnce you tell me you would like to save more in the future,
p319
aVlet's say every January
p320
aVyou're going to be saving more automatically
p321
aVand it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan
p322
aVbefore you see it, before you touch it,
p323
aVbefore you get the issue
p324
aVof immediate gratification.
p325
aVBut what are we going to do about the monkeys
p326
aVand loss aversion?
p327
aVNext January comes
p328
aVand people might feel that if they save more,
p329
aVthey have to spend less, and that's painful.
p330
aVWell, maybe it shouldn't be just January.
p331
aVMaybe we should make people save more
p332
aVwhen they make more money.
p333
aVThat way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,
p334
aVthey don't have to cut their spending.
p335
aVThey take a little bit
p336
aVof the increase in the paycheck home
p337
aVand spend more \u2014
p338
aVtake a little bit of the increase
p339
aVand put it in a 401(k) plan.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo that is the program,
p342
aVembarrassingly simple,
p343
aVbut as we're going to see,
p344
aVextremely powerful.
p345
aVWe first implemented it,
p346
aVRichard Thaler and I,
p347
aVback in 1998.
p348
aVMid-sized company in the Midwest,
p349
aVblue collar employees
p350
aVstruggling to pay their bills
p351
aVrepeatedly told us
p352
aVthey cannot save more right away.
p353
aVSaving more today is not an option.
p354
aVWe invited them to save
p355
aVthree percentage points more
p356
aVevery time they get a pay raise.
p357
aVAnd here are the results.
p358
aVWe're seeing here a three and a half-year period,
p359
aVfour pay raises,
p360
aVpeople who were struggling to save,
p361
aVwere saving three percent of their paycheck,
p362
aVthree and a half years later
p363
aVsaving almost four times as much,
p364
aValmost 14 percent.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd there's shoes and bicycles
p367
aVand things on this chart
p368
aVbecause I don't want to just throw numbers
p369
aVin a vacuum.
p370
aVI want, really, to think about the fact
p371
aVthat saving four times more
p372
aVis a huge difference
p373
aVin terms of the lifestyle
p374
aVthat people will be able to afford.
p375
aVIt's real.
p376
aVIt's not just numbers on a piece of paper.
p377
aVWhereas with saving three percent,
p378
aVpeople might have to add nice sneakers
p379
aVso they can walk,
p380
aVbecause they won't be able to afford anything else,
p381
aVwhen they save 14 percent
p382
aVthey might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes
p383
aVto walk to the car to drive.
p384
aVThis is a real difference.
p385
aVBy now, about 60 percent of the large companies
p386
aVactually have programs like this in place.
p387
aVIt's been part of the Pension Protection Act.
p388
aVAnd needless to say that Thaler and I
p389
aVhave been blessed to be part of this program
p390
aVand make a difference.
p391
aa(lp392
VLet me wrap
p393
aVwith two key messages.
p394
aVOne is behavioral finance
p395
aVis extremely powerful.
p396
aVThis is just one example.
p397
aVMessage two
p398
aVis there's still a lot to do.
p399
aVThis is really the tip of the iceberg.
p400
aVIf you think about people and mortgages
p401
aVand buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,
p402
aVwe need to think about that.
p403
aVIf you're thinking about people taking too much risk
p404
aVand not understanding how much risk they're taking
p405
aVor taking too little risk,
p406
aVwe need to think about that.
p407
aVIf you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year
p408
aVon lottery tickets,
p409
aVwe need to think about that.
p410
aVThe average actually,
p411
aVthe record is in Singapore.
p412
aVThe average household
p413
aVspends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.
p414
aVWe've got a lot to do,
p415
aVa lot to solve,
p416
aValso in the retirement area
p417
aVwhen it comes to what people do with their money
p418
aVafter retirement.
p419
aa(lp420
VOne last question:
p421
aVHow many of you feel comfortable
p422
aVthat as you're planning for retirement
p423
aVyou have a really solid plan
p424
aVwhen you're going to retire,
p425
aVwhen you're going to claim Social Security benefits,
p426
aVwhat lifestyle to expect,
p427
aVhow much to spend every month
p428
aVso you're not going to run out of money?
p429
aVHow many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future
p430
aVwhen it comes to post-retirement decisions.
p431
aVOne, two, three, four.
p432
aVLess than three percent
p433
aVof a very sophisticated audience.
p434
aVBehavioral finance has a long way.
p435
aVThere's a lot of opportunities
p436
aVto make it powerful again and again and again.
p437
