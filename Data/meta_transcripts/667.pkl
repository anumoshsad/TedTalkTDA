VAll buildings today have something in common.
p4
aVThey're made using Victorian technologies.
p5
aVThis involves blueprints,
p6
aVindustrial manufacturing
p7
aVand construction using teams of workers.
p8
aVAll of this effort results in an inert object.
p9
aVAnd that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy
p10
aVfrom our environment into our homes and cities.
p11
aVThis is not sustainable.
p12
aVI believe that the only way that it is possible for us
p13
aVto construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities
p14
aVis by connecting them to nature,
p15
aVnot insulating them from it.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
p18
aVLiving systems are in constant conversation
p19
aVwith the natural world,
p20
aVthrough sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
p21
aVAnd this is the conversion of one group of substances
p22
aVinto another, either through
p23
aVthe production or the absorption of energy.
p24
aVAnd this is the way in which living materials
p25
aVmake the most of their local resources
p26
aVin a sustainable way.
p27
aVSo, I'm interested in the use of
p28
aVmetabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
p29
aVBut they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
p30
aa(lp31
VI'm working with architect Neil Spiller
p32
aVat the Bartlett School of Architecture,
p33
aVand we're collaborating with international scientists
p34
aVin order to generate these new materials
p35
aVfrom a bottom up approach.
p36
aVThat means we're generating them from scratch.
p37
aVOne of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,
p38
aVand he's really interested in the transition from
p39
aVinert to living matter.
p40
aVNow, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,
p41
aVwhen we're thinking about sustainable materials.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
p44
aVNow all this is \u2014 and it's magic \u2014
p45
aVis a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
p46
aVAnd it has no DNA.
p47
aVThis little bag is able to conduct itself
p48
aVin a way that can only be described as living.
p49
aVIt is able to move around its environment.
p50
aVIt can follow chemical gradients.
p51
aVIt can undergo complex reactions,
p52
aVsome of which are happily architectural.
p53
aVSo here we are. These are protocells,
p54
aVpatterning their environment.
p55
aVWe don't know how they do that yet.
p56
aVHere, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
p57
aVNow, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
p58
aVThis is a violent process.
p59
aa(lp60
VHere, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide
p61
aVout of the atmosphere
p62
aVand turn it into carbonate.
p63
aVAnd that's the shell around that globular fat.
p64
aVThey are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
p65
aVSo what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies
p66
aVtowards creating bottom-up construction approaches
p67
aVfor architecture,
p68
aVwhich contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods
p69
aVwhich impose structure upon matter.
p70
aVThat can't be energetically sensible.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, bottom-up materials
p73
aVactually exist today.
p74
aVThey've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
p75
aVIf you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,
p76
aVand have a look at the brickwork,
p77
aVwhich I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,
p78
aVyou'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
p79
aVAnd if you look even closer,
p80
aVyou'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells
p81
aVand little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
p82
aVAnd then they are fossilized over millions of years.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow a block of limestone, in itself,
p85
aVisn't particularly that interesting.
p86
aVIt looks beautiful.
p87
aVBut imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be
p88
aVif the surfaces were actually
p89
aVin conversation with the atmosphere.
p90
aVMaybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
p91
aVWould it give this block of limestone new properties?
p92
aVWell, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
p93
aVIt might be able to self-repair, and even respond
p94
aVto dramatic changes
p95
aVin the immediate environment.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, architects are never happy
p98
aVwith just one block of an interesting material.
p99
aVThey think big. Okay?
p100
aVSo when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,
p101
aVwe can start thinking about ecological interventions
p102
aVlike repair of atolls,
p103
aVor reclamation of parts of a city
p104
aVthat are damaged by water.
p105
aVSo, one of these examples
p106
aVwould of course be the historic city of Venice.
p107
aVNow, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,
p108
aVand is built upon wooden piles.
p109
aVSo we've devised a way by which it may be possible
p110
aVfor the protocell technology that we're working with
p111
aVto sustainably reclaim Venice.
p112
aVAnd architect Christian Kerrigan
p113
aVhas come up with a series of designs that show us
p114
aVhow it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef
p115
aVunderneath the city.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, here is the technology we have today.
p118
aVThis is our protocell technology,
p119
aVeffectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,
p120
aVand depositing it in a very complex environment,
p121
aVagainst natural materials.
p122
aVWe're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
p123
aVNow, this is the very interesting part.
p124
aVWe don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
p125
aVWhat we need it to do is to be
p126
aVcreatively crafted around the wooden piles.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually
p129
aVmoving away from the light,
p130
aVtoward the dark foundations.
p131
aVWe've observed this in the laboratory.
p132
aVThe protocells can actually move away from the light.
p133
aVThey can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
p134
aVSo that these don't just exist as one entity,
p135
aVwe kind of chemically engineer them.
p136
aVAnd so here the protocells are depositing their limestone
p137
aVvery specifically, around the foundations of Venice,
p138
aVeffectively petrifying it.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
p141
aVIt's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology
p142
aVin order for us to become ready
p143
aVto test it out in a case-by-case basis
p144
aVon the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
p145
aVBut gradually, as the buildings are repaired,
p146
aVwe will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
p147
aVAn accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
p148
aVAlso it will attract the local marine ecology,
p149
aVwho will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture
p152
aVthat connects a city to the natural world
p153
aVin a very direct and immediate way.
p154
aVBut perhaps the most exciting thing about it
p155
aVis that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
p156
aVThis is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,
p157
aVwhich means that this technology is just as appropriate
p158
aVfor developing countries as it is
p159
aVfor First World countries.
p160
aVSo, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials
p161
aVas a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,
p162
aVand building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
p163
aa(lp164
VSecondly, these metabolic materials
p165
aVhave some of the properties of living systems,
p166
aVwhich means they can perform in similar ways.
p167
aVThey can expect to have a lot of forms and functions
p168
aVwithin the practice of architecture.
p169
aVAnd finally, an observer in the future
p170
aVmarveling at a beautiful structure in the environment
p171
aVmay find it almost impossible to tell
p172
aVwhether this structure
p173
aVhas been created by a natural process
p174
aVor an artificial one.
p175
aVThank you.
