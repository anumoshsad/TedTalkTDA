VI recently retired
p4
aVfrom the California Highway Patrol
p5
aVafter 23 years of service.
p6
aVThe majority of those 23 years
p7
aVwas spent patrolling the southern end
p8
aVof Marin County,
p9
aVwhich includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
p10
aVThe bridge is an iconic structure,
p11
aVknown worldwide
p12
aVfor its beautiful views of San Francisco,
p13
aVthe Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
p14
aa(lp15
VUnfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,
p16
aVbeing one of the most utilized sites in the world.
p17
aVThe Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
p18
aVJoseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge,
p19
aVwas quoted as saying,
p20
aV"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.
p21
aVSuicide from the bridge
p22
aVis neither practical nor probable."
p23
aVBut since its opening,
p24
aVover 1,600 people have leapt to their death
p25
aVfrom that bridge.
p26
aVSome believe that traveling
p27
aVbetween the two towers
p28
aVwill lead you to another dimension \u2014
p29
aVthis bridge has been romanticized as such \u2014
p30
aVthat the fall from that
p31
aVfrees you from all your worries and grief,
p32
aVand the waters below
p33
aVwill cleanse your soul.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut let me tell you what actually occurs
p36
aVwhen the bridge is used
p37
aVas a means of suicide.
p38
aVAfter a free fall of four to five seconds,
p39
aVthe body strikes the water
p40
aVat about 75 miles an hour.
p41
aVThat impact shatters bones,
p42
aVsome of which then puncture vital organs.
p43
aVMost die on impact.
p44
aVThose that don't
p45
aVgenerally flail in the water helplessly,
p46
aVand then drown.
p47
aVI don't think that those who contemplate
p48
aVthis method of suicide
p49
aVrealize how grisly a death that they will face.
p50
aVThis is the cord.
p51
aVExcept for around the two towers,
p52
aVthere is 32 inches of steel
p53
aVparalleling the bridge.
p54
aVThis is where most folks stand
p55
aVbefore taking their lives.
p56
aVI can tell you from experience
p57
aVthat once the person is on that cord,
p58
aVand at their darkest time,
p59
aVit is very difficult to bring them back.
p60
aVI took this photo last year
p61
aVas this young woman spoke to an officer
p62
aVcontemplating her life.
p63
aVI want to tell you very happily
p64
aVthat we were successful that day
p65
aVin getting her back over the rail.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen I first began working on the bridge,
p68
aVwe had no formal training.
p69
aVYou struggled to funnel your way through these calls.
p70
aVThis was not only a disservice
p71
aVto those contemplating suicide,
p72
aVbut to the officers as well.
p73
aVWe've come a long, long way since then.
p74
aVNow, veteran officers and psychologists
p75
aVtrain new officers.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is Jason Garber.
p78
aVI met Jason on July 22 of last year
p79
aVwhen I get received a call
p80
aVof a possible suicidal subject
p81
aVsitting on the cord near midspan.
p82
aVI responded, and when I arrived,
p83
aVI observed Jason
p84
aVspeaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
p85
aVJason was just 32 years old
p86
aVand had flown out here from New Jersey.
p87
aVAs a matter of fact,
p88
aVhe had flown out here on two other occasions
p89
aVfrom New Jersey
p90
aVto attempt suicide on this bridge.
p91
aVAfter about an hour of speaking with Jason,
p92
aVhe asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
p93
aVRecalling your Greek mythology,
p94
aVZeus created Pandora,
p95
aVand sent her down to Earth with a box,
p96
aVand told her, "Never, ever open that box."
p97
aVWell one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,
p98
aVand she did open the box.
p99
aVOut flew plagues, sorrows,
p100
aVand all sorts of evils against man.
p101
aVThe only good thing in the box was hope.
p102
aVJason then asked us,
p103
aV"What happens when you open the box
p104
aVand hope isn't there?"
p105
aVHe paused a few moments,
p106
aVleaned to his right,
p107
aVand was gone.
p108
aVThis kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey
p109
aVhad just committed suicide.
p110
aa(lp111
VI spoke with Jason's parents that evening,
p112
aVand I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,
p113
aVthat I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,
p114
aVbecause that very next day,
p115
aVtheir family rabbi called to check on me.
p116
aVJason's parents had asked him to do so.
p117
aVThe collateral damage of suicide
p118
aVaffects so many people.
p119
aa(lp120
VI pose these questions to you:
p121
aVWhat would you do if your family member,
p122
aVfriend or loved one was suicidal?
p123
aVWhat would you say?
p124
aVWould you know what to say?
p125
aVIn my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,
p126
aVbut the listening.
p127
aVListen to understand.
p128
aVDon't argue, blame,
p129
aVor tell the person you know how they feel,
p130
aVbecause you probably don't.
p131
aVBy just being there,
p132
aVyou may just be the turning point that they need.
p133
aVIf you think someone is suicidal,
p134
aVdon't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.
p135
aVOne way of asking them the question is like this:
p136
aV"Others in similar circumstances
p137
aVhave thought about ending their life;
p138
aVhave you had these thoughts?"
p139
aVConfronting the person head-on
p140
aVmay just save their life and be the turning point for them.
p141
aVSome other signs to look for:
p142
aVhopelessness, believing that things are terrible
p143
aVand never going to get better;
p144
aVhelplessness, believing that there is nothing
p145
aVthat you can do about it;
p146
aVrecent social withdrawal;
p147
aVand a loss of interest in life.
p148
aa(lp149
VI came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,
p150
aVand I received an email from a lady
p151
aVthat I'd like to read you her letter.
p152
aVShe lost her son on January 19 of this year,
p153
aVand she wrote this me this email
p154
aVjust a couple of days ago,
p155
aVand it's with her permission and blessing
p156
aVthat I read this to you.
p157
aa(lp158
V"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
p159
aVThat must be quite the experience to be there.
p160
aVI'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.
p161
aVJust wanted to drop you a note.
p162
aVHope you get the word out to many people
p163
aVand they go home talking about it
p164
aVto their friends who tell their friends, etc.
p165
aVI'm still pretty numb,
p166
aVbut noticing more moments of really realizing
p167
aVMike isn't coming home.
p168
aVMike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco
p169
aVto watch the 49ers game with his father
p170
aVon January 19.
p171
aVHe never made it there.
p172
aVI called Petaluma police
p173
aVand reported him missing that evening.
p174
aVThe next morning,
p175
aVtwo officers came to my home
p176
aVand reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.
p177
aVA witness had observed him jumping off the bridge
p178
aVat 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
p179
aVThanks so much
p180
aVfor standing up for those
p181
aVwho may be only temporarily too weak
p182
aVto stand for themselves.
p183
aVWho hasn't been low before
p184
aVwithout suffering from a true mental illness?
p185
aVIt shouldn't be so easy to end it.
p186
aVMy prayers are with you for your fight.
p187
aVThe GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,
p188
aVis supposed to be a passage across
p189
aVour beautiful bay,
p190
aVnot a graveyard.
p191
aVGood luck this week. Vicky."
p192
aa(lp193
VI can't imagine the courage it takes for her
p194
aVto go down to that bridge and walk the path
p195
aVthat her son took that day,
p196
aVand also the courage just to carry on.
p197
aa(lp198
VI'd like to introduce you to a man
p199
aVI refer to as hope and courage.
p200
aVOn March 11 of 2005,
p201
aVI responded to a radio call of a possible
p202
aVsuicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk
p203
aVnear the north tower.
p204
aVI rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk
p205
aVand observed this man, Kevin Berthia,
p206
aVstanding on the sidewalk.
p207
aVWhen he saw me, he immediately traversed
p208
aVthat pedestrian rail,
p209
aVand stood on that small pipe
p210
aVwhich goes around the tower.
p211
aVFor the next hour and a half,
p212
aVI listened as Kevin spoke about
p213
aVhis depression and hopelessness.
p214
aVKevin decided on his own that day
p215
aVto come back over that rail
p216
aVand give life another chance.
p217
aVWhen Kevin came back over,
p218
aVI congratulated him.
p219
aV"This is a new beginning, a new life."
p220
aVBut I asked him, "What was it
p221
aVthat made you come back
p222
aVand give hope and life another chance?"
p223
aVAnd you know what he told me?
p224
aVHe said, "You listened.
p225
aVYou let me speak, and you just listened."
p226
aa(lp227
VShortly after this incident,
p228
aVI received a letter from Kevin's mother,
p229
aVand I have that letter with me,
p230
aVand I'd like to read it to you.
p231
aa(lp232
V"Dear Mr. Briggs,
p233
aVNothing will erase the events of March 11,
p234
aVbut you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
p235
aVI truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
p236
aVHe has been diagnosed with a mental illness
p237
aVfor which he has been properly medicated.
p238
aVI adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,
p239
aVcompletely unaware of any hereditary traits,
p240
aVbut, thank God, now we know.
p241
aVKevin is straight, as he says.
p242
aVWe truly thank God for you.
p243
aVSincerely indebted to you,
p244
aVNarvella Berthia."
p245
aVAnd on the bottom she writes,
p246
aV"P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening,
p247
aVyou were listed as the patient.
p248
aVBoy, did I have to straighten that one out."
p249
aa(lp250
VToday, Kevin is a loving father
p251
aVand contributing member of society.
p252
aVHe speaks openly
p253
aVabout the events that day and his depression
p254
aVin the hopes that his story
p255
aVwill inspire others.
p256
aa(lp257
VSuicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
p258
aVIt's personal.
p259
aVMy grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
p260
aVThat act, although ending his own pain,
p261
aVrobbed me from ever getting to know him.
p262
aVThis is what suicide does.
p263
aVFor most suicidal folks,
p264
aVor those contemplating suicide,
p265
aVthey wouldn't think of hurting another person.
p266
aVThey just want their own pain to end.
p267
aVTypically, this is accomplished in just three ways:
p268
aVsleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
p269
aVIn my career, I've responded to
p270
aVand been involved in hundreds
p271
aVof mental illness and suicide calls
p272
aVaround the bridge.
p273
aVOf those incidents I've been directly involved with,
p274
aVI've only lost two,
p275
aVbut that's two too many.
p276
aVOne was Jason.
p277
aVThe other was a man I spoke to
p278
aVfor about an hour.
p279
aVDuring that time, he shook my hand
p280
aVon three occasions.
p281
aVOn that final handshake,
p282
aVhe looked at me, and he said,
p283
aV"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
p284
aVAnd he leapt.
p285
aVHorrible, absolutely horrible.
p286
aa(lp287
VI do want to tell you, though,
p288
aVthe vast majority of folks
p289
aVthat we do get to contact on that bridge
p290
aVdo not commit suicide.
p291
aVAdditionally, that very few
p292
aVwho have jumped off the bridge and lived
p293
aVand can talk about it,
p294
aVthat one to two percent,
p295
aVmost of those folks have said
p296
aVthat the second that they let go of that rail,
p297
aVthey knew that they had made a mistake
p298
aVand they wanted to live.
p299
aVI tell people, the bridge not only connects
p300
aVMarin to San Francisco,
p301
aVbut people together also.
p302
aVThat connection, or bridge that we make,
p303
aVis something that each and every one of us
p304
aVshould strive to do.
p305
aVSuicide is preventable.
p306
aVThere is help. There is hope.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you very much.
