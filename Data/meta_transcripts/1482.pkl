VAs a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.
p4
aVAnd one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the
p5
aVearly part of the 20th century.
p6
aVIt used mirrors
p7
aVto create the illusion of tiny people
p8
aVperforming on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,
p9
aVbut this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.
p10
aVSo let the story begin.
p11
aa(lp12

p22
aa(lp23

p24
aa(lp25
VMarco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
p26
aVWhen a word was mentioned,
p27
aVan image of it
p28
aVinstantly appeared in his mind.
p29
aVTree. Chair. Girl.
p30
aVThey were hallucinations, which vanished
p31
aVthe moment he touched them.
p32
aVProbably a form of synesthesia.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut it was something
p35
aVhe later turned to his advantage.
p36
aVWhere other scientists would play in their laboratory,
p37
aVTesla created his inventions in his mind.
p38
aa(lp39
VNT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.
p40
aa(lp41
VMT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination,
p42
aVhe would build them in his workshop.
p43
aa(lp44
VNT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.
p45
aVI could picture them as real in my mind,
p46
aVand there I run it, test it and improve it.
p47
aVOnly then do I construct it.
p48
aa(lp49
VMT: His great idea
p50
aVwas alternating current.
p51
aVBut how could he convince the public that
p52
aVthe millions of volts required to make it work were safe?

aVhe became a showman.
p55
aa(lp56
VNT: We are at the dawn of a new age,
p57
aVthe age of electricity.

aVelectricity across the ether.
p61
aVIt is the magic of science.
p62
aV(Applause)

p65
aVradio, wireless telegraphy,
p66
aVremote control, robotics.
p67
aVHe even photographed the bones of the human body.
p68
aVBut the high point was the realization of a childhood dream:
p69
aVharnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls,
p70
aVand bringing light to the city.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut Tesla's success didn't last.
