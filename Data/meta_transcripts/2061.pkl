VTED is 30.
p4
aVThe world wide web is celebrating this month
p5
aVits 25th anniversary.
p6
aVSo I've got a question for you.
p7
aVLet's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.
p8
aVLet's talk about the state.
p9
aVLet's talk about what sort of a web we want.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.
p12
aVI got permission in the end after about a year
p13
aVto basically do it as a side project.
p14
aVI wrote the code.
p15
aVI was I suppose the first user.
p16
aVThere was a lot of concern
p17
aVthat people didn't want to pick it up
p18
aVbecause it would be too complicated.
p19
aVA lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful
p20
aVcollaboration with other people,
p21
aVand bit by bit, it worked.
p22
aVIt took off. It was pretty cool.
p23
aVAnd in fact, a few years later in 2000,
p24
aVfive percent of the world population
p25
aVwere using the world wide web.
p26
aVIn 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.
p27
aVIn 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation
p28
aVpartly to look at that
p29
aVand worry about that figure.
p30
aVAnd now here we are in 2014,
p31
aVand 40 percent of the world
p32
aVare using the world wide web, and counting.
p33
aVObviously it's increasing.
p34
aa(lp35
VI want you to think about both sides of that.
p36
aVOkay, obviously to anybody here at TED,
p37
aVthe first question you ask is, what can we do
p38
aVto get the other 60 percent on board
p39
aVas quickly as possible?
p40
aVLots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile.
p41
aVBut also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,
p42
aVbecause if you're sitting there yourself
p43
aVsort of with a web-enabled life,
p44
aVyou don't remember things anymore,
p45
aVyou just look them up,
p46
aVthen you may feel that it's been a success
p47
aVand we can all sit back.
p48
aVBut in fact, yeah, it's been a success,
p49
aVthere's lots of things, Khan Academy
p50
aVfor crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,
p51
aVthere's a huge number of free e-books
p52
aVthat you can read online,
p53
aVlots of wonderful things for education,
p54
aVthings in many areas.
p55
aVOnline commerce has in some cases
p56
aVcompletely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether,
p57
aVmade types of commerce available
p58
aVwhich weren't available at all before.
p59
aVCommerce has been almost universally affected.
p60
aVGovernment, not universally affected,
p61
aVbut very affected, and on a good day,
p62
aVlots of open data, lots of e-government,
p63
aVso lots of things which are visible
p64
aVhappening on the web.
p65
aa(lp66
VAlso, lots of things which are less visible.
p67
aVThe healthcare, late at night when they're worried
p68
aVabout what sort of cancer
p69
aVsomebody they care about might have,
p70
aVwhen they just talk across the Internet to somebody
p71
aVwho they care about very much in another country.
p72
aVThose sorts of things are not, they're not out there,
p73
aVand in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy.
p74
aVSo we cannot assume that part of the web,
p75
aVpart of the deal with the web,
p76
aVis when I use the web,
p77
aVit's just a transparent, neutral medium.
p78
aVI can talk to you over it without worrying
p79
aVabout what we in fact now know is happening,
p80
aVwithout worrying about the fact
p81
aVthat not only will surveillance be happening
p82
aVbut it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.
p83
aVSo in fact, something we realized,
p84
aVwe can't just use the web,
p85
aVwe have to worry about
p86
aVwhat the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,
p87
aVis it in fact of a quality that we need?
p88
aVWe revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech.
p89
aVWe can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people
p90
aVcan see our tweets, except when they can't,
p91
aVexcept when actually Twitter is blocked from their country,
p92
aVor in some way the way we try to express ourselves
p93
aVhas put some information about the state of ourselves,
p94
aVthe state of the country we live in,
p95
aVwhich isn't available to anybody else.
p96
aVSo we must protest and make sure
p97
aVthat censorship is cut down,
p98
aVthat the web is opened up
p99
aVwhere there is censorship.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe love the fact that the web is open.
p102
aVIt allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.
p103
aVIt doesn't matter who we are.
p104
aVAnd then we join these big
p105
aVsocial networking companies
p106
aVwhich are in fact effectively built as silos,
p107
aVso that it's much easier to talk to somebody
p108
aVin the same social network
p109
aVthan it is to talk to somebody in a different one,
p110
aVso in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.
p111
aVAnd we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble,
p112
aVthe filter bubble phenomenon is that
p113
aVwe love to use machines
p114
aVwhich help us find stuff we like.
p115
aVSo we love it when we're bathed in
p116
aVwhat things we like to click on,
p117
aVand so the machine automatically feeds us
p118
aVthe stuff that we like and we end up
p119
aVwith this rose-colored spectacles view of the world
p120
aVcalled a filter bubble.
p121
aVSo here are some of the things which maybe
p122
aVthreaten the social web we have.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat sort of web do you want?
p125
aVI want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces,
p126
aVas some countries have been suggesting
p127
aVthey should do in reaction to recent surveillance.
p128
aVI want a web which has got, for example,
p129
aVis a really good basis for democracy.
p130
aVI want a web where I can use healthcare
p131
aVwith privacy and where there's a lot
p132
aVof health data, clinical data is available
p133
aVto scientists to do research.
p134
aVI want a web where the other 60 percent
p135
aVget on board as fast as possible.
p136
aVI want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation
p137
aVthat when something nasty happens,
p138
aVsome disaster strikes, that we can respond
p139
aVby building stuff to respond to it very quickly.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo this is just some of the things that I want,
p142
aVfrom a big list, obviously it's longer.
p143
aVYou have your list.
p144
aVI want us to use this 25th anniversary
p145
aVto think about what sort of a web we want.
p146
aVYou can go to webat25.org
p147
aVand find some links.
p148
aVThere are lots of sites where people
p149
aVhave started to put together a Magna Carta,
p150
aVa bill of rights for the web.
p151
aVHow about we do that?
p152
aVHow about we decide, these are, in a way,
p153
aVbecoming fundamental rights, the right to communicate with whom I want.
p154
aVWhat would be on your list for that Magna Carta?
p155
aVLet's crowdsource a Magna Carta
p156
aVfor the web.
p157
aVLet's do that this year.
p158
aVLet's use the energy from the 25th anniversary
p159
aVto crowdsource a Magna Carta
p160
aVto the web. (Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you. And do me a favor, will you?
p163
aVFight for it for me. Okay? Thanks.
