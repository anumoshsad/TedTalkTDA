VI was born in Taiwan.
p4
aVI grew up surrounded by
p5
aVdifferent types of hardware stores,
p6
aVand I like going to night markets.
p7
aVI love the energy of the night markets,
p8
aVthe colors, the lights, the toys,
p9
aVand all the unexpected things I find every time I go,
p10
aVthings like watermelon with straw antennas
p11
aVor puppies with mohawks.
p12
aVWhen I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,
p13
aVany kind of toys I'd find around the house,
p14
aVlike my brother's BB gun when he's not home.
p15
aa(lp16
VI also liked to make environments
p17
aVfor people to explore and play.
p18
aVIn these early installations,
p19
aVI would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,
p20
aVand things I would find in the hardware store
p21
aVor around the house.
p22
aVI would take things like highlighter pen,
p23
aVmix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,
p24
aVcreating these glowing circulatory systems
p25
aVfor people to walk through and enjoy.
p26
aVI like these materials because of the way they look,
p27
aVthe way they feel, and they're very affordable.
p28
aa(lp29
VI also liked to make devices that work with body parts.
p30
aVI would take camera LED lights
p31
aVand a bungee cord and strap it on my waist
p32
aVand I would videotape my belly button,
p33
aVget a different perspective,
p34
aVand see what it does.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VI also like to modify household appliances.
p38
aVThis is an automatic night light.
p39
aVSome of you might have them at home.
p40
aVI would cut out the light sensor,
p41
aVadd an extension line,
p42
aVand use modeling clay,
p43
aVstick it onto the television,
p44
aVand then I would videotape my eye,
p45
aVand using the dark part of my eye
p46
aVtricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,
p47
aVso you turn on the lightbulb.
p48
aVThe white of the eye and the eyelid
p49
aVwill trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,
p50
aVand it will shut off the light.
p51
aa(lp52
VI wanted to collect more different types of eyes,
p53
aVso I built this device using bicycle helmets,
p54
aVsome lightbulbs and television sets.
p55
aVIt would be easier for other people to wear the helmet
p56
aVand record their eyes.
p57
aVThis device allows me to symbolically
p58
aVextract other people's eyes,
p59
aVso I have a diversity of eyes to use
p60
aVfor my other sculptures.
p61
aVThis sculpture has four eyes.
p62
aVEach eye is controlling a different device.
p63
aVThis eye is turning itself around in a television.
p64
aVThis eye is inflating a plastic tube.
p65
aVThis eye is watching a video of another piece being made.
p66
aVAnd these two eyes are activating glowing water.
p67
aVMany of these pieces are later on shown
p68
aVin museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions
p69
aVaround the world.
p70
aa(lp71
VI love science and biology.
p72
aVIn 2007, I was doing a research fellowship
p73
aVat the Smithsonian Natural History Museum
p74
aVlooking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.
p75
aVI love these creatures. I love the way they look, the way they feel.
p76
aVThey're soft, they're slimy,
p77
aVand I was fascinated by the way they use light
p78
aVin their environment,
p79
aVeither to attract mates, for self-defense,
p80
aVor to attract food.
p81
aVThis research inspired my work in many different ways,
p82
aVthings like movement or different light patterns.
p83
aVSo I started gathering a lot of
p84
aVdifferent types of material in my studio
p85
aVand just experimenting
p86
aVand trying this out, trying that out,
p87
aVand seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.
p88
aVI used a lot of computer cooling fans
p89
aVand just kind of put them together and see what happens.
p90
aVThis is an 8,000-square-foot installation
p91
aVcomposed of many different creatures,
p92
aVsome hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.
p93
aVFrom afar, they look alien-like,
p94
aVbut when you look closer,
p95
aVthey're all made out of black garbage bags
p96
aVor Tupperware containers.
p97
aa(lp98
VI'd like to share with you how ordinary things
p99
aVcan become something magical and wondrous.
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aVThank you.
