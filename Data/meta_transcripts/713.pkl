VMy name is Ryan Lobo,
p4
aVand I've been involved in the documentary
p5
aVfilmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.
p6
aVDuring the process of making these films
p7
aVI found myself taking photographs,
p8
aVoften much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.
p9
aa(lp10
VI found this photography of mine almost compulsive.
p11
aVAnd at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that
p12
aVI had photographs that told a better story
p13
aVthan a sometimes-sensational documentary.
p14
aVI felt, when I had my photographs,
p15
aVthat I was holding on to something true,
p16
aVregardless of agendas or politics.
p17
aVIn 2007, I traveled to three war zones.
p18
aVI traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.
p19
aVAnd over there I experienced
p20
aVother people's suffering, up close and personal,
p21
aVimmersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,
p22
aVand at times I experienced great fear for my own life.
p23
aa(lp24
VAs always, I would return to Bangalore,
p25
aVand often to animated discussions at friend's homes,
p26
aVwhere we would discuss various issues
p27
aVwhile they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,
p28
aVwhere a drink often cost more than what they'd paid
p29
aVtheir 14-year-old maid.
p30
aVI would feel very isolated during these discussions.
p31
aVBut at the same time, I questioned myself
p32
aVand my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.
p33
aVAnd I decided that I had compromised,
p34
aVjust like my friends in those discussions,
p35
aVwhere we told stories
p36
aVin contexts we made excuses for,
p37
aVrather than taking responsibility for.
p38
aa(lp39
VI won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,
p40
aVbut let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,
p41
aVother substances and a woman.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVI basically decided that it was I,
p44
aVnot the camera or the network,
p45
aVor anything that lay outside myself,
p46
aVthat was the only instrument in storytelling
p47
aVtruly worth tuning.
p48
aVIn my life, when I tried to achieve things
p49
aVlike success or recognition, they eluded me.
p50
aVParadoxically, when I let go of these objectives,
p51
aVand worked from a place of compassion and purpose,
p52
aVlooking for excellence, rather than the results of it,
p53
aVeverything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.
p54
aa(lp55
VPhotography transcended culture, including my own.
p56
aVAnd it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,
p57
aVand gives voice to people and stories without.
p58
aVI invite you into three recent stories of mine,
p59
aVwhich are about this way of looking, if you will,
p60
aVwhich I believe exemplify the tenets
p61
aVof what I like to call compassion in storytelling.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn 2007 I went to Liberia,
p64
aVwhere a group of my friends and I
p65
aVdid an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,
p66
aVon a very legendary and brutal war-lord
p67
aVnamed General Butt Naked.
p68
aVHis real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell
p69
aVwhere he once used to torture and murder people,
p70
aVincluding children.
p71
aVJoshua claims to have personally killed
p72
aVmore than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.
p73
aVHe got his name from fighting stark naked.
p74
aVAnd he is probably the most prolific mass murderer
p75
aValive on Earth today.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.
p78
aVJoshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,
p79
aVand enforced his command with great brutality.
p80
aVToday many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,
p81
aVand they are destitute, like these young men in the image.
p82
aVHow do you live with yourself
p83
aVif you know you've committed horrific crimes?
p84
aVToday the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.
p85
aVAnd he's on a mission.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,
p88
aVvisiting villages where he had once killed and raped.
p89
aVHe seeked forgiveness,
p90
aVand he claims to endeavor to improve
p91
aVthe lives of his child-soldiers.
p92
aVDuring this expedition I expected him
p93
aVto be killed outright, and us as well.
p94
aVBut what I saw opened my eyes
p95
aVto an idea of forgiveness
p96
aVwhich I never thought possible.
p97
aVIn the midst of incredible poverty and loss,
p98
aVpeople who had nothing absolved a man
p99
aVwho had taken everything from them.
p100
aVHe begs for forgiveness,
p101
aVand receives it from the same woman
p102
aVwhose brother he murdered.
p103
aVSenegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,
p104
aVwas once a child soldier, under the General's command,
p105
aVuntil he disobeyed orders,
p106
aVand the General shot off both his legs.
p107
aVHe forgives the General in this image.
p108
aVHe risked his life as he walked up to people
p109
aVwhose families he'd murdered.
p110
aa(lp111
VIn this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.
p112
aVAnd Joshua remains silent
p113
aVas they vented their rage against him.
p114
aVThis image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,
p115
aVwith a man, surrounded by various influences,
p116
aVdesperate to hold on to something true within himself,
p117
aVin a context of great suffering that he has created himself.
p118
aa(lp119
VI was intensely moved during all this.
p120
aVBut the question is,
p121
aVdoes forgiveness and redemption replace justice?
p122
aVJoshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind
p123
aVstanding trial for his crimes,
p124
aVand speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,
p125
aVto an audience that often includes his victims.
p126
aVA very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of
p127
aVseparation of church and state.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe second story I'm going to tell you about
p130
aVis about a group of very special fighting women
p131
aVwith rather unique peace-keeping skills.
p132
aVLiberia has been devastated by one of Africa's
p133
aVbloodiest civil wars,
p134
aVwhich has left more than 200,000 people dead,
p135
aVthousands of women scarred by rape and crime
p136
aVon a spectacular scale.
p137
aVLiberia is now home
p138
aVto an all-woman United Nations contingent
p139
aVof Indian peacekeepers.
p140
aa(lp141
VThese women, many from small towns in India,
p142
aVhelp keep the peace, far away from home and family.
p143
aVThey use negotiation and tolerance
p144
aVmore often than an armed response.
p145
aVThe commander told me that a woman could gauge
p146
aVa potentially violent situation
p147
aVmuch better than men.
p148
aVAnd that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.
p149
aVThis man was very drunk,
p150
aVand he was very interested in my camera,
p151
aVuntil he noticed the women, who handled him
p152
aVwith smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VThis contingent seems to be quite lucky,
p156
aVand it has not sustained any casualties,
p157
aVeven though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.
p158
aVAnd yes, all of those people killed were male.
p159
aVMany of the women are married with children,
p160
aVand they say the hardest part of their deployment
p161
aVwas being kept away from their children.
p162
aa(lp163
VI accompanied these women on their patrols,
p164
aVand watched as they walked past men,
p165
aVmany who passed very lewd comments incessantly.
p166
aVAnd when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,
p167
aVshe said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.
p168
aVWe know how to deal with these fellows,"
p169
aVand ignored them.
p170
aa(lp171
VIn a country ravaged by violence against women,
p172
aVIndian peacekeepers have inspired many local women
p173
aVto join the police force.
p174
aVSometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,
p175
aVthe most inspiring stories are the ones
p176
aVthat float just beneath the radar.
p177
aVI came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.
p178
aVAnd one editor told me that she wasn't interested
p179
aVin doing what she called "manual labor stories."
p180
aa(lp181
VIn 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,
p182
aVwhich, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.
p183
aVThey answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.
p184
aVAnd all this against incredible logistical odds,
p185
aVlike heat and traffic jams.
p186
aVSomething amazing happened during this shoot.
p187
aVDue to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,
p188
aVa large slum, which had caught fire.
p189
aVAs we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks
p190
aVand stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.
p191
aVThese men were terrified,
p192
aVas the mob attacked our vehicle.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut nonetheless, despite the hostility,
p195
aVfirefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.
p196
aVRunning the gauntlet through hostile crowds,
p197
aVand some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.
p198
aVSome of the local people forcibly took away the hoses
p199
aVfrom the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.
p200
aVNow, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
p201
aVBut the question that lingered in my mind was,
p202
aVwhat causes people to destroy fire trucks
p203
aVheaded to their own homes?
p204
aVWhere does such rage come from?
p205
aVAnd how are we responsible for this?
p206
aV45 percent of the 14 million people
p207
aVwho live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,
p208
aVwhich are chronically overcrowded.
p209
aVThey lack even the most basic amenities.
p210
aVAnd this is something that is common to all our big cities.
p211
aa(lp212
VBack to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,
p213
aVthousands of drums filled with petrochemicals
p214
aVwere blazing away and exploding all around us.
p215
aVThe heat was so intense, that hoses were used
p216
aVto cool down firefighters
p217
aVfighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.
p218
aVIn India we often love to complain about our government bodies.
p219
aVBut over here, the heads of the DFS,
p220
aVMr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,
p221
aVled the firefight with their men.
p222
aVSomething wonderful in a country where
p223
aVmanual labor is often looked down upon.
p224
aV(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VOver the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.
p227
aVAnd I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,
p228
aVand my own faith in humanity.
p229
aVHowever, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.
p230
aVAnd when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with
p231
aVand they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.
p232
aVSome of the firemen told me that they were also inspired
p233
aVto do better because they were so pleased
p234
aVto get thank-yous rather than brick bats.
p235
aa(lp236
VIt seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,
p237
aVat least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,
p238
aVread magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.
p239
aVSometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,
p240
aVregardless of the context,
p241
aVcan help magnify these intangibles three ways,
p242
aVin the protagonist of the story, in the audience,
p243
aVand also in the storyteller.
p244
aVAnd that's the power of storytelling.
p245
aVFocus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,
p246
aVand it grows. Thank you.
