VI have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.
p4
aVAnd it's an African story.
p5
aVIt is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.
p6
aa(lp7
VThere was Hollywood.
p8
aVThen came Bollywood.
p9
aVToday we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.
p10
aVIn 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.
p11
aVNow, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week
p12
aVin the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.
p13
aVSome estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
p14
aVIt has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
p15
aVAnd it's expanding.
p16
aVBut keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.
p17
aVThis is something that happened without foreign investment,
p18
aVwithout government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,
p19
aVin one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.
p20
aVThe industry is 15 years old.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd so maybe you're thinking now,
p23
aVwhy, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston
p24
aVis so interested in this story?
p25
aVAnd so I think I have to tell you just a few words,
p26
aVa few things about my personal life,
p27
aVbecause I think there is a connection.
p28
aVMy grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.
p29
aVMy father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.
p30
aVAnd I was born in Zambia.
p31
aVEven though I left when I was only three years old,
p32
aVI really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.
p33
aVAnd it really was a place where I learned to walk.
p34
aVI think I uttered the first words,
p35
aVand my family bought their first home.
p36
aVSo when we came back to Italy,
p37
aVand one of the things that I remember the most
p38
aVis my family having this hard time to share stories.
p39
aVIt seemed that for our neighbors and friends,
p40
aVAfrica was either this exotic place, this imaginary land
p41
aVthat probably exists only in their imagination,
p42
aVor the place of horror, famine.
p43
aVAnd so we were always caught in this stereotype.
p44
aVAnd I remember really this desire to talk about Africa
p45
aVas a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,
p46
aVand have dreams like we all have.
p47
aVSo when I read in a newspaper in the business page
p48
aVthe story of Nollywood,
p49
aVI really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story
p50
aVthat goes against all these preconceived notions.
p51
aa(lp52
VHere I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,
p53
aVand actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.
p54
aVI have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence
p55
aVat the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.
p56
aVAnd we really look how digital technology is changing,
p57
aVand how young, independent filmmakers
p58
aVcan make movies at a fraction of the cost.
p59
aVSo when I proposed the story,
p60
aVI really had all the support to make this film.
p61
aVAnd not only had the support,
p62
aVI found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.
p63
aVAimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,
p64
aVand Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,
p65
aVwho is a veteran of National Geographic,
p66
aVand told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,
p67
aVI don't know if I have come across a story
p68
aVthat is so full of hope and so fun."
p69
aa(lp70
VSo we went to Lagos in October 2005.
p71
aVAnd we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,
p72
aVa wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.
p73
aVThe plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,
p74
aVof this incredible film industry,
p75
aVfollowing Bond in his quest to make an action movie
p76
aVthat deals with the issue of corruption,
p77
aVcalled "Checkpoint."
p78
aVPolice corruption.
p79
aVAnd he had nine days to make it.
p80
aVWe thought this was a good story.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,
p83
aVand we talked to a lot of filmmakers.
p84
aVBut I don't want to create too many expectations.
p85
aVI would like to show you six minutes.
p86
aVAnd these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.
p87
aVThere are several themes from the documentary,
p88
aVbut they are re-edited and made for you, OK?
p89
aVSo I guess it's a world premier.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Video)
p92
aVMan: Action.
p93
aVMilverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.
p94
aVAnd you shoot in seven days.
p95
aVPeace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.
p96
aVWe're not doing films for the elite
p97
aVand the people in their glass houses.
p98
aVThey can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.
p99
aVMahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,
p100
aVis a kind of subsistence filmmaking \u2014 what they do to make a living.
p101
aVIt's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,
p102
aVoh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,
p103
aVand where you have big budgets.
p104
aa(lp105
VHere is that you make these films,
p106
aVit sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,
p107
aVbecause if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.
p108
aVBond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.
p109
aa(lp110
VI believe in the power of audiovisuals.
p111
aVI mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.
p112
aVI think it's the most viable vehicle right now
p113
aVto pass information across a dedicated cable.
p114
aVSo if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,
p115
aVput in a message in there.
p116
aVWoman: You still have to report the incident.
p117
aVHe needs proper medical attention.
p118
aVPP: I keep trying to explain to people,
p119
aVit's not about the quality at the moment \u2014 the quality is coming.
p120
aVI mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,
p121
aVbut the first thing you have to remember about this society
p122
aVis that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,
p123
aVand these are the people that really watch these films.
p124
aa(lp125
VSonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry
p126
aVthat has just been born in this part of the world.
p127
aVBecause nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.
p128
aVLancelot Imasen: But our films,
p129
aVthey are stories that our people can relate to themselves.
p130
aVThey are stories about our people, for our people.
p131
aVAnd consistently, they are glued to their screen
p132
aVwhenever they see the story.
p133
aVNarrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.
p134
aVIt's the blockbuster comedy.
p135
aVYou'll crack your ribs.
p136
aa(lp137
VBernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.
p138
aVIt's all about the foreign movies.
p139
aVBut we can do something too.
p140
aVWe can do something, something that when the world sees it,
p141
aVthey say, wow, this is Nigeria.
p142
aVMan: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.
p143
aVDon't embarrass yourself.
p144
aVCome on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.
p145
aa(lp146
VSMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.
p147
aVIt\u2019s not just what you see in picture.
p148
aVYou see the person live.
p149
aVYou see how he talks. You see how he lives.
p150
aVHe influences you really good, you know.
p151
aVIt\u2019s not just what you see in the picture.
p152
aVIt is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.
p153
aVMan: See you. Bye.
p154
aVAction.
p155
aa(lp156
VSaint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.
p157
aVBut then when I discovered the situation in my country,
p158
aVat that time there was so much corruption.
p159
aVFor a young man to really make it out here,
p160
aVyou got to think of some negative things and all that,
p161
aVor some kind of vices.
p162
aVAnd I didn't want that, you know.
p163
aVAnd I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,
p164
aVwithout doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.
p165
aVJust me and God-given talent.
p166
aVMan: Let's go.
p167
aVOK, it's time to kick some ass.
p168
aVCover this. It's your own.
p169
aVMove it.
p170
aa(lp171
VRoboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,
p172
aVthey have all these things in place.
p173
aVBut here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.
p174
aVLike they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,
p175
aVbut you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.
p176
aVKevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.
p177
aVWoman: That's why I use enough masking tape.
p178
aVThe masking tape will hold it.
p179
aVWat, wait. Just hold this for me.
p180
aVKBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well
p181
aVso that it won't affect my face \u2014 the explosion, you know.
p182
aVBut she's a professional. She knows what she\u2019s doing.
p183
aVI'm trying to protect my face too.
p184
aVThis ain't going to be my last movie.
p185
aVYou know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.
p186
aa(lp187
VRA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,
p188
aVwith or without any assistance from anybody.
p189
aVMan: Action.
p190
aVCut.
p191
aV(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VFranco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.
p194
aVSo many themes in this story.
p195
aVI just can't tell you \u2014 there\u2019s one thing I want to tell you.
p196
aVI spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,
p197
aVand the problems they have to go through are unimaginable
p198
aVfor, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.
p199
aVBut always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,
p200
aVthat is incredible.
p201
aa(lp202
VWerner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,
p203
aV"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."
p204
aVAnd I think they\u2019re breathing.
p205
aVThe Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.
p206
aVAnd so it's a very, very important thing for them,
p207
aVand for their audiences.
p208
aVA woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,
p209
aVI can relax, I really \u2014 I can breathe better."
p210
aa(lp211
VThere is also another very important thing
p212
aVthat I hope will resonate with this audience.
p213
aVIt\u2019s technology. I\u2019m very interested in it
p214
aVand I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,
p215
aVthe cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.
p216
aVIncredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.
p217
aVAnd this has unleashed tremendous energy.
p218
aVAnd guess what?
p219
aVWe didn\u2019t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.
p220
aVThey understood it, they embraced the technology
p221
aVand they run with it, and they\u2019re successful.
p222
aVI hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
p223
aVI hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,
p224
aVlook at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,
p225
aVcreate a narrative for the population, something to identify,
p226
aVsomething positive, something that really is psychological relief
p227
aVand it's part of the culture.
p228
aVBut I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.
p229
aVI really think it goes both ways.
p230
aa(lp231
VFilmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,
p232
aV"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,
p233
aVand make a buck and live with this job."
p234
aVSo I really think it\u2019s a lesson
p235
aVthat we're actually learning from them.
p236
aVAnd there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,
p237
aVand should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.
p238
aVAnd I think this is really the theme of this session.
p239
aVTry to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.
p240
aVNo stories around the campfire.
p241
aVNo legends, no fairytales.
p242
aVNothing.
p243
aVNo novels.
p244
aVDifficult, eh? It's meaningless.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo this is what I really think.
p247
aVI think that the key to a healthy society
p248
aVis a thriving community of storytellers,
p249
aVand I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.
p250
aVI would like you to hear their voices.
p251
aVJust a few moments.
p252
aVIt\u2019s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.
p255
aVIf you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,
p256
aVthat\u2019s Nollywood.
p257
aVSO: I believe very soon, we\u2019re not only going to have better movies,
p258
aVwe'll have that original Nigerian movie.
p259
aVBE: It\u2019s still the same basic themes.
p260
aVLove, action.
p261
aVBut we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.
p262
aVWe have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,
p263
aVthat in the natal lifetimes,
p264
aVI don't see us exhausting the stories we have.
p265
aa(lp266
VFS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.
p267
aVAnd I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,
p268
aVwhere we teach each other things.
p269
aVAnd I really hope that this will happen.
p270
aVThank you very much.
p271
aV(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VChris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.
p274
aVFranco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.
p275
aVWhat does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?
p276
aa(lp277
VFS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly \u2014 it's close to 2,000 films.
p278
aVThere is scientific data on this.
p279
aa(lp280
VCA: 2,000 films a year?
p281
aVFS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,
p282
aVthe censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.
p283
aVAnd we know that there are more.
p284
aVSo it\u2019s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.
p285
aVSo imagine 45 films per week.
p286
aVThere are challenges. There are challenges.
p287
aVThere is a glut of film,
p288
aVthe quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,
p289
aVbut I\u2019m optimistic.
p290
aa(lp291
VCA: And these aren\u2019t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?
p292
aa(lp293
VFS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.
p294
aVMaybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,
p295
aVthese are films that are distributed directly in markets.
p296
aVThey are bought in video shops.
p297
aVThey can be rented for pennies.
p298
aa(lp299
VCA: On what format?
p300
aa(lp301
VFS: Oh, the format \u2014 thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.
p302
aVIt's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.
p303
aVThey started with VHS.
p304
aVThey actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.
p305
aVThey started in '92, '94.
p306
aVSo there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria
p307
aVthat play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.
p308
aVIt's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.
p309
aa(lp310
VCA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?
p311
aa(lp312
VFS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam
p313
aVand you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVAnd I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,
p316
aVit's a commodity, it's a staple.
p317
aVThere is no life without stories.
p318
aa(lp319
VCA: Franco, thank you so much.
