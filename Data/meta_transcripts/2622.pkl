VLast year,
p4
aVthree of my family members were gruesomely murdered
p5
aVin a hate crime.
p6
aVIt goes without saying that it's really difficult
p7
aVfor me to be here today,
p8
aVbut my brother Deah,
p9
aVhis wife Yusor,
p10
aVand her sister Razan
p11
aVdon't give me much of a choice.
p12
aVI'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice,
p13
aVand join me in standing up against hate.
p14
aa(lp15
VIt's December 27, 2014:
p16
aVthe morning of my brother's wedding day.
p17
aVHe asks me to come over and comb his hair
p18
aVin preparation for his wedding photo shoot.
p19
aVA 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball, particularly Steph Curry, fanatic \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAn American kid in dental school ready to take on the world.
p24
aVWhen Deah and Yusor have their first dance,
p25
aVI see the love in his eyes,
p26
aVher reciprocated joy,
p27
aVand my emotions begin to overwhelm me.
p28
aVI move to the back of the hall and burst into tears.
p29
aVAnd the second the song finishes playing,
p30
aVhe beelines towards me,
p31
aVburies me into his arms
p32
aVand rocks me back and forth.
p33
aVEven in that moment,
p34
aVwhen everything was so distracting,
p35
aVhe was attuned to me.
p36
aa(lp37
VHe cups my face and says,
p38
aV"Suzanne,
p39
aVI am who I am because of you.
p40
aVThank you for everything.
p41
aVI love you."
p42
aa(lp43
VAbout a month later, I'm back home in North Carolina for a short visit,
p44
aVand on the last evening, I run upstairs to Deah's room,
p45
aVeager to find out how he's feeling being a newly married man.
p46
aVWith a big boyish smile he says,
p47
aV"I'm so happy. I love her. She's an amazing girl."
p48
aVAnd she is.
p49
aVAt just 21, she'd recently been accepted to join Deah
p50
aVat UNC dental school.
p51
aVShe shared his love for basketball, and at her urging,
p52
aVthey started their honeymoon off attending their favorite team of the NBA,
p53
aVthe LA Lakers.
p54
aVI mean, check out that form.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VI'll never forget that moment sitting there with him \u2014
p59
aVhow free he was in his happiness.
p60
aVMy littler brother, a basketball-obsessed kid,
p61
aVhad become and transformed into an accomplished young man.
p62
aVHe was at the top of his dental school class,
p63
aVand alongside Yusor and Razan,
p64
aVwas involved in local and international community service projects
p65
aVdedicated to the homeless and refugees,
p66
aVincluding a dental relief trip they were planning
p67
aVfor Syrian refugees in Turkey.
p68
aa(lp69
VRazan, at just 19,
p70
aVused her creativity as an architectural engineering student
p71
aVto serve those around her,
p72
aVmaking care packages for the local homeless,
p73
aVamong other projects.
p74
aVThat is who they were.
p75
aa(lp76
VStanding there that night,
p77
aVI take a deep breath and look at Deah and tell him,
p78
aV"I have never been more proud of you than I am in this moment."
p79
aVHe pulls me into his tall frame,
p80
aVhugs me goodnight,
p81
aVand I leave the next morning without waking him
p82
aVto go back to San Francisco.
p83
aVThat is the last time I ever hug him.
p84
aa(lp85
VTen days later, I'm on call at San Francisco General Hospital
p86
aVwhen I receive a barrage of vague text messages expressing condolences.
p87
aVConfused, I call my father, who calmly intones,
p88
aV"There's been a shooting in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.
p89
aVIt's on lock-down. That's all we know."
p90
aVI hang up and quickly Google, "shooting in Chapel Hill."
p91
aVOne hit comes up.
p92
aVQuote:
p93
aV"Three people were shot in the back of the head
p94
aVand confirmed dead on the scene."
p95
aVSomething in me just knows.
p96
aVI fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor,
p97
aVwailing.
p98
aa(lp99
VI take the first red-eye out of San Francisco,
p100
aVnumb and disoriented.
p101
aVI walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents' arms,
p102
aVsobbing.
p103
aVI then run up to Deah's room as I did so many times before,
p104
aVjust looking for him,
p105
aVonly to find a void that will never be filled.
p106
aa(lp107
VInvestigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed
p108
aVthe sequence of events.
p109
aVDeah had just gotten off the bus from class,
p110
aVRazan was visiting for dinner,
p111
aValready at home with Yusor.
p112
aVAs they began to eat, they heard a knock on the door.
p113
aVWhen Deah opened it,
p114
aVtheir neighbor proceeded to fire multiple shots at him.
p115
aVAccording to 911 calls,
p116
aVthe girls were heard screaming.
p117
aVThe man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,
p118
aVimmobilizing her.
p119
aVHe then approached her from behind,
p120
aVpressed the barrel of his gun against her head,
p121
aVand with a single bullet, lacerated her midbrain.
p122
aVHe then turned towards Razan, who was screaming for her life,
p123
aVand, execution-style, with a single bullet
p124
aVto the back of the head,
p125
aVkilled her.
p126
aVOn his way out,
p127
aVhe shot Deah one last time \u2014 a bullet in the mouth \u2014
p128
aVfor a total of eight bullets:
p129
aVtwo lodged in the head,
p130
aVtwo in his chest
p131
aVand the rest in his extremities.
p132
aa(lp133
VDeah, Yusor and Razan were executed
p134
aVin a place that was meant to be safe: their home.
p135
aVFor months, this man had been harassing them:
p136
aVknocking on their door,
p137
aVbrandishing his gun on a couple of occasions.
p138
aVHis Facebook was cluttered with anti-religion posts.
p139
aVYusor felt particularly threatened by him.
p140
aVAs she was moving in,
p141
aVhe told Yusor and her mom that he didn't like the way they looked.
p142
aVIn response, Yusor's mom told her to be kind to her neighbor,
p143
aVthat as he got to know them,
p144
aVhe'd see them for who they were.
p145
aVI guess we've all become so numb to the hatred
p146
aVthat we couldn't have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe man who murdered my brother turned himself in to the police
p149
aVshortly after the murders,
p150
aVsaying he killed three kids,
p151
aVexecution-style,
p152
aVover a parking dispute.
p153
aVThe police issued a premature public statement that morning,
p154
aVechoing his claims without bothering to question it
p155
aVor further investigate.
p156
aVIt turns out there was no parking dispute.
p157
aVThere was no argument.
p158
aVNo violation.
p159
aVBut the damage was already done.
p160
aVIn a 24-hour media cycle,
p161
aVthe words "parking dispute" had already become the go-to sound bite.
p162
aa(lp163
VI sit on my brother's bed and remember his words,
p164
aVthe words he gave me so freely and with so much love,
p165
aV"I am who I am because of you."
p166
aVThat's what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief
p167
aVand speak out.
p168
aVI cannot let my family's deaths be diminished to a segment
p169
aVthat is barely discussed on local news.
p170
aVThey were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith,
p171
aVbecause of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads,
p172
aVbecause they were visibly Muslim.
p173
aa(lp174
VSome of the rage I felt at the time
p175
aVwas that if roles were reversed,
p176
aVand an Arab, Muslim or Muslim-appearing person
p177
aVhad killed three white American college students execution-style,
p178
aVin their home,
p179
aVwhat would we have called it?
p180
aVA terrorist attack.
p181
aVWhen white men commit acts of violence in the US,
p182
aVthey're lone wolves,
p183
aVmentally ill
p184
aVor driven by a parking dispute.
p185
aVI know that I have to give my family voice,
p186
aVand I do the only thing I know how:
p187
aVI send a Facebook message to everyone I know in media.
p188
aa(lp189
VA couple of hours later,
p190
aVin the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family,
p191
aVour neighbor Neal comes over, sits down next to my parents
p192
aVand asks, "What can I do?"
p193
aVNeal had over two decades of experience in journalism,
p194
aVbut he makes it clear that he's not there in his capacity as journalist,
p195
aVbut as a neighbor who wants to help.
p196
aVI ask him what he thinks we should do,
p197
aVgiven the bombardment of local media interview requests.
p198
aVHe offers to set up a press conference at a local community center.
p199
aVEven now I don't have the words to thank him.
p200
aV"Just tell me when, and I'll have all the news channels present," he said.
p201
aa(lp202
VHe did for us what we could not do for ourselves
p203
aVin a moment of devastation.
p204
aVI delivered the press statement,
p205
aVstill wearing scrubs from the previous night.
p206
aVAnd in under 24 hours from the murders,
p207
aVI'm on CNN being interviewed by Anderson Cooper.
p208
aVThe following day, major newspapers \u2014
p209
aVincluding the New York Times, Chicago Tribune \u2014
p210
aVpublished stories about Deah, Yusor and Razan,
p211
aVallowing us to reclaim the narrative
p212
aVand call attention the mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hatred.
p213
aa(lp214
VThese days,
p215
aVit feels like Islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.
p216
aVWe just have to put up with it and smile.
p217
aVThe nasty stares,
p218
aVthe palpable fear when boarding a plane,
p219
aVthe random pat downs at airports that happen 99 percent of the time.
p220
aa(lp221
VIt doesn't stop there.
p222
aVWe have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs.
p223
aVHere in the US,
p224
aVwe have presidential candidates like Donald Trump,
p225
aVcasually calling to register American Muslims,
p226
aVand ban Muslim immigrants and refugees from entering this country.
p227
aVIt is no coincidence that hate crimes rise
p228
aVin parallel with election cycles.
p229
aa(lp230
VJust a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,
p231
aVa Lebanese-American Christian,
p232
aVwas murdered in Oklahoma by his neighbor \u2014
p233
aVa man who called him a "filthy Arab."
p234
aVThis man was previously jailed for a mere 8 months,
p235
aVafter attempting run over Khalid's mother with his car.
p236
aVChances are you haven't heard Khalid's story,
p237
aVbecause it didn't make it to national news.
p238
aVThe least we can do is call it what it is:
p239
aVa hate crime.
p240
aVThe least we can do is talk about it,
p241
aVbecause violence and hatred doesn't just happen in a vacuum.
p242
aa(lp243
VNot long after coming back to work,
p244
aVI'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,
p245
aVwhen one of my patients looks over at my colleague,
p246
aVgestures around her face and says, "San Bernardino,"
p247
aVreferencing a recent terrorist attack.
p248
aVHere I am having just lost three family members to Islamophobia,
p249
aVhaving been a vocal advocate within my program
p250
aVon how to deal with such microaggressions,
p251
aVand yet \u2014
p252
aVsilence.
p253
aVI was disheartened.
p254
aVHumiliated.
p255
aa(lp256
VDays later rounding on the same patient,
p257
aVshe looks at me and says,
p258
aV"Your people are killing people in Los Angeles."
p259
aVI look around expectantly.
p260
aVAgain:
p261
aVsilence.
p262
aVI realize that yet again,
p263
aVI have to speak up for myself.
p264
aVI sit on her bed and gently ask her,
p265
aV"Have I ever done anything but treat you with respect and kindness?
p266
aVHave I done anything but give you compassionate care?"
p267
aVShe looks down and realizes what she said was wrong,
p268
aVand in front of the entire team,
p269
aVshe apologizes and says,
p270
aV"I should know better. I'm Mexican-American.
p271
aVI receive this kind of treatment all the time."
p272
aa(lp273
VMany of us experience microaggressions on a daily basis.
p274
aVOdds are you may have experienced it,
p275
aVwhether for your race,
p276
aVgender,
p277
aVsexuality
p278
aVor religious beliefs.
p279
aVWe've all been in situations where we've witnessed something wrong
p280
aVand didn't speak up.
p281
aVMaybe we weren't equipped with the tools to respond in the moment.
p282
aVMaybe we weren't even aware of our own implicit biases.
p283
aVWe can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable,
p284
aVbut when we see it,
p285
aVwe're silent,
p286
aVbecause it makes us uncomfortable.
p287
aa(lp288
VBut stepping right into that discomfort
p289
aVmeans you are also stepping into the ally zone.
p290
aVThere may be over three million Muslims in America.
p291
aVThat's still just one percent of the total population.
p292
aVMartin Luther King once said,
p293
aV"In the end,
p294
aVwe will remember not the words of our enemies,
p295
aVbut the silence of our friends."
p296
aa(lp297
VSo what made my neighbor Neal's allyship so profound?
p298
aVA couple of things.
p299
aVHe was there as a neighbor who cared,
p300
aVbut he was also bringing in his professional expertise and resources
p301
aVwhen the moment called for it.
p302
aVOthers have done the same.
p303
aVLarycia Hawkins drew on her platform
p304
aVas the first tenured African-American professor at Wheaton College
p305
aVto wear a hijab in solidarity
p306
aVwith Muslim women who face discrimination every day.
p307
aVAs a result, she lost her job.
p308
aVWithin a month,
p309
aVshe joined the faculty at the University of Virginia,
p310
aVwhere she now works on pluralism, race, faith and culture.
p311
aa(lp312
VReddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,
p313
aVdemonstrated that not all active allyship needs to be so serious.
p314
aVHe stepped up to support a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission
p315
aVto introduce a hijab emoji.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VIt's a simple gesture,
p320
aVbut it has a significant subconscious impact
p321
aVon normalizing and humanizing Muslims,
p322
aVincluding the community as a part of an "us"
p323
aVinstead of an "other."
p324
aVThe editor in chief of Women's Running magazine
p325
aVjust put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a US fitness magazine.
p326
aVThese are all very different examples
p327
aVof people who drew upon their platforms and resources
p328
aVin academia, tech and media,
p329
aVto actively express their allyship.
p330
aa(lp331
VWhat resources and expertise do you bring to the table?
p332
aVAre you willing to step into your discomfort
p333
aVand speak up when you witness hateful bigotry?
p334
aVWill you be Neal?
p335
aa(lp336
VMany neighbors appeared in this story.
p337
aVAnd you, in your respective communities, all have a Muslim neighbor,
p338
aVcolleague
p339
aVor friend your child plays with at school.
p340
aVReach out to them.
p341
aVLet them know you stand with them in solidarity.
p342
aVIt may feel really small,
p343
aVbut I promise you it makes a difference.
p344
aa(lp345
VNothing will ever bring back Deah, Yusor and Razan.
p346
aVBut when we raise our collective voices,
p347
aVthat is when we stop the hate.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you.
