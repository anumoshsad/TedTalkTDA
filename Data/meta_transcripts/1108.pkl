VAdrian Kohler: Well, we're here today
p4
aVto talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.
p5
aa(lp6
VBasil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution
p7
aVwith a hyena.
p8
aa(lp9
VAK: The ancestor of the horse.
p10
aVOkay, we'll do something with it.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVHahahaha.
p13
aVThe hyena is the ancestor of the horse
p14
aVbecause it was part of a production
p15
aVcalled "Faustus in Africa,"
p16
aVa Handspring Production from 1995,
p17
aVwhere it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
p18
aVThis production was directed
p19
aVby South African artist and theater director,
p20
aVWilliam Kentridge.
p21
aVSo it needed a very articulate front paw.
p22
aVBut, like all puppets, it has other attributes.
p23
aa(lp24
VBJ: One of them is breath,
p25
aVand it kind of breathes.
p26
aa(lp27
VAK: Haa haa haaa.
p28
aa(lp29
VBJ: Breath is really important for us.
p30
aVIt's the kind of original movement
p31
aVfor any puppet for us onstage.
p32
aVIt's the thing that distinguishes the puppet \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
VAK: Oops.
p35
aa(lp36
VBJ: From an actor.
p37
aVPuppets always have to try to be alive.
p38
aVIt's their kind of ur-story onstage,
p39
aVthat desperation to live.
p40
aa(lp41
VAK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,
p42
aVand it only lives
p43
aVbecause you make it.
p44
aVAn actor struggles to die onstage,
p45
aVbut a puppet has to struggle to live.
p46
aVAnd in a way that's a metaphor for life.
p47
aa(lp48
VBJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
p49
aVSo we call this
p50
aVa piece of emotional engineering
p51
aVthat uses up-to-the-minute
p52
aV17th century technology \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVto turn nouns
p55
aVinto verbs.
p56
aa(lp57
VAK: Well actually I prefer to say
p58
aVthat it's an object
p59
aVconstructed out of wood and cloth
p60
aVwith movement built into it
p61
aVto persuade you to believe that it has life.
p62
aa(lp63
VBJ: Okay so.
p64
aa(lp65
VAK: It has ears that move passively
p66
aVwhen the head goes.
p67
aa(lp68
VBJ: And it has these bulkheads
p69
aVmade out of plywood,
p70
aVcovered with fabric \u2014
p71
aVcuriously similar, in fact,
p72
aVto the plywood canoes
p73
aVthat Adrian's father used to make
p74
aVwhen he was a boy in their workshop.
p75
aa(lp76
VAK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.
p77
aa(lp78
VBJ: His mother was a puppeteer.
p79
aVAnd when we met at art school
p80
aVand fell in love
p81
aVin 1971,
p82
aVI hated puppets.
p83
aVI really thought they were so beneath me.
p84
aVI wanted to become an avant-garde artist \u2014
p85
aVand Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.
p86
aVAnd, in fact, it took about 10 years
p87
aa(lp88
Vto discover
p89
aVthe Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,
p90
aVwhere there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,
p91
aVto learn a renewed, or a new, respect
p92
aVfor this art form.
p93
aa(lp94
VAK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine
p95
aVto form a puppet company.
p96
aVAnd 20 years later, miraculously,
p97
aVwe collaborated with a company from Mali,
p98
aVthe Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,
p99
aVwhere we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
p100
aVIt was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
p101
aa(lp102
VBJ: And here again, you see the same structure.
p103
aVThe bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,
p104
aVbut it's ultimately the same structure.
p105
aVIt's got two people inside it on stilts,
p106
aVwhich give them the height,
p107
aVand somebody in the front
p108
aVwho's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.
p109
aa(lp110
VAK: The person in the hind legs
p111
aVis also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena \u2014
p112
aVsame mechanism, just a bit bigger.
p113
aVAnd he's controlling the ear movement.
p114
aa(lp115
VBJ: So this production
p116
aVwas seen by Tom Morris
p117
aVof the National Theatre in London.
p118
aVAnd just around that time,
p119
aVhis mother had said,
p120
aV"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo
p121
aVcalled 'War Horse'?"
p122
aa(lp123
VAK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.
p124
aVThe horse is sold to the First World War,
p125
aVand he joins up to find his horse.
p126
aa(lp127
VBJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,
p128
aV"Do you think you could make us a horse
p129
aVfor a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
p130
aa(lp131
VAK: It seemed a lovely idea.
p132
aa(lp133
VBJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
p134
aa(lp135
VAK: It had to have a rider,
p136
aVand it had to participate in cavalry charges.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVA play about early 20th century plowing technology
p139
aVand cavalry charges
p140
aVwas a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department
p141
aVat the National Theatre in London.
p142
aVBut they agreed to go along with it for a while.
p143
aVSo we began with a test.
p144
aa(lp145
VBJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,
p146
aVwho went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,
p147
aVand our next-door neighbor Katherine,
p148
aVriding on a ladder.
p149
aVThe weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.
p150
aa(lp151
VAK: And once we put Katherine
p152
aVthrough that particular brand of hell,
p153
aVwe knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
p154
aVSo we made a model.
p155
aVThis is a cardboard model,
p156
aVa little bit smaller than the hyena.
p157
aVYou'll notice that the legs are plywood legs
p158
aVand the canoe structure is still there.
p159
aa(lp160
VBJ: And the two manipulators are inside.
p161
aVBut we didn't realize at the time
p162
aVthat we actually needed a third manipulator,
p163
aVbecause we couldn't manipulate the neck
p164
aVfrom inside
p165
aVand walk the horse at the same time.
p166
aa(lp167
VAK: We started work on the prototype
p168
aVafter the model was approved,
p169
aVand the prototype took a bit longer
p170
aVthan we anticipated.
p171
aVWe had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
p172
aVAnd we had a crate built for it.
p173
aVIt had to be shipped to London.
p174
aVWe were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,
p175
aVand it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.
p176
aa(lp177
VBJ: So we got a camera,
p178
aVand we posed the puppet
p179
aVin various galloping stances.
p180
aVAnd we sent it off
p181
aVto the National Theatre,
p182
aVhoping that they believed
p183
aVthat we created something that worked.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VAK: A month later, we were there in London
p187
aVwith this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
p188
aa(lp189
VBJ: About 40 people.
p190
aa(lp191
VAK: We were terrified.
p192
aVWe opened the lid, we took the horse out,
p193
aVand it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
p194
aVHere I have an 18-second clip
p195
aVof the very first walk of the prototype.
p196
aVThis is in the National Theatre studio,
p197
aVthe place where they cook new ideas.
p198
aVIt had by no means got the green light yet.
p199
aVThe choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,
p200
aVinvented a beautiful sequence
p201
aVwhere the baby horse,
p202
aVwhich was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,
p203
aVgrew up into the big horse.
p204
aVAnd Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,
p205
aVsaw that particular moment, he was standing next to me \u2014 he nearly wet himself.
p206
aVAnd so the show was given the green light.
p207
aVAnd we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.
p208
aVHere is the plan.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd here is our factory in Cape Town
p213
aVwhere we make horses.
p214
aVYou can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
p215
aVThe horses are completely handmade.
p216
aVThere is very little 20th century technology in them.
p217
aVWe used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood
p218
aVand some of the aluminum pieces.
p219
aVBut because they have to be light and flexible,
p220
aVand each one of them is different,
p221
aVthey can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.
p222
aVSo here are some half-finished horses
p223
aVready to be worked in London.
p224
aVAnd now we would like to introduce you
p225
aVto Joey.
p226
aVJoey boy, you there?
p227
aVJoey.
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aVJoey.
p231
aVJoey, come here.
p232
aVNo, no, I haven't got it.
p233
aVHe's got it; it's in his pocket.
p234
aa(lp235
VBJ: Joey.
p236
aVAK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
p237
aVCome here. Stand here where people can see you.
p238
aVMove around. Come on.
p239
aVI'd just like to describe \u2014
p240
aVI won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.
p241
aVHere, Craig is working the head.
p242
aVHe has bicycle brake cables
p243
aVgoing down to the head control in his hand.
p244
aVEach one of them
p245
aVoperates either an ear, separately,
p246
aVor the head, up and down.
p247
aVBut he also controls the head directly
p248
aVby using his hand.
p249
aVThe ears are obviously
p250
aVa very important emotional indicator of the horse.
p251
aVWhen they point right back,
p252
aVthe horse is fearful or angry,
p253
aVdepending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.
p254
aVOr, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down
p255
aVand the ears listen, either side.
p256
aVHorses' hearing is very important.
p257
aVIt's almost more important than their eyesight.
p258
aVOver here,
p259
aVTommy's got what you call the heart position.
p260
aVHe's working the leg.
p261
aVYou see the string tendon from the hyena,
p262
aVthe hyena's front leg,
p263
aVautomatically pulls the hoop up.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVHorses are so unpredictable.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVThe way a hoof comes up with a horse
p268
aVimmediately gives you the feeling
p269
aVthat it's a convincing horse action.
p270
aVThe hind legs have got the same action.
p271
aa(lp272
VBJ: And Mikey also has,
p273
aVin his fingers,
p274
aVthe ability to move the tail
p275
aVfrom left to right,
p276
aVand up and down with the other hand.
p277
aVAnd together, there's quite a complex possibility
p278
aVof tail expression.
p279
aa(lp280
VAK: You want to say something about the breathing?
p281
aa(lp282
VBJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
p283
aVAdrian thought
p284
aVthat he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two
p285
aVand make it breathe like that \u2014
p286
aVbecause that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
p287
aVBut we realized
p288
aVthat, if that were to be happening,
p289
aVyou wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.
p290
aVSo he made a channel in here,
p291
aVand the chest moves up and down in that channel.
p292
aVSo it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,
p293
aVbut it feels like breath.
p294
aVAnd it's very, very simple
p295
aVbecause all that happens
p296
aVis that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.
p297
aa(lp298
VAK: Other emotional stuff.
p299
aVIf I were to touch the horse here
p300
aVon his skin,
p301
aVthe heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside
p302
aVand get the skin to quiver.
p303
aVYou'll notice, of course,
p304
aVthat the puppet is made out of cane lines.
p305
aVAnd I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,
p306
aVthat I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse
p307
aVthat somehow moves in space.
p308
aVBut of course, it was the cane is light,
p309
aVthe cane is flexible, the cane is durable
p310
aVand the cane is moldable.
p311
aVAnd so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe skin itself
p314
aVis made out of a see-through nylon mesh,
p315
aVwhich, if the lighting designer
p316
aVwants the horse to almost disappear,
p317
aVshe can light the background
p318
aVand the horse becomes ghostlike.
p319
aVYou see the skeletal structure of it.
p320
aVOr if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.
p321
aVAgain, that was a practical consideration.
p322
aVThe guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.
p323
aVThey have to be able to act
p324
aValong with their fellow actors in the production.
p325
aVAnd it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
p326
aVIt's three heads making one character.
p327
aa(lp328
VBut now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.
p329
aVAnd plant.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Whinny)
p332
aa(lp333
VThank you.
p334
aVAnd now just \u2014
p335
aV(Applause)
p336
aVAll the way from sunny California
p337
aVwe have Zem Joaquin
p338
aVwho's going to ride the horse for us.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
V(Music)
p345
aa(lp346
VSo we would like to stress
p347
aVthat the performance you see in the horse
p348
aVis three guys
p349
aVwho have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.
p350
aa(lp351
VBJ: Not being able to talk to one another
p352
aVwhile they're onstage
p353
aVbecause they're mic'd.
p354
aVThe sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse \u2014
p355
aVthe whinnying and the nickering and everything \u2014
p356
aVthat starts usually with one performer,
p357
aVcarries on with a second person
p358
aVand ends with a third.
p359
aa(lp360
VAK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aVMikey Brett, Craig, Leo,
p363
aVZem Joaquin and Basil and me.
p364
aa(lp365

p366
aa(lp367
