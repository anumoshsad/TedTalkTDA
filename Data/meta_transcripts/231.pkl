VI'm going to go right into the slides.
p4
aVAnd all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides
p5
aVis that I do just very straight stuff.
p6
aVAnd my ideas are \u2014
p7
aVin my head, anyway \u2014 they're very logical
p8
aVand relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.
p9
aVI either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,
p10
aVor I really do solve their problems,
p11
aVbecause usually they seem to like it.
p12
aa(lp13
VLet me go right into the slides.
p14
aVCan you turn off the light? Down.
p15
aVI like to be in the dark.
p16
aVI don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,
p21
aVand it got a lot of notoriety.
p22
aVIn fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,
p23
aVwhich is the slide on the right.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is in Venice.
p28
aVI just show it because I want you to know
p29
aVI'm concerned about context.
p30
aVOn the left-hand side,
p31
aVI had the context of those little houses,
p32
aVand I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
p33
aVWhen people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
p34
aVthey look really weird,
p35
aVand my premise is that they make a lot more sense
p36
aVwhen they're photographed or seen in that space.
p37
aVAnd then, once I deal with the context,
p38
aVI then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,
p39
aVas I hope you'll find that slide on the right.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
p42
aVI was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
p43
aVAnd we continue to work with this client.
p44
aVThe building on the right at the top is now under construction.
p45
aVThe garage on the right \u2014 the gray structure \u2014 will be torn down,
p46
aVfinally, and several small classrooms will be placed
p47
aValong this avenue that we've created, this campus.
p48
aVAnd it all related to the clients and the students
p49
aVfrom the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
p50
aVThey wanted a sense of place.
p51
aVAnd so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
p52
aVin downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
p53
aVAnd it was my theory, or my point of view,
p54
aVthat one didn't upstage the neighborhood \u2014
p55
aVone made accommodations.
p56
aVI tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,
p57
aVwhether they were buildings I liked or not.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn the '60s I started working with paper furniture
p60
aVand made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.
p61
aVWe even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.
p62
aVAnd the success of it threw me for a loop.
p63
aVI couldn't deal with the success of furniture \u2014
p64
aVI wasn't secure enough as an architect \u2014
p65
aVand so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, nobody would like this.
p70
aVAnd it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,
p71
aVthat Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.
p72
aVAnd after we failed, I just kept failing.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VThe piece on the left \u2014
p77
aVand that ultimately led to the piece on the right \u2014
p78
aVhappened when the kid that was working on this
p79
aVtook one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up
p80
aVto put it in the wastebasket.
p81
aVAnd I put a piece of tape around it,
p82
aVas you see there, and realized you could sit on it,
p83
aVand it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
p84
aVSo, it was an accidental discovery.
p85
aa(lp86
VI got into fish.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VI mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism \u2014 at po-mo \u2014
p91
aVand said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,
p92
aVand if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.
p93
aVAnd so I started making these funny things.
p94
aVAnd they started to have a life of their own and got bigger \u2014
p95
aVas the one glass at the Walker.
p96
aVAnd then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything
p97
aVand tried to translate what I was learning
p98
aVabout the form of the fish and the movement.
p99
aVAnd a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it \u2014
p100
aVaccidental, again \u2014
p101
aVit was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,
p102
aVand made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.
p103
aa(lp104
VI did this building in Japan.
p105
aVI was taken out to dinner after the contract
p106
aVfor this little restaurant was signed.
p107
aVAnd I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.
p108
aVAnd after I got \u2014 I was really drunk \u2014
p109
aVI was asked to do some sketches on napkins.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd I made some sketches on napkins \u2014
p114
aVlittle boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.
p115
aVAnd the client said, "Why no fish?"
p116
aVAnd so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.
p117
aVThree weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings
p118
aVsaying we'd won the competition.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,
p123
aVbecause they're so beautiful \u2014 perfect \u2014
p124
aVinto a building or object like this.
p125
aVAnd Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,
p126
aVtold me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.
p127
aVBut he was right \u2014 I couldn't do the tail.
p128
aVI started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.
p129
aVIt was pretty hard.
p130
aVThe thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
p131
aVAnd I put them together, and you walk between them.
p132
aVIt was a dialog with the context again.
p133
aVNow, if you saw a picture of this
p134
aVas it was published in Architectural Record \u2014
p135
aVthey didn't show the context, so you would think,
p136
aV"God, what a pushy guy this is."
p137
aVBut a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here
p138
aVlooking for this restaurant.
p139
aVCouldn't find it.
p140
aVSo ...
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAs for craft and technology and all those things
p145
aVthat you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.
p146
aVThis was built in six months.
p147
aVThe way we sent drawings to Japan:
p148
aVwe used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,
p149
aVand we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
p150
aVWe made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
p151
aVAnd when I got there, everything was perfect \u2014
p152
aVexcept the tail.
p153
aVSo, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.
p156
aVAnd it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.
p157
aVAnd then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,
p158
aVasked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
p159
aVFor reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.
p160
aVToxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.
p161
aVAnd so we built a temporary building \u2014 I'm getting good at temporary \u2014
p162
aVand we put a conference room in that's a fish.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
p165
aVAnd there is a story \u2014 it's a real story \u2014 about my grandmother
p166
aVbuying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,
p167
aVputting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
p168
aVI played with it in the evening.
p169
aVWhen I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.
p170
aVAnd the next night, we had gefilte fish.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd so I set up this interior for Jay's offices
p175
aVand I made a pedestal for a sculpture.
p176
aVAnd he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.
p177
aVI went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,
p178
aVand I put the fish in.
p179
aVIt was a joke.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.
p184
aVWe've been friends for a long time.
p185
aVAnd we've started to work on things.
p186
aVA few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,
p187
aVcalled "Il Corso del Coltello" \u2014 the Swiss Army knife.
p188
aVAnd most of the imagery is \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VClaes', but those two little boys are my sons,
p193
aVand they were Claes' assistants in the play.
p194
aVHe was the Swiss Army knife.
p195
aVHe was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,
p196
aVand I was Frankie P. Toronto.
p197
aVP for Palladio.
p198
aVDressed up like the AT&T building by Claes \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
Vwith a fish hat.
p203
aVThe highlight of the performance was at the end.
p204
aVThis beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,
p205
aVwhich I get credit for participating in.
p206
aVAnd I can tell you \u2014 it's totally an Oldenburg.
p207
aVI had nothing to do with it.
p208
aVThe only thing I did was, I made it possible for them
p209
aVto turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,
p210
aVbecause I love sailing.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VWe made it into a sailing craft.
p215
aa(lp216
VI've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.
p217
aVI do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,
p218
aVwhen things are made in such great quantities,
p219
aVabsorbed in such great quantities,
p220
aVand there's so much denial about them.
p221
aVPeople hate it.
p222
aVAnd I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture \u2014
p223
aVit's one of those materials.
p224
aVAnd I'm always drawn to that.
p225
aVAnd so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,
p226
aVwhich nobody will forgive me for.
p227
aVBut Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
p228
aVAnd that chain link is really expensive.
p229
aVIt's in perspective and everything.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd then we did a camp together for children with cancer.
p232
aVAnd you can see, we started making a building together.
p233
aVOf course, the milk can is his.
p234
aVBut we were trying to collide our ideas,
p235
aVto put objects next to each other.
p236
aVLike a Morandi \u2014 like the little bottles \u2014 composing them like a still life.
p237
aVAnd it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.
p238
aa(lp239
VThen Jay Chiat asked me to do this building
p240
aVon this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,
p241
aVand you entered in the middle.
p242
aVAnd Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.
p243
aVAnd he pushed that.
p244
aVAnd one day I had a \u2014 oh, well, the other way.
p245
aVI had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,
p246
aVand I could never get rid of them after that.
p247
aVOldenburg made the binoculars incredible
p248
aVwhen he sent me the first model of the real proposal.
p249
aVIt made my building look sick.
p250
aVAnd it was this interaction between
p251
aVthat kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
p252
aVIt led to the building on the left.
p253
aVAnd I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,
p254
aVleaving out the \u2014 what the hell.
p255
aa(lp256
VI use a lot of metal in my work,
p257
aVand I have a hard time connecting with the craft.
p258
aVThe whole thing about my house,
p259
aVthe whole use of rough carpentry and everything,
p260
aVwas the frustration with the crafts available.
p261
aVI said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,
p262
aVI'll use the craft I can get."
p263
aVThere were plenty of models for that,
p264
aVin Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists
p265
aVwho were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
p266
aVI went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
p267
aVthat was a sculpture.
p268
aVAnd it was all of one material,
p269
aVand the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
p270
aVThe metalworkers, for the most part,
p271
aVdo ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.
p272
aVI was given an opportunity to design an exhibit
p273
aVfor the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,
p274
aVand I did it on the condition that they become my partners
p275
aVin the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.
p276
aVAnd it's working very well
p277
aVto have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.
p278
aVI just tell the stories.
p279
aVIt's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people
p280
aVthat are so important to the realization of architecture.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe metal continued into a building \u2014 Herman Miller, in Sacramento.
p283
aVAnd it's just a complex of factory buildings.
p284
aVAnd Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place \u2014
p285
aVa people place.
p286
aVI mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,
p287
aVbut it is real that they wanted to have a central place
p288
aVwhere the cafeteria would be, where the people would come
p289
aVand where the people working would interact.
p290
aVSo it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.
p291
aVIt's copper and galvanize.
p292
aVI used the galvanize and copper
p293
aVin a very light gauge, so it would buckle.
p294
aVI spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.
p295
aVEverybody's trying to get the panels perfect,
p296
aVand I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.
p297
aVAnd they end up looking like stone.
p298
aVThis is the central area.
p299
aVThere's a ramp.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.
p302
aVStanley was instrumental in my getting this job.
p303
aVAnd when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,
p304
aVasked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.
p305
aVBecause these were ideas that we were talking about,
p306
aVbuilding things next to each other, making \u2014
p307
aVit's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.
p308
aVAnd so Stanley did the little dome thing.
p309
aVAnd we did it over the phone and by fax.
p310
aVHe would send me a fax and show me something.
p311
aVHe'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
p312
aVI told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
p313
aVI don't want the tower."
p314
aVSo he came back with a simpler building,
p315
aVbut he put some funny details on it,
p316
aVand he moved it closer to my building.
p317
aVAnd so I decided to put him in a depression.
p318
aVI put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.
p319
aVAnd so then he put two bridges \u2014 this all happened on the fax,
p320
aVgoing back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.
p321
aVAnd he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.
p322
aVAnd so then I put this big billboard behind it.
p323
aVAnd I call it, "David and Goliath."
p324
aVAnd that's my cafeteria.
p325
aa(lp326
VIn Boston, we had that old building on the left.
p327
aVIt was a very prominent building off the freeway,
p328
aVand we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up
p329
aVand used the kind of \u2014 I thought \u2014 the language of the neighborhood,
p330
aVwhich had these cornices, projecting cornices.
p331
aVMine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,
p332
aVwhich is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.
p333
aVInstead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.
p334
aVWe redid the side of the building
p335
aVand re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.
p336
aVAnd it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,
p337
aVbecause they have very strict kind of design guideline,
p338
aVand they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.
p339
aVThe detailing was very careful with the lead copper
p340
aVand making panels and fitting it tightly
p341
aVinto the fabric of the existing building.
p342
aa(lp343
VIn Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,
p344
aVI did the Hollywood sign going and coming,
p345
aVmade a building out of it, and they built it.
p346
aVI flew in one night and took this picture.
p347
aVBut they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica \u2014
p350
aVa little shopping center.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,
p353
aVin which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.
p354
aVIt's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.
p355
aVAnd the shape fit perfectly.
p356
aVI just joined the points.
p357
aVIn the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.
p358
aVThat solid wall behind it is a pipe chase \u2014 a pipe canyon \u2014
p359
aVand so it was an opportunity that I seized,
p360
aVbecause I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.
p361
aVIt gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
p362
aa(lp363
VThis is a small house somewhere.
p364
aVThey've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.
p365
aVIt's in the West Valley.
p366
aVAnd we started with the stream
p367
aVand built the house along the stream \u2014 dammed it up to make a lake.
p368
aVThese are the models.
p369
aVThe reality, with the lake \u2014
p370
aVthe workmanship is pretty bad.
p371
aVAnd it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.
p372
aVWhen you have to do something really cheaply,
p373
aVit's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
p374
aVThat big metal thing is a passage, and in it is \u2014
p375
aVyou go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,
p376
aVwhich is on the right.
p377
aVIt's kind of like a whole built town.
p378
aa(lp379
VI was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.
p380
aVI thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
p381
aa(lp382
VThis is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.
p383
aVThe owners had a dilemma \u2014 they asked Philip to do it.
p384
aVHe was too busy.
p385
aVHe didn't recommend me, by the way.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VWe ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,
p390
aVhow do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?
p391
aVIs it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?
p392
aVEtc. etc.
p393
aVYou've got the idea.
p394
aVAnd so we finally ended up making it.
p395
aVThese people are art collectors.
p396
aVAnd we finally made it so it appears very sculptural
p397
aVfrom the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
p398
aVAnd the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
p399
aVIt's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply \u2014
p400
aVit's that formed lumber from Finland.
p401
aVWe used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
p402
aVI keep trying to make it work.
p403
aVIn this case we learned how to detail it.
p404
aa(lp405
VIn Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.
p406
aVIt's never been finished.
p407
aVGoing out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.
p408
aVAnd we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
p409
aVThere's a railroad track.
p410
aVThis is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.
p411
aVAnd the centerline of the mall goes out.
p412
aVBurnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,
p413
aVand so we followed.
p414
aVSohio is on the axis here,
p415
aVand we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.
p416
aVAnd this is our building,
p417
aVwhich is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.
p418
aVWe collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.
p419
aVThe health club is fastened to the garage
p420
aVwith a C-clamp, for Cleveland.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VYou drive down.
p425
aVSo it's about a 10-story C-clamp.
p426
aVAnd all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,
p427
aVand an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
p428
aVThis owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
p429
aVAnd this would be a hotel.
p430
aVSo, the centerline of this thing \u2014 we'd preserve it,
p431
aVand it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings
p432
aVby Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
p433
aVIt's hard to do high-rise.
p434
aVI feel much more comfortable down here.
p435
aa(lp436
VThis is a piece of property in Brentwood.
p437
aVAnd a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house \u2014
p438
aVI designed a house for myself
p439
aVthat would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard \u2014
p440
aVand the owner of this lot worked for me
p441
aVand built that actual model on the left.
p442
aVAnd she came back,
p443
aVI guess wealthier or something \u2014 something happened \u2014
p444
aVand asked me to design a house for her on this site.
p445
aVAnd following that basic idea of the village,
p446
aVwe changed it as we got into it.
p447
aVI locked the house into the site by cutting the back end \u2014
p448
aVhere you see on the photographs of the site \u2014
p449
aVslicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
p450
aVlike a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,
p451
aVwhich I designed like a kind of a barge,
p452
aVlooking like a boat.
p453
aVAnd that's it, built.
p454
aVThe dome was a request from the client.
p455
aVShe wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
p456
aVShe didn't care where.
p457
aVWhen you sleep in this bedroom, I hope \u2014
p458
aVI mean, I haven't slept in it yet.
p459
aVI've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,
p460
aVbut she said I didn't have to do that.
p461
aVBut when you're in that room,
p462
aVyou feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
p463
aVAnd it's very private.
p464
aVThe landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
p465
aVAnd then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,
p466
aVand one on the other side.
p467
aa(lp468
VThese aren't focused very well.
p469
aVI don't know how to do it from here.
p470
aVFocus the one on the right.
p471
aVIt's up there.
p472
aVLeft \u2014 it's my right.
p473
aa(lp474
VAnyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.
p475
aVThat's the living room.
p476
aVServants' quarters.
p477
aVA guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
p478
aVAnd then you enter into the living room and then so on.
p479
aVThis is the bedroom.
p480
aVYou come down from this level along the stairway,
p481
aVand you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
p482
aVAnd the bed is back in this space,
p483
aVwith windows looking out onto the lake.
p484
aVThese Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground
p485
aVand to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
p486
aVThe material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
p487
aVAnd so it was an intent to make this small piece of land \u2014
p488
aVit's 100 by 250 \u2014 into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
p489
aVand making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
p490
aVwith a high space in it.
p491
aVAnd this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
p492
aVwith the dining room table.
p493
aVIt looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
p494
aVBut the idea is, the windows are all placed
p495
aVso you see pieces of the house outside.
p496
aVEventually this will be screened \u2014 these trees will come up \u2014
p497
aVand it will be very private.
p498
aVAnd you feel like you're in your own kind of village.
p499
aa(lp500
VThis is for Michael Eisner \u2014 Disney.
p501
aVWe're doing some work for him.
p502
aa(lp503
VAnd this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.
p504
aVYou go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,
p505
aVand there's another bridge here.
p506
aVAnd you're through this room in a split second,
p507
aVand the building will sort of reflect that.
p508
aVOn the backside, it's much more humane \u2014 entrance,
p509
aVdining hall, etc.
p510
aVAnd then this thing here \u2014 I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear
p511
aVthe picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.
p512
aVKind of a fun thing to do.
p513
aa(lp514
VI'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,
p515
aVwhich is an office building for a furniture company.
p516
aVAnd we struggled with the image.
p517
aVThese are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture
p518
aVto normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,
p519
aVthen people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,
p520
aVbut no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."
p521
aVSo we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,
p522
aVand we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them
p523
aVso that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
p524
aVAnd you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of
p525
aVinteraction between these pieces.
p526
aa(lp527
VThis is in Paris, along the Seine.
p528
aVPalais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.
p529
aVThe Minister of Finance \u2014 the guy that moved from the Louvre \u2014 goes in here.
p530
aVThere's a new library across the river.
p531
aVAnd back in here, in this already treed park,
p532
aVwe're doing a very dense building called the American Center,
p533
aVwhich has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,
p534
aVrestaurants and all kinds of \u2014 it's a very dense program \u2014
p535
aVbookstores, etc.
p536
aVIn a very tight, small \u2014
p537
aVthis is the ground level.
p538
aVAnd the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up
p539
aVby taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.
p540
aVThey call it the plan coupe.
p541
aVAnd I struggled with that thing \u2014
p542
aVhow to get around the corner.
p543
aa(lp544
VThese are the models for it.
p545
aVI showed you the other model, the one \u2014
p546
aVthis is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing \u2014
p547
aVso I understood the problem.
p548
aVI was trying to get around this plan coupe \u2014 how do you do it?
p549
aVApartments, etc.
p550
aVAnd these are the kind of study models we did.
p551
aVAnd the one on the left is pretty awful.
p552
aVYou can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
p553
aVBut out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece
p554
aVworked frontally to this, parallel to this street,
p555
aVand also parallel to here.
p556
aVAnd then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,
p557
aVkind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.
p558
aVThe restaurants here \u2014 the apartments and the theater, etc.
p559
aVSo it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,
p560
aVexcept for this metal piece.
p561
aVAnd it faces into a park.
p562
aVAnd the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
p563
aVOn the side facing the street it's much more normal,
p564
aVexcept I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,
p565
aVthese housing units made a gesture to the corner.
p566
aVAnd this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.
p567
aVIf any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.
p568
aVI don't know what to do.
p569
aa(lp570
VJay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me
p571
aVto do a house for him in the Hamptons.
p572
aVAnd it's got a fish.
p573
aVAnd I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."
p574
aVIt's like a drug addict.
p575
aVI say, "I'm not going to do it anymore \u2014 I don't want to do it anymore \u2014
p576
aVI'm not going to do it."
p577
aVAnd then I do it.
p578
aa(lp579
V(Laughter)
p580
aa(lp581
VThere it is.
p582
aVBut it's the living room.
p583
aVAnd this piece here is \u2014
p584
aVI don't know what it is.
p585
aVI just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget
p586
aVso we could take something out.
p587
aa(lp588
V(Applause)
p589
aa(lp590
VThis is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys
p591
aVthat presented to you earlier.
p592
aVWe've had a lot of fun working together.
p593
aVI think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,
p594
aVbut somehow we all manage to work together,
p595
aVand I think, productively.
p596
aVSo far.
p597
aVThis is a shopping thing.
p598
aVYou come into the Magic Kingdom
p599
aVand the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.
p600
aVAnd then this is a kind of a shopping mall,
p601
aVwith a rodeo and restaurants.
p602
aVAnd another restaurant.
p603
aVWhat I did \u2014 because of the Paris skies being quite dull,
p604
aVI made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,
p605
aVto the route of the train.
p606
aVIt looks like it's kind of been there,
p607
aVand then crashed all these simpler forms into it.
p608
aVThe light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a
p609
aVkind of light ceiling.
p610
aVIn Switzerland \u2014 Germany, actually \u2014 on the Rhine across from Basel,
p611
aVwe did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.
p612
aa(lp613
VAnd I tried to \u2014 there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,
p614
aVthere's an Oldenburg sculpture over here \u2014
p615
aVI tried to make a relationship urbanistically.
p616
aVAnd I don't gave good slides to show \u2014 it's just been completed \u2014
p617
aVbut this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.
p618
aVAnd as you pass by it's always part \u2014 you see it as all of these pieces
p619
aVaccrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.
p620
aVIt's plaster and just zinc.
p621
aVAnd you wonder, if this is a museum,
p622
aVwhat it's going to be like inside?
p623
aVIf it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,
p624
aVand just wait.
p625
aVI'm so cunning and clever \u2014 I made it quiet and wonderful.
p626
aVBut on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
p627
aVIt's actually basically three square rooms
p628
aVwith a couple of skylights and stuff.
p629
aVAnd from the building in the back, you see it as
p630
aVan iceberg floating by in the hills.
p631
aVI know I'm over time.
p632
aVSee, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.
p633
aVSo it's pretty quiet inside.
p634
aa(lp635
VThis is the Disney Hall \u2014 the concert hall.
p636
aVIt's a complicated project.
p637
aVIt has a chamber hall.
p638
aVIt's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built
p639
aVwith a lot of love and tears and caring.
p640
aVAnd it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,
p641
aVthat we would make a compositional relationship between us
p642
aVthat would strengthen both of us.
p643
aVAnd the plan of this \u2014 it's a concert hall.
p644
aVThis is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
p645
aVThere's commercial at the ground floor.
p646
aVThese are offices, which, really, in the competition,
p647
aVwe didn't have to design.
p648
aVBut finally, there's a hotel there.
p649
aVThese were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,
p650
aVcomposing these elevations together and relating them
p651
aVto the buildings that existed \u2014 to MOCA, etc.
p652
aa(lp653
VThe acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,
p654
aVwhich led to this compartmentalized scheme,
p655
aVwhich we found out after the competition would not work at all.
p656
aVBut everybody liked these forms and liked the space,
p657
aVand so that's one of the problems of a competition.
p658
aVYou have to then try and get that back in some way.
p659
aVAnd we studied many models.
p660
aVThis was our original model.
p661
aVThese were the three buildings that were the ideal \u2014
p662
aVthe Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
p663
aVEverybody liked the surround.
p664
aVActually, this is the smallest hall in size,
p665
aVand it has more seats than any of these
p666
aVbecause it has double balconies.
p667
aVOur client doesn't want balconies, so \u2014
p668
aVand when we met our new acoustician, he told us
p669
aVthis was the right shape or this was the right shape.
p670
aVAnd we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy
p671
aVof the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.
p672
aVWe finally settled on a shape that was
p673
aVthe proportion of the Concertgebouw
p674
aVwith the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said
p675
aVwere crucial to this and later decided they weren't,
p676
aVbut now we have them.
p677
aa(lp678
V(Laughter)
p679
aa(lp680
VAnd our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural
p681
aVand out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
p682
aVThat's the idea.
p683
aVAnd the corners would have skylights
p684
aVand these columns would be structural.
p685
aVAnd the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a
p686
aVkind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,
p687
aVand create intimacy.
p688
aVNow, this is not a final design \u2014 these are just on the way to being \u2014
p689
aVand so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
p690
aVWe studied the acoustics with laser stuff,
p691
aVand they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
p692
aVBut you get the sense of the hall in section.
p693
aVMost halls come straight down into a proscenium.
p694
aVIn this case we're opening it back up
p695
aVand getting skylights in the four corners.
p696
aVAnd so it will be quite a different shape.
p697
aa(lp698
V(Laughter)
p699
aa(lp700
VThe original building, because it was frog-like,
p701
aVfit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.
p702
aVWhen you get into a box, it's harder to do it \u2014 and here we are,
p703
aVstruggling with how to put the hotel in.
p704
aVAnd this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.
p705
aVI just stuck it on there.
p706
aVBut this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it
p707
aVand struggle with it and cut it away.
p708
aVAnd of course it's not going to look like that,
p709
aVbut it is the crazy way I tend to work.
p710
aa(lp711
VAnd then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture
p712
aVat the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.
p713
aVLarry Halprin is doing the stairs.
p714
aVAnd I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.
p715
aa(lp716
V(Laughter)
p717
aa(lp718
VIt's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,
p719
aVand you can go in it.
p720
aVIt's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,
p721
aVand it works much better than a fish.
p722
aa(lp723
VIn Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that,
p724
aVat the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by
p725
aVSkidmore, Owings and Merrill.
p726
aVAnd the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,
p727
aVnon-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
p728
aVAnd so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,
p729
aVperverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of
p730
aVa 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit \u2014
p731
aVthis is the beach and the harbor out in front,
p732
aVand this is really a shopping center with department stores.
p733
aVAnd we split these bridges.
p734
aVOriginally, this was all solid with a hole in it.
p735
aVWe cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of
p736
aVa foreground for this hotel.
p737
aVWe showed this to the hotel people the other day,
p738
aVand they were terrified and said that nobody would come
p739
aVto the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
p740
aa(lp741
V(Laughter)
p742
aa(lp743
VAnd finally, I just threw these in \u2014 Lou Danziger.
p744
aVI didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,
p745
aVbut this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.
p746
aVA little studio \u2014 and it's sadly for sale.
p747
aVTime goes on.
p748
aa(lp749
VAnd this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
p750
aVHe designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,
p751
aVand I did the rest of it.
p752
aVAnd the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
p753
aVIt should have been the other way around \u2014
p754
aVthe food should have been good first.
p755
aVIt didn't work.
p756
