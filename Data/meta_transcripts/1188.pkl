VSo I begin with an advertisement
p4
aVinspired by George Orwell
p5
aVthat Apple ran in 1984.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Video) Big Brother: We are one people
p8
aVwith one will, one resolve,
p9
aVone cause.
p10
aVOur enemies shall talk themselves to death,
p11
aVand we will fight them with their own confusion.
p12
aVWe shall prevail.
p13
aVNarrator: On January 24th,
p14
aVApple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
p15
aVAnd you'll see why 1984
p16
aVwon't be like "1984."
p17
aa(lp18
VRebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video
p19
aVremains very powerful even today.
p20
aVTechnology created by innovative companies
p21
aVwill set us all free.
p22
aVFast-forward more than two decades:
p23
aVApple launches the iPhone in China
p24
aVand censors the Dalai Lama out
p25
aValong with several other politically sensitive applications
p26
aVat the request of the Chinese government
p27
aVfor its Chinese app store.
p28
aVThe American political cartoonist
p29
aVMark Fiore
p30
aValso had his satire application
p31
aVcensored in the United States
p32
aVbecause some of Apple's staff
p33
aVwere concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
p34
aVHis app wasn't reinstated
p35
aVuntil he won the Pulitzer Prize.
p36
aVThe German magazine Stern, a news magazine,
p37
aVhad its app censored
p38
aVbecause the Apple nannies deemed it
p39
aVto be a little bit too racy for their users,
p40
aVand despite the fact that this magazine
p41
aVis perfectly legal for sale
p42
aVon newsstands throughout Germany.
p43
aVAnd more controversially, recently,
p44
aVApple censored a Palestinian protest app
p45
aVafter the Israeli government voiced concerns
p46
aVthat it might be used to organize violent attacks.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo here's the thing.
p49
aVWe have a situation where private companies
p50
aVare applying censorship standards
p51
aVthat are often quite arbitrary
p52
aVand generally more narrow
p53
aVthan the free speech constitutional standards
p54
aVthat we have in democracies.
p55
aVOr they're responding to censorship requests
p56
aVby authoritarian regimes
p57
aVthat do not reflect consent of the governed.
p58
aVOr they're responding to requests and concerns
p59
aVby governments that have no jurisdiction
p60
aVover many, or most, of the users and viewers
p61
aVwho are interacting with the content in question.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo here's the situation.
p64
aVIn a pre-Internet world,
p65
aVsovereignty over our physical freedoms,
p66
aVor lack thereof,
p67
aVwas controlled almost entirely
p68
aVby nation-states.
p69
aVBut now we have this new layer
p70
aVof private sovereignty
p71
aVin cyberspace.
p72
aVAnd their decisions about software coding,
p73
aVengineering, design, terms of service
p74
aVall act as a kind of law
p75
aVthat shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
p76
aVAnd their sovereignties,
p77
aVcross-cutting, globally interlinked,
p78
aVcan in some ways
p79
aVchallenge the sovereignties of nation-states
p80
aVin very exciting ways,
p81
aVbut sometimes also act
p82
aVto project and extend it
p83
aVat a time when control
p84
aVover what people can and cannot do
p85
aVwith information
p86
aVhas more effect than ever
p87
aVon the exercise of power
p88
aVin our physical world.
p89
aVAfter all, even the leader of the free world
p90
aVneeds a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan
p91
aVif he wants to get reelected next year.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd these platforms
p94
aVwere certainly very helpful
p95
aVto activists in Tunisia and Egypt
p96
aVthis past spring and beyond.
p97
aVAs Wael Ghonim,
p98
aVthe Google-Egyptian-executive by day,
p99
aVsecret-Facebook-activist by night,
p100
aVfamously said to CNN
p101
aVafter Mubarak stepped down,
p102
aV"If you want to liberate a society,
p103
aVjust give them the Internet."
p104
aVBut overthrowing a government is one thing
p105
aVand building a stable democracy
p106
aVis a bit more complicated.
p107
aVOn the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist
p108
aVwho was part of the storming
p109
aVof the Egyptian state security offices in March.
p110
aVAnd many of the agents
p111
aVshredded as many of the documents as they could
p112
aVand left them behind in piles.
p113
aVBut some of the files were left behind intact,
p114
aVand activists, some of them,
p115
aVfound their own surveillance dossiers
p116
aVfull of transcripts of their email exchanges,
p117
aVtheir cellphone text message exchanges,
p118
aVeven Skype conversations.
p119
aVAnd one activist actually found
p120
aVa contract from a Western company
p121
aVfor the sale of surveillance technology
p122
aVto the Egyptian security forces.
p123
aVAnd Egyptian activists are assuming
p124
aVthat these technologies for surveillance
p125
aVare still being used
p126
aVby the transitional authorities running the networks there.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May \u2014
p129
aVnot nearly as extensively
p130
aVas under President Ben Ali.
p131
aVBut you'll see here a blocked page
p132
aVof what happens when you try to reach
p133
aVcertain Facebook pages and some other websites
p134
aVthat the transitional authorities
p135
aVhave determined might incite violence.
p136
aVIn protest over this,
p137
aVblogger Slim Amamou,
p138
aVwho had been jailed under Ben Ali
p139
aVand then became part of the transitional government
p140
aVafter the revolution,
p141
aVhe resigned in protest from the cabinet.
p142
aVBut there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia
p143
aVabout how to handle this kind of problem.
p144
aa(lp145
VIn fact, on Twitter,
p146
aVthere were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution
p147
aVwho said, "Well actually,
p148
aVwe do want democracy and free expression,
p149
aVbut there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds
p150
aVbecause it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
p151
aVBut the problem is,
p152
aVhow do you decide who is in power to make these decisions
p153
aVand how do you make sure
p154
aVthat they do not abuse their power?
p155
aVAs Riadh Guerfali,
p156
aVthe veteran digital activist from Tunisia,
p157
aVremarked over this incident,
p158
aV"Before, things were simple:
p159
aVyou had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
p160
aVToday, things are a lot more subtle."
p161
aVWelcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe reality is
p164
aVthat even in democratic societies today,
p165
aVwe do not have good answers
p166
aVfor how you balance the need
p167
aVfor security and law enforcement on one hand
p168
aVand protection of civil liberties
p169
aVand free speech on the other
p170
aVin our digital networks.
p171
aVIn fact, in the United States,
p172
aVwhatever you may think of Julian Assange,
p173
aVeven people who are not necessarily big fans of his
p174
aVare very concerned about the way
p175
aVin which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
p176
aVAmazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer
p177
aVafter receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,
p178
aVdespite the fact
p179
aVthat Wikileaks had not been charged,
p180
aVlet alone convicted,
p181
aVof any crime.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo we assume
p184
aVthat the Internet is a border-busting technology.
p185
aVThis is a map of social networks worldwide,
p186
aVand certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world \u2014
p187
aVwhich is either a good or a bad thing,
p188
aVdepending on how you like
p189
aVthe way Facebook manages its service.
p190
aVBut borders do persist
p191
aVin some parts of cyberspace.
p192
aVIn Brazil and Japan,
p193
aVit's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
p194
aVBut if you look at China, Vietnam
p195
aVand a number of the former Soviet states,
p196
aVwhat's happening there is more troubling.
p197
aVYou have a situation
p198
aVwhere the relationship between government
p199
aVand local social networking companies
p200
aVis creating a situation
p201
aVwhere, effectively,
p202
aVthe empowering potential of these platforms
p203
aVis being constrained
p204
aVbecause of these relationships
p205
aVbetween companies and government.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow in China,
p208
aVyou have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,
p209
aVthat blocks Facebook
p210
aVand Twitter and now Google+
p211
aVand many of the other overseas websites.
p212
aVAnd that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
p213
aVBut that's only half of the story.
p214
aVThe other part of the story
p215
aVare requirements that the Chinese government places
p216
aVon all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,
p217
aVknown as a system of self-discipline.
p218
aVIn plain English, that means censorship and surveillance
p219
aVof their users.
p220
aVAnd this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009
p221
aVwhere the Internet Society of China presented awards
p222
aVto the top 20 Chinese companies
p223
aVthat are best at exercising self-discipline \u2014
p224
aVi.e. policing their content.
p225
aVAnd Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,
p226
aVChina's dominant search engine,
p227
aVwas one of the recipients.
p228
aa(lp229
VIn Russia, they do not generally block the Internet
p230
aVand directly censor websites.
p231
aVBut this is a website called Rospil
p232
aVthat's an anti-corruption site.
p233
aVAnd earlier this year,
p234
aVthere was a troubling incident
p235
aVwhere people who had made donations to Rospil
p236
aVthrough a payments processing system
p237
aVcalled Yandex Money
p238
aVsuddenly received threatening phone calls
p239
aVfrom members of a nationalist party
p240
aVwho had obtained details
p241
aVabout donors to Rospil
p242
aVthrough members of the security services
p243
aVwho had somehow obtained this information
p244
aVfrom people at Yandex Money.
p245
aVThis has a chilling effect
p246
aVon people's ability to use the Internet
p247
aVto hold government accountable.
p248
aVSo we have a situation in the world today
p249
aVwhere in more and more countries
p250
aVthe relationship between citizens and governments
p251
aVis mediated through the Internet,
p252
aVwhich is comprised primarily
p253
aVof privately owned and operated services.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo the important question, I think,
p256
aVis not this debate over whether the Internet
p257
aVis going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
p258
aVOf course, it's going to empower
p259
aVwhoever is most skilled at using the technology
p260
aVand best understands the Internet
p261
aVin comparison with whoever their adversary is.
p262
aVThe most urgent question we need to be asking today
p263
aVis how do we make sure
p264
aVthat the Internet evolves
p265
aVin a citizen-centric manner.
p266
aVBecause I think all of you will agree
p267
aVthat the only legitimate purpose of government
p268
aVis to serve citizens,
p269
aVand I would argue
p270
aVthat the only legitimate purpose of technology
p271
aVis to improve our lives,
p272
aVnot to manipulate or enslave us.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo the question is,
p275
aVwe know how to hold government accountable.
p276
aVWe don't necessarily always do it very well,
p277
aVbut we have a sense of what the models are,
p278
aVpolitically and institutionally, to do that.
p279
aVHow do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace
p280
aVaccountable to the public interest
p281
aVwhen most CEO's argue
p282
aVthat their main obligation
p283
aVis to maximize shareholder profit?
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd government regulation
p286
aVoften isn't helping all that much.
p287
aVYou have situations, for instance, in France
p288
aVwhere president Sarkozy
p289
aVtells the CEO's of Internet companies,
p290
aV"We're the only legitimate representatives
p291
aVof the public interest."
p292
aVBut then he goes and champions laws
p293
aVlike the infamous "three-strikes" law
p294
aVthat would disconnect citizens from the Internet
p295
aVfor file sharing,
p296
aVwhich has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur
p297
aVon Freedom of Expression
p298
aVas being a disproportionate violation
p299
aVof citizens' right to communications,
p300
aVand has raised questions amongst civil society groups
p301
aVabout whether
p302
aVsome political representatives
p303
aVare more interested in preserving
p304
aVthe interests of the entertainment industry
p305
aVthan they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
p306
aVAnd here in the United Kingdom
p307
aVthere's also concern over
p308
aVa law called the Digital Economy Act
p309
aVthat's placing more onus
p310
aVon private intermediaries
p311
aVto police citizen behavior.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo what we need to recognize
p314
aVis that if we want to have
p315
aVa citizen-centric Internet in the future,
p316
aVwe need a broader and more sustained
p317
aVInternet freedom movement.
p318
aVAfter all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater
p319
aVas a matter of course,
p320
aVor employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,
p321
aVjust because executives woke up one day
p322
aVand decided it was the right thing to do.
p323
aVIt was the result of decades of sustained activism,
p324
aVshareholder advocacy
p325
aVand consumer advocacy.
p326
aVSimilarly, governments don't enact
p327
aVintelligent environmental and labor laws
p328
aVjust because politicians wake up one day.
p329
aVIt's the result of very sustained and prolonged
p330
aVpolitical activism
p331
aVthat you get the right regulations,
p332
aVand that you get the right corporate behavior.
p333
aVWe need to make the same approach
p334
aVwith the Internet.
p335
aa(lp336
VWe also are going to need
p337
aVpolitical innovation.
p338
aVEight hundred years ago, approximately,
p339
aVthe barons of England decided
p340
aVthat the Divine Right of Kings
p341
aVwas no longer working for them so well,
p342
aVand they forced King John
p343
aVto sign the Magna Carta,
p344
aVwhich recognized
p345
aVthat even the king
p346
aVwho claimed to have divine rule
p347
aVstill had to abide by a basic set of rules.
p348
aVThis set off a cycle
p349
aVof what we can call political innovation,
p350
aVwhich led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed \u2014
p351
aVwhich was implemented for the first time
p352
aVby that radical revolutionary government
p353
aVin America across the pond.
p354
aVSo now we need to figure out
p355
aVhow to build consent of the networked.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd what does that look like?
p358
aVAt the moment, we still don't know.
p359
aVBut it's going to require innovation
p360
aVthat's not only going to need
p361
aVto focus on politics,
p362
aVon geopolitics,
p363
aVbut it's also going to need
p364
aVto deal with questions
p365
aVof business management, investor behavior,
p366
aVconsumer choice
p367
aVand even software design and engineering.
p368
aVEach and every one of us has a vital part to play
p369
aVin building the kind of world
p370
aVin which government and technology
p371
aVserve the world's people and not the other way around.
p372
