VLet's talk dirty.
p4
aVA few years ago, oddly enough,
p5
aVI needed the bathroom,
p6
aVand I found one, a public bathroom,
p7
aVand I went into the stall,
p8
aVand I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:
p9
aVuse the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
p10
aVAnd for some reason that day, instead,
p11
aVI asked myself a question,
p12
aVand it was, where does this stuff go?
p13
aVAnd with that question, I found myself plunged
p14
aVinto the world of sanitation \u2014
p15
aVthere's more coming \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p16
aVsanitation, toilets and poop,
p17
aVand I have yet to emerge.
p18
aVAnd that's because it's such an enraging,
p19
aVyet engaging place to be.
p20
aa(lp21
VTo go back to that toilet,
p22
aVit wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,
p23
aVit wasn't as nice as this one
p24
aVfrom the World Toilet Organization.
p25
aVThat's the other WTO. (Laughter)
p26
aVBut it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,
p27
aVit had soap so I could wash my hands,
p28
aVand I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut that day, when I asked that question,
p33
aVI learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking
p34
aVthat a toilet like that was my right,
p35
aVwhen in fact it's a privilege.
p36
aV2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.
p37
aVThey don't have a bucket or a box.
p38
aVForty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
p39
aVAnd they have to do what this little boy is doing
p40
aVby the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,
p41
aVwhich is called open defecation,
p42
aVor poo-pooing in the open.
p43
aVAnd he does that every day,
p44
aVand every day, probably, that guy in the picture
p45
aVwalks on by,
p46
aVbecause he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut he should, because the problem
p49
aVwith all that poop lying around
p50
aVis that poop carries passengers.
p51
aVFifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.
p52
aVAll those things, the eggs, the cysts,
p53
aVthe bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel
p54
aVin one gram of human feces.
p55
aVHow? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.
p56
aVHe's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,
p57
aVand he will contaminate his drinking water and his food
p58
aVand his environment
p59
aVwith whatever diseases he may be carrying
p60
aVby fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.
p61
aVIn what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world
p62
aVthat most of us in this room are lucky to live in,
p63
aVthe most common symptoms associated with those diseases,
p64
aVdiarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.
p65
aVIt's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.
p66
aVWhere I come from, we call it Delhi belly,
p67
aVas a legacy of empire.
p68
aVBut if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea
p69
aVin a leading photo image agency,
p70
aVthis is the picture that you come up with.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVStill not sure about the bikini.
p73
aVAnd here's another image of diarrhea.
p74
aVThis is Marie Saylee, nine months old.
p75
aVYou can't see her, because she's buried
p76
aVunder that green grass in a little village in Liberia,
p77
aVbecause she died in three days from diarrhea \u2014
p78
aVthe Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.
p79
aVAnd that's her dad.
p80
aVBut she wasn't alone that day,
p81
aVbecause 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,
p82
aVand they do every day.
p83
aVDiarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,
p84
aVand you've probably been asked to care about things
p85
aVlike HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,
p86
aVbut diarrhea kills more children
p87
aVthan all those three things put together.
p88
aVIt's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.
p89
aVAnd the cost to the world is immense:
p90
aV260 billion dollars lost every year
p91
aVon the losses to poor sanitation.
p92
aVThese are cholera beds in Haiti.
p93
aVYou'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
p94
aVIt gets a fraction of the attention and funding
p95
aVgiven to any of those other diseases.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut we know how to fix this.
p98
aVWe know, because in the mid-19th century,
p99
aVwonderful Victorian engineers
p100
aVinstalled systems of sewers and wastewater treatment
p101
aVand the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
p102
aVChild mortality dropped by the most
p103
aVit had ever dropped in history.
p104
aVThe flush toilet was voted the best medical advance
p105
aVof the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,
p106
aVand they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,
p107
aVand surgery.
p108
aVIt's a wonderful waste disposal device.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut I think that it's so good \u2014 it doesn't smell,
p111
aVwe can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door \u2014
p112
aVand I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
p113
aVWe don't have a neutral word for it.
p114
aVPoop's not particularly adequate.
p115
aVShit offends people. Feces is too medical.
p116
aa(lp117
VBecause I can't explain otherwise,
p118
aVwhen I look at the figures, what's going on.
p119
aVWe know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,
p120
aVbut if you look at the budgets of countries,
p121
aVdeveloping and developed,
p122
aVyou'll think there's something wrong with the math,
p123
aVbecause you'll expect absurdities like
p124
aVPakistan spending 47 times more on its military
p125
aVthan it does on water and sanitation,
p126
aVeven though 150,000 children die of diarrhea
p127
aVin Pakistan every year.
p128
aVBut then you look at that already minuscule
p129
aVwater and sanitation budget,
p130
aVand 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,
p131
aVwhich is great; we all need water.
p132
aVNo one's going to refuse clean water.
p133
aVBut the humble latrine, or flush toilet,
p134
aVreduces disease by twice as much
p135
aVas just putting in clean water.
p136
aVThink about it. That little boy
p137
aVwho's running back into his house,
p138
aVhe may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,
p139
aVbut he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I think that the real waste of human waste
p142
aVis that we are wasting it as a resource
p143
aVand as an incredible trigger for development,
p144
aVbecause these are a few things that toilets
p145
aVand poop itself can do for us.
p146
aVSo a toilet can put a girl back in school.
p147
aVTwenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school
p148
aVbecause they have no adequate sanitation.
p149
aVThey've been used to sitting through lessons
p150
aVfor years and years holding it in.
p151
aVWe've all done that, but they do it every day,
p152
aVand when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,
p153
aVit just gets too much.
p154
aVAnd I understand that. Who can blame them?
p155
aVSo if you met an educationalist and said,
p156
aV"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent
p157
aVwith just one simple thing,"
p158
aVyou'd make a lot of friends in education.
p159
aa(lp160
VThat's not the only thing it can do for you.
p161
aVPoop can cook your dinner.
p162
aVIt's got nutrients in it.
p163
aVWe ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.
p164
aVWe don't keep them all.
p165
aVIn Rwanda, they are now getting
p166
aV75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system
p167
aVfrom the contents of prisoners' bowels.
p168
aVSo these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.
p169
aVThey're genocidal inmates, most of them,
p170
aVand they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,
p171
aVbecause if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,
p172
aVpretty much like a stomach,
p173
aVthen, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,
p174
aVand you can cook with it.
p175
aVAnd you might think it's just good karma
p176
aVto see these guys stirring shit,
p177
aVbut it's also good economic sense,
p178
aVbecause they're saving a million dollars a year.
p179
aVThey're cutting down on deforestation,
p180
aVand they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,
p181
aVinfinite and free at the point of production.
p182
aa(lp183
VIt's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.
p184
aVHere's a woman who's about to get a dose
p185
aVof the brown stuff in those syringes,
p186
aVwhich is what you think it is,
p187
aVexcept not quite, because it's actually donated.
p188
aVThere is now a new career path called stool donor.
p189
aVIt's like the new sperm donor.
p190
aVBecause she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,
p191
aVand it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
p192
aVShe's been suffering for years.
p193
aVShe gets a dose of healthy human feces,
p194
aVand the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.
p195
aVIt's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.
p196
aVMaybe it's the ick factor.
p197
aVThat's okay, because there's a team of research scientists
p198
aVin Canada who have now created a stool sample,
p199
aVa fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,
p202
aVwe give everyone a toilet.
p203
aVAnd this is where it gets really interesting,
p204
aVbecause it's not that simple, because we are not simple.
p205
aVSo the really interesting, exciting work \u2014
p206
aVthis is the engaging bit \u2014 in sanitation is that
p207
aVwe need to understand human psychology.
p208
aVWe need to understand software
p209
aVas well as just giving someone hardware.
p210
aVThey've found in many developing countries that
p211
aVgovernments have gone in and given out free latrines
p212
aVand gone back a few years later and found that they've
p213
aVgot lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms
p214
aVwith their owners happily walking past them
p215
aVand going over to the open defecating ground.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
p218
aVIt's been done for decades. The soap companies did it
p219
aVin the early 20th century.
p220
aVThey tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
p221
aVThey tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
p222
aVIn India now there's a campaign
p223
aVwhich persuades young brides
p224
aVnot to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
p225
aVIt's called "No Loo, No I Do."
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVAnd in case you think that poster's just propaganda,
p228
aVhere's Priyanka, 23 years old.
p229
aVI met her last October in India,
p230
aVand she grew up in a conservative environment.
p231
aVShe grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,
p232
aVand she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,
p233
aVshe moved into her in-law's house.
p234
aVAnd she was horrified to get there and find
p235
aVthat they didn't have a toilet.
p236
aVShe'd grown up with a latrine.
p237
aVIt was no big deal, but it was a latrine.
p238
aVAnd the first night she was there, she was told
p239
aVthat at 4 o'clock in the morning \u2014
p240
aVher mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside
p241
aVand go and do it in the dark in the open.
p242
aVAnd she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
p243
aVShe was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.
p244
aVAfter three days, she did an unthinkable thing.
p245
aVShe left.
p246
aVAnd if you know anything about rural India,
p247
aVyou'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.
p248
aVBut not just that.
p249
aVShe got her toilet, and now she goes around
p250
aVall the other villages in India
p251
aVpersuading other women to do the same thing.
p252
aVIt's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful
p253
aVand really exciting.
p254
aa(lp255
VAnother version of this, another village in India
p256
aVnear where Priyanka lives
p257
aVis this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,
p258
aVit had no toilets whatsoever.
p259
aVKids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
p260
aVSome visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks
p261
aVlike putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit
p262
aVand watching the flies go one to the other.
p263
aVSomehow, people who'd been thinking
p264
aVthat what they were doing was not disgusting at all
p265
aVsuddenly thought, "Oops."
p266
aVNot only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.
p267
aVThat's what really made them change their behavior.
p268
aVSo this woman, this boy's mother
p269
aVinstalled this latrine in a few hours.
p270
aVHer entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,
p271
aVbut she installed the latrine in a few hours.
p272
aVIt cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,
p275
aVeven though these are pretty exciting times
p276
aVbecause we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
p277
aVreinventing the toilet, which is great,
p278
aVwe've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,
p279
aVwhich is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.
p280
aVBut there are things to worry about.
p281
aVIt's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.
p282
aVIt's about 50 or so years off track.
p283
aVWe're not going to meet targets,
p284
aVproviding people with sanitation at this rate.
p285
aVSo when I get sad about sanitation,
p286
aVI think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago
p287
aVwas a nation of people who used pit latrines
p288
aVand wiped with sticks,
p289
aVand now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,
p290
aVwashlet toilets.
p291
aVThey have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,
p292
aVhands-free cleaning experience,
p293
aVand they have various other features
p294
aVlike a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device
p295
aVwhich is known as the "marriage-saver."
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VBut most importantly, what they have done in Japan,
p299
aVwhich I find so inspirational,
p300
aVis they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.
p301
aVThey've made it conversational.
p302
aVPeople go out and upgrade their toilet.
p303
aVThey talk about it. They've sanitized it.
p304
aVI hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
p305
aVAll we really need to do
p306
aVis look at this issue
p307
aVas the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
p308
aVAnd don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.
p309
aVOur sewers are crumbling.
p310
aVThings are going wrong here too.
p311
aVThe solution to all of this is pretty easy.
p312
aVI'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon
p313
aVand just ask you to do one thing,
p314
aVand that's to go out, protest,
p315
aVspeak about the unspeakable,
p316
aVand talk shit.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.
p319
