VThis is called Hooked on a Feeling:
p4
aVThe Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.
p5
aVI put up a somewhat dour Darwin,
p6
aVbut a very happy chimp up there.
p7
aVMy first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.
p8
aVMan wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,
p9
aVand cannot wish not to be so.
p10
aVWe are wired to pursue happiness,
p11
aVnot only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo given that that's true,
p14
aVhow good are we at increasing our happiness?
p15
aVWell, we certainly try.
p16
aVIf you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles
p17
aVwith advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,
p18
aVthe 10 secrets,
p19
aVthe 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.
p20
aVNow another way we try to increase our happiness
p21
aVis we medicate ourselves.
p22
aVAnd so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.
p23
aVProzac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.
p24
aVIt was clean, efficient, there was no high,
p25
aVthere was really no danger, it had no street value.
p26
aVIn 1995,
p27
aVillegal drugs were a $400 billion business,
p28
aVrepresenting eight percent of world trade,
p29
aVroughly the same as gas and oil.
p30
aa(lp31
VThese routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.
p32
aVOne problem that's happening now is,
p33
aValthough the rates of happiness
p34
aVare about as flat as the surface of the moon,
p35
aVdepression and anxiety are rising.
p36
aVSome people say this is because we have better diagnosis,
p37
aVand more people are being found out.
p38
aVIt isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.
p39
aVIn the United States right now
p40
aVthere are more suicides than homicides.
p41
aVThere is a rash of suicide in China.
p42
aVAnd the World Health Organization predicts
p43
aVby the year 2020
p44
aVthat depression will be
p45
aVthe second largest cause of disability.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow the good news here
p48
aVis that if you take surveys from around the world,
p49
aVwe see that about three quarters of people
p50
aVwill say they are at least pretty happy.
p51
aVBut this does not follow any of the usual trends.
p52
aVFor example, these two show great growth in income,
p53
aVabsolutely flat happiness curves.
p54
aa(lp55
VMy field, the field of psychology,
p56
aVhasn't done a whole lot
p57
aVto help us move forward in understanding human happiness.
p58
aVIn part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,
p59
aVwho said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,
p60
aVis propelled by infantile aspects of the individual
p61
aVthat can never be met in reality.
p62
aVHe said, "One feels inclined to say
p63
aVthat the intention that man should be happy
p64
aVis not included in the plan of creation."
p65
aVSo the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy
p66
aVwas really what Freud called ordinary misery.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd Freud in part reflects
p71
aVthe anatomy of the human emotion system \u2014
p72
aVwhich is that we have both a positive and a negative system,
p73
aVand our negative system
p74
aVis extremely sensitive.
p75
aVSo for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet
p76
aVand reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.
p77
aVWe also find that people are more averse to losing
p78
aVthan they are happy to gain.
p79
aVThe formula for a happy marriage
p80
aVis five positive remarks, or interactions,
p81
aVfor every one negative.
p82
aVAnd that's how powerful the one negative is.
p83
aVEspecially expressions of contempt or disgust,
p84
aVwell you really need a lot of positives to upset that.
p85
aa(lp86
VI also put in here the stress response.
p87
aVWe're wired for dangers that are immediate,
p88
aVthat are physical, that are imminent,
p89
aVand so our body goes into an incredible reaction
p90
aVwhere endogenous opioids come in.
p91
aVWe have a system that is really ancient,
p92
aVand really there for physical danger.
p93
aVAnd so over time, this becomes a stress response,
p94
aVwhich has enormous effects on the body.
p95
aVCortisol floods the brain;
p96
aVit destroys hippocampal cells and memory,
p97
aVand can lead to all kinds of health problems.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut unfortunately, we need this system in part.
p100
aVIf we were only governed by pleasure
p101
aVwe would not survive.
p102
aVWe really have two command posts.
p103
aVEmotions are short-lived intense responses
p104
aVto challenge and to opportunity.
p105
aVAnd each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves
p106
aVthat tune in, turn on, drop out
p107
aVthoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.
p108
aVWe tend to think of emotions as just feelings.
p109
aVBut in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert
p110
aVthat change what we remember,
p111
aVwhat kind of decisions we make,
p112
aVand how we perceive things.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo let me go forward to the new science of happiness.
p115
aVWe've come away from the Freudian gloom,
p116
aVand people are now actively studying this.
p117
aVAnd one of the key points in the science of happiness
p118
aVis that happiness and unhappiness
p119
aVare not endpoints of a single continuum.
p120
aVThe Freudian model is really one continuum
p121
aVthat, as you get less miserable,
p122
aVyou get happier.
p123
aVAnd that isn't true \u2014 when you get less miserable,
p124
aVyou get less miserable.
p125
aVAnd that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
p126
aVAnd it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.
p127
aVSo when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,
p128
aVbecause there isn't a sense of the other half \u2014
p129
aVof what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,
p130
aVwhat are the positive emotions.
p131
aVAnd of course we know this intuitively,
p132
aVthat happiness is not just the absence of misery.
p133
aVBut somehow it was not put forward until very recently,
p134
aVseeing these as two parallel systems.
p135
aVSo that the body can both look for opportunity
p136
aVand also protect itself from danger, at the same time.
p137
aVAnd they're sort of two reciprocal
p138
aVand dynamically interacting systems.
p139
aa(lp140
VPeople have also wanted to deconstruct.
p141
aVWe use this word "happy,"
p142
aVand it's this very large umbrella of a term.
p143
aVAnd then three emotions for which there are no English words:
p144
aVfiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;
p145
aVschadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,
p146
aVa malicious pleasure;
p147
aVand naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.
p148
aVAbsent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,
p149
aVare happiness in another's happiness.
p150
aVWe don't seem to have a word for that.
p151
aVWe are very sensitive to the negative,
p152
aVbut it is in part offset by the fact
p153
aVthat we have a positivity.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe're also born pleasure-seekers.
p156
aVBabies love the taste of sweet
p157
aVand hate the taste of bitter.
p158
aVThey love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.
p159
aVThey like to look at beautiful faces
p160
aVrather than plain faces.
p161
aVThey like to listen to consonant melodies
p162
aVinstead of dissonant melodies.
p163
aVBabies really are born
p164
aVwith a lot of innate pleasures.
p165
aVThere was once a statement made by a psychologist
p166
aVthat said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness
p167
aVis really just about the genes,
p168
aVand it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.
p169
aVThat's nonsense.
p170
aVThere is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes \u2014
p171
aVabout 50 percent \u2014
p172
aVbut there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.
p173
aa(lp174
VLet's just go into the brain for a moment,
p175
aVand see where does happiness
p176
aVarise from in evolution.
p177
aVWe have basically at least two systems here,
p178
aVand they both are very ancient.
p179
aVOne is the reward system,
p180
aVand that's fed by the chemical dopamine.
p181
aVAnd it starts in the ventral tegmental area.
p182
aVIt goes to the nucleus accumbens,
p183
aVall the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,
p184
aVwhere decisions are made, high level.
p185
aVThis was originally seen as a system
p186
aVthat was the pleasure system of the brain.
p187
aVIn the 1950s,
p188
aVOlds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.
p189
aVAnd the rat would just keep pressing that bar
p190
aVthousands and thousands and thousands of times.
p191
aVIt wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
p192
aVIt wouldn't do anything but press this bar.
p193
aVSo they assumed
p194
aVthis must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.
p195
aa(lp196
VIt turned out that it wasn't,
p197
aVthat it really is a system of motivation,
p198
aVa system of wanting.
p199
aVIt gives objects what's called incentive salience.
p200
aVIt makes something look so attractive
p201
aVthat you just have to go after it.
p202
aVThat's something different
p203
aVfrom the system that is the pleasure system,
p204
aVwhich simply says, "I like this."
p205
aVThe pleasure system, as you see,
p206
aVwhich is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,
p207
aVis widely spread throughout the brain.
p208
aVDopamine system, the wanting system,
p209
aVis much more centralized.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.
p212
aVAnd we see here the smile.
p213
aVAnd the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips
p214
aVto the zygomatic major.
p215
aVIt's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,
p216
aVthe orbicularis oculi.
p217
aVSo you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,
p218
aVwill show this particular kind of smile.
p219
aVExtroverts use it more than introverts.
p220
aVPeople who are relieved of depression
p221
aVshow it more after than before.
p222
aVSo if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,
p223
aVyou will look for this expression.
p224
aa(lp225
VOur pleasures are really ancient.
p226
aVAnd we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,
p227
aVbut many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia \u2014
p228
aVthat we have a response to the natural world
p229
aVthat's very profound.
p230
aVVery interesting studies
p231
aVdone on people recovering from surgery,
p232
aVwho found that people who faced a brick wall
p233
aVversus people who looked out on trees and nature,
p234
aVthe people who looked out on the brick wall
p235
aVwere in the hospital longer, needed more medication,
p236
aVand had more medical complications.
p237
aVThere is something very restorative about nature,
p238
aVand it's part of how we are tuned.
p239
aa(lp240
VHumans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.
p241
aVAnd we imitate from almost the second we are born.
p242
aVHere is a three-week-old baby.
p243
aVAnd if you stick your tongue out at this baby,
p244
aVthe baby will do the same.
p245
aVWe are social beings from the beginning.
p246
aVAnd even studies of cooperation
p247
aVshow that cooperation between individuals
p248
aVlights up reward centers of the brain.
p249
aVOne problem that psychology has had
p250
aVis instead of looking at this intersubjectivity \u2014
p251
aVor the importance of the social brain
p252
aVto humans who come into the world helpless
p253
aVand need each other tremendously \u2014
p254
aVis that they focus instead on the self
p255
aVand self-esteem, and not self-other.
p256
aVIt's sort of "me," not "we."
p257
aVAnd I think this has been a really tremendous problem
p258
aVthat goes against our biology and nature,
p259
aVand hasn't made us any happier at all.
p260
aa(lp261
VBecause when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,
p262
aVwhen they're absorbed in something out in the world,
p263
aVwhen they're with other people, when they're active,
p264
aVengaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,
p265
aVlearning, having sex, whatever.
p266
aVThey're not sitting in front of the mirror
p267
aVtrying to figure themselves out,
p268
aVor thinking about themselves.
p269
aVThese are not the periods when you feel happiest.
p270
aVThe other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,
p271
aVis if you look at computerized text analysis
p272
aVof people who commit suicide,
p273
aVwhat you find there, and it's quite interesting,
p274
aVis use of the first person singular \u2014
p275
aV"I," "me," "my,"
p276
aVnot "we" and "us" \u2014
p277
aVand the letters are less hopeless
p278
aVthan they are really alone.
p279
aVAnd being alone is very unnatural to the human.
p280
aVThere is a profound need to belong.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.
p283
aVBecause, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,
p284
aVthey care that we replicate,
p285
aVthat we pass our genes on.
p286
aVSo for example we have three systems
p287
aVthat underlie reproduction, because it's so important.
p288
aVThere's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.
p289
aVAnd that's really mediated by the sex hormones.
p290
aVRomantic attraction,
p291
aVthat gets into the desire system.
p292
aVAnd that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."
p293
aVThere's attachment, which is oxytocin,
p294
aVand the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."
p295
aVSee the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.
p296
aVSo a person can be in a long term attachment,
p297
aVbecome romantically infatuated with someone else,
p298
aVand want to have sex with a third person.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray
p301
aVis in social status.
p302
aVWe are very acutely aware of our social status
p303
aVand always seek to further and increase it.
p304
aVNow in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,
p305
aVand that's dominance.
p306
aVI seize command by physical prowess,
p307
aVand I keep it by beating my chest,
p308
aVand you make submissive gestures.
p309
aVNow, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,
p310
aVand that is a prestige route,
p311
aVwhich is freely conferred.
p312
aVSomeone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,
p313
aVand we give that person status.
p314
aVAnd that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status
p315
aVso that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy
p316
aVas they are in the animal world.
p317
aa(lp318
VThe data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.
p319
aVBut it's not irrelevant.
p320
aVSo if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,
p321
aVyou see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.
p322
aVYou see mental distress going up with lower income.
p323
aVSo clearly there is some effect.
p324
aVBut the effect is relatively small.
p325
aVAnd one of the problems with money is materialism.
p326
aVWhat happens when people pursue money too avidly,
p327
aVis they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.
p328
aVSo we have here, this couple.
p329
aV"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"
p330
aVAnd then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."
p331
aVSo one of the things is that it really takes over.
p332
aVThat whole dopamine-wanting system
p333
aVtakes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.
p334
aa(lp335
VMaslow had this idea back in the 1950s
p336
aVthat as people rise above their biological needs,
p337
aVas the world becomes safer
p338
aVand we don't have to worry about basic needs being met \u2014
p339
aVour biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied \u2014
p340
aVwe can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves
p341
aVtoward self-actualization or transcendence,
p342
aVand rise above the materialist.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo to just quickly conclude with some brief data
p345
aVthat suggests this might be so.
p346
aVOne is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:
p347
aVthey felt their life and their whole values had changed.
p348
aVAnd sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,
p349
aVyou see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,
p350
aVbefore the change,
p351
aVand much more post-materialist values after.
p352
aVWomen had a whole different set of value shifts.
p353
aVBut very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.
p354
aVThey went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control
p355
aVto generosity and forgiveness.
p356
aa(lp357
VI end with a few quotes.
p358
aV"There is only one question:
p359
aVHow to love this world?"
p360
aVAnd Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,
p361
aVdo not blame it; blame yourself.
p362
aVTell yourself that you are not poet enough
p363
aVto call forth its riches."
p364
aV"First, say to yourself what you would be.
p365
aVThen do what you have to do."
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.
