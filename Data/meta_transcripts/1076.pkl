VI've been spending a lot of time
p4
aVtraveling around the world these days,
p5
aVtalking to groups of students and professionals,
p6
aVand everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.
p7
aVOn the one hand, people say,
p8
aV"The time for change is now."
p9
aVThey want to be part of it.
p10
aVThey talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
p11
aVBut on the other hand,
p12
aVI hear people talking about fear,
p13
aVa sense of risk-aversion.
p14
aVThey say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,
p15
aVbut I don't know where to start.
p16
aVI don't want to disappoint my family or friends."
p17
aVI work in global poverty.
p18
aVAnd they say, "I want to work in global poverty,
p19
aVbut what will it mean about my career?
p20
aVWill I be marginalized?
p21
aVWill I not make enough money?
p22
aVWill I never get married or have children?"
p23
aVAnd as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older \u2014
p24
aVand I'm glad I waited \u2014
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aV\u2014 and has no children,
p27
aVI look at these young people
p28
aVand I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.
p29
aVYour job is only to be human.
p30
aVAnd nothing important happens in life
p31
aVwithout a cost."
p32
aVThese conversations really reflect what's happening
p33
aVat the national and international level.
p34
aVOur leaders and ourselves
p35
aVwant everything,
p36
aVbut we don't talk about the costs.
p37
aVWe don't talk about the sacrifice.
p38
aa(lp39
VOne of my favorite quotes from literature
p40
aVwas written by Tillie Olsen,
p41
aVthe great American writer from the South.
p42
aVIn a short story called "Oh Yes,"
p43
aVshe talks about a white woman in the 1950s
p44
aVwho has a daughter
p45
aVwho befriends a little African American girl,
p46
aVand she looks at her child with a sense of pride,
p47
aVbut she also wonders,
p48
aVwhat price will she pay?
p49
aV"Better immersion
p50
aVthan to live untouched."
p51
aVBut the real question is,
p52
aVwhat is the cost of not daring?
p53
aVWhat is the cost of not trying?
p54
aa(lp55
VI've been so privileged in my life
p56
aVto know extraordinary leaders
p57
aVwho have chosen to live lives of immersion.
p58
aVOne woman I knew who was a fellow
p59
aVat a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation
p60
aVwas named Ingrid Washinawatok.
p61
aVShe was a leader of the Menominee tribe,
p62
aVa Native American peoples.
p63
aVAnd when we would gather as fellows,
p64
aVshe would push us to think about
p65
aVhow the elders in Native American culture
p66
aVmake decisions.
p67
aVAnd she said they would literally visualize
p68
aVthe faces of children
p69
aVfor seven generations into the future,
p70
aVlooking at them from the Earth,
p71
aVand they would look at them, holding them as stewards
p72
aVfor that future.
p73
aVIngrid understood that we are connected to each other,
p74
aVnot only as human beings,
p75
aVbut to every living thing on the planet.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd tragically, in 1999,
p78
aVwhen she was in Colombia
p79
aVworking with the U'wa people,
p80
aVfocused on preserving their culture and language,
p81
aVshe and two colleagues were abducted
p82
aVand tortured and killed by the FARC.
p83
aVAnd whenever we would gather the fellows after that,
p84
aVwe would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
p85
aVAnd more than a decade later,
p86
aVwhen I talk to NGO fellows,
p87
aVwhether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,
p88
aVand we talk about Ingrid,
p89
aVthey all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom
p90
aVand her spirit
p91
aVand really build on the unfulfilled work
p92
aVof her life's mission.
p93
aVAnd when we think about legacy,
p94
aVI can think of no more powerful one,
p95
aVdespite how short her life was.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd I've been touched by Cambodian women \u2014
p98
aVbeautiful women,
p99
aVwomen who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.
p100
aVAnd I met them in the early '90s.
p101
aVIn the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,
p102
aVthe Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,
p103
aVand they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,
p104
aVthe artists, the dancers.
p105
aVAnd at the end of the war,
p106
aVthere were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.
p107
aVAnd the women, who I was so privileged to meet
p108
aVwhen there were three survivors,
p109
aVtold these stories about lying in their cots
p110
aVin the refugee camps.
p111
aVThey said they would try so hard
p112
aVto remember the fragments of the dance,
p113
aVhoping that others were alive and doing the same.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,
p116
aVher hands at her side,
p117
aVand she talked about
p118
aVthe reunion of the 30 after the war
p119
aVand how extraordinary it was.
p120
aVAnd these big tears fell down her face,
p121
aVbut she never lifted her hands to move them.
p122
aVAnd the women decided that they would train
p123
aVnot the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,
p124
aVbut the next generation.
p125
aVAnd I sat there in the studio
p126
aVwatching these women clapping their hands \u2014
p127
aVbeautiful rhythms \u2014
p128
aVas these little fairy pixies
p129
aVwere dancing around them,
p130
aVwearing these beautiful silk colors.
p131
aVAnd I thought, after all this atrocity,
p132
aVthis is how human beings really pray.
p133
aVBecause they're focused on honoring
p134
aVwhat is most beautiful about our past
p135
aVand building it into
p136
aVthe promise of our future.
p137
aVAnd what these women understood
p138
aVis sometimes the most important things that we do
p139
aVand that we spend our time on
p140
aVare those things that we cannot measure.
p141
aa(lp142
VI also have been touched
p143
aVby the dark side of power and leadership.
p144
aVAnd I have learned that power,
p145
aVparticularly in its absolute form,
p146
aVis an equal opportunity provider.
p147
aVIn 1986, I moved to Rwanda,
p148
aVand I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women
p149
aVto start that country's first microfinance bank.
p150
aVAnd one of the women was Agnes \u2014
p151
aVthere on your extreme left \u2014
p152
aVshe was one of the first three
p153
aVwomen parliamentarians in Rwanda,
p154
aVand her legacy should have been
p155
aVto be one of the mothers of Rwanda.
p156
aVWe built this institution based on social justice,
p157
aVgender equity,
p158
aVthis idea of empowering women.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut Agnes cared more about the trappings of power
p161
aVthan she did principle at the end.
p162
aVAnd though she had been part of building a liberal party,
p163
aVa political party
p164
aVthat was focused on diversity and tolerance,
p165
aVabout three months before the genocide, she switched parties
p166
aVand joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,
p167
aVand she became the Minister of Justice
p168
aVunder the genocide regime
p169
aVand was known for inciting men to kill faster
p170
aVand stop behaving like women.
p171
aVShe was convicted
p172
aVof category one crimes of genocide.
p173
aVAnd I would visit her in the prisons,
p174
aVsitting side-by-side, knees touching,
p175
aVand I would have to admit to myself
p176
aVthat monsters exist in all of us,
p177
aVbut that maybe it's not monsters so much,
p178
aVbut the broken parts of ourselves,
p179
aVsadnesses, secret shame,
p180
aVand that ultimately it's easy for demagogues
p181
aVto prey on those parts,
p182
aVthose fragments, if you will,
p183
aVand to make us look at other beings, human beings,
p184
aVas lesser than ourselves \u2014
p185
aVand in the extreme, to do terrible things.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd there is no group
p188
aVmore vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations
p189
aVthan young men.
p190
aVI've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet
p191
aVis the adolescent male.
p192
aVAnd so in a gathering
p193
aVwhere we're focused on women,
p194
aVwhile it is so critical that we invest in our girls
p195
aVand we even the playing field
p196
aVand we find ways to honor them,
p197
aVwe have to remember that the girls and the women
p198
aVare most isolated and violated
p199
aVand victimized and made invisible
p200
aVin those very societies
p201
aVwhere our men and our boys
p202
aVfeel disempowered,
p203
aVunable to provide.
p204
aVAnd that, when they sit on those street corners
p205
aVand all they can think of in the future
p206
aVis no job, no education,
p207
aVno possibility,
p208
aVwell then it's easy to understand
p209
aVhow the greatest source of status
p210
aVcan come from a uniform
p211
aVand a gun.
p212
aa(lp213
VSometimes very small investments
p214
aVcan release enormous, infinite potential
p215
aVthat exists in all of us.
p216
aVOne of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,
p217
aVSuraj Sudhakar,
p218
aVhas what we call moral imagination \u2014
p219
aVthe ability to put yourself in another person's shoes
p220
aVand lead from that perspective.
p221
aVAnd he's been working with this young group of men
p222
aVwho come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.
p223
aVAnd they're incredible guys.
p224
aVAnd together they started a book club
p225
aVfor a hundred people in the slums,
p226
aVand they're reading many TED authors and liking it.
p227
aVAnd then they created a business plan competition.
p228
aVThen they decided that they would do TEDx's.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd I have learned so much
p231
aVfrom Chris and Kevin
p232
aVand Alex and Herbert
p233
aVand all of these young men.
p234
aVAlex, in some ways, said it best.
p235
aVHe said, "We used to feel like nobodies,
p236
aVbut now we feel like somebodies."
p237
aVAnd I think we have it all wrong
p238
aVwhen we think that income is the link.
p239
aVWhat we really yearn for as human beings
p240
aVis to be visible to each other.
p241
aVAnd the reason these young guys
p242
aVtold me that they're doing these TEDx's
p243
aVis because they were sick and tired
p244
aVof the only workshops coming to the slums
p245
aVbeing those workshops focused on HIV,
p246
aVor at best, microfinance.
p247
aVAnd they wanted to celebrate
p248
aVwhat's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare \u2014
p249
aVthe photojournalists and the creatives,
p250
aVthe graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.
p251
aVAnd they're doing it.
p252
aVAnd my hat's off to you in Kibera.
p253
aa(lp254
VMy own work focuses
p255
aVon making philanthropy more effective
p256
aVand capitalism more inclusive.
p257
aVAt Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources
p258
aVand we invest what we call patient capital \u2014
p259
aVmoney that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor
p260
aVnot as passive recipients of charity,
p261
aVbut as full-bodied agents of change
p262
aVwho want to solve their own problems
p263
aVand make their own decisions.
p264
aVWe leave our money for 10 to 15 years,
p265
aVand when we get it back, we invest in other innovations
p266
aVthat focus on change.
p267
aVI know it works.
p268
aVWe've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,
p269
aVand those companies have brought another 200 million dollars
p270
aVinto these forgotten markets.
p271
aVThis year alone, they've delivered 40 million services
p272
aVlike maternal health care and housing,
p273
aVemergency services, solar energy,
p274
aVso that people can have more dignity
p275
aVin solving their problems.
p276
aa(lp277
VPatient capital is uncomfortable
p278
aVfor people searching for simple solutions,
p279
aVeasy categories,
p280
aVbecause we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.
p281
aVBut we find those entrepreneurs
p282
aVwho put people and the planet
p283
aVbefore profit.
p284
aVAnd ultimately, we want to be part of a movement
p285
aVthat is about measuring impact,
p286
aVmeasuring what is most important to us.
p287
aVAnd my dream is we'll have a world one day
p288
aVwhere we don't just honor those who take money
p289
aVand make more money from it,
p290
aVbut we find those individuals who take our resources
p291
aVand convert it into changing the world
p292
aVin the most positive ways.
p293
aVAnd it's only when we honor them
p294
aVand celebrate them and give them status
p295
aVthat the world will really change.
p296
aa(lp297
VLast May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period
p298
aVwhere I saw two visions of the world
p299
aVliving side-by-side \u2014
p300
aVone based on violence
p301
aVand the other on transcendence.
p302
aVI happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan
p303
aVon the day that two mosques were attacked
p304
aVby suicide bombers.
p305
aVAnd the reason these mosques were attacked
p306
aVis because the people praying inside
p307
aVwere from a particular sect of Islam
p308
aVwho fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.
p309
aVAnd not only did those suicide bombers
p310
aVtake a hundred lives,
p311
aVbut they did more,
p312
aVbecause they created more hatred, more rage, more fear
p313
aVand certainly despair.
p314
aa(lp315
VBut less than 24 hours,
p316
aVI was 13 miles away from those mosques,
p317
aVvisiting one of our Acumen investees,
p318
aVan incredible man, Jawad Aslam,
p319
aVwho dares to live a life of immersion.
p320
aVBorn and raised in Baltimore,
p321
aVhe studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,
p322
aVand after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.
p323
aVFor two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,
p324
aVbut he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer
p325
aVnamed Tasneem Saddiqui.
p326
aVAnd he had a dream that he would build a housing community
p327
aVon this barren piece of land
p328
aVusing patient capital,
p329
aVbut he continued to pay a price.
p330
aVHe stood on moral ground
p331
aVand refused to pay bribes.
p332
aVIt took almost two years just to register the land.
p333
aVBut I saw how the level of moral standard can rise
p334
aVfrom one person's action.
p335
aa(lp336
VToday, 2,000 people live in 300 houses
p337
aVin this beautiful community.
p338
aVAnd there's schools and clinics and shops.
p339
aVBut there's only one mosque.
p340
aVAnd so I asked Jawad,
p341
aV"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.
p342
aVWho gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"
p343
aVHe said, "Long story.
p344
aVIt was hard, it was a difficult road,
p345
aVbut ultimately the leaders of the community came together,
p346
aVrealizing we only have each other.
p347
aVAnd we decided that we would elect
p348
aVthe three most respected imams,
p349
aVand those imams would take turns,
p350
aVthey would rotate who would say Friday prayer.
p351
aVBut the whole community,
p352
aVall the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,
p353
aVwould sit together and pray."
p354
aa(lp355
VWe need that kind of moral leadership and courage
p356
aVin our worlds.
p357
aVWe face huge issues as a world \u2014
p358
aVthe financial crisis,
p359
aVglobal warming
p360
aVand this growing sense of fear and otherness.
p361
aVAnd every day we have a choice.
p362
aVWe can take the easier road,
p363
aVthe more cynical road,
p364
aVwhich is a road based on
p365
aVsometimes dreams of a past that never really was,
p366
aVa fear of each other,
p367
aVdistancing and blame.
p368
aVOr we can take the much more difficult path
p369
aVof transformation, transcendence,
p370
aVcompassion and love,
p371
aVbut also accountability and justice.
p372
aa(lp373
VI had the great honor
p374
aVof working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,
p375
aVwho stood up for change
p376
aVduring the Civil Rights movement in the United States.
p377
aVAnd he tells this incredible story
p378
aVabout working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,
p379
aVthe first child to desegregate schools in the South \u2014
p380
aVin this case, New Orleans.
p381
aVAnd he said that every day
p382
aVthis six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,
p383
aVwould walk with real grace
p384
aVthrough a phalanx of white people
p385
aVscreaming angrily, calling her a monster,
p386
aVthreatening to poison her \u2014
p387
aVdistorted faces.
p388
aVAnd every day he would watch her,
p389
aVand it looked like she was talking to the people.
p390
aVAnd he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"
p391
aVAnd she'd say, "I'm not talking."
p392
aVAnd finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.
p393
aVWhat are you saying?"
p394
aVAnd she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;
p395
aVI'm praying."
p396
aVAnd he said, "Well, what are you praying?"
p397
aVAnd she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,
p398
aVfor they know not what they are doing.'"
p399
aVAt age six,
p400
aVthis child was living a life of immersion,
p401
aVand her family paid a price for it.
p402
aVBut she became part of history
p403
aVand opened up this idea
p404
aVthat all of us should have access to education.
p405
aa(lp406
VMy final story is about a young, beautiful man
p407
aVnamed Josephat Byaruhanga,
p408
aVwho was another Acumen Fund fellow,
p409
aVwho hails from Uganda, a farming community.
p410
aVAnd we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,
p411
aVjust 200 miles away.
p412
aVAnd he said to me at the end of his year,
p413
aV"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,
p414
aVbecause I thought as a farmer and as an African
p415
aVI would understand how to transcend culture.
p416
aVBut especially when I was talking to the African women,
p417
aVI sometimes made these mistakes \u2014
p418
aVit was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
p419
aVAnd he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,
p420
aVleadership is like a panicle of rice.
p421
aVBecause at the height of the season,
p422
aVat the height of its powers,
p423
aVit's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,
p424
aVit reaches to the heavens."
p425
aVAnd he said, "But right before the harvest,
p426
aVit bends over
p427
aVwith great gratitude and humility
p428
aVto touch the earth from where it came."
p429
aa(lp430
VWe need leaders.
p431
aVWe ourselves need to lead
p432
aVfrom a place that has the audacity
p433
aVto believe we can, ourselves,
p434
aVextend the fundamental assumption
p435
aVthat all men are created equal
p436
aVto every man, woman and child on this planet.
p437
aVAnd we need to have the humility to recognize
p438
aVthat we cannot do it alone.
p439
aVRobert Kennedy once said
p440
aVthat "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,
p441
aVbut each of us can work
p442
aVto change a small portion of events."
p443
aVAnd it is in the total of all those acts
p444
aVthat the history of this generation will be written.
p445
aVOur lives are so short,
p446
aVand our time on this planet
p447
aVis so precious,
p448
aVand all we have is each other.
p449
aVSo may each of you
p450
aVlive lives of immersion.
p451
aVThey won't necessarily be easy lives,
p452
aVbut in the end, it is all that will sustain us.
p453
