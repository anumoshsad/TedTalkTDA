VIn the year 1901,
p4
aVa woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
p5
aVAuguste was delusional
p6
aVand couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
p7
aVHer doctor was called Alois.
p8
aVAlois didn't know how to help Auguste,
p9
aVbut he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906.
p10
aVAfter she died, Alois performed an autopsy
p11
aVand found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain \u2014
p12
aVthe likes of which he'd never seen before.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow here's the even more striking thing.
p15
aVIf Auguste had instead been alive today,
p16
aVwe could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
p17
aVAlois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
p18
aVAnd Auguste Deter
p19
aVwas the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
p20
aVSince 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
p21
aVWe've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections,
p22
aVmany treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV,
p23
aVstatins for heart disease and much more.
p24
aVBut we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
p25
aa(lp26
VI'm part of a team of scientists
p27
aVwho has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
p28
aVSo I think about this all the time.
p29
aVAlzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
p30
aVBut by 2050, it will affect 150 million people \u2014
p31
aVwhich, by the way, will include many of you.
p32
aVIf you're hoping to live to be 85 or older,
p33
aVyour chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
p34
aVIn other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years
p35
aVeither suffering from Alzheimer's
p36
aVor helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's.
p37
aVAlready in the United States alone,
p38
aVAlzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
p39
aVOne out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
p40
aVIt is today the most expensive disease,
p41
aVand costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050,
p42
aVas the baby boomer generation ages.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt may surprise you that, put simply,
p45
aVAlzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
p46
aVBut we've done relatively little to address it.
p47
aVToday, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide,
p48
aVAlzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
p49
aVWe understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases
p50
aVbecause we've invested less time and money into researching it.
p51
aVThe US government spends 10 times more every year
p52
aVon cancer research than on Alzheimer's
p53
aVdespite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more
p54
aVand causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause:
p57
aVa lack of awareness.
p58
aVBecause here's what few people know but everyone should:
p59
aVAlzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
p60
aVFor most of the past 114 years,
p61
aVeveryone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.
p62
aVWe thought that becoming senile
p63
aVwas a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
p64
aVBut we only have to look at a picture
p65
aVof a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient
p66
aVto see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
p67
aVAs well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities,
p68
aVthe damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's
p69
aVsignificantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.
p70
aa(lp71
VRemember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles
p72
aVin Auguste's brain a century ago.
p73
aVFor almost a century, we didn't know much about these.
p74
aVToday we know they're made from protein molecules.
p75
aVYou can imagine a protein molecule
p76
aVas a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
p77
aVThere are spots on the paper that are sticky.
p78
aVAnd when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
p79
aVBut sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
p80
aVThis causes the protein molecules to stick to each other,
p81
aVforming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.
p82
aVThat's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge
p85
aVtrying to understand how this malfunction works.
p86
aVThere are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex \u2014
p87
aVlike defusing a bomb.
p88
aVCutting one wire might do nothing.
p89
aVCutting others might make the bomb explore.
p90
aVWe have to find the right step to block,
p91
aVand then create a drug that does it.
p92
aa(lp93
VUntil recently, we for the most part
p94
aVhave been cutting wires and hoping for the best.
p95
aVBut now we've got together a diverse group of people \u2014
p96
aVmedics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
p97
aVAnd together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process
p98
aVand are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step
p99
aVand stop the disease.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow let me show you some of our latest results.
p102
aVNo one outside of our lab has seen these yet.
p103
aVLet's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms.
p104
aVSo these are healthy worms,
p105
aVand you can see they're moving around normally.
p106
aVThese worms, on the other hand,
p107
aVhave protein molecules sticking together inside them \u2014
p108
aVlike humans with Alzheimer's.
p109
aVAnd you can see they're clearly sick.
p110
aVBut if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage,
p111
aVthen we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan.
p112
aVThis is just an initial positive result, but research like this
p113
aVshows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.
p114
aa(lp115
VAfter 114 years of waiting,
p116
aVthere's finally real hope for what can be achieved
p117
aVin the next 10 or 20 years.
p118
aVBut to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
p119
aVThis isn't about scientists like me \u2014
p120
aVit's about you.
p121
aVWe need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease
p122
aVand that if we try, we can beat it.
p123
aVIn the case of other diseases,
p124
aVpatients and their families have led the charge for more research
p125
aVand put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry,
p126
aVscientists and regulators.
p127
aVThat was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s.
p128
aVToday, we see that same drive to beat cancer.
p129
aVBut Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.
p130
aVAnd their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day,
p131
aVare often too worn out to go out and advocate for change.
p132
aVSo, it really is down to you.
p133
aVAlzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease.
p134
aVEveryone with a brain is at risk.
p135
aVToday, there are 40 million patients like Auguste,
p136
aVwho can't create the change they need for themselves.
p137
aVHelp speak up for them,
p138
aVand help demand a cure.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.
