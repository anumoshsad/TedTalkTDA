p32
aa(lp33
VWK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,
p34
aVand I read a book that would \u2014 "Using Energy,"
p35
aVand I get information about doing the mill.

aVAnd I tried, and I made it.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Applause)
p39
aa(lp40

aa(lp42

p43
aa(lp44
VCA: What happened?
p45
aa(lp46
VWK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,
p47
aVit has got four \u2014 ah \u2014 three blades,
p48
aVand mine has got four blades.
p49
aa(lp50
VCA: The book had three, yours had four.
p51
aa(lp52
VWK: Yeah.
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: And you made it out of what?

aa(lp56

p57
aa(lp58
VCA: OK.
p59
aa(lp60
VWK: Yeah.
p61
aa(lp62
VCA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?
p63
aa(lp64
VWK: Yeah. I test.
p65
aa(lp66
VCA: And what did you make the windmill out of?
p67
aVWhat materials did you use?
p68
aa(lp69
VWK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls \u2014
p70

VCA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?
p72
aa(lp73

p74
aa(lp75
