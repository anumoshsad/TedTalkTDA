VIn my early days as a graduate student,
p4
aVI went on a snorkeling trip off the coast of the Bahamas.
p5
aVI'd actually never swum in the ocean before,
p6
aVso it was a bit terrifying.
p7
aVWhat I remember the most is, as I put my head in the water
p8
aVand I was trying really hard to breathe through the snorkel,
p9
aVthis huge group of striped yellow and black fish
p10
aVcame straight at me ...
p11
aVand I just froze.
p12
aVAnd then, as if it had suddenly changed its mind,
p13
aVcame towards me and then swerved to the right
p14
aVand went right around me.
p15
aVIt was absolutely mesmerizing.
p16
aVMaybe many of you have had this experience.
p17
aVOf course, there's the color and the beauty of it,
p18
aVbut there was also just the sheer oneness of it,
p19
aVas if it wasn't hundreds of fish
p20
aVbut a single entity with a single collective mind
p21
aVthat was making decisions.
p22
aVWhen I look back, I think that experience really ended up determining
p23
aVwhat I've worked on for most of my career.
p24
aa(lp25
VI'm a computer scientist,
p26
aVand the field that I work in is artificial intelligence.
p27
aVAnd a key theme in AI
p28
aVis being able to understand intelligence by creating our own computational systems
p29
aVthat display intelligence the way we see it in nature.
p30
aVNow, most popular views of AI, of course, come from science fiction and the movies,
p31
aVand I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.
p32
aVBut that tends to be a very human-centric view of intelligence.
p33
aVWhen you think of a fish school,
p34
aVor when I think of a flock of starlings,
p35
aVthat feels like a really different kind of intelligence.
p36
aVFor starters, any one fish is just so tiny
p37
aVcompared to the sheer size of the collective,
p38
aVso it seems that any one individual
p39
aVwould have a really limited and myopic view of what's going on,
p40
aVand intelligence isn't really about the individual
p41
aVbut somehow a property of the group itself.
p42
aa(lp43
VSecondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable,
p44
aVis that we know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school.
p45
aVInstead, this incredible collective mind behavior
p46
aVis emerging purely from the interactions of one fish and another.
p47
aVSomehow, there are these interactions or rules of engagement
p48
aVbetween neighboring fish
p49
aVthat make it all work out.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo the question for AI then becomes,
p52
aVwhat are those rules of engagement that lead to this kind of intelligence,
p53
aVand of course, can we create our own?
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd that's the primary thing that I work on with my team in my lab.
p56
aVWe work on it through theory,
p57
aVlooking at abstract rule systems
p58
aVand thinking about the mathematics behind it.
p59
aVWe also do it through biology, working closely with experimentalists.
p60
aVBut mostly, we do it through robotics,
p61
aVwhere we try to create our own collective systems
p62
aVthat can do the kinds of things that we see in nature,
p63
aVor at least try to.
p64
aa(lp65
VOne of our first robotic quests along this line
p66
aVwas to create our very own colony of a thousand robots.
p67
aVSo very simple robots,
p68
aVbut they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence,
p69
aVand that's what we were able to do.
p70
aVSo this is what a single robot looks like.
p71
aVIt's quite small, about the size of a quarter,
p72
aVand you can program how it moves,
p73
aVbut it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots,
p74
aVand it can measure distances from them.
p75
aVAnd so now we can start to program exactly an interaction,
p76
aVa rule of engagement between neighbors.
p77
aVAnd once we have this system,
p78
aVwe can start to program many different kinds of rules of engagement
p79
aVthat you would see in nature.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo for example, spontaneous synchronization,
p82
aVhow audiences are clapping and suddenly start all clapping together,
p83
aVthe fireflies flashing together.
p84
aVWe can program rules for pattern formation,
p85
aVhow cells in a tissue
p86
aVdetermine what role they're going to take on
p87
aVand set the patterns of our bodies.
p88
aVWe can program rules for migration,
p89
aVand in this way, we're really learning from nature's rules.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut we can also take it a step further.
p92
aVWe can actually take these rules that we've learned from nature
p93
aVand combine them and create entirely new collective behaviors
p94
aVof our very own.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo for example,
p97
aVimagine that you had two different kinds of rules.
p98
aVSo your first rule is a motion rule
p99
aVwhere a moving robot can move around other stationary robots.
p100
aVAnd your second rule is a pattern rule
p101
aVwhere a robot takes on a color based on its two nearest neighbors.
p102
aVSo if I start with a blob of robots in a little pattern seed,
p103
aVit turns out that these two rules are sufficient for the group
p104
aVto be able to self-assemble a simple line pattern.
p105
aVAnd if I have more complicated pattern rules,
p106
aVand I design error correction rules,
p107
aVwe can actually create really, really complicated self assemblies,
p108
aVand here's what that looks like.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo here, you're going to see a thousand robots
p111
aVthat are working together to self-assemble the letter K.
p112
aVThe K is on its side.
p113
aVAnd the important thing is that no one is in charge.
p114
aVSo any single robot is only talking to a small number of robots nearby it,
p115
aVand it's using its motion rule to move around the half-built structure
p116
aVjust looking for a place to fit in based on its pattern rules.
p117
aVAnd even though no robot is doing anything perfectly,
p118
aVthe rules are such that we can get the collective to do its goal
p119
aVrobustly together.
p120
aVAnd the illusion becomes almost so perfect, you know \u2014
p121
aVyou just start to not even notice that they're individual robots at all,
p122
aVand it becomes a single entity,
p123
aVkind of like the school of fish.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo these are robots and rules in two dimensions,
p126
aVbut we can also think about robots and rules in three dimensions.
p127
aVSo what if we could create robots that could build together?
p128
aVAnd here, we can take inspiration from social insects.
p129
aVSo if you think about mound-building termites
p130
aVor you think about army ants,
p131
aVthey create incredible, complex nest structures out of mud
p132
aVand even out of their own bodies.
p133
aVAnd like the system I showed you before,
p134
aVthese insects actually also have pattern rules
p135
aVthat help them determine what to build,
p136
aVbut the pattern can be made out of other insects,
p137
aVor it could be made out of mud.
p138
aVAnd we can use that same idea to create rules for robots.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo here, you're going to see some simulated robots.
p141
aVSo the simulated robot has a motion rule,
p142
aVwhich is how it traverses through the structure,
p143
aVlooking for a place to fit in,
p144
aVand it has pattern rules where it looks at groups of blocks
p145
aVto decide whether to place a block.
p146
aVAnd with the right motion rules and the right pattern rules,
p147
aVwe can actually get the robots to build whatever we want.
p148
aVAnd of course, everybody wants their own tower.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo once we have these rules,
p153
aVwe can start to create the robot bodies that go with these rules.
p154
aVSo here, you see a robot that can climb over blocks,
p155
aVbut it can also lift and move these blocks
p156
aVand it can start to edit the very structure that it's on.
p157
aVBut with these rules,
p158
aVthis is really only one kind of robot body that you could imagine.
p159
aVYou could imagine many different kinds of robot bodies.
p160
aVSo if you think about robots that maybe could move sandbags
p161
aVand could help build levees,
p162
aVor we could think of robots that built out of soft materials
p163
aVand worked together to shore up a collapsed building \u2014
p164
aVso just the same kind of rules in different kinds of bodies.
p165
aVOr if, like my group, you are completely obsessed with army ants,
p166
aVthen maybe one day we can make robots that can climb over literally anything
p167
aVincluding other members of their tribe,
p168
aVand self-assemble things out of their own bodies.
p169
aVOnce you understand the rules,
p170
aVjust many different kinds of robot visions become possible.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd coming back to the snorkeling trip,
p173
aVwe actually understand a great deal about the rules that fish schools use.
p174
aVSo if we can invent the bodies to go with that,
p175
aVthen maybe there is a future
p176
aVwhere I and my group will get to snorkel with a fish school of our own creation.
p177
aa(lp178
VEach of these systems that I showed you
p179
aVbrings us closer to having the mathematical and the conceptual tools
p180
aVto create our own versions of collective power,
p181
aVand this can enable many different kinds of future applications,
p182
aVwhether you think about robots that build flood barriers
p183
aVor you think about robotic bee colonies that could pollinate crops
p184
aVor underwater schools of robots that monitor coral reefs,
p185
aVor if we reach for the stars and we thinking about programming
p186
aVconstellations of satellites.
p187
aVIn each of these systems,
p188
aVbeing able to understand how to design the rules of engagement
p189
aVand being able to create good collective behavior
p190
aVbecomes a key to realizing these visions.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, so far I've talked about rules for insects and for fish
p193
aVand for robots,
p194
aVbut what about the rules that apply to our own human collective?
p195
aVAnd the last thought that I'd like to leave you with
p196
aVis that science is of course itself
p197
aVan incredible manifestation of collective intelligence,
p198
aVbut unlike the beautiful fish schools that I study,
p199
aVI feel we still have a much longer evolutionary path to walk.
p200
aVSo in addition to working on improving the science of robot collectives,
p201
aVI also work on creating robots and thinking about rules
p202
aVthat will improve our own scientific collective.
p203
aVThere's this saying that I love:
p204
aVwho does science determines what science gets done.
p205
aVImagine a society
p206
aVwhere we had rules of engagement
p207
aVwhere every child grew up believing that they could stand here
p208
aVand be a technologist of the future,
p209
aVor where every adult
p210
aVbelieved that they had the ability not just to understand but to change
p211
aVhow science and technology impacts their everyday lives.
p212
aVWhat would that society look like?
p213
aVI believe that we can do that.
p214
aVI believe that we can choose our rules,
p215
aVand we engineer not just robots
p216
aVbut we can engineer our own human collective,
p217
aVand if we do and when we do, it will be beautiful.
