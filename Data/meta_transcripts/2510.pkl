VWe have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,
p4
aVhow they lived,
p5
aVhow they fought ...
p6
aVbut how did they think?
p7
aa(lp8
VOne natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought \u2014
p9
aVour ability to imagine,
p10
aVto be conscious,
p11
aVto dream \u2014
p12
aVhave always been the same.
p13
aVAnother possibility
p14
aVis that the social transformations that have shaped our culture
p15
aVmay have also changed the structural columns of human thought.
p16
aa(lp17
VWe may all have different opinions about this.
p18
aVActually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate.
p19
aVBut is this question even amenable to science?
p20
aa(lp21
VHere I'd like to propose
p22
aVthat in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked
p23
aVjust based on a few bricks,
p24
aVthat the writings of a culture are the archaeological records,
p25
aVthe fossils, of human thought.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd in fact,
p28
aVdoing some form of psychological analysis
p29
aVof some of the most ancient books of human culture,
p30
aVJulian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis:
p31
aVthat only 3,000 years ago,
p32
aVhumans were what today we would call schizophrenics.
p33
aVAnd he made this claim
p34
aVbased on the fact that the first humans described in these books
p35
aVbehaved consistently,
p36
aVin different traditions and in different places of the world,
p37
aVas if they were hearing and obeying voices
p38
aVthat they perceived as coming from the Gods,
p39
aVor from the muses ...
p40
aVwhat today we would call hallucinations.
p41
aVAnd only then, as time went on,
p42
aVthey began to recognize that they were the creators,
p43
aVthe owners of these inner voices.
p44
aVAnd with this, they gained introspection:
p45
aVthe ability to think about their own thoughts.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,
p48
aVat least in the way we perceive it today,
p49
aVwhere we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence \u2014
p50
aVis a quite recent cultural development.
p51
aVAnd this theory is quite spectacular,
p52
aVbut it has an obvious problem
p53
aVwhich is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples.
p54
aVSo the question is whether the theory
p55
aVthat introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago
p56
aVcan be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious.
p59
aVIt's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote,
p60
aV"Hello, I'm Plato,
p61
aVand as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness."
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem.
p66
aVWe need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said.
p67
aVThe word introspection does not appear a single time
p68
aVin the books we want to analyze.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo our way to solve this is to build the space of words.
p71
aVThis is a huge space that contains all words
p72
aVin such a way that the distance between any two of them
p73
aVis indicative of how closely related they are.
p74
aVSo for instance,
p75
aVyou want the words "dog" and "cat" to be very close together,
p76
aVbut the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm" to be very far away.
p77
aVAnd this has to be true for any two words within the space.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd there are different ways that we can construct the space of words.
p80
aVOne is just asking the experts,
p81
aVa bit like we do with dictionaries.
p82
aVAnother possibility
p83
aVis following the simple assumption that when two words are related,
p84
aVthey tend to appear in the same sentences,
p85
aVin the same paragraphs,
p86
aVin the same documents,
p87
aVmore often than would be expected just by pure chance.
p88
aVAnd this simple hypothesis,
p89
aVthis simple method,
p90
aVwith some computational tricks
p91
aVthat have to do with the fact
p92
aVthat this is a very complex and high-dimensional space,
p93
aVturns out to be quite effective.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd just to give you a flavor of how well this works,
p96
aVthis is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words.
p97
aVAnd you can see first
p98
aVthat words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods.
p99
aVSo you get the fruits, the body parts,
p100
aVthe computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.
p103
aVSo for instance,
p104
aVyou can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories
p105
aVof the astronomic and the physics terms.
p106
aVAnd then there are very fine things.
p107
aVFor instance, the word astronomy,
p108
aVwhich seems a bit bizarre where it is,
p109
aVis actually exactly where it should be,
p110
aVbetween what it is,
p111
aVan actual science,
p112
aVand between what it describes,
p113
aVthe astronomical terms.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd we could go on and on with this.
p116
aVActually, if you stare at this for a while,
p117
aVand you just build random trajectories,
p118
aVyou will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry.
p119
aVAnd this is because, in a way,
p120
aVwalking in this space is like walking in the mind.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd the last thing
p123
aVis that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions,
p124
aVof which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection.
p125
aVSo for instance,
p126
aVwords such as "self," "guilt," "reason," "emotion,"
p127
aVare very close to "introspection,"
p128
aVbut other words,
p129
aVsuch as "red," "football," "candle," "banana,"
p130
aVare just very far away.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd so once we've built the space,
p133
aVthe question of the history of introspection,
p134
aVor of the history of any concept
p135
aVwhich before could seem abstract and somehow vague,
p136
aVbecomes concrete \u2014
p137
aVbecomes amenable to quantitative science.
p138
aa(lp139
VAll that we have to do is take the books,
p140
aVwe digitize them,
p141
aVand we take this stream of words as a trajectory
p142
aVand project them into the space,
p143
aVand then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time
p144
aVcircling closely to the concept of introspection.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd with this,
p147
aVwe could analyze the history of introspection
p148
aVin the ancient Greek tradition,
p149
aVfor which we have the best available written record.
p150
aVSo what we did is we took all the books \u2014
p151
aVwe just ordered them by time \u2014
p152
aVfor each book we take the words
p153
aVand we project them to the space,
p154
aVand then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection,
p155
aVand we just average that.
p156
aVAnd then we ask whether, as time goes on and on,
p157
aVthese books get closer, and closer and closer
p158
aVto the concept of introspection.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition.
p161
aVSo you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition,
p162
aVthere is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection.
p163
aVBut about four centuries before Christ,
p164
aVthis starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase
p165
aVof books getting closer, and closer and closer
p166
aVto the concept of introspection.
p167
aVAnd one of the nice things about this
p168
aVis that now we can ask
p169
aVwhether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition,
p172
aVand we got virtually the same pattern.
p173
aVAgain, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament,
p174
aVand then it increases much more rapidly
p175
aVin the new books of the New Testament.
p176
aVAnd then we get the peak of introspection
p177
aVin "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"
p178
aVabout four centuries after Christ.
p179
aVAnd this was very important,
p180
aVbecause Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars,
p181
aVphilologists, historians,
p182
aVas one of the founders of introspection.
p183
aVActually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo our algorithm,
p186
aVwhich has the virtue of being quantitative,
p187
aVof being objective,
p188
aVand of course of being extremely fast \u2014
p189
aVit just runs in a fraction of a second \u2014
p190
aVcan capture some of the most important conclusions
p191
aVof this long tradition of investigation.
p192
aVAnd this is in a way one of the beauties of science,
p193
aVwhich is that now this idea can be translated
p194
aVand generalized to a whole lot of different domains.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness,
p197
aVmaybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves
p198
aVis whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness.
p199
aVTo put it more precisely,
p200
aVwhether the words we say today
p201
aVcan tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days,
p202
aVin a few months
p203
aVor a few years from now.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors
p206
aVthat detect our heart rate,
p207
aVour respiration,
p208
aVour genes,
p209
aVon the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases,
p210
aVwe can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak,
p211
aVwe tweet, we email, we write,
p212
aVcan tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds.
p213
aVAnd with Guillermo Cecchi,
p214
aVwho has been my brother in this adventure,
p215
aVwe took on this task.
p216
aVAnd we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people
p217
aVwho were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd so what we did is, we measured speech at day one,
p220
aVand then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict,
p221
aVwithin a window of almost three years,
p222
aVthe future development of psychosis.
p223
aVBut despite our hopes,
p224
aVwe got failure after failure.
p225
aVThere was just not enough information in semantics
p226
aVto predict the future organization of the mind.
p227
aVIt was good enough
p228
aVto distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group,
p229
aVa bit like we had done for the ancient texts,
p230
aVbut not to predict the future onset of psychosis.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut then we realized
p233
aVthat maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying,
p234
aVbut how they were saying it.
p235
aVMore specifically,
p236
aVit was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were,
p237
aVbut how far and fast they jumped
p238
aVfrom one semantic neighborhood to the other one.
p239
aVAnd so we came up with this measure,
p240
aVwhich we termed semantic coherence,
p241
aVwhich essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic,
p242
aVwithin one semantic category.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people,
p245
aVthe algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict,
p246
aVwith 100 percent accuracy,
p247
aVwho developed psychosis and who will not.
p248
aVAnd this was something that could not be achieved \u2014
p249
aVnot even close \u2014
p250
aVwith all the other existing clinical measures.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd I remember vividly, while I was working on this,
p253
aVI was sitting at my computer
p254
aVand I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo \u2014
p255
aVPolo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires,
p256
aVand at the time he was living in New York.
p257
aVAnd there was something in this tweets \u2014
p258
aVI could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly \u2014
p259
aVbut I got this strong hunch,
p260
aVthis strong intuition, that something was going wrong.
p261
aVSo I picked up the phone, and I called Polo,
p262
aVand in fact he was not feeling well.
p263
aVAnd this simple fact,
p264
aVthat reading in between the lines,
p265
aVI could sense, through words, his feelings,
p266
aVwas a simple, but very effective way to help.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhat I tell you today
p269
aVis that we're getting close to understanding
p270
aVhow we can convert this intuition that we all have,
p271
aVthat we all share,
p272
aVinto an algorithm.
p273
aVAnd in doing so,
p274
aVwe may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health,
p275
aVbased on objective, quantitative and automated analysis
p276
aVof the words we write,
p277
aVof the words we say.
