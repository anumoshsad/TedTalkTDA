VI am honored to be here,
p4
aVand I'm honored to talk about this topic,
p5
aVwhich I think is of grave importance.
p6
aVWe've been talking a lot
p7
aVabout the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species,
p8
aVbut plastic hurts people, too \u2014
p9
aVespecially poor people.
p10
aVAnd both in the production of plastic,
p11
aVthe use of plastic and the disposal of plastic,
p12
aVthe people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads
p13
aVare poor people.
p14
aVPeople got very upset
p15
aVwhen the BP oil spill happened,
p16
aVfor very good reason.
p17
aVPeople thought, "Oh, my God.
p18
aVThis is terrible, this oil \u2014 it's in the water.
p19
aVIt's going to destroy the living systems there.
p20
aVPeople are going to be hurt.
p21
aVThis is a terrible thing,
p22
aVthis oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf."
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat people don't think about is:
p25
aVWhat if the oil had made it safely to shore?
p26
aVWhat if the oil actually got where it was trying to go?
p27
aVNot only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming,
p28
aVbut there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"
p29
aVand the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"
p30
aVis because the petrochemical industry
p31
aVtakes that oil and turns it into plastic
p32
aVand in the process, kills people.
p33
aVIt shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf.
p34
aVSo oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill;
p35
aVthey're a problem when there's not.
p36
aVAnd what we don't often appreciate
p37
aVis the price that poor people pay
p38
aVfor us to have these disposable products.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe other thing we often don't appreciate is,
p41
aVit's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer.
p42
aVPoor people also suffer at the point of use.
p43
aVThose of us who earn a certain income level,
p44
aVwe have something called choice.
p45
aVThe reason why you want to work hard and have a job
p46
aVand not be poor and broke
p47
aVis so you can have choices, economic choices.
p48
aVWe actually get a chance to choose not to use products
p49
aVthat have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them.
p50
aVOther people who are poor don't have those choices.
p51
aVSo low-income people often are the ones
p52
aVwho are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them
p53
aVthat their children are using.
p54
aVThose are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount
p55
aVof this poisonous plastic in using it.
p56
aVAnd people say, "Well, they should just buy a different product."
p57
aVWell, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices.
p58
aVYou often have to buy the cheapest products.
p59
aVThe cheapest products are often the most dangerous.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd if that weren't bad enough \u2014
p62
aVif it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer
p63
aVin places like Cancer Alley,
p64
aVand shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use \u2014
p65
aVat the point of disposal,
p66
aVonce again, it's poor people who bear the burden.
p67
aVOften, we think we're doing a good thing:
p68
aVYou're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is,
p69
aVand you think to yourself, "I'm going to throw this away.
p70
aVNo \u2014 I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin."
p71
aVYou think, "I put mine in the blue bin."
p72
aVAnd then you look at your colleague and say,
p73
aV"Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin."
p74
aVAnd we use that as a moral tickle.
p75
aVWe feel so good about ourselves.
p76
aVIf we \u2014 well, OK, I'm just ... me.
p77
aVNot you, but I feel this way often.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment.
p82
aVBut if we were to be able to follow that little bottle
p83
aVon its journey,
p84
aVwe would be shocked to discover that, all too often,
p85
aVthat bottle is going to be put on a boat,
p86
aVit's going to go all the way across the ocean
p87
aVat some expense,
p88
aVand it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China.
p89
aVI think in our minds, we imagine
p90
aVsomebody's going to take the little bottle and say,
p91
aV"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle."
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
V"You've served so well."
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VHe's given a little bottle massage,
p100
aVa little bottle medal.
p101
aVAnd they say, "What would you like to do next?"
p102
aVThe little bottle says, "I just don't know ..."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VBut that's not actually what happens.
p107
aVYou know?
p108
aVThat bottle winds up getting burned.
p109
aVThe recycling of plastic in many developing countries
p110
aVmeans the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic,
p111
aVwhich releases incredible toxic chemicals
p112
aVand, once again, kills people.
p113
aVAnd so, poor people who are making these products
p114
aVin petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley,
p115
aVpoor people who are consuming these products disproportionately,
p116
aVand then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling,
p117
aVare having their lives shortened.
p118
aVThey're all being harmed \u2014 greatly \u2014
p119
aVby this addiction that we have to disposability.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, you think to yourself \u2014 I know how you are \u2014
p122
aVyou say, "That sure is terrible for those poor people.
p123
aVIt's just awful. Those poor people.
p124
aVI hope someone does something to help them."
p125
aVBut what we don't understand is \u2014
p126
aVhere we are in Los Angeles.
p127
aVWe worked very hard to get the smog reduction
p128
aVhappening here in Los Angeles.
p129
aVBut guess what?
p130
aVBecause they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now,
p131
aVbecause the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now,
p132
aValmost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains
p133
aVthat we've achieved here in California
p134
aVhave been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia.
p135
aVSo we all are being hit. We all are being impacted.
p136
aVIt's just that the poor people get it first and worst.
p137
aVBut the dirty production, the burning of toxins,
p138
aVthe lack of environmental standards in Asia,
p139
aVis actually creating so much dirty air pollution,
p140
aVit's coming across the ocean,
p141
aVand has erased our gains here in California.
p142
aVWe're back where we were in the 1970s.
p143
aVAnd so we're on one planet,
p144
aVand we have to be able to get to the root of these problems.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe root of this problem, in my view,
p147
aVis the idea of disposability itself.
p148
aVYou see, if you understand the link
p149
aVbetween what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet
p150
aVand what we're doing to poor people,
p151
aVyou arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight:
p152
aVIn order to trash the planet,
p153
aVyou have to trash people.
p154
aVBut if you create a world where you don't trash people,
p155
aVyou can't trash the planet.
p156
aVSo now we are at a moment
p157
aVwhere the coming together of social justice as an idea
p158
aVand ecology as an idea,
p159
aVwe finally can now see
p160
aVthat they are really, at the end of the day, one idea.
p161
aVAnd it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything.
p162
aVWe don't have disposable resources.
p163
aVWe don't have disposable species.
p164
aVAnd we don't have disposable people, either.
p165
aVWe don't have a throwaway planet,
p166
aVand we don't have throwaway children \u2014 it's all precious.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding,
p169
aVnew opportunities for action begin to emerge.
p170
aVBiomimicry,
p171
aVwhich is an emerging science,
p172
aVwinds up being a very important social justice idea.
p173
aVPeople who are just learning about this stuff:
p174
aVbiomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.
p175
aVDemocracy, by the way,
p176
aVmeans respecting the wisdom of all people \u2014 we'll get to that.
p177
aVBut biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.
p178
aVIt turns out we're a pretty clever species.
p179
aVWe have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves.
p180
aVBut if we want to make something hard,
p181
aVwe say, "I know! I'm going to make a hard substance.
p182
aVI know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces
p183
aVand drag stuff out of the ground
p184
aVand get things hot and poison and pollute ...
p185
aVBut I got this hard thing!"
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
V"I'm so clever!"
p190
aVAnd you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you.
p191
aVBut guess what?
p192
aVYou're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam.
p193
aa(lp194
VA clamshell is hard.
p195
aVThere's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces.
p196
aVThere's no poison. There's no pollution.
p197
aVIt turns out that other species figured out a long time ago
p198
aVhow to create many of the things we need
p199
aVusing biological processes that nature knows how to use well.
p200
aVThat insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing
p201
aVthat we have as much to learn from other species \u2014
p202
aVI don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff.
p203
aVI don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species.
p204
aVI mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved.
p205
aVThat's called biomimicry,
p206
aVand that opens the door to zero waste production;
p207
aVzero pollution production;
p208
aVthat we could actually enjoy
p209
aVa high quality of life, a high standard of living,
p210
aVwithout trashing the planet.
p211
aa(lp212
VWell, that idea of biomimicry,
p213
aVrespecting the wisdom of all species,
p214
aVcombined with the idea of democracy and social justice,
p215
aVrespecting the wisdom and the worth of all people,
p216
aVwould give us a different society.
p217
aVWe would have a different economy.
p218
aVWe would have a green society
p219
aVthat Dr. King would be proud of.
p220
aVThat should be the goal.
p221
aVAnd the way that we get there is to first of all recognize
p222
aVthat the idea of disposability
p223
aVnot only hurts the species we've talked about,
p224
aVbut it even corrupts our own society.
p225
aa(lp226
VWe're so proud to live here in California.
p227
aVWe just had this vote, and everybody's like,
p228
aV"Well \u2014 not in our state!"
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VI don't know what those other states were doing, but ..."
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VJust so proud.
p237
aVAnd, yeah, I'm proud, too.
p238
aVBut ...
p239
aVCalifornia, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff,
p240
aVwe also, unfortunately, lead the world
p241
aVin some of the gulag stuff.
p242
aVCalifornia has one of the highest incarceration rates
p243
aVof all the 50 states.
p244
aVWe have a moral challenge in this movement.
p245
aVWe are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill,
p246
aVbut sometimes not as passionate
p247
aVabout rescuing living beings, living people.
p248
aVAnd I would say that we live in a country \u2014
p249
aVfive percent of the world's population,
p250
aV25 percent of the greenhouse gases,
p251
aVbut also 25 percent of the world's prisoners.
p252
aVOne of every four people locked up anywhere in the world
p253
aVis locked up right here in the United States.
p254
aVSo that is consistent with this idea
p255
aVthat disposability is something we believe in.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd yet,
p258
aVas a movement that has to broaden its constituency,
p259
aVthat has to grow,
p260
aVthat has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone,
p261
aVone of the challenges to the success of this movement,
p262
aVof getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift,
p263
aVis people look at our movement with some suspicion.
p264
aVAnd they ask a question, and the question is:
p265
aVHow can these people be so passionate?
p266
aVA poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley,
p267
aVsomebody in Watts,
p268
aVsomebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation,
p269
aVmight say to themselves \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014
p270
aV"How can these people be so passionate
p271
aVabout making sure
p272
aVthat a plastic bottle has a second chance in life,
p273
aVor an aluminum can has a second chance,
p274
aVand yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison,
p275
aVhe doesn't get a second chance?"
p276
aV"How can this movement be so passionate about saying
p277
aVwe don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials,
p278
aVand yet accept throwaway lives
p279
aVand throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?"
p280
aVAnd so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement.
p281
aVWhen we take on topics like this,
p282
aVit gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements
p283
aVand to become more inclusive and to grow,
p284
aVand we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in.
p285
aa(lp286
VMost of you are good, softhearted people.
p287
aVWhen you were younger, you cared about the whole world,
p288
aVand at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue,
p289
aVyou had to boil your love down to an issue.
p290
aV"Can't love the whole world \u2014
p291
aVyou've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration.
p292
aVYou've got to shrink it down and be about one issue."
p293
aVAnd really, they fundamentally told you,
p294
aV"Are you going to hug a tree?
p295
aVOr are you going to hug a child? Pick.
p296
aVAre you going to hug a tree?
p297
aVOr are you going to hug a child? Pick."
p298
aVWell, when you start working on issues like plastic,
p299
aVyou realize the whole thing is connected.
p300
aVAnd luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms \u2014
p301
aVwe can hug both.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you very much.
