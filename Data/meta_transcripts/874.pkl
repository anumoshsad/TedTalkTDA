VTom Green: That's a 4chan thing.
p4
aVThese kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids
p5
aVand they like to say funny words
p6
aVlike "barrel roll."
p7
aVIt's a video game move from "Star Fox."
p8
aV"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")
p9
aVTom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.
p10
aVI got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.
p11
aVSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,
p12
aV"4chan!"
p13
aa(lp14
VChristopher Poole: When I was 15,
p15
aVI found this website called Futaba Channel.
p16
aVAnd it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.
p17
aVThat format of forum, at that time,
p18
aVwas not well-known outside of Japan.
p19
aVAnd so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,
p20
aVand I stuck it up for my friends to use.
p21
aVNow, six and a half years later,
p22
aVover seven million people are using it,
p23
aVcontributing over 700,000 posts per day.
p24
aVAnd we've gone from one board
p25
aVto 48 boards.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is what it looks like.
p28
aVSo, what's unique about the site
p29
aVis that it's anonymous,
p30
aVand it has no memory.
p31
aVThere's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.
p32
aVThese things that we're used to with forums
p33
aVdon't exist on 4chan.
p34
aVAnd that's led to this
p35
aVdiscussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.
p36
aVWhat the site's known for,
p37
aVbecause it has this environment,
p38
aVis it's fostered the creation of a lot of
p39
aVInternet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."
p40
aa(lp41
VTwo of the largest memes that have come out of this site
p42
aVsome of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats \u2014
p43
aVjust silly pictures of cats with text.
p44
aVAnd this resonates with millions of people, apparently,
p45
aVbecause there are tens of thousands of these,
p46
aVand there is a whole blogging empire now
p47
aVdedicated to pictures like these.
p48
aVAnd Rick Astley's kind of rebirth
p49
aVthese past two years ...
p50
aVRickroll was this bait and switch,
p51
aVreally simple, classic bait and switch.
p52
aVSomebody says they're linking to something interesting,
p53
aVand you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.
p54
aVAnd it got big enough to the point where
p55
aVthere was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,
p56
aVand Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls
p57
aVmillions of people on television.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VThere are thousands of memes that come out of the site.
p61
aVThere are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,
p62
aVthe ones I've just shown you,
p63
aVbut every day, every month,
p64
aVpeople are producing thousands of these.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo does a site like this have rules?
p67
aVWe do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,
p68
aVwhich are more-or-less ignored by the community.
p69
aVAnd so they've come up with their own set of rules,
p70
aVthe "Rules of the Internet."
p71
aVAnd so there are three that I want to show you specifically.
p72
aVRule one is you don't talk about /b/.
p73
aVTwo is you do not talk about /b/.
p74
aVAnd this one's kind of interesting:
p75
aV"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVAnd I will spare you that slide.
p78
aVI assure you, it is very true.
p79
aa(lp80
V/b/ is the first board we started with,
p81
aVand it is, in many ways,
p82
aVthe beating heart of the website.
p83
aVIt is where a third of all the traffic is going.
p84
aVAnd /b/ is known for,
p85
aVmore than anything,
p86
aVnot just the memes they've created, but the exploits.
p87
aVAnd Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,
p88
aVand that was the Time 100 poll.
p89
aVSo somebody at Time, at the magazine,
p90
aVthought it would be fun to nominate me
p91
aVfor this thing they did last year.
p92
aVAnd so they placed me on it,
p93
aVand the Internet got wind of it. My community
p94
aVdecided they wanted me to win it.
p95
aVI didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.
p96
aVAnd so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVSo they broke that poll.
p99
aVAnd I ended up on top.
p100
aVI ended up at this really fancy party.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut that's not what's interesting about this.
p103
aVIt's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;
p104
aVthey were actually \u2014
p105
aVit got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed
p106
aVall of the top 21 places
p107
aVto spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVThe amount of time and effort that went into that
p110
aVis absolutely incredible.
p111
aVAnd "marble cake" is significant because
p112
aVit is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.
p113
aVAnonymous is this group of people
p114
aVthat protested, very famously,
p115
aVScientology.
p116
aVThe story is,
p117
aVScientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.
p118
aVThey got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
p119
aVAnd so these people, over 7,000 people,
p120
aVless than one month later,
p121
aVorganized in a hundred cities around the globe and \u2014
p122
aVthis is L.A. \u2014
p123
aVprotested the Church of Scientology,
p124
aVand they have continued to do so,
p125
aVnow, two full years after the fact.
p126
aVThey are still protesting.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVSo we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group
p129
aVthat's come out of the site.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd last, I'm going to show you the example,
p132
aVthe story of Dusty the cat.
p133
aVDusty is the name that we've given to this cat.
p134
aVThis young man
p135
aVposted a video
p136
aVof him abusing his cat on YouTube.
p137
aVAnd, you know, this didn't sit well with people,
p138
aVand so there was this outpouring of support
p139
aVfor people to do something about this.
p140
aVSo what they did is they \u2014 I mean, they put CSI to shame here \u2014
p141
aVthe Internet detectives came out.
p142
aVThey matched, they found his MySpace.
p143
aVThey took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.
p144
aVWithin 24 hours,
p145
aVthey had his name,
p146
aVand within 48 hours, he was arrested.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd so, what I think is really intriguing
p151
aVabout a community like 4chan
p152
aVis just that it's this open place.
p153
aVAs I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.
p154
aVAnd sites like it are kind of
p155
aVgoing the way of the dinosaur right now.
p156
aVThey're endangered because we're moving
p157
aVtowards social networking.
p158
aVWe're moving towards persistent identity.
p159
aVWe're moving towards,
p160
aVyou know, a lack of privacy, really.
p161
aVWe're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,
p162
aVmoving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.
p163
aa(lp164
VThank you.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p169
aVGot a couple questions for you.
p170
aVBut if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?
p171
aa(lp172
VCP: You're lucky that this is not
p173
aVbeing streamed to them live right now.
p174
aa(lp175
VCA: Well, you never know. Some of them \u2014
p176
aVwe've got people in 75 countries out there watching.
p177
aVDon't tell.
p178
aVBut seriously,
p179
aVthis issue on anonymity is \u2014
p180
aVI mean, you made the case there.
p181
aVBut anonymity basically allows people to say anything,
p182
aVall the rules gone.
p183
aVYou've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.
p184
aVAnd I'm just curious whether you
p185
aVsometimes lie awake in the night
p186
aVworrying that you've opened Pandora's box.
p187
aa(lp188
VCP: Yes and no.
p189
aVI mean, for as much good
p190
aVthat kind of comes out of this environment,
p191
aVthere is plenty of bad.
p192
aVThere are plenty of downsides.
p193
aVBut I think that the greater good
p194
aVis being served here by just allowing people \u2014
p195
aVthere are very few places, now, where you can go
p196
aVand not have identity, to be completely anonymous
p197
aVand say whatever you'd like.
p198
aVAnd saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.
p199
aVDoing whatever you like is now crossing a line.
p200
aVBut I think it's important to have these places.
p201
aVWhen I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,
p202
aVthis outlet, where I can come after work
p203
aVand be myself."
p204
aa(lp205
VCA: But words, saying things,
p206
aVyou know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.
p207
aVAnd if you cut the link between what is said
p208
aVand any attribution back to you,
p209
aVI mean, surely there are huge risks with that.
p210
aa(lp211
VCP: There are, certainly.
p212
aVBut \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
VCA: Tell me about what \u2014 I mean, I think you asked the board
p215
aVwhat you might say at TED, right?
p216
aa(lp217
VCP: Yeah, I posted a thread
p218
aVon Sunday.
p219
aVAnd within 24 hours,
p220
aVit had over 12,000 responses.
p221
aVAnd the thing is,
p222
aVI didn't make it into that presentation
p223
aVbecause I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aV99 percent of it is just,
p226
aVwould have been, you know, bleeped out.
p227
aVBut there were some good things that came out of that too.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVLove and peace were mentioned.
p230
aa(lp231
VCA: Love and peace were mentioned,
p232
aVkind of with quote marks around them, right?
p233
aa(lp234
VCP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.
p235
aVCA: And that content is all off the board now.
p236
aVRight, it's gone? Or is it still up there?
p237
aa(lp238
VCP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.
p239
aVIt went up to about 16,000 posts,
p240
aVand now it has been taken off.
p241
aa(lp242
VCA: Okay, well.
p243
aVNow, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended
p244
aVeveryone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
p245
aVChris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.
p246
aVYou've got this surprising
p247
aVsemi-underground influence,
p248
aVbut it's not making you a lot of money, yet.
p249
aVWhat's the commercial picture here?
p250
aa(lp251
VCP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't
p252
aVmuch of one, I guess.
p253
aVThe site has adult content on it.
p254
aVI mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,
p255
aVjust in terms of language alone.
p256
aVAnd when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed
p257
aVany hope of making lots of money.
p258
aa(lp259
VCA: But you still live at home, right?
p260
aa(lp261
VCP: I actually moved out recently.
p262
aa(lp263
VCA: That's very cool.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VCP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now.
p268
aa(lp269
VCA: But what conversations did you or do you
p270
aVhave with your mother about 4chan?
p271
aa(lp272
VCP: At first, very kind of pained,
p273
aVawkward conversations.
p274
aVThe content is not dinner table conversation in the least.
p275
aVBut my parents \u2014 I think part of why
p276
aVthey kind of are able to appreciate it
p277
aVis because they don't understand it.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVCA: And they were probably pleased to see you
p280
aVon top of the Time poll.
p281
aa(lp282
VCP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VCA: And so, in 10 years' time,
p287
aVwhat do you picture yourself doing?
p288
aa(lp289
VCP: That's a good question.
p290
aVAs I said, I just went back to school,
p291
aVand I am considering
p292
aVmajoring in urban studies
p293
aVand then going on to urban planning,
p294
aVkind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities
p295
aVand trying to adapt that
p296
aVto a physical community.
p297
aa(lp298
