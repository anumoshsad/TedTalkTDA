(lp3
VSo we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness,
p4
aVbut also an immense power to do harm.
p5
aVAny tool can be used to build or to destroy.
p6
aVThat all depends on our motivation.
p7
aVTherefore, it is all the more important
p8
aVto foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo now we indeed are facing  many challenges in our times.
p11
aVThose could be personal challenges.
p12
aVOur own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy.
p13
aVThere's also societal challenges:
p14
aVpoverty in the midst of plenty, inequalities, conflict, injustice.
p15
aVAnd then there are the new challenges, which we don't expect.
p16
aVTen thousand years ago, there were about five million human beings on Earth.
p17
aVWhatever they could do,
p18
aVthe Earth's resilience  would soon heal human activities.
p19
aVAfter the Industrial and Technological Revolutions,
p20
aVthat's not the same anymore.
p21
aVWe are now the major agent of impact on our Earth.
p22
aVWe enter the Anthropocene, the era of human beings.
p23
aVSo in a way, if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth,
p24
aVendless use of material resources,
p25
aVit's like if this man was saying \u2014
p26
aVand I heard a former head of state, I won't mention who, saying \u2014
p27
aV"Five years ago, we were at the edge of the precipice.
p28
aVToday we made a big step forward."
p29
aVSo this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists
p30
aVas the planetary boundaries.
p31
aVAnd within those boundaries, they can carry a number of factors.
p32
aVWe can still prosper, humanity can still prosper for 150,000 years
p33
aVif we keep the same stability of climate
p34
aVas in the Holocene for the last 10,000 years.
p35
aVBut this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity,
p36
aVgrowing qualitatively, not quantitatively.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety.
p39
aVNow, in 1950 came the great acceleration.
p40
aVNow hold your breath, not too long, to imagine what comes next.
p41
aVNow we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries.
p42
aVJust to take biodiversity,  at the current rate,
p43
aVby 2050, 30 percent of all species  on Earth will have disappeared.
p44
aVEven if we keep their DNA in some fridge, that's not going to be reversible.
p45
aVSo here I am sitting
p46
aVin front of a 7,000-meter-high,  21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.
p47
aVAt the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo what can we do in that situation?
p50
aVWell, however complex politically, economically, scientifically
p51
aVthe question of the environment is,
p52
aVit simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness.
p53
aVI'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVGroucho Marx said, "Why should I care about future generations?
p56
aVWhat have they ever done for me?"
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVUnfortunately, I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes,
p59
aVon Fox News, saying exactly  the same thing, but seriously.
p60
aVHe was told about the rise of the ocean,
p61
aVand he said, "I find it absurd to change my behavior today
p62
aVfor something that will happen  in a hundred years."
p63
aVSo if you don't care for future generations,
p64
aVjust go for it.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo one of the main challenges of our times
p67
aVis to reconcile three time scales:
p68
aVthe short term of the economy,
p69
aVthe ups and downs of the stock market, the end-of-the-year accounts;
p70
aVthe midterm of the quality of life \u2014
p71
aVwhat is the quality every moment of our  life, over 10 years and 20 years? \u2014
p72
aVand the long term of the environment.
p73
aVWhen the environmentalists speak with economists,
p74
aVit's like a schizophrenic dialogue, completely incoherent.
p75
aVThey don't speak the same language.
p76
aVNow, for the last 10 years, I went around the world
p77
aVmeeting economists, scientists, neuroscientists, environmentalists,
p78
aVphilosophers, thinkers  in the Himalayas, all over the place.
p79
aVIt seems to me, there's only one concept
p80
aVthat can reconcile those three time scales.
p81
aVIt is simply having more consideration for others.
p82
aVIf you have more consideration for others, you will have a caring economics,
p83
aVwhere finance is at the service of society
p84
aVand not society at the service of finance.
p85
aVYou will not play at the casino
p86
aVwith the resources that people have entrusted you with.
p87
aVIf you have more consideration for others,
p88
aVyou will make sure that you remedy inequality,
p89
aVthat you bring some kind  of well-being within society,
p90
aVin education, at the workplace.
p91
aVOtherwise, a nation that is the most powerful and the richest
p92
aVbut everyone is miserable, what's the point?
p93
aVAnd if you have more consideration for others,
p94
aVyou are not going to ransack that planet that we have
p95
aVand at the current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo the question is,
p98
aVokay, altruism is the answer, it's not just a novel ideal,
p99
aVbut can it be a real, pragmatic solution?
p100
aVAnd first of all, does it exist,
p101
aVtrue altruism, or are we so selfish?
p102
aVSo some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish.
p103
aVBut are we really all just like rascals?
p104
aVThat's good news, isn't it?
p105
aVMany philosophers,  like Hobbes, have said so.
p106
aVBut not everyone looks like a rascal.
p107
aVOr is man a wolf for man?
p108
aVBut this guy doesn't seem too bad.
p109
aVHe's one of my friends in Tibet.
p110
aVHe's very kind.
p111
aVSo now, we love cooperation.
p112
aVThere's no better joy  than working together, is there?
p113
aVAnd then not only humans.
p114
aVThen, of course, there's the struggle for life,
p115
aVthe survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.
p116
aVBut in evolution, cooperation \u2014 though competition exists, of course \u2014
p117
aVcooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity.
p118
aVWe are super-cooperators  and we should even go further.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo now, on top of that, the quality of human relationships.
p121
aVThe OECD did a survey among 10 factors, including income, everything.
p122
aVThe first one that people said, that's the main thing for my happiness,
p123
aVis quality of social relationships.
p124
aVNot only in humans.
p125
aVAnd look at those great-grandmothers.
p126
aVSo now, this idea  that if we go deep within,
p127
aVwe are irredeemably selfish,
p128
aVthis is armchair science.
p129
aVThere is not a single sociological study,
p130
aVpsychological study, that's ever shown that.
p131
aVRather, the opposite.
p132
aVMy friend, Daniel Batson,  spent a whole life
p133
aVputting people in the lab in very complex situations.
p134
aVAnd of course we are sometimes selfish, and some people more than others.
p135
aVBut he found that systematically, no matter what,
p136
aVthere's a significant number of people
p137
aVwho do behave altruistically, no matter what.
p138
aVIf you see someone deeply wounded, great suffering,
p139
aVyou might just help out of empathic distress \u2014
p140
aVyou can't stand it, so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person.
p141
aVSo we tested all that, and in the end,  he said, clearly people can be altruistic.
p142
aVSo that's good news.
p143
aVAnd even further, we should look at the banality of goodness.
p144
aVNow look at here.
p145
aVWhen we come out, we aren't  going to say, "That's so nice.
p146
aVThere was no fistfight while this mob  was thinking about altruism."
p147
aVNo, that's expected, isn't it?
p148
aVIf there was a fistfight, we would speak of that for months.
p149
aVSo the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention,
p150
aVbut it exists.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, look at this.
p153
aVSo some psychologists said,
p154
aVwhen I tell them I run 140 humanitarian  projects in the Himalayas
p155
aVthat give me so much joy,
p156
aVthey said, "Oh, I see, you work for the warm glow.
p157
aVThat is not altruistic. You just feel good."
p158
aVYou think this guy, when he jumped in front of the train,
p159
aVhe thought, "I'm going to feel so good when this is over?"
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVBut that's not the end of it.
p162
aVThey say, well, but when you interviewed him, he said,
p163
aV"I had no choice. I had to jump, of course."
p164
aVHe has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic.
p165
aVNo choice?
p166
aVWell of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour,
p167
aV"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"
p168
aVHe does it. There is a choice, but it's obvious, it's immediate.
p169
aVAnd then, also, there he had a choice.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VThere are people who had choice, like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,
p173
aVand the whole village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.
p174
aVFor the whole Second World War, they saved 3,500 Jews,
p175
aVgave them shelter, brought them to Switzerland,
p176
aVagainst all odds, at the risk of their lives and those of their family.
p177
aVSo altruism does exist.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo what is altruism?
p180
aVIt is the wish: May others be happy and find the cause of happiness.
p181
aVNow, empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you,
p182
aVthis person is joyful, this person suffers.
p183
aVBut empathy alone is not sufficient.
p184
aVIf you keep on being confronted with suffering,
p185
aVyou might have empathic distress, burnout,
p186
aVso you need the greater sphere of loving-kindness.
p187
aVWith Tania Singer at the Max Planck  Institute of Leipzig,
p188
aVwe showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different.
p189
aVNow, that's all well done,
p190
aVso we got that from evolution, from maternal care, parental love,
p191
aVbut we need to extend that.
p192
aVIt can be extended even to other species.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, if we want a more altruistic society, we need two things:
p195
aVindividual change and societal change.
p196
aVSo is individual change possible?
p197
aVTwo thousand years of contemplative study said yes, it is.
p198
aVNow, 15 years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics
p199
aVsaid yes, our brains change when you train in altruism.
p200
aVSo I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.
p201
aVThis is the first time I went after two and a half hours.
p202
aVAnd then the result has been published in many scientific papers.
p203
aVIt shows without ambiguity that there is structural change
p204
aVand functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love.
p205
aVJust to give you an idea:
p206
aVthis is the meditator at rest on the left,
p207
aVmeditator in compassion meditation, you see all the activity,
p208
aVand then the control group at rest, nothing happened,
p209
aVin meditation, nothing happened.
p210
aVThey have not been trained.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo do you need 50,000 hours  of meditation? No, you don't.
p213
aVFour weeks, 20 minutes a day, of caring, mindfulness meditation
p214
aValready brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group.
p215
aVThat's only 20 minutes a day for four weeks.
p216
aa(lp217
VEven with preschoolers \u2014 Richard Davidson did that in Madison.
p218
aVAn eight-week program: gratitude, loving- kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.
p219
aVYou would say,  "Oh, they're just preschoolers."
p220
aVLook after eight weeks,
p221
aVthe pro-social behavior, that's the blue line.
p222
aVAnd then comes the ultimate scientific test, the stickers test.
p223
aVBefore, you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class,
p224
aVtheir least favorite child, an unknown child, and the sick child,
p225
aVand they have to give stickers away.
p226
aVSo before the intervention, they give most of it to their best friend.
p227
aVFour, five years old,  20 minutes three times a week.
p228
aVAfter the intervention, no more discrimination:
p229
aVthe same amount of stickers to their  best friend and the least favorite child.
p230
aVThat's something we should do in all the schools in the world.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow where do we go from there?
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VWhen the Dalai Lama heard that, he told Richard Davidson,
p237
aV"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools, the U.N., the whole world."
p238
aa(lp239
VSo now where do we go from there?
p240
aVIndividual change is possible.
p241
aVNow do we have to wait for an altruistic  gene to be in the human race?
p242
aVThat will take 50,000 years, too much for the environment.
p243
aVFortunately, there is the evolution of culture.
p244
aVCultures, as specialists have shown, change faster than genes.
p245
aVThat's the good news.
p246
aVLook, attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years.
p247
aVSo now individual change and cultural  change mutually fashion each other,
p248
aVand yes, we can achieve a more altruistic society.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo where do we go from there?
p251
aVMyself, I will go back to the East.
p252
aVNow we treat 100,000 patients a year in our projects.
p253
aVWe have 25,000 kids in school, four percent overhead.
p254
aVSome people say, "Well, your stuff works in practice,
p255
aVbut does it work in theory?"
p256
aVThere's always positive deviance.
p257
aVSo I will also go back to my hermitage
p258
aVto find the inner resources to better serve others.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut on the more global level, what can we do?
p261
aVWe need three things.
p262
aVEnhancing cooperation:
p263
aVCooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning,
p264
aVUnconditional cooperation within corporations \u2014
p265
aVthere can be some competition between corporations, but not within.
p266
aVWe need sustainable harmony. I love this term.
p267
aVNot sustainable growth anymore.
p268
aVSustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality.
p269
aVIn the future, we do more with less,
p270
aVand we continue to grow qualitatively, not quantitatively.
p271
aVWe need caring economics.
p272
aVThe Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty,
p273
aVcannot deal with the problem of the common goods
p274
aVof the atmosphere, of the oceans.
p275
aVWe need a caring economics.
p276
aVIf you say economics should be compassionate,
p277
aVthey say, "That's not our job."
p278
aVBut if you say they don't care, that looks bad.
p279
aVWe need local commitment, global responsibility.
p280
aVWe need to extend altruism to the other 1.6 million species.
p281
aVSentient beings  are co-citizens in this world.
p282
aVand we need to dare altruism.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, long live the altruistic revolution.
p285
aVViva la revolución de altruismo.
p286
