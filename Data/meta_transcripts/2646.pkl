VSo, my journey began in the Bronx, New York,
p4
aVin a one-bedroom apartment,
p5
aVwith my two sisters and immigrant mother.
p6
aVI loved our neighborhood.
p7
aVIt was lively.
p8
aVThere was all this merengue blasting,
p9
aVneighbors socializing on building stoops
p10
aVand animated conversations over domino playing.
p11
aVIt was home,
p12
aVand it was sweet.
p13
aVBut it wasn't simple.
p14
aVIn fact, everyone at school knew the block where we lived,
p15
aVbecause it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs.
p16
aVAnd with drug-dealing comes conflict,
p17
aVso we often went to sleep to the sound of gunshots.
p18
aa(lp19
VI spent much of my childhood worried,
p20
aVworried about our safety.
p21
aVAnd so did our mother.
p22
aVShe worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives;
p23
aVthat our poverty meant
p24
aVthat the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space
p25
aVwould harm us.
p26
aVOur entire life was in the Bronx,
p27
aVbut my mother's anxiety spurred her into action,
p28
aVand soon we were driving so fast to Connecticut \u2014
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
Vto boarding school campuses, with full scholarships in tow.
p33
aVMan, don't underestimate the power of a mother
p34
aVdetermined to keep her children safe.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Cheers)
p37
aV(Applause)
p38
aa(lp39
VAt boarding school,
p40
aVfor the first time,
p41
aVI was able to sleep without worry.
p42
aVI could leave my dorm room unlocked,
p43
aVwalk barefoot in the grass,
p44
aVand look up to see a night sky full of stars.
p45
aVHappy novelties.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut there were other novelties as well.
p48
aVVery quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.
p49
aVI learned that I didn't speak the right way,
p50
aVand to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking,
p51
aVmy teachers gave me frequent lessons, in public,
p52
aVon the appropriate way to enunciate certain words.
p53
aa(lp54
VA teacher once instructed me in the hallway:
p55
aV"Aaaaaas-king."
p56
aVShe said this loudly.
p57
aV"Dena, it's not 'axing,' like you're running around with an axe.
p58
aVThat's silly."
p59
aa(lp60
VNow at this point, you can imagine the snickers of my classmates,
p61
aVbut she continued:
p62
aV"Think about breaking the word into 'ass' and 'king,'
p63
aVand then put the two together to say it correctly \u2014
p64
aV'Asking.'"
p65
aa(lp66
VThere were some other moments that reminded me that I didn't belong.
p67
aVOnce, I walked into a classmate's dorm room,
p68
aVand I watched her watch her valuables around me.
p69
aVLike, why would she do that? I thought to myself.
p70
aVAnd then there was the time
p71
aVwhen another classmate walked into my dorm room,
p72
aVand yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying hair grease to my scalp.
p73
aa(lp74
VThere is emotional damage done when young people can't be themselves,
p75
aVwhen they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable.
p76
aVIt's a kind of violence.
p77
aa(lp78
VUltimately, I'm a quintessential success story.
p79
aVI attended boarding school and college in New England,
p80
aVstudied abroad in Chile
p81
aVand returned to the Bronx to be a middle school teacher.
p82
aVI received a Truman Scholarship,
p83
aVa Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.
p84
aVAnd I could list more.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VBut I won't.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI earned my doctorate at Columbia University.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Cheers)
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd then I landed a job at Yale.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VI am proud of everything that I've been able to accomplish
p103
aVon my journey thus far.
p104
aa(lp105
VI have eternal imposter syndrome.
p106
aVEither I've been invited because I'm a token,
p107
aVwhich really isn't about me,
p108
aVbut rather, about a box someone needed to check off.
p109
aVOr, I am exceptional,
p110
aVwhich means I've had to leave the people I love behind.
p111
aVIt's the price that I and so many others pay for learning while black.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VI police myself all the time.
p116
aVAre my pants too tight?
p117
aVShould I wear my hair up or in a fro?
p118
aVShould I speak up for myself,
p119
aVor will the power of my words be reduced to: "She's angry"?
p120
aa(lp121
VWhy did I have to leave the Bronx
p122
aVto gain access to a better education?
p123
aVAnd why, in the process of getting that better education,
p124
aVdid I have to endure the trauma of erasing what made me, me \u2014
p125
aVa black girl from the Bronx, raised by an Antiguan mother?
p126
aVSo when I think about our current education reform initiatives,
p127
aVI can't help asking:
p128
aVWhat are our students of color learning about themselves?
p129
aa(lp130
VThree \u2014 three decades of research reveal
p131
aVthat students of color are suspended and expelled
p132
aVat a rate three times greater than white students,
p133
aVand are punished in harsher ways for the same infractions.
p134
aVThey also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives
p135
aVin the curricula.
p136
aVThe Cooperative Children's Book Center did a review of nearly 4,000 books
p137
aVand found that only three percent were about African-Americans.
p138
aVAnd they further learn this
p139
aVthrough the lack of teachers that look like them.
p140
aVAn analysis of data
p141
aVfrom the National Center for Education Statistics
p142
aVfound that 45 percent of our nation's pre-K to high school students
p143
aVwere people of color,
p144
aVwhile only 17 percent of our teachers are.
p145
aa(lp146
VOur youth of color pay a profound price
p147
aVwhen their schooling sends them the message
p148
aVthat they must be controlled,
p149
aVthat they must leave their identities at home
p150
aVin order to be successful.
p151
aVEvery child deserves an education
p152
aVthat guarantees the safety to learn
p153
aVin the comfort of one's own skin.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VIt is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms
p158
aVwhere students also thrive academically.
p159
aVI know, because I did it in my classroom
p160
aVwhen I returned to teach in the Bronx.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo what did that look like?
p163
aVI centered my instruction
p164
aVon the lives, histories and identities of my students.
p165
aVAnd I did all of this because I wanted my students to know
p166
aVthat everyone around them was supporting them
p167
aVto be their best self.
p168
aVSo while I could not control the instability of their homes,
p169
aVthe uncertainty of their next meal,
p170
aVor the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep,
p171
aVI provided them with a loving classroom
p172
aVthat made them feel proud of who they are,
p173
aVthat made them know that they mattered.
p174
aa(lp175
VYou know,
p176
aVevery time I hear or say the word "asking,"
p177
aVI am in high school again.
p178
aVI am thinking about "ass" and "king"
p179
aVand putting the two together so that I speak in a way
p180
aVwhere someone in power will want to listen.
p181
aa(lp182
VThere is a better way,
p183
aVone that doesn't force kids of color into a double bind;
p184
aVa way for them to preserve their ties
p185
aVto their families, homes and communities;
p186
aVa way that teaches them to trust their instincts
p187
aVand to have faith in their own creative genius.
p188
aa(lp189
VThank you.
