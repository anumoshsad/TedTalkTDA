VFour years ago, on the TED stage,
p4
aVI announced a company I was working with at the time
p5
aVcalled Odeo.
p6
aVAnd because of that announcement,
p7
aVwe got a big article in The New York Times,
p8
aVwhich led to more press, which led to more attention,
p9
aVand me deciding to become CEO of that company \u2014
p10
aVwhereas I was just an adviser \u2014
p11
aVand raising a round of venture capital
p12
aVand ramping up hiring.
p13
aa(lp14
VOne of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,
p15
aVand a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,
p16
aVJack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years
p17
aVthat was based around sending simple status updates to friends.
p18
aVWe were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,
p19
aVso we kind of put two and two together,
p20
aVand in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, it's hard to justify doing a side project
p23
aVat a startup, where focus is so critical,
p24
aVbut I had actually launched Blogger as a side project
p25
aVto my previous company,
p26
aVthinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,
p27
aVand it ended up taking over not only the company,
p28
aVbut my life for the next five or six years.
p29
aVSo I learned to follow hunches
p30
aVeven though you can't necessarily justify them
p31
aVor know where they're going to go.
p32
aVAnd that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, for those of you unfamiliar,
p35
aVTwitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.
p36
aVYou say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,
p37
aVand people who are interested in you get those updates.
p38
aVIf they're really interested,
p39
aVthey get the update as a text message on their cell phone.
p40
aVSo, for instance, I may Twitter right now
p41
aVthat I'm giving a talk at TED.
p42
aVAnd in my case, when I hit send,
p43
aVup to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.
p44
aVNow, the fundamental idea is that Twitter
p45
aVlets people share moments of their lives
p46
aVwhenever they want,
p47
aVbe they momentous occasions
p48
aVor mundane ones.
p49
aVIt is by sharing these moments as they're happening
p50
aVthat lets people feel more connected and in touch,
p51
aVdespite distance, and in real time.
p52
aVThis is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,
p53
aVand what got us excited.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhat we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses
p56
aVthat would evolve from this very simple system.
p57
aVOne of the things we realized
p58
aVwas how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
p59
aVWhen the wildfires broke out in San Diego,
p60
aVin October of 2007,
p61
aVpeople turned to Twitter to report what was happening
p62
aVand to find information from neighbors
p63
aVabout what was happening around them.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut it wasn't just individuals.
p66
aVThe L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,
p67
aVand put a Twitter feed on the front page,
p68
aVand the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross
p69
aVused it to dispense news and updates as well.
p70
aVAt this event, dozens of people here are Twittering
p71
aVand thousands of people around the world are following along
p72
aVbecause they want to know what it feels like to be here
p73
aVand what's happening.
p74
aa(lp75
VAmong the other interesting things that have cropped up
p76
aa(lp77
Vare many things from businesses,
p78
aa(lp79
Vfrom marketing and communications and predictable things,
p80
aVto an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck
p81
aVthat drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,
p82
aVcausing a line to form around the block.
p83
aa(lp84
VPoliticians have recently begun Twittering.
p85
aVIn fact, there are 47 members of Congress
p86
aVwho currently have Twitter accounts.
p87
aVAnd they're tweeting, in some cases,
p88
aVfrom behind closed-door sessions with the President.
p89
aVIn this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
p90
aVThe President himself is our most popular Twitter user,
p91
aValthough his tweets have dropped off as of late,
p92
aVwhile Senator McCain's have picked up.
p93
aVAs have this guy's.
p94
aa(lp95
VTwitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:
p96
aVyou send one message and it goes out to everybody,
p97
aVand you receive the messages you're interested in.
p98
aVOne of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter
p99
aVwas by inventing a way to reply to a specific person
p100
aVor a specific message.
p101
aVSo, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here
p102
aVto reply to one of his fans,
p103
aVwas completely invented by users,
p104
aVand we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular
p105
aVand then we made it easier.
p106
aVThis is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnother is via the API.
p109
aVWe built an application-programming interface,
p110
aVwhich basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
p111
aVWe currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software
p112
aVthat can send Twitter updates \u2014
p113
aVinterfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry \u2014
p114
aVas well as things like
p115
aVa device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks
p116
aVor a plant Twitter when it needs water.
p117
aa(lp118
VProbably the most important third-party development
p119
aVcame from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
p120
aVSummize built a Twitter search engine.
p121
aVAnd they tapped into the fact
p122
aVthat, if you have millions of people around the world
p123
aVtalking about what they're doing and what's around them,
p124
aVyou have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event
p125
aVwhile it's going on.
p126
aVThis really changed how we perceived Twitter.
p127
aVFor instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
p128
aVThis is another way that our mind was shifted,
p129
aVand Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
p130
aVWe liked this so much we actually bought the company
p131
aVand are folding it into the main product.
p132
aVThis not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,
p133
aVbut it introduces new use cases as well.
p134
aVOne of my favorites is what happened a few months ago
p135
aVwhen there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
p136
aVSome users figured out
p137
aVthat they would Twitter when they found gas \u2014
p138
aVwhere it was, and how much it cost \u2014
p139
aVand then appended the keyword "#atlgas"
p140
aVwhich let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd this trend of people using this communication network
p143
aVto help each other out
p144
aVgoes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
p145
aVIt's happened more and more lately,
p146
aVwhether it's raising money for homeless people
p147
aVor to dig wells in Africa
p148
aVor for a family in crisis.
p149
aVPeople have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter
p150
aVin a matter of days on several occasions.
p151
aVIt seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,
p152
aVmore good things happen.
p153
aa(lp154
VI have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.
p155
aVI've learned to follow the hunch,
p156
aVbut never assume where it will go.
p157
aVThanks.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VChris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
p162
aVSo, look, if we could have this screen live.
p163
aVThis is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do
p164
aVafter they've been to an event.
p165
aVIt's totally intimidating.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, this would be the Twitter search screen.
p168
aVSo we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.
p169
aVFor example: "Evan Williams."
p170
aV"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."
p171
aV"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams \u2014"
p172
aVOh.
p173
aV"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.
p174
aVWorst talk ever!" (Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VEvan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
p177
aa(lp178
VCA: Just kidding.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,
p181
aVthere are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
p182
aVSo he'll see every aspect of the reaction:
p183
aVthe fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,
p184
aVthe fact that it came out of TED.
p185
aVI don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.
p186
aa(lp187
VYou have build something very fascinating,
p188
aVand it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
p189
aVSo, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.
p190
aVCA: That was very interesting.
