VLet's imagine a sculptor building a statue,
p4
aVjust chipping away with his chisel.
p5
aVMichelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said,
p6
aV"Every block of stone has a statue inside of it,
p7
aVand it's the task of the sculptor to discover it."
p8
aVBut what if he worked in the opposite direction?
p9
aVNot from a solid block of stone,
p10
aVbut from a pile of dust,
p11
aVsomehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue.
p12
aa(lp13
VI know that's an absurd notion.
p14
aVIt's probably impossible.
p15
aVThe only way you get a statue from a pile of dust
p16
aVis if the statue built itself \u2014
p17
aVif somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together
p18
aVto form the statue.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, as odd as that sounds,
p21
aVthat is almost exactly the problem I work on in my lab.
p22
aVI don't build with stone,
p23
aVI build with nanomaterials.
p24
aVThey're these just impossibly small, fascinating little objects.
p25
aVThey're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle,
p26
aVa human hair would be the size of this entire room.
p27
aVAnd they're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology,
p28
aVwhich I'm sure we've all heard about,
p29
aVand we've all heard how it is going to change everything.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen I was a graduate student,
p32
aVit was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology.
p33
aVThere were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time.
p34
aVThe conferences were buzzing,
p35
aVthere was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies.
p36
aVAnd the reason is
p37
aVwhen objects get really small,
p38
aVthey're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects,
p39
aVlike the ones we interact with.
p40
aVWe call this physics quantum mechanics.
p41
aVAnd what it tells you is that you can precisely tune their behavior
p42
aVjust by making seemingly small changes to them,
p43
aVlike adding or removing a handful of atoms,
p44
aVor twisting the material.
p45
aVIt's like this ultimate toolkit.
p46
aVYou really felt empowered; you felt like you could make anything.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd we were doing it \u2014
p49
aVand by we I mean my whole generation of graduate students.
p50
aVWe were trying to make blazing fast computers using nanomaterials.
p51
aVWe were constructing quantum dots
p52
aVthat could one day go in your body and find and fight disease.
p53
aVThere were even groups trying to make an elevator to space
p54
aVusing carbon nanotubes.
p55
aVYou can look that up, that's true.
p56
aVAnyways, we thought it was going to affect
p57
aVall parts of science and technology, from computing to medicine.
p58
aVAnd I have to admit,
p59
aVI drank all of the Kool-Aid.
p60
aVI mean, every last drop.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut that was 15 years ago,
p63
aVand \u2014
p64
aVfantastic science was done, really important work.
p65
aVWe've learned a lot.
p66
aVWe were never able to translate that science into new technologies \u2014
p67
aVinto technologies that could actually impact people.
p68
aVAnd the reason is, these nanomaterials \u2014
p69
aVthey're like a double-edged sword.
p70
aVThe same thing that makes them so interesting \u2014
p71
aVtheir small size \u2014
p72
aValso makes them impossible to work with.
p73
aVIt's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust.
p74
aVAnd we just don't have the tools that are small enough to work with them.
p75
aVBut even if we did, it wouldn't really matter,
p76
aVbecause we couldn't one by one place millions of particles together
p77
aVto build a technology.
p78
aVSo because of that,
p79
aVall of the promise and all of the excitement
p80
aVhas remained just that: promise and excitement.
p81
aVWe don't have any disease-fighting nanobots,
p82
aVthere's no elevators to space,
p83
aVand the thing that I'm most interested in, no new types of computing.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow that last one, that's a really important one.
p86
aVWe just have come to expect
p87
aVthe pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely.
p88
aVWe've built entire economies on this idea.
p89
aVAnd this pace exists
p90
aVbecause of our ability to pack more and more devices
p91
aVonto a computer chip.
p92
aVAnd as those devices get smaller,
p93
aVthey get faster, they consume less power
p94
aVand they get cheaper.
p95
aVAnd it's this convergence that gives us this incredible pace.
p96
aa(lp97
VAs an example:
p98
aVif I took the room-sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back
p99
aVand somehow compressed it \u2014
p100
aVcompressed the world's greatest computer of its day,
p101
aVso it was the same size as your smartphone \u2014
p102
aVyour actual smartphone,
p103
aVthat thing you spent 300 bucks on and just toss out every two years,
p104
aVwould blow this thing away.
p105
aVYou would not be impressed.
p106
aVIt couldn't do anything that your smartphone does.
p107
aVIt would be slow,
p108
aVyou couldn't put any of your stuff on it,
p109
aVyou could possibly get through the first two minutes
p110
aVof a "Walking Dead" episode if you're lucky \u2014
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VThe point is the progress \u2014 it's not gradual.
p115
aVThe progress is relentless.
p116
aVIt's exponential.
p117
aVIt compounds on itself year after year,
p118
aVto the point where if you compare a technology
p119
aVfrom one generation to the next,
p120
aVthey're almost unrecognizable.
p121
aVAnd we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going.
p122
aVWe want to say the same thing 10, 20, 30 years from now:
p123
aVlook what we've done over the last 30 years.
p124
aVYet we know this progress may not last forever.
p125
aVIn fact, the party's kind of winding down.
p126
aVIt's like "last call for alcohol," right?
p127
aVIf you look under the covers,
p128
aVby many metrics like speed and performance,
p129
aVthe progress has already slowed to a halt.
p130
aVSo if we want to keep this party going,
p131
aVwe have to do what we've always been able to do,
p132
aVand that is to innovate.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo our group's role and our group's mission
p135
aVis to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes,
p136
aVbecause we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace.
p137
aVThey are just like they sound.
p138
aVThey're tiny, hollow tubes of carbon atoms,
p139
aVand their nanoscale size, that small size,
p140
aVgives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties.
p141
aVAnd the science tells us if we could employ them in computing,
p142
aVwe could see up to a ten times improvement in performance.
p143
aVIt's like skipping through several technology generations in just one step.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo there we have it.
p146
aVWe have this really important problem
p147
aVand we have what is basically the ideal solution.
p148
aVThe science is screaming at us,
p149
aV"This is what you should be doing to solve your problem."
p150
aVSo, all right, let's get started,
p151
aVlet's do this.
p152
aVBut you just run right back into that double-edged sword.
p153
aVThis "ideal solution" contains a material that's impossible to work with.
p154
aVI'd have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip.
p155
aVIt's that same conundrum, it's like this undying problem.
p156
aa(lp157
VAt this point, we said, "Let's just stop.
p158
aVLet's not go down that same road.
p159
aVLet's just figure out what's missing.
p160
aVWhat are we not dealing with?
p161
aVWhat are we not doing that needs to be done?"
p162
aVIt's like in "The Godfather," right?
p163
aVWhen Fredo betrays his brother Michael,
p164
aVwe all know what needs to be done.
p165
aVFredo's got to go.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut Michael \u2014 he puts it off.
p170
aVFine, I get it.
p171
aVTheir mother's still alive, it would make her upset.
p172
aVWe just said,
p173
aV"What's the Fredo in our problem?"
p174
aVWhat are we not dealing with?
p175
aVWhat are we not doing,
p176
aVbut needs to be done to make this a success?"
p177
aVAnd the answer is that the statue has to build itself.
p178
aVWe have to find a way, somehow,
p179
aVto compel, to convince billions of these particles
p180
aVto assemble themselves into the technology.
p181
aVWe can't do it for them. They have to do it for themselves.
p182
aVAnd it's the hard way, and this is not trivial,
p183
aVbut in this case, it's the only way.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, as it turns out, this is not that alien of a problem.
p186
aVWe just don't build anything this way.
p187
aVPeople don't build anything this way.
p188
aVBut if you look around \u2014 and there's examples everywhere \u2014
p189
aVMother Nature builds everything this way.
p190
aVEverything is built from the bottom up.
p191
aVYou can go to the beach,
p192
aVyou'll find these simple organisms that use proteins \u2014
p193
aVbasically molecules \u2014
p194
aVto template what is essentially sand,
p195
aVjust plucking it from the sea
p196
aVand building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity.
p197
aVAnd nature's not crude like us, just hacking away.
p198
aVShe's elegant and smart,
p199
aVbuilding with what's available, molecule by molecule,
p200
aVmaking structures with a complexity
p201
aVand a diversity that we can't even approach.
p202
aVAnd she's already at the nano.
p203
aVShe's been there for hundreds of millions of years.
p204
aVWe're the ones that are late to the party.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we decided that we're going to use the same tool that nature uses,
p207
aVand that's chemistry.
p208
aVChemistry is the missing tool.
p209
aVAnd chemistry works in this case
p210
aVbecause these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules,
p211
aVso we can use them to steer these objects around,
p212
aVmuch like a tool.
p213
aVThat's exactly what we've done in our lab.
p214
aVWe've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust,
p215
aVinto the pile of nanoparticles,
p216
aVand pulls out exactly the ones we need.
p217
aVThen we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles
p218
aVinto the pattern we need to build circuits.
p219
aVAnd because we can do that,
p220
aVwe can build circuits that are many times faster
p221
aVthan what anyone's been able to make using nanomaterials before.
p222
aVChemistry's the missing tool,
p223
aVand every day our tool gets sharper and gets more precise.
p224
aVAnd eventually \u2014
p225
aVand we hope this is within a handful of years \u2014
p226
aVwe can deliver on one of those original promises.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, computing is just one example.
p229
aVIt's the one that I'm interested in, that my group is really invested in,
p230
aVbut there are others in renewable energy, in medicine,
p231
aVin structural materials,
p232
aVwhere the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano.
p233
aVThat's where the biggest benefit is.
p234
aVBut if we're going to do that,
p235
aVthe scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools \u2014
p236
aVtools just like the ones I described.
p237
aVAnd they will need chemistry. That's the point.
p238
aVThe beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools,
p239
aVthey're out there.
p240
aVThey're out there forever,
p241
aVand anyone anywhere can pick them up and use them,
p242
aVand help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
