VThe immersive ugliness
p4
aVof our everyday environments in America
p5
aVis entropy made visible.
p6
aVWe can't overestimate the amount of despair
p7
aVthat we are generating with places like this.
p8
aVAnd mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better
p9
aVif we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.
p10
aVBy the way, this doesn't help.
p11
aVNobody's having a better day down here because of that.
p12
aa(lp13
VThere are a lot of ways you can describe this.
p14
aVYou know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."
p15
aVYou can call it suburban sprawl.
p16
aVI think it's appropriate to call it
p17
aVthe greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
p18
aVYou can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
p19
aVAnd it's a tremendous problem for us.
p20
aVThe outstanding \u2014 the salient problem about this for us
p21
aVis that these are places that are not worth caring about.
p22
aVWe're going to talk about that some more.
p23
aVA sense of place:
p24
aVyour ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
p25
aVdepends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
p26
aVand to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
p27
aVsyntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
p28
aVin order to inform us who we are.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe public realm in America has two roles:
p31
aVit is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
p32
aVand it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
p33
aVAnd when you degrade the public realm,
p34
aVyou will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
p35
aVand the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
p36
aVThe public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
p37
aVbecause we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
p38
aVand market squares of older cultures.
p39
aVAnd your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
p40
aVall comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
p41
aVThis is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
p42
aVthat we threw in the garbage after World War II
p43
aVand decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.
p44
aVAnd consequently, we can see the result all around us.
p45
aVThe public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
p46
aVbut it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
p47
aVWhere we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
p48
aVby doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going
p49
aVin order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
p50
aVAnd if there is one tremendous \u2014
p51
aVif there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,
p52
aVthe human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
p53
aVit is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.
p56
aVYou know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
p57
aVAnd remember, to create a place of character and quality,
p58
aVyou have to be able to define space.
p59
aVSo how is that being accomplished here?
p60
aVIf you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
p61
aVand try to look at the Target store over here,
p62
aVyou can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
p63
aVThat's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.
p64
aVConsequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
p65
aVThese will be places that are not worth caring about.
p66
aa(lp67
VWe have about, you know, 38,000 places
p68
aVthat are not worth caring about in the United States today.
p69
aVWhen we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.
p70
aVAnd I want you to think about that when you think about
p71
aVthose young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,
p72
aVspilling their blood in the sand,
p73
aVand ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"
p74
aVI hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store
p75
aVbecause that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)
p76
aVWe need better places in this country.
p77
aa(lp78
VPublic space. This is a good public space.
p79
aVIt's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
p80
aVIt is emphatically an outdoor public room.
p81
aVIt has something that is terribly important \u2014
p82
aVit has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
p83
aVThat's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations \u2014
p84
aVthings go in and out of it. It's permeable.
p85
aVThe beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
p86
aVand that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
p87
aVYou know, in these places in other cultures,
p88
aVpeople just go there voluntarily because they like them.
p89
aVWe don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)
p90
aVYou know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.
p91
aVPeople just go because it's pleasurable to be there.
p92
aVBut this is how we do it in the United States.
p93
aa(lp94
VProbably the most significant public space failure in America,
p95
aVdesigned by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:
p96
aVBoston City Hall Plaza.
p97
aVA public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)
p98
aVAnd we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,
p99
aVand every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.
p100
aVAnd every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is the other side of the building.
p103
aVThis was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.
p104
aVIt wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,
p105
aVbut there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.
p106
aVThis is the back of Boston City Hall,
p107
aVthe most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany \u2014 excuse me \u2014 in Boston.
p108
aVAnd what is the message that is coming,
p109
aVwhat are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building
p110
aVand how is it informing us about who we are?
p111
aa(lp112
VThis, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits
p113
aVof Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,
p114
aVand all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,
p115
aVbecause then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
p116
aVYou know, that it's a despotic building;
p117
aVit wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)
p118
aVThis is it on a smaller scale:
p119
aVthe back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.
p120
aVBy the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,
p121
aVthey all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)
p122
aVand they shouted at me and said,
p123
aV"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"
p124
aVBecause this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VYou know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)
p127
aVAudio jack, power supply \u2014
p128
aVand look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?
p129
aVYou know, we hire firms to design these things.
p130
aVYou can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.
p131
aVYou know, eight hours before deadline,
p132
aVfour architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
p133
aVAnd they're sitting there at the long boardroom table
p134
aVwith all the drawings, and the renderings,
p135
aVand all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and \u2014
p136
aVI mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)
p137
aVBecause you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
p138
aVIt was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VThat \u2014 that is the message of this form of architecture.
p141
aVThe message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.
p142
aVSo I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to \u2014
p143
aVyou know \u2014 do some reality testing,
p144
aVand in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)
p145
aVit's not interesting enough for his clients,
p146
aVyou know, the burglars, the muggers.
p147
aVIt's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
p148
aVOK.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe pattern of Main Street USA \u2014
p151
aVin fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
p152
aVIt's not that complicated:
p153
aVbuildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
p154
aVso that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
p155
aVOther activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
p156
aVyou know, apartments, offices, and so on.
p157
aVYou make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
p158
aVThey haven't learned that in Monterey.
p159
aVIf you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
p160
aVyou'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.
p161
aVIt's really incredible.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,
p164
aVand this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
p165
aVwhen we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
p166
aVSo the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
p167
aVOK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
p168
aVwhere the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
p169
aVOf course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
p170
aVThen because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
p171
aVwe pop a handicapped ramp on that,
p172
aVand then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
p173
aVAnd that's how we do it.
p174
aVI call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America
p175
aVthat the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
p176
aVAnd in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
p177
aVNot just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
p178
aVYou know, that's not good enough.
p179
aVWe have to do good buildings.
p180
aa(lp181
VThe street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:
p182
aVTo spatially denote the pedestrian realm,
p183
aVto protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,
p184
aVto filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
p185
aVand to soften the hardscape of the buildings
p186
aVand to create a ceiling \u2014 a vaulted ceiling \u2014 over the street, at its best.
p187
aVAnd that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.
p188
aVThey're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;
p189
aVthey're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."
p190
aa(lp191
VYou know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding
p192
aVof the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
p193
aVThey're not the same thing.
p194
aVAnd we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
p195
aVwhich is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
p196
aVHere you see it on a small scale \u2014 the mothership has landed,
p197
aVR2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch
p198
aVto see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VA lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma
p201
aVthat we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
p202
aVcity life, and everything connected with it.
p203
aVAnd so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
p204
aVis this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
p205
aVwhich is going to be life in the country for everybody.
p206
aVAnd that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
p207
aVthe country villa along the railroad line,
p208
aVwhich allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
p209
aVbut to return to the countryside every night.
p210
aVAnd believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
p211
aVso it really was a form of country living.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years
p214
aVand it turns into something rather insidious.
p215
aVIt becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
p216
aVAnd that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia
p217
aVand one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
p218
aVBecause it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.
p221
aVBasically, a house with nothing on the side
p222
aVbecause this house wants to state, emphatically,
p223
aV"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.
p224
aVI don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see."
p225
aVSo you have this one last facade of the house,
p226
aVthe front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.
p227
aVBecause \u2014 notice the porch here.
p228
aVUnless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.
p229
aVThis is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal."
p230
aVWe're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
p231
aVPlease respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut we know what's going on in these houses, you know.
p234
aVWe know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,
p235
aVgetting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)
p236
aVWe know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,
p237
aVis turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.
p238
aVBecause these places, these habitats,
p239
aVare inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,
p240
aVand they don't have a lot of experience with medication.
p241
aVSo they take the first one that comes along, often.
p242
aVThese are not good enough for Americans.
p243
aVThese are the schools we are sending them to:
p244
aVThe Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.
p245
aVThis is a real school!
p246
aVYou know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,
p247
aVthat they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.
p248
aVSo every effort is made to keep them within the building.
p249
aVNotice that nature is present. (Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VWe're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.
p252
aVWe are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and \u2014 certainly in America
p253
aV\u2014 the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.
p254
aVIt is going to change absolutely everything.
p255
aVChris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,
p256
aVexcept to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.
p257
aVForget it. It's not going to happen.
p258
aVWe're going to have to do something else instead.
p259
aVWe're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size
p260
aVvirtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.
p261
aVWe're going to have \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 we're going to have to live closer to where we work.
p262
aVWe're going to have to live closer to each other.
p263
aVWe're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
p264
aVThe age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.
p265
aVWe're going to have to \u2014 we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!
p266
aVWe gotta do better than that!
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd we should have started two days before yesterday.
p269
aVWe are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,
p270
aVexcavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage
p271
aVby our parents' generation after World War II.
p272
aVBecause we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.
p273
aVWe're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill
p274
aVin order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,
p275
aVthat allow \u2014 that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life
p276
aVand our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo that, you know, the residences make sense
p279
aVdeployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.
p280
aVWe're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:
p281
aVthe street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,
p282
aVthe courtyard, the civic square
p283
aVand how to really make use of this property.
p284
aVWe can see some of the first ideas
p285
aVfor retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
p286
aVThe dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
p287
aVWell, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.
p288
aVThey're not going to be retro-fitted;
p289
aVthey're going to be the salvage yards of the future.
p290
aa(lp291
VSome of them we're going to fix, though.
p292
aVAnd we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems
p293
aVand returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.
p294
aVAnd if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers
p295
aVin our existing towns and cities.
p296
aVAnd by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were
p297
aVbecause they occupy all the important sites.
p298
aVAnd most of them are still going to be there,
p299
aValthough the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe've got a lot of work to do.
p302
aVWe're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
p303
aVNo amount or combination of alternative fuels
p304
aVis going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.
p305
aVWe're going to have to do everything very differently.
p306
aVAnd America's not prepared.
p307
aVWe are sleepwalking into the future.
p308
aVWe're not ready for what's coming at us.
p309
aVSo I urge you all to do what you can.
p310
aVLife in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.
p311
aVBe prepared to be good neighbors.
p312
aVBe prepared to find vocations that make you useful
p313
aVto your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.
p314
aa(lp315
VOne final thing \u2014 I've been very disturbed about this for years,
p316
aVbut I think it's particularly important for this audience.
p317
aVPlease, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?
p318
aVConsumers are different than citizens.
p319
aVConsumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties
p320
aVto their fellow human beings.
p321
aVAnd as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,
p322
aVyou will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.
p323
aVAnd we're going to continue being clueless
p324
aVgoing into this very difficult future that we face.
p325
aVSo thank you very much.
p326
aVPlease go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about
p327
aVand a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)
