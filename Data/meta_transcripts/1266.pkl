VI'd like to start with a short story.
p4
aVIt's about a little boy
p5
aVwhose father was a history buff
p6
aVand who used to take him by the hand
p7
aVto visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis
p8
aVon the outskirts of their camp.
p9
aVThey would always stop by to visit
p10
aVthese huge winged bulls that used to guard
p11
aVthe gates of that ancient metropolis,
p12
aVand the boy used to be scared
p13
aVof these winged bulls,
p14
aVbut at the same time they excited him.
p15
aVAnd the dad used to use those bulls
p16
aVto tell the boy stories about
p17
aVthat civilization and their work.
p18
aa(lp19
VLet's fast-forward to the
p20
aVSan Francisco Bay Area many decades later,
p21
aVwhere I started a technology company
p22
aVthat brought the world its first
p23
aV3D laser scanning system.
p24
aVLet me show you how it works.
p25
aVFemale Voice: Long range laser scanning
p26
aVby sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.
p27
aVThe system measures the beam's time of flight,
p28
aVrecording the time it takes for the light
p29
aVto hit a surface and make its return.
p30
aVWith two mirrors, the scanner calculates
p31
aVthe beam's horizontal and vertical angles,
p32
aVgiving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.
p33
aVThe point is then recorded
p34
aVinto a 3D visualization program.
p35
aVAll of this happens in seconds.
p36
aVBen Kacyra: You can see here,
p37
aVthese systems are extremely fast.
p38
aVThey collect millions of points at a time
p39
aVwith very high accuracy
p40
aVand very high resolution.
p41
aVA surveyor with traditional survey tools
p42
aVwould be hard-pressed to produce
p43
aVmaybe 500 points in a whole day.
p44
aVThese babies would be producing
p45
aVsomething like ten thousand points a second.
p46
aVSo, as you can imagine,
p47
aVthis was a paradigm shift
p48
aVin the survey and construction
p49
aVas well as in reality capture industry.
p50
aa(lp51
VApproximately ten years ago,
p52
aVmy wife and I started a foundation to do good,
p53
aVand right about that time,
p54
aVthe magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,
p55
aVhundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,
p56
aVwere blown up by the Taliban.
p57
aVThey were gone in an instant.
p58
aVAnd unfortunately, there was
p59
aVno detailed documentation of these Buddhas.
p60
aVThis clearly devastated me,
p61
aVand I couldn't help but wonder about
p62
aVthe fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,
p63
aVand the fate of the many, many
p64
aVheritage sites all over the world.
p65
aVBoth my wife and I
p66
aVwere so touched by this
p67
aVthat we decided to
p68
aVexpand the mission of our foundation
p69
aVto include digital heritage preservation
p70
aVof world sites.
p71
aVWe called the project CyArk,
p72
aVwhich stands for Cyber Archive.
p73
aa(lp74
VTo date, with the help of
p75
aVa global network of partners,
p76
aVwe've completed close to fifty projects.
p77
aVLet me show you some of them:
p78
aVChichen Itza,
p79
aVRapa Nui \u2014
p80
aVand what you're seeing here
p81
aVare the cloud of points \u2014
p82
aVBabylon,
p83
aVRosslyn Chapel,
p84
aVPompeii,
p85
aVand our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,
p86
aVwhich happened to be one of
p87
aVour most challenging projects.
p88
aVAs you see here, we had to develop
p89
aVa special rig to bring the scanner
p90
aVup close and personal.
p91
aVThe results of our work in the field
p92
aVare used to produce
p93
aVmedia and deliverables to be used
p94
aVby conservators and researchers.
p95
aVWe also produce media for
p96
aVdissemination to the public \u2014
p97
aVfree through the CyArk website.
p98
aVThese would be used for education,
p99
aVcultural tourism, etc.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhat you're looking at in here
p102
aVis a 3D viewer that we developed
p103
aVthat would allow the display
p104
aVand manipulation of [the] cloud of points
p105
aVin real time, cutting sections through them
p106
aVand extracting dimensions.
p107
aVThis happens to be the cloud of points
p108
aVfor Tikal.
p109
aVIn here you see a traditional 2D
p110
aVarchitectural engineering drawing
p111
aVthat's used for preservation, and of course
p112
aVwe tell the stories through fly-throughs.
p113
aVAnd here, this is a fly-through
p114
aVthe cloud of points of Tikal,
p115
aVand here you see it rendered
p116
aVand photo-textured with the photography
p117
aVthat we take of the site.
p118
aVAnd so this is not a video.
p119
aVThis is actual 3D points with
p120
aVtwo to three millimeter accuracy.
p121
aVAnd of course the data can be used
p122
aVto develop 3D models that are
p123
aVvery accurate and very detailed.
p124
aVAnd here you're looking at a model
p125
aVthat's extracted from the cloud of points
p126
aVfor Stirling Castle.
p127
aVIt's used for studies, for visualization,
p128
aVas well as for education.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd finally, we produce mobile apps
p131
aVthat include narrated virtual tools.
p132
aVThe more I got involved
p133
aVin the heritage field,
p134
aVthe more it became clear to me
p135
aVthat we are losing the sites
p136
aVand the stories faster than we can
p137
aVphysically preserve them.
p138
aVOf course, earthquakes
p139
aVand all the natural phenomena \u2014
p140
aVfloods, tornadoes, etc. \u2014
p141
aVtake their toll.
p142
aVHowever, what occurred to me was
p143
aVhuman-caused destruction, which was
p144
aVnot only causing a significant portion
p145
aVof the destruction, but actually
p146
aVit was accelerating.
p147
aVThis includes arson,
p148
aVurban sprawl,
p149
aVacid rain, not to mention
p150
aVterrorism and wars.
p151
aVIt was getting more and more apparent
p152
aVthat we're fighting a losing battle.
p153
aVWe're losing our sites
p154
aVand the stories,
p155
aVand basically we're losing
p156
aVa piece \u2014 and a significant piece \u2014
p157
aVof our collective memory.
p158
aVImagine us as a human race
p159
aVnot knowing where we came from.
p160
aa(lp161
VLuckily, in the last two or three decades,
p162
aVdigital technologies have been developing
p163
aVthat have helped us to develop tools
p164
aVthat we've brought to bear
p165
aVin the digital preservation,
p166
aVin our digital preservation war.
p167
aVThis includes, for example,
p168
aVthe 3D laser scanning systems,
p169
aVever more powerful personal computers,
p170
aV3D graphics,
p171
aVhigh-definition digital photography,
p172
aVnot to mention the Internet.
p173
aVBecause of this accelerated
p174
aVpace of destruction,
p175
aVit became clear to us that we needed
p176
aVto challenge ourselves and our partners
p177
aVto accelerate our work.
p178
aVAnd we created a project
p179
aVwe call the CyArk 500 Challenge \u2014
p180
aVand that is to digitally preserve
p181
aV500 World Heritage Sites
p182
aVin five years.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe do have the technology
p185
aVthat's scaleable,
p186
aVand our network of global partners
p187
aVhas been expanding and can be expanded
p188
aVat a rapid rate,
p189
aVso we're comfortable
p190
aVthat this task can be accomplished.
p191
aVHowever, to me, the 500 is
p192
aVreally just the first 500.
p193
aVIn order to sustain our work into the future,
p194
aVwe use technology centers
p195
aVwhere we partner with
p196
aVlocal universities and colleges
p197
aVto take the technology to them,
p198
aVwhereby they then can help us
p199
aVwith digital preservation of their heritage sites,
p200
aVand at the same time, it gives them
p201
aVthe technology to benefit from in the future.
p202
aa(lp203
VLet me close with another short story.
p204
aVTwo years ago, we were approached
p205
aVby a partner of ours to digitally preserve
p206
aVan important heritage site,
p207
aVa UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,
p208
aVthe Royal Kasubi Tombs.
p209
aVThe work was done successfully in the field,
p210
aVand the data was archived
p211
aVand publicly disseminated
p212
aVthrough the CyArk website.
p213
aVLast March,
p214
aVwe received very sad news.
p215
aVThe Royal Tombs had been destroyed
p216
aVby suspected arson.
p217
aVA few days later, we received a call:
p218
aV"Is the data available
p219
aVand can it be used for reconstruction?"
p220
aVOur answer, of course, was yes.
p221
aa(lp222
VLet me leave you with a final thought.
p223
aVOur heritage is much more than
p224
aVour collective memory \u2014
p225
aVit's our collective treasure.
p226
aVWe owe it to our children,
p227
aVour grandchildren and the generations
p228
aVwe will never meet
p229
aVto keep it safe
p230
aVand to pass it along.
p231
aVThank you.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aVThank you.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
p237
aa(lp238
VThank you.
p239
aa(lp240
VWell, I'm staying here because
p241
aVwe wanted to demonstrate to you
p242
aVthe power of this technology
p243
aVand so, while I've been speaking,
p244
aVyou have been scanned.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aVThe two wizards that I have
p247
aVthat are behind the curtain
p248
aVwill help me bring
p249
aVthe results on the screen.
p250
aV(Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is all in 3D and of course
p253
aVyou can fly through the cloud of points.
p254
aVYou can look at it from on top,
p255
aVfrom the ceiling.
p256
aVYou can look from different vantage points,
p257
aVbut I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in
p258
aVon an individual in the crowd,
p259
aVjust to show the amount of detail
p260
aVthat we can create.
p261
aVSo you have been digitally preserved
p262
aVin about four minutes.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VI'd like to thank the wizards here.
p266
aVWe were very lucky to have
p267
aVtwo of our partners participate in this:
p268
aVthe Historic Scotland,
p269
aVand the Glasgow School of Art.
p270
aVI'd like to also thank personally
p271
aVthe efforts of David Mitchell,
p272
aVwho is the Director of Conservation
p273
aVat Historic Scotland.
p274
aVDavid.
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVAnd Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of
p277
aVVisualization at the Glasgow School of Art.
p278
aVLet's give them a hand.
p279
aa(lp280
