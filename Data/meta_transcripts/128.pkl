VI'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.
p4
aVProbably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.
p5
aVShortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner
p6
aVwith the family. The conversation turned to global warming,
p7
aVand everybody agreed, there's a real problem.
p8
aVWe've got a climate crisis.
p9
aVSo, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.
p10
aVThe conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.
p11
aVShe said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
p12
aVI'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,
p13
aV"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.
p14
aVAll the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVI didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,
p17
aV"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVAnd we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate
p20
aVthis problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,
p21
aVwe must act, and we must act decisively.
p22
aVI've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,
p25
aVto try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.
p26
aVWe went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,
p27
aVto Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.
p28
aVAnd so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you
p29
aVabout what we've learned in those journeys.
p30
aVBecause the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.
p31
aVYou know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,
p32
aVand so when we see a big problem or an opportunity
p33
aVlike avian flu or personalized medicine,
p34
aVwe just get together the smartest people we know.
p35
aVFor this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,
p36
aVof superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs
p37
aVand business leaders. Fifty or so of them.
p38
aVAnd so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that
p39
aVand four lessons I've learned in the last year.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe first lesson is that companies are really powerful,
p42
aVand that matters a lot. This is a story about
p43
aVhow Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.
p44
aVTwo years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is
p45
aVthe next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.
p46
aVThey committed that they're going to take their existing stores
p47
aVand reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,
p48
aVand their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.
p49
aVThe three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating
p50
aVand air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.
p51
aVSo, look what they did.
p52
aVThey painted the roofs of all their stores white.
p53
aVThey put smart skylights through their stores
p54
aVso they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.
p55
aVAnd, third, they put the refrigerated goods
p56
aVbehind closed doors with LED lighting.
p57
aVI mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?
p58
aVThese are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhy does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.
p61
aVThey're the largest private employer in America.
p62
aVThey're the largest private user of electricity.
p63
aVThey have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.
p64
aVAnd they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,
p65
aV60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,
p66
aVit would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
p67
aVAnd maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhen Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,
p70
aVit has a powerful impact on other great institutions.
p71
aVSo, let me tell you this:
p72
aVwhen Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,
p73
aVthat's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.
p74
aVWe need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,
p77
aVand they matter enormously.
p78
aVI've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?
p79
aVWal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.
p80
aVThat's a third of the U.S. population.
p81
aV65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.
p82
aVAnd Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell
p83
aVanother 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.
p84
aVConsumers don't really like these light bulbs.
p85
aVThe light's kind of funny, they won't dim,
p86
aVtakes a while for them to start up.
p87
aVBut the pay-off is really enormous.
p88
aV100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means
p89
aVthat we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,
p90
aVand 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.
p91
aVIt does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.
p92
aVIt is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic
p93
aVto haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.
p94
aVIt's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles
p95
aVin Fiji and ship it here.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's hard to change consumer behavior
p99
aVbecause consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?
p100
aVDo you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?
p101
aVI don't know, and I should.
p102
aVThose of us who care about all this would act better
p103
aVif we knew what the real costs were.
p104
aVBut as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,
p105
aVas long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?
p106
aVI'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes
p107
aVwe can reasonably expect from individuals
p108
aVare going to be clearly not enough.
p109
aa(lp110
VThe third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.
p111
aVIn fact, policy is paramount.
p112
aVI've got a behind-the-scenes story for you
p113
aVabout that green tech network I described.
p114
aVAt the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about
p115
aVwhat the action items would be, how we'd follow up.
p116
aVAnd Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.
p117
aVYou know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.
p118
aVWell, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now
p119
aVis to make it clear in Sacramento, California
p120
aVthat we need a market-based system of mandates
p121
aVthat's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
p122
aVIt's necessary and, just as important,
p123
aVit's good for the California economy.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met
p126
aVwith the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
p127
aVYou know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,
p128
aVso it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.
p129
aV(Applause)
p130
aVPlease. Thank you.
p131
aVI think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?
p132
aVBecause California was the first state in this country
p133
aVto mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.
p134
aVAnd the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,
p135
aVfour billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions
p136
aVby 174 million tons a year.
p137
aVCalifornia emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.
p138
aVIt's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,
p139
aVbut I've got to tell you \u2014 where I started \u2014 I'm really afraid.
p140
aVIn fact, I'm certain California's not enough.
p141
aa(lp142
VHere's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.
p143
aVYou know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?
p144
aVWell, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.
p145
aVHe's the father of the ethanol revolution.
p146
aVHe told us that Brazil's government mandated
p147
aVthat every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.
p148
aVAnd they mandated that their new vehicles
p149
aVwould be flex-fuel compatible, right?
p150
aVThey'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.
p151
aVAnd so, here's what's happened in Brazil.
p152
aVThey now have 29,000 ethanol pumps \u2014
p153
aVthis versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California \u2014
p154
aVand in three years their new car fleet
p155
aVhas gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.
p156
aVCompare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.
p157
aVAnd you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.
p158
aVSo, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced
p159
aV40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.
p160
aVThat's 59 billion dollars since 1975
p161
aVthat they didn't ship to the Middle East.
p162
aVIt's created a million jobs inside that country,
p163
aVand it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.
p164
aVThat's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.
p165
aVBut Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.
p166
aVSo, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.
p167
aVIn fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have
p168
aVare not going to be enough.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe fourth and final lesson we've learned
p171
aVis about the potential of radical innovation.
p172
aVSo, I want to tell you about a tragic problem
p173
aVand a breakthrough technology.
p174
aVEvery year a million and a half people die of
p175
aVa completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.
p176
aVAll for want of two dollars' worth of medications
p177
aVthat we can buy at the corner drugstore.
p178
aVWell, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.
p179
aVSo, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars
p180
aVfrom the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way
p181
aVto make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,
p182
aVand they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.
p183
aVAnd in doing so, they'll save a million lives \u2014
p184
aVat least a million lives a year. A million lives.
p185
aVTheir breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.
p186
aVThis leverages millions of years of evolution
p187
aVby redesigning bugs to make really useful products.
p188
aVNow, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,
p189
aVyou change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, you may ask,
p192
aVJohn, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?
p193
aVWell, I'll tell you \u2014 a lot.
p194
aVWe've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology
p195
aVthat they're using can be used to make better biofuels.
p196
aVDon't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.
p197
aVThat means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
p198
aVand optimize them along the way.
p199
aVSo, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats
p200
aVthat are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.
p201
aVI guess that's better living through bugs.
p202
aVAlan Kay is famous for saying
p203
aVthe best way to predict the future is to invent it.
p204
aVAnd, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say
p205
aVthe second best way is to finance it.
p206
aVAnd that's why we're investing 200 million dollars
p207
aVin a wide range of really disruptive new technologies
p208
aVfor innovation in green technologies.
p209
aVAnd we're encouraging others to do it as well.
p210
aVWe're talking a lot about this.
p211
aa(lp212
VIn 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies
p213
aVof the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
p214
aVBut I'm really afraid we need much, much more.
p215
aVFor reference, fact one:
p216
aVExxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.
p217
aVDo you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D?
p218
aVSecond fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy
p219
aVis barely a billion dollars in total.
p220
aVLess than one day of Exxon's revenues.
p221
aVThird fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy
p222
aVin hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs
p223
aVfor the next thousand years. And the federal budget
p224
aVcalls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy.
p225
aVIt is almost criminal that we are not investing more
p226
aVin energy research in this country.
p227
aVAnd I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.
p230
aVWho would have thought that a mass retailer
p231
aVcould make money by going green? Who would have thought that
p232
aVa database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?
p233
aVWho would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle
p234
aVwould come from a developing country in South America?
p235
aVAnd who would have thought that scientists
p236
aVtrying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?
p237
aVAnd who would have thought that all that is not enough?
p238
aVNot enough to stabilize the climate.
p239
aVNot enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.
p240
aVThe scientists tell us \u2014 and they're only guessing \u2014
p241
aVthat we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,
p242
aVand do it as fast as possible.
p243
aVNow, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,
p244
aVbut I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,
p245
aVand so somehow we're going to have to find the political will
p246
aVto do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.
p247
aa(lp248
VTo size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;
p249
aVthe U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means
p250
aVwe'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.
p251
aVThat's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.
p252
aVAnd if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.
p253
aVWhen I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed
p254
aVabout their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,
p255
aV"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."
p256
aVThen he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth
p257
aVso that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"
p258
aVDoes anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.
p259
aVWe've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations
p260
aVmake the right outcome, the profitable outcome,
p261
aVand therefore the likely outcome.
p262
aVEnergy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.
p263
aVIt is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?
p264
aa(lp265
VWell, I'll tell you what. Green technologies \u2014 going green \u2014
p266
aVis bigger than the Internet.
p267
aVIt could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
p268
aVMoreover, if we succeed, it's going to be
p269
aVthe most important transformation for life on the planet since,
p270
aVas Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.
p271
aVNow, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's
p272
aVcompanies and individuals and policies and innovation
p273
aVis not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.
p274
aVEveryone here cares about changing the world
p275
aVand has made a difference in that one way or another.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo, our call to action \u2014 my call to you \u2014
p278
aVis for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.
p279
aVWhat can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.
p280
aVGo to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com
p281
aVand buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,
p282
aVlobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.
p283
aVThere's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd the most important thing you can do, I think,
p286
aVis to use your personal power and your Rolodex
p287
aVto lead your business, your institution, in going green.
p288
aVDo it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green
p289
aVfor its customers and its suppliers and for itself.
p290
aVReally think outside the box.
p291
aVCan you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google
p292
aVor Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?
p293
aVIt could be bigger than Wal-Mart.
p294
aVI can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.
p295
aVAnd I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,
p296
aVall of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.
p297
aVBecause if we do, I can look forward
p298
aVto the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.
