VRoger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.
p4
aVThis is Alex, the best computer voice
p5
aVI've been able to find,
p6
aVwhich comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.
p7
aVFor most of my life,
p8
aVI never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
p9
aVIt was like breathing.
p10
aVIn those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.
p11
aVAfter surgeries for cancer
p12
aVtook away my ability to speak, eat or drink,
p13
aVI was forced to enter this virtual world
p14
aVin which a computer does some of my living for me.
p15
aa(lp16
VFor several days now,
p17
aVwe have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.
p18
aVI used to be able to talk like that.
p19
aVMaybe I wasn't as smart,
p20
aVbut I was at least as talkative.
p21
aVI want to devote my talk today
p22
aVto the act of speaking itself,
p23
aVand how the act of speaking or not speaking
p24
aVis tied so indelibly to one's identity
p25
aVas to force the birth of a new person
p26
aVwhen it is taken away.
p27
aVHowever, I've found that listening to a computer voice
p28
aVfor any great length of time
p29
aVcan be monotonous.
p30
aVSo I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends
p31
aVto read my words aloud for me.
p32
aVI will start with my wife, Chaz.
p33
aa(lp34
VChaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side
p35
aVthrough three attempts to reconstruct my jaw
p36
aVand restore my ability to speak.
p37
aVGoing into the first surgery
p38
aVfor a recurrence of salivary cancer
p39
aVin 2006,
p40
aVI expected to be out of the hospital
p41
aVin time to return to my movie review show,
p42
aV'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.'
p43
aVI had pre-taped enough shows
p44
aVto get me through six weeks of surgery
p45
aVand recuperation.
p46
aVThe doctors took a fibula bone from my leg
p47
aVand some tissue from my shoulder
p48
aVto fashion into a new jaw.
p49
aVMy tongue, larynx and vocal cords
p50
aVwere still healthy and unaffected.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VCE: I was optimistic,
p57
aVand all was right with the world.
p58
aVThe first surgery was a great success.
p59
aVI saw myself in the mirror
p60
aVand I looked pretty good.
p61
aVTwo weeks later, I was ready to return home.
p62
aVI was using my iPod
p63
aVto play the Leonard Cohen song
p64
aV'I'm Your Man'
p65
aVfor my doctors and nurses.
p66
aVSuddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.
p67
aVMy carotid artery had ruptured.
p68
aVThank God I was still in my hospital room
p69
aVand my doctors were right there.
p70
aVChaz told me
p71
aVthat if that song hadn't played for so long,
p72
aVI might have already been in the car, on the way home,
p73
aVand would have died right there and then.
p74
aVSo thank you, Leonard Cohen,
p75
aVfor saving my life.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VThere was a second surgery \u2014
p80
aVwhich held up for five or six days
p81
aVand then it also fell apart.
p82
aVAnd then a third attempt,
p83
aVwhich also patched me back together pretty well,
p84
aVuntil it failed.
p85
aVA doctor from Brazil said
p86
aVhe had never seen anyone survive
p87
aVa carotid artery rupture.
p88
aVAnd before I left the hospital,
p89
aVafter a year of being hospitalized,
p90
aVI had seven ruptures
p91
aVof my carotid artery.
p92
aa(lp93
VThere was no particular day
p94
aVwhen anyone told me
p95
aVI would never speak again;
p96
aVit just sort of became obvious.
p97
aVHuman speech
p98
aVis an ingenious manipulation of our breath
p99
aVwithin the sound chamber of our mouth
p100
aVand respiratory system.
p101
aVWe need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath
p102
aVin order to form sounds.
p103
aVTherefore, the system
p104
aVmust be essentially airtight
p105
aVin order to capture air.
p106
aVBecause I had lost my jaw,
p107
aVI could no longer form a seal,
p108
aVand therefore my tongue
p109
aVand all of my other vocal equipment
p110
aVwas rendered powerless.
p111
aa(lp112
VDean Ornish: At first for a long time,
p113
aVI wrote messages in notebooks.
p114
aVThen I tried typing words on my laptop
p115
aVand using its built in voice.
p116
aVThis was faster,
p117
aVand nobody had to try to read my handwriting.
p118
aVI tried out various computer voices that were available online,
p119
aVand for several months I had a British accent,
p120
aVwhich Chaz called Sir Lawrence."
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aV"It was the clearest I could find.
p123
aVThen Apple released the Alex voice,
p124
aVwhich was the best I'd heard.
p125
aVIt knew things like the difference
p126
aVbetween an exclamation point and a question mark.
p127
aVWhen it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence
p128
aVsound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
p129
aVThere are all sorts of html codes you can use
p130
aVto control the timing and inflection of computer voices,
p131
aVand I've experimented with them.
p132
aVFor me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.
p133
aVWhen I find myself in a conversational situation,
p134
aVI need to type fast and to jump right in.
p135
aVPeople don't have the time or the patience
p136
aVto wait for me to fool around with the codes
p137
aVfor every word or phrase.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
p140
aVHow does that affect who you are as a person?
p141
aVWhen people hear Alex speaking my words,
p142
aVdo they experience a disconnect?
p143
aVDoes that create a separation or a distance
p144
aVfrom one person to the next?
p145
aVHow did I feel not being able to speak?
p146
aVI felt, and I still feel,
p147
aVa lot of distance from the human mainstream.
p148
aVI've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.
p149
aVEven then, I'm aware that most people have little patience
p150
aVfor my speaking difficulties.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice
p153
aVusing my TV show voice
p154
aVfrom a period of 30 years.
p155
aVAt first I was against it.
p156
aVI thought it would be creepy
p157
aVto hear my own voice coming from a computer.
p158
aVThere was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.
p159
aVBut I decided then to just give it a try.
p160
aVSo we contacted a company in Scotland
p161
aVthat created personalized computer voices.
p162
aVThey'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.
p163
aVAll of their voices had been made by a speaker
p164
aVrecording original words in a control booth.
p165
aVBut they were willing to give it a try.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,
p168
aVincluding several audio commentary tracks
p169
aVthat I'd made for movies on DVDs.
p170
aVAnd it sounded like me, it really did.
p171
aVThere was a reason for that; it was me.
p172
aVBut it wasn't that simple.
p173
aVThe tapes from my TV show weren't very useful
p174
aVbecause there were too many other kinds of audio involved \u2014
p175
aVmovie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me \u2014
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVand my words often had a particular emphasis
p178
aVthat didn't fit into a sentence well enough.
p179
aa(lp180
VI'll let you hear a sample of that voice.
p181
aVThese are a few of the comments I recorded for use
p182
aVwhen Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.
p183
aVAnd here's the voice we call Roger Jr.
p184
aVor Roger 2.0.
p185
aa(lp186
VRoger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is
p187
aVto be back on your show.
p188
aVWe have been talking for a long time,
p189
aVand now here we are again.
p190
aVThis is the first version of my computer voice.
p191
aVIt still needs improvement,
p192
aVbut at least it sounds like me
p193
aVand not like HAL 9000.
p194
aVWhen I heard it the first time,
p195
aVit sent chills down my spine.
p196
aVWhen I type anything,
p197
aVthis voice will speak whatever I type.
p198
aVWhen I read something, it will read in my voice.
p199
aVI have typed these words in advance,
p200
aVas I didn't think it would be thrilling
p201
aVto sit here watching me typing.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe voice was created by a company in Scotland
p204
aVnamed CereProc.
p205
aVIt makes me feel good
p206
aVthat many of the words you are hearing were first spoken
p207
aVwhile I was commenting on "Casablanca"
p208
aVand "Citizen Kane."
p209
aVThis is the first voice they've created for an individual.
p210
aVThere are several very good voices available for computers,
p211
aVbut they all sound like somebody else,
p212
aVwhile this voice sounds like me.
p213
aVI plan to use it on television, radio
p214
aVand the Internet.
p215
aVPeople who need a voice should know
p216
aVthat most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.
p217
aVMany blind people use them
p218
aVto read pages on the Web to themselves.
p219
aVBut I've got to say, in first grade,
p220
aVthey said I talked too much,
p221
aVand now I still can.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VRoger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,
p226
aVbut the words jump up and down.
p227
aVThe flow isn't natural.
p228
aVThe good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,
p229
aVand I'm optimistic about it.
p230
aVBut so far, the Apple Alex voice
p231
aVis the best one I've heard.
p232
aVI wrote a blog about it
p233
aVand actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.
p234
aVHe said he recorded many long hours in various intonations
p235
aVto be used in the voice.
p236
aVA very large sample is needed.
p237
aa(lp238
VJohn Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.
p239
aVNow I have spoken my last words,
p240
aVand I don't even remember for sure
p241
aVwhat they were.
p242
aVI feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story
p243
aVtitled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."
p244
aVOn Wednesday, David Christian explained to us
p245
aVwhat a tiny instant the human race represents
p246
aVin the time-span of the universe.
p247
aVFor almost all of its millions and billions of years,
p248
aVthere was no life on Earth at all.
p249
aVFor almost all the years of life on Earth,
p250
aVthere was no intelligent life.
p251
aVOnly after we learned to pass knowledge
p252
aVfrom one generation to the next,
p253
aVdid civilization become possible.
p254
aVIn cosmological terms,
p255
aVthat was about 10 minutes ago.
p256
aVFinally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,
p257
aVthe computer.
p258
aVThat has mostly happened in my lifetime.
p259
aa(lp260
VSome of the famous early computers
p261
aVwere being built in my hometown of Urbana,
p262
aVthe birthplace of HAL 9000.
p263
aVWhen I heard the amazing talk
p264
aVby Salman Khan on Wednesday,
p265
aVabout the Khan Academy website
p266
aVthat teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,
p267
aVI had a flashback.
p268
aVIt was about 1960.
p269
aVAs a local newspaper reporter still in high school,
p270
aVI was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois
p271
aVto interview the creators
p272
aVof something called PLATO.
p273
aVThe initials stood for Programmed Logic
p274
aVfor Automated Teaching Operations.
p275
aVThis was a computer-assisted instruction system,
p276
aVwhich in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.
p277
aVThe programmers said it could assist students in their learning.
p278
aa(lp279
VI doubt, on that day 50 years ago,
p280
aVthey even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.
p281
aVBut that's not the point.
p282
aVThe point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,
p283
aVan instant in time.
p284
aVIt continued to evolve and operated in one form or another
p285
aVon more and more sophisticated computers,
p286
aVuntil only five years ago.
p287
aVI have learned from Wikipedia
p288
aVthat, starting with that humble beginning,
p289
aVPLATO established forums, message boards,
p290
aVonline testing,
p291
aVemail, chat rooms,
p292
aVpicture languages, instant messaging,
p293
aVremote screen sharing
p294
aVand multiple-player games.
p295
aa(lp296
VSince the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,
p297
aVit appears that my hometown
p298
aVin downstate Illinois
p299
aVwas the birthplace
p300
aVof much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.
p301
aVBut I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aVI'm here as a man who wants to communicate.
p304
aa(lp305
VAll of this has happened in my lifetime.
p306
aVI started writing on a computer back in the 1970s
p307
aVwhen one of the first Atech systems was installed
p308
aVat the Chicago Sun-Times.
p309
aVI was in line at Radio Shack
p310
aVto buy one of the first Model 100's.
p311
aVAnd when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards
p312
aVthat they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,
p313
aVthey didn't know what I was talking about.
p314
aVWhen I bought my first desktop,
p315
aVit was a DEC Rainbow.
p316
aVDoes anybody remember that?"
p317
aV(Applause)
p318
aV"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival
p319
aVwith a portable computer the size of a suitcase
p320
aVnamed the Porteram Telebubble.
p321
aVI joined CompuServe
p322
aVwhen it had fewer numbers
p323
aVthan I currently have followers on Twitter.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VCE: All of this has happened
p328
aVin the blink of an eye.
p329
aVIt is unimaginable
p330
aVwhat will happen next.
p331
aVIt makes me incredibly fortunate
p332
aVto live at this moment in history.
p333
aVIndeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,
p334
aVbecause without intelligence and memory
p335
aVthere is no history.
p336
aVFor billions of years,
p337
aVthe universe evolved
p338
aVcompletely without notice.
p339
aVNow we live in the age of the Internet,
p340
aVwhich seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.
p341
aVAnd because of it,
p342
aVI can communicate
p343
aVas well as I ever could.
p344
aVWe are born into a box
p345
aVof time and space.
p346
aVWe use words and communication
p347
aVto break out of it
p348
aVand to reach out to others.
p349
aa(lp350
VFor me, the Internet began
p351
aVas a useful tool
p352
aVand now has become something I rely on
p353
aVfor my actual daily existence.
p354
aVI cannot speak;
p355
aVI can only type so fast.
p356
aVComputer voices
p357
aVare sometimes not very sophisticated,
p358
aVbut with my computer,
p359
aVI can communicate more widely
p360
aVthan ever before.
p361
aVI feel as if my blog,
p362
aVmy email, Twitter and Facebook
p363
aVhave given me a substitute
p364
aVfor everyday conversation.
p365
aVThey aren't an improvement,
p366
aVbut they're the best I can do.
p367
aVThey give me a way to speak.
p368
aVNot everybody has the patience
p369
aVof my wife, Chaz.
p370
aVBut online,
p371
aVeverybody speaks at the same speed.
p372
aa(lp373
VThis whole adventure
p374
aVhas been a learning experience.
p375
aVEvery time there was a surgery that failed,
p376
aVI was left with a little less flesh and bone.
p377
aVNow I have no jaw left at all.
p378
aVWhile harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,
p379
aVthe surgeries left me with back pain
p380
aVand reduced my ability to walk easily.
p381
aVIronic that my legs are fine,
p382
aVand it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.
p383
aVWhen you see me today,
p384
aVI look like the Phantom of the Opera.
p385
aa(lp386
VBut no you don't.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
V(Applause)
p391
aa(lp392
VIt is human nature to look at someone like me
p393
aVand assume I have lost some of my marbles.
p394
aVPeople \u2014
p395
aV(Applause)
p396
aVPeople talk loudly \u2014
p397
aa(lp398
VI'm so sorry.
p399
aVExcuse me.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Applause)
p402
aa(lp403
VPeople talk loudly and slowly to me.
p404
aVSometimes they assume I am deaf.
p405
aVThere are people who don't want to make eye contact.
p406
aa(lp407
VBelieve me, he didn't mean this as \u2014
p408
aVanyway, let me just read it.
p409
aV(Laughter)
p410
aVYou should never let your wife read something like this.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VIt is human nature
p415
aVto look away from illness.
p416
aVWe don't enjoy a reminder
p417
aVof our own fragile mortality.
p418
aVThat's why writing on the Internet
p419
aVhas become a lifesaver for me.
p420
aVMy ability to think and write
p421
aVhave not been affected.
p422
aVAnd on the Web, my real voice finds expression.
p423
aVI have also met many other disabled people
p424
aVwho communicate this way.
p425
aVOne of my Twitter friends
p426
aVcan type only with his toes.
p427
aVOne of the funniest blogs on the Web
p428
aVis written by a friend of mine
p429
aVnamed Smartass Cripple.
p430
aV(Laughter)
p431
aVGoogle him and he will make you laugh.
p432
aVAll of these people are saying, in one way or another,
p433
aVthat what you see
p434
aVis not all you get.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo I have not come here to complain.
p437
aVI have much to make me happy and relieved.
p438
aVI seem, for the time being,
p439
aVto be cancer-free.
p440
aVI am writing as well as ever.
p441
aVI am productive.
p442
aVIf I were in this condition at any point
p443
aVbefore a few cosmological instants ago,
p444
aVI would be as isolated as a hermit.
p445
aVI would be trapped inside my head.
p446
aVBecause of the rush of human knowledge,
p447
aVbecause of the digital revolution,
p448
aVI have a voice,
p449
aVand I do not need to scream.
p450
aa(lp451
VRE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.
p452
aVA guy goes into a psychiatrist.
p453
aVThe psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."
p454
aVThe guy says, "I want a second opinion."
p455
aVThe psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly."
p456
aa(lp457
V(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VYou all know the test for artificial intelligence \u2014 the Turing test.
p460
aVA human judge has a conversation
p461
aVwith a human and a computer.
p462
aVIf the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,
p463
aVthe machine has passed the test.
p464
aVI now propose a test for computer voices \u2014 the Ebert test.
p465
aVIf a computer voice can successfully tell a joke
p466
aVand do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,
p467
aVthen that's the voice I want.
