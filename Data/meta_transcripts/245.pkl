VSo, as researchers, something that we often do is use immense resources
p4
aVto achieve certain capabilities, or achieve certain goals.
p5
aVAnd this is essential to the progress of science,
p6
aVor exploration of what is possible.
p7
aVBut it creates this unfortunate situation
p8
aVwhere a tiny, tiny fraction of the world
p9
aVcan actually participate in this exploration
p10
aVor can benefit from that technology.
p11
aVSomething that motivates me,
p12
aVand gets me really excited about my research,
p13
aVis when I see simple opportunities
p14
aVto drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible
p15
aVto a much wider percentage of the population.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention
p18
aVthat I think embody this philosophy.
p19
aVAnd they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote.
p20
aVFor those of you who aren't familiar with this device,
p21
aVit's a $40 video game controller.
p22
aVAnd it's mostly advertised for its motion-sensing capabilities:
p23
aVso you can swing a tennis racket, or hit a baseball bat.
p24
aVBut what actually interests me a lot more
p25
aVis the fact that in the tip of each controller
p26
aVis a relatively high-performing infrared camera.
p27
aVAnd I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo here, I have my computer set up with the projector,
p30
aVand I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it.
p31
aVAnd, for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money,
p32
aVprobably a lot of schools,
p33
aVor if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard,
p34
aVnormally these cost about two to three thousand dollars.
p35
aVSo I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote.
p36
aVNow, this requires another piece of hardware,
p37
aVwhich is this infrared pen.
p38
aVYou can probably make this yourself for about five dollars
p39
aVwith a quick trip to the Radio Shack.
p40
aVIt's got a battery, a button and an infrared LED \u2014
p41
aVyou guys can't see it \u2014
p42
aVbut it turns on whenever I push the button.
p43
aVNow, what this means is that if I run this piece of software,
p44
aVthe camera sees the infrared dot,
p45
aVand I can register the location of the camera pixels
p46
aVto the projector pixels.
p47
aVAnd now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo for about $50 of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard.
p52
aVThis is Adobe Photoshop.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VThank you.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VThe software for this I've actually put on my website
p61
aVand have let people download it for free.
p62
aVIn the three months this project has been public,
p63
aVit's been downloaded over half a million times.
p64
aVSo teachers and students all around the world
p65
aVare already using this.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Applause)
p68
aa(lp69
VAlthough it does do it for 50 dollars,
p70
aVthere are some limitations of this approach.
p71
aVYou get about 80 percent of the way there, for one percent of the cost.
p72
aVAnother nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots,
p73
aVso this is actually a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Applause)
p76
aa(lp77
VFor the second demo,
p78
aVI have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV.
p79
aVSo it's pointing away from the display, rather than pointing at the display.
p80
aVAnd why this is interesting
p81
aVis that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses,
p82
aVthat have two infrared dots in them,
p83
aVthey are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location.
p84
aVAnd why this is interesting
p85
aVis I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor,
p86
aVwhich has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it.
p87
aVAnd you can see that it looks like a 3D room.
p88
aVkind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D,
p89
aVbut for the most part, the image looks pretty flat,
p90
aVand bound to the surface of the screen.
p91
aVBut if we turn on head tracking \u2014
p92
aVthe computer can change the image that's on the screen
p93
aVand make it respond to the head movements.
p94
aVSo let's switch back to that.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo this has actually been a little bit startling
p101
aVto the game-development community.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VBecause this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware
p106
aVif you already have a Nintendo Wii.
p107
aVSo I'm looking forward to seeing some games,
p108
aVand actually Louis Castle, that's him down there,
p109
aVlast week announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers,
p110
aVis releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature
p111
aVfor supporting this type of head tracking.
p112
aVAnd that's from less than five months
p113
aVfrom a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VBut actually, to me, what's almost more interesting
p122
aVthan either of these two projects
p123
aVis how people actually found out about them.
p124
aVYouTube has really changed the way, or changed the speed,
p125
aVin which a single individual
p126
aVcan actually spread an idea around the world.
p127
aVI'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera,
p128
aVand within the first week, a million people had seen this work,
p129
aVand literally within days, engineers, teachers and students
p130
aVfrom around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos
p131
aVof them using my system or derivatives of this work.
p132
aVSo I hope to see more of that in the future,
p133
aVand hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo thank you very much.
