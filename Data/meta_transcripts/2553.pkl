VWhat do you do if you had to figure out the information
p4
aVbehind 11.5 million documents,
p5
aVverify it and make sense of it?
p6
aVThat was a challenge
p7
aVthat a group of journalists had to face late last year.
p8
aVAn anonymous person calling himself John Doe
p9
aVhad somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records
p10
aVof the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
p11
aVThis is one of many firms around the world
p12
aVthat specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens
p13
aVlike the British Virgin Islands,
p14
aVfor rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets.
p15
aa(lp16
VJohn Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm,
p17
aVevery client file,
p18
aVevery email,
p19
aVfrom 1977 to the present day.
p20
aVIt represented the biggest cache
p21
aVof inside information into the tax haven system
p22
aVthat anyone had ever seen.
p23
aVBut it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism.
p24
aVThink about it: 11.5 million documents,
p25
aVcontaining the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries.
p26
aVWhere do you start with such a vast resource?
p27
aVWhere do you even begin to tell a story
p28
aVthat can trail off into every corner of the globe,
p29
aVand that can affect almost any person in any language,
p30
aVsometimes in ways they don't even know yet.
p31
aa(lp32
VJohn Doe had given the information to two journalists
p33
aVat the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
p34
aVHe said he was motivated by \u2014 and I quote \u2014
p35
aV"The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."
p36
aVBut one user alone can never make sense
p37
aVof such a vast amount of information.
p38
aVSo the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out
p39
aVto my organization in Washington, DC,
p40
aVThe International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
p41
aVWe decided to do something that was the very opposite
p42
aVof everything we'd been taught to do as journalists:
p43
aVshare.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBy nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves.
p48
aVWe fiercely guard our secrets,
p49
aVat times even from our editors,
p50
aVbecause we know that the moment we tell them what we have,
p51
aVthey'll want that story right away.
p52
aVAnd to be frank,
p53
aVwhen you get a good story,
p54
aVyou like to keep the glory to yourself.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world,
p57
aVand that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this.
p58
aVThe issues we report on are more and more transnational.
p59
aVGiant corporations operate on a global level.
p60
aVEnvironmental and health crises are global.
p61
aVSo, too, are financial flows and financial crises.
p62
aVSo it seems staggering that journalism has been so late
p63
aVto cover stories in a truly global way.
p64
aVAnd it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow
p65
aVto wake up to the possibilities that technology brings,
p66
aVrather than being frightened of it.
p67
aVThe reason journalists are scared of technology is this:
p68
aVthe profession's largest institutions are going through tough times
p69
aVbecause of the changing way that people are consuming news.
p70
aVThe advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken.
p71
aVAnd this has plunged journalism into crisis,
p72
aVforcing those institutions to reexamine how they function.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut where there is crisis,
p75
aVthere is also opportunity.
p76
aVThe first challenge presented
p77
aVby what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers
p78
aVwas to make the documents searchable and readable.
p79
aVThere were nearly five million emails,
p80
aVtwo million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed,
p81
aVand millions more files and other kinds of documents.
p82
aVThey all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location
p83
aVin the cloud.
p84
aVWe next invited reporters to have a look at the documents.
p85
aVIn all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations
p86
aVin 76 countries \u2014
p87
aVfrom the BBC in Britain
p88
aVto Le Monde newspaper in France
p89
aVto the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.
p90
aV"Native eyes on native names," we called it, the idea being,
p91
aVwho best to tell you who was important to Nigeria
p92
aVthan a Nigerian journalist?
p93
aVWho best in Canada than a Canadian?
p94
aVThere were only two rules for everyone who was invited:
p95
aVwe all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else,
p96
aVand we all agreed to publish together on the same day.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe chose our media partners based on trust
p99
aVthat had been built up through previous smaller collaborations
p100
aVand also from leads that jumped out from the documents.
p101
aVOver the next few months,
p102
aVmy small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people
p103
aVwas joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups.
p104
aVThe biggest information leak in history
p105
aVhad now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history:
p106
aV376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do,
p107
aVworking shoulder to shoulder,
p108
aVsharing information,
p109
aVbut telling no one.
p110
aVFor it became clear at this point
p111
aVthat in order to make the biggest kind of noise,
p112
aVwe first needed the biggest kind of silence.
p113
aa(lp114
VTo manage the project over the many months it would take,
p115
aVwe built a secure virtual newsroom.
p116
aVWe used encrypted communication systems,
p117
aVand we built a specially designed search engine.
p118
aVInside the virtual newsroom,
p119
aVthe reporters could gather around the themes
p120
aVthat were emerging from the documents.
p121
aVThose interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance,
p122
aVcould share information about how the offshore world was being used
p123
aVto hide the trade in both of those commodities.
p124
aVThose interested in sport could share information
p125
aVabout how famous sports stars were putting their image rights
p126
aVinto offshore companies,
p127
aVthereby likely avoiding taxes
p128
aVin the countries where they plied their trade.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut perhaps most exciting of all
p131
aVwere the number of world leaders and elect politicians
p132
aVthat were emerging from the documents \u2014
p133
aVfigures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,
p134
aVclose associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia
p135
aVand the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked
p136
aVthrough his late father, Ian Cameron.
p137
aa(lp138
VBuried in the documents were secret offshore entities,
p139
aVsuch as Wintris Inc.,
p140
aVa company in the British Virgin Islands
p141
aVthat had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.
p142
aVI like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,
p143
aVthe Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project,
p144
aVas the loneliest man in the world.
p145
aVFor nine months, he refused paid work
p146
aVand lived off the earnings of his wife.
p147
aVHe pasted tarps over the windows of his home
p148
aVto prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter.
p149
aVAnd he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences,
p150
aVas he worked red-eyed,
p151
aVnight after night,
p152
aVmonth after month.
p153
aVIn all that time, he sat on information
p154
aVthat would eventually bring down the leader of his country.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery,
p157
aVsuch as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company,
p158
aVthat that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks \u2014
p159
aVthe very issue he's been elected on \u2014
p160
aVwell, your instinct is to scream out very loud.
p161
aVInstead, as one of the few people that he could speak to,
p162
aVJohannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor.
p163
aV"Wintris is coming," he used to say.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VWe were big fans of "Game of Thrones."
p170
aa(lp171
VWhen reporters like Johannes wanted to scream,
p172
aVthey did so inside the virtual newsroom,
p173
aVand then they turned those screams into stories
p174
aVby going outside the documents to court records,
p175
aVofficial company registers,
p176
aVand by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name.
p177
aVPanama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world
p178
aVthrough a different lens from everybody else.
p179
aa(lp180
VAs we were researching the story,
p181
aVunconnected to us,
p182
aVa major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil.
p183
aVA new leader was elected in Argentina.
p184
aVThe FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,
p185
aVthe organization that controls the world of professional soccer.
p186
aVThe Panama Papers actually had unique insights
p187
aVinto each one of these unfolding events.
p188
aVSo you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas
p189
aVthat could have ruined what we were trying to do.
p190
aVAny of one of these journalists,
p191
aVthey could have broken the pact.
p192
aVBut they didn't.
p193
aVAnd on April 3 this year,
p194
aVat exactly 8pm German time,
p195
aVwe published simultaneously in 76 countries.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VThe Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year.
p200
aVThis is the scene in Iceland the day after we published.
p201
aVIt was the first of many protests.
p202
aVThe Icelandic prime minister had to resign.
p203
aVIt was a first of many resignations.
p204
aVWe spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi,
p205
aVthe most famous soccer player in the world.
p206
aVAnd there were some unintended consequences.
p207
aVThese alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested
p208
aVafter we published details about their hideout.
p209
aVThey'd been using the address
p210
aVto register their offshore company.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThere's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do.
p215
aVThe technology \u2014 the Internet \u2014 that has broken the business model
p216
aVis allowing us to reinvent journalism itself.
p217
aVAnd this dynamic is producing
p218
aVunprecedented levels of transparency and impact.
p219
aVWe showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world
p220
aVby applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques
p221
aVto vast amounts of leaked information.
p222
aVWe put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe.
p223
aVAnd by sharing resources,
p224
aVwe were able to dig deep \u2014
p225
aVmuch deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days,
p226
aVbecause of financial concerns.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, it was a big risk,
p229
aVand it wouldn't work for every story,
p230
aVbut we showed with the Panama Papers
p231
aVthat you can write about any country from just about anywhere,
p232
aVand then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work.
p233
aVTry obtaining a court injunction
p234
aVthat would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries.
p235
aVTry stopping the inevitable.
p236
aa(lp237
VShortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes:
p238
aV"Wintris has arrived."
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VIt had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VBruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.
p249
aa(lp250
VI guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists
p251
aVwho worked with you, right?
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, a couple of questions I would like to ask.
p254
aVThe first one is,
p255
aVyou'd been working in secrecy for over a year
p256
aVwith 350-something colleagues from all over the world \u2014
p257
aVwas there ever a moment when you thought
p258
aVthat the leak may be leaked,
p259
aVthat the collaboration may just be broken
p260
aVby somebody publishing a story?
p261
aVOr somebody not in the group releasing some information
p262
aVthat they got to know?
p263
aa(lp264
VGerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way,
p265
aVincluding when something major was happening in the world,
p266
aVthe journalists from that country wanted to publish right away.
p267
aVWe had to calm them down.
p268
aVProbably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication.
p269
aVWe'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin,
p270
aVbut instead of responding,
p271
aVthe Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us,
p272
aVand denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
p273
aVAt that point, Putin thought it was just about him.
p274
aVAnd, of course, a lot of editors around the world
p275
aVwere very nervous about this.
p276
aVThey thought the story was going to get out.
p277
aVYou can imagine the amount of time they'd spent,
p278
aVthe amount of resources, money spent on this.
p279
aVSo I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down,
p280
aVa bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back:
p281
aV"Calm, remain calm."
p282
aVAnd then eventually, of course, they all did.
p283
aa(lp284
VBG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,
p285
aVyou released a lot of the documents as an open database
p286
aVfor everybody to search via keyword, essentially.
p287
aa(lp288
VGR: We very much believe
p289
aVthat the basic information about the offshore world
p290
aVshould be made public.
p291
aVNow, we didn't publish the underlying documents
p292
aVof the journalists we're working with.
p293
aVBut the basic information such as the name of a person,
p294
aVwhat their offshore company was and the name of that company,
p295
aVis now all available online.
p296
aVIn fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now
p297
aa(lp298
VBG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.
p299
aa(lp300
VGR: Thank you.
