VMy work focuses on the connection of
p4
aVboth thinking about our community life
p5
aVbeing part of the environment
p6
aVwhere architecture grows from the natural
p7
aVlocal conditions and traditions.
p8
aa(lp9
VToday I brought two recent projects
p10
aVas an example of this.
p11
aVBoth projects are in emerging countries,
p12
aVone in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
p13
aVAnd also they have in common
p14
aVthat the different analyses from different perspectives
p15
aVbecomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe first example started with an invitation
p18
aVto design a multistory shopping mall
p19
aVin Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
p20
aVAnd this is the type of building
p21
aVwe were shown as an example, to my team and myself,
p22
aVof what we had to design.
p23
aVAt first, the first thing I thought was,
p24
aVI want to run away.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAfter seeing a few of these buildings \u2014
p29
aVthere are many in the city \u2014
p30
aVwe realized that they have three very big points.
p31
aVFirst, these buildings, they are almost empty
p32
aVbecause they have very large shops
p33
aVwhere people cannot afford to buy things.
p34
aVSecond, they need tons of energy to perform
p35
aVbecause of the skin treatment with glass
p36
aVthat creates heat in the inside,
p37
aVand then you need a lot of cooling.
p38
aVIn a city where this shouldn't happen
p39
aVbecause they have really mild weather
p40
aVthat ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
p41
aVAnd third is that their image has nothing to do
p42
aVwith Africa and with Ethiopia.
p43
aVIt is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
p44
aa(lp45
VAlso during our first visit to Ethiopia,
p46
aVI was really captivated by the old merkato
p47
aVthat is this open-air structure
p48
aVwhere thousands of people, they go and buy things
p49
aVevery day from small vendors.
p50
aVAnd also it has this idea of the public space
p51
aVthat uses the outdoors to create activity.
p52
aVSo I thought, this is what I really want to design,
p53
aVnot a shopping mall.
p54
aVBut the question was how we could do a multistory,
p55
aVcontemporary building with these principles.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe next challenge was when we looked at the site,
p58
aVthat is, in a really growing area of the city,
p59
aVwhere most of these buildings that you see in the image,
p60
aVthey were not there.
p61
aVAnd it's also between two parallel streets
p62
aVthat don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo the first thing we did was to create a connection
p65
aVbetween these two streets,
p66
aVputting all the entrances of the building.
p67
aVAnd this extends with an inclined atrium
p68
aVthat creates an open-air space in the building
p69
aVthat self-protects itself with its own shape
p70
aVfrom the sun and the rain.
p71
aVAnd around this void
p72
aVwe placed this idea of the market with small shops,
p73
aVthat change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
p74
aa(lp75
VI also thought, how to close the building?
p76
aVAnd I really wanted to find a solution
p77
aVthat would respond to the local climate conditions.
p78
aVAnd I started thinking about the textile
p79
aVlike a shell made of concrete
p80
aVwith perforations that would let the air in,
p81
aVand also the light, but in a filtered way.
p82
aVAnd then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
p83
aVThat they have fractal geometry properties
p84
aVand this helped me to shape the whole facade.
p85
aVAnd we are building that
p86
aVwith these small prefabricated pieces
p87
aVthat are the windows that let the air and the light
p88
aVin a controlled way inside the building.
p89
aVAnd this is complemented by these small colored glasses
p90
aVthat use the light from the inside of the building
p91
aVto light up the building at night.
p92
aa(lp93
VWith these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers
p94
aVbecause they were like,
p95
aV"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
p96
aVBut then we all realized that this idea of the market
p97
aVhappened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall
p98
aVbecause basically they had more shops to sell.
p99
aVAnd also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,
p100
aVnot only because of the material compared with the glass,
p101
aVbut also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
p102
aVSo we created some budget savings
p103
aVthat we used to implement the project.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd the first implementation was to think
p106
aVabout how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy
p107
aVin a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
p108
aVSo we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
p109
aVAnd then under those panels
p110
aVwe thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars
p111
aVthat would create this urban oasis.
p112
aVAnd these porches on the roof,
p113
aVall together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
p114
aVHopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe second example is a master plan
p117
aVof 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
p118
aVAnd for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,
p119
aVI really needed to understand the city of Tunis,
p120
aVbut also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
p121
aa(lp122
VDuring that analysis I paid special attention to the medina
p123
aVthat is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,
p124
aVopened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
p125
aVWhen I went to the site, the first design operation we did
p126
aVwas to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks
p127
aVsimilar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona
p128
aVand other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
p129
aVOn top of that, we selected some strategic points
p130
aVreminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,
p131
aVand this modified this initial pattern.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd the last operation was to think about the cell,
p134
aVthe small cell of the project, like the apartment,
p135
aVas an essential part of the master plan.
p136
aVAnd for that I thought, what would be the best orientation
p137
aVin the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
p138
aVAnd it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house
p139
aVand then a natural ventilation.
p140
aVSo we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments
p141
aVare perfectly oriented in that direction.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd this is the result
p144
aVthat is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
p145
aVIt has these blocks with courtyards,
p146
aVand then on the ground floor
p147
aVyou have all these connections for the pedestrians.
p148
aVAnd also it responds to the local regulations that establish
p149
aVa higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
p150
aVAnd it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe volume has this connecting shape
p153
aVthat shades itself with three different types of apartments
p154
aVand also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood
p155
aVAnd in the courtyards there are the different facilities,
p156
aVsuch as a gym and a kindergarten
p157
aVand close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.
p158
aVThe roof, which is my favorite space of the project
p159
aVis almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
p160
aVAnd it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,
p161
aVand do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,
p162
aVjumping from one building to another.
p163
aa(lp164
VThese two examples,
p165
aVthey have a common approach in the design process.
p166
aVAnd also, they are in emerging countries where you can see
p167
aVthe cities literally growing.
p168
aVIn these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow
p169
aVchanges the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
p170
aVFor this reason, I see even more importance
p171
aVto look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions
p172
aVthat enhance the relationship between the community and the environment
p173
aVand that aim to connect nature and people.
