VSixty-five million years ago, a very important
p4
aVand catastrophic event
p5
aVchanged the course of life on land.
p6
aVAnd although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about
p7
aVare just the scum of the Earth on the land \u2014
p8
aVthe little bits of land floating around \u2014 but they are important to us
p9
aVbecause they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.
p10
aVAnd these animals disappeared,
p11
aVand a separate life, mammals,
p12
aVradiated out to take their place. And so, we know this
p13
aVin extraordinary detail. And so this is a core
p14
aVfrom near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,
p15
aVand the things that we've experienced
p16
aVin the entire record of humankind history
p17
aVcan't really quite get around the kind of disaster
p18
aVthat this represented for the Earth.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo even before that impact was known,
p21
aVeven before scientists in general came to an agreement
p22
aVover the theory of evolution,
p23
aVscientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes
p24
aVactually had divided Earth's life's history
p25
aVinto these two episodes:
p26
aVMesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.
p27
aVAnd as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely
p28
aVwith geologic history.
p29
aVSo we have a Mesozoic period,
p30
aVan age of fragmentation,
p31
aVand a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection \u2014
p32
aVSouth America to North America, India to Asia.
p33
aVAnd so my work, really, is trying to understand
p34
aVthe character of that Mesozoic radiation
p35
aVcompared to the Cenozoic radiation
p36
aVto see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals
p37
aVabout what life on drifting continents
p38
aVreally can tell us about evolution.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe work immediately begs the question,
p41
aV"Why didn't they go into the waters?"
p42
aVI mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.
p43
aVYou can go outside \u2014 see many other examples.
p44
aVWithin five, 10 million years of the bolide impact
p45
aVwe had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?
p46
aVWhy didn't they hang around in trees at good size,
p47
aVand why didn't they burrow?
p48
aVWhy didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,
p49
aVwhat kinds of animals were in those spaces?
p50
aVAnd if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us
p51
aVabout, you know, how evolution works on land?
p52
aVReally interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
p53
aVIn fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size \u2014
p54
aVthe size you are when you inherit
p55
aVa vacant ecospace
p56
aVfrom whatever natural disaster.
p57
aa(lp58
VLooking at dinosaur evolution
p59
aVand studying it, digging it up for many years,
p60
aVI end up looking at the mammal radiation,
p61
aVand it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,
p62
aVadvancing by an order of magnitude.
p63
aVDinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,
p64
aVan order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
p65
aVYou want to measure it by diversity?
p66
aVYou want to measure it by
p67
aVthe time it took to reach maximum body size?
p68
aVYes, they do have larger body size,
p69
aVbut many of them are smaller,
p70
aVbut we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.
p71
aVFifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.
p72
aVAnd that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals
p73
aVto achieve maximum body size
p74
aVand invade all those habitats.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo there's lessons to learn,
p77
aVand there's lessons to learn from the exception,
p78
aVthe exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,
p79
aVand many other scholars have made around the world.
p80
aVThis slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.
p81
aVWe now know this transition is the one time
p82
aVthat dinosaurs actually went below
p83
aVthat body size \u2014
p84
aVwe're going to see where they began in a minute \u2014
p85
aVand it is the one time that they rapidly
p86
aVinvaded all the habitats
p87
aVI just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.
p88
aVThey became marine. We now know them today
p89
aVfrom the ice caps.
p90
aVThere's burrowing birds.
p91
aVThey inhabit the trees at all body sizes,
p92
aVand, of course, they inhabit the land.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series
p95
aVthat later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
p96
aVWe called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,
p97
aVand if you go to different layers, you find things
p98
aVthat are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,
p99
aVso that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs \u2014
p100
aVor, more appropriately, feathers \u2014 as to decide whether it's actually
p101
aVa non-avian or an avian.
p102
aVIt is the greatest transition that we have, actually,
p103
aVon land from one habitat to another,
p104
aVbar none,
p105
aVto understand how a bony,
p106
aVfairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal
p107
aVcould make such a transition.
p108
aVIt is really our greatest \u2014 one of our greatest \u2014 evolutionary sequences.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, my work began at the beginning.
p111
aVI thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,
p112
aVI'd have to go back to those beds
p113
aVwhere they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place
p114
aVwhere the earliest dinosaurs existed.
p115
aVI'd like to call for this little video clip
p116
aVto give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:
p117
aV"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"
p118
aVIf we could roll that first video clip.
p119
aVThis is sort of a nice helicopter ride
p120
aVthrough those early beds,
p121
aVand they're located in Northeastern Argentina.
p122
aVAnd we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,
p123
aVdinosaurs had basically taken over.
p124
aVAt the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.
p125
aVThat's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.
p126
aa(lp127
VYou go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,
p128
aVyou get a topographic map,
p129
aVand the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.
p130
aVAnd the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.
p131
aVYou've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that
p132
aVto get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs
p133
aVand find, really, everything that existed \u2014
p134
aVnot just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,
p135
aVand you dig a place like that,
p136
aVyou actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.
p137
aV228 million years old, we found
p138
aVwhat really is the most primitive dinosaur:
p139
aVthat's the Ur-dinosaur.
p140
aVA three-and-a-half foot thing,
p141
aVbeautiful skull, predator,
p142
aVmeat-eater, a two-legged animal.
p143
aVSo, all the other dinosaurs that you know,
p144
aVor your kids know, at least, on four legs.
p145
aVThis is sort of a look at the skull,
p146
aVand it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
p147
aVIt looks rather bird-like because it is.
p148
aVIt's bird-like and hollow.
p149
aVA predator. Maybe 25 pounds,
p150
aVor 10 kilograms.
p151
aVThat's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.
p152
aVThat is 10 times larger
p153
aVthan the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.
p154
aVWe are extremely dinosaur-like,
p155
aVand unusual in our two-legged approach to life.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, if you want to understand what happened
p158
aVthen when the continents broke apart,
p159
aVand dinosaurs found \u2014 landlubbers, as they are \u2014
p160
aVfound themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.
p161
aVMost of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,
p162
aVbecause it was those continents that are least explored.
p163
aVIf you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,
p164
aVyou really have to force yourself to go down
p165
aVto the four corners of the Earth \u2014
p166
aVAfrica, India, Antarctica, Australia \u2014
p167
aVand start putting together some of these pieces.
p168
aVI've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,
p169
aVin the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.
p170
aVBut one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,
p171
aVwith lots of little areas of dinosaur rock
p172
aVif you could survive an expedition.
p173
aa(lp174
VThere's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.
p175
aVTo be able to excavate
p176
aVthe 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara
p177
aVand take them out, you really have to put together
p178
aVan expedition team that can handle the conditions.
p179
aVSome of them are political. Many of them are physical.
p180
aVSome of them \u2014 the most important \u2014 are mental.
p181
aVAnd you really have to be able to withstand conditions \u2014
p182
aVyou have to drive into the desert,
p183
aVyou will see landscapes in many cases \u2014
p184
aVyou can see from what we've discovered \u2014
p185
aVthat nobody else has ever seen.
p186
aVAnd the kinds of teams they bring in?
p187
aVWell, they're
p188
aVcomposed of
p189
aVpeople who understand science as adventure with a purpose.
p190
aVThey're usually students who've never seen a desert.
p191
aVSome of them are more experienced.
p192
aa(lp193
VYour job as a leader \u2014 this is definitely a team sport \u2014
p194
aVyour job as a leader is to try to inspire them
p195
aVto do more work than they've ever done in their life
p196
aVunder conditions that they can't imagine.
p197
aVSo, 125 degrees is normal.
p198
aVThe ground surface at 150 \u2014 typical.
p199
aVSo, you can't leave your normal metal tools out
p200
aVbecause you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.
p201
aVSo, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.
p202
aVYou're really rubbing shoulders
p203
aVwith the world's last great nomadic people.
p204
aVThese are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives
p205
aVmuch as they have for centuries.
p206
aVYour job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,
p207
aVand make them enter the pages of history.
p208
aVTo do that, you've got to actually transport them
p209
aVthousands of miles out of the desert.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger \u2014
p212
aVor Niger, in our English language \u2014 north of Nigeria \u2014
p213
aVthat's where this photograph was taken.
p214
aVBasically you're talking about a country that,
p215
aVwhen we started working there, did not have container traffic.
p216
aVYou transported the bones out yourself
p217
aVto the coast of Africa,
p218
aVonto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.
p219
aVThat's a 2,000 mile journey.
p220
aVSo enormous excavations and a lot of work,
p221
aVand out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs
p222
aVthat you saw buried there \u2014 20 tons of material \u2014
p223
aVwe erect Jobaria,
p224
aVa sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.
p225
aVIt really is a little bit out of place temporally.
p226
aVIt looks nothing like what we would find
p227
aVif we dug in contemporary beds in North America.
p228
aVHere's the animal that was causing it trouble.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd, you know, on and on \u2014
p231
aVa whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this \u2014
p232
aVand some of you have had the chance to touch it \u2014
p233
aVthis is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.
p234
aVThis is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.
p235
aVIt is an incredible view of life,
p236
aVand it really began when we began to understand
p237
aVthe depth of time.
p238
aVIt's only been with us for less than a century,
p239
aVand in that time, that fourth dimension,
p240
aVwhen radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,
p241
aVand we could actually tell how old some of these things were,
p242
aVis probably the most profound transformation,
p243
aVbecause it changes the way we look at ourselves
p244
aVand the world dramatically.
p245
aVWhen you pick up a piece of history like that,
p246
aVI think it can transform
p247
aVkids that are possibly interested in science.
p248
aa(lp249
VThat's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.
p250
aVHere's some others.
p251
aVThis is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.
p252
aVWe prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.
p253
aVIt turns out to have a forebrain
p254
aVone-fifteenth the size of a human.
p255
aVThis was the cover of Science, because they thought
p256
aVthat humans were more intelligent than these animals,
p257
aVbut we can see by some in our administration
p258
aVthat despite
p259
aVthe enormous advantage in brain volume
p260
aVsome of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,
p261
aVsmaller raptors.
p262
aVAll the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of \u2014
p263
aVall those small animals \u2014
p264
aVthey all come from northern continents.
p265
aVThis is the first skeleton from a southern continent,
p266
aVand guess what? You start preparing it.
p267
aVIt has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.
p268
aVIt's really a wholly separate radiation.
p269
aVSo what we're trying to piece together here is a story.
p270
aVIt involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur
p271
aVthat we reconstructed from Africa.
p272
aa(lp273
VCrocodiles, of course,
p274
aVand that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.
p275
aVAnd huge things \u2014 I mean, this is a
p276
aVlower jaw just laying there in the desert
p277
aVof this enormous crocodile.
p278
aVThe crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.
p279
aVThat's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.
p280
aVWe had to try and reconstruct this.
p281
aVWe had to actually look at recent crocodiles
p282
aVto understand how crocodiles scale.
p283
aVCould I have the second little video clip?
p284
aVNow, this field is just \u2014 and, of course, science in general \u2014 is just \u2014 adventure.
p285
aVWe had to find and measure
p286
aVthe largest crocodiles living today.
p287
aa(lp288
VNarrator: ... as long as their boat.
p289
aa(lp290
VMan: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.
p291
aa(lp292
VNarrator: If they can just land it,
p293
aVthis croc will provide useful data,
p294
aVhelping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.
p295
aa(lp296
VMan: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.
p297
aa(lp298
VNarrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.
p299
aa(lp300
VMan: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.
p301
aa(lp302
VMan: I got the back legs.
p303
aa(lp304
VMan 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.
p305
aVI've got it. I've got the back legs.
p306
aVSomebody get the front legs.
p307
aa(lp308
VPaul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.
p309
aVWow.
p310
aVSixty-five. Wow.
p311
aVThat's a big skull.
p312
aa(lp313
VNarrator: Big, but less than half the size
p314
aVof supercroc's skull.
p315
aa(lp316
VMan: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.
p317
aa(lp318
VMan: I knew it was big.
p319
aa(lp320
VPS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.
p321
aa(lp322
VNarrator: Paul has his data, so they decide
p323
aVto release the animal back into the river.
p324
aa(lp325
VPS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!
p326
aa(lp327
VNarrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.
p328
aa(lp329
VPS: Okay, when I say three, we move.
p330
aVOne, two, three!
p331
aVWhoa!
p332
aa(lp333
VSo \u2014 there were \u2014
p334
aV(Applause)
p335
aVWell, you know, the \u2014 the fossil record is truly amazing
p336
aVbecause it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.
p337
aVWe proved with those measurements
p338
aVthat crocodiles scaled isometrically.
p339
aVIt depended on the shape of their skull, though,
p340
aVso we had to actually get those measurements
p341
aVto be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world
p342
aVthat supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.
p343
aVAnyway, you find other things, too.
p344
aVI'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara
p345
aVto dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.
p346
aVWe found this last year.
p347
aVTwo hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.
p348
aa(lp349
VThis is a ceremonial disk.
p350
aVAn amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara
p351
aV5,000 years ago is been sitting out there
p352
aVwaiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.
p353
aVAnd then work later is going to take us to Tibet.
p354
aVNow, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.
p355
aVIt's really an island continent.
p356
aVIt was a precursor to India,
p357
aVa messenger from Gondwana \u2014
p358
aVa lost paradise of dinosaurs
p359
aVisolated for millions of years.
p360
aVNo one's found them. We know where they are,
p361
aVand we're going to go and get them next year.
p362
aVThey're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,
p363
aVbut if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.
p364
aVNow, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history
p365
aVso that we can try to understand
p366
aVsome basic patterns of evolution.
p367
aVI've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.
p368
aVWe need to delve into this mass of anatomy
p369
aVthat we've been compiling
p370
aVto understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.
p371
aVWe can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,
p372
aVbut we can learn some of the rules of the game,
p373
aVand that's really what we're trying to do.
p374
aa(lp375
VWith regard to the biogeographic question,
p376
aVthe Earth is dividing.
p377
aVThese are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.
p378
aVYou get divided, and a continent's division
p379
aVcorresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,
p380
aVor you're crafty, and you manage to escape
p381
aVfrom one to the other and erase that division,
p382
aVor you're living peacefully on each side,
p383
aVand on one side you just go extinct,
p384
aVand you survive on the other side and create a difference.
p385
aVAnd the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other
p386
aVof those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.
p387
aVAnd you take those four instances
p388
aVand you realize you have a complex problem.
p389
aVAnd so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers
p390
aVfrom the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated \u2014
p391
aVwe call it dispersal \u2014 around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.
p392
aVThey did it within two or three degrees of the pole,
p393
aVto maintain similarity between continents.
p394
aVBut when they were divided, indeed they were divided,
p395
aVand we do see the continents
p396
aVcarving differences among dinosaurs.
p397
aa(lp398
VBut there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.
p399
aVWe have downgraded this factor.
p400
aVIt carves up the history of life,
p401
aVand gives us the differences that we see
p402
aVin the dinosaur world towards the end,
p403
aVright before the bolide impact.
p404
aVThe best way to test this is to actually create a model.
p405
aVSo if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.
p406
aVI want to give you three dimensions.
p407
aVSo you see the tree of life,
p408
aVbut now I've added the dimension of area.
p409
aVSo the tree of life is normally divergence over time.
p410
aVNow we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.
p411
aa(lp412
VThis is a computer program
p413
aVwhich has three knobs.
p414
aVWe can control those things that we're worried about:
p415
aVextinction, sampling, dispersal \u2014
p416
aVgoing from one area to another.
p417
aVAnd ultimately we can control the branching
p418
aVto mimic what we think the continents were like,
p419
aVand run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,
p420
aVto answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,
p421
aVat least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.
p422
aa(lp423
VToday I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here
p424
aVtalking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,
p425
aVwhich is related to the fact that I never \u2014
p426
aVand actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,
p427
aVthere's a number of you out there \u2014 I don't know that I'd get an answer
p428
aVhonestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,
p429
aVbut there are a number of you out there that started your
p430
aVscientific, technical, entertainment career
p431
aVas failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.
p432
aVI was one of those. I was failed by my school \u2014 my school failed me.
p433
aVWho's pointing fingers?
p434
aVSeveral teachers nearly killed me.
p435
aVI found myself in art.
p436
aVI was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.
p437
aVAnd I went on \u2014 that's my first painting on canvas.
p438
aVI read a dictionary. I got into college.
p439
aVI became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.
p440
aVIt became abstract.
p441
aVI worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.
p442
aVSometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.
p443
aVSomething was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.
p444
aVI took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.
p445
aa(lp446
VBut really it's the same discipline \u2014 they're kindred disciplines.
p447
aVI mean, is there anything
p448
aVthat is not visualizing what can't be seen,
p449
aVin terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it
p450
aVthat's out there, or seeing the distortion
p451
aVthat we try to see
p452
aVas evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?
p453
aVThis is a very extraordinarily visual.
p454
aVI give you a human face because you're experts at that.
p455
aVIt takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.
p456
aVThey're really kindred disciplines.
p457
aVBut what we're trying to create in Chicago
p458
aVis a way to get,
p459
aVcollect together, those students
p460
aVwho are least represented in our science and technology spheres.
p461
aVWe all know, and there's been several allusions to it,
p462
aVthat we are failing in our ability to produce
p463
aVenough scientists, engineers and technicians.
p464
aa(lp465
VWe've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,
p466
aVand now, as you see the increase
p467
aVin the pace of what we're doing,
p468
aVit becomes even more prominent.  Where are all these people going to come from?
p469
aVAnd a more general question for our society is,
p470
aVwhat's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?
p471
aVWhat about all the kids like me that were in school \u2014
p472
aVkids like some of you out there \u2014
p473
aVthat were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance
p474
aVto participate in science and technology?
p475
aa(lp476
VThose are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.
p477
aVNiger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately
p478
aVto do something in Niger.
p479
aVThey have an AIDS problem. I asked \u2014
p480
aVthe U.S. State Department asked the government recently,
p481
aVWhat do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.
p482
aVDinosaurs was one of them.
p483
aVGive us a museum of dinosaurs,
p484
aVand we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.
p485
aVAnd I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,
p486
aVor somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.
p487
aVBut when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,
p488
aVthe cities where most of you come from \u2014 certainly the city I come from \u2014
p489
aVthere's legions of kids out there
p490
aVlike these.
p491
aVAnd the question is \u2014 and we started to address this question for centuries \u2014
p492
aVas to how we get these kids involved in science.
p493
aa(lp494
VWe've started in Chicago
p495
aVan organization \u2014 a non-profit organization \u2014
p496
aVcalled Project Exploration.
p497
aVThese are two kids from Project Exploration.
p498
aVWe met them in their early stages in high school. They were \u2014
p499
aVfailing to poor students,
p500
aVand they are now \u2014 one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.
p501
aVWe've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.
p502
aVAnd we created a track record.
p503
aVBecause when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,
p504
aVtrack records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.
p505
aVSo, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,
p506
aV90 percent going to college, many first-generation,
p507
aV90 percent of those choosing science as a career.
p508
aVIt's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,
p509
aVwell, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,
p510
aVbut when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.
p511
aa(lp512
VIt's gone through science as an inquiry,
p513
aVwhich was a big advance,
p514
aVand Dewey back at Chicago \u2014
p515
aVyou learn by doing.
p516
aVTo \u2014 you learn by envisioning yourself
p517
aVas a scientist,
p518
aVand then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.
p519
aVThe next step is to learn the capability
p520
aVto make yourself a scientist.
p521
aVYou have to have those steps. If you have \u2014
p522
aVIt's easy to get kids interested in science.
p523
aVIt's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,
p524
aVwhich involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium
p525
aVand presenting something as a knowledgeable person,
p526
aVand then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist
p527
aVand giving yourself the tools to pursue that.
p528
aa(lp529
VAnd so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.
p530
aVWe have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing \u2014
p531
aVand I've talked to some people here at TED \u2014
p532
aVit's not going to look like anything you've seen before.
p533
aVIt's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,
p534
aVpart-conservatory, part-zoo,
p535
aVand part of an answer to the problem
p536
aVof how you interest kids in science.
p537
aVThank you very much.
