VCities are like siblings in a large polygamous family.
p4
aVEach one has a unique personality and is headed in a distinct direction.
p5
aVBut they all have somewhat shared origins.
p6
aVSometimes I think postcolonial cities are like the children
p7
aVof the two least-favorite wives,
p8
aVwho are constantly being asked,
p9
aV"Ah, why can't you be more like your sister?"
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VThe "why" of cities is largely the same, no matter where they are:
p14
aVan advantageous location that makes trade and administration possible;
p15
aVthe potential for scalable opportunities
p16
aVfor the skilled and unskilled alike;
p17
aVa popular willingness to be in constant flux
p18
aVand, of course, resilience.
p19
aVThe "how" of cities, however, is a whole other story.
p20
aVHow are they run?
p21
aVHow do they grow?
p22
aVHow do they decide who belongs and who doesn't?
p23
aa(lp24
VLagos is my home.
p25
aVYou can always find the Nigerians
p26
aVby following the noise and the dancing, right?
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VLike any major city, that place is a lot of things,
p31
aVmany of which are highly contradictory.
p32
aVOur public transportation doesn't quite work,
p33
aVso we have these privately owned bright yellow buses
p34
aVthat regularly cause accidents.
p35
aVLuxury car showrooms line badly maintained and often flooded roads.
p36
aVStreet evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous
p37
aVthan street harassment.
p38
aVSex workers sometimes have two degrees, a bank job
p39
aVand a prominent role in church.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VOn any given day,
p44
aVthere can be either a party or a burned body
p45
aVin the middle of a street.
p46
aa(lp47
VThere is so much that is possible in Lagos
p48
aVand so much that isn't,
p49
aVand very often the difference between possibility and impossibility
p50
aVis simply who you are,
p51
aVand if you're lucky enough, who you're connected to.
p52
aVBelonging in Lagos is a fluid concept
p53
aVdetermined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender,
p54
aVbut most visibly and often most violently,
p55
aVclass.
p56
aa(lp57
VBefore Nigeria became a country,
p58
aVfisherpeople from the inland creeks started to come down the Lagos lagoon
p59
aVand establish villages along the coast.
p60
aVAbout 60 years later, my grandfather, Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,
p61
aValso arrived in Lagos.
p62
aVLike me, he was an alumnus of the University of Ibadan,
p63
aVa young member of the educated elite in the independence era.
p64
aVOver time, he built an illustrious career as a land surveyor,
p65
aVmapping out now-bustling neighborhoods
p66
aVwhen they were just waist-high wild grass.
p67
aVHe died when I was nine.
p68
aVAnd by that time, my family, like the families of those fisherpeople,
p69
aVknew Lagos as home.
p70
aa(lp71
VAmong the Yoruba, we have a saying,
p72
aV"Èkó gb\u2019olè, ó gb\u2019\u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9,"
p73
aVwhich can be translated to mean that Lagos will welcome anyone.
p74
aVBut that saying is becoming less and less true.
p75
aVMany Lagosians, including the descendants of those fisherpeople
p76
aVwho arrived generations before my grandfather,
p77
aVare now being pushed out
p78
aVto make room for an emergent city
p79
aVthat has been described as "the new Dubai."
p80
aVYou see, Lagos inspires big dreams, even in its leaders,
p81
aVand successive governments have declared aspirations
p82
aVtowards a megacity where poverty does not exist.
p83
aVUnfortunately, instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty
p84
aVas you would expect,
p85
aVthe strategy of choice focuses on eliminating the poor.
p86
aa(lp87
VLast October, the Governor announced plans
p88
aVto demolish every single waterfront settlement in Lagos.
p89
aVThere are more than 40 of these indigenous communities
p90
aVall over the city,
p91
aVwith over 300,000 people living in them.
p92
aVOtodo Gbame,
p93
aVa hundred-year-old fishing village
p94
aVwith a population about three-quarters that of Monaco
p95
aVand similar potential for beachfront luxury \u2014
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
Vwas one of the first to be targeted.
p100
aa(lp101
VI first heard of Otodo Gbame after the demolition started.
p102
aVWhen I visited in November 2016, I met Magdalene Aiyefoju.
p103
aVShe is a now-homeless woman
p104
aVwhose surname means, "the world is blind."
p105
aVMagdalene's son Basil was one of over 20 people
p106
aVwho were shot, drowned
p107
aVor presumed dead in that land grab.
p108
aVStanding outside her shelter, I saw the two white-sand football fields
p109
aVwhere Basil used to play.
p110
aVSpread all around us were the ruins of schools, churches,
p111
aVa primary health center, shops,
p112
aVthousands of homes.
p113
aVYoung children enthusiastically helped to put up shelters,
p114
aVand about 5,000 of the residents, with nowhere else to go,
p115
aVsimply stayed put.
p116
aVAnd then in April,
p117
aVstate security personnel came back.
p118
aVThis time, they cleared the community out completely,
p119
aVwith beatings, bullets and fire.
p120
aVAs I speak, there are construction crews preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches
p121
aVfor anyone who can afford a multi-million-dollar view.
p122
aVThe new development is called "Periwinkle Estate."
p123
aa(lp124
VForced evictions are incredibly violent and, of course, unconstitutional.
p125
aVAnd yet, they happen so often in so many of our cities,
p126
aVbecause the first thing we are taught to forget about poor people
p127
aVis that they are people.
p128
aVWe believe that a home is a thing a person absolutely has a right to,
p129
aVunless the person is poor and the home is built a certain way
p130
aVin a certain neighborhood.
p131
aVBut there is no single definition of the word "home."
p132
aVAfter all, what is a slum besides an organic response
p133
aVto acute housing deficits and income inequality?
p134
aVAnd what is a shanty if not a person making a home for themselves
p135
aVagainst all odds?
p136
aVSlums are an imperfect housing solution,
p137
aVbut they are also prime examples of the innovation, adaptability
p138
aVand resilience at the foundation \u2014
p139
aVand the heart \u2014
p140
aVof every functional city.
p141
aVYou don't need to be the new Dubai
p142
aVwhen you're already Lagos.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VWe have our own identity,
p147
aVour own rhythm,
p148
aVand as anyone who knows Lagos can tell you,
p149
aVpoor Lagosians are very often the source of the city's character.
p150
aVWithout its poor, Lagos would not be known for its music
p151
aVor its endless energy
p152
aVor even the fact that you can buy an ice cold drink or a puppy
p153
aVthrough your car window.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VThe conditions that cause us to define certain neighborhoods as slums
p158
aVcan be effectively improved,
p159
aVbut not without recognizing the humanity and the agency
p160
aVof the people living in them.
p161
aVIn Lagos, where public goods are rarely publicly available,
p162
aVslum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solutions.
p163
aVAfter being disconnected from the grid for months
p164
aVbecause the power company couldn't figure out how to collect bills,
p165
aVone settlement designed a system that collectivized remittances
p166
aVand got everyone cheaper rates into the bargain.
p167
aVAnother settlement created a reform program
p168
aVthat hires local bad boys as security.
p169
aVThey know every trick and every hideout,
p170
aVso now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and reported to police
p171
aVand fewer of the youth end up engaging in criminal activity.
p172
aVYet another settlement recently completed
p173
aVa flood-safe, eco-friendly communal toilet system.
p174
aVModels like these are being adopted across Lagos.
p175
aa(lp176
VInformal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem.
p177
aVIn fact, the real problems are the factors that create them,
p178
aVlike the entrenchment of poverty,
p179
aVsocial exclusion
p180
aVand state failures.
p181
aVWhen our governments frame slums as threats
p182
aVin order to justify violent land grabs or forced evictions,
p183
aVthey're counting on those of us who live in formal housing
p184
aVto tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.
p185
aVRather, we must remind them
p186
aVthat governments exist to serve not only those who build
p187
aVand live in luxury homes,
p188
aVbut also those who clean and guard them.
p189
aVOur \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
Vour realities may differ,
p194
aVbut our rights don't.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe Lagos state government,
p197
aVlike far too many on our continent,
p198
aVpays lip service to ideas of inclusion,
p199
aVwhile acting as though progress can only be achieved
p200
aVby the erasure, exploitation and even elimination of groups
p201
aVit considers expendable.
p202
aVPeople living with disabilities who hawk or beg on Lagos streets
p203
aVare rounded up, extorted
p204
aVand detained.
p205
aVWomen in low-income neighborhoods are picked up
p206
aVand charged with prostitution,
p207
aVregardless of what they actually do for a living.
p208
aVGay citizens are scapegoated to distract from real political problems.
p209
aVBut people, like cities, are resilient,
p210
aVand no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence
p211
aVcan fully eliminate any of us.
p212
aVProstitutes, women and women who work as prostitutes
p213
aVstill haven't gone extinct,
p214
aVdespite centuries of active suppression.
p215
aVQueer Africans continue to exist,
p216
aVeven though queerness is now criminalized in most parts of the continent.
p217
aVAnd I'm fairly certain that poor people don't generally tend to just disappear
p218
aVbecause they've been stripped of everything they have.
p219
aa(lp220
VWe are all already here,
p221
aVand that answers the question
p222
aVof whether or not we belong.
p223
aa(lp224
VWhen those fisherpeople started to sail down the lagoon
p225
aVin search of new homes,
p226
aVit could not have occurred to them
p227
aVthat the city that would rise up around them
p228
aVwould one day insist that they do not belong in it.
p229
aVI like to believe that my grandfather,
p230
aVin mapping new frontiers for Lagos,
p231
aVwas trying to open it up
p232
aVto make room for other people to be welcomed by the city
p233
aVin the same way that he was.
p234
aVOn my way here, my grandma called me
p235
aVto remind me how proud she was,
p236
aVhow proud [my grandfather] and my mother would have been.
p237
aVI am their dreams come true.
p238
aVBut there is no reason why their dreams \u2014 or mine, for that matter \u2014
p239
aVare allowed to come true
p240
aVwhile those of others are turned to nightmares.
p241
aVAnd lest we forget:
p242
aVthe minimum requirement for a dream
p243
aVis a safe place to lay your head.
p244
aa(lp245
VIt is too late now for Basil,
p246
aVbut not for Magdalene,
p247
aVnot for the hundreds of thousands,
p248
aVthe millions still under threat in Lagos
p249
aVor any of our cities.
p250
aVThe world does not have to remain blind
p251
aVto the suffering that is created when we deny people's humanity,
p252
aVor even to the incredible potential for growth that exists
p253
aVwhen we recognize and value all contributions.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe must hold our governments
p256
aVand ourselves
p257
aVaccountable
p258
aVfor keeping our shared cities safe for everyone in them,
p259
aVbecause the only cities worth building \u2014
p260
aVindeed, the only futures worth dreaming of \u2014
p261
aVare those that include all of us,
p262
aVno matter who we are
p263
aVor how we make homes for ourselves.
p264
