V[Sanskrit]
p6
aVThis is an ode to the mother goddess,
p7
aVthat most of us in India learn when we are children.
p8
aVI learned it when I was four
p9
aVat my mother's knee.
p10
aVThat year she introduced me to dance,
p11
aVand thus began
p12
aVmy tryst with classical dance.
p13
aVSince then \u2014 it's been four decades now \u2014
p14
aVI've trained with the best in the field,
p15
aVperformed across the globe,
p16
aVtaught young and old alike,
p17
aVcreated, collaborated,
p18
aVchoreographed,
p19
aVand wove a rich tapestry
p20
aVof artistry, achievement and awards.
p21
aVThe crowning glory was in 2007,
p22
aVwhen I received this country's
p23
aVfourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,
p24
aVfor my contribution to art.
p25

VBut nothing, nothing prepared me
p29
aVfor what I was to hear
p30
aVon the first of July 2008.
p31
aVI heard the word "carcinoma."
p32
aVYes, breast cancer.
p33
aVAs I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,
p34
aVI heard other words:
p35
aV"cancer," "stage," "grade."
p36
aVUntil then, Cancer was the zodiac
p37
aVsign of my friend,
p38
aVstage was what I performed on,
p39
aVand grades were what I got in school.
p40
aVThat day, I realized
p41
aVI had an unwelcome, uninvited,
p42
aVnew life partner.
p43
aVAs a dancer,
p44
aVI know the nine rasas or the navarasas:
p45
aVanger, valor,
p46
aVdisgust, humor
p47
aVand fear.
p48
aVI thought I knew what fear was.
p49
aVThat day, I learned what fear was.
p50
aa(lp51
VOvercome with the enormity of it all
p52
aVand the complete feeling of loss of control,
p53
aVI shed copious tears
p54
aVand asked my dear husband, Jayant.
p55
aVI said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
p56
aVIs this the end of my dance?"
p57
aVAnd he, the positive soul that he is,
p58
aVsaid, "No, this is just a hiatus,
p59
aVa hiatus during the treatment,
p60
aVand you'll get back to doing what you do best."
p61
aa(lp62
VI realized then
p63
aVthat I, who thought I had complete control of my life,
p64
aVhad control of only three things:
p65
aVMy thought, my mind \u2014
p66
aVthe images that these thoughts created \u2014
p67
aVand the action that derived from it.
p68
aVSo here I was wallowing
p69
aVin a vortex of emotions
p70
aVand depression and what have you,
p71
aVwith the enormity of the situation,
p72
aVwanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
p73
aVI wanted to go from where I was
p74
aVto where I wanted to be,
p75
aVfor which I needed something.
p76
aVI needed something that would pull me out of all this.
p77
aVSo I dried my tears,
p78
aVand I declared to the world at large ...
p79
aVI said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,
p80
aVand I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
p81
aa(lp82
VI also declared to the world at large
p83
aVthat I would ride it out,
p84
aVand I would not allow cancer to ride me.
p85
aVBut to go from where I was
p86
aVto where I wanted to be,
p87
aVI needed something.
p88
aVI needed an anchor, an image,
p89
aVa peg
p90
aVto peg this process on,
p91
aVso that I could go from there.
p92
aVAnd I found that in my dance,
p93
aVmy dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,
p94
aVmy very life breath.
p95
aVBut it wasn't easy.
p96
aVBelieve me, it definitely wasn't easy.
p97
aVHow do you keep cheer
p98
aVwhen you go from beautiful
p99
aVto bald in three days?
p100
aVHow do you not despair
p101
aVwhen, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,
p102
aVclimbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,
p103
aVthat to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
p104
aVHow do you not get overwhelmed
p105
aVby the despair and the misery of it all?
p106
aVAll I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
p107
aVBut I kept telling myself fear and tears
p108
aVare options I did not have.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I would drag myself into my dance studio \u2014
p111
aVbody, mind and spirit \u2014 every day into my dance studio,
p112
aVand learn everything I learned
p113
aVwhen I was four, all over again,
p114
aVreworked, relearned, regrouped.
p115
aVIt was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
p116
aVDifficult.
p117
aVI focused on my mudras,
p118
aVon the imagery of my dance,
p119
aVon the poetry and the metaphor
p120
aVand the philosophy of the dance itself.
p121
aVAnd slowly, I moved out
p122
aVof that miserable state of mind.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut I needed something else.
p125
aVI needed something to go that extra mile,
p126
aVand I found it in that metaphor
p127
aVwhich I had learned from my mother when I was four.
p128
aVThe metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,
p129
aVof Durga.
p130
aVDurga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,
p131
aVcreated by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
p132
aVDurga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,
p133
aVher 18 arms
p134
aVready for warfare,
p135
aVas she rode astride her lion
p136
aVinto the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
p137
aVDurga, the epitome
p138
aVof creative feminine energy,
p139
aVor shakti.
p140
aVDurga, the fearless one.
p141
aVI made that image of Durga
p142
aVand her every attribute, her every nuance,
p143
aVmy very own.
p144
aa(lp145
VPowered by the symbology of a myth
p146
aVand the passion of my training,
p147
aVI brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,
p148
aVlaser-sharp focus to such an extent
p149
aVthat I danced a few weeks after surgery.
p150
aVI danced through chemo and radiation cycles,
p151
aVmuch to the dismay of my oncologist.
p152
aVI danced between chemo and radiation cycles
p153
aVand badgered him to fit it
p154
aVto my performing dance schedule.
p155
aVWhat I had done
p156
aVis I had tuned out of cancer
p157
aVand tuned into my dance.
p158
aVYes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
p159
aa(lp160
VMy story
p161
aVis a story of overcoming setbacks,
p162
aVobstacles and challenges
p163
aVthat life throws at you.
p164
aVMy story is the power of thought.
p165
aVMy story is the power of choice.
p166
aVIt's the power of focus.
p167
aVIt's the power of bringing ourselves
p168
aVto the attention of something that so animates you,
p169
aVso moves you,
p170
aVthat something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
p171
aVMy story is the power of a metaphor.
p172
aVIt's the power of an image.
p173
aVMine was that of Durga,
p174
aVDurga the fearless one.
p175
aVShe was also called Simhanandini,
p176
aVthe one who rode the lion.
p177
aa(lp178
VAs I ride out,
p179
aVas I ride my own inner strength,
p180
aVmy own inner resilience,
p181
aVarmed as I am with what medication can provide
p182
aVand continue treatment,
p183
aVas I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,
p184
aVasking my rogue cells to behave,
p185
aVI want to be known not as a cancer survivor,
p186
aVbut as a cancer conqueror.
p187
