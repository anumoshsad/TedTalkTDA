VOne of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet
p4
aVis that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.
p5
aVAnd so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.
p6
aVIn 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper
p7
aVin New York City.
p8
aVAnd it cost about 500 dollars to start it,
p9
aVwhich was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.
p10
aVBy 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing
p11
aV\u2014 starting what was experienced as a mass\u2014circulation daily paper
p12
aV\u2014 would come to cost two and a half million dollars.
p13
aV10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.
p14
aVThat's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
p15
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today,
p16
aVand how that relates to the emergence of social production.
p17
aa(lp18
VStarting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement
p19
aVfor making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation
p20
aVbetween producers \u2014 who had to be able to raise financial capital,
p21
aVjust like any other industrial organization \u2014
p22
aVand passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of
p23
aVthings that this industrial model could produce.
p24
aVNow, the term "information society," "information economy,"
p25
aVfor a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after
p26
aVthe industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening
p27
aVtoday, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.
p28
aVIt's just been industrial,
p29
aVwhich means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money
p30
aVto pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,
p31
aVand the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.
p32
aVAnd that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,
p33
aVdepending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored
p34
aVthe way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002,
p37
aVthe world of supercomputers had a bombshell.
p38
aVThe Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer \u2014
p39
aVthe NEC Earth Simulator \u2014 taking the primary from the U.S.,
p40
aVand about two years later \u2014 this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point
p41
aVoperations per second that the computer's capable of running \u2014
p42
aVsigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.
p43
aVAll of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,
p44
aVthere's another supercomputer running in the world \u2014 SETI@home.
p45
aVFour and a half million users around the world, contributing their
p46
aVleftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,
p47
aVby running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create
p48
aVa massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data
p49
aVcoming from radio telescopes.
p50
aa(lp51
VWhat this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way
p52
aVinformation production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become
p53
aVless capital intensive \u2014 that there's less money that's required
p54
aV\u2014 but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,
p55
aVis radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,
p56
aVhas one of these, or something rather like it \u2014 a computer.
p57
aVThey're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.
p58
aVAnd computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of
p59
aVpractically every connected person \u2014 and these are the basic physical
p60
aVcapital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,
p61
aVin the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution,
p64
aVthe most important means, the most important components of the core
p65
aVeconomic activities \u2014 remember, we are in an information economy
p66
aV\u2014 of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,
p67
aVare in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've
p68
aVseen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation
p69
aVcapacity in the hands of the entire population,
p70
aVand we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience
p71
aV\u2014 the other major experience, the other major input \u2014
p72
aVwhich unlike simple labor \u2014 stand here turning this lever all day long \u2014
p73
aVis not something that's the same or fungible among people.
p74
aVAny one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours
p75
aVto someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit
p76
aVwhat you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.
p77
aVIn that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input
p78
aVinto production as we hold this machine.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know
p81
aVis the story of free or open source software.
p82
aVThis is market share of Apache Web server
p83
aV\u2014 one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.
p84
aVIn 1995, two groups of people said,
p85
aV"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"
p86
aVOne was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,
p87
aVyou know, we really need this, we should write one,
p88
aVand what are we going to do with what \u2014
p89
aVwell, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.
p90
aVThe other was Microsoft.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control
p93
aVanything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market
p94
aVand was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?
p95
aVThink of it in minivans. A group of automobile
p96
aVengineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?
p97
aVBut, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,
p98
aVincluding the major e-commerce site \u2014 70 percent of a critical application
p99
aVon which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in
p100
aVdirect competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue \u2014
p101
aVin a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.
p102
aVSoftware has done this in a way that's been very visible, because
p103
aVit's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars
p106
aVthat they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four
p107
aVfully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,
p108
aVput it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,
p109
aVwill actually spend five minutes here,
p110
aV10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,
p111
aV85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a
p112
aVfaster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,
p113
aV"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"
p114
aVonce you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to
p117
aV\u2014 well, not so little, medium little \u2014 tries to do research on Barbie.
p118
aVAnd she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.
p119
aVThis is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,
p120
aVincluding, "manufacturers" \u2014 plural \u2014 "now more commonly produce
p121
aVethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better
p122
aVthan what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,
p123
aVwhich is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)
p124
aVOn the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article
p125
aV\u2014 and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here \u2014
p126
aVbut roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,
p127
aVincluding the controversies over body image and commercialization,
p128
aVthe claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnother portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.
p131
aVThe claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look \u2014 originally, not anymore
p132
aV\u2014 we hire people to look at websites and tell you \u2014
p133
aVif they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000
p134
aVpassionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,
p135
aVeach one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,
p136
aVto say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,
p137
aVeach one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred
p138
aVfully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,
p139
aVit's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social
p140
aVand psychological motivations to do something interesting.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation
p143
aVof Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing \u2014
p144
aVthe decision about what's relevant \u2014 to the community of the Web as a whole,
p145
aVdoing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.
p146
aVThe critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying
p147
aVwhich is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,
p148
aVpeople out there on the Web, for whatever reason \u2014 vanity, pleasure \u2014
p149
aVproduced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.
p150
aVAnd again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,
p151
aVAdiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,
p152
aVwhich you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic
p153
aVmarket-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression.
p156
aVBut remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials
p157
aV\u2014 our PCs \u2014 we share them together. We also see this in wireless.
p158
aVIt used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an
p159
aVarea, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.
p160
aVWhat we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated
p161
aVthat we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,
p162
aVand overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this
p163
aVto build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:
p164
aVWhen I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;
p165
aVand when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.
p166
aVAnd this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some
p167
aVplaces in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.
p168
aa(lp169
VIf in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
p170
aVIt's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,
p171
aVseven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
p172
aVIt has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to
p173
aVbe robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,
p174
aVarmed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.
p175
aVIt would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.
p176
aVRight? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,
p177
aVit's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,
p178
aVfor very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their
p179
aVstorage to create something.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional
p182
aVframework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which
p183
aVyou could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;
p184
aVthey could be decentralized, or centralized.
p185
aVThe price system was a market-based and decentralized system.
p186
aVIf things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,
p187
aVyou had firms, if you wanted to be in the market \u2014 or you had governments
p188
aVor sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.
p189
aVIt was too expensive to have decentralized social production,
p190
aVto have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.
p191
aVThat was, in fact, economic.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system
p194
aVof social sharing and exchange.
p195
aVNot that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,
p196
aVas social beings. We do it all the time.
p197
aVIt's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.
p198
aVWhat characterizes them is decentralized authority.
p199
aVYou don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.
p200
aVMay I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,
p201
aVif they want to, by themselves or with others,
p202
aVbecause property is one mechanism of coordination.
p203
aVBut it's not the only one.
p204
aa(lp205
VInstead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use
p206
aVproperty and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are
p207
aVinteresting problems; who's available and good for something;
p208
aVmotivation structures \u2014 remember, money isn't always the best motivator.
p209
aVIf you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,
p210
aVyou don't increase the probability of being invited back.
p211
aVAnd if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VIt also requires certain new organizational approaches.
p214
aVAnd in particular, what we've seen is task organization.
p215
aVYou have to hire people who know what they're doing.
p216
aVYou have to hire them to spend a lot of time.
p217
aVNow, take the same problem,
p218
aVchunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.
p219
aVFive minutes, instead of watching TV?
p220
aVFive minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
p221
aVJust because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more
p222
aVinvolved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, a new social phenomenon is emerging.
p225
aVIt's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.
p226
aVPeer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;
p227
aVfree and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;
p228
aVSkype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;
p229
aVWikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.
p230
aVBut it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.
p231
aVAs you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,
p232
aVyou have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.
p233
aVInstead of building well-behaved appliances
p234
aV\u2014 things that you know what they'll do in advance \u2014
p235
aVyou begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,
p236
aVa new set of things people value.
p237
aVYou build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.
p238
aVLike Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,
p239
aVyou're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.
p240
aVAnd you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense
p241
aVbuild it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?
p242
aa(lp243
VYou have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings.
p244
aVThat'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.
p245
aVI will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary
p246
aV\u2014 that's what Google does, essentially.
p247
aVThat's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, social production is a real fact, not a fad.
p250
aVIt is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.
p251
aVSocial relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever
p252
aVwere as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient
p253
aVbecause of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,
p254
aVthe lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut \u2014 and this is the dark lining \u2014 it is threatened by
p257
aV\u2014 in the same way that it threatens \u2014 the incumbent industrial systems.
p258
aVSo next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,
p259
aVa telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.
p260
aVIt is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,
p261
aVand the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.
p262
aVBecause it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be
p263
aVfor the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,
p264
aVor for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,
p265
aVand change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.
p266
