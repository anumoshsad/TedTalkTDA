VThere are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money.
p4
aVIn fact, they make their living on this stuff.
p5
aVI'm going to try to save you all the time and money
p6
aVand go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me.
p7
aVStarted a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com.
p8
aVIt's what you'd call a social news website;
p9
aa(lp10
Vbasically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web.
p11
aVYou find some interesting content \u2014 say, a TED Talk \u2014 submit it to Reddit,
p12
aVand a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't.
p13
aVThat creates the front page.
p14
aVIt's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day.
p15
aVBut this isn't about Reddit.
p16
aVIt's about discovering new things that pop up on the web.
p17
aVIn the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes,
p18
aVall kinds of trends get born right on our front page.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales.
p21
aVWell, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization
p22
aVthat wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign.
p23
aVThe whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it.
p24
aVOne of the ways they wanted to do it
p25
aVwas to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales.
p26
aVBut to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo in true web fashion, they put together a poll,
p29
aVwhere they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names.
p30
aVI believe this is the Farsi word for "immortal."
p31
aVI think this means "divine power of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.
p32
aVAnd then there was this: "Mister Splashy Pants."
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd this was a special name.
p37
aVMister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet.
p38
aVIn fact, someone on Reddit thought,
p39
aV"What a great thing, we should all vote this up."
p40
aVAnd Redditors responded and all agreed.
p41
aVSo the voting started.
p42
aVWe got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day,
p43
aVfrom the alien to Splashy, to help the cause.
p44
aVAnd it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing
p45
aVand the rest of the Internet started saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"
p46
aa(lp47
VSo it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started,
p48
aVto 70 percent at the end of voting.
p49
aVPretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.
p50
aVJust kidding \u2014 Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it,
p51
aVbecause they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win.
p52
aVThey said, "No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting."
p53
aa(lp54
VWell, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd the Reddit community \u2014 really, the rest of the Internet,
p59
aVreally got behind this.
p60
aVFacebook groups were created.
p61
aVFacebook applications were created.
p62
aVThe idea was, "Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants."
p63
aVPeople were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VThis was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes.
p68
aVTo give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.
p69
aa(lp70
VThere was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
p71
aVWhich is obvious. It's a great name.
p72
aVEveryone wants to hear their news anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VI think that's what helped drive this.
p77
aVWhat was cool were the repercussions.
p78
aVGreenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it \u2014
p79
aVMister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,
p80
aVan e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
p81
aVBut even more important was that they accomplished their mission.
p82
aVThe Japanese government called off their whaling expedition.
p83
aVMission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled,
p84
aVthe whales were happy \u2014 that's a quote.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd actually, Redditors in the Internet community
p89
aVwere happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers.
p90
aVA few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people,
p91
aVreally interested and caught up in this meme.
p92
aVGreenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation.
p93
aVBut this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is how the Internet works. This is that great big secret.
p96
aVThe Internet provides a level playing field.
p97
aVYour link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link.
p98
aVWith a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget.
p99
aVThat is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnother important thing is it costs nothing to get content online.
p102
aVThere are so many publishing tools available,
p103
aVit only takes a few minutes to produce something.
p104
aVand the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.
p105
aa(lp106
VIf you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front.
p107
aVOne of the great lessons Greenpeace learned
p108
aVis that it's OK to lose control,
p109
aVOK to take yourself a little less seriously,
p110
aVgiven that, even though it's a very serious cause,
p111
aVyou could ultimately achieve your goal.
p112
aVThat's the final message I want to share: you can do well online.
p113
aVBut no longer is the message coming from just the top down.
p114
aVIf you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.
p115
aa(lp116
VThank you.
