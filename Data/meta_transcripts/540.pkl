aVAIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.
p5
aVThese Gapminder bubbles show you
p6
aVhow the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,
p7
aVor how we estimate that it was.
p8
aVWhat we are showing here is \u2014
p9
aVon this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.
p10
aVAnd on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.
p11
aVAnd the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,
p12
aVthat shows how many are infected in each country,
p13
aVand the color is the continent.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, you can see United States, in 1983,
p16
aVhad a very low percentage infected,
p17
aVbut due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.
p18
aVThere were quite many people infected in the United States.
p19
aVAnd, up there, you see Uganda.
p20
aVThey had almost five percent infected,
p21
aVand quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.
p22
aVAnd they were probably the most infected country in the world.
p23
aVNow, what has happened?
p24
aVNow you have understood the graph
p25
aVand now, in the next 60 seconds,
p26
aVwe will play the HIV epidemic in the world.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut first, I have a new invention here.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVI have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, ready, steady, go!
p37
aVFirst, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
p38
aVThey went upwards like this.
p39
aVIn Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand \u2014
p40
aVthey reached one to two percent.
p41
aVThen, Uganda started to turn back,
p42
aVwhereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,
p43
aVand some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.
p44
aVLook, India got many infected,
p45
aVbut had a low level.
p46
aVAnd almost the same happens here.
p47
aVSee, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,
p48
aVRussia went to one percent.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn the last two to three years,
p51
aVwe have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.
p52
aV25 years it took.
p53
aVBut, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,
p54
aVit's just that they have stopped getting worse.
p55
aVAnd it has \u2014 the steady state is, more or less,
p56
aVone percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.
p57
aVIt means 30 to 40 million people,
p58
aVthe whole of California \u2014 every person,
p59
aVthat's more or less what we have today in the world.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.
p62
aVBotswana \u2014 upper middle-income country in southern Africa,
p63
aVdemocratic government, good economy,
p64
aVand this is what happened there.
p65
aVThey started low, they skyrocketed,
p66
aVthey peaked up there in 2003,
p67
aVand now they are down.
p68
aVBut they are falling only slowly,
p69
aVbecause in Botswana, with good economy and governance,
p70
aVthey can manage to treat people.
p71
aVAnd if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.
p72
aVThese percentages won't come down
p73
aVbecause people can survive 10 to 20 years.
p74
aVSo there's some problem with these metrics now.
p75
aVBut the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,
p76
aVthere the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,
p77
aVbecause people still die.
p78
aVIn spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,
p79
aVall people are not reached by treatment,
p80
aVand of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,
p81
aVonly 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.
p82
aVIt's not realistic with lifelong treatment
p83
aVfor everyone in the poorest countries.
p84
aVBut it's very good that what is done is being done.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut focus now is back on prevention.
p87
aVIt is only by stopping the transmission
p88
aVthat the world will be able to deal with it.
p89
aVDrugs is too costly \u2014 had we had the vaccine,
p90
aVor when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective \u2014
p91
aVbut the drugs are very costly for the poor.
p92
aVNot the drug in itself, but the treatment
p93
aVand the care which is needed around it.
p94
aVSo, when we look at the pattern,
p95
aVone thing comes out very clearly:
p96
aVyou see the blue bubbles
p97
aVand people say HIV is very high in Africa.
p98
aVI would say, HIV is very different in Africa.
p99
aVYou'll find the highest HIV rate in the world
p100
aVin African countries,
p101
aVand yet you'll find Senegal, down here \u2014
p102
aVthe same rate as United States.
p103
aVAnd you'll find Madagascar,
p104
aVand you'll find a lot of African countries
p105
aVabout as low as the rest of the world.
p106
aVIt's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa
p107
aVand things go on in one way in Africa.
p108
aVWe have to stop that.
p109
aVIt's not respectful, and it's not very clever
p110
aVto think that way.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VI had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.
p115
aVI found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVAnd so it is in Africa \u2014 it's a lot of difference.
p118
aVSo, why is it so high? Is it war?
p119
aVNo, it's not. Look here.
p120
aVWar-torn Congo is down there \u2014 two, three, four percent.
p121
aVAnd this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country \u2014 15 percent.
p122
aVAnd there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo \u2014
p123
aVthey have two, three percent infected,
p124
aVand peaceful Zambia \u2014 much higher.
p125
aVThere are now studies clearly showing
p126
aVthat the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,
p127
aVbut this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, is it poverty?
p130
aVWell if you look at the macro level,
p131
aVit seems more money, more HIV.
p132
aVBut that's very simplistic,
p133
aVso let's go down and look at Tanzania.
p134
aVI will split Tanzania in five income groups,
p135
aVfrom the highest income to the lowest income,
p136
aVand here we go.
p137
aVThe ones with the highest income, the better off \u2014 I wouldn't say rich \u2014
p138
aVthey have higher HIV.
p139
aVThe difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,
p140
aVand it is even bigger among women.
p141
aVThere's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,
p142
aVdone by African institutions and researchers
p143
aVtogether with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.
p144
aVSo, this is the difference within Tanzania.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd, I can't avoid showing Kenya.
p147
aVLook here at Kenya.
p148
aVI've split Kenya in its provinces.
p149
aVHere it goes.
p150
aVSee the difference within one African country \u2014
p151
aVit goes from very low level to very high level,
p152
aVand most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo, what is it then?
p155
aVWhy do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?
p156
aVWell, it is more common with multiple partners,
p157
aVthere is less condom use,
p158
aVand there is age-disparate sex \u2014
p159
aVthat is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.
p160
aVWe see higher rates in younger women than younger men
p161
aVin many of these highly affected countries.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut where are they situated?
p164
aVI will swap the bubbles to a map.
p165
aVLook, the highly infected are four percent of all population
p166
aVand they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.
p167
aVHIV exists all over the world.
p168
aVLook, you have bubbles all over the world here.
p169
aVBrazil has many HIV-infected.
p170
aVArab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.
p171
aVThey have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.
p172
aVIndia has many because they are many.
p173
aVSoutheast Asia, and so on.
p174
aVBut, there is one part of Africa \u2014
p175
aVand the difficult thing is, at the same time,
p176
aVnot to make a uniform statement about Africa,
p177
aVnot to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.
p178
aa(lp179
VOn the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,
p180
aVbecause there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.
p181
aVUNAIDS have done good data available, finally,
p182
aVabout the spread of HIV.
p183
aVIt could be concurrency.
p184
aVIt could be some virus types.
p185
aVIt could be that there is other things
p186
aVwhich makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.
p187
aVAfter all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,
p188
aVthe risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.
p189
aVDon't jump to conclusions now on how to
p190
aVbehave tonight and so on.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVBut \u2014 and if you are in an unfavorable situation,
p193
aVmore sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut what we think is that it could be concurrency.
p196
aVAnd what is concurrency?
p197
aVIn Sweden, we have no concurrency.
p198
aVWe have serial monogamy.
p199
aVVodka, New Year's Eve \u2014 new partner for the spring.
p200
aVVodka, Midsummer's Eve \u2014 new partner for the fall.
p201
aVVodka \u2014 and it goes on like this, you know?
p202
aVAnd you collect a big number of exes.
p203
aVAnd we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic \u2014
p204
aVterrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.
p205
aVHIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection
p206
aVand therefore, having more than one partner in the same month
p207
aVis much more dangerous for HIV than others.
p208
aVProbably, it's a combination of this.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd what makes me so happy is that we are moving now
p211
aVtowards fact when we look at this.
p212
aVYou can get this chart, free.
p213
aVWe have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.
p214
aVAnd we hope that when we act on global problems in the future
p215
aVwe will not only have the heart,
p216
aVwe will not only have the money,
p217
aVbut we will also use the brain.
p218
