VChris Anderson: Welcome to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
p4
aVWe're trying to do some bridging here today.
p5
aVYou know, the American dream has inspired millions of people
p6
aVaround the world for many years.
p7
aVToday, I think, you can say that America is divided,
p8
aVperhaps more than ever,
p9
aVand the divisions seem to be getting worse.
p10
aVIt's actually really hard for people on different sides
p11
aVto even have a conversation.
p12
aVPeople almost feel...
p13
aVdisgusted with each other.
p14
aVSome families can't even speak to each other right now.
p15
aVOur purpose in this dialogue today is to try to do something about that,
p16
aVto try to have a different kind of conversation,
p17
aVto do some listening, some thinking, some understanding.
p18
aVAnd I have two people with us to help us do that.
p19
aa(lp20
VThey're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other.
p21
aVThis is not like cable news.
p22
aVThis is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life
p23
aVin the political center or right of the center.
p24
aVThey've immersed themselves in conservative worldviews, if you like.
p25
aVThey know that space very well.
p26
aVAnd we're going to explore together
p27
aVhow to think about what is happening right now,
p28
aVand whether we can find new ways to bridge
p29
aVand just to have wiser, more connected conversations.
p30
aa(lp31
VWith me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,
p32
aVwho has spent a decade working at Fox News,
p33
aVhosting "Fox and Friends" and then "The Real Story,"
p34
aVbefore taking a courageous stance in filing sexual harassment claims
p35
aVagainst Roger Ailes,
p36
aVwhich eventually led to his departure from Fox News.
p37
aVDavid Brooks, who has earned the wrath
p38
aVof many of [The New York Times's] left-leaning readers
p39
aVbecause of his conservative views,
p40
aVand more recently, perhaps, some of the right-leaning readers
p41
aVbecause of his criticism of some aspects of Trump.
p42
aVYet, his columns are usually
p43
aVthe top one, two or three most-read content of the day
p44
aVbecause they're brilliant,
p45
aVbecause they bring psychology and social science
p46
aVto providing understanding for what's going on.
p47
aVSo without further ado, a huge welcome to Gretchen and David.
p48
aVCome and join me.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, Gretchen.
p53
aVSixty-three million Americans voted for Donald Trump.
p54
aVWhy did they do this?
p55
aa(lp56
VGretchen Carlson: There are a lot of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
p57
aVI mean, I think it was a movement of sorts, but it started long ago.
p58
aVIt didn't just happen overnight.
p59
aV"Anger" would be the first word that I would think of \u2014
p60
aVanger with nothing being done in Washington,
p61
aVanger about not being heard.
p62
aVI think there was a huge swath of the population
p63
aVthat feels like Washington never listens to them,
p64
aVyou know, a good part of the middle of America, not just the coasts,
p65
aVand he was somebody they felt was listening to their concerns.
p66
aVSo I think those two issues would be the main reason.
p67
aVI have to throw in there also celebrity.
p68
aVI think that had a huge impact on Donald Trump becoming president.
p69
aa(lp70
VCA: Was the anger justified?
p71
aa(lp72
VDavid Brooks: Yeah, I think so.
p73
aVIn 2015 and early 2016, I wrote about 30 columns
p74
aVwith the following theme:
p75
aVdon't worry, Donald Trump will never be the Republican nominee.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd having done that and gotten that so wrong,
p80
aVI decided to spend the ensuing year just out in Trumpworld,
p81
aVand I found a lot of economic dislocation.
p82
aVI ran into a woman in West Virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom.
p83
aVShe said, "The nice thing about being Catholic is we don't have to speak,
p84
aVand that's good, because we're not word people."
p85
aVThat phrase rung in my head: word people.
p86
aVA lot of us in the TED community are word people,
p87
aVbut if you're not, the economy has not been angled toward you,
p88
aVand so 11 million men, for example, are out of the labor force
p89
aVbecause those jobs are done away.
p90
aVA lot of social injury.
p91
aVYou used to be able to say, "I'm not the richest person in the world,
p92
aVI'm not the most famous,
p93
aVbut my neighbors can count on me and I get some dignity out of that."
p94
aVAnd because of celebritification or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,
p95
aVyou feel invisible.
p96
aVAnd a lot of moral injury, sense of feeling betrayed,
p97
aVand frankly, in this country, we almost have one success story,
p98
aVwhich is you go to college, get a white-collar job, and you're a success,
p99
aVand if you don't fit in that formula,
p100
aVyou feel like you're not respected.
p101
aVAnd so that accumulation of things \u2014
p102
aVand when I talked to Trump voters and still do,
p103
aVI found most of them completely realistic about his failings,
p104
aVbut they said, this is my shot.
p105
aa(lp106
VGC: And yet I predicted that he would be the nominee,
p107
aVbecause I've known him for 27 years.
p108
aVHe's a master marketer,
p109
aVand one of the things he did extremely well
p110
aVthat President Obama also did extremely well,
p111
aVwas simplifying the message,
p112
aVsimplifying down to phrases
p113
aVand to a populist message.
p114
aVEven if he can't achieve it, it sounded good.
p115
aVAnd many people latched on to that simplicity again.
p116
aVIt's something they could grasp onto:
p117
aV"I get that. I want that. That sounds fantastic."
p118
aVAnd I remember when he used to come on my show originally,
p119
aVbefore "The Apprentice" was even "The Apprentice,"
p120
aVand he'd say it was the number one show on TV.
p121
aVI'd say back to him, "No, it's not."
p122
aVAnd he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen."
p123
aVAnd I would say, "No it's not."
p124
aVBut people at home would see that, and they'd be like,
p125
aV"Wow, I should be watching the number one show on TV."
p126
aVAnd \u2014 lo and behold \u2014 it became the number one show on TV.
p127
aVSo he had this, I've seen this ability in him
p128
aVto be the master marketer.
p129
aa(lp130
VCA: It's puzzling to a lot of people on the left
p131
aVthat so many women voted for him,
p132
aVdespite some of his comments.
p133
aa(lp134
VGC: I wrote a column about this for Time Motto,
p135
aVsaying that I really believe that lot of people put on blinders,
p136
aVand maybe for the first time,
p137
aVsome people decided that policies they believed in
p138
aVand being heard and not being invisible anymore
p139
aVwas more important to them
p140
aVthan the way in which he had acted or acts as a human.
p141
aVAnd so human dignity \u2014
p142
aVwhether it would be the dust-up about the disabled reporter,
p143
aVor what happened in that audiotape with Billy Bush
p144
aVand the way in which he spoke about women \u2014
p145
aVthey put that aside
p146
aVand pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that,
p147
aVbecause to them, policies were more important.
p148
aa(lp149
VCA: Right, so just because someone voted for Trump,
p150
aVit's not blind adherence to everything that he's said or stood for.
p151
aa(lp152
VGC: No. I heard a lot of people that would say to me,
p153
aV"Wow, I just wish he would shut up before the election.
p154
aVIf he would just stay quiet, he'd get elected."
p155
aa(lp156
VCA: And so, maybe for people on the left there's a trap there,
p157
aVto sort of despise or just be baffled by the support,
p158
aVassuming that it's for some of the unattractive features.
p159
aVActually, maybe they're supporting him despite those,
p160
aVbecause they see something exciting.
p161
aVThey see a man of action.
p162
aVThey see the choking hold of government being thrown off in some way
p163
aVand they're excited by that.
p164
aa(lp165
VGC: But don't forget we saw that on the left as well \u2014 Bernie Sanders.
p166
aVSo this is one of the commonalities that I think we can talk about today,
p167
aV"The Year of the Outsider," David \u2014 right?
p168
aVAnd even though Bernie Sanders has been in Congress for a long time,
p169
aVhe was deemed an outsider this time.
p170
aVAnd so there was anger on the left as well,
p171
aVand so many people were in favor of Bernie Sanders.
p172
aVSo I see it as a commonality.
p173
aVPeople who like Trump, people who like Bernie Sanders,
p174
aVthey were liking different policies, but the underpinning was anger.
p175
aa(lp176
VCA: David, there's often this narrative, then,
p177
aVthat the sole explanation for Trump's victory and his rise
p178
aVis his tapping into anger in a very visceral way.
p179
aVBut you've written a bit about that it's actually more than that,
p180
aVthat there's a worldview that's being worked on here.
p181
aVCould you talk about that?
p182
aa(lp183
VDB: I would say he understood what, frankly, I didn't,
p184
aVwhich is what debate we were having.
p185
aVAnd so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,
p186
aVand it was the big government versus small government debate.
p187
aVIt was Barry Goldwater versus George McGovern,
p188
aVand that was the debate we had been having for a generation.
p189
aVIt was: Democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality,
p190
aVRepublicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom.
p191
aVThat was the debate.
p192
aVHe understood what I think the two major parties did not,
p193
aVwhich was that's not the debate anymore.
p194
aVThe debate is now open versus closed.
p195
aVOn one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization
p196
aVand the meritocracy blowing at their back,
p197
aVand they tend to favor open trade,
p198
aVopen borders, open social mores,
p199
aVbecause there are so many opportunities.
p200
aVOn the other side are those who feel the headwinds of globalization
p201
aVand the meritocracy just blasting in their faces,
p202
aVand they favor closed trade, closed borders, closed social mores,
p203
aVbecause they just want some security.
p204
aVAnd so he was right on that fundamental issue,
p205
aVand people were willing to overlook a lot to get there.
p206
aVAnd so he felt that sense of security.
p207
aa(lp208
VWe're speaking the morning after Trump's joint session speech.
p209
aVThere are three traditional groups in the Republican Party.
p210
aVThere are the foreign policies hawks
p211
aVwho believe in America as global policeman.
p212
aVTrump totally repudiated that view.
p213
aVSecond, there was the social conservatives
p214
aVwho believed in religious liberty,
p215
aVpro-life,
p216
aVprayer in schools.
p217
aVHe totally ignored that.
p218
aVThere was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue.
p219
aVAnd then there were the fiscal hawks,
p220
aVthe people who wanted to cut down on the national debt, Tea Party,
p221
aVcut the size of government.
p222
aVHe's expanding the size of government!
p223
aVHere's a man who has single-handedly revolutionized a major American party
p224
aVbecause he understood where the debate was headed
p225
aVbefore other people.
p226
aVAnd then guys like Steve Bannon come in
p227
aVand give him substance to his impulses.
p228
aa(lp229
VCA: And so take that a bit further,
p230
aVand maybe expand a bit more on your insights
p231
aVinto Steve Bannon's worldview.
p232
aVBecause he's sometimes tarred in very simple terms
p233
aVas this dangerous, racist, xenophobic, anger-sparking person.
p234
aVThere's more to the story; that is perhaps an unfair simplification.
p235
aa(lp236
VDB: I think that part is true,
p237
aVbut there's another part that's probably true, too.
p238
aVHe's part of a global movement.
p239
aVIt's like being around Marxists in 1917.
p240
aVThere's him here, there's the UKIP party, there's the National Front in France,
p241
aVthere's Putin, there's a Turkish version, a Philippine version.
p242
aVSo we have to recognize that this is a global intellectual movement.
p243
aVAnd it believes
p244
aVthat wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility
p245
aVthe way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do.
p246
aVIt's held in \u2014 the German word is the "volk" \u2014 in the people,
p247
aVin the common, instinctive wisdom of the plain people.
p248
aVAnd the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders.
p249
aVAnd he's got a strategy for how to get there.
p250
aVHe's got a series of policies to bring the people up
p251
aVand repudiate the outsiders,
p252
aVwhether those outsiders are Islam, Mexicans, the media,
p253
aVthe coastal elites...
p254
aVAnd there's a whole worldview there; it's a very coherent worldview.
p255
aVI sort of have more respect for him.
p256
aVI loathe what he stands for and I think he's wrong on the substance,
p257
aVbut it's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas
p258
aVfind a vehicle, Donald Trump,
p259
aVand then try to take control of the White House
p260
aVin order to advance his viewpoint.
p261
aa(lp262
VCA: So it's almost become, like, that the core question of our time now is:
p263
aVCan you be patriotic but also have a global mindset?
p264
aVAre these two things implacably opposed to each other?
p265
aVI mean, a lot of conservatives
p266
aVand, to the extent that it's a different category,
p267
aVa lot of Trump supporters,
p268
aVare infuriated by the coastal elites and the globalists
p269
aVbecause they see them as, sort of, not cheering for America,
p270
aVnot embracing fully American values.
p271
aVI mean, have you seen that in your conversations with people,
p272
aVin your understanding of their mindset?
p273
aa(lp274
VGC: I do think that there's a huge difference between \u2014
p275
aVI hate to put people in categories, but,
p276
aVMiddle America versus people who live on the coasts.
p277
aVIt's an entirely different existence.
p278
aVAnd I grew up in Minnesota, so I have an understanding of Middle America,
p279
aVand I've never forgotten it.
p280
aVAnd maybe that's why I have an understanding of what happened here,
p281
aVbecause those people often feel like nobody's listening to them,
p282
aVand that we're only concentrating on California and New York.
p283
aVAnd so I think that was a huge reason why Trump was elected.
p284
aVI mean, these people felt like they were being heard.
p285
aVWhether or not patriotism falls into that,
p286
aVI'm not sure about that.
p287
aVI do know one thing:
p288
aVa lot of things Trump talked about last night are not conservative things.
p289
aVHad Hillary Clinton gotten up and given that speech,
p290
aVnot one Republican would have stood up to applaud.
p291
aVI mean, he's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure.
p292
aVThat is not a conservative viewpoint.
p293
aVHe talked about government-mandated maternity leave.
p294
aVA lot of women may love that; it's not a conservative viewpoint.
p295
aVSo it's fascinating
p296
aVthat people who loved what his message was during the campaign,
p297
aVI'm not sure \u2014 how do you think they'll react to that?
p298
aa(lp299
VDB: I should say I grew up in Lower Manhattan,
p300
aVin the triangle between ABC Carpets, the Strand Bookstore
p301
aVand The Odeon restaurant.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VGC: Come to Minnesota sometime!
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VCA: You are a card-carrying member of the coastal elite, my man.
p310
aVBut what did you make of the speech last night?
p311
aVIt seemed to be a move to a more moderate position,
p312
aVon the face of it.
p313
aa(lp314
VDB: Yeah, I thought it was his best speech,
p315
aVand it took away the freakishness of him.
p316
aVI do think he's a moral freak,
p317
aVand I think he'll be undone by that fact,
p318
aVthe fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything
p319
aVand is uncurious about it.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VBut if you take away these minor flaws,
p324
aVI think we got to see him at his best,
p325
aVand it was revealing for me to see him at his best,
p326
aVbecause to me, it exposed a central contradiction that he's got to confront,
p327
aVthat a lot of what he's doing is offering security.
p328
aVSo, "I'm ordering closed borders,
p329
aVI'm going to secure the world for you, for my people."
p330
aVBut then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies,
p331
aVlike health care reform, which is about private health care accounts,
p332
aVthat's not security, that's risk.
p333
aVEducational vouchers: that's risk. Deregulation: that's risk.
p334
aVThere's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset
p335
aVand a lot of the policies, which are very risk-oriented.
p336
aVAnd what I would say, especially having spent this year,
p337
aVthe people in rural Minnesota, in New Mexico \u2014
p338
aVthey've got enough risk in their lives.
p339
aVAnd so they're going to say, "No thank you."
p340
aVAnd I think his health care repeal will fail for that reason.
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: But despite the criticisms you just made of him,
p343
aVit does at least seem that he's listening
p344
aVto a surprisingly wide range of voices;
p345
aVit's not like everyone is coming from the same place.
p346
aVAnd maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion, but \u2014
p347
aa(lp348
VGC: I actually don't think he's listening to a wide range of voices.
p349
aVI think he's listening to very few people.
p350
aVThat's just my impression of it.
p351
aVI believe that some of the things he said last night
p352
aVhad Ivanka all over them.
p353
aVSo I believe he was listening to her before that speech.
p354
aVAnd he was Teleprompter Trump last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.
p355
aVAnd that's why, before we came out here,
p356
aVI said, "We better check Twitter to see if anything's changed."
p357
aVAnd also I think you have to keep in mind
p358
aVthat because he's such a unique character,
p359
aVwhat was the bar that we were expecting last night?
p360
aVWas it here or here or here?
p361
aVAnd so he comes out and gives a looking political speech,
p362
aVand everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it."
p363
aVIt just depends on which direction he goes.
p364
aa(lp365
VDB: Yeah, and we're trying to build bridges here,
p366
aVand especially for an audience that may have contempt for Trump,
p367
aVit's important to say, no, this is a real thing.
p368
aVBut as I try my best to go an hour showing respect for him,
p369
aVmy thyroid is surging,
p370
aVbecause I think the oddities of his character
p371
aVreally are condemnatory and are going to doom him.
p372
aa(lp373
VCA: Your reputation is as a conservative.
p374
aVPeople would you describe you as right of center,
p375
aVand yet here you are with this visceral reaction against him
p376
aVand some of what he stands for.
p377
aVI mean, I'm \u2014 how do you have a conversation?
p378
aVThe people who support him, on evidence so far,
p379
aVare probably pretty excited.
p380
aVHe's certainly shown real engagement
p381
aVin a lot of what he promised to do,
p382
aVand there is a strong desire to change the system radically.
p383
aVPeople hate what government has become and how it's left them out.
p384
aa(lp385
VGC: I totally agree with that,
p386
aVbut I think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night
p387
aVthat we used to call the bad s-word, "stimulus," I find it completely ironic.
p388
aVTo spend a trillion dollars on something \u2014
p389
aVthat is not a conservative viewpoint.
p390
aVThen again, I don't really believe he's a Republican.
p391
aa(lp392
VDB: And I would say, as someone who identifies as conservative:
p393
aVfirst of all,
p394
aVto be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics.
p395
aVSamuel Johnson said, "Of all the things that human hearts endure,
p396
aVhow few are those that kings can cause and cure."
p397
aVPolitics is a limited realm;
p398
aVwhat matters most is the moral nature of the society.
p399
aVAnd so I have to think character comes first,
p400
aVand a man who doesn't pass the character threshold
p401
aVcannot be a good president.
p402
aVSecond, I'm the kind of conservative who \u2014
p403
aVI harken back to Alexander Hamilton,
p404
aVwho was a Latino hip-hop star from the heights \u2014
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
Vbut his definition of America was very future-oriented.
p409
aVHe was a poor boy from the islands
p410
aVwho had this rapid and amazing rise to success,
p411
aVand he wanted government to give poor boys and girls like him
p412
aVa chance to succeed,
p413
aVusing limited but energetic government to create social mobility.
p414
aVFor him and for Lincoln and for Teddy Roosevelt,
p415
aVthe idea of America was the idea of the future.
p416
aVWe may have division and racism and slavery in our past,
p417
aVbut we have a common future.
p418
aVThe definition of America that Steve Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.
p419
aVIt's nostalgic; it's for the past.
p420
aVAnd that is not traditionally the American identity.
p421
aVThat's traditionally, frankly, the Russian identity.
p422
aVThat's how they define virtue.
p423
aVAnd so I think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal
p424
aVof what conservatism used to stand for.
p425
aa(lp426
VCA: Well, I'd like actually like to hear from you,
p427
aVand if we see some comments coming in from some of you, we'll \u2014
p428
aVoh, well here's one right now.
p429
aVJeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried to convince progressive friends
p430
aVthat they need to understand what motivates Trump supporters,
p431
aVyet many of them have given up trying to understand
p432
aVin the face of what they perceive as lies, selfishness and hatred.
p433
aVHow would you reach out to such people, the Tea Party of the left,
p434
aVto try to bridge this divide?
p435
aa(lp436
VGC: I actually think there are commonalities in anger,
p437
aVas I expressed earlier.
p438
aVSo I think you can come to the table, both being passionate about something.
p439
aVSo at least you care.
p440
aVAnd I would like to believe \u2014 the c-word has also become
p441
aVa horrible word \u2014 "compromise," right?
p442
aVSo you have the far left and the far right,
p443
aVand compromise \u2014 forget it.
p444
aVThose groups don't want to even think about it.
p445
aVBut you have a huge swath of voters, myself included,
p446
aVwho are registered independents,
p447
aVlike 40 percent of us, right?
p448
aVSo there is a huge faction of America that wants to see change
p449
aVand wants to see people come together.
p450
aVIt's just that we have to figure out
p451
aVhow to do that.
p452
aa(lp453
VCA: So let's talk about that for a minute,
p454
aVbecause we're having these TED Dialogues, we're trying to bridge.
p455
aVThere's a lot of people out there, right now, perhaps especially on the left,
p456
aVwho think this is a terrible idea,
p457
aVthat actually, the only moral response to the great tyranny
p458
aVthat may be about to emerge in America
p459
aVis to resist it at every stage, is to fight it tooth and nail,
p460
aVit's a mistake to try and do this.
p461
aVJust fight!
p462
aVIs there a case for that?
p463
aa(lp464
VDB: It depends what "fight" means. If it means literal fighting, then no.
p465
aVIf it means marching, well maybe marching to raise consciousness,
p466
aVthat seems fine.
p467
aVBut if you want change in this country, we do it through parties and politics.
p468
aVWe organize parties, and those parties are big, diverse, messy coalitions,
p469
aVand we engage in politics,
p470
aVand politics is always morally unsatisfying
p471
aVbecause it's always a bunch of compromises.
p472
aVBut politics is essentially a competition between partial truths.
p473
aVThe Trump people have a piece of the truth in America.
p474
aVI think Trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question,
p475
aVbut they have some truth,
p476
aVand it's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the country,
p477
aVit's truth found in the spread of loneliness,
p478
aVit's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted.
p479
aVThey peaked professionally at age 30,
p480
aVand it's all been downhill since.
p481
aVAnd so, understanding that doesn't take fighting,
p482
aVit takes conversation and then asking,
p483
aV"What are we going to replace Trump with?"
p484
aa(lp485
VGC: But you saw fighting last night, even at the speech,
p486
aVbecause you saw the Democratic women who came and wore white
p487
aVto honor the suffragette movement.
p488
aVI remember back during the campaign
p489
aVwhere some Trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment
p490
aVthat allowed us to vote as women.
p491
aVIt was like, what?
p492
aVSo I don't know if that's the right way to fight.
p493
aVIt was interesting, because I was looking in the audience,
p494
aVtrying to see Democratic women who didn't wear white.
p495
aVSo there's a lot going on there,
p496
aVand there's a lot of ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that.
p497
aa(lp498
VCA: I mean, one of the key questions, to me, is:
p499
aVThe people who voted for Trump but, if you like, are more in the center,
p500
aVlike they're possibly amenable to persuasion \u2014
p501
aVare they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate uprising
p502
aVof people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!"
p503
aVor will that actually piss them off and push them away?
p504
aa(lp505
VDB: How are any of us persuaded?
p506
aVAm I going to persuade you by saying, "Well, you're kind of a bigot,
p507
aVyou're supporting bigotry, you're supporting sexism.
p508
aVYou're a primitive, fascistic rise from some authoritarian past"?
p509
aVThat's probably not going to be too persuasive to you.
p510
aVAnd so the way any of us are persuaded is by:
p511
aVa) some basic show of respect for the point of view, and saying,
p512
aV"I think this guy is not going to get you where you need to go."
p513
aVAnd there are two phrases you've heard over and over again,
p514
aVwherever you go in the country.
p515
aVOne, the phrase "flyover country."
p516
aVAnd that's been heard for years,
p517
aVbut I would say this year, I heard it almost on an hourly basis,
p518
aVa sense of feeling invisible.
p519
aVAnd then the sense a sense of the phrase "political correctness."
p520
aVJust that rebellion: "They're not even letting us say what we think."
p521
aVAnd I teach at Yale.
p522
aVThe narrowing of debate is real.
p523
aa(lp524
VCA: So you would say this is a trap that liberals have fallen into
p525
aVby celebrating causes they really believe in,
p526
aVoften expressed through the language of "political correctness."
p527
aVThey have done damage. They have pushed people away.
p528
aa(lp529
VDB: I would say a lot of the argument, though,
p530
aVwith "descent to fascism," "authoritarianism" \u2014
p531
aVthat just feels over-the-top to people.
p532
aVAnd listen, I've written eight million anti-Trump columns,
p533
aVbut it is a problem, especially for the coastal media,
p534
aVthat every time he does something slightly wrong, we go to 11,
p535
aVand we're at 11 every day.
p536
aVAnd it just strains credibility at some point.
p537
aa(lp538
VCA: Crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early.
p539
aVBut there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf.
p540
aa(lp541
VGC: But see \u2014 one of the most important things to me
p542
aVis how the conservative media handles Trump.
p543
aVWill they call him out when things are not true,
p544
aVor will they just go along with it?
p545
aVTo me, that is what is essential in this entire discussion,
p546
aVbecause when you have followers of somebody
p547
aVwho don't really care if he tells the truth or not,
p548
aVthat can be very dangerous.
p549
aVSo to me, it's: How is the conservative media going to respond to it?
p550
aVI mean, you've been calling them out.
p551
aVBut how will other forms of conservative media deal with that
p552
aVas we move forward?
p553
aa(lp554
VDB: It's all shifted, though.
p555
aVThe conservative media used to be Fox or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.
p556
aVThey're no longer the conservative media.
p557
aVNow there's another whole set of institutions further right,
p558
aVwhich is Breitbart and Infowars, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,
p559
aVand so they're the ones who are now his base, not even so much Fox.
p560
aa(lp561
VCA: My last question for the time being is just on this question of the truth.
p562
aVI mean, it's one of the scariest things to people right now,
p563
aVthat there is no agreement, nationally, on what is true.
p564
aVI've never seen anything like it,
p565
aVwhere facts are so massively disputed.
p566
aVYour whole newspaper, sir, is delivering fake news every day.
p567
aa(lp568
VDB: And failing.
p569
aa(lp570
V(Laughter)
p571
aa(lp572
VCA: And failing. My commiserations.
p573
aVBut is there any path
p574
aVwhereby we can start to get some kind of consensus,
p575
aVto believe the same things?
p576
aVCan online communities play a role here?
p577
aVHow do we fix this?
p578
aa(lp579
VGC: See, I understand how that happened.
p580
aVThat's another groundswell kind of emotion
p581
aVthat was going on in the middle of America
p582
aVand not being heard,
p583
aVin thinking that the mainstream media was biased.
p584
aVThere's a difference, though, between being biased and being fake.
p585
aVTo me, that is a very important distinction in this conversation.
p586
aVSo let's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media.
p587
aVOK. So there are ways to try and mend that.
p588
aVBut what Trump's doing is nuclearizing that and saying,
p589
aV"Look, we're just going to call all of that fake."
p590
aVThat's where it gets dangerous.
p591
aa(lp592
VCA: Do you think enough of his supporters
p593
aVhave a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ...
p594
aVLike, the principle of not supporting something
p595
aVthat is demonstrably not true
p596
aVactually matters, so there will be a correction at some point?
p597
aa(lp598
VDB: I think the truth eventually comes out.
p599
aVSo for example, Donald Trump has based a lot of his economic policy
p600
aVon this supposition that Americans have lost manufacturing jobs
p601
aVbecause they've been stolen by the Chinese.
p602
aVThat is maybe 13 percent of the jobs that left.
p603
aVThe truth is that 87 percent of the jobs were replaced by technology.
p604
aVThat is just the truth.
p605
aVAnd so as a result, when he says,
p606
aV"I'm going to close TPP and all the jobs will come roaring back,"
p607
aVthey will not come roaring back.
p608
aVSo that is an actual fact, in my belief.
p609
aVAnd \u2014
p610
aa(lp611
V(Laughter)
p612
aa(lp613
VGC: But I'm saying what his supporters think is the truth,
p614
aVno matter how many times you might say that,
p615
aVthey still believe him.
p616
aa(lp617
VDB: But eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back,
p618
aVand at that point, either something will work or it doesn't work,
p619
aVand it doesn't work or not work because of great marketing,
p620
aVit works because it actually addresses a real problem
p621
aVand so I happen to think the truth will out.
p622
aa(lp623
VCA: If you've got a question, please raise your hand here.
p624
aa(lp625
VYael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.
p626
aVMy name's Yael Eisenstat.
p627
aVI hear a lot of this talk
p628
aVabout how we all need to start talking to each other more
p629
aVand understanding each other more,
p630
aVand I've even written about this, published on this subject as well,
p631
aVbut now today I keep hearing liberals \u2014 yes, I live in New York,
p632
aVI can be considered a liberal \u2014
p633
aVwe sit here and self-analyze:
p634
aVWhat did we do to not understand the Rust Belt?
p635
aVOr: What can we do to understand Middle America better?
p636
aVAnd what I'd like to know:
p637
aVHave you seen any attempts or conversations from Middle America
p638
aVof what can I do to understand the so-called coastal elites better?
p639
aVBecause I'm just offended as being put in a box as a coastal elite
p640
aVas someone in Middle America is as being considered a flyover state
p641
aVand not listened to.
p642
aa(lp643
VCA: There you go, I can hear Facebook cheering as you \u2014
p644
aa(lp645
V(Laughter)
p646
aa(lp647
VDB: I would say \u2014 and this is someone who has been conservative
p648
aVall my adult life \u2014
p649
aVwhen you grow up conservative,
p650
aVyou learn to speak both languages.
p651
aVBecause if I'm going to listen to music,
p652
aVI'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.
p653
aVSo a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left.
p654
aVIf I'm going to go to a school,
p655
aVI'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal.
p656
aVIf I'm going to watch a sitcom
p657
aVor a late-night comedy show, it's going to be liberal.
p658
aVIf I'm going to read a good newspaper, it'll be the New York Times.
p659
aVAs a result, you learn to speak both languages.
p660
aVAnd that actually, at least for a number of years,
p661
aVwhen I started at National Review with William F. Buckley,
p662
aVit made us sharper,
p663
aVbecause we were used to arguing against people every day.
p664
aVThe problem now that's happened is you have ghettoization on the right
p665
aVand you can live entirely in rightworld,
p666
aVso as a result, the quality of argument on the right has diminished,
p667
aVbecause you're not in the other side
p668
aVall the time.
p669
aVBut I do think if you're living in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,
p670
aVthe coastal elites make themselves aware to you,
p671
aVso you know that language as well,
p672
aVbut it's not the reverse.
p673
aa(lp674
VCA: But what does Middle America not get about coastal elites?
p675
aVSo the critique is,
p676
aVyou are not dealing with the real problems.
p677
aVThere's a feeling of a snobbishness, an elitism that is very off-putting.
p678
aVWhat are they missing?
p679
aVIf you could plant one piece of truth
p680
aVfrom the mindset of someone in this room, for example,
p681
aVwhat would you say to them?
p682
aa(lp683
VDB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.
p684
aa(lp685
V(Laughter)
p686
aa(lp687
VNo, I reject the category.
p688
aVThe problem with populism is the same problem with elitism.
p689
aVIt's just a prejudice on the basis
p690
aVof probably an over-generalized  social class distinction
p691
aVwhich is too simplistic to apply in reality.
p692
aVThose of us in New York know there are some people in New York
p693
aVwho are completely awesome, and some people who are pathetic,
p694
aVand if you live in Iowa, some people are awesome and some people are pathetic.
p695
aVIt's not a question of what degree you have
p696
aVor where you happen to live in the country.
p697
aVThe distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power.
p698
aa(lp699
VGC: But I would encourage people to watch a television news show
p700
aVor read a column that they normally wouldn't.
p701
aVSo if you are a Trump supporter, watch the other side for a day,
p702
aVbecause you need to come out of the bubble
p703
aVif you're ever going to have a conversation.
p704
aVAnd both sides \u2014 so if you're a liberal,
p705
aVthen watch something that's very conservative.
p706
aVRead a column that is not something you would normally read,
p707
aVbecause then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking,
p708
aVand to me, that's a start of coming together.
p709
aVI worry about the same thing you worry about, these bubbles.
p710
aVI think if you only watch certain entities,
p711
aVyou have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about.
p712
aa(lp713
VDB: I think not only watching,
p714
aVbeing part of an organization that meets at least once a month
p715
aVthat puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself
p716
aVis something we all have a responsibility for.
p717
aVI may get this a little wrong,
p718
aVbut I think of the top-selling automotive models in this country,
p719
aVI think the top three or four are all pickup trucks.
p720
aVSo ask yourself: How many people do I know who own a pickup truck?
p721
aVAnd it could be very few or zero for a lot of people.
p722
aVAnd that's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem.
p723
aVWhere can I join a club
p724
aVwhere I'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck
p725
aVbecause we have a common interest in whatever?
p726
aa(lp727
VCA: And so the internet is definitely contributing to this.
p728
aVA question here from Chris Ajemian:
p729
aV"How do you feel structure of communications,
p730
aVespecially the prevalence of social media and individualized content,
p731
aVcan be used to bring together a political divide,
p732
aVinstead of just filing communities into echo chambers?"
p733
aVI mean, it looks like Facebook and Google, since the election,
p734
aVare working hard on this question.
p735
aVThey're trying to change the algorithms
p736
aVso that they don't amplify fake news
p737
aVto the extent that it happened last time round.
p738
aVDo you see any other promising signs of ...?
p739
aa(lp740
VGC: ... or amplify one side of the equation.
p741
aa(lp742
VCA: Exactly.
p743
aa(lp744
VGC: I think that was the constant argument from the right,
p745
aVthat social media and the internet in general
p746
aVwas putting articles towards the top that were not their worldview.
p747
aVI think, again, that fed into the anger.
p748
aVIt fed into the anger of:
p749
aV"You're pushing something that's not what I believe."
p750
aVBut social media has obviously changed everything,
p751
aVand I think Trump is the example of Twitter changing absolutely everything.
p752
aVAnd from his point of view,
p753
aVhe's reaching the American people without a filter,
p754
aVwhich he believes the media is.
p755
aa(lp756
VCA: Question from the audience.
p757
aa(lp758
VDestiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.
p759
aVI have a question regarding political correctness, and I'm curious:
p760
aVWhen did political correctness become synonymous with silencing,
p761
aVversus a way that we speak about other people
p762
aVto show them respect and preserve their dignity?
p763
aa(lp764
VGC: Well, I think the conservative media really pounded this issue
p765
aVfor the last 10 years.
p766
aVI think that they really, really spent a lot of time
p767
aVtalking about political correctness,
p768
aVand how people should have the ability to say what they think.
p769
aVAnother reason why Trump became so popular:
p770
aVbecause he says what he thinks.
p771
aVIt also makes me think about the fact
p772
aVthat I do believe there are a lot of people in America
p773
aVwho agree with Steve Bannon,
p774
aVbut they would never say it publicly,
p775
aVand so voting for Trump gave them the opportunity
p776
aVto agree with it silently.
p777
aa(lp778
VDB: On the issue of immigration, it's a legitimate point of view
p779
aVthat we have too many immigrants in the country,
p780
aVthat it's economically costly.
p781
aa(lp782
VCA: That we have too many \u2014
p783
aa(lp784
VDB: Immigrants in the country, especially from Britain.
p785
aa(lp786
V(Laughter)
p787
aa(lp788
VGC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?
p789
aa(lp790
VCA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.
p791
aa(lp792
V(Laughter)
p793
aa(lp794
VI'll go now.
p795
aa(lp796
VDB: But it became sort of impermissible to say that,
p797
aVbecause it was a sign that somehow you must be a bigot of some sort.
p798
aVSo the political correctness was not only cracking down on speech
p799
aVthat we would all find completely offensive,
p800
aVit was cracking down on some speech that was legitimate,
p801
aVand then it was turning speech and thought into action
p802
aVand treating it as a crime,
p803
aVand people getting fired and people thrown out of schools,
p804
aVand there were speech codes written.
p805
aVNow there are these diversity teams,
p806
aVwhere if you say something that somebody finds offensive,
p807
aVlike, "Smoking is really dangerous," you can say "You're insulting my group,"
p808
aVand the team from the administration will come down into your dorm room
p809
aVand put thought police upon you.
p810
aVAnd so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say.
p811
aVAnd some of it is legitimate.
p812
aVThere are certain words that there should be some social sanction against,
p813
aVbut some of it was used to enforce a political agenda.
p814
aa(lp815
VCA: So is that a project
p816
aVyou would urge on liberals, if you like \u2014 progressives \u2014
p817
aVto rethink the ground rules around political correctness
p818
aVand accept a little more uncomfortable language
p819
aVin certain circumstances?
p820
aVCan you see that being solved
p821
aVto an extent that others won't be so offended?
p822
aa(lp823
VDB: I mean, most American universities, especially elite universities,
p824
aVare overwhelmingly on the left,
p825
aVand there's just an ease of temptation
p826
aVto use your overwhelming cultural power to try to enforce some sort of thought
p827
aVthat you think is right and correct thought.
p828
aVSo, be a little more self-suspicious of, are we doing that?
p829
aVAnd second, my university, the University of Chicago,
p830
aVsent out this letter saying, we will have no safe spaces.
p831
aVThere will be no critique of micro-aggression.
p832
aVIf you get your feelings hurt, well, welcome to the world of education.
p833
aVI do think that policy \u2014
p834
aVwhich is being embraced by a lot of people on the left, by the way \u2014
p835
aVis just a corrective to what's happened.
p836
aa(lp837
VCA: So here's a question from Karen Holloway:
p838
aVHow do we foster an American culture
p839
aVthat's forward-looking, like Hamilton,
p840
aVthat expects and deals with change,
p841
aVrather than wanting to have everything go back to some fictional past?
p842
aVThat's an easy question, right?
p843
aa(lp844
VGC: Well, I'm still a believer in the American dream,
p845
aVand I think what we can teach our children is the basics,
p846
aVwhich is that hard work
p847
aVand believing in yourself
p848
aVin America, you can achieve whatever you want.
p849
aVI was told that every single day.
p850
aVWhen I got in the real world, I was like, wow, that's maybe not always so true.
p851
aVBut I still believe in that.
p852
aVMaybe I'm being too optimistic.
p853
aVSo I still look towards the future for that to continue.
p854
aa(lp855
VDB: I think you're being too optimistic.
p856
aa(lp857
VGC: You do?
p858
aa(lp859
VDB: The odds of an American young person exceeding their parents' salary \u2014
p860
aVa generation ago, like 86 percent did it.
p861
aVNow 51 percent do it.
p862
aVThere's just been a problem in social mobility in the country.
p863
aa(lp864
VCA: You've written that this entire century has basically been a disaster,
p865
aVthat the age of sunny growth is over and we're in deep trouble.
p866
aa(lp867
VDB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged, in real terms, population-adjusted,
p868
aVtwo or three percent growth for 50 years,
p869
aVand now we've had less than one percent growth.
p870
aVAnd so there's something seeping out.
p871
aVAnd so if I'm going to tell people that they should take risks,
p872
aVone of the things we're seeing is a rapid decline in mobility,
p873
aVthe number of people who are moving across state lines,
p874
aVand that's especially true among millennials.
p875
aVIt's young people that are moving less.
p876
aVSo how do we give people the security from which they can take risk?
p877
aVAnd I'm a big believer in attachment theory of raising children,
p878
aVand attachment theory is based on the motto
p879
aVthat all of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base.
p880
aVHave you parents given you a secure base?
p881
aVAnd as a society, we do not have a secure base,
p882
aVand we won't get to that "Hamilton," risk-taking, energetic ethos
p883
aVuntil we can supply a secure base.
p884
aa(lp885
VCA: So I wonder whether there's ground here
p886
aVto create almost like a shared agenda, a bridging conversation,
p887
aVon the one hand recognizing that there is this really deep problem
p888
aVthat the system, the economic system that we built,
p889
aVseems to be misfiring right now.
p890
aVSecond, that maybe, if you're right that it's not all about immigrants,
p891
aVit's probably more about technology,
p892
aVif you could win that argument,
p893
aVthat de-emphasizes what seems to me the single most divisive territory
p894
aVbetween Trump supporters and others, which is around the role of the other.
p895
aVIt's very offensive to people on the left to have the other demonized
p896
aVto the extent that the other seems to be demonized.
p897
aVThat feels deeply immoral,
p898
aVand maybe people on the left could agree, as you said,
p899
aVthat immigration may have happened too fast,
p900
aVand there is a limit beyond which human societies struggle,
p901
aVbut nonetheless this whole problem becomes de-emphasized
p902
aVif automation is the key issue,
p903
aVand then we try to work together on recognizing that it's real,
p904
aVrecognizing that the problem probably wasn't properly addressed
p905
aVor seen or heard,
p906
aVand try to figure out how to rebuild communities
p907
aVusing, well, using what?
p908
aVThat seems to me to become the fertile conversation of the future:
p909
aVHow do we rebuild communities in this modern age,
p910
aVwith technology doing what it's doing,
p911
aVand reimagine this bright future?
p912
aa(lp913
VGC: That's why I go back to optimism.
p914
aVI'm not being ... it's not like I'm not looking at the facts,
p915
aVwhere we've come or where we've come from.
p916
aVBut for gosh sakes, if we don't look at it from an optimistic point of view \u2014
p917
aVI'm refusing to do that just yet.
p918
aVI'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old to say, "Look, the world is dim."
p919
aa(lp920
VCA; We're going to have one more question from the room here.
p921
aa(lp922
VQuestioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.
p923
aVYou both mentioned the infrastructure plan and Russia
p924
aVand some other things that wouldn't be traditional Republican priorities.
p925
aVWhat do you think, or when, will Republicans be motivated
p926
aVto take a stand against Trumpism?
p927
aa(lp928
VGC: After last night, not for a while.
p929
aVHe changed a lot last night, I believe.
p930
aa(lp931
VDB: His popularity among Republicans \u2014 he's got 85 percent approval,
p932
aVwhich is higher than Reagan had at this time,
p933
aVand that's because society has just gotten more polarized.
p934
aVSo people follow the party much more than they used to.
p935
aVSo if you're waiting for Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress
p936
aVto flake away,
p937
aVit's going to take a little while.
p938
aa(lp939
VGC: But also because they're all concerned about reelection,
p940
aVand Trump has so much power with getting people either for you
p941
aVor against you,
p942
aVand so, they're vacillating every day, probably:
p943
aV"Well, should I go against or should I not?"
p944
aVBut last night, where he finally sounded presidential,
p945
aVI think most Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief today.
p946
aa(lp947
VDB: The half-life of that is short.
p948
aa(lp949
VGC: Right \u2014 I was just going to say, until Twitter happens again.
p950
aa(lp951
VCA: OK, I want to give each of you the chance
p952
aVto imagine you're speaking to \u2014 I don't know \u2014
p953
aVthe people online who are watching this,
p954
aVwho may be Trump supporters,
p955
aVwho may be on the left, somewhere in the middle.
p956
aVHow would you advise them to bridge or to relate to other people?
p957
aVCan you share any final wisdom on this?
p958
aVOr if you think that they shouldn't, tell them that as well.
p959
aa(lp960
VGC: I would just start by saying
p961
aVthat I really think any change and coming together starts from the top,
p962
aVjust like any other organization.
p963
aVAnd I would love if, somehow,
p964
aVTrump supporters or people on the left could encourage their leaders
p965
aVto show that compassion from the top,
p966
aVbecause imagine the change that we could have
p967
aVif Donald Trump tweeted out today,
p968
aVto all of his supporters,
p969
aV"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.
p970
aVLet's have more understanding.
p971
aVAs a leader, I'm going to be more inclusive
p972
aVto all of the people of America."
p973
aVTo me, it starts at the top.
p974
aVIs he going to do that? I have no idea.
p975
aVBut I think that everything starts from the top,
p976
aVand the power that he has
p977
aVin encouraging his supporters
p978
aVto have an understanding of where people are coming from on the other side.
p979
aa(lp980
VCA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say
p981
aVI don't think we can teach each other to be civil,
p982
aVand give us sermons on civility.
p983
aVThat's not going to do it.
p984
aVIt's substance and how we act,
p985
aVand the nice thing about Donald Trump is he smashed our categories.
p986
aVAll the categories that we thought we were thinking in, they're obsolete.
p987
aVThey were great for the 20th century. They're not good for today.
p988
aVHe's got an agenda which is about closing borders and closing trade.
p989
aVI just don't think it's going to work.
p990
aVI think if we want to rebuild communities, recreate jobs,
p991
aVwe need a different set of agenda
p992
aVthat smashes through all our current divisions and our current categories.
p993
aVFor me, that agenda is Reaganism on macroeconomic policy,
p994
aVSweden on welfare policy
p995
aVand cuts across right and left.
p996
aVI think we have to have a dynamic economy that creates growth.
p997
aVThat's the Reagan on economic policy.
p998
aVBut people have to have that secure base.
p999
aVThere have to be nurse-family partnerships;
p1000
aVthere has to be universal preschool;
p1001
aVthere have to be charter schools;
p1002
aVthere have to be college programs with wraparound programs
p1003
aVfor parents and communities.
p1004
aVWe need to help heal the crisis of social solidarity in this country
p1005
aVand help heal families,
p1006
aVand government just has to get a lot more involved
p1007
aVin the way liberals like to rebuild communities.
p1008
aVAt the other hand, we have to have an economy that's free and open
p1009
aVthe way conservatives used to like.
p1010
aVAnd so getting the substance right is how you smash through
p1011
aVthe partisan identities,
p1012
aVbecause the substance is what ultimately shapes our polarization.
p1013
aa(lp1014
VCA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much
p1015
aVfor an absolutely fascinating conversation.
p1016
aVThank you. That was really, really interesting.
p1017
aa(lp1018

p1019
aa(lp1020
VHey, let's keep the conversation going.
p1021
aVWe're continuing to try and figure out
p1022
aVwhether we can add something here,
p1023
aVso keep the conversation going on Facebook.
p1024
aVGive us your thoughts from whatever part of the political spectrum you're on,
p1025
aVand actually, wherever in the world you are.
p1026
aVThis is not just about America. It's about the world, too.
p1027
aVBut we're not going to end today without music,
p1028
aVbecause if we put music in every political conversation,
p1029
aVthe world would be completely different, frankly.
p1030
aVIt just would.
