VWhat I thought I would do
p4
aVis I would start with a simple request.
p5
aVI'd like all of you
p6
aVto pause for a moment,
p7
aVyou wretched weaklings,
p8
aVand take stock of your miserable existence.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VNow that was the advice
p12
aVthat St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers
p13
aVin the fifth century.
p14
aVIt was the advice that I decided to follow myself
p15
aVwhen I turned 40.
p16
aVUp until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior \u2014
p17
aVI was eating too much, I was drinking too much,
p18
aVI was working too hard
p19
aVand I was neglecting the family.
p20
aVAnd I decided that I would try
p21
aVand turn my life around.
p22
aVIn particular, I decided
p23
aVI would try to address the thorny issue
p24
aVof work-life balance.
p25
aVSo I stepped back from the workforce,
p26
aVand I spent a year at home
p27
aVwith my wife and four young children.
p28
aVBut all I learned about work-life balance
p29
aVfrom that year
p30
aVwas that I found it quite easy
p31
aVto balance work and life
p32
aVwhen I didn't have any work.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVNot a very useful skill,
p35
aVespecially when the money runs out.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I went back to work,
p38
aVand I've spent these seven years since
p39
aVstruggling with, studying
p40
aVand writing about work-life balance.
p41
aVAnd I have four observations
p42
aVI'd like to share with you today.
p43
aVThe first is:
p44
aVif society's to make any progress on this issue,
p45
aVwe need an honest debate.
p46
aVBut the trouble is
p47
aVso many people talk so much rubbish
p48
aVabout work-life balance.
p49
aVAll the discussions about flexi-time
p50
aVor dress-down Fridays
p51
aVor paternity leave
p52
aVonly serve to mask the core issue,
p53
aVwhich is
p54
aVthat certain job and career choices
p55
aVare fundamentally incompatible
p56
aVwith being meaningfully engaged
p57
aVon a day-to-day basis
p58
aVwith a young family.
p59
aVNow the first step in solving any problem
p60
aVis acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.
p61
aVAnd the reality of the society that we're in
p62
aVis there are thousands and thousands
p63
aVof people out there
p64
aVleading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,
p65
aVwhere they work long, hard hours
p66
aVat jobs they hate
p67
aVto enable them to buy things they don't need
p68
aVto impress people they don't like.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aV(Applause)
p71
aVIt's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt
p72
aVisn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VThe second observation I'd like to make
p77
aVis we need to face the truth
p78
aVthat governments and corporations
p79
aVaren't going to solve this issue for us.
p80
aVWe should stop looking outside.
p81
aVIt's up to us as individuals
p82
aVto take control and responsibility
p83
aVfor the type of lives that we want to lead.
p84
aVIf you don't design your life,
p85
aVsomeone else will design it for you,
p86
aVand you may just not like
p87
aVtheir idea of balance.
p88
aVIt's particularly important \u2014
p89
aVthis isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired \u2014
p90
aVit's particularly important
p91
aVthat you never put the quality of your life
p92
aVin the hands of a commercial corporation.
p93
aVNow I'm not talking here just about the bad companies \u2014
p94
aVthe "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVI'm talking about all companies.
p97
aVBecause commercial companies
p98
aVare inherently designed
p99
aVto get as much out of you [as]
p100
aVthey can get away with.
p101
aVIt's in their nature; it's in their DNA;
p102
aVit's what they do \u2014
p103
aVeven the good, well-intentioned companies.
p104
aVOn the one hand,
p105
aVputting childcare facilities in the workplace
p106
aVis wonderful and enlightened.
p107
aVOn the other hand, it's a nightmare \u2014
p108
aVit just means you spend more time at the bloody office.
p109
aVWe have to be responsible
p110
aVfor setting and enforcing
p111
aVthe boundaries that we want in our life.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe third observation is
p114
aVwe have to be careful
p115
aVwith the time frame that we choose
p116
aVupon which to judge our balance.
p117
aVBefore I went back to work
p118
aVafter my year at home,
p119
aVI sat down
p120
aVand I wrote out
p121
aVa detailed, step-by-step description
p122
aVof the ideal balanced day
p123
aVthat I aspired to.
p124
aVAnd it went like this:
p125
aVwake up well rested
p126
aVafter a good night's sleep.
p127
aVHave sex.
p128
aVWalk the dog.
p129
aVHave breakfast with my wife and children.
p130
aVHave sex again.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVDrive the kids to school on the way to the office.
p133
aVDo three hours' work.
p134
aVPlay a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
p135
aVDo another three hours' work.
p136
aVMeet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.
p137
aVDrive home for dinner
p138
aVwith my wife and kids.
p139
aVMeditate for half an hour.
p140
aVHave sex.
p141
aVWalk the dog. Have sex again.
p142
aVGo to bed.
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVHow often do you think I have that day?
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVWe need to be realistic.
p147
aVYou can't do it all in one day.
p148
aVWe need to elongate the time frame
p149
aVupon which we judge the balance in our life,
p150
aVbut we need to elongate it
p151
aVwithout falling into the trap
p152
aVof the "I'll have a life when I retire,
p153
aVwhen my kids have left home,
p154
aVwhen my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,
p155
aVI've got no mates or interests left."
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVA day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.
p158
aVThere's got to be a middle way.
p159
aa(lp160
VA fourth observation:
p161
aVWe need to approach balance
p162
aVin a balanced way.
p163
aVA friend came to see me last year \u2014
p164
aVand she doesn't mind me telling this story \u2014 a friend came to see me last year
p165
aVand said, "Nigel, I've read your book.
p166
aVAnd I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
p167
aVIt's totally dominated by work.
p168
aVI work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.
p169
aVAll of my relationships have failed.
p170
aVThere's nothing in my life
p171
aVapart from my work.
p172
aVSo I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.
p173
aVSo I joined a gym."
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVNow I don't mean to mock,
p176
aVbut being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat
p177
aVisn't more balanced; it's more fit.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVLovely though physical exercise may be,
p180
aVthere are other parts to life \u2014
p181
aVthere's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;
p182
aVthere's the spiritual side.
p183
aVAnd to be balanced,
p184
aVI believe we have to attend
p185
aVto all of those areas \u2014
p186
aVnot just do 50 stomach crunches.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow that can be daunting.
p189
aVBecause people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.
p190
aVYou want me to go to church and call my mother."
p191
aVAnd I understand.
p192
aVI truly understand how that can be daunting.
p193
aVBut an incident that happened a couple of years ago
p194
aVgave me a new perspective.
p195
aVMy wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,
p196
aVcalled me up at the office
p197
aVand said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" \u2014
p198
aVHarry \u2014 "up from school."
p199
aVBecause she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.
p200
aVSo I left work an hour early that afternoon
p201
aVand picked Harry up at the school gates.
p202
aVWe walked down to the local park,
p203
aVmessed around on the swings, played some silly games.
p204
aVI then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,
p205
aVand we shared a pizza for two,
p206
aVthen walked down the hill to our home,
p207
aVand I gave him his bath
p208
aVand put him in his Batman pajamas.
p209
aVI then read him a chapter
p210
aVof Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."
p211
aVI then put him to bed, tucked him in,
p212
aVgave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"
p213
aVand walked out of his bedroom.
p214
aVAs I was walking out of his bedroom,
p215
aVhe said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"
p216
aVHe went, "Dad, this has been the best day
p217
aVof my life, ever."
p218
aVI hadn't done anything,
p219
aVhadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow my point is
p222
aVthe small things matter.
p223
aVBeing more balanced
p224
aVdoesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.
p225
aVWith the smallest investment
p226
aVin the right places,
p227
aVyou can radically transform the quality of your relationships
p228
aVand the quality of your life.
p229
aVMoreover, I think,
p230
aVit can transform society.
p231
aVBecause if enough people do it,
p232
aVwe can change society's definition of success
p233
aVaway from the moronically simplistic notion
p234
aVthat the person with the most money when he dies wins,
p235
aVto a more thoughtful and balanced definition
p236
aVof what a life well lived looks like.
p237
aVAnd that, I think,
p238
aVis an idea worth spreading.
