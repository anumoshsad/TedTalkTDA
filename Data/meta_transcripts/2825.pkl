VThat's SpotMini.
p8
aVHe'll be back in a little while.
p9
aa(lp10
VI \u2014
p11
aa(lp12
V(Applause)
p13
aa(lp14
VI love building robots.
p15
aVAnd my long-term goal is to build robots
p16
aVthat can do what people and animals do.
p17
aVAnd there's three things in particular
p18
aVthat we're interested in.
p19
aVOne is balance and dynamic mobility,
p20
aVthe second one is mobile manipulation,
p21
aVand the third one is mobile perception.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, dynamic mobility and balance \u2014
p24
aVI'm going to do a demo for you.
p25
aVI'm standing here, balancing.
p26
aVI can see you're not very impressed. OK, how about now?
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VHow about now?
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VThose simple capabilities mean that people can go almost anywhere on earth,
p35
aVon any kind of terrain.
p36
aVWe want to capture that for robots.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhat about manipulation?
p39
aVI'm holding this clicker in my hand;
p40
aVI'm not even looking at it,
p41
aVand I can manipulate it without any problem.
p42
aVBut even more important,
p43
aVI can move my body while I hold the manipulator, the clicker,
p44
aVand stabilize and coordinate my body,
p45
aVand I can even walk around.
p46
aVAnd that means I can move around in the world
p47
aVand expand the range of my arms and my hands
p48
aVand really be able to handle almost anything.
p49
aVSo that's mobile manipulation.
p50
aVAnd all of you can do this.
p51
aa(lp52
VThird is perception.
p53
aVI'm looking at a room with over 1,000 people in it,
p54
aVand my amazing visual system can see every one of you \u2014
p55
aVyou're all stable in space,
p56
aVeven when I move my head,
p57
aVeven when I move around.
p58
aVThat kind of mobile perception is really important for robots
p59
aVthat are going to move and act
p60
aVout in the world.
p61
aa(lp62
VI'm going to give you a little status report
p63
aVon where we are in developing robots toward these ends.
p64
aVThe first three robots are all dynamically stabilized robots.
p65
aVThis one goes back a little over 10 years ago \u2014
p66
aV"BigDog."
p67
aVIt's got a gyroscope that helps stabilize it.
p68
aVIt's got sensors and a control computer.
p69
aa(lp70
VHere's a Cheetah robot that's running with a galloping gait,
p71
aVwhere it recycles its energy,
p72
aVit bounces on the ground,
p73
aVand it's computing all the time
p74
aVin order to keep itself stabilized and propelled.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd here's a bigger robot
p77
aVthat's got such good locomotion using its legs,
p78
aVthat it can go in deep snow.
p79
aVThis is about 10 inches deep,
p80
aVand it doesn't really have any trouble.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis is Spot, a new generation of robot \u2014
p83
aVjust slightly older than the one that came out onstage.
p84
aVAnd we've been asking the question \u2014
p85
aVyou've all heard about drone delivery:
p86
aVCan we deliver packages to your houses with drones?
p87
aVWell, what about plain old legged-robot delivery?
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VSo we've been taking our robot to our employees' homes
p92
aVto see whether we could get in \u2014
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
Vthe various access ways.
p97
aVAnd believe me, in the Boston area,
p98
aVthere's every manner of stairway twists and turns.
p99
aVSo it's a real challenge.
p100
aVBut we're doing very well, about 70 percent of the way.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd here's mobile manipulation,
p103
aVwhere we've put an arm on the robot,
p104
aVand it's finding its way through the door.
p105
aVNow, one of the important things about making autonomous robots
p106
aVis to make them not do just exactly what you say,
p107
aVbut make them deal with the uncertainty of what happens in the real world.
p108
aVSo we have Steve there, one of the engineers,
p109
aVgiving the robot a hard time.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd the fact that the programming still tolerates all that disturbance \u2014
p114
aVit does what it's supposed to.
p115
aa(lp116
VHere's another example, where Eric is tugging on the robot
p117
aVas it goes up the stairs.
p118
aVAnd believe me,
p119
aVgetting it to do what it's supposed to do in those circumstances
p120
aVis a real challenge,
p121
aVbut the result is something that's going to generalize
p122
aVand make robots much more autonomous than they would be otherwise.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is Atlas, a humanoid robot.
p125
aVIt's a third-generation humanoid that we've been building.
p126
aVI'll tell you a little bit about the hardware design later.
p127
aVAnd we've been saying:
p128
aVHow close to human levels of performance and speed could we get
p129
aVin an ordinary task,
p130
aVlike moving boxes around on a conveyor?
p131
aVWe're getting up to about two-thirds of the speed that a human operates
p132
aVon average.
p133
aVAnd this robot is using both hands, it's using its body,
p134
aVit's stepping,
p135
aVso it's really an example of dynamic stability,
p136
aVmobile manipulation
p137
aVand mobile perception.
p138
aVHere \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VWe actually have two Atlases.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, everything doesn't go exactly the way it's supposed to.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd here's our latest robot, called "Handle."
p155
aVHandle is interesting, because it's sort of half like an animal,
p156
aVand it's half something else
p157
aVwith these leg-like things and wheels.
p158
aVIt's got its arms on in kind of a funny way,
p159
aVbut it really does some remarkable things.
p160
aVIt can carry 100 pounds.
p161
aVIt's probably going to lift more than that,
p162
aVbut so far we've done 100.
p163
aVIt's got some pretty good rough-terrain capability,
p164
aVeven though it has wheels.
p165
aVAnd Handle loves to put on a show.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VI'm going to give you a little bit of robot religion.
p172
aVA lot of people think that a robot is a machine where there's a computer
p173
aVthat's telling it what to do,
p174
aVand the computer is listening through its sensors.
p175
aVBut that's really only half of the story.
p176
aVThe real story is that the computer is on one side,
p177
aVmaking suggestions to the robot,
p178
aVand on the other side are the physics of the world.
p179
aVAnd that physics involves gravity, friction, bouncing into things.
p180
aVIn order to have a successful robot,
p181
aVmy religion is that you have to do a holistic design,
p182
aVwhere you're designing the software, the hardware and the behavior
p183
aVall at one time,
p184
aVand all these parts really intermesh and cooperate with each other.
p185
aVAnd when you get the perfect design, you get a real harmony
p186
aVbetween all those parts interacting with each other.
p187
aVSo it's half software and half hardware,
p188
aVplus the behavior.
p189
aa(lp190
VWe've done some work lately on the hardware, where we tried to go \u2014
p191
aVthe picture on the left is a conventional design,
p192
aVwhere you have parts that are all bolted together,
p193
aVconductors, tubes, connectors.
p194
aVAnd on the right is a more integrated thing;
p195
aVit's supposed to look like an anatomy drawing.
p196
aVUsing the miracle of 3-D printing,
p197
aVwe're starting to build parts of robots
p198
aVthat look a lot more like the anatomy of an animal.
p199
aVSo that's an upper-leg part that has hydraulic pathways \u2014
p200
aVactuators, filters \u2014
p201
aVall embedded, all printed as one piece,
p202
aVand the whole structure is developed
p203
aVwith a knowledge of what the loads and behavior are going to be,
p204
aVwhich is available from data recorded from robots
p205
aVand simulations and things like that.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo it's a data-driven hardware design.
p208
aVAnd using processes like that,
p209
aVnot only the upper leg but some other things,
p210
aVwe've gotten our robots to go from big, behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots \u2014
p211
aVthat one on the right, weighing almost 400 pounds \u2014
p212
aVdown to the one in the middle which was just in the video,
p213
aVweighs about 190 pounds,
p214
aVjust a little bit more than me,
p215
aVand we have a new one,
p216
aVwhich is working but I'm not going to show it to you yet,
p217
aVon the left,
p218
aVwhich weighs just 165 pounds,
p219
aVwith all the same strength and capabilities.
p220
aVSo these things are really getting better very quickly.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo it's time for Spot to come back out,
p223
aVand we're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility,
p224
aVdexterity and perception.
p225
aVThis is Seth Davis, who's my robot wrangler today,
p226
aVand he's giving Spot some general direction
p227
aVby steering it around,
p228
aVbut all the coordination of the legs and the sensors
p229
aVis done by the robot's computers on board.
p230
aVThe robot can walk with a number of different gaits;
p231
aVit's got a gyro,
p232
aVor a solid-state gyro,
p233
aVan IMU on board.
p234
aVObviously, it's got a battery, and things like that.
p235
aVOne of the cool things about a legged robot is,
p236
aVit's omnidirectional.
p237
aVIn addition to going forward, it can go sideways,
p238
aVit can turn in place.
p239
aVAnd this robot is a little bit of a show-off.
p240
aVIt loves to use its dynamic gaits,
p241
aVlike running \u2014
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd it's got one more.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VNow if it were really a show-off, it would be hopping on one foot,
p250
aVbut, you know.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow, Spot has a set of cameras here, stereo cameras,
p253
aVand we have a feed up in the center.
p254
aVIt's kind of dark out in the audience,
p255
aVbut it's going to use those cameras in order to look at the terrain
p256
aVright in front of it,
p257
aVwhile it goes over these obstacles back here.
p258
aVFor this demo, Seth is steering,
p259
aVbut the robot's doing all its own terrain planning.
p260
aVThis is a terrain map,
p261
aVwhere the data from the cameras is being developed in real time,
p262
aVshowing the red spots, which are where it doesn't want to step,
p263
aVand the green spots are the good places.
p264
aVAnd here it's treating them like stepping-stones.
p265
aVSo it's trying to stay up on the blocks,
p266
aVand it adjusts its stride,
p267
aVand there's a ton of planning
p268
aVthat has to go into an operation like that,
p269
aVand it does all that planning in real time,
p270
aVwhere it adjusts the steps a little bit longer
p271
aVor a little bit shorter.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow we're going to change it into a different mode,
p274
aVwhere it's just going to treat the blocks like terrain
p275
aVand decide whether to step up or down
p276
aVas it goes.
p277
aVSo this is using dynamic balance
p278
aVand mobile perception,
p279
aVbecause it has to coordinate what it sees along with how it's moving.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe other thing Spot has is a robot arm.
p282
aVSome of you may see that as a head and a neck,
p283
aVbut believe me, it's an arm.
p284
aVSeth is driving it around.
p285
aVHe's actually driving the hand and the body is following.
p286
aVSo the two are coordinated in the way I was talking about before \u2014
p287
aVin the way people can do that.
p288
aVIn fact, one of the cool things Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,"
p289
aVand it keeps its head in one place in space,
p290
aVand it moves its body all around.
p291
aVThere's a variation of this that's called "twerking" \u2014
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
Vbut we're not going to use that today.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VSo, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty. Could you get me a soda?
p300
aVFor this demo, Seth is not doing any driving.
p301
aVWe have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,
p302
aVand it's using these props we've put on the stage
p303
aVto localize itself.
p304
aVIt's gone over to that location.
p305
aVNow it's using a camera that's in its hand
p306
aVto find the cup,
p307
aVpicks it up \u2014
p308
aVand again, Seth's not driving.
p309
aVWe've planned out a path for it to go \u2014
p310
aVit looked like it was going off the path \u2014
p311
aVand now Seth's going to take over control again,
p312
aVbecause I'm a little bit chicken about having it do this by itself.
p313
aVThank you, Spot.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VSo, Spot:
p318
aVHow do you feel about having just finished your TED performance?
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VMe, too!
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VThank you all,
p327
aVand thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,
p328
aVwho did all the hard work behind this.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VHelen Walters: Marc, come back in the middle.
p333
aVThank you so much.
p334
aVCome over here, I have questions.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo, you mentioned the UPS and the package delivery.
p337
aVWhat are the other applications that you see for your robots?
p338
aa(lp339
VMarc Raibert: You know, I think that robots
p340
aVthat have the capabilities I've been talking about
p341
aVare going to be incredibly useful.
p342
aVAbout a year ago, I went to Fukushima
p343
aVto see what the situation was there,
p344
aVand there's just a huge need
p345
aVfor machines that can go into some of the dirty places
p346
aVand help remediate that.
p347
aa(lp348
VI think it won't be too long until we have robots like this in our homes,
p349
aVand one of the big needs is to take care of the aging
p350
aVand invalids.
p351
aVI think that it won't be too long till we're using robots
p352
aVto help take care of our parents,
p353
aVor probably more likely, have our children help take care of us.
p354
aVAnd there's a bunch of other things.
p355
aVI think the sky's the limit.
p356
aVMany of the ideas we haven't thought of yet,
p357
aVand people like you will help us think of new applications.
p358
aa(lp359
VHW: So what about the dark side?
p360
aVWhat about the military?
p361
aVAre they interested?
p362
aa(lp363
VMR: Sure, the military has been a big funder of robotics.
p364
aVI don't think the military is the dark side myself,
p365
aVbut I think, as with all advanced technology,
p366
aVit can be used for all kinds of things.
p367
aa(lp368
VHW: Awesome. Thank you so much.
p369
aa(lp370
VMR: OK, you're welcome.
p371
aa(lp372
VThank you.
