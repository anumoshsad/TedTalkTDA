VI'm driven by pure passion
p4
aVto create photographs that tell stories.
p5
aVPhotography can be described as the recording of a single moment
p6
aVfrozen within a fraction of time.
p7
aVEach moment or photograph represents a tangible piece
p8
aVof our memories as time passes.
p9
aVBut what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
p10
aVWhat if a photograph could actually collapse time,
p11
aVcompressing the best moments of the day and the night
p12
aVseamlessly into one single image?
p13
aa(lp14
VI've created a concept called "Day to Night"
p15
aVand I believe it's going to change
p16
aVthe way you look at the world.
p17
aVI know it has for me.
p18
aa(lp19
VMy process begins by photographing iconic locations,
p20
aVplaces that are part of what I call our collective memory.
p21
aVI photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
p22
aVI capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.
p23
aVPhotographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours
p24
aVand shooting over 1,500 images,
p25
aVI then choose the best moments of the day and night.
p26
aa(lp27
VUsing time as a guide,
p28
aVI seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph,
p29
aVvisualizing our conscious journey with time.
p30
aVI can take you to Paris
p31
aVfor a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
p32
aVAnd I can show you the early morning rowers
p33
aValong the River Seine.
p34
aVAnd simultaneously,
p35
aVI can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
p36
aVAnd in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.
p37
aa(lp38
VI am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air,
p39
aVand every single thing you see in this photograph
p40
aVactually happened on this day.
p41
aa(lp42
VDay to Night is a global project,
p43
aVand my work has always been about history.
p44
aVI'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice
p45
aVand actually seeing it during a specific event.
p46
aVAnd I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata,
p47
aVan event that's actually been taking place since 1498.
p48
aVThe boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
p49
aVAnd an important element that I really want you guys to understand is:
p50
aVthis is not a timelapse,
p51
aVthis is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
p52
aVI am a relentless collector of magical moments.
p53
aVAnd the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe entire concept came about in 1996.
p56
aVLIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph
p57
aVof the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
p58
aVI got to the set and realized: it's a square.
p59
aVSo the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage
p60
aVof 250 single images.
p61
aVSo I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.
p62
aVAnd as I pan my camera to the right,
p63
aVI noticed there was a mirror on the wall
p64
aVand I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
p65
aVAnd for that one moment, that one image
p66
aVI asked them, "Would you guys just kiss
p67
aVfor this one picture?"
p68
aVAnd then I came back to my studio in New York,
p69
aVand I hand-glued these 250 images together
p70
aVand stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
p71
aVI'm changing time in a photograph."
p72
aVAnd that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years
p73
aVuntil technology finally has caught up to my dreams.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
p76
aVAnd I'm going to show you a little video
p77
aVthat gives you an idea of what it's like being with me
p78
aVwhen I do these pictures.
p79
aVTo start with, you have to understand that to get views like this,
p80
aVmost of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker
p81
aVor a crane.
p82
aVSo this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop
p83
aVcapturing the entire day unfold.
p84
aa(lp85
VOne of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
p86
aVAnd trust me when I tell you,
p87
aVthis is the greatest seat in the house to have.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
p90
aVSo once I decide on my view and the location,
p91
aVI have to decide where day begins and night ends.
p92
aVAnd that's what I call the time vector.
p93
aVEinstein described time as a fabric.
p94
aVThink of the surface of a trampoline:
p95
aVit warps and stretches with gravity.
p96
aVI see time as a fabric as well,
p97
aVexcept I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.
p98
aa(lp99
VOne of the unique aspects of this work is also,
p100
aVif you look at all my pictures,
p101
aVthe time vector changes:
p102
aVsometimes I'll go left to right,
p103
aVsometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
p104
aVI am exploring the space-time continuum
p105
aVwithin a two-dimensional still photograph.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow when I do these pictures,
p108
aVit's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
p109
aVI build a photograph based on time,
p110
aVand this is what I call the master plate.
p111
aVThis can take us several months to complete.
p112
aVThe fun thing about this work is
p113
aVI have absolutely zero control when I get up there
p114
aVon any given day and capture photographs.
p115
aVSo I never know who's going to be in the picture,
p116
aVif it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset \u2014 no control.
p117
aVIt's at the end of the process,
p118
aVif I've had a really great day and everything remained the same,
p119
aVthat I then decide who's in and who's out,
p120
aVand it's all based on time.
p121
aVI'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing
p122
aVand they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.
p123
aVI'm compressing the day and night
p124
aVas I saw it,
p125
aVcreating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.
p126
aa(lp127
VPainting has always been a really important influence in all my work
p128
aVand I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt,
p129
aVthe great Hudson River School painter.
p130
aVHe inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
p131
aVThis is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
p132
aVSo this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
p133
aVThis is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue
p134
aVof National Geographic.
p135
aVI photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
p136
aVI was literally on the side of a cliff,
p137
aVcapturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions,
p138
aVthe moonlight lighting El Capitan.
p139
aVAnd I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
p140
aVThe best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity
p141
aVas time changed \u2014
p142
aVfrom day into night.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd on a personal note,
p145
aVI actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
p146
aVAnd when that sun started to rise in the valley,
p147
aVI started to literally shake with excitement
p148
aVbecause I looked at the painting and I go,
p149
aV"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting
p150
aV100 years earlier."
p151
aa(lp152
VDay to Night is about all the things,
p153
aVit's like a compilation of all the things I love
p154
aVabout the medium of photography.
p155
aVIt's about landscape,
p156
aVit's about street photography,
p157
aVit's about color, it's about architecture,
p158
aVperspective, scale \u2014 and, especially, history.
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is one of the most historical moments
p161
aVI've been able to photograph,
p162
aVthe 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.
p163
aVAnd if you look closely in this picture,
p164
aVyou can actually see time changing
p165
aVin those large television sets.
p166
aVYou can see Michelle waiting with the children,
p167
aVthe president now greets the crowd,
p168
aVhe takes his oath,
p169
aVand now he's speaking to the people.
p170
aVThere's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.
p171
aVFor this particular photograph,
p172
aVI was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air
p173
aVand it was not very stable.
p174
aVSo every time my assistant and I shifted our weight,
p175
aVour horizon line shifted.
p176
aVSo for every picture you see,
p177
aVand there were about 1,800 in this picture,
p178
aVwe both had to tape our feet into position
p179
aVevery time I clicked the shutter.
p180
aV(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VI've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.
p183
aVI think the two most important are patience
p184
aVand the power of observation.
p185
aVWhen you photograph a city like New York from above,
p186
aVI discovered that those people in cars
p187
aVthat I sort of live with everyday,
p188
aVthey don't look like people in cars anymore.
p189
aVThey feel like a giant school of fish,
p190
aVit was a form of emergent behavior.
p191
aVAnd when people describe the energy of New York,
p192
aVI think this photograph begins to really capture that.
p193
aVWhen you look closer in my work,
p194
aVyou can see there's stories going on.
p195
aVYou realize that Times Square is a canyon,
p196
aVit's shadow and it's sunlight.
p197
aVSo I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.
p198
aVSo wherever the shadows are, it's night
p199
aVand wherever the sun is, it's actually day.
p200
aa(lp201
VTime is this extraordinary thing
p202
aVthat we never can really wrap our heads around.
p203
aVBut in a very unique and special way,
p204
aVI believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.
p205
aVThey embody a new metaphysical visual reality.
p206
aVWhen you spend 15 hours looking at a place,
p207
aVyou're going to see things a little differently
p208
aVthan if you or I walked up with our camera,
p209
aVtook a picture, and then walked away.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis was a perfect example.
p212
aVI call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."
p213
aVI watched over 15 hours
p214
aVall these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
p215
aVThey were more interested in using it as a backdrop.
p216
aVThey would walk up, take a picture,
p217
aVand then walk away.
p218
aVAnd I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example,
p219
aVa powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is
p220
aVversus what the human experience is evolving into.
p221
aVThe act of sharing has suddenly become more important
p222
aVthan the experience itself.
p223
aV(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd finally, my most recent image,
p226
aVwhich has such a special meaning for me personally:
p227
aVthis is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
p228
aVAnd this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera,
p229
aVthis is not a reserve.
p230
aVI went specifically during the peak migration
p231
aVto hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.
p232
aVUnfortunately, when we got there,
p233
aVthere was a drought going on during the peak migration,
p234
aVa five-week drought.
p235
aVSo all the animals were drawn to the water.
p236
aVI found this one watering hole,
p237
aVand felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving,
p238
aVI had a real opportunity to capture something unique.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe spent three days studying it,
p241
aVand nothing could have prepared me
p242
aVfor what I witnessed during our shoot day.
p243
aVI photographed for 26 hours
p244
aVin a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.
p245
aVWhat I witnessed was unimaginable.
p246
aVFrankly, it was Biblical.
p247
aVWe saw, for 26 hours,
p248
aVall these competitive species share a single resource called water.
p249
aVThe same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over
p250
aVduring the next 50 years.
p251
aVThe animals never even grunted at each other.
p252
aVThey seem to understand something that we humans don't.
p253
aVThat this precious resource called water
p254
aVis something we all have to share.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhen I created this picture,
p257
aVI realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing,
p258
aVcompressing time,
p259
aVexploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.
p260
aa(lp261
VAs technology evolves along with photography,
p262
aVphotographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory,
p263
aVbut they will compose a new narrative of untold stories,
p264
aVcreating a timeless window into our world.
p265
