VFrank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
p4
aVDr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,
p5
aVand I realized that I almost became a scientist.
p6
aVWhen I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
p7
aVand I decided to make water.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVSo, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,
p10
aVand I had the two pipes leading into a beaker
p11
aVand I threw a match in.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVAnd the glass \u2014 luckily I turned around \u2014
p14
aVI had it all in my back
p15
aVand I was about 15 feet away.
p16
aVThe wall was covered with ...
p17
aVI had an explosion.
p18
aa(lp19
VRichard Saul Wurman: Really?
p20
aa(lp21
VFG: People on the street came and knocked on the door
p22
aVto see if I was okay.
p23
aVRSW: ... huh. (Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VI'd like to start
p26
aVthis session again.
p27
aVThe gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,
p28
aVFrank Gehry.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aVAnd Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
p32
aVI mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,
p33
aVto become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
p34
aVI mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it
p35
aVbecause it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,
p36
aVbut your building is an icon \u2014
p37
aVyou can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads \u2014
p38
aVand you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status
p39
aVin doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
p40
aVAnd I know the road was extremely difficult.
p41
aVAnd it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,
p42
aVwhatever they were, were very big.
p43
aVYou kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent
p44
aVon working for somebody.
p45
aVBut that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
p46
aVA lot of us work for people;
p47
aVwe're in the hands of other people.
p48
aVAnd that's one of the great dilemmas \u2014 we're in a creativity session \u2014
p49
aVit's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:
p50
aVhow to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
p51
aVAnd you've achieved that
p52
aVand that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
p53
aVIt's not quite a question but you can comment on it.
p54
aVIt's a big issue.
p55
aa(lp56
VFG: Well, I've always just ...
p57
aVI've never really gone out looking for work.
p58
aVI always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
p59
aVAnd when I started out,
p60
aVI thought that architecture was a service business
p61
aVand that you had to please the clients and stuff.
p62
aVAnd I realized when I'd come into the meetings
p63
aVwith these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,
p64
aVand people would just look at me
p65
aVlike I'd just landed from Mars.
p66
aVBut I couldn't do anything else.
p67
aVThat was my response to the people in the time.
p68
aVAnd actually, it was responding to clients that I had
p69
aVwho didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
p70
aVI think it was circumstantial.
p71
aa(lp72
VUntil I got to my house, where the client was my wife.
p73
aVWe bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica
p74
aVand for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
p75
aVAnd a few people got excited about it.
p76
aVI was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,
p77
aVout in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
p78
aVHe's building this huge concrete place.
p79
aVAnd it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
p80
aVWe were standing out in the desert all alone and,
p81
aVthinking about my house, he said,
p82
aV"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,
p83
aVsomewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVSo, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
p86
aVLuckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,
p87
aVso the stuff was a little more permanent.
p88
aVBut I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,
p89
aVthis guy was telling us the other day.
p90
aVSo where do we go now?
p91
aVBack to \u2014 everything's so temporary.
p92
aa(lp93
VI don't see it the way you characterized it.
p94
aVFor me, every day is a new thing.
p95
aVI approach each project with a new insecurity,
p96
aValmost like the first project I ever did,
p97
aVand I get the sweats,
p98
aVI go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going \u2014
p99
aVif I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
p100
aVWhen I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.
p101
aVI discard it.
p102
aVSo I approach it with the same trepidation.
p103
aVObviously, over time I have a lot more confidence
p104
aVthat it's going to be OK.
p105
aVI do run a kind of a business \u2014
p106
aVI've got 120 people
p107
aVand you've got to pay them,
p108
aVso there's a lot of responsibility involved \u2014
p109
aVbut the actual work on the project is with,
p110
aVI think, a healthy insecurity.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd like the playwright said the other day \u2014 I could relate to him:
p113
aVyou're not sure.
p114
aVWhen Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,
p115
aVI saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
p116
aVThey weren't mistakes;
p117
aVI saw everything that I would have changed
p118
aVand I was embarrassed by it.
p119
aVI felt an embarrassment \u2014 "How could I have done that?
p120
aVHow could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
p121
aVIt's taken several years to now look at it detached and say \u2014
p122
aVas you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road
p123
aVand the street, and it appears to have a relationship \u2014
p124
aVthat I started to like it.
p125
aa(lp126
VRSW: What's the status of the New York project?
p127
aa(lp128
VFG: I don't really know.
p129
aVTom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,
p130
aVand I thought he was nuts.
p131
aVI didn't think he knew what he was doing,
p132
aVand he pulled it off.
p133
aVSo, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVHe gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
p136
aVThey're still talking about it.
p137
aVSeptember 11 generated some interest
p138
aVin moving it over to Ground Zero,
p139
aVand I'm totally against that.
p140
aVI just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero
p141
aVI think for a long time.
p142
aa(lp143
VRSW: The picture on the screen,
p144
aVis that Disney?
p145
aa(lp146
VFG: Yeah.
p147
aa(lp148
VRSW: How much further along is it than that,
p149
aVand when will that be finished?
p150
aa(lp151
VFG: That will be finished in 2003 \u2014 September, October \u2014
p152
aVand I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys
p153
aVcome play with us at that place.
p154
aVLuckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
p155
aVRichard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons
p156
aVthat Disney Hall came to me.
p157
aVHe's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
p158
aVThere aren't many people around that are really involved
p159
aVwith architecture as clients.
p160
aVIf you think about the world,
p161
aVand even just in this audience,
p162
aVmost of us are involved with buildings.
p163
aVNothing that you would call architecture, right?
p164
aVAnd so to find one, a guy like that,
p165
aVyou hang on to him.
p166
aVHe's become the head of Art Center,
p167
aVand there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
p168
aVI knew Craig and respected him.
p169
aVThey want to add to it
p170
aVand it's hard to add to a building like that \u2014
p171
aVit's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building \u2014
p172
aVand Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff
p173
aVand it's a lot of acreage.
p174
aVI convinced him to let me bring in another architect
p175
aVfrom Portugal: Alvaro Siza.
p176
aa(lp177
VRSW: Why did you want that?
p178
aa(lp179
VFG: I knew you'd ask that question.
p180
aa(lp181
VIt was intuitive.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAlvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal
p185
aVand is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
p186
aVI visited with him a few years ago
p187
aVand he showed me his early work,
p188
aVand his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
p189
aVWhen I came out of college,
p190
aVI started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,
p191
aVand you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs
p192
aVand things like that.
p193
aVI tried to understand that language as a beginning,
p194
aVas a place to jump off,
p195
aVand there was so much of it being done by spec builders
p196
aVand it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
p197
aVI just stopped.
p198
aVI mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,
p199
aVbut it didn't feel good to me.
p200
aVSiza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal
p201
aVwhere the real stuff was
p202
aVand evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
p203
aVAnd I always felt that he should come to Southern California
p204
aVand do a building.
p205
aVI tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
p206
aVI like the idea of collaboration with people like that
p207
aVbecause it pushes you.
p208
aVI've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,
p209
aVwho doesn't think architecture is art.
p210
aVDid you see that thing?
p211
aVRSW: No. What did he say?
p212
aa(lp213
VFG: He calls architecture "plumbing."
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VFG: Anyway, the Siza thing.
p217
aVIt's a richer experience.
p218
aVIt must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians \u2014
p219
aVit's similar to that I would imagine \u2014
p220
aVwhere you ... huh?
p221
aa(lp222
VAudience: Liquid architecture.
p223
aa(lp224
VFG: Liquid architecture.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVWhere you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,
p227
aVyou play off each other, you make something,
p228
aVthey make something.
p229
aVAnd I think
p230
aVfor me, it's a way of trying to understand the city
p231
aVand what might happen in the city.
p232
aa(lp233
VRSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?
p234
aVOr is it going to be down near ...
p235
aa(lp236
VFG: No, it's near the current campus.
p237
aVAnyway, he's that kind of patron.
p238
aVIt's not his money, of course.
p239
aV(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VRSW: What's his schedule on that?
p242
aa(lp243
VFG: I don't know.
p244
aVWhat's the schedule, Richard?
p245
aVRichard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
p246
aa(lp247
VFG: 2004.
p248
aVYou can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
p249
aVNo, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting
p250
aVbecause it creates chaos, right?
p251
aVEverybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,
p252
aVand if you can figure out how to work off each other \u2014
p253
aVif you can get a bunch of people
p254
aVwho respect each other's work and play off each other,
p255
aVyou might be able to create models for
p256
aVhow to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.
p257
aVLike the Rockefeller Center model,
p258
aVwhich is kind of from another era.
p259
aa(lp260
VRSW: I found the most remarkable thing.
p261
aVMy preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,
p262
aVyou go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
p263
aVI'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
p264
aVThe surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
p265
aVThat was the surprise of going across the river,
p266
aVof going on the highway around it,
p267
aVof walking down the street and finding it.
p268
aVThat was the real surprise of Bilbao.
p269
aa(lp270
VFG: But you know, Richard,
p271
aVmost architects when they present their work \u2014
p272
aVmost of the people we know,
p273
aVyou get up and you talk about your work,
p274
aVand it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy
p275
aVby saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,
p276
aVI'm worried about the city,
p277
aVI'm worried about my client,
p278
aVI worry about budget, that I'm on time."
p279
aVBlah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
p280
aVAnd it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
p281
aVby saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
p282
aVAnd I think everybody \u2014
p283
aVI mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
p284
aVYou're not going to defy gravity.
p285
aVYou've got to work with the building department.
p286
aVIf you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
p287
aVIf it leaks \u2014
p288
aVBilbao did not leak.
p289
aVI was so proud.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVThe MIT project \u2014 they were interviewing me for MIT
p292
aVand they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
p293
aVI met them in Bilbao.
p294
aVThey came for three days.
p295
aa(lp296
VRSW: This is the computer building?
p297
aa(lp298
VFG: Yeah, the computer building.
p299
aVThey were there three days and it rained every day
p300
aVand they kept walking around \u2014
p301
aVI noticed they were looking under things
p302
aVand looking for things,
p303
aVand they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
p304
aVPeople put buckets out ...
p305
aVI was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,
p306
aVit was just fantastic.
p307
aVBut you've got to \u2014
p308
aVyeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VRSW: Frank had a sort of ...
p312
aa(lp313
VFG: Ask Miriam!
p314
aa(lp315
VRW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VFG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,
p319
aVwhen the woman called and said,
p320
aV"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch
p321
aVand the water's pouring in on my head."
p322
aVAnd he said, "Madam, move your chair."
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVSo, some years later I was doing a building,
p325
aVa little house on the beach for Norton Simon,
p326
aVand his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,
p327
aVcalled me and said,
p328
aV"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk
p329
aVand the water's coming in on his head."
p330
aVAnd I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
p331
aa(lp332
VRSW: Didn't get a laugh.
p333
aa(lp334
VFG: No. Not now either.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VBut my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"
p338
aVOK, you solved all the problems,
p339
aVyou did all the stuff, you made nice,
p340
aVyou loved your clients,
p341
aVyou loved the city,
p342
aVyou're a good guy, you're a good person ...
p343
aVand then what?
p344
aVWhat do you bring to it?
p345
aVAnd I think that's what I've always been interested in,
p346
aVis that \u2014 which is a personal kind of expression.
p347
aVBilbao, I think, shows that you can have
p348
aVthat kind of personal expression
p349
aVand still touch all the bases that are necessary
p350
aVof fitting into the city.
p351
aVThat's what reminded me of it.
p352
aVAnd I think that's the issue, you know;
p353
aVit's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects \u2014
p354
aVmost clients aren't hiring architects for that.
p355
aVThey're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,
p356
aVbe polite,
p357
aVand they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
p358
aa(lp359
VRSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people \u2014
p360
aVwhen Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
p361
aa(lp362
VFG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VRSW: Did it leak?
p366
aa(lp367
VFG: No.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VRSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.
p371
aVIs that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
p372
aa(lp373
VFG: Yeah.
p374
aVSince Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,
p375
aVboth Krens and I have been called
p376
aVwith at least 100 opportunities \u2014
p377
aVChina, Brazil, other parts of Spain \u2014
p378
aVto come in and do the Bilbao effect.
p379
aVAnd I've met with some of these people.
p380
aVUsually I say no right away,
p381
aVbut some of them come with pedigree
p382
aVand they sound well-intentioned
p383
aVand they get you for at least one or two meetings.
p384
aVIn one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team
p385
aVbecause the thing was signed with seals and various
p386
aVvery official seals from the city,
p387
aVand that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
p388
aVI asked them what kind of building it was.
p389
aV"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
p390
aVSo four of us went.
p391
aVAnd they took us \u2014 they put us up in a great hotel
p392
aVand we were looking over the bay,
p393
aVand then they took us in a boat out in the water
p394
aVand showed us all these sights in the harbor.
p395
aVEach one was more beautiful than the other.
p396
aVAnd then we were going to have lunch with the mayor
p397
aVand we were going to have dinner with
p398
aVthe most important people in Malaga.
p399
aVJust before going to lunch with the mayor,
p400
aVwe went to the harbor commissioner.
p401
aVIt was a table as long as this carpet
p402
aVand the harbor commissioner was here,
p403
aVand I was here, and my guys.
p404
aVWe sat down, and we had a drink of water
p405
aVand everybody was quiet.
p406
aVAnd the guy looked at me and said,
p407
aV"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
p408
aV(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VRSW: Oh, my God.
p411
aVFG: So, I got up.
p412
aVI said to my team,
p413
aV"Let's get out of here."
p414
aVWe stood up, we walked out.
p415
aVThey followed \u2014 the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,
p416
aV"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
p417
aVI said, "Nope."
p418
aV"You're not going to have dinner at all?"
p419
aVThey just brought us there to hustle this group,
p420
aVyou know, to create a project.
p421
aVAnd we get a lot of that.
p422
aVLuckily, I'm old enough that
p423
aVI can complain I can't travel.
p424
aV(Laughter)
p425
aVI don't have my own plane yet.
p426
aa(lp427
VRSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting
p428
aVbecause it's been very long.
p429
aVBut let me just say a couple words.
p430
aa(lp431
VFG: Can I say something?
p432
aVAre you going to talk about me or you?
p433
aV(Laughter)
p434
aV(Applause)
p435
aa(lp436
VRSW: Once a shit, always a shit!
p437
aa(lp438
VFG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...
p439
aa(lp440
VRSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!
p441
aV(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VI'm going to make it for you!
p444
aa(lp445
