VI was born and raised in Sierra Leone,
p4
aVa small and very beautiful country
p5
aVin West Africa,
p6
aVa country rich both in physical resources
p7
aVand creative talent.
p8
aa(lp9
VHowever, Sierra Leone is infamous
p10
aVfor a decade-long rebel war in the '90s
p11
aVwhen entire villages were burnt down.
p12
aVAn estimated 8,000 men, women and children
p13
aVhad their arms and legs amputated during this time.
p14
aVAs my family and I ran for safety
p15
aVwhen I was about 12 from one of those attacks,
p16
aVI resolved that I would do everything I could
p17
aVto ensure that my own children
p18
aVwould not go through the  same experiences we had.
p19
aVThey would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone
p20
aVwhere war and amputation
p21
aVwere no longer a strategy for gaining power.
p22
aa(lp23
VAs I watched people who I knew, loved ones,
p24
aVrecover from this devastation,
p25
aVone thing that deeply troubled me
p26
aVwas that many of the amputees in the country
p27
aVwould not use their prostheses.
p28
aVThe reason, I would come to find out,
p29
aVwas that their prosthetic sockets
p30
aVwere painful because they did not fit well.
p31
aVThe prosthetic socket is the part
p32
aVin which the amputee inserts their residual limb,
p33
aVand which connects to the prosthetic ankle.
p34
aVEven in the developed world,
p35
aVit takes a period of three weeks to often years
p36
aVfor a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.
p37
aVProsthetists still use conventional processes
p38
aVlike molding and casting
p39
aVto create single-material prosthetic sockets.
p40
aVSuch sockets often leave intolerable amounts
p41
aVof pressure on the limbs of the patient,
p42
aVleaving them with pressure sores and blisters.
p43
aVIt does not matter
p44
aVhow powerful your prosthetic ankle is.
p45
aVIf your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,
p46
aVyou will not use your leg,
p47
aVand that is just simply unacceptable in our age.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr
p50
aVabout two and a half years ago,
p51
aVand he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem,
p52
aVI said, "No, not yet,
p53
aVbut I would love to figure it out."
p54
aVAnd so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,
p55
aVI designed custom prosthetic sockets
p56
aVquickly and cheaply
p57
aVthat are more comfortable
p58
aVthan conventional prostheses.
p59
aVI used magnetic resonance imaging
p60
aVto capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,
p61
aVthen use finite element modeling to better predict
p62
aVthe internal stresses and strains
p63
aVon the normal forces,
p64
aVand then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.
p65
aVWe use a 3D printer to create
p66
aVa multi-material prosthetic socket
p67
aVwhich relieves pressure where needed
p68
aVon the anatomy of the patient.
p69
aVIn short, we're using data
p70
aVto make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.
p71
aVIn a recent trial we just wrapped up
p72
aVat the Media Lab,
p73
aVone of our patients, a U.S. veteran
p74
aVwho has been an amputee for about 20 years
p75
aVand worn dozens of legs,
p76
aVsaid of one of our printed parts,
p77
aV"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,
p78
aVand it's effing sexy."
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VDisability in our age
p82
aVshould not prevent anyone
p83
aVfrom living meaningful lives.
p84
aVMy hope and desire is that the tools and processes
p85
aVwe develop in our research group
p86
aVcan be used to bring highly functional prostheses
p87
aVto those who need them.
p88
aVFor me, a place to begin healing the souls
p89
aVof those affected by war and disease
p90
aVis by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces
p91
aVfor their bodies.
p92
aVWhether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,
p93
aVI hope this not only restores
p94
aVbut indeed transforms their sense of human potential.
p95
