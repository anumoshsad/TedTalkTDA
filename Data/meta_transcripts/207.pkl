VThose of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
p4
aVAnd in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
p5
aVI think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud
p6
aVwhere I can just lie down with my belly down,
p7
aVlike I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
p8
aVAnd I can basically look everywhere I want,
p9
aVsee every movie I've always wanted to see.
p10
aVAnd in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes
p11
aVin the subway in New York when you're reading,
p12
aVthere's something really soothing and easy.
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
p15
aVbecause I discovered ...
p16
aVit took me a while to understand it,
p17
aVbut when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable
p18
aVwith objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
p19
aVAnd I basically live my life in sort of a trance,
p20
aVand I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
p21
aa(lp22
VJust to give you an example:
p23
aVthis is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
p24
aVWe were in Queens,
p25
aVwe were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,
p26
aVso we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
p27
aVThat was one of the funnest moments of my career.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut it's not only that.
p30
aVThe typeface \u2014 the typeface is Helvetica;
p31
aVit's its 50th anniversary this year.
p32
aVAnd so I start thinking \u2014 Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,
p33
aVtrying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface \u2014
p34
aVand the movie starts playing in my head already.
p35
aVAnd of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces
p36
aVit was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
p37
aVAnd I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition
p38
aVis going to have the same effect on you.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
p41
aVyou know when they do homeworks at home?
p42
aVInstead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go
p43
aVinto the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag
p44
aVand do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,
p47
aVand at MoMA we put out some books
p48
aVjust for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
p49
aVAnd when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,
p50
aVand instead it was all \u2014 almost \u2014 all good suggestions.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd a lot of nationalism came in.
p53
aVFor instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,
p54
aVbut they were very proud
p55
aVso every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
p56
aVAnd I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good \u2014
p57
aVthey had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I keep it going, and I just got,
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aValso, this suggestion from Milan:
p62
aVit's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;
p63
aVit's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan
p64
aVto define all the lanes of traffic.
p65
aVSo, think of your own,
p66
aVsend them on if you want to \u2014 they're always welcome.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut an exhibition like that made me understand even more
p69
aVwhat I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
p70
aVI'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
p71
aVDifferent parts of the world have a knack for different things.
p72
aVI was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,
p73
aVand the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism
p74
aVthat you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn Italy, in Milan especially,
p77
aVcontemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
p78
aVBut design \u2014 oh, my God.
p79
aVWhat you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,
p80
aVis the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that
p81
aVwe are all so sophisticated.
p82
aVIt's just what you find at the store.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
p85
aVI'm always amazed \u2014 three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is
p86
aVand take you to the galleries.
p87
aVBut design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
p88
aVIt's really interesting:
p89
aVwhat many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of
p90
aVthis kind of overdesigned \u2014 in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but \u2014
p91
aVdecoration, interior decoration.
p92
aVThey think of somebody choosing fabrics.
p93
aa(lp94
VDesign can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
p95
aVIt can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way
p96
aVto design gas masks for people,
p97
aVbecause, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
p98
aVSo, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,
p99
aVso that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
p100
aa(lp101
VThey tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler
p102
aVcan be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
p103
aVAnd then they make a little tent for the baby.
p104
aVHowever cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,
p105
aVand it is miles away from the fancy furniture,
p106
aVbut still, it's part of my same field of passion.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to
p109
aVharness the power of MoMA
p110
aVbecause it's great to work there. You really have power
p111
aVin that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
p112
aVand that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
p113
aVI'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,
p114
aVand then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA
p117
aVin my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,
p118
aVwhich is to try and see what's going on in the world
p119
aVand try to use that authority in order to make things better.
p120
aVThere have been many episodes,
p121
aVand actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,
p122
aVbut in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather \u2014
p123
aVI'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly \u2014
p124
aVCharles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time
p125
aVwere involved in two competitions:
p126
aVone in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948
p127
aVwas low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war
p128
aVthat then sparked a whole line of furniture.
p129
aVAnd then there was good design for very low price.
p130
aVThere were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about
p131
aVpointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called
p134
aVMutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
p135
aVIt was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design
p136
aVin that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
p137
aVAnd that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels
p138
aVfrom the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;
p139
aVat that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
p140
aVAnd at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these
p141
aVbeautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
p142
aVSo you see, the range is really quite diverse.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd then, for instance, this other exhibition
p145
aVthat was entitled Workspheres in 2001,
p146
aVwhere I asked different designers to come up with ideas for
p147
aVthe new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
p148
aVAnd you see IDEO there.
p149
aVIt was beautiful \u2014 it was called Personal Skies.
p150
aVThe idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top
p151
aVof your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" \u2014 a sky in a room \u2014
p152
aVit's a very famous Italian song.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,
p155
aVand Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
p156
aVAnd this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:
p157
aVdesigners are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
p158
aVWhat they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,
p159
aVcurrent conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
p160
aVand then what they do at the end \u2014 if they are good \u2014
p161
aVis much more than the sum of its parts.
p162
aa(lp163
VHella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis
p164
aVthat is really quite amazing
p165
aVand also quite hilarious.
p166
aVThe idea behind her work was that
p167
aVat that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
p168
aVInstead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
p169
aVYeah, that's particularly gorgeous \u2014 it's the TV dinner of 2001.
p170
aa(lp171
VThere have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,
p172
aVbut I don't want to focus on my shows.
p173
aVI would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
p174
aVI've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
p175
aVI came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day
p176
aVI have to ask, "What does that mean?"
p177
aVSo, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that
p178
aVthere was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
p179
aVTherefore, he was not following everybody's lead,
p180
aVand therefore, he was a maverick.
p181
aVSo, designers do need to be mavericks,
p182
aVbecause the best way to design a successful object \u2014
p183
aVand also an object that we were missing before \u2014
p184
aVis to pretend that either it never existed
p185
aVor that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA
p188
aVand it ended at the beginning of last year.
p189
aVIt was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
p190
aVIt's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
p191
aVAnd then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition
p192
aVuntil, slowly but surely, it came back \u2014
p193
aVas a half-full glass instead of half-empty \u2014
p194
aVand it was about protection and safety.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to
p197
aVthese kind of water-sterilizing straws,
p198
aVso it was really wide-ranging.
p199
aVIt also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,
p200
aVand some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
p201
aVBut what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;
p202
aVdesign uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
p203
aVIt's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
p206
aVIt's a suit for civil disobedience.
p207
aVThe idea is that when you have a riot or a protest
p208
aVand the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing \u2014
p209
aVit's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart
p210
aVso your heartbeat is amplified \u2014
p211
aVand the police is reminded;
p212
aVit's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
p213
aVAnd also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit
p214
aVwill have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately
p217
aVfunctional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
p218
aVTony Dunne and Fiona Raby
p219
aVdid this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,
p220
aVlike this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor
p221
aVso it disappears completely and you can hide away;
p222
aVor even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article
p223
aVon the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States \u2014
p224
aVI don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;
p225
aVor this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that
p228
aVthe ultimate shelter is your sense of self,
p229
aVand there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
p230
aVThis is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer
p231
aVthat's done this series of Capsters.
p232
aVThey are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,
p233
aVdo whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd sometimes by doing this kind of research,
p236
aVyou encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
p237
aVTwan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with
p238
aVsome psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial
p239
aVstimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
p240
aVThey're quite beautiful.
p241
aVThey range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you \u2014
p242
aVbecause autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside \u2014
p243
aVall the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself
p244
aVin the mirror and regain a sense of self.
p245
aa(lp246
VDesign really looks upon the whole world
p247
aVand it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
p248
aVI was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
p249
aVAnd it was really interesting because I was the last speaker
p250
aVand before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,
p251
aVand I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time
p252
aVI felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,
p255
aVand there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
p256
aVI want to make this point by showing you two examples of
p257
aVdesign coming from a sense of economy \u2014 very, very clear limits.
p258
aVThis is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,
p259
aVand this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
p260
aVSo they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because
p261
aVthey're so smart and economical.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,
p264
aVFernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and
p265
aVsmartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are
p266
aVselling for an enormous amount of money.
p267
aVBut that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo really, design takes everything into account,
p270
aVand the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,
p271
aVas we become more and more wireless and impalpable,
p272
aVdesigners, instead, want us to be hands-on.
p273
aVSometimes hammer-on.
p274
aVThis is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
p275
aVEven this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes
p276
aVyour imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects
p277
aVthat are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
p278
aVFrom this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples
p279
aVto these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VIt's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
p283
aVMany years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,
p284
aVexplain how the innovation in the military industry \u2014
p285
aVtherefore, secret innovation \u2014 and the innovation in the
p286
aVcivilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
p287
aVAnd that makes sense.
p288
aVIn moments of war there's great technological innovation,
p289
aVand in the world you have to do without \u2014
p290
aVwell, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,
p291
aVyou had to do without aluminum.
p292
aVAnd then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden
p293
aVavailable for the civilian market.
p294
aVMany of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair
p295
aVby Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:
p296
aVfiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
p297
aa(lp298
VI think that this is a strange moment.
p299
aVThe rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,
p300
aVjust like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,
p301
aVso I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
p302
aVBut it surely is a very important moment for design,
p303
aVbecause not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing
p304
aVtechnology making open-source possible also in the world of design,
p305
aVbut also the idea of sustainability \u2014
p306
aVwhich is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,
p307
aVbut also sustainability of human interrelationships \u2014
p308
aVis very much part of the work of so many designers.
p309
aVAnd that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors
p310
aVrather than on objects.
p311
aVEspecially the good ones, not all of them.
p312
aa(lp313
VI wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,
p314
aVwhich is quite fantastic.
p315
aVHe's another young designer from France who's working \u2014
p316
aVand at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies \u2014
p317
aVon new ways to engage patients, especially children,
p318
aVin taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
p319
aa(lp320
VFor instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine
p321
aVthat kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,
p322
aVso the child has to go \u2014 pffff! \u2014 to release and relieve the container itself.
p323
aVAnd this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
p324
aVso intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved
p325
aVin this particular kind of delivery.
p326
aVSimilarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve
p327
aVyou in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth
p328
aVso that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
p329
aa(lp330
VThe next show that I'm going to work on \u2014
p331
aVand I've been bugging a lot of you about this here \u2014
p332
aVis about the relationship between design and science.
p333
aVI'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common \u2014
p334
aVthe common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations \u2014
p335
aVand I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design
p336
aVas an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
p339
aVI've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
p340
aVBut design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,
p341
aVand therefore, really work at the scale of the very small
p342
aVto make it very big and very meaningful.
p343
aVThank you. (Applause)
