VThere's an old joke about a cop
p4
aVwho's walking his beat in the middle of the night,
p5
aVand he comes across a guy under a street lamp
p6
aVwho's looking at the ground and moving from side to side,
p7
aVand the cop asks him what he's doing.
p8
aVThe guys says he's looking for his keys.
p9
aVSo the cop takes his time
p10
aVand looks over and kind of makes a little matrix
p11
aVand looks for about two, three minutes.
p12
aVNo keys.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe cop says, "Are you sure?
p15
aVHey buddy, are you sure you lost your keys here?"
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd the guy says, "No, actually I lost them
p18
aVdown at the other end of the street,
p19
aVbut the light is better here."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VThere's a concept that people talk about nowadays called "big data."
p24
aVAnd what they're talking about is all of the information
p25
aVthat we're generating through our interaction
p26
aVwith and over the Internet,
p27
aVeverything from Facebook and Twitter
p28
aVto music downloads, movies, streaming, all this kind of stuff,
p29
aVthe live streaming of TED.
p30
aVAnd the folks who work with big data, for them,
p31
aVthey talk about that their biggest problem
p32
aVis we have so much information.
p33
aVThe biggest problem is: how do we organize all that information?
p34
aa(lp35
VI can tell you that, working in global health,
p36
aVthat is not our biggest problem.
p37
aVBecause for us, even though the light is better on the Internet,
p38
aVthe data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve
p39
aVis not actually present on the Internet.
p40
aVSo we don't know, for example,
p41
aVhow many people right now are being affected by disasters
p42
aVor by conflict situations.
p43
aVWe don't know for, really, basically, any of the clinics
p44
aVin the developing world,
p45
aVwhich ones have medicines and which ones don't.
p46
aVWe have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics.
p47
aVWe don't know \u2014 and this is really amazing to me \u2014 we don't know
p48
aVhow many children were born \u2014 or how many children there are \u2014
p49
aVin Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.
p50
aVWe don't know how many kids died last week
p51
aVin any of those countries.
p52
aVWe don't know the needs of the elderly, the mentally ill.
p53
aVFor all of these different critically important problems
p54
aVor critically important areas that we want to solve problems in,
p55
aVwe basically know nothing at all.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd part of the reason why we don't know anything at all
p58
aVis that the information technology systems that we use in global health
p59
aVto find the data to solve these problems is what you see here.
p60
aVThis is about a 5,000-year-old technology.
p61
aVSome of you may have used it before.
p62
aVIt's kind of on its way out now,
p63
aVbut we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff.
p64
aVThis is a paper form.
p65
aVAnd what you're looking at is a paper form
p66
aVin the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia,
p67
aVwho is tramping out across the countryside
p68
aVin Indonesia on, I'm sure, a very hot and humid day,
p69
aVand she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors
p70
aVover a period of weeks or months,
p71
aVknocking on the doors and saying,
p72
aV"Excuse me, we'd like to ask you some questions.
p73
aVDo you have any children? Were your children vaccinated?"
p74
aa(lp75
VBecause the only way we can actually find out
p76
aVhow many children were vaccinated in the country of Indonesia,
p77
aVwhat percentage were vaccinated,
p78
aVis actually not on the Internet, but by going out and knocking on doors,
p79
aVsometimes tens of thousands of doors.
p80
aVSometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this.
p81
aVYou know, a census of Indonesia
p82
aVwould probably take two years to accomplish.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the problem, of course, with all of this
p85
aVis that, with all those paper forms \u2014
p86
aVand I'm telling you, we have paper forms for every possible thing:
p87
aVWe have paper forms for vaccination surveys.
p88
aVWe have paper forms to track people who come into clinics.
p89
aVWe have paper forms to track drug supplies, blood supplies \u2014
p90
aVall these different paper forms for many different topics,
p91
aVthey all have a single, common endpoint,
p92
aVand the common endpoint looks something like this.
p93
aVAnd what we're looking at here is a truckful of data.
p94
aVThis is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey
p95
aVin a single district in the country of Zambia
p96
aVfrom a few years ago, that I participated in.
p97
aVThe only thing anyone was trying to find out
p98
aVis what percentage of Zambian children are vaccinated,
p99
aVand this is the data, collected on paper over weeks,
p100
aVfrom a single district,
p101
aVwhich is something like a county in the United States.
p102
aVYou can imagine that, for the entire country of Zambia,
p103
aVanswering just that single question ...
p104
aVlooks something like this.
p105
aVTruck after truck after truck,
p106
aVfilled with stack after stack after stack of data.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd what makes it even worse is that's just the beginning.
p109
aVBecause once you've collected all that data,
p110
aVof course, someone \u2014 some unfortunate person \u2014
p111
aVis going to have to type that into a computer.
p112
aVWhen I was a graduate student,
p113
aVI actually was that unfortunate person sometimes.
p114
aVI can tell you, I often wasn't really paying attention.
p115
aVI probably made a lot of mistakes when I did it
p116
aVthat no one ever discovered, so data quality goes down.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut eventually that data, hopefully, gets typed into a computer,
p119
aVand someone can begin to analyze it,
p120
aVand once they have an analysis and a report,
p121
aVhopefully, then you can take the results of that data collection
p122
aVand use it to vaccinate children better.
p123
aa(lp124
VBecause if there's anything worse in the field of global public health \u2014
p125
aVI don't know what's worse than allowing children on this planet
p126
aVto die of vaccine-preventable diseases \u2014
p127
aVdiseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar.
p128
aVAnd millions of children die of these diseases every year.
p129
aVAnd the fact is, millions is a gross estimate,
p130
aVbecause we don't really know how many kids die each year of this.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhat makes it even more frustrating is that the data-entry part,
p133
aVthe part that I used to do as a grad student,
p134
aVcan take sometimes six months.
p135
aVSometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer,
p136
aVAnd sometimes, actually not infrequently,
p137
aVit actually never happens.
p138
aVNow try and wrap your head around that for a second.
p139
aVYou just had teams of hundreds of people.
p140
aVThey went out into the field to answer a particular question.
p141
aVYou probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
p142
aVon fuel and photocopying and per diem.
p143
aVAnd then for some reason, momentum is lost
p144
aVor there's no money left,
p145
aVand all of that comes to nothing,
p146
aVbecause no one actually types it into the computer at all.
p147
aVThe process just stops.
p148
aVHappens all the time.
p149
aVThis is what we base our decisions on in global health:
p150
aVlittle data, old data, no data.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo back in 1995,
p153
aVI began to think about ways in which we could improve this process.
p154
aVNow 1995 \u2014 obviously, that was quite a long time ago.
p155
aVIt kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was.
p156
aVThe top movie of the year was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."
p157
aVAs you can see, Bruce Willis had a lot more hair back then.
p158
aVI was working in the Centers for Disease Control
p159
aVand I had a lot more hair back then as well.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut to me, the most significant thing that I saw in 1995
p162
aVwas this.
p163
aVHard for us to imagine, but in 1995,
p164
aVthis was the ultimate elite mobile device.
p165
aVIt wasn't an iPhone. It wasn't a Galaxy phone.
p166
aVIt was a PalmPilot.
p167
aVAnd when I saw the PalmPilot for the first time, I thought,
p168
aV"Why can't we put the forms on these PalmPilots?
p169
aVAnd go out into the field just carrying one PalmPilot,
p170
aVwhich can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms?
p171
aVWhy don't we try to do that?
p172
aVBecause if we can do that,
p173
aVif we can actually just collect the data electronically, digitally,
p174
aVfrom the very beginning,
p175
aVwe can just put a shortcut right through that whole process
p176
aVof typing, of having somebody type that stuff into the computer.
p177
aVWe can skip straight to the analysis
p178
aVand then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives."
p179
aa(lp180
VSo that's what I began to do.
p181
aVWorking at CDC, I began to travel to different programs around the world
p182
aVand to train them in using PalmPilots to do data collection,
p183
aVinstead of using paper.
p184
aVAnd it actually worked great.
p185
aVIt worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted.
p186
aVWhat do you know?
p187
aVDigital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper.
p188
aVWhile I was doing it, my business partner,
p189
aVRose, who's here with her husband, Matthew, here in the audience,
p190
aVRose was out doing similar stuff for the American Red Cross.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe problem was, after a few years of doing that,
p193
aVI realized \u2014 I had been to maybe six or seven programs \u2014
p194
aVand I thought, you know, if I keep this up at this pace,
p195
aVover my whole career,
p196
aVmaybe I'm going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs.
p197
aVBut the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,
p198
aVlike, training 20 or 30 programs to use this technology,
p199
aVthat is a tiny drop in the bucket.
p200
aVThe demand for this, the need for data to run better programs
p201
aVjust within health \u2014 not to mention all of the other fields
p202
aVin developing countries \u2014 is enormous.
p203
aVThere are millions and millions and millions of programs,
p204
aVmillions of clinics that need to track drugs,
p205
aVmillions of vaccine programs.
p206
aVThere are schools that need to track attendance.
p207
aVThere are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do.
p208
aVAnd I realized if I kept up the way that I was doing,
p209
aVI was basically hardly going to make any impact
p210
aVby the end of my career.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd so I began to rack my brain,
p213
aVtrying to think about, what was the process that I was doing?
p214
aVHow was I training folks,
p215
aVand what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles
p216
aVto doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently?
p217
aVAnd, unfortunately, after thinking about this for some time,
p218
aVI identified the main obstacle.
p219
aVAnd the main obstacle, it turned out \u2014
p220
aVand this is a sad realization \u2014
p221
aVthe main obstacle was me.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo what do I mean by that?
p224
aVI had developed a process
p225
aVwhereby I was the center of the universe of this technology.
p226
aVIf you wanted to use this technology, you had to get in touch with me.
p227
aVThat means you had to know I existed.
p228
aVThen you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country
p229
aVand the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate.
p230
aVSo you could be talking about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,
p231
aVif I actually had the time or it fit my schedule
p232
aVand I wasn't on vacation.
p233
aVThe point is that anything,
p234
aVany system that depends on a single human being
p235
aVor two or three or five human beings \u2014
p236
aVit just doesn't scale.
p237
aVAnd this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology,
p238
aVand we need to scale it now.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd so I began to think of ways in which I could basically
p241
aVtake myself out of the picture.
p242
aVAnd, you know, I was thinking,
p243
aV"How could I take myself out of the picture?"
p244
aVfor quite some time.
p245
aVI'd been trained that the way you distribute technology
p246
aVwithin international development
p247
aVis always consultant-based.
p248
aVIt's always guys that look pretty much like me,
p249
aVflying from countries that look pretty much like this
p250
aVto other countries with people with darker skin.
p251
aVAnd you go out there, and you spend money on airfare
p252
aVand you spend time and you spend per diem
p253
aVand you spend for a hotel and all that stuff.
p254
aVAs far as I knew, that was the only way you could distribute technology,
p255
aVand I couldn't figure out a way around it.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut the miracle that happened \u2014
p258
aVI'm going to call it Hotmail for short.
p259
aVYou may not think of Hotmail as being miraculous,
p260
aVbut for me it was miraculous,
p261
aVbecause I noticed, just as I was wrestling with this problem \u2014
p262
aVI was working in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly, at the time \u2014
p263
aVI noticed that every sub-Saharan African health worker
p264
aVthat I was working with had a Hotmail account.
p265
aVAnd it struck me, "Wait a minute \u2014
p266
aVI know the Hotmail people surely didn't fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya
p267
aVto train people in how to use Hotmail.
p268
aVSo these guys are distributing technology, getting software capacity out there,
p269
aVbut they're not actually flying around the world.
p270
aVI need to think about this more."
p271
aVWhile I was thinking about it,
p272
aVpeople started using even more things like this, just as we were.
p273
aVThey started using LinkedIn and Flickr and Gmail and Google Maps \u2014
p274
aVall these things.
p275
aVOf course, all of these things are cloud based
p276
aVand don't require any training.
p277
aVThey don't require any programmers.
p278
aVThey don't require consultants.
p279
aVBecause the business model for all these businesses
p280
aVrequires that something be so simple we can use it ourselves,
p281
aVwith little or no training.
p282
aVYou just have to hear about it and go to the website.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd so I thought, what would happen if we built software
p285
aVto do what I'd been consulting in?
p286
aVInstead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices,
p287
aVlet's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training
p288
aVand without me being involved.
p289
aVAnd that's exactly what we did.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo we created software called Magpi, which has an online form creator.
p292
aVNo one has to speak to me,
p293
aVyou just have to hear about it and go to the website.
p294
aVYou can create forms, and once you've created the forms,
p295
aVyou push them to a variety of common mobile phones.
p296
aVObviously, nowadays, we've moved past PalmPilots to mobile phones.
p297
aVAnd it doesn't have to be a smartphone, it can be a basic phone,
p298
aVlike the phone on the right, the basic Symbian phone
p299
aVthat's very common in developing countries.
p300
aVAnd the great part about this is it's just like Hotmail.
p301
aVIt's cloud based,
p302
aVand it doesn't require any training, programming, consultants.
p303
aa(lp304
VBut there are some additional benefits as well.
p305
aVNow we knew when we built this system,
p306
aVthe whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots,
p307
aVwas that you'd be able to collect the data
p308
aVand immediately upload the data and get your data set.
p309
aVBut what we found, of course, since it's already on a computer,
p310
aVwe can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing.
p311
aVWe can take a process that took two years
p312
aVand compress that down to the space of five minutes.
p313
aVUnbelievable improvements in efficiency.
p314
aVCloud based, no training, no consultants, no me.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd I told you that in the first few years
p317
aVof trying to do this the old-fashioned way,
p318
aVgoing out to each country,
p319
aVwe probably trained about 1,000 people.
p320
aVWhat happened after we did this?
p321
aVIn the second three years,
p322
aVwe had 14,000 people find the website,
p323
aVsign up and start using it to collect data:
p324
aVdata for disaster response,
p325
aVCanadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds,
p326
aVpeople tracking drug supplies.
p327
aa(lp328
VOne of my favorite examples, the IRC, International Rescue Committee,
p329
aVthey have a program where semi-literate midwives,
p330
aVusing $10 mobile phones,
p331
aVsend a text message using our software, once a week,
p332
aVwith the number of births and the number of deaths,
p333
aVwhich gives IRC something that no one in global health has ever had:
p334
aVa near-real-time system of counting babies,
p335
aVof knowing how many kids are born,
p336
aVof knowing how many children there are in Sierra Leone,
p337
aVwhich is the country where this is happening,
p338
aVand knowing how many children die.
p339
aa(lp340
VPhysicians for Human Rights \u2014
p341
aVthis is moving a little bit outside the health field \u2014
p342
aVthey're basically training people to do rape exams in Congo,
p343
aVwhere this is an epidemic,
p344
aVa horrible epidemic,
p345
aVand they're using our software to document the evidence they find,
p346
aVincluding photographically,
p347
aVso that they can bring the perpetrators to justice.
p348
aa(lp349
VCamfed, another charity based out of the UK \u2014
p350
aVCamfed pays girls' families to keep them in school.
p351
aVThey understand this is the most significant intervention they can make.
p352
aVThey used to track the disbursements, the attendance, the grades, on paper.
p353
aVThe turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance
p354
aVand getting that into a report was about two to three years.
p355
aVNow it's real time.
p356
aVAnd because this is such a low-cost system and based in the cloud,
p357
aVit costs, for the entire five countries that Camfed runs this in,
p358
aVwith tens of thousands of girls,
p359
aVthe whole cost combined is 10,000 dollars a year.
p360
aVThat's less than I used to get
p361
aVjust traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo I told you before that when we were doing it the old-fashioned way,
p364
aVI realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket \u2014
p365
aV10, 20, 30 different programs.
p366
aVWe've made a lot of progress,
p367
aVbut I recognize that right now,
p368
aVeven the work that we've done with 14,000 people using this
p369
aVis still a drop in the bucket.
p370
aa(lp371
VBut something's changed, and I think it should be obvious.
p372
aVWhat's changed now is,
p373
aVinstead of having a program in which we're scaling at such a slow rate
p374
aVthat we can never reach all the people who need us,
p375
aVwe've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us.
p376
aVWe've created a tool that lets programs keep kids in school,
p377
aVtrack the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die,
p378
aVcatch criminals and successfully prosecute them \u2014
p379
aVto do all these different things to learn more about what's going on,
p380
aVto understand more,
p381
aVto see more ...
p382
aVand to save lives and improve lives.
p383
