VThis is the venue
p4
aVwhere, as a young man,
p5
aVsome of the music that I wrote was first performed.
p6
aVIt was, remarkably,
p7
aVa pretty good sounding room.
p8
aVWith all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,
p9
aVit actually sounded pretty good.
p10
aVThis is a song that was recorded there.
p11
aV(Music)
p12
aVThis is not Talking Heads,
p13
aVin the picture anyway.
p14
aV(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)
p15
aVSo the nature of the room
p16
aVmeant that words could be understood.
p17
aVThe lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.
p18
aVThe sound system was kind of decent.
p19
aVAnd there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
p20
aVSo the rhythms
p21
aVcould be pretty intact too,
p22
aVpretty concise.
p23
aVOther places around the country had similar rooms.
p24
aVThis is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
p25
aVThe music was in some ways different,
p26
aVbut in structure and form,
p27
aVvery much the same.
p28
aVThe clientele behavior was very much the same too.
p29
aVAnd so the bands at Tootsie's
p30
aVor at CBGB's
p31
aVhad to play loud enough \u2014
p32
aVthe volume had to be loud enough to overcome
p33
aVpeople falling down, shouting out
p34
aVand doing whatever else they were doing.
p35
aa(lp36
VSince then, I've played other places
p37
aVthat are much nicer.
p38
aVI've played the Disney Hall here
p39
aVand Carnegie Hall and places like that.
p40
aVAnd it's been very exciting.
p41
aVBut I also noticed that sometimes the music
p42
aVthat I had written,
p43
aVor was writing at the time,
p44
aVdidn't sound all that great
p45
aVin some of those halls.
p46
aVWe managed,
p47
aVbut sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited
p48
aVto the music I was making
p49
aVor had made.
p50
aVSo I asked myself:
p51
aVDo I write stuff
p52
aVfor specific rooms?
p53
aVDo I have a place, a venue,
p54
aVin mind when I write?
p55
aVIs that a kind of model for creativity?
p56
aVDo we all make things with
p57
aVa venue, a context, in mind?
p58
aa(lp59
VOkay, Africa.
p60
aV(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)
p61
aVMost of the popular music that we know now
p62
aVhas a big part of its roots in West Africa.
p63
aVAnd the music there,
p64
aVI would say, the instruments,
p65
aVthe intricate rhythms,
p66
aVthe way it's played, the setting, the context,
p67
aVit's all perfect. It all works perfect.
p68
aVThe music works perfectly in that setting.
p69
aVThere's no big room
p70
aVto create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.
p71
aVThe instruments are loud enough
p72
aVthat they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
p73
aVIt's no accident.
p74
aVIt's perfect for that particular context.
p75
aVAnd it would be a mess
p76
aVin a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
p77
aV(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)
p78
aVIn a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
p79
aVIt doesn't change key, the notes are long,
p80
aVthere's almost no rhythm whatsoever,
p81
aVand the room flatters the music.
p82
aVIt actually improves it.
p83
aVThis is the room that Bach
p84
aVwrote some of his music for. This is the organ.
p85
aVIt's not as big as a gothic cathedral,
p86
aVso he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.
p87
aVHe can, very innovatively,
p88
aVactually change keys
p89
aVwithout risking huge dissonances.
p90
aV(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)
p91
aa(lp92
VThis is a little bit later.
p93
aVThis is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
p94
aVI think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.
p95
aVThey're smaller, even less reverberant,
p96
aVso he can write really frilly music
p97
aVthat's very intricate \u2014 and it works.
p98
aV(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)
p99
aVIt fits the room perfectly.
p100
aVThis is La Scala.
p101
aVIt's around the same time,
p102
aVI think it was built around 1776.
p103
aVPeople in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,
p104
aVthey used to yell out to one another.
p105
aVThey used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,
p106
aVjust like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
p107
aVIf they liked an aria,
p108
aVthey would holler and suggest
p109
aVthat it be done again as an encore,
p110
aVnot at the end of the show, but immediately.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVAnd well, that was an opera experience.
p113
aVThis is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
p114
aVAnd the size of the room is not that big.
p115
aVIt's smaller than this.
p116
aVBut Wagner made an innovation.
p117
aVHe wanted a bigger band.
p118
aVHe wanted a little more bombast,
p119
aVso he increased the size of the orchestra pit
p120
aVso he could get more low-end instruments in there.
p121
aV(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)
p122
aa(lp123
VOkay.
p124
aVThis is Carnegie Hall.
p125
aVObviously, this kind of thing became popular.
p126
aVThe halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
p127
aVIt's larger than some of the other symphony halls.
p128
aVAnd they're a lot more reverberant
p129
aVthan La Scala.
p130
aVAround the same,
p131
aVaccording to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,
p132
aVthis kind of rule came into effect
p133
aVthat audiences had to be quiet \u2014
p134
aVno more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,
p135
aVor gossiping with one another
p136
aVduring the show.
p137
aVThey had to be very quiet.
p138
aVSo those two things combined meant that
p139
aVa different kind of music
p140
aVworked best in these kind of halls.
p141
aVIt meant that there could be extreme dynamics,
p142
aVwhich there weren't in some of these
p143
aVother kinds of music.
p144
aVQuiet parts could be heard
p145
aVthat would have been drowned out
p146
aVby all the gossiping and shouting.
p147
aVBut because of the reverberation
p148
aVin those rooms like Carnegie Hall,
p149
aVthe music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic
p150
aVand a little more textural.
p151
aV(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)
p152
aVThis is Mahler.
p153
aVIt looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
p154
aVThat was Bob's last record, yeah.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VPopular music, coming along at the same time.
p159
aVThis is a jazz band.
p160
aVAccording to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing
p161
aVon riverboats and clubs.
p162
aVAgain, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
p163
aVThere's certain sections of the song \u2014 the songs had different sections
p164
aVthat the dancers really liked.
p165
aVAnd they'd say, "Play that part again."
p166
aVWell, there's only so many times
p167
aVyou can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.
p168
aVSo the bands started to improvise new melodies.
p169
aVAnd a new form of music was born.
p170
aV(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)
p171
aVThese are played mainly in small rooms.
p172
aVPeople are dancing, shouting and drinking.
p173
aVSo the music has to be loud enough
p174
aVto be heard above that.
p175
aVSame thing goes true for \u2014 that's the beginning of the century \u2014
p176
aVfor the whole of 20th-century popular music,
p177
aVwhether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.
p178
aV[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
p179
aa(lp180
VIt changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,
p181
aVwhen this became
p182
aVone of the primary venues for music.
p183
aVAnd this was one way
p184
aVthat the music got there.
p185
aVMicrophones enabled singers, in particular,
p186
aVand musicians and composers,
p187
aVto completely change the kind of music
p188
aVthat they were writing.
p189
aVSo far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,
p190
aVbut singers, like Frank Sinatra,
p191
aVcould use the mic
p192
aVand do things
p193
aVthat they could never do without a microphone.
p194
aVOther singers after him
p195
aVwent even further.
p196
aV(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)
p197
aVThis is Chet Baker.
p198
aVAnd this kind of thing
p199
aVwould have been impossible without a microphone.
p200
aVIt would have been impossible without recorded music as well.
p201
aVAnd he's singing right into your ear.
p202
aVHe's whispering into your ears.
p203
aVThe effect is just electric.
p204
aVIt's like the guy is sitting next to you,
p205
aVwhispering who knows what into your ear.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo at this point, music diverged.
p208
aVThere's live music,
p209
aVand there's recorded music.
p210
aVAnd they no longer have to be exactly the same.
p211
aVNow there's venues like this, a discotheque,
p212
aVand there's jukeboxes in bars,
p213
aVwhere you don't even need to have a band.
p214
aVThere doesn't need to be any
p215
aVlive performing musicians whatsoever,
p216
aVand the sound systems are good.
p217
aVPeople began to make music
p218
aVspecifically for discos
p219
aVand for those sound systems.
p220
aVAnd, as with jazz,
p221
aVthe dancers liked certain sections
p222
aVmore than they did others.
p223
aVSo the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.
p224
aV(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)
p225
aVThe MC would improvise lyrics
p226
aVin the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.
p227
aVAnd another new form of music was born.
p228
aa(lp229
VLive performance, when it was incredibly successful,
p230
aVended up in what is probably, acoustically,
p231
aVthe worst sounding venues on the planet:
p232
aVsports stadiums,
p233
aVbasketball arenas and hockey arenas.
p234
aVMusicians who ended up there did the best they could.
p235
aVThey wrote what is now called arena rock,
p236
aVwhich is medium-speed ballads.
p237
aV(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)
p238
aVThey did the best they could
p239
aVgiven that this is what they're writing for.
p240
aVThe tempos are medium. It sounds big.
p241
aVIt's more a social situation
p242
aVthan a musical situation.
p243
aVAnd in some ways, the music
p244
aVthat they're writing for this place
p245
aVworks perfectly.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo there's more new venues.
p248
aVOne of the new ones is the automobile.
p249
aVI grew up with a radio in a car.
p250
aVBut now that's evolved into something else.
p251
aVThe car is a whole venue.
p252
aV(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)
p253
aVThe music that, I would say, is written
p254
aVfor automobile sound systems
p255
aVworks perfectly on it.
p256
aVIt might not be what you want to listen to at home,
p257
aVbut it works great in the car \u2014
p258
aVhas a huge frequency spectrum,
p259
aVyou know, big bass and high-end
p260
aVand the voice kind of stuck in the middle.
p261
aVAutomobile music, you can share with your friends.
p262
aa(lp263
VThere's one other kind of new venue,
p264
aVthe private MP3 player.
p265
aVPresumably, this is just for Christian music.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVAnd in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,
p268
aVor when the audience had to hush up,
p269
aVbecause you can now hear every single detail.
p270
aVIn other ways, it's more like the West African music
p271
aVbecause if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,
p272
aVyou turn it up, and the next minute,
p273
aVyour ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
p274
aVSo that doesn't really work.
p275
aVI think pop music, mainly,
p276
aVit's written today,
p277
aVto some extent, is written for these kind of players,
p278
aVfor this kind of personal experience
p279
aVwhere you can hear extreme detail,
p280
aVbut the dynamic doesn't change that much.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo I asked myself:
p283
aVOkay, is this
p284
aVa model for creation,
p285
aVthis adaptation that we do?
p286
aVAnd does it happen anywhere else?
p287
aVWell, according to David Attenborough and some other people,
p288
aVbirds do it too \u2014
p289
aVthat the birds in the canopy,
p290
aVwhere the foliage is dense,
p291
aVtheir calls tend to be
p292
aVhigh-pitched, short and repetitive.
p293
aVAnd the birds on the floor
p294
aVtend to have lower pitched calls,
p295
aVso that they don't get distorted
p296
aVwhen they bounce off the forest floor.
p297
aVAnd birds like this Savannah sparrow,
p298
aVthey tend to have a buzzing
p299
aV(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)
p300
aVtype call.
p301
aVAnd it turns out that
p302
aVa sound like this
p303
aVis the most energy efficient and practical way
p304
aVto transmit their call
p305
aVacross the fields and savannahs.
p306
aVOther birds, like this tanager,
p307
aVhave adapted within the same species.
p308
aVThe tananger on the East Coast of the United States,
p309
aVwhere the forests are a little denser,
p310
aVhas one kind of call,
p311
aVand the tananger on the other side, on the west
p312
aV(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
p313
aVhas a different kind of call.
p314
aV(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
p315
aVSo birds do it too.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd I thought:
p318
aVWell, if this is a model for creation,
p319
aVif we make music,
p320
aVprimarily the form at least,
p321
aVto fit these contexts,
p322
aVand if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,
p323
aVand if we write software to fit existing operating systems,
p324
aVis that how it works?
p325
aVYeah. I think it's evolutionary.
p326
aVIt's adaptive.
p327
aVBut the pleasure and the passion and the joy
p328
aVis still there.
p329
aVThis is a reverse view of things
p330
aVfrom the kind of traditional Romantic view.
p331
aVThe Romantic view is that
p332
aVfirst comes the passion
p333
aVand then the outpouring of emotion,
p334
aVand then somehow it gets shaped into something.
p335
aVAnd I'm saying,
p336
aVwell, the passion's still there,
p337
aVbut the vessel
p338
aVthat it's going to be injected into and poured into,
p339
aVthat is instinctively and intuitively
p340
aVcreated first.
p341
aVWe already know where that passion is going.
p342
aVBut this conflict of views is kind of interesting.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe writer,
p345
aVThomas Frank,
p346
aVsays that
p347
aVthis might be a kind of explanation
p348
aVwhy some voters vote
p349
aVagainst their best interests,
p350
aVthat voters, like a lot of us,
p351
aVassume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,
p352
aVthat it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,
p353
aVthat it's more authentic.
p354
aVAnd they'll vote for that.
p355
aVSo that, if somebody can fake sincerity,
p356
aVif they can fake passion,
p357
aVthey stand a better chance
p358
aVof being selected in that way,
p359
aVwhich seems a little dangerous.
p360
aVI'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,
p361
aVare not mutually exclusive.
p362
aa(lp363
VMaybe what the world needs now is for us to realize
p364
aVthat we are like the birds.
p365
aVWe adapt.
p366
aVWe sing.
p367
aVAnd like the birds, the joy is still there,
p368
aVeven though we have changed what we do
p369
aVto fit the context.
p370
