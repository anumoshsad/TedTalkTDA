VEverybody in our society's life is touched by cancer \u2014
p4
aVif not personally,
p5
aVthen through a loved one, a family member,
p6
aVcolleague, friend.
p7
aVAnd once our lives are touched by cancer,
p8
aVwe quickly learn
p9
aVthat there are basically
p10
aVthree weapons, or three tools, that are available
p11
aVto fight the disease:
p12
aVsurgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
p13
aVAnd once we get involved
p14
aVin the therapeutic decisions,
p15
aVagain either personally
p16
aVor with our loved ones and family members,
p17
aVwe also very quickly learn
p18
aVthe benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations
p19
aVof these tools.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark
p22
aVand the TEDMED team
p23
aVfor inviting me today
p24
aVto describe a fourth tool, a new tool,
p25
aVthat we call Tumor Treating Fields.
p26
aVTumor Treating Fields
p27
aVwere invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,
p28
aVprofessor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.
p29
aVAnd they use low-intensity
p30
aVelectric fields
p31
aVto fight cancer.
p32
aVTo understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,
p33
aVwe first need to understand
p34
aVwhat are electric fields.
p35
aa(lp36
VLet me first address
p37
aVa few popular misconceptions.
p38
aVFirst of all, electric fields
p39
aVare not an electric current
p40
aVthat is coursing through the tissue.
p41
aVElectric fields
p42
aVare not ionizing radiation,
p43
aVlike X-rays or proton beams,
p44
aVthat bombard tissue
p45
aVto disrupt DNA.
p46
aVAnd electric fields
p47
aVare not magnetism.
p48
aVWhat electric fields are
p49
aVare a field of forces.
p50
aVAnd these forces
p51
aVact on, attract, bodies
p52
aVthat have an electrical charge.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe best way to visualize an electric field
p55
aVis to think of gravity.
p56
aVGravity is also a field of forces
p57
aVthat act on masses.
p58
aVWe can all picture astronauts in space.
p59
aVThey float freely in three dimensions
p60
aVwithout any forces acting on them.
p61
aVBut as that space shuttle
p62
aVreturns to Earth,
p63
aVand as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,
p64
aVthey begin to see the effects of gravity.
p65
aVThey begin to be attracted towards Earth.
p66
aVAnd as they land,
p67
aVthey're fully aligned in the gravitational field.
p68
aVWe're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.
p69
aVThat's why you're all in your chairs.
p70
aVAnd that's why we have to use our muscle energy
p71
aVto stand up, to walk around
p72
aVand to lift things.
p73
aa(lp74
VIn cancer,
p75
aVcells rapidly divide
p76
aVand lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
p77
aVWe can think of a cell
p78
aVfrom an electrical perspective
p79
aVas if it's a mini space station.
p80
aVAnd in that space station
p81
aVwe have the genetic material, the chromosomes,
p82
aVwithin a nucleus.
p83
aVAnd out in the cytoplasmic soup
p84
aVwe have special proteins
p85
aVthat are required for cell division
p86
aVthat float freely in this soup
p87
aVin three dimensions.
p88
aVImportantly, those special proteins
p89
aVare among the most highly charged objects
p90
aVin our body.
p91
aVAs cell division begins
p92
aVthe nucleus disintegrates,
p93
aVthe chromosomes line up
p94
aVin the middle of the cell
p95
aVand those special proteins
p96
aVundergo a three-dimensional sequence
p97
aVwhereby they attach
p98
aVand they literally click into place end-on-end
p99
aVto form chains.
p100
aVThese chains
p101
aVthen progress and attach
p102
aVto the genetic material
p103
aVand pull the genetic material
p104
aVfrom one cell into two cells.
p105
aVAnd this is exactly how
p106
aVone cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,
p107
aVtwo cancer cells become four cancer cells,
p108
aVand we have ultimately
p109
aVuncontrolled tumor growth.
p110
aa(lp111
VTumor Treating Fields
p112
aVuse externally placed transducers
p113
aVattached to a field generator
p114
aVto create an artificial electric field
p115
aVon that space station.
p116
aVAnd when that cellular space station
p117
aVis within the electric field,
p118
aVit acts on those highly charged proteins
p119
aVand aligns them.
p120
aVAnd it prevents them from forming those chains,
p121
aVthose mitotic spindles,
p122
aVthat are necessary to pull the genetic material
p123
aVinto the daughter cells.
p124
aVWhat we see is that the cells will attempt to divide
p125
aVfor several hours.
p126
aVAnd they will either enter into
p127
aVthis so-called cellular suicide,
p128
aVprogrammed cell death,
p129
aVor they will form unhealthy daughter cells
p130
aVand enter into apoptosis
p131
aVonce they have divided.
p132
aVAnd we can observe this.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhat I'm going to show you next
p135
aVare two in vitro experiments.
p136
aVThis is cultures, identical cultures,
p137
aVof cervical cancer cells.
p138
aVAnd we've stained these cultures
p139
aVwith a green florescent dye
p140
aVso that we can look at these proteins
p141
aVthat form these chains.
p142
aVThe first clip shows
p143
aVa normal cell division
p144
aVwithout the Tumor Treating Fields.
p145
aVWhat we see
p146
aVare, first of all, a very active culture,
p147
aVa lot of divisions,
p148
aVand then very clear nuclei
p149
aVonce the cells have separated.
p150
aVAnd we can see them dividing throughout.
p151
aVWhen we apply the fields \u2014
p152
aVagain, in the identical time-scale
p153
aVto the identical culture \u2014
p154
aVyou're going to see something different.
p155
aVThe cells round up for division,
p156
aVbut they're very static in that position.
p157
aVWe'll see two cells
p158
aVin the upper part of the screen
p159
aVattempting to divide.
p160
aVThe one within the circle manages.
p161
aVBut see how much of the protein
p162
aVis still throughout the nucleus,
p163
aVeven in the dividing cell.
p164
aVThe one up there can't divide at all.
p165
aVAnd then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,
p166
aVis the hallmark
p167
aVof apoptosis in this cell.
p168
aa(lp169
VFormation of healthy mitotic spindles
p170
aVis necessary for division
p171
aVin all cell types.
p172
aVWe've applied Tumor Treating Fields
p173
aVto over 20 different cancers in the lab,
p174
aVand we see this effect
p175
aVin all of them.
p176
aVNow importantly,
p177
aVthese Tumor Treating Fields have no effect
p178
aVon normal undividing cells.
p179
aa(lp180
V10 years ago,
p181
aVDr. Palti founded a company called Novocure
p182
aVto develop his discovery
p183
aVinto a practical therapy for patients.
p184
aVIn that time, Novocure's developed two systems \u2014
p185
aVone system for cancers in the head
p186
aVand another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.
p187
aVThe first cancer that we have focused on
p188
aVis the deadly brain cancer, GBM.
p189
aVGBM affects about 10,000 people
p190
aVin the U.S. each year.
p191
aVIt's a death sentence.
p192
aVThe expected five year survival
p193
aVis less than five percent.
p194
aVAnd the typical patient
p195
aVwith optimal therapy
p196
aVsurvives just a little over a year,
p197
aVand only about seven months
p198
aVfrom the time that the cancer is first treated
p199
aVand then comes back and starts growing again.
p200
aa(lp201
VNovocure conducted
p202
aVits first phase three randomized trial
p203
aVin patients with recurrent GBM.
p204
aVSo these are patients
p205
aVwho had received surgery,
p206
aVhigh dose radiation to the head
p207
aVand first-line chemotherapy,
p208
aVand that had failed and their tumors had grown back.
p209
aVWe divided the patients into two groups.
p210
aVThe first group received second-line chemotherapy,
p211
aVwhich is expected to double the life expectancy,
p212
aVversus no treatment at all.
p213
aVAnd then the second group
p214
aVreceived only Tumor Treating Field therapy.
p215
aVWhat we saw in that trial
p216
aVis that that the life expectancies of both groups \u2014
p217
aVso the chemotherapy treated group
p218
aVand the Tumor Treating Field group \u2014
p219
aVwas the same.
p220
aVBut importantly,
p221
aVthe Tumor Treating Field group
p222
aVsuffered none of the side effects
p223
aVtypical of chemotherapy patients.
p224
aVThey had no pain,
p225
aVsuffered none of the infections.
p226
aVThey had no nausea, diarrhea,
p227
aVconstipation, fatigue
p228
aVthat would be expected.
p229
aa(lp230
VBased on this trial,
p231
aVin April of this year,
p232
aVthe FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields
p233
aVfor the treatment of patients
p234
aVwith recurrent GBM.
p235
aVImportantly, it was the first time ever
p236
aVthat the FDA included
p237
aVin their approval of an oncology treatment
p238
aVa quality of life claim.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo I'm going to show you now
p241
aVone of the patients
p242
aVfrom this trial.
p243
aVRobert Dill-Bundi
p244
aVis a famous Swiss cycling champion.
p245
aVHe won the gold medal in Moscow
p246
aVin the 4,000 meter pursuit.
p247
aVAnd five years ago,
p248
aVRobert was diagnosed with GBM.
p249
aVHe received the standard treatments.
p250
aVHe received surgery.
p251
aVHe received high dose radiation to the head.
p252
aVAnd he received first-line chemotherapy.
p253
aVA year after this treatment \u2014
p254
aVin fact, this is his baseline MRI.
p255
aVYou can see that the black regions
p256
aVin the upper right quadrant
p257
aVare the areas where he had surgery.
p258
aVAnd a year after that treatment,
p259
aVhis tumor grew back with a vengeance.
p260
aVThat cloudy white mass that you see
p261
aVis the recurrence of the tumor.
p262
aa(lp263
VAt this point, he was told by his doctors
p264
aVthat he had about 3 months to live.
p265
aVHe entered our trial.
p266
aVAnd here we can see him getting the therapy.
p267
aVFirst of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.
p268
aVThey're attached to the skin
p269
aVin the area of the tumor.
p270
aVHere you can see
p271
aVthat a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.
p272
aVThe patients learn to do this themselves
p273
aVAnd then the patients
p274
aVcan undergo all the activities of their daily life.
p275
aVThere's none of the tiredness.
p276
aVThere's none of what is called the "chemo head."
p277
aVThere's no sensation.
p278
aVIt doesn't interfere
p279
aVwith computers or electrical equipment.
p280
aVAnd the therapy is delivered continuously
p281
aVat home,
p282
aVwithout having to go into the hospital
p283
aVeither periodically or continually.
p284
aa(lp285
VThese are Robert's MRIs,
p286
aVagain, under only TTField treatment.
p287
aVThis is a therapy that takes time to work.
p288
aVIt's a medical device;
p289
aVit works when it's on.
p290
aVBut what we can see is, by month six,
p291
aVthe tumor has responded
p292
aVand it's begun to melt away.
p293
aVIt's still there.
p294
aVBy month 12,
p295
aVwe could argue whether
p296
aVthere's a little bit of material around the edges,
p297
aVbut it's essentially completely gone.
p298
aVIt's now five years
p299
aVsince Robert's diagnosis,
p300
aVand he's alive,
p301
aVbut importantly, he's healthy
p302
aVand he's at work.
p303
aVI'm going to let him, in this very short clip,
p304
aVdescribe his impressions of the therapy
p305
aVin his own words.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,
p308
aVI rate what I have today
p309
aVa bit different than what most people would assume.
p310
aVI am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.
p311
aVAnd every single morning I appreciate life.
p312
aVEvery night I fall asleep very well,
p313
aVand I am, I repeat,
p314
aVthe happiest man in the world,
p315
aVand I'm thankful I am alive.
p316
aa(lp317
VBD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer
p318
aVas the second target.
p319
aVWe've run a phase two trial
p320
aVin Switzerland
p321
aVon, again, recurrent patients \u2014
p322
aVpatients who have received standard therapy
p323
aVand whose cancer has come back.
p324
aVI'm going to show you another clip
p325
aVof a woman named Lydia.
p326
aVLydia's a 66 year-old farmer
p327
aVin Switzerland.
p328
aVShe was diagnosed with lung cancer
p329
aVfive years ago.
p330
aVShe underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy
p331
aVover two years,
p332
aVnone of which had an effect.
p333
aVHer cancer continued to grow.
p334
aVThree years ago,
p335
aVshe entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.
p336
aa(lp337
VYou can see, in her case,
p338
aVshe's wearing her transducer arrays,
p339
aVone of the front of her chest, one on the back,
p340
aVand then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.
p341
aVYou can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,
p342
aVbut importantly you can also see that she is living her life.
p343
aVShe is managing her farm.
p344
aVShe's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.
p345
aVAnd when we talked to her,
p346
aVshe said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,
p347
aVshe had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.
p348
aVHer whole family suffered
p349
aVas her side effect profile came and went.
p350
aVNow she can run
p351
aVall of the activities of her farm.
p352
aVIt's only the beginning.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Applause)
p355
aa(lp356
VIn the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies
p357
aVbetween chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.
p358
aVThere's research underway now at Harvard Medical School
p359
aVto pick the optimum pairs
p360
aVto maximize that benefit.
p361
aVWe also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation
p362
aVand interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.
p363
aVThere's now a new research project underway
p364
aVat the Karolinska in Sweden
p365
aVto prove that hypothesis.
p366
aa(lp367
VWe have more trials planned
p368
aVfor lung cancer,
p369
aVpancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer
p370
aVand breast cancer.
p371
aVAnd I firmly believe
p372
aVthat in the next 10 years
p373
aVTumor Treating Fields
p374
aVwill be a weapon available to doctors and patients
p375
aVfor all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.
p376
aVI'm also very hopeful
p377
aVthat in the next decades,
p378
aVwe will make big strides
p379
aVon reducing that death rate
p380
aVthat has been so challenging in this disease.
p381
