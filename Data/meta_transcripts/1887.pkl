VA couple of years ago,
p4
aVHarvard Business School chose
p5
aVthe best business model of that year.
p6
aVIt chose Somali piracy.
p7
aVPretty much around the same time,
p8
aVI discovered that there were 544 seafarers
p9
aVbeing held hostage on ships,
p10
aVoften anchored just off the Somali coast
p11
aVin plain sight.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I learned these two facts, and I thought,
p14
aVwhat's going on in shipping?
p15
aVAnd I thought, would that happen in any other industry?
p16
aVWould we see 544 airline pilots
p17
aVheld captive in their jumbo jets
p18
aVon a runway for months, or a year?
p19
aVWould we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?
p20
aVIt wouldn't happen.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I started to get intrigued.
p23
aVAnd I discovered another fact,
p24
aVwhich to me was more astonishing
p25
aValmost for the fact that I hadn't known it before
p26
aVat the age of 42, 43.
p27
aVThat is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping.
p28
aVBecause perhaps the general public
p29
aVthinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,
p30
aVsomething brought by sailboat
p31
aVwith Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.
p32
aVBut shipping isn't that.
p33
aVShipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.
p34
aVShipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.
p35
aVShipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.
p36
aVWe are more dependent on it now than ever.
p37
aVAnd yet, for such an enormous industry \u2014
p38
aVthere are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea \u2014
p39
aVit's become pretty much invisible.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,
p42
aVbecause here shipping is so present
p43
aVthat you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVBut elsewhere in the world,
p46
aVif you ask the general public what they know
p47
aVabout shipping and how much trade is carried by sea,
p48
aVyou will get essentially a blank face.
p49
aVYou will ask someone on the street
p50
aVif they've heard of Microsoft.
p51
aVI should think they'll say yes,
p52
aVbecause they'll know that they make software
p53
aVthat goes on computers,
p54
aVand occasionally works.
p55
aVBut if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,
p56
aVI doubt you'd get the same response,
p57
aVeven though Maersk,
p58
aVwhich is just one shipping company amongst many,
p59
aVhas revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.
p60
aV[$60.2 billion]
p61
aa(lp62
VNow why is this?
p63
aVA few years ago,
p64
aVthe first sea lord of the British admiralty \u2014
p65
aVhe is called the first sea lord,
p66
aValthough the chief of the army is not called a land lord \u2014
p67
aVhe said that we, and he meant
p68
aVin the industrialized nations in the West,
p69
aVthat we suffer from sea blindness.
p70
aVWe are blind to the sea
p71
aVas a place of industry or of work.
p72
aVIt's just something we fly over,
p73
aVa patch of blue on an airline map.
p74
aVNothing to see, move along.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I wanted to open my own eyes
p77
aVto my own sea blindness,
p78
aVso I ran away to sea.
p79
aVA couple of years ago, I took a passage
p80
aVon the Maersk Kendal,
p81
aVa mid-sized container ship
p82
aVcarrying nearly 7,000 boxes,
p83
aVand I departed from Felixstowe,
p84
aVon the south coast of England,
p85
aVand I ended up right here in Singapore
p86
aVfive weeks later,
p87
aVconsiderably less jet-lagged than I am right now.
p88
aVAnd it was a revelation.
p89
aVWe traveled through five seas,
p90
aVtwo oceans, nine ports,
p91
aVand I learned a lot about shipping.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd one of the first things that surprised me
p94
aVwhen I got on board Kendal
p95
aVwas, where are all the people?
p96
aVI have friends in the Navy who tell me
p97
aVthey sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,
p98
aVbut on Kendal there were only 21 crew.
p99
aVNow that's because shipping is very efficient.
p100
aVContainerization has made it very efficient.
p101
aVShips have automation now.
p102
aVThey can operate with small crews.
p103
aVBut it also means that, in the words
p104
aVof a port chaplain I once met,
p105
aVthe average seafarer you're going to find
p106
aVon a container ship is either tired or exhausted,
p107
aVbecause the pace of modern shipping
p108
aVis quite punishing for what the shipping calls
p109
aVits human element,
p110
aVa strange phrase which they don't seem to realize
p111
aVsounds a little bit inhuman.
p112
aVSo most seafarers now working on container ships
p113
aVoften have less than two hours in port at a time.
p114
aVThey don't have time to relax.
p115
aVThey're at sea for months at a time,
p116
aVand even when they're on board,
p117
aVthey don't have access to what
p118
aVa five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal
p121
aVwas who I was sitting next to \u2014
p122
aVNot the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait \u2014
p123
aVBut around that dining table in the officer's saloon,
p124
aVI was sitting next to a Burmese guy,
p125
aVI was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.
p126
aVOn the next table was a Chinese guy,
p127
aVand in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.
p128
aVSo that was a normal working ship.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow how is that possible?
p131
aVBecause the biggest dramatic change
p132
aVin shipping over the last 60 years,
p133
aVwhen most of the general public stopped noticing it,
p134
aVwas something called an open registry,
p135
aVor a flag of convenience.
p136
aVShips can now fly the flag of any nation
p137
aVthat provides a flag registry.
p138
aVYou can get a flag from the landlocked nation
p139
aVof Bolivia, or Mongolia,
p140
aVor North Korea, though that's not very popular.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VSo we have these very multinational,
p144
aVglobal, mobile crews on ships.
p145
aVAnd that was a surprise to me.
p146
aVAnd when we got to pirate waters,
p147
aVdown the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean,
p148
aVthe ship changed.
p149
aVAnd that was also shocking, because suddenly,
p150
aVI realized, as the captain said to me,
p151
aVthat I had been crazy to choose to go
p152
aVthrough pirate waters on a container ship.
p153
aVWe were no longer allowed on deck.
p154
aVThere were double pirate watches.
p155
aVAnd at that time, there were those  544 seafarers being held hostage,
p156
aVand some of them were held hostage for years
p157
aVbecause of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience.
p158
aVNot all of them, but some of them were,
p159
aVbecause for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners,
p160
aVit can be easy to hide behind
p161
aVthe anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat else does our sea blindness mask?
p164
aVWell, if you go out to sea on a ship
p165
aVor on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,
p166
aVyou'll see very black smoke.
p167
aVAnd that's because shipping
p168
aVhas very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel,
p169
aVso they use something called bunker fuel,
p170
aVwhich was described to me by someone in the tanker industry
p171
aVas the dregs of the refinery,
p172
aVor just one step up from asphalt.
p173
aVAnd shipping is the greenest method of transport.
p174
aVIn terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,
p175
aVit emits about a thousandth of aviation
p176
aVand about a tenth of trucking.
p177
aVBut it's not benign, because there's so much of it.
p178
aVSo shipping emissions are about three to four percent,
p179
aValmost the same as aviation's.
p180
aVAnd if you put shipping emissions
p181
aVon a list of the countries' carbon emissions,
p182
aVit would come in about sixth,
p183
aVsomewhere near Germany.
p184
aVIt was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships
p185
aVpollute in terms of particles and soot
p186
aVand noxious gases
p187
aVas much as all the cars in the world.
p188
aVAnd the good news is that
p189
aVpeople are now talking about sustainable shipping.
p190
aVThere are interesting initiatives going on.
p191
aVBut why has it taken so long?
p192
aVWhen are we going to start talking and thinking
p193
aVabout shipping miles as well as air miles?
p194
aa(lp195
VI also traveled to Cape Cod to look
p196
aVat the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,
p197
aVbecause this to me was one of the most surprising things
p198
aVabout my time at sea,
p199
aVand what it made me think about.
p200
aVWe know about man's impact on the ocean
p201
aVin terms of fishing and overfishing,
p202
aVbut we don't really know much about
p203
aVwhat's happening underneath the water.
p204
aVAnd in fact, shipping has a role to play here,
p205
aVbecause shipping noise has contributed
p206
aVto damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures.
p207
aVLight doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water,
p208
aVso ocean creatures like whales and dolphins
p209
aVand even 800 species of fish
p210
aVcommunicate by sound.
p211
aVAnd a North Atlantic right whale
p212
aVcan transmit across hundreds of miles.
p213
aVA humpback can transmit a sound
p214
aVacross a whole ocean.
p215
aVBut a supertanker can also be heard
p216
aVcoming across a whole ocean,
p217
aVand because the noise that propellers make underwater
p218
aVis sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,
p219
aVthen it can damage their acoustic habitat,
p220
aVand they need this for breeding,
p221
aVfor finding feeding grounds,
p222
aVfor finding mates.
p223
aVAnd the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale
p224
aVhas been reduced by up to 90 percent.
p225
aVBut there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd when I arrived in Singapore,
p228
aVand I apologize for this, but I  didn't want to get off my ship.
p229
aVI'd really loved being on board Kendal.
p230
aVI'd been well treated by the crew,
p231
aVI'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,
p232
aVand I would happily have signed up for another five weeks,
p233
aVsomething that the captain also said
p234
aVI was crazy to think about.
p235
aVBut I wasn't there for nine months at a time
p236
aVlike the Filipino seafarers,
p237
aVwho, when I asked them to describe their job to me,
p238
aVcalled it "dollar for homesickness."
p239
aVThey had good salaries,
p240
aVbut theirs is still an isolating and difficult life
p241
aVin a dangerous and often difficult element.
p242
aa(lp243
VBut when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,
p244
aVbecause I want to salute those seafarers
p245
aVwho bring us 90 percent of everything
p246
aVand get very little thanks or recognition for it.
p247
aVI want to salute the 100,000 ships
p248
aVthat are at sea
p249
aVthat are doing that work, coming in and out
p250
aVevery day, bringing us what we need.
p251
aVBut I also want to see shipping,
p252
aVand us, the general public, who know so little about it,
p253
aVto have a bit more scrutiny,
p254
aVto be a bit more transparent,
p255
aVto have 90 percent transparency.
p256
aVBecause I think we could all benefit
p257
aVfrom doing something very simple,
p258
aVwhich is learning to see the sea.
p259
aa(lp260
