VWhat if I told you that time has a race,
p4
aVa race in the contemporary way that we understand race
p5
aVin the United States?
p6
aVTypically, we talk about race in terms of black and white issues.
p7
aVIn the African-American communities from which I come,
p8
aVwe have a long-standing multi-generational joke
p9
aVabout what we call "CP time,"
p10
aVor "colored people's time."
p11
aVNow, we no longer refer to African-Americans as "colored,"
p12
aVbut this long-standing joke
p13
aVabout our perpetual lateness to church,
p14
aVto cookouts, to family events
p15
aVand even to our own funerals, remains.
p16
aa(lp17
VI personally am a stickler for time.
p18
aVIt's almost as if my mother, when I was growing up, said,
p19
aV"We will not be those black people."
p20
aVSo we typically arrive to events 30 minutes early.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut today, I want to talk to you more about the political nature of time,
p23
aVfor if time had a race,
p24
aVit would be white.
p25
aVWhite people own time.
p26
aa(lp27
VI know, I know.
p28
aVMaking such "incendiary statements" makes us uncomfortable:
p29
aVHaven't we moved past the point where race really matters?
p30
aVIsn't race a heavy-handed concept?
p31
aVShouldn't we go ahead with our enlightened, progressive selves
p32
aVand relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history?
p33
aVHow will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race?
p34
aVPerhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule,
p35
aVbury them and dig them up in a thousand years,
p36
aVpeer at them with the clearly more enlightened,
p37
aVraceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future.
p38
aVBut you see there,
p39
aVthat desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up
p40
aVin how we attempt to manage time,
p41
aVin the ways we narrate history,
p42
aVin the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present
p43
aVinto the past,
p44
aVin the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for
p45
aVis the present in which we're currently living.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, when Barack Obama became President of the US in 2008,
p48
aVmany Americans declared that we were post-racial.
p49
aVI'm from the academy
p50
aVwhere we're enamored with being post-everything.
p51
aVWe're postmodern, we're post-structural, we're post-feminist.
p52
aV"Post" has become a simple academic appendage
p53
aVthat we apply to a range of terms
p54
aVto mark the way we were.
p55
aVBut prefixes alone don't have the power to make race and racism
p56
aVa thing of the past.
p57
aVThe US was never "pre-race."
p58
aVSo to claim that we're post-race when we have yet to grapple with the impact
p59
aVof race on black people, Latinos or the indigenous
p60
aVis disingenuous.
p61
aVJust about the moment we were preparing to celebrate
p62
aVour post-racial future,
p63
aVour political conditions became the most racial they've been
p64
aVin the last 50 years.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo today, I want to offer to you three observations,
p67
aVabout the past, the present and the future of time,
p68
aVas it relates to the combating of racism and white dominance.
p69
aa(lp70
VFirst: the past.
p71
aVTime has a history,
p72
aVand so do black people.
p73
aVBut we treat time as though it is timeless,
p74
aVas though it has always been this way,
p75
aVas though it doesn't have a political history
p76
aVbound up with the plunder of indigenous lands,
p77
aVthe genocide of indigenous people
p78
aVand the stealing of Africans from their homeland.
p79
aVWhen white male European philosophers
p80
aVfirst thought to conceptualize time and history, one famously declared,
p81
aV"[Africa] is no historical part of the World."
p82
aVHe was essentially saying
p83
aVthat Africans were people outside of history
p84
aVwho had had no impact on time
p85
aVor the march of progress.
p86
aa(lp87
VThis idea, that black people have had no impact on history,
p88
aVis one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy.
p89
aVIt's the reason that Carter G. Woodson created "Negro History Week" in 1926.
p90
aVIt's the reason that we continue to celebrate Black History Month
p91
aVin the US every February.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, we also see this idea
p94
aVthat black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time
p95
aVor stuck in the past,
p96
aVin a scenario where, much as I'm doing right now,
p97
aVa black person stands up and insists that racism still matters,
p98
aVand a person, usually white,
p99
aVsays to them,
p100
aV"Why are you stuck in the past?
p101
aVWhy can't you move on?
p102
aVWe have a black president.
p103
aVWe're past all that."
p104
aa(lp105
VWilliam Faulkner famously said,
p106
aV"The past is never dead.
p107
aVIt's not even past."
p108
aVBut my good friend Professor Kristie Dotson says,
p109
aV"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."
p110
aVWe carry, all of us,
p111
aVfamily and communal hopes and dreams with us.
p112
aVWe don't have the luxury of letting go of the past.
p113
aVBut sometimes,
p114
aVour political conditions are so troubling
p115
aVthat we don't know if we're living in the past
p116
aVor we're living in the present.
p117
aVTake, for instance, when Black Lives Matter protesters
p118
aVgo out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police,
p119
aVand the pictures that emerge from the protest
p120
aVlook like they could have been taken 50 years ago.
p121
aVThe past won't let us go.
p122
aVBut still, let us press our way into the present.
p123
aa(lp124
VAt present, I would argue
p125
aVthat the racial struggles we are experiencing
p126
aVare clashes over time and space.
p127
aVWhat do I mean?
p128
aVWell, I've already told you that white people own time.
p129
aVThose in power dictate the pace of the workday.
p130
aVThey dictate how much money our time is actually worth.
p131
aVAnd Professor George Lipsitz argues
p132
aVthat white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion.
p133
aVThey dictate how long it will actually take
p134
aVfor minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for.
p135
aa(lp136
VLet me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example.
p137
aVIf you think about the Civil Rights Movement
p138
aVand the cries of its leaders for "Freedom Now,"
p139
aVthey were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion.
p140
aVBy 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act was passed,
p141
aVthere had been a full 100 years
p142
aVbetween the end of the Civil War
p143
aVand the conferral of voting rights on African-American communities.
p144
aVDespite the urgency of a war,
p145
aVit still took a full 100 years for actual social inclusion to occur.
p146
aa(lp147
VSince 2012,
p148
aVconservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts
p149
aVto roll back African-American voting rights
p150
aVby passing restrictive voter ID laws
p151
aVand curtailing early voting opportunities.
p152
aVThis past July, a federal court struck down North Carolina's voter ID law
p153
aVsaying it "... targeted African-Americans with surgical precision."
p154
aa(lp155
VRestricting African-American inclusion in the body politic
p156
aVis a primary way that we attempt to manage and control people
p157
aVby managing and controlling time.
p158
aVBut another place that we see these time-space clashes
p159
aVis in gentrifying cities like Atlanta, Brooklyn,
p160
aVPhiladelphia, New Orleans and Washington, DC \u2014
p161
aVplaces that have had black populations for generations.
p162
aVBut now, in the name of urban renewal and progress,
p163
aVthese communities are pushed out,
p164
aVin service of bringing them into the 21st century.
p165
aa(lp166
VProfessor Sharon Holland asked:
p167
aVWhat happens when a person who exists in time
p168
aVmeets someone who only occupies space?
p169
aVThese racial struggles
p170
aVare battles over those who are perceived to be space-takers
p171
aVand those who are perceived to be world-makers.
p172
aVThose who control the flow and thrust of history
p173
aVare considered world-makers who own and master time.
p174
aVIn other words: white people.
p175
aVBut when Hegel famously said that Africa was no historical part of the world,
p176
aVhe implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass
p177
aVtaking up space at the bottom of the globe.
p178
aVAfricans were space-takers.
p179
aVSo today, white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history,
p180
aVwhile too often treating black people as though we are merely taking up space
p181
aVto which we are not entitled.
p182
aVTime and the march of progress is used to justify
p183
aVa stunning degree of violence towards our most vulnerable populations,
p184
aVwho, being perceived as space-takers rather than world-makers,
p185
aVare moved out of the places where they live,
p186
aVin service of bringing them into the 21st century.
p187
aa(lp188
VShortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways
p189
aVthat time and space cohere in an unjust manner
p190
aVin the lives of black people.
p191
aVChildren who are born in New Orleans zip code 70124,
p192
aVwhich is 93 percent white,
p193
aVcan expect to live a full 25 years longer
p194
aVthan children born in New Orleans zip code 70112,
p195
aVwhich is 60 percent black.
p196
aVChildren born in Washington, DC's wealthy Maryland suburbs
p197
aVcan expect to live a full 20 years longer
p198
aVthan children born in its downtown neighborhoods.
p199
aa(lp200
VTa-Nehisi Coates argues
p201
aVthat, "The defining feature of being drafted into the Black race
p202
aVis the inescapable robbery of time."
p203
aVWe experience time discrimination,
p204
aVhe tells us,
p205
aVnot just as structural,
p206
aVbut as personal:
p207
aVin lost moments of joy,
p208
aVlost moments of connection,
p209
aVlost quality of time with loved ones
p210
aVand lost years of healthy quality of life.
p211
aa(lp212
VIn the future, do you see black people?
p213
aVDo black people have a future?
p214
aVWhat if you belong to the very race of people
p215
aVwho have always been pitted against time?
p216
aVWhat if your group is the group for whom a future was never imagined?
p217
aVThese time-space clashes \u2014
p218
aVbetween protesters and police,
p219
aVbetween gentrifiers and residents \u2014
p220
aVdon't paint a very pretty picture
p221
aVof what America hopes for black people's future.
p222
aVIf the present is any indicator,
p223
aVour children will be under-educated,
p224
aVhealth maladies will take their toll
p225
aVand housing will continue to be unaffordable.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo if we're really ready to talk about the future,
p228
aVperhaps we should begin by admitting that we're out of time.
p229
aVWe black people have always been out of time.
p230
aVTime does not belong to us.
p231
aVOur lives are lives of perpetual urgency.
p232
aVTime is used to displace us,
p233
aVor conversely, we are urged into complacency
p234
aVthrough endless calls to just be patient.
p235
aVBut if past is prologue,
p236
aVlet us seize upon the ways in which we're always out of time anyway
p237
aVto demand with urgency
p238
aVfreedom now.
p239
aa(lp240
VI believe the future is what we make it.
p241
aVBut first, we have to decide that time belongs to all of us.
p242
aVNo, we don't all get equal time,
p243
aVbut we can decide that the time we do get is just and free.
p244
aVWe can stop making your zip code the primary determinant
p245
aVof your lifespan.
p246
aVWe can stop stealing learning time from black children
p247
aVthrough excessive use of suspensions and expulsions.
p248
aVWe can stop stealing time from black people
p249
aVthrough long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.
p250
aVThe police can stop stealing time and black lives
p251
aVthrough use of excessive force.
p252
aa(lp253
VI believe the future is what we make it.
p254
aVBut we can't get there on colored people's time
p255
aVor white time
p256
aVor your time
p257
aVor even my time.
p258
aVIt's our time.
p259
aVOurs.
