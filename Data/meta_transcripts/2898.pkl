VSince 2009, the world has been stuck
p4
aVon a single narrative around a coming global food crisis
p5
aVand what we need to do to avoid it.
p6
aVHow do we feed nine billion people by 2050?
p7
aVEvery conference, podcast and dialogue around global food security
p8
aVstarts with this question
p9
aVand goes on to answer it
p10
aVby saying we need to produce 70 percent more food.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe 2050 narrative started to evolve
p13
aVshortly after global food prices hit all-time highs in 2008.
p14
aVPeople were suffering and struggling,
p15
aVgovernments and world leaders
p16
aVneeded to show us that they were paying attention
p17
aVand were working to solve it.
p18
aVThe thing is, 2050 is so far into the future
p19
aVthat we can't even relate to it,
p20
aVand more importantly,
p21
aVif we keep doing what we're doing,
p22
aVit's going to hit us a lot sooner than that.
p23
aa(lp24
VI believe we need to ask a different question.
p25
aVThe answer to that question
p26
aVneeds to be framed differently.
p27
aVIf we can reframe the old narrative
p28
aVand replace it with new numbers
p29
aVthat tell us a more complete pictures,
p30
aVnumbers that everyone can understand
p31
aVand relate to,
p32
aVwe can avoid the crisis altogether.
p33
aa(lp34
VI was a commodities trader in my past life
p35
aVand one of the things that I learned trading
p36
aVis that every market has a tipping point,
p37
aVthe point at which change occurs so rapidly
p38
aVthat it impacts the world
p39
aVand things change forever.
p40
aVThink of the last financial crisis,
p41
aVor the dot-com crash.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo here's my concern.
p44
aVWe could have a tipping point
p45
aVin global food and agriculture
p46
aVif surging demand
p47
aVsurpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food.
p48
aVThis means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand
p49
aVdespite exploding prices,
p50
aVunless we can commit to some type of structural change.
p51
aVThis time around,
p52
aVit won't be about stock markets and money.
p53
aVIt's about people.
p54
aVPeople could starve and governments may fall.
p55
aVThis question of at what point does supply struggle
p56
aVto keep up with surging demand
p57
aVis one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading
p58
aVand became an absolute obsession.
p59
aVIt went from interest to obsession
p60
aVwhen I realized through my research how broken the system was
p61
aVand how very little data was being used to make such critical decisions.
p62
aVThat's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street
p63
aVand start an entrepreneurial journey
p64
aVto start Gro Intelligence.
p65
aa(lp66
VAt Gro, we focus on bringing this data
p67
aVand doing the work to make it actionable,
p68
aVto empower decision-makers at every level.
p69
aVBut doing this work,
p70
aVwe also realized that the world,
p71
aVnot just world leaders,
p72
aVbut businesses and citizens like every single person in this room,
p73
aVlacked an actionable guide
p74
aVon how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis.
p75
aVAnd so we built a model,
p76
aVleveraging the petabytes of data we sit on,
p77
aVand we solved for the tipping point.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, no one knows we've been working on this problem
p80
aVand this is the first time that I'm sharing what we discovered.
p81
aVWe discovered that the tipping point is actually a decade from now.
p82
aVWe discovered that the world
p83
aVwill be short 214 trillion calories
p84
aVby 2027.
p85
aVThe world is not in a position to fill this gap.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, you'll notice
p88
aVthat the way I'm framing this is different from how I started,
p89
aVand that's intentional, because until now
p90
aVthis problem has been quantified using mass:
p91
aVthink kilograms, tons, hectograms,
p92
aVwhatever your unit of choice is in mass.
p93
aVWhy do we talk about food in terms of weight?
p94
aVBecause it's easy.
p95
aVWe can look at a photograph and determine tonnage on a ship
p96
aVby using a simple pocket calculator.
p97
aVWe can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts.
p98
aVBut what we care about in food is nutritional value.
p99
aVNot all foods are created equal,
p100
aVeven if they weigh the same.
p101
aVThis I learned firsthand
p102
aVwhen I moved from Ethiopia to the US for university.
p103
aVUpon my return back home,
p104
aVmy father, who was so excited to see me,
p105
aVgreeted me by asking why I was fat.
p106
aVNow, turns out that eating
p107
aVapproximately the same amount of food as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,
p108
aVhad actually lent a certain fullness to my figure.
p109
aVThis is why we should care about calories,
p110
aVnot about mass.
p111
aVIt is calories which sustain us.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo 214 trillion calories is a very large number,
p114
aVand not even the most dedicated of us
p115
aVthink in the hundreds of trillions of calories.
p116
aVSo let me break this down differently.
p117
aVAn alternative way to think about this
p118
aVis to think about it in Big Macs.
p119
aV214 trillion calories.
p120
aVA single Big Mac has 563 calories.
p121
aVThat means the world will be short 379 billion Big Macs in 2027.
p122
aVThat is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo how did we get to these numbers in the first place?
p125
aVThey're not made up.
p126
aVThis map shows you where the world was 40 years ago.
p127
aVIt shows you net calorie gaps in every country in the world.
p128
aVNow, simply put,
p129
aVthis is just calories consumed in that country
p130
aVminus calories produced in that same country.
p131
aVThis is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else.
p132
aVIt's simply saying how many calories are consumed in a single year
p133
aVminus how many are produced.
p134
aVBlue countries are net calorie exporters,
p135
aVor self-sufficient.
p136
aVThey have some in storage for a rainy day.
p137
aVRed countries are net calorie importers.
p138
aVThe deeper, the brighter the red,
p139
aVthe more you're importing.
p140
aV40 years ago, such few countries were net exporters of calories,
p141
aVI could count them with one hand.
p142
aVMost of the African continent,
p143
aVEurope, most of Asia,
p144
aVSouth America excluding Argentina,
p145
aVwere all net importers of calories.
p146
aVAnd what's surprising is that China used to actually be food self-sufficient.
p147
aVIndia was a big net importer of calories.
p148
aa(lp149
V40 years later, this is today.
p150
aVYou can see the drastic transformation that's occurred in the world.
p151
aVBrazil has emerged as an agricultural powerhouse.
p152
aVEurope is dominant in global agriculture.
p153
aVIndia has actually flipped from red to blue.
p154
aVIt's become food self-sufficient.
p155
aVAnd China went from that light blue
p156
aVto the brightest red that you see on this map.
p157
aa(lp158
VHow did we get here? What happened?
p159
aVSo this chart shows you India and Africa.
p160
aVBlue line is India, red line is Africa.
p161
aVHow is it that two regions that started off so similarly
p162
aVin such similar trajectories
p163
aVtake such different paths?
p164
aVIndia had a green revolution.
p165
aVNot a single African country had a green revolution.
p166
aVThe net outcome?
p167
aVIndia is food self-sufficient
p168
aVand in the past decade has actually been exporting calories.
p169
aVThe African continent now imports over 300 trillion calories a year.
p170
aVThen we add China, the green line.
p171
aVRemember the switch from the blue to the bright red?
p172
aVWhat happened and when did it happen?
p173
aVChina seemed to be on a very similar path to India
p174
aVuntil the start of the 21st century,
p175
aVwhere it suddenly flipped.
p176
aVA young and growing population
p177
aVcombined with significant economic growth
p178
aVmade its mark with a big bang
p179
aVand no one in the markets saw it coming.
p180
aVThis flip was everything to global agricultural markets.
p181
aVLuckily now, South America
p182
aVwas starting to boom at the same time as China's rise,
p183
aVand so therefore, supply and demand were still somewhat balanced.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo the question becomes,
p186
aVwhere do we go from here?
p187
aVOddly enough,
p188
aVit's not a new story,
p189
aVexcept this time it's not just a story of China.
p190
aVIt's a continuation of China,
p191
aVan amplification of Africa
p192
aVand a paradigm shift in India.
p193
aVBy 2023,
p194
aVAfrica's population is forecasted to overtake that of India's and China's.
p195
aVBy 2023, these three regions combined
p196
aVwill make up over half the world's population.
p197
aVThis crossover point starts to present really interesting challenges
p198
aVfor global food security.
p199
aVAnd a few years later, we're hit hard with that reality.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat does the world look like in 10 years?
p202
aVSo far, as I mentioned, India has been food self-sufficient.
p203
aVMost forecasters predict that this will continue.
p204
aVWe disagree.
p205
aVIndia will soon become a net importer of calories.
p206
aVThis will be driven both by the fact
p207
aVthat demand is growing from a population growth standpoint
p208
aVplus economic growth.
p209
aVIt will be driven by both.
p210
aVAnd even if you have optimistic assumptions
p211
aVaround production growth,
p212
aVit will make that slight flip.
p213
aVThat slight flip can have huge implications.
p214
aa(lp215
VNext, Africa will continue to be a net importer of calories,
p216
aVagain driven by population growth and economic growth.
p217
aVThis is again assuming optimistic production growth assumptions.
p218
aVThen China,
p219
aVwhere population is flattening out,
p220
aVcalorie consumption will explode
p221
aVbecause the types of calories consumed
p222
aVare also starting to be higher-calorie-content foods.
p223
aVAnd so therefore,
p224
aVthese three regions combined
p225
aVstart to present a really interesting challenge for the world.
p226
aa(lp227
VUntil now, countries with calorie deficits
p228
aVhave been able to meet these deficits
p229
aVby importing from surplus regions.
p230
aVBy surplus regions, I'm talking about
p231
aVNorth America, South America and Europe.
p232
aVThis line chart over here shows you
p233
aVthe growth and the projected growth over the next decade of production
p234
aVfrom North America, South America and Europe.
p235
aVWhat it doesn't show you
p236
aVis that most of this growth is actually going to come from South America.
p237
aVAnd most of this growth
p238
aVis going to come at the huge cost of deforestation.
p239
aVAnd so when you look at the combined demand increase
p240
aVcoming from India, China and the African continent,
p241
aVand look at it versus the combined increase in production
p242
aVcoming from India, China, the African continent,
p243
aVNorth America, South America and Europe,
p244
aVyou are left with a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,
p245
aVone we can't produce.
p246
aVAnd this, by the way, is actually assuming we take all the extra calories
p247
aVproduced in North America, South America and Europe
p248
aVand export them solely to India, China and Africa.
p249
aa(lp250
VWhat I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world.
p251
aVWe can do something to change that.
p252
aVWe can change consumption patterns,
p253
aVwe can reduce food waste,
p254
aVor we can make a bold commitment
p255
aVto increasing yields exponentially.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, I'm not going to go into discussing
p258
aVchanging consumption patterns or reducing food waste,
p259
aVbecause those conversations have been going on for some time now.
p260
aVNothing has happened.
p261
aVNothing has happened because those arguments
p262
aVask the surplus regions to change their behavior
p263
aVon behalf of deficit regions.
p264
aVWaiting for others to change their behavior
p265
aVon your behalf, for your survival,
p266
aVis a terrible idea.
p267
aVIt's unproductive.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo I'd like to suggest an alternative that comes from the red regions.
p270
aVChina, India, Africa.
p271
aVChina is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has
p272
aVavailable for agriculture,
p273
aVand it has massive water resource availability issues.
p274
aVSo the answer really lies in India and in Africa.
p275
aVIndia has some upside in terms of potential yield increases.
p276
aVNow this is the gap between its current yield
p277
aVand the theoretical maximum yield it can achieve.
p278
aVIt has some unfarmed arable land remaining, but not much,
p279
aVIndia is quite land-constrained.
p280
aVNow, the African continent, on the other hand,
p281
aVhas vast amounts of arable land remaining
p282
aVand significant upside potential in yields.
p283
aVSomewhat simplified picture here,
p284
aVbut if you look at sub-Saharan African yields in corn today,
p285
aVthey are where North American yields were in 1940.
p286
aVWe don't have 70-plus years to figure this out,
p287
aVso it means we need to try something new
p288
aVand we need to try something different.
p289
aVThe solution starts with reforms.
p290
aVWe need to reform and commercialize
p291
aVthe agricultural industries in Africa
p292
aVand in India.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, by commercialization \u2014
p295
aVcommercialization is not about commercial farming alone.
p296
aVCommercialization is about leveraging data
p297
aVto craft better policies,
p298
aVto improve infrastructure,
p299
aVto lower the transportation costs
p300
aVand to completely reform banking and insurance industries.
p301
aVCommercialization is about taking agriculture
p302
aVfrom too risky an endeavor to one where fortunes can be made.
p303
aVCommercialization is not about just farmers.
p304
aVCommercialization is about the entire agricultural system.
p305
aVBut commercialization also means confronting the fact
p306
aVthat we can no longer place the burden of growth
p307
aVon small-scale farmers alone,
p308
aVand accepting that commercial farms and the introduction of commercial farms
p309
aVcould provide certain economies of scale
p310
aVthat even small-scale farmers can leverage.
p311
aVIt is not about small-scale farming or commercial agriculture,
p312
aVor big agriculture.
p313
aVWe can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success
p314
aVof small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture.
p315
aVThis is because, for the first time ever,
p316
aVthe most critical tool for success in the industry \u2014
p317
aVdata and knowledge \u2014
p318
aVis becoming cheaper by the day.
p319
aVAnd very soon, it won't matter how much money you have
p320
aVor how big you are
p321
aVto make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success
p322
aVin reaching your intended goal.
p323
aVCompanies like Gro are working really hard to make this a reality.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo if we can commit to this new, bold initiative,
p326
aVto this new, bold change,
p327
aVnot only can we solve the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,
p328
aVbut we can actually set the world on a whole new path.
p329
aVIndia can remain food self-sufficient
p330
aVand Africa can emerge as the world's next dark blue region.
p331
aa(lp332
VThe new question is,
p333
aVhow do we produce 214 trillion calories
p334
aVto feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?
p335
aVWe have the solution.
p336
aVWe just need to act on it.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.
