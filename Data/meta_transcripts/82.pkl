VI got a visit almost exactly a year ago,
p4
aVa little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.
p5
aVCame to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out
p6
aVhave come back missing at least one full arm.
p7
aVWhole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.
p8
aVAnd we're doing the same thing we did for \u2014 more or less,
p9
aVthat we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.
p10
aVAnd they deserve more than that."
p11
aVAnd literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,
p12
aV"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids
p13
aVthat'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,
p14
aVthey'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,
p15
aVand they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."
p16
aVYou know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.
p17
aa(lp18
VHe finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,
p19
aVand he said, "That's what I want from you."
p20
aVI said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.
p21
aVAnd it can't be done.
p22
aVNot in an envelope of a human arm,
p23
aVwith 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."
p24
aVHe said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.
p25
aVYou think it's bad to lose one arm?
p26
aVThat's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."
p27
aVI got a day job,
p28
aVand my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,
p29
aVlet's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,
p30
aVwhich, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.
p31
aa(lp32
VI keep thinking about these kids with no arms.
p33
aVHe says to me, "We've done some work around the country.
p34
aVWe've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."
p35
aVI said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."
p36
aVOver the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,
p37
aVfound the best of the best.
p38
aVI went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,
p39
aV"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.
p40
aVI still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."
p41
aa(lp42
VI put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,
p43
aVgot up to 20 some-odd people.
p44
aVWe said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
p45
aVWe have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;
p46
aVyou don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
p47
aVWe put this thing together.
p48
aVA couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,
p49
aVwhich is unfortunately more in the news these days.
p50
aVWe showed it to a bunch of guys.
p51
aVOne guy who described himself as being lucky,
p52
aVbecause he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.
p53
aVHe sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.
p54
aVSaid he was lucky, because he had his good arm,
p55
aVand then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.
p56
aVThese kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,
p59
aVa 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
p60
aVBut understand what you're looking at
p61
aVwe made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,
p62
aVso that we could put it in any of these people.
p63
aVIt's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and
p64
aVMRIs of whatever is their good arm,
p65
aVto make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D \u2014
p66
aVexact mirror image of their other limb.
p67
aVSo, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,
p68
aVeach one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.
p69
aVIt also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,
p70
aVso the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.
p71
aVThey take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.
p72
aVI'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this
p73
aVthat we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?
p74
aa(lp75
VWatch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.
p76
aVThis weighs 6.9 pounds.
p77
aVGoing to scratch his nose.
p78
aVIt's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
p79
aVNow he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
p80
aVNow he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,
p81
aVrotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
