VI'm going to talk
p4
aVabout some of my discoveries
p5
aVaround the world through my work.
p6
aVThese are not discoveries of planets
p7
aVor new technologies
p8
aVor science.
p9
aVThey're discoveries of people
p10
aVand the way people are, and new leadership.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is Benki.
p13
aVBenki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.
p14
aVHis people live in Brazil
p15
aVand in Peru.
p16
aVBenki comes from a village
p17
aVso remote up in the Amazon
p18
aVthat to get there, either you have to fly
p19
aVand land on water,
p20
aVor go by canoe for several days.
p21
aVI met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo
p22
aVwhen I'd brought him and other leaders
p23
aVfrom indigenous peoples
p24
aVto meet with me and leaders from around the world,
p25
aVbecause we wanted to learn from each other.
p26
aVWe wanted to share our stories with each other.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe Ashaninka people
p29
aVare known throughout South America
p30
aVfor their dignity, their spirit
p31
aVand their resistance,
p32
aVstarting with the Incas
p33
aVand continuing through the 19th century
p34
aVwith the rubber tappers.
p35
aVToday's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people
p36
aVand to Benki
p37
aVcomes from illegal logging \u2014
p38
aVthe people who come into the beautiful forest
p39
aVand cut down ancient mahogany trees,
p40
aVfloat them down the river to world markets.
p41
aVBenki knew this.
p42
aVHe could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,
p43
aVbecause he was taken under his grandfather's wing
p44
aVwhen he was only two years old
p45
aVto begin to learn about the forest
p46
aVand the way of life of his people.
p47
aVHis grandfather died when he was only 10.
p48
aVAnd at that young age, 10 years old,
p49
aVBenki became the paje of his community.
p50
aVNow, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,
p51
aVthe paje is the most important
p52
aVperson in the community.
p53
aVThis is the person who contains within him
p54
aVall the knowledge, all the wisdom
p55
aVof centuries and centuries of life,
p56
aVand not just about his people,
p57
aVbut about everything that his people's survival depended on:
p58
aVthe trees, the birds,
p59
aVthe water, the soil, the forest.
p60
aVSo when he was only 10 and he became the paje,
p61
aVhe began to lead his people.
p62
aVHe began to talk to them
p63
aVabout the forest that they needed to protect,
p64
aVthe way of life they needed to nurture.
p65
aVHe explained to them
p66
aVthat it was not a question of survival of the fittest;
p67
aVit was a question of understanding
p68
aVwhat they needed to survive
p69
aVand to protect that.
p70
aa(lp71
VEight years later,
p72
aVwhen he was a young man of 18,
p73
aVBenki left the forest for the first time.
p74
aVHe went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio
p75
aVto the Earth Summit
p76
aVto tell the world what was happening
p77
aVin his tiny, little corner.
p78
aVAnd he went because he hoped the world would listen.
p79
aVSome did, not everybody.
p80
aVBut if you can imagine this young man
p81
aVwith his headdress and his flowing robe,
p82
aVlearning a new language, Portuguese,
p83
aVnot to mention English,
p84
aVgoing to Rio,
p85
aVbuilding a bridge
p86
aVto reach out to people he'd never met before \u2014
p87
aVa pretty hostile world.
p88
aVBut he wasn't dismayed.
p89
aa(lp90
VBenki came back to his village full of ideas \u2014
p91
aVnew technologies, new research,
p92
aVnew ways of understanding what was going on.
p93
aVSince that time,
p94
aVhe's continued to work with his people,
p95
aVand not only the Ashaninka Nation,
p96
aVbut all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.
p97
aVHe's built schools
p98
aVto teach children to care for the forest.
p99
aVTogether, he's led the reforestation
p100
aVof over 25 percent of the land
p101
aVthat had been destroyed by the loggers.
p102
aVHe's created a cooperative
p103
aVto help people diversify their livelihoods.
p104
aVAnd he's brought the internet and satellite technology
p105
aVto the forest \u2014
p106
aVboth so that people themselves
p107
aVcould monitor the deforestation,
p108
aVbut also that he could speak from the forest
p109
aVto the rest of the world.
p110
aVIf you were to meet Benki
p111
aVand ask him, "Why are you doing this?
p112
aVWhy are you putting yourself at risk?
p113
aVWhy are you making yourself vulnerable
p114
aVto what is often a hostile world?"
p115
aVhe would tell you,
p116
aVas he told me,
p117
aV"I asked myself," he said,
p118
aV"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do
p119
aVto protect the forest for me?
p120
aVAnd what am I doing?"
p121
aa(lp122
VSo when I think of that,
p123
aVI wonder what our grandchildren
p124
aVand our great-grandchildren,
p125
aVwhen they ask themselves that question,
p126
aVI wonder how they will answer.
p127
aVFor me, the world is veering
p128
aVtowards a future we don't much want
p129
aVwhen we really think about it deep inside.
p130
aVIt's a future we don't know the details of,
p131
aVbut it's a future that has signs,
p132
aVjust like Benki saw the signs around him.
p133
aVWe know we are running out of what we need.
p134
aVWe're running out of fresh water.
p135
aVWe're running out of fossil fuels.
p136
aVWe're running out of land.
p137
aVWe know climate change is going to affect all of us.
p138
aVWe don't know how, but we know it will.
p139
aVAnd we know that there will be more of us than ever before \u2014
p140
aVfive times as many people in 40 years
p141
aVthan 60 years ago.
p142
aVWe are running out of what we need.
p143
aVAnd we also know
p144
aVthat the world has changed in other ways,
p145
aVthat since 1960
p146
aVthere are one-third as many new countries
p147
aVthat exist as independent entities on the planet.
p148
aVEgos, systems of government \u2014
p149
aVfiguring it out \u2014
p150
aVmassive change.
p151
aVAnd in addition to that,
p152
aVwe know that five other really big countries
p153
aVare going to have a say in the future,
p154
aVa say we haven't even really started to hear yet \u2014
p155
aVChina, India,
p156
aVRussia, South Africa
p157
aVand Benki's own Brazil,
p158
aVwhere Benki got his civil rights
p159
aVonly in the 1988 constitution.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut you know all that.
p162
aVYou know more than Benki knew when he left his forest
p163
aVand went 3,000 miles.
p164
aVYou also know
p165
aVthat we can't just keep doing what we've always done,
p166
aVbecause we'll get the results
p167
aVwe've always gotten.
p168
aVAnd this reminds me of something I understand
p169
aVLord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,
p170
aVwhen she was pressing him, "Please change."
p171
aVHe said, "Change?
p172
aVWhy change?
p173
aVThings are bad enough as they are."
p174
aVWe have to change.
p175
aVIt's imperative to me, when I look around the world,
p176
aVthat we need to change ourselves.
p177
aVWe need new models of what it means to be a leader.
p178
aVWe need new models
p179
aVof being a leader and a human in the world.
p180
aa(lp181
VI started life as a banker.
p182
aVNow I don't admit to that
p183
aVto anybody but my very close friends.
p184
aVBut for the past eight years,
p185
aVI've done something completely different.
p186
aVMy work has taken me around the world,
p187
aVwhere I've had the real privilege
p188
aVof meeting people like Benki
p189
aVand many others who are making change happen
p190
aVin their communities \u2014
p191
aVpeople who see the world differently,
p192
aVwho are asking different questions,
p193
aVwho have different answers,
p194
aVwho understand the filters that they wear
p195
aVwhen they go out into the world.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is Sanghamitra.
p198
aVSanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
p199
aVI met Sanghamitra eight years ago
p200
aVwhen I was in Bangalore
p201
aVorganizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's
p202
aVworking in some of the hardest aspects of society.
p203
aVSanghamitra didn't start life
p204
aVas a leader of an NGO,
p205
aVshe started her career as university professor,
p206
aVteaching English literature.
p207
aVBut she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.
p208
aVShe loved it, but she was too detached.
p209
aVAnd so in 1993,
p210
aVa long time ago,
p211
aVshe decided to start a new organization
p212
aVcalled Samraksha
p213
aVfocused on one of the hardest areas,
p214
aVone of the hardest issues in India \u2014
p215
aVanywhere in the world at the time \u2014
p216
aVHIV/AIDS.
p217
aVSince that time, Samraksha has grown
p218
aVfrom strength to strength
p219
aVand is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.
p220
aVBut if you just think about the state of the world
p221
aVand knowledge of HIV/AIDS
p222
aVin 1993 \u2014
p223
aVin India at that time it was skyrocketing
p224
aVand nobody understood why,
p225
aVand everyone was actually very, very afraid.
p226
aVToday there are still three million
p227
aVHIV-positive people in India.
p228
aVThat's the second largest population in the world.
p229
aa(lp230
VWhen I asked Sanghamitra,
p231
aV"How did you get from English literature
p232
aVto HIV/AIDS?"
p233
aVnot an obvious path,
p234
aVshe said to me,
p235
aV"It's all connected.
p236
aVLiterature makes one sensitive,
p237
aVsensitive to people,
p238
aVto their dreams and to their ideas."
p239
aVSince that time, under her leadership,
p240
aVSamraksha has been a pioneer
p241
aVin all fields related
p242
aVto HIV/AIDS.
p243
aVThey have respite homes, the first,
p244
aVthe first care centers,
p245
aVthe first counseling services \u2014
p246
aVand not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,
p247
aVbut in the hardest to reach villages
p248
aVin the state of Karnataka.
p249
aVEven that wasn't enough.
p250
aVShe wanted to change policy at the government level.
p251
aV10 of their programs that she pioneered
p252
aVare now government policy and funded by the government.
p253
aVThey take care of 20,000-odd people today
p254
aVin over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.
p255
aa(lp256
VShe works with people like Murali Krishna.
p257
aVMurali Krishna comes from one of those villages.
p258
aVHe lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,
p259
aVand he's HIV-positive.
p260
aVBut he saw the work, the care,
p261
aVthe compassion
p262
aVthat Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,
p263
aVand he wanted to be part of it.
p264
aVHe's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.
p265
aVThey've pioneered a different approach to villages.
p266
aVInstead of handing out information in pamphlets,
p267
aVas is so often the case,
p268
aVthey bring theater troupes,
p269
aVsongs, music, dance.
p270
aVAnd they sit around,
p271
aVand they talk about dreams.
p272
aa(lp273
VSanghamitra told me just last week \u2014
p274
aVshe had just come back from two weeks in the villages,
p275
aVand she had a real breakthrough.
p276
aVThey were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.
p277
aVAnd the young women in the village
p278
aVspoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.
p279
aVOur dream
p280
aVis for our partners, our husbands,
p281
aVnot to be given to us because of a horoscope,
p282
aVbut to be given to us
p283
aVbecause they've been tested for HIV."
p284
aVIf you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra
p285
aVand ask her why and how,
p286
aVhow have you achieved so much?
p287
aVShe would look at you
p288
aVand very quietly, very softly say,
p289
aV"It just happened.
p290
aVIt's the spirit inside."
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.
p293
aVJianchuan comes from Sichuan Province
p294
aVin southwest China.
p295
aVHe was born in 1957,
p296
aVand you can imagine what his childhood
p297
aVlooked like and felt like,
p298
aVand what his life has been like
p299
aVover the last 50 tumultuous years.
p300
aVHe's been a soldier, a teacher,
p301
aVa politician, a vice-mayor
p302
aVand a business man.
p303
aVBut if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,
p304
aVand what do you do?"
p305
aVHe would tell you, "I'm a collector,
p306
aVand I curate a museum."
p307
aVI was lucky; I had heard about him for years,
p308
aVand I finally met him earlier this year
p309
aVat his museum in Chengdu.
p310
aa(lp311
VHe's been a collector all of his life,
p312
aVstarting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.
p313
aVNow, just think of the early 1960's in China.
p314
aVOver a lifetime, through everything,
p315
aVthrough the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,
p316
aVhe's kept collecting,
p317
aVso that he now has over eight million pieces
p318
aVin his museums
p319
aVdocumenting contemporary Chinese history.
p320
aVThese are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,
p321
aVin part because they document parts of history
p322
aVChinese choose to forget.
p323
aVFor example, he's got over one million pieces
p324
aVdocumenting the Sino-Japanese War,
p325
aVa war that's not talked about in China very much
p326
aVand whose heroes are not honored.
p327
aVWhy did he do all this?
p328
aVBecause he thought
p329
aVa nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo, from commissioning
p332
aVslightly larger than life bronze statues
p333
aVof the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,
p334
aVincluding those Chinese
p335
aVwho then fought with each other
p336
aVand left mainland China to go to Taiwan,
p337
aVto commemorating all the unknown,
p338
aVordinary soldiers who survived,
p339
aVby asking them to take prints of their hands,
p340
aVhe is making sure \u2014 one man is making sure \u2014
p341
aVthat history is not forgotten.
p342
aVBut it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
p343
aVThis building contains the world's largest collection
p344
aVof documents and artifacts
p345
aVcommemorating the U.S. role
p346
aVin fighting on the Chinese side
p347
aVin that long war \u2014
p348
aVthe Flying Tigers.
p349
aVHe has nine other buildings \u2014
p350
aVthat are already open to the public \u2014
p351
aVfilled to the rafters with artifacts
p352
aVdocumenting contemporary Chinese history.
p353
aVTwo of the most sensitive buildings
p354
aVinclude a lifetime of collection
p355
aVabout the Cultural Revolution,
p356
aVa period that actually most Chinese
p357
aVwould prefer to forget.
p358
aVBut he doesn't want his nation
p359
aVever to forget.
p360
aa(lp361
VThese people inspire me,
p362
aVand they inspire me because they show us
p363
aVwhat is possible when you change the way
p364
aVyou look at the world,
p365
aVchange the way you look at your place in the world.
p366
aVThey looked outside,
p367
aVand then they changed what was on the inside.
p368
aVThey didn't go to business school.
p369
aVThey didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader
p370
aVin 10 Easy Steps."
p371
aVBut they have qualities we'd all recognize.
p372
aVThey have drive, passion, commitment.
p373
aVThey've gone away
p374
aVfrom what they did before,
p375
aVand they've gone
p376
aVto something they didn't know.
p377
aVThey've tried to connect worlds
p378
aVthey didn't know existed before.
p379
aVThey've built bridges, and they've walked across them.
p380
aVThey have a sense of the great arc of time
p381
aVand their tiny place in it.
p382
aVThey know people have come before them
p383
aVand will follow them.
p384
aVAnd they know that they're part of a whole,
p385
aVthat they depend on other people.
p386
aVIt's not about them, they know that,
p387
aVbut it has to start with them.
p388
aVAnd they have humility.
p389
aVIt just happens.
p390
aa(lp391
VBut we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?
p392
aVWe know it takes a lot to make it happen,
p393
aVand we know the direction the world is going in.
p394
aVSo I think we need succession planning
p395
aVon a global basis.
p396
aVWe can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,
p397
aVto come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.
p398
aVI think it has to start with us.
p399
aVAnd we know, just like they knew,
p400
aVhow hard it is.
p401
aVBut the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;
p402
aVwe have models, we have examples,
p403
aVlike Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.
p404
aVWe can look at what they've done, if we look.
p405
aVWe can learn from what they've learned.
p406
aVWe can change the way we see ourselves in the world.
p407
aVAnd if we're lucky,
p408
aVwe can change the way
p409
aVour great-grandchildren
p410
aVwill answer Benki's question.
p411
