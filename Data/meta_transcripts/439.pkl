VThe future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.
p4
aVI think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.
p5
aVI'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.
p6
aVAlex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,
p7
aVand since then we and our growing global team of contributors
p8
aVhave documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions
p9
aVthat are out there, right now and on the near horizon.
p10
aa(lp11
VIn a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items \u2014
p12
aVreplicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas \u2014
p13
aVall providing a path to a future
p14
aVthat's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.
p15
aVOur emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
p16
aVThere are tons of places to go, online and off,
p17
aVif what you want to find is the latest bit of news
p18
aVabout just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.
p19
aVWe want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
p20
aVWe focus primarily on the planet's environment,
p21
aVbut we also address issues of global development,
p22
aVinternational conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,
p23
aVeven the rise of the so-called Second Superpower
p24
aVand much, much more.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,
p27
aVbut that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met
p28
aVand the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.
p29
aVA quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,
p30
aVbut to give you a sense of what we cover:
p31
aVtools for rapid disaster relief,
p32
aVsuch as this inflatable concrete shelter;
p33
aVinnovative uses of bioscience,
p34
aVsuch as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;
p35
aVultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;
p36
aVdistributed power generation using solar power, wind power,
p37
aVocean power, other clean energy sources;
p38
aVultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;
p39
aVultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;
p40
aVand better urban design,
p41
aVso you don't need to drive as much in the first place;
p42
aVbio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of
p43
aVthe efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;
p44
aVdistributed computing projects
p45
aVthat will help us model the future of the climate.
p46
aVAlso, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week
p47
aVat TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:
p48
aVcradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,
p49
aVthe consequences of extreme longevity,
p50
aVthe One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.
p51
aa(lp52
VAs a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,
p53
aVhurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,
p54
aVI'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging
p55
aVhas convinced me, much to my own surprise,
p56
aVthat successful responses to the world's problems
p57
aVare nonetheless possible.
p58
aVMoreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes
p59
aVcan really blind you to the very possibility of success.
p60
aVAs Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,
p61
aV"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...
p62
aVIn difficult times, pessimism is
p63
aVa self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."
p64
aVThe truth is, we can build a better world,
p65
aVand we can do so right now.
p66
aVWe have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,
p67
aVand we're coming up with new ones all the time.
p68
aVWe have the knowledge,
p69
aVand our understanding of the planet improves every day.
p70
aVMost importantly, we have the motive:
p71
aVwe have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.
p72
aa(lp73
VMany of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out
p74
aVand write up every day have some important aspects in common:
p75
aVtransparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,
p76
aVand an appreciation of science \u2014 or, more appropriately, science!
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVThe majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging
p79
aVencompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you
p80
aVa few concrete examples of how these principles combine
p81
aVin world-changing ways.
p82
aa(lp83
VWe can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools
p84
aVto make the invisible visible \u2014 that is,
p85
aVto make apparent the conditions of the world around us
p86
aVthat would otherwise be largely imperceptible.
p87
aVWe know that people often change their behavior
p88
aVwhen they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
p89
aVAs a small example, many of us have experienced
p90
aVthe change in driving behavior that comes from having
p91
aVa real time display of mileage showing precisely
p92
aVhow one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.
p93
aVThe last few years have all seen the rise of innovations
p94
aVin how we measure and display aspects of the world
p95
aVthat can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.
p96
aVSimple technologies, like wall-mounted devices
p97
aVthat display how much power your household is using,
p98
aVand what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights \u2014
p99
aVthese can actually have a direct positive impact
p100
aVon your energy footprint.
p101
aVCommunity tools, like text messaging, that can tell you
p102
aVwhen pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising
p103
aVor a natural disaster is unfolding,
p104
aVcan give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
p105
aVData-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,
p106
aVor maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,
p107
aVallow us to better understand the context and the flow
p108
aVof processes that affect us all.
p109
aa(lp110
VWe can see world-changing values in research projects
p111
aVthat seek to meet the world's medical needs
p112
aVthrough open access to data and collaborative action.
p113
aVNow, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,
p114
aVbut I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions
p115
aVare far more important.
p116
aVFor example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,
p117
aVmake cutting-edge scientific research free to all \u2014
p118
aVeveryone in the world.
p119
aVAnd actually, a growing number of science publishers
p120
aVare adopting this model.
p121
aVLast year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers
p122
aVaround the world worked together
p123
aVto sequence the genome of the parasite responsible
p124
aVfor some of the developing world's worst diseases:
p125
aVAfrican sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
p126
aVThat genome data can now be found
p127
aVon open-access genetic data banks around the world,
p128
aVand it's an enormous boon to researchers
p129
aVtrying to come up with treatments.
p130
aVBut my favorite example has to be the global response
p131
aVto the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on
p132
aVworldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
p133
aVThe U.S. National Research Council
p134
aVin its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically
p135
aVcited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason
p136
aVwhy the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd we can see world-changing values
p139
aVin something as humble as a cell phone.
p140
aVI can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room
p141
aVwho do not use a mobile phone \u2014
p142
aVand where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVFor many of us, cell phones have really become
p145
aValmost an extension of ourselves,
p146
aVand we're really now beginning to see the social changes
p147
aVthat mobile phones can bring about.
p148
aVYou may already know some of the big-picture aspects:
p149
aVglobally, more camera phones were sold last year
p150
aVthan any other kind of camera,
p151
aVand a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,
p152
aVand over the network \u2014 and sometimes enter history books.
p153
aVIn the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.
p154
aVA study last year showed a direct correlation
p155
aVbetween the growth of mobile phone use
p156
aVand subsequent GDP increases across Africa.
p157
aVIn Kenya, mobile phone minutes
p158
aVhave actually become an alternative currency.
p159
aVThe political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,
p160
aVfrom text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,
p161
aVto the Blairwatch Project in the UK,
p162
aVkeeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd it's just going to get more wild.
p166
aVPervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,
p167
aVeven devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,
p168
aVwill transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.
p169
aVIt's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone
p170
aVmay be among the world's most important technologies.
p171
aVAnd in this rapidly evolving context,
p172
aVit's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes
p173
aVsomething far more than a medium for social interaction.
p174
aa(lp175
VI've long admired the Witness project,
p176
aVand Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,
p177
aVin his profoundly moving presentation.
p178
aVAnd I'm just incredibly happy to see the news
p179
aVthat Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal
p180
aVto enable users of digital cameras and camera phones
p181
aVto send in their recordings over the Internet,
p182
aVrather than just hand-carrying the videotape.
p183
aVNot only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue
p184
aVfor documenting abuses,
p185
aVit opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.
p188
aVImagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence
p189
aVof what's happening to the planet:
p190
aVputting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,
p191
aVfrom activists and researchers
p192
aVto businesspeople and political figures.
p193
aVIt would highlight the changes that are underway,
p194
aVbut would more importantly give voice
p195
aVto the people who are willing to work
p196
aVto see a new world, a better world, come about.
p197
aVIt would give everyday citizens
p198
aVa chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
p199
aVIt would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.
p200
aVNow, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"
p201
aVas part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,
p202
aVfor what this imaginary project could aspire to,
p203
aVnot to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.
p204
aVIt could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"
p205
aV"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" \u2014
p206
aVbut Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness
p209
aVwould focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,
p210
aVespecially environmental crimes
p211
aVand significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
p212
aVThat's understandable and important.
p213
aVWe need better documentation of what's happening to the planet
p214
aVif we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.
p215
aVBut the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.
p216
aVIn the best Worldchanging tradition,
p217
aVit might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects
p218
aVand efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
p219
aVEarth Witness would show us two worlds:
p220
aVthe world we're leaving behind,
p221
aVand the world we're building for generations to come.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is
p224
aVwe could do it today.
p225
aVThe key components are already widely available.
p226
aVCamera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.
p227
aVAnd for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet
p228
aVto always-on, widely available information tools.
p229
aVWe may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us
p230
aVwherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.
p231
aVYou could even imagine a version of this scenario
p232
aVin which people actually build their own phones.
p233
aVOver the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers
p234
aVhave come up with multiple models
p235
aVfor usable, Linux-based mobile phones,
p236
aVand the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
p237
aVAt the other end of the network, there'd be
p238
aVa server for people to send photos and messages to,
p239
aVaccessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,
p240
aVsocial networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
p241
aVNow, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,
p242
aVbut for those of you for whom that last sentence
p243
aVwas in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:
p244
aVthe online part of the Earth Witness project
p245
aVwould be created by the users, working together and working openly.
p246
aVThat's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle
p247
aVof what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
p248
aa(lp249
VAn Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot
p250
aVfor all sorts of data about conditions around the planet
p251
aVpicked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
p252
aVNow, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,
p253
aVbut students and engineers around the world
p254
aVhave attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers
p255
aVand cheap robots and the backs of pigeons \u2014
p256
aVthat being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,
p257
aVusing bird-mounted sensors
p258
aVas a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.
p259
aVIt's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing
p260
aVon a phone carried by a person.
p261
aVNow, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:
p262
aVphone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,
p263
aVor tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
p264
aVSwedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes
p265
aVa mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,
p266
aVuploading the data, displaying the results.
p267
aVEven the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,
p268
aVdesigning a prototype phone
p269
aVthat has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors
p272
aVon the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together
p273
aVa phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,
p274
aVthe presence of some biotoxins \u2014
p275
aVpotentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.
p276
aVYou could see that some kind of system like this
p277
aVwould actually be a really good fit
p278
aVwith Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.
p279
aVNow, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information
p280
aVand mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
p281
aVAnd that's worth noting in particular.
p282
aVThe impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two
p283
aVhas been simply phenomenal.
p284
aVDevelopers around the world have come up with
p285
aVan amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,
p286
aVfrom bus routes and crime statistics
p287
aVto the global progress of avian flu.
p288
aVEarth Witness would take this further, linking what you see
p289
aVwith what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
p290
aa(lp291
VIt's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished
p292
aVif something like this ever existed.
p293
aVWe'd have a far better \u2014 far better knowledge
p294
aVof what's happening on our planet environmentally
p295
aVthan could be gathered with satellites
p296
aVand a handful of government sensor nets alone.
p297
aVIt would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach
p298
aVto environmental awareness and protection,
p299
aVable to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way \u2014
p300
aVand if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.
p301
aVAnd most important,
p302
aVyou can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
p303
aVThis is a system that could put the next generation
p304
aVat the front lines of gathering environmental data.
p305
aVAnd as we work to figure out ways to mitigate
p306
aVthe worst effects of climate disruption,
p307
aVevery little bit of information matters.
p308
aVA system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us
p309
aVto participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,
p310
aVthe improvement of the planet itself.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, as I suggested at the outset,
p313
aVthere are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,
p314
aVso why have I spent the bulk of my time
p315
aVtelling you about something that doesn't exist?
p316
aVBecause this is what tomorrow could look like:
p317
aVbottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration
p318
aVto handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.
p319
aVWe can save the planet, but we can't do it alone \u2014 we need each other.
p320
aVNobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,
p321
aVmaking use of technological innovations and human communities alike,
p322
aVwe might just be able to fix it ourselves.
p323
aVWe have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,
p324
aVpowerful tools, and innovative ideas
p325
aVthat can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.
p326
aVWe don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;
p327
aVwe already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.
p328
aVThere's a staggering array of wonders out there,
p329
aVacross diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:
p330
aVsuccess can be ours if we're willing to try.
p331
aVAnd as we say at Worldchanging,
p332
aVanother world isn't just possible; another world is here.
p333
aVWe just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
