VI need to make a confession at the outset here.
p4
aVA little over 20 years ago, I did something that I regret,
p5
aVsomething that I'm not particularly proud of.
p6
aVSomething that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,
p7
aVbut here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VIn the late 1980s,
p12
aVin a moment of youthful indiscretion,
p13
aVI went to law school.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIn America, law is a professional degree:
p18
aVafter your university degree, you go on to law school.
p19
aVWhen I got to law school,
p20
aVI didn't do very well.
p21
aVTo put it mildly, I didn't do very well.
p22
aVI, in fact, graduated in the part of my law school class
p23
aVthat made the top 90% possible.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VThank you.
p28
aVI never practiced law a day in my life;
p29
aVI pretty much wasn't allowed to.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut today, against my better judgment,
p34
aVagainst the advice of my own wife,
p35
aVI want to try to dust off some of those legal skills \u2014
p36
aVwhat's left of those legal skills.
p37
aVI don't want to tell you a story.
p38
aVI want to make a case.
p39
aVI want to make a hard-headed,
p40
aVevidence-based,
p41
aVdare I say lawyerly case,
p42
aVfor rethinking how we run our businesses.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
p45
aVtake a look at this.
p46
aVThis is called the candle problem.
p47
aVSome of you might know it.
p48
aVIt's created in 1945
p49
aVby a psychologist named Karl Duncker.
p50
aVHe created this experiment
p51
aVthat is used in many other experiments in behavioral science.
p52
aVAnd here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter.
p53
aVI bring you into a room.
p54
aVI give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.
p55
aVAnd I say to you,
p56
aV"Your job is to attach the candle to the wall
p57
aVso the wax doesn't drip onto the table."
p58
aVNow what would you do?
p59
aa(lp60
VMany people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.
p61
aVDoesn't work.
p62
aVI saw somebody kind of make the motion over here \u2014
p63
aVsome people have a great idea where they light the match,
p64
aVmelt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.
p65
aVIt's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.
p66
aVAnd eventually, after five or ten minutes,
p67
aVmost people figure out the solution,
p68
aVwhich you can see here.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.
p71
aVYou look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.
p72
aVBut it can also have this other function,
p73
aVas a platform for the candle.
p74
aVThe candle problem.
p75
aa(lp76
VI want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem,
p77
aVdone by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,
p78
aVwho is now at Princeton University, US,
p79
aVThis shows the power of incentives.
p80
aa(lp81
VHe gathered his participants and said:
p82
aV"I'm going to time you, how quickly you can solve this problem."
p83
aVTo one group he said,
p84
aV"I'm going to time you to establish norms,
p85
aVaverages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem."
p86
aa(lp87
VTo the second group he offered rewards.
p88
aVHe said, "If you're in the top 25% of the fastest times,
p89
aVyou get five dollars.
p90
aVIf you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today,
p91
aVyou get 20 dollars."
p92
aVNow this is several years ago, adjusted for inflation,
p93
aVit's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.
p94
aVIt's a nice motivator.
p95
aa(lp96
VQuestion:
p97
aVHow much faster did this group solve the problem?
p98
aa(lp99
VAnswer:
p100
aVIt took them, on average, three and a half minutes longer.
p101
aV3.5 min longer.
p102
aVThis makes no sense, right?
p103
aVI mean, I'm an American. I believe in free markets.
p104
aVThat's not how it's supposed to work, right?
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VIf you want people to perform better, you reward them. Right?
p109
aVBonuses, commissions, their own reality show.
p110
aVIncentivize them.
p111
aVThat's how business works.
p112
aVBut that's not happening here.
p113
aVYou've got an incentive designed
p114
aVto sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,
p115
aVand it does just the opposite.
p116
aVIt dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat's interesting about this experiment
p119
aVis that it's not an aberration.
p120
aVThis has been replicated over and over again
p121
aVfor nearly 40 years.
p122
aVThese contingent motivators \u2014
p123
aVif you do this, then you get that \u2014
p124
aVwork in some circumstances.
p125
aVBut for a lot of tasks, they actually either don't work
p126
aVor, often, they do harm.
p127
aVThis is one of the most robust findings in social science,
p128
aVand also one of the most ignored.
p129
aa(lp130
VI spent the last couple of years
p131
aVlooking at the science of human motivation,
p132
aVparticularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators
p133
aVand intrinsic motivators.
p134
aVAnd I'm telling you, it's not even close.
p135
aVIf you look at the science, there is a mismatch
p136
aVbetween what science knows
p137
aVand what business does.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhat's alarming here is that our business operating system \u2014
p140
aVthink of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses,
p141
aVhow we motivate people, how we apply our human resources\u2014
p142
aVit's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators,
p143
aVaround carrots and sticks.
p144
aVThat's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.
p145
aVBut for 21st century tasks,
p146
aVthat mechanistic, reward-and-punishment approach
p147
aVdoesn't work,
p148
aVoften doesn't work,
p149
aVand often does harm.
p150
aVLet me show you.
p151
aa(lp152
VGlucksberg did another similar experiment,
p153
aVhe presented the problem in a slightly different way,
p154
aVlike this up here.
p155
aVAttach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.
p156
aVSame deal. You: we're timing for norms.
p157
aVYou: we're incentivizing.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhat happened this time?
p160
aVThis time, the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt.
p161
aVWhy?
p162
aVBecause when the tacks are out of the box,
p163
aVit's pretty easy isn't it?
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VIf-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks,
p168
aVwhere there is a simple set of rules
p169
aVand a clear destination to go to.
p170
aVRewards, by their very nature,
p171
aVnarrow our focus, concentrate the mind;
p172
aVthat's why they work in so many cases.
p173
aVSo, for tasks like this,
p174
aVa narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there,
p175
aVzoom straight ahead to it,
p176
aVthey work really well.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut for the real candle problem,
p179
aVyou don't want to be looking like this.
p180
aVThe solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around.
p181
aVThat reward actually narrows our focus
p182
aVand restricts our possibility.
p183
aa(lp184
VLet me tell you why this is so important.
p185
aVIn western Europe,
p186
aVin many parts of Asia,
p187
aVin North America, in Australia,
p188
aVwhite-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work,
p189
aVand more of this kind of work.
p190
aVThat routine, rule-based, left-brain work \u2014
p191
aVcertain kinds of accounting, financial analysis,
p192
aVcomputer programming \u2014
p193
aVhas become fairly easy to outsource,
p194
aVfairly easy to automate.
p195
aVSoftware can do it faster.
p196
aVLow-cost providers can do it cheaper.
p197
aVSo what really matters
p198
aVare the more right-brained creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.
p199
aa(lp200
VThink about your own work.
p201
aVThink about your own work.
p202
aVAre the problems that you face,
p203
aVor even the problems we've been talking about here,
p204
aVdo they have a clear set of rules,
p205
aVand a single solution?
p206
aVNo. The rules are mystifying.
p207
aVThe solution, if it exists at all,
p208
aVis surprising and not obvious.
p209
aVEverybody in this room
p210
aVis dealing with their own version of the candle problem.
p211
aVAnd for candle problems of any kind,
p212
aVin any field,
p213
aVthose if-then rewards,
p214
aVthe things around which we've built so many of our businesses,
p215
aVdon't work!
p216
aa(lp217
VIt makes me crazy.
p218
aVAnd here's the thing.
p219
aVThis is not a feeling.
p220
aVOkay? I'm a lawyer; I don't believe in feelings.
p221
aVThis is not a philosophy.
p222
aVI'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VThis is a fact \u2014
p227
aVor, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C.,
p228
aVa true fact.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VLet me give you an example.
p235
aVLet me marshal the evidence here.
p236
aVI'm not telling a story, I'm making a case.
p237
aVLadies and gentlemen of the jury, some evidence:
p238
aVDan Ariely, one of the great economists of our time,
p239
aVhe and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students.
p240
aVThey gave these MIT students a bunch of games,
p241
aVgames that involved creativity,
p242
aVand motor skills, and concentration.
p243
aVAnd the offered them, for performance,
p244
aVthree levels of rewards:
p245
aVsmall reward, medium reward, large reward.
p246
aVIf you do really well you get the large reward, on down.
p247
aa(lp248
VWhat happened?
p249
aVAs long as the task involved only mechanical skill
p250
aVbonuses worked as they would be expected:
p251
aVthe higher the pay, the better the performance.
p252
aVOkay?
p253
aVBut once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill,
p254
aVa larger reward led to poorer performance.
p255
aa(lp256
VThen they said,
p257
aV"Let's see if there's any cultural bias here.
p258
aVLet's go to Madurai, India and test it."
p259
aVStandard of living is lower.
p260
aVIn Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,
p261
aVis more meaningful there.
p262
aVSame deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat happens?
p265
aVPeople offered the medium level of rewards
p266
aVdid no better than people offered the small rewards.
p267
aVBut this time, people offered the highest rewards,
p268
aVthey did the worst of all.
p269
aVIn eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,
p270
aVhigher incentives led to worse performance.
p271
aa(lp272
VIs this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here?
p273
aVNo, these are economists from MIT,
p274
aVfrom Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.
p275
aVDo you know who sponsored this research?
p276
aVThe Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.
p277
aVThat's the American experience.
p278
aa(lp279
VLet's go across the pond to the London School of Economics,
p280
aVLSE, London School of Economics,
p281
aValma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics.
p282
aVTraining ground for great economic thinkers
p283
aVlike George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,
p284
aVand Mick Jagger.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VLast month,
p289
aVjust last month,
p290
aVeconomists at LSE looked at 51 studies
p291
aVof pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.
p292
aVHere's what they said:
p293
aV"We find that financial incentives
p294
aVcan result in a negative impact on overall performance."
p295
aa(lp296
VThere is a mismatch between what science knows
p297
aVand what business does.
p298
aVAnd what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble
p299
aVof the economic collapse,
p300
aVis that too many organizations are making their decisions,
p301
aVtheir policies about talent and people,
p302
aVbased on assumptions that are outdated,
p303
aVunexamined,
p304
aVand rooted more in folklore than in science.
p305
aVAnd if we really want to get out of this economic mess,
p306
aVif we really want high performance
p307
aVon those definitional tasks of the 21st century,
p308
aVthe solution is not to do more of the wrong things,
p309
aVto entice people with a sweeter carrot,
p310
aVor threaten them with a sharper stick.
p311
aVWe need a whole new approach.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe good news is that the scientists
p314
aVwho've been studying motivation have given us this new approach.
p315
aVIt's built much more around intrinsic motivation.
p316
aVAround the desire to do things because they matter,
p317
aVbecause we like it, they're interesting, or part of something important.
p318
aVAnd to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses
p319
aVrevolves around three elements:
p320
aVautonomy, mastery and purpose.
p321
aVAutonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.
p322
aVMastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.
p323
aVPurpose: the yearning to do what we do
p324
aVin the service of something larger than ourselves.
p325
aVThese are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system
p326
aVfor our businesses.
p327
aa(lp328
VI want to talk today only about autonomy.
p329
aVIn the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.
p330
aVManagement did not emanate from nature.
p331
aVManagement is not a tree, it's a television set.
p332
aVSomebody invented it.
p333
aVIt doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
p334
aVManagement is great.
p335
aVTraditional notions of management are great
p336
aVif you want compliance.
p337
aVBut if you want engagement, self-direction works better.
p338
aa(lp339
VSome examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction.
p340
aVYou don't see a lot of it,
p341
aVbut you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on,
p342
aVwhat it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely \u2014
p343
aVgetting the issue of money off the table,
p344
aVand then giving people lots of autonomy.
p345
aa(lp346
VSome examples.
p347
aVHow many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?
p348
aVIt looks like less than half.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VAtlassian is an Australian software company.
p353
aVAnd they do something incredibly cool.
p354
aVA few times a year they tell their engineers,
p355
aV"Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,
p356
aVas long as it's not part of your regular job.
p357
aVWork on anything you want."
p358
aVEngineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code,
p359
aVcome up with an elegant hack.
p360
aVThen they present all of the stuff that they've developed
p361
aVto their teammates, to the rest of the company,
p362
aVin this wild and woolly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.
p363
aVBeing Australians, everybody has a beer.
p364
aa(lp365
VThey call them FedEx Days.
p366
aVWhy?
p367
aVBecause you have to deliver something overnight.
p368
aVIt's pretty; not bad.
p369
aVIt's a huge trademark violation, but it's pretty clever.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VThat one day of intense autonomy
p374
aVhas produced a whole array of software fixes
p375
aVthat might never have existed.
p376
aa(lp377
VIt's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level
p378
aVwith 20% time \u2014
p379
aVdone, famously, at Google \u2014
p380
aVwhere engineers can spend 20% of their time
p381
aVworking on anything they want.
p382
aVThey have autonomy over their time,
p383
aVtheir task, their team, their technique.
p384
aVRadical amounts of autonomy.
p385
aVAnd at Google, as many of you know,
p386
aVabout half of the new products in a typical year
p387
aVare birthed during that 20% time:
p388
aVthings like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.
p389
aa(lp390
VLet me give you an even more radical example of it:
p391
aVsomething called the Results Only Work Environment (the ROWE),
p392
aVcreated by two American consultants,
p393
aVin place at a dozen companies around North America.
p394
aVIn a ROWE people don't have schedules.
p395
aVThey show up when they want.
p396
aVThey don't have to be in the office at a certain time, or any time.
p397
aVThey just have to get their work done.
p398
aVHow they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them.
p399
aVMeetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
p400
aa(lp401
VWhat happens?
p402
aVAlmost across the board,
p403
aVproductivity goes up, worker engagement goes up,
p404
aVworker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.
p405
aVAutonomy, mastery and purpose,
p406
aVthe building blocks of a new way of doing things.
p407
aa(lp408
VSome of you might look at this and say,
p409
aV"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."
p410
aVAnd I say, "Nope.
p411
aVI have proof."
p412
aVThe mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta.
p413
aVThey had deployed all the right incentives,
p414
aVThey paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.
p415
aVWell-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing
p416
aVto make sure it came in on budget and on time.
p417
aVA few years later, another encyclopedia got started.
p418
aVDifferent model, right?
p419
aVDo it for fun.
p420
aVNo one gets paid a cent, or a euro or a yen.
p421
aVDo it because you like to do it.
p422
aa(lp423
VJust 10 years ago,
p424
aVif you had gone to an economist, anywhere,
p425
aV"Hey, I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.
p426
aVIf they went head to head, who would win?"
p427
aV10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist
p428
aVanywhere on planet Earth
p429
aVwho would have predicted the Wikipedia model.
p430
aa(lp431
VThis is the titanic battle between these two approaches.
p432
aVThis is the Ali-Frazier of motivation, right?
p433
aVThis is the Thrilla in Manila.
p434
aVIntrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.
p435
aVAutonomy, mastery and purpose,
p436
aVversus carrot and sticks, and who wins?
p437
aVIntrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery and purpose, in a knockout.
p438
aa(lp439
VLet me wrap up.
p440
aVThere is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.
p441
aVHere is what science knows.
p442
aVOne: Those 20th century rewards,
p443
aVthose motivators we think are a natural part of business,
p444
aVdo work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.
p445
aVTwo: Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.
p446
aVThree: The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments,
p447
aVbut that unseen intrinsic drive\u2014
p448
aVthe drive to do things for their own sake.
p449
aVThe drive to do things cause they matter.
p450
aa(lp451
VAnd here's the best part.
p452
aVWe already know this.
p453
aVThe science confirms what we know in our hearts.
p454
aVSo, if we repair this mismatch between science and business,
p455
aVif we bring our motivation, notions of motivation
p456
aVinto the 21st century,
p457
aVif we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology
p458
aVof carrots and sticks,
p459
aVwe can strengthen our businesses,
p460
aVwe can solve a lot of those candle problems,
p461
aVand maybe, maybe \u2014
p462
aVwe can change the world.
p463
