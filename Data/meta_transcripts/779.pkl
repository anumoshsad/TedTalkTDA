VEverybody talks about happiness these days.
p4
aVI had somebody count the number of books
p5
aVwith "happiness" in the title published in the last five years
p6
aVand they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
p7
aVThere is a huge wave of interest in happiness,
p8
aVamong researchers.
p9
aVThere is a lot of happiness coaching.
p10
aVEverybody would like to make people happier.
p11
aVBut in spite of all this flood of work,
p12
aVthere are several cognitive traps
p13
aVthat sort of make it almost impossible to think straight
p14
aVabout happiness.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.
p17
aVThis applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,
p18
aVand it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,
p19
aVbecause it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.
p20
aVThe first of these traps
p21
aVis a reluctance to admit complexity.
p22
aVIt turns out that the word "happiness"
p23
aVis just not a useful word anymore,
p24
aVbecause we apply it to too many different things.
p25
aVI think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,
p26
aVbut by and large,
p27
aVthis is something that we'll have to give up
p28
aVand we'll have to adopt the more complicated view
p29
aVof what well-being is.
p30
aVThe second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;
p31
aVbasically, it's between being happy in your life,
p32
aVand being happy about your life
p33
aVor happy with your life.
p34
aVAnd those are two very different concepts,
p35
aVand they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.
p36
aVAnd the third is the focusing illusion,
p37
aVand it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance
p38
aVthat affects well-being
p39
aVwithout distorting its importance.
p40
aVI mean, this is a real cognitive trap.
p41
aVThere's just no way of getting it right.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, I'd like to start with an example
p44
aVof somebody who had a question-and-answer session
p45
aVafter one of my lectures reported a story,
p46
aVand that was a story \u2014
p47
aVHe said he'd been listening to a symphony,
p48
aVand it was absolutely glorious music
p49
aVand at the very end of the recording,
p50
aVthere was a dreadful screeching sound.
p51
aVAnd then he added, really quite emotionally,
p52
aVit ruined the whole experience.
p53
aVBut it hadn't.
p54
aVWhat it had ruined were the memories of the experience.
p55
aVHe had had the experience.
p56
aVHe had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
p57
aVThey counted for nothing
p58
aVbecause he was left with a memory;
p59
aVthe memory was ruined,
p60
aVand the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhat this is telling us, really,
p63
aVis that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people
p64
aVin terms of two selves.
p65
aVThere is an experiencing self,
p66
aVwho lives in the present
p67
aVand knows the present,
p68
aVis capable of re-living the past,
p69
aVbut basically it has only the present.
p70
aVIt's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches \u2014
p71
aVyou know, when the doctor asks,
p72
aV"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
p73
aVAnd then there is a remembering self,
p74
aVand the remembering self is the one that keeps score,
p75
aVand maintains the story of our life,
p76
aVand it's the one that the doctor approaches
p77
aVin asking the question,
p78
aV"How have you been feeling lately?"
p79
aVor "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.
p80
aVThose are two very different entities,
p81
aVthe experiencing self and the remembering self,
p82
aVand getting confused between them is part of the mess
p83
aVabout the notion of happiness.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, the remembering self
p86
aVis a storyteller.
p87
aVAnd that really starts with a basic response of our memories \u2014
p88
aVit starts immediately.
p89
aVWe don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.
p90
aVOur memory tells us stories,
p91
aVthat is, what we get to keep from our experiences
p92
aVis a story.
p93
aVAnd let me begin with one example.
p94
aVThis is an old study.
p95
aVThose are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.
p96
aVI won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,
p97
aVbut it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.
p98
aVThey were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
p99
aVHere are two patients,
p100
aVthose are their recordings.
p101
aVAnd you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"
p102
aVAnd it's a very easy question.
p103
aVClearly, Patient B suffered more \u2014
p104
aVhis colonoscopy was longer,
p105
aVand every minute of pain that Patient A had,
p106
aVPatient B had, and more.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut now there is another question:
p109
aV"How much did these patients think they suffered?"
p110
aVAnd here is a surprise.
p111
aVThe surprise is that Patient A
p112
aVhad a much worse memory of the colonoscopy
p113
aVthan Patient B.
p114
aVThe stories of the colonoscopies were different,
p115
aVand because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
p116
aVAnd neither of these stories is very inspiring or great \u2014
p117
aVbut one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)
p118
aVbut one of them is distinctly worse than the other.
p119
aVAnd the one that is worse
p120
aVis the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;
p121
aVit's a bad story.
p122
aVHow do we know that?
p123
aVBecause we asked these people after their colonoscopy,
p124
aVand much later, too,
p125
aV"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"
p126
aVAnd it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow this is a direct conflict
p129
aVbetween the experiencing self and the remembering self.
p130
aVFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,
p131
aVclearly, B had a worse time.
p132
aVNow, what you could do with Patient A,
p133
aVand we actually ran clinical experiments,
p134
aVand it has been done, and it does work \u2014
p135
aVyou could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A
p136
aVby just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.
p137
aVThat will cause the patient
p138
aVto suffer, but just a little
p139
aVand much less than before.
p140
aVAnd if you do that for a couple of minutes,
p141
aVyou have made the experiencing self
p142
aVof Patient A worse off,
p143
aVand you have the remembering self of Patient A
p144
aVa lot better off,
p145
aVbecause now you have endowed Patient A
p146
aVwith a better story
p147
aVabout his experience.
p148
aVWhat defines a story?
p149
aVAnd that is true of the stories
p150
aVthat memory delivers for us,
p151
aVand it's also true of the stories that we make up.
p152
aVWhat defines a story are changes,
p153
aVsignificant moments and endings.
p154
aVEndings are very, very important
p155
aVand, in this case, the ending dominated.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, the experiencing self
p158
aVlives its life continuously.
p159
aVIt has moments of experience, one after the other.
p160
aVAnd you can ask: What happens to these moments?
p161
aVAnd the answer is really straightforward:
p162
aVThey are lost forever.
p163
aVI mean, most of the moments of our life \u2014
p164
aVand I calculated, you know, the psychological present
p165
aVis said to be about three seconds long;
p166
aVthat means that, you know,
p167
aVin a life there are about 600 million of them;
p168
aVin a month, there are about 600,000 \u2014
p169
aVmost of them don't leave a trace.
p170
aVMost of them are completely ignored
p171
aVby the remembering self.
p172
aVAnd yet, somehow you get the sense
p173
aVthat they should count,
p174
aVthat what happens during these moments of experience
p175
aVis our life.
p176
aVIt's the finite resource that we're spending
p177
aVwhile we're on this earth.
p178
aVAnd how to spend it
p179
aVwould seem to be relevant,
p180
aVbut that is not the story
p181
aVthat the remembering self keeps for us.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo we have the remembering self
p184
aVand the experiencing self,
p185
aVand they're really quite distinct.
p186
aVThe biggest difference between them
p187
aVis in the handling of time.
p188
aVFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,
p189
aVif you have a vacation,
p190
aVand the second week is just as good as the first,
p191
aVthen the two-week vacation
p192
aVis twice as good as the one-week vacation.
p193
aVThat's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.
p194
aVFor the remembering self, a two-week vacation
p195
aVis barely better than the one-week vacation
p196
aVbecause there are no new memories added.
p197
aVYou have not changed the story.
p198
aVAnd in this way,
p199
aVtime is actually the critical variable
p200
aVthat distinguishes a remembering self
p201
aVfrom an experiencing self;
p202
aVtime has very little impact on the story.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, the remembering self does more
p205
aVthan remember and tell stories.
p206
aVIt is actually the one that makes decisions
p207
aVbecause, if you have a patient who has had, say,
p208
aVtwo colonoscopies with two different surgeons
p209
aVand is deciding which of them to choose,
p210
aVthen the one that chooses
p211
aVis the one that has the memory that is less bad,
p212
aVand that's the surgeon that will be chosen.
p213
aVThe experiencing self
p214
aVhas no voice in this choice.
p215
aVWe actually don't choose between experiences,
p216
aVwe choose between memories of experiences.
p217
aVAnd even when we think about the future,
p218
aVwe don't think of our future normally as experiences.
p219
aVWe think of our future
p220
aVas anticipated memories.
p221
aVAnd basically you can look at this,
p222
aVyou know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,
p223
aVand you can think of the remembering self
p224
aVsort of dragging the experiencing self
p225
aVthrough experiences that
p226
aVthe experiencing self doesn't need.
p227
aa(lp228
VI have that sense that
p229
aVwhen we go on vacations
p230
aVthis is very frequently the case;
p231
aVthat is, we go on vacations,
p232
aVto a very large extent,
p233
aVin the service of our remembering self.
p234
aVAnd this is a bit hard to justify I think.
p235
aVI mean, how much do we consume our memories?
p236
aVThat is one of the explanations
p237
aVthat is given for the dominance
p238
aVof the remembering self.
p239
aVAnd when I think about that, I think about a vacation
p240
aVwe had in Antarctica a few years ago,
p241
aVwhich was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,
p242
aVand I think of it relatively often,
p243
aVrelative to how much I think of other vacations.
p244
aVAnd I probably have consumed
p245
aVmy memories of that three-week trip, I would say,
p246
aVfor about 25 minutes in the last four years.
p247
aVNow, if I had ever opened the folder
p248
aVwith the 600 pictures in it,
p249
aVI would have spent another hour.
p250
aVNow, that is three weeks,
p251
aVand that is at most an hour and a half.
p252
aVThere seems to be a discrepancy.
p253
aVNow, I may be a bit extreme, you know,
p254
aVin how little appetite I have for consuming memories,
p255
aVbut even if you do more of this,
p256
aVthere is a genuine question:
p257
aVWhy do we put so much weight on memory
p258
aVrelative to the weight that we put on experiences?
p259
aa(lp260
VSo I want you to think
p261
aVabout a thought experiment.
p262
aVImagine that for your next vacation,
p263
aVyou know that at the end of the vacation
p264
aVall your pictures will be destroyed,
p265
aVand you'll get an amnesic drug
p266
aVso that you won't remember anything.
p267
aVNow, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)
p268
aVAnd if you would choose a different vacation,
p269
aVthere is a conflict between your two selves,
p270
aVand you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,
p271
aVand it's actually not at all obvious, because
p272
aVif you think in terms of time,
p273
aVthen you get one answer,
p274
aVand if you think in terms of memories,
p275
aVyou might get another answer.
p276
aVWhy do we pick the vacations we do
p277
aVis a problem that confronts us
p278
aVwith a choice between the two selves.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow, the two selves
p281
aVbring up two notions of happiness.
p282
aVThere are really two concepts of happiness
p283
aVthat we can apply, one per self.
p284
aVSo you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?
p285
aVAnd then you would ask: How happy are the moments
p286
aVin the experiencing self's life?
p287
aVAnd they're all \u2014 happiness for moments
p288
aVis a fairly complicated process.
p289
aVWhat are the emotions that can be measured?
p290
aVAnd, by the way, now we are capable
p291
aVof getting a pretty good idea
p292
aVof the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
p293
aVIf you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,
p294
aVit's a completely different thing.
p295
aVThis is not about how happily a person lives.
p296
aVIt is about how satisfied or pleased the person is
p297
aVwhen that person thinks about her life.
p298
aVVery different notion.
p299
aVAnyone who doesn't distinguish those notions
p300
aVis going to mess up the study of happiness,
p301
aVand I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,
p302
aVwho've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time
p303
aVin precisely this way.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe distinction between the
p306
aVhappiness of the experiencing self
p307
aVand the satisfaction of the remembering self
p308
aVhas been recognized in recent years,
p309
aVand there are now efforts to measure the two separately.
p310
aVThe Gallup Organization has a world poll
p311
aVwhere more than half a million people
p312
aVhave been asked questions
p313
aVabout what they think of their life
p314
aVand about their experiences,
p315
aVand there have been other efforts along those lines.
p316
aVSo in recent years, we have begun to learn
p317
aVabout the happiness of the two selves.
p318
aVAnd the main lesson I think that we have learned
p319
aVis they are really different.
p320
aVYou can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,
p321
aVand that really doesn't teach you much
p322
aVabout how happily they're living their life,
p323
aVand vice versa.
p324
aVJust to give you a sense of the correlation,
p325
aVthe correlation is about .5.
p326
aVWhat that means is if you met somebody,
p327
aVand you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"
p328
aVhow much would you know about his height?
p329
aVWell, you would know something about his height,
p330
aVbut there's a lot of uncertainty.
p331
aVYou have that much uncertainty.
p332
aVIf I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,
p333
aVyou have a lot of uncertainty
p334
aVabout how happy they are
p335
aVwith their experiencing self.
p336
aVSo the correlation is low.
p337
aa(lp338
VWe know something about what controls
p339
aVsatisfaction of the happiness self.
p340
aVWe know that money is very important,
p341
aVgoals are very important.
p342
aVWe know that happiness is mainly
p343
aVbeing satisfied with people that we like,
p344
aVspending time with people that we like.
p345
aVThere are other pleasures, but this is dominant.
p346
aVSo if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,
p347
aVyou are going to end up
p348
aVdoing very different things.
p349
aVThe bottom line of what I've said here
p350
aVis that we really should not think of happiness
p351
aVas a substitute for well-being.
p352
aVIt is a completely different notion.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow, very quickly,
p355
aVanother reason we cannot think straight about happiness
p356
aVis that we do not attend to the same things
p357
aVwhen we think about life, and we actually live.
p358
aVSo, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,
p359
aVyou are not going to get to the correct answer.
p360
aVWhen you ask that question,
p361
aVyou think people must be happier in California
p362
aVif, say, you live in Ohio.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVAnd what happens is
p365
aVwhen you think about living in California,
p366
aVyou are thinking of the contrast
p367
aVbetween California and other places,
p368
aVand that contrast, say, is in climate.
p369
aVWell, it turns out that climate
p370
aVis not very important to the experiencing self
p371
aVand it's not even very important to the reflective self
p372
aVthat decides how happy people are.
p373
aVBut now, because the reflective self is in charge,
p374
aVyou may end up \u2014 some people may end up
p375
aVmoving to California.
p376
aVAnd it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen
p377
aVto people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.
p378
aVWell, their experiencing self
p379
aVis not going to get happier.
p380
aVWe know that.
p381
aVBut one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,
p382
aVbecause, when they think about it,
p383
aVthey'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,
p384
aVand they will feel they made the right decision.
p385
aa(lp386
VIt is very difficult
p387
aVto think straight about well-being,
p388
aVand I hope I have given you a sense
p389
aVof how difficult it is.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VChris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.
p396
aVThank you so much.
p397
aVNow, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,
p398
aVyou mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result
p399
aVcame out of that Gallup survey.
p400
aVIs that something you can share
p401
aVsince you do have a few moments left now?
p402
aa(lp403
VDaniel Kahneman: Sure.
p404
aVI think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey
p405
aVis a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.
p406
aVWe found that with respect to the happiness
p407
aVof the experiencing self.
p408
aVWhen we looked at how feelings,
p409
aVvary with income.
p410
aVAnd it turns out that, below an income
p411
aVof 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans \u2014
p412
aVand that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,
p413
aVso it's a large representative sample \u2014
p414
aVbelow an income of 600,000 dollars a year...
p415
aa(lp416
VCA: 60,000.
p417
aa(lp418
VDK: 60,000.
p419
aV(Laughter)
p420
aV60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,
p421
aVand they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.
p422
aVAbove that, we get an absolutely flat line.
p423
aVI mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.
p424
aVClearly, what is happening is
p425
aVmoney does not buy you experiential happiness,
p426
aVbut lack of money certainly buys you misery,
p427
aVand we can measure that misery
p428
aVvery, very clearly.
p429
aVIn terms of the other self, the remembering self,
p430
aVyou get a different story.
p431
aVThe more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
p432
aVThat does not hold for emotions.
p433
aa(lp434
VCA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about
p435
aVlife, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
p436
aVIf people took seriously that finding,
p437
aVI mean, it seems to turn upside down
p438
aVeverything we believe about, like for example,
p439
aVtaxation policy and so forth.
p440
aVIs there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,
p441
aVwould take a finding like that seriously
p442
aVand run public policy based on it?
p443
aa(lp444
VDK: You know I think that there is recognition
p445
aVof the role of happiness research in public policy.
p446
aVThe recognition is going to be slow in the United States,
p447
aVno question about that,
p448
aVbut in the U.K., it is happening,
p449
aVand in other countries it is happening.
p450
aVPeople are recognizing that they ought
p451
aVto be thinking of happiness
p452
aVwhen they think of public policy.
p453
aVIt's going to take a while,
p454
aVand people are going to debate
p455
aVwhether they want to study experience happiness,
p456
aVor whether they want to study life evaluation,
p457
aVso we need to have that debate fairly soon.
p458
aVHow to enhance happiness
p459
aVgoes very different ways depending on how you think,
p460
aVand whether you think of the remembering self
p461
aVor you think of the experiencing self.
p462
aVThis is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.
p463
aVIn the United States, efforts are being made
p464
aVto measure the experience happiness of the population.
p465
aVThis is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,
p466
aVpart of national statistics.
