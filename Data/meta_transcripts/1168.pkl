VA couple of years ago,
p4
aVwhen I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach,
p5
aVI met Harriet.
p6
aVWe'd actually met online before \u2014 not the way you're thinking.
p7
aVWe were introduced because we both knew Linda Avey,
p8
aVone of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies.
p9
aVAnd because we shared our genetic information with Linda,
p10
aVshe could see that Harriet and I shared
p11
aVa very rare type of mitochondrial DNA, haplotype K1a1b1a,
p12
aVwhich meant we were distantly related.
p13
aVWe actually share the same genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.
p14
aVSo \u2014 Ötzi, Harriet and me.
p15
aVAnd being the current day, of course, we started our own Facebook group.
p16
aVYou're all welcome to join.
p17
aVWhen I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED conference,
p18
aVshe'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype T-shirts.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VWhy am I telling you this story?
p23
aVWhat does it have to do with the future of health?
p24
aVWell, the way I met Harriet is an example
p25
aVof how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially growing technologies
p26
aVis affecting our future of health and wellness \u2014
p27
aVfrom low-cost gene analysis
p28
aVto the ability to do powerful bioinformatics
p29
aVto the connection of the Internet and social networking.
p30
aVWhat I'd like to talk about today
p31
aVis understanding these exponential technologies.
p32
aVWe often think linearly.
p33
aVBut if you think about it, if you have a lily pad
p34
aVand it just divided every single day \u2014
p35
aVtwo, four, eight, sixteen \u2014 in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.
p36
aVWhat do you think you'd have in a month?
p37
aVWe're at a billion.
p38
aVIf we start to think exponentially,
p39
aVwe can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us.
p40
aa(lp41
VMany of these technologies, speaking as a physician and innovator,
p42
aVwe can start to leverage, to impact the future of our own health
p43
aVand of health care,
p44
aVand to address many of the major challenges in health care today,
p45
aVranging from the exponential costs to the aging population,
p46
aVthe way we really don't use information very well today,
p47
aVthe fragmentation of care
p48
aVand the often very difficult course of adoption of innovation.
p49
aVAnd one of the major things we can do is move the curve to the left.
p50
aVWe spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life.
p51
aVWhat if we could incentivize physicians in the health care system
p52
aVand our own selves
p53
aVto move the curve to the left and improve our health,
p54
aVleveraging technology as well?
p55
aVNow my favorite example of exponential technology,
p56
aVwe all have in our pocket.
p57
aVIf you think about it, these are really dramatically improving.
p58
aVI mean, this is the iPhone 4.
p59
aVImagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, I've gained some insight into this.
p62
aVI've been the track share for the medicine portion
p63
aVof a new institution called Singularity University,
p64
aVbased in Silicon Valley.
p65
aVWe bring together each summer about 100 very talented students
p66
aVfrom around the world.
p67
aVAnd we look at these exponential technologies from medicine,
p68
aVbiotech, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, space,
p69
aVand address how we can cross-train and leverage these
p70
aVto impact major unmet goals.
p71
aVWe also have seven-day executive programs.
p72
aVAnd coming up next month is FutureMed,
p73
aVa program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, I mentioned the phone.
p76
aVThese mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available.
p77
aVThere's one out of the UK where you can pee on a little chip,
p78
aVconnect it to your iPhone,
p79
aVand check for an STD.
p80
aVI don't know if I'd try that, but it's available.
p81
aVThere are other sorts of applications.
p82
aVMerging your phone and diagnostics, for example,
p83
aVmeasuring your blood glucose on your iPhone
p84
aVand sending that to your physician,
p85
aVso they can better understand and you can better understand
p86
aVyour blood sugars as a diabetic.
p87
aVSo let's see how exponential technologies are taking health care.
p88
aVLet's start with faster.
p89
aVIt's no secret that computers, through Moore's law,
p90
aVare speeding up faster and faster.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe can do more powerful things with them.
p93
aVThey're really approaching \u2014 in many cases, surpassing \u2014
p94
aVthe ability of the human mind.
p95
aVBut where I think computational speed is most applicable is in imaging.
p96
aVThe ability now to look inside the body in real time
p97
aVwith very high resolution
p98
aVis really becoming incredible.
p99
aVAnd we're layering multiple technologies \u2014 PET scans, CT scans
p100
aVand molecular diagnostics \u2014
p101
aVto find and seek things at different levels.
p102
aVHere you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today,
p103
aVof Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.
p104
aVAnd now we can see inside of the brain
p105
aVat a resolution and ability never before available,
p106
aVand essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even reengineer
p107
aVor backwards engineer the brain,
p108
aVso we can better understand pathology, disease and therapy.
p109
aVWe can look inside with real-time fMRI in the brain at real time.
p110
aVAnd by understanding these sorts of processes and these connections,
p111
aVwe're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation
p112
aVand better personalize and make effective, for example,
p113
aVpsychoactive drugs.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe scanners for these are getting smaller, less expensive
p116
aVand more portable.
p117
aVAnd this sort of data explosion available from these
p118
aVis really almost becoming a challenge.
p119
aVThe scan of today takes up about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.
p120
aVThe scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.
p121
aVHow do you leverage that information?
p122
aVLet's get personal.
p123
aVI won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy, but if you're over age 50,
p124
aVit's time for your screening colonoscopy.
p125
aVHow'd you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick?
p126
aVNow there's essentially virtual colonoscopy.
p127
aVCompare those two pictures.
p128
aVAs a radiologist, you can basically fly through your patient's colon,
p129
aVand augmenting that with artificial intelligence,
p130
aVpotentially identify a lesion that we might have missed,
p131
aVbut using AI on top of radiology,
p132
aVwe can find lesions that were missed before.
p133
aVMaybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies
p134
aVthat wouldn't have otherwise.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis is an example of this paradigm shift.
p137
aVWe're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology,
p138
aVwireless and, I would say, mobile now \u2014 this era of digital medicine.
p139
aVEven my stethoscope is now digital, and of course, there's an app for that.
p140
aVWe're moving, obviously, to the era of the tricorder.
p141
aVSo the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing
p142
aVand supplanting the stethoscope.
p143
aVThese are now at a price point of what used to be 100,000 euros
p144
aVor a couple hundred-thousand dollars.
p145
aVFor about 5,000 dollars,
p146
aVI can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand.
p147
aVMerging this now with the advent of electronic medical records \u2014
p148
aVin the US, we're still less than 20 percent electronic;
p149
aVhere in the Netherlands, I think it's more than 80 percent.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow that we're switching to merging medical data,
p152
aVmaking it available electronically,
p153
aVwe can crowd-source the information, and as a physician,
p154
aVI can access my patients' data from wherever I am,
p155
aVjust through my mobile device.
p156
aVAnd now, of course, we're in the era of the iPad, even the iPad 2.
p157
aVJust last month,
p158
aVthe first FDA-approved application was approved
p159
aVto allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices.
p160
aVSo certainly, the physicians of today, including myself,
p161
aVare completely reliable on these devices.
p162
aVAnd as you saw just about a month ago,
p163
aVWatson from IBM beat the two champions in "Jeopardy."
p164
aVSo I want you to imagine when, in a couple of years,
p165
aVwe've started to apply this cloud-based information,
p166
aVwhen we really have the AI physician and leverage our brains to connectivity
p167
aVto make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done.
p168
aVAlready today, you don't need to go to your physician in many cases.
p169
aVOnly in about 20 percent of visits do you need to lay hands on the patient.
p170
aVWe're now in the era of virtual visits.
p171
aVFrom Skype-type visits you can do with American Well,
p172
aVto Cisco, that's developed a very complex health presence system,
p173
aa(lp174
Vthe ability to interact with your health care provider is different.
p175
aVAnd these are being augmented even by our devices, again, today.
p176
aVMy friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration,
p177
aVso I can save her a trip to the emergency room,
p178
aVand do diagnostics that way.
p179
aVOr maybe we can leverage today's gaming technology,
p180
aVlike the Microsoft Kinect,
p181
aVhack that to enable diagnostics, for example, in diagnosing stroke,
p182
aVusing simple motion detection, using $100 devices.
p183
aVWe can actually now visit our patients robotically.
p184
aVThis is the RP7;
p185
aVif I'm a hematologist, I can visit another clinic or hospital.
p186
aVThese are being augmented by a whole suite of tools
p187
aVactually in the home now.
p188
aVWe already have wireless scales.
p189
aVYou step on the scale, tweet your weight to your friends,
p190
aVthey can keep you in line.
p191
aa(lp192
VWe have wireless blood pressure cuffs.
p193
aVA whole gamut of technologies are being put together.
p194
aVInstead of wearing kludgy devices, we put on a simple patch.
p195
aVThis was developed at Stanford.
p196
aVIt's called iRhythm; it completely supplants the prior technology
p197
aVat a much lower price point, with much more effectivity.
p198
aVWe're also in the era today of quantified self.
p199
aVConsumers now can basically buy $100 devices, like this little Fitbit.
p200
aVI can measure my steps, my caloric outtake.
p201
aVI can get insight into that on a daily basis
p202
aVand share it with my friends or physician.
p203
aVThere's watches that measure your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,
p204
aVa suite of tools that enable you to leverage
p205
aVand have insight into your own health.
p206
aa(lp207
VAs we start to integrate this information,
p208
aVwe'll know better what to do with it, and have better insight
p209
aVinto our own pathologies, health and wellness.
p210
aVThere's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate.
p211
aVAnd I would argue, in the future,
p212
aVwe'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.
p213
aVAnd just like the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on.
p214
aVIt won't say "check engine"; it'll be a "check your body" light,
p215
aVand you'll go get it taken care of.
p216
aVProbably in a few years,
p217
aVyou'll look in your mirror and it'll be diagnosing you.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VFor those of you with kiddos at home,
p222
aVhow would you like a wireless diaper that supports your \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VMore information, I think, than you might need,
p227
aVbut it's going to be here.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow, we've heard a lot today about technology and connection.
p230
aVAnd I think some of these technologies
p231
aVwill enable us to be more connected with our patients, to take more time
p232
aVand do the important human-touch elements of medicine,
p233
aVas augmented by these technologies.
p234
aVNow, we've talked about augmenting the patient.
p235
aVHow about augmenting the physician?
p236
aVWe're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon,
p237
aVwho can now go into the body and do robotic surgery, which is here today,
p238
aVat a level that was not really possible even five years ago.
p239
aVAnd now this is being augmented with further layers of technology,
p240
aVlike augmented reality.
p241
aVSo the surgeon can see inside the patient, through their lens,
p242
aVwhere the tumor is, where the blood vessels are.
p243
aVThis can be integrated with decision support.
p244
aVA surgeon in New York can help a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.
p245
aVAnd we're entering an era of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,
p246
aVwhere the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach
p247
aVand pull out that gallbladder,
p248
aVall in a scarless way and robotically.
p249
aVThis is called NOTES, and it's coming \u2014 basically scarless surgery,
p250
aVas mediated by robotic surgery.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow, how about controlling other elements?
p253
aVFor those who have disabilities \u2014 the paraplegic,
p254
aVthere's the brain-computer interface, or BCI,
p255
aVwhere chips have been put on the motor cortex
p256
aVof completely quadriplegic patients,
p257
aVand they can control a cursor or a wheelchair
p258
aVor, potentially, a robotic arm.
p259
aVThese devices are getting smaller
p260
aVand going into more and more of these patients.
p261
aVStill in clinical trials,
p262
aVbut imagine when we can connect these, for example,
p263
aVto the amazing bionic limb,
p264
aVsuch as the DEKA Arm, built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,
p265
aVwhich has 17 degrees of motion and freedom,
p266
aVand can allow the person who's lost a limb
p267
aVto have much higher dexterity or control than they've had in the past.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo we're really entering the era of wearable robotics, actually.
p270
aVIf you haven't lost a limb but had a stroke,
p271
aVyou can wear these augmented limbs.
p272
aVOr if you're a paraplegic \u2014 I've visited the folks at Berkeley Bionics \u2014
p273
aVthey've developed eLEGS.
p274
aVI took this video last week.
p275
aVHere's a paraplegic patient, walking by strapping on these exoskeletons.
p276
aVHe's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound.
p277
aVThis is the early era of wearable robotics.
p278
aVAnd by leveraging these sorts of technologies,
p279
aVwe're going to change the definition of disability
p280
aVto, in some cases, be superability, or super-enabling.
p281
aVThis is Aimee Mullins, who lost her lower limbs as a young child,
p282
aVand Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,
p283
aVwho lost his limbs in a climbing accident.
p284
aVAnd now both of them can climb better, move faster, swim differently
p285
aVwith their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons.
p286
aa(lp287
VHow about other exponentials?
p288
aVClearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction,
p289
aVincluding with huge costs.
p290
aVBut the trend in medicine is to get exponentially smaller.
p291
aVA few examples: we're now in the era of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.
p292
aVYou can swallow this completely integrated device.
p293
aVIt can take pictures of your GI system,
p294
aVhelp diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract.
p295
aVWe get into even smaller micro-robots
p296
aVthat will eventually, autonomously, move through your system,
p297
aVand be able to do things surgeons can't do
p298
aVin a much less invasive manner.
p299
aVSometimes these might self-assemble in your GI system,
p300
aVand be augmented in that reality.
p301
aa(lp302
VOn the cardiac side, pacemakers are getting smaller
p303
aVand much easier to place,
p304
aVso no need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them.
p305
aVAnd they'll be wirelessly telemetered to your mobile devices,
p306
aVso you can go places and be monitored remotely.
p307
aVThese are shrinking even further.
p308
aVThis one is in prototyping by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.
p309
aVArtificial retinas, the ability to put arrays on the back of the eyeball
p310
aVand allow the blind to see \u2014
p311
aValso in early trials, but moving into the future.
p312
aVThese are going to be game-changing.
p313
aVOr for those of us who are sighted,
p314
aVhow about having the assisted-living contact lens?
p315
aVBluetooth, Wi-Fi available \u2014 beams back images to your eye.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VNow, if you have trouble maintaining your diet,
p320
aVit might help to have some extra imagery
p321
aVto remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you.
p322
aa(lp323
VHow about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone
p324
aVto see at a microscopic level
p325
aVand to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics?
p326
aVIn fact, the whole era of laboratory medicine
p327
aVis completely changing.
p328
aVWe can now leverage microfluidics,
p329
aVlike this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford.
p330
aVMicrofluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians;
p331
aVput it on a chip, enable thousands of tests at the point of care,
p332
aVanywhere in the world.
p333
aVThis will really leverage technology to the rural and the underserved
p334
aVand enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done for pennies,
p335
aVand at the point of care.
p336
aVIf we go down the small pathway a little bit further,
p337
aVwe're entering the era of nanomedicine,
p338
aVthe ability to make devices super-small,
p339
aVto the point where we can design red blood cells
p340
aVor microrobots that monitor our blood system or immune system,
p341
aVor even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow how about exponentially cheaper?
p344
aVNot something we usually think about in the era of medicine,
p345
aVbut hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes \u2014 exponentially cheaper.
p346
aVIn genomics now, the genome cost about a billion dollars
p347
aVabout 10 years ago, when the first one came out.
p348
aVWe're now approaching essentially a $1,000 genome, probably next year.
p349
aVAnd in two years, a $100 genome.
p350
aVWhat will we do with $100 genomes?
p351
aVSoon we'll have millions of these tests available.
p352
aVThen it gets interesting, when we start to crowd-source that information,
p353
aVand enter the era of true personalized medicine:
p354
aVthe right drug for the right person at the right time,
p355
aVinstead of what we're doing now, which is the same drug for everybody,
p356
aVblockbuster drug medications, which don't work for the individual.
p357
aVMany different companies are working on leveraging these approaches.
p358
aa(lp359
VI'll show you a simple example, from 23andMe again.
p360
aVMy data indicates I've got about average risk
p361
aVfor developing macular degeneration, a kind of blindness.
p362
aVBut if I take that same data, upload it to deCODEme,
p363
aVI can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes; I'm at almost twice the risk.
p364
aVI might want to watch how much dessert I have at lunch, for example.
p365
aVIt might change my behavior.
p366
aVLeveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics:
p367
aVhow my genes modulate, what my drugs do and what doses I need
p368
aVwill become increasingly important,
p369
aVand once in the hands of individuals and patients,
p370
aVwill make better drug dosing and selection available.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo again, it's not just genes, it's multiple details \u2014
p373
aVour habits, our environmental exposures.
p374
aVWhen was the last time your doctor asked where you've lived?
p375
aVGeomedicine: where you live, what you've been exposed to,
p376
aVcan dramatically affect your health.
p377
aVWe can capture that information.
p378
aVGenomics, proteomics, the environment \u2014
p379
aVall this data streaming at us individually and as physicians:
p380
aVHow do we manage it?
p381
aVWe're now entering the era of systems medicine, systems biology,
p382
aVwhere we can start to integrate all this information.
p383
aVAnd by looking at the patterns, for example, in our blood,
p384
aVof 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,
p385
aVwe can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage.
p386
aVThis is called by Lee Hood, the father of the field, P4 Medicine.
p387
aVWe'll be predictive and know what you're likely to have.
p388
aVWe can be preventative; that prevention can be personalized.
p389
aVMore importantly, it'll be increasingly participatory.
p390
aVThrough websites like PatientsLikeMe
p391
aVor managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health,
p392
aVleveraging this together in participatory ways
p393
aVwill be increasingly important.
p394
aa(lp395
VI'll finish up with exponentially better.
p396
aVWe'd like to get therapies better and more effective.
p397
aVToday we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills.
p398
aVWhat if we take a new device,
p399
aVknock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure,
p400
aVand in a single therapy, basically cure hypertension?
p401
aVThis is a new device doing essentially that.
p402
aVIt should be on the market in a year or two.
p403
aVHow about more targeted therapies for cancer?
p404
aVI'm an oncologist and know that most of what we give is essentially poison.
p405
aVWe learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells,
p406
aVthe ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse.
p407
aVSo if you think of cancer as a weed,
p408
aVwe often can whack the weed away and it seems to shrink,
p409
aVbut it often comes back.
p410
aVSo we're attacking the wrong target.
p411
aVThe cancer stem cells remain,
p412
aVand the tumor can return months or years later.
p413
aVWe're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells
p414
aVand identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure.
p415
aVWe're entering the era of personalized oncology,
p416
aVthe ability to leverage all of this data together,

VI'll close with regenerative medicine.
p421
aVI've studied a lot about stem cells.
p422
aVEmbryonic stem cells are particularly powerful.
p423
aVWe have adult stem cells throughout our body;
p424
aVwe use those in bone marrow transplantation.
p425
aVGeron, last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells
p426
aVto treat spinal cord injuries.
p427
aVStill a phase I trial, but evolving.
p428
aVWe've been using adult stem cells in clinical trials for about 15 years
p429
aVto approach a whole range of topics, particularly cardiovascular disease.
p430
aVIf we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack,
p431
aVwe can see much improved heart function and better survival
p432
aVusing our own bone marrow derived cells after a heart attack.
p433
aa(lp434
VI invented a device called the MarrowMiner,
p435
aVa much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow.
p436
aVIt's now been FDA approved; hopefully on the market in the next year.
p437
aVHopefully you can appreciate the device
p438
aVgoing through the patient's body removing bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,
p439
aVbut with a single puncture, under local anesthesia.
p440
aa(lp441
VWhere is stem-cell therapy going?
p442
aVIf you think about it,
p443
aVevery cell in your body has the same DNA you had when you were an embryo.
p444
aVWe can now reprogram your skin cells
p445
aVto actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell
p446
aVand utilize those, potentially, to treat multiple organs in the same patient,
p447
aVmaking personalized stem cell lines.
p448
aVI think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking
p449
aVto have in the freezer your own cardiac cells, myocytes and neural cells
p450
aVto use them in the future, should you need them.
p451
aVWe're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering,
p452
aVand integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing,
p453
aVreplacing the ink with cells,
p454
aVand essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ.
p455
aa(lp456
VThat's where things are heading.
p457
aVStill very early days,
p458
aVbut I think, as integration of exponential technologies,
p459
aVthis is the example.
p460
aVSo in closing, as you think about technology trends
p461
aVand how to impact health and medicine,
p462
aVwe're entering an era of miniaturization,
p463
aVdecentralization and personalization.
p464
aVAnd by pulling these things together,
p465
aVif we start to think about how to understand and leverage them,
p466
aVwe're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness
p467
aVand begin to cure the well before they get sick.
p468
aVBecause I know as a doctor, if someone comes to me with stage I disease,
p469
aVI'm thrilled; we can often cure them.
p470
aVBut often it's too late,
p471
aVand it's stage III or IV cancer, for example.
p472
aVSo by leveraging these technologies together,
p473
aVI think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage 0 medicine.
p474
aVAnd as a cancer doctor, I'm looking forward to being out of a job.
