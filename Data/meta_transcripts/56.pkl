(lp3
VWalk around for four months with three wishes,
p4
aVand all the ideas will start to percolate up.
p5
aVI think everybody should do it \u2014 think that you've got three wishes.
p6
aVAnd what would you do? It's actually a great exercise
p7
aVto really drill down to the things that you feel are important,
p8
aVand really reflect on the world around us.
p9
aVAnd thinking that, can an individual actually do something,
p10
aVor come up with something,
p11
aVthat may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
p12
aVInspired by nature \u2014 that's the theme here.
p13
aVAnd I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
p14
aa(lp15
VI became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.
p16
aVWe have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,
p17
aVand my father was an avid outdoorsman.
p18
aVSo I really had a chance to experience that.
p19
aVAnd I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
p20
aVBut what I think it was telling me
p21
aVis that we are this transient thing that's happening,
p22
aVand that the nature that you see out there \u2014 the untouched shorelines,
p23
aVthe untouched forest that I was able to see \u2014
p24
aVreally bring in a sense of that geological time,
p25
aVthat this has gone on for a long time,
p26
aVand we're experiencing it in a different way.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have
p29
aVto be able to make the work that I did.
p30
aVAnd I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,
p31
aValong a roadside.
p32
aVThis rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years
p33
aVtrying to photograph the pristine landscape.
p34
aVBut as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt
p35
aVthat it wouldn't catch on out there,
p36
aVthat there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
p37
aVAnd I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,
p38
aVor something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
p39
aVSo I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
p40
aVI decided to rethink the landscape
p41
aVas the landscape that we've transformed.
p42
aa(lp43
VI had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,
p44
aVand I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
p45
aVAnd I ended up in a town called Frackville.
p46
aVI got out of the car, and I stood up,
p47
aVand it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,
p48
aVand that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
p49
aVTotally transformed by man.
p50
aVAnd that got me to go out and look at mines like this,
p51
aVand go out and look at the largest industrial incursions
p52
aVin the landscape that I could find.
p53
aVAnd that became the baseline of what I was doing.
p54
aVAnd it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,
p55
aVand not have to re-invent myself \u2014
p56
aVthat this theme was large enough to become a life's work,
p57
aVto become something that I could sink my teeth into
p58
aVand just research and find out where these industries are.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,
p61
aVwhich I kind of missed,
p62
aVwas to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
p63
aVBecause it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs \u2014
p64
aVto get into that place to make those photographs,
p65
aVand if it wasn't for those people letting me in
p66
aVat the heads of those corporations,
p67
aVI would have never made this body of work.
p68
aVSo in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
p69
aVI own a corporation. I work with them,
p70
aVand I feel that we all need them and they're important.
p71
aVBut I am also for sustainability.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
p74
aVAnd I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,
p75
aVbut it is a slow progression.
p76
aVSo I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:
p77
aVthe Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
p78
aVAnd these ages of man are still at work today.
p79
aVBut we've become totally disconnected from them.
p80
aVThere's something that we're not seeing there.
p81
aVAnd it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking
p82
aVat the collective appetite for our lifestyles,
p83
aVand what we're doing to that landscape \u2014
p84
aVthat, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd through my photographs,
p87
aVI'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,
p88
aVand to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
p89
aVNot to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it \u2014
p90
aVto say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,
p91
aVbut on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
p92
aVLike a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure
p93
aVthat I think is what resonates out there,
p94
aVand it gets people to look at these things,
p95
aVand it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too \u2014
p96
aVthat I'm drawn to have a good life.
p97
aVI want a house, and I want a car.
p98
aVBut there's this consequence out there.
p99
aVAnd how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
p100
aVIt's even in my own conscience I'm having it,
p101
aVand here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
p102
aa(lp103
VThese things that I photographed \u2014 this tire pile here
p104
aVhad 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
p105
aVIt was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire
p106
aVabout four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
p107
aVAnd I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had \u2014
p108
aVif the earlier work of looking at the landscape
p109
aVhad a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,
p110
aVin the recycling work that you're seeing here
p111
aVwas starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
p112
aVThat in the recycling work that I was doing,
p113
aVI'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
p114
aVThat if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,
p115
aVback into the system \u2014
p116
aVif we keep doing that \u2014 we can continue on.
p117
aVOf course, listening at the conference,
p118
aVthere's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,
p119
aVand there's many other things that are coming on stream \u2014
p120
aVnanotechnology that may also prevent us from having
p121
aVto go into that landscape and tear it apart.
p122
aVAnd we all look forward to those things.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut in the meantime, these things are scaling up.
p125
aVThese things are continuing to happen.
p126
aVWhat you're looking at here \u2014 I went to Bangladesh,
p127
aVso I started to move away from North America;
p128
aVI started to look at our world globally.
p129
aVThese images of Bangladesh
p130
aVcame out of a radio program I was listening to.
p131
aVThey were talking about Exxon Valdez,
p132
aVand that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers
p133
aVbecause of the insurance industries.
p134
aVAnd that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,
p135
aVand 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
p136
aVAnd I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
p137
aVTo see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,
p138
aVliterally, in third-world countries.
p139
aVSo originally I was going to go to India.
p140
aVAnd I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,
p141
aVand then I was able to get into Bangladesh,
p142
aVand saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,
p143
aVthat I had never actually thought was possible.
p144
aV130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin \u2014
p145
aVpeople everywhere \u2014 the pollution was intense,
p146
aVand the working conditions were horrible.
p147
aa(lp148
VHere you're looking at some oil fields in California,
p149
aVsome of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that \u2014
p150
aVthere was another epiphany \u2014
p151
aVthat the whole world I was living in was
p152
aVa result of having plentiful oil.
p153
aVAnd that, to me, was again something that I started building on,
p154
aVand I continued to build on.
p155
aVSo this is a series I'm hoping to have ready
p156
aVin about two or three years,
p157
aVunder the heading of "The Oil Party."
p158
aVBecause I think everything that we're involved in \u2014
p159
aVour clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything \u2014 are directly a result.
p160
aVI'm going to move to some pictures of China.
p161
aVAnd for me China \u2014 I started photographing it four years ago,
p162
aVand China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,
p163
aa(lp164
Vnot to mention that China, as well,
p165
aVhas a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
p166
aVI came out of a blue-collar town,
p167
aVa GM town, and my father worked at GM,
p168
aVso I was very familiar with that kind of industry
p169
aVand that also informed my work. But you know,
p170
aVto see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
p171
aVSo what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,
p172
aVand this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
p173
aVMost of the engineers around the world left the project
p174
aVbecause they said, "It's just too big."
p175
aVIn fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,
p176
aVthey were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
p177
aVIt took fifteen days to fill it.
p178
aVSo this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,
p179
aVone of the largest reservoirs ever created.
p180
aVAnd what was also one of the bigger projects around that
p181
aVwas moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,
p182
aVand flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is a "before and after." So that was before.
p185
aVAnd this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
p186
aVI think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,
p187
aVeverything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
p188
aVAnd this gives you an idea.
p189
aVAnd it was all the people who lived in those homes,
p190
aVwere the ones that were actually taking it apart
p191
aVand working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
p192
aVAnd these are some of the images from that.
p193
aVSo I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,
p194
aVlooking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
p195
aVAnd it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
p196
aVWhat it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
p197
aVThis is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this
p198
aVmassive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China
p201
aVbecause I think on the table right now,
p202
aVthere's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
p203
aVThere hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years
p204
aVbecause of the "NIMBY" problem \u2014 "Not In My BackYard."
p205
aVBut in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
p206
aVAnd coal-burning furnaces are going in there
p207
aVfor hydroelectric power literally weekly.
p208
aVSo coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
p209
aVAnd one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges \u2014
p210
aVa lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;
p211
aVsome of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
p212
aVAnd 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,
p213
aVdepending on whose statistics you're looking at.
p214
aVAnd this is what they were building.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
p217
aVThis is the town hall for the city.
p218
aVAnd again, the rebuilding of the city \u2014 to me, it was sad to see
p219
aVthat they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,
p220
aVwhat we know here, in terms of urban planning.
p221
aVThere were no parks; there were no green spaces.
p222
aVVery high-density living on the side of a hill.
p223
aVAnd here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,
p224
aVbut somehow were not connecting with them.
p225
aa(lp226
VHere is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.
p227
aVBuild our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
p228
aVSo here, if you look at this poster,
p229
aVit has all the trappings of Western culture.
p230
aVYou're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
p231
aVBut what's really, to me, frightening about the picture
p232
aVand about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
p233
aVSo it's like marrying up all the things that we have
p234
aVand it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
p235
aVAnd again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,
p236
aVand you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle
p237
aVwith a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle
p238
aVwith a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
p239
aa(lp240
VThis is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong \u2014
p241
aVand this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
p242
aVAnd there's about 130 million people in migration
p243
aVtrying to get into urban centers at all times,
p244
aVand in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting
p245
aVanother 400 to 500 million people to migrate
p246
aVinto the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
p247
aVThe manufacturers are \u2014
p248
aVthe domestics are usually \u2014 you can tell a domestic factory by the fact
p249
aVthat they all use the same color uniforms.
p250
aVSo this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
p251
aVAnd they have dorms for the workers.
p252
aVSo they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
p253
aa(lp254
VThis is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory
p255
aVnear Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
p256
aVThis is a shift change, one of three.
p257
aVThere's two factories of this scale in the same town.
p258
aVThis is one with 45,000, so every lunch,
p259
aVthere's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
p260
aVThey sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
p261
aVThe next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce
p262
aVthat's building there. Shanghai \u2014
p263
aVI'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,
p264
aVand this is a whole area that will be flattened
p265
aVand turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
p266
aa(lp267
VWhat's also happening in Shanghai is \u2014
p268
aVChina is changing because this wouldn't have happened
p269
aVfive years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
p270
aVThey're called dengzahoos \u2014 they're like pin tacks to the ground.
p271
aVThey won't move. They're not negotiating.
p272
aVThey're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
p273
aVAnd so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
p274
aVAnd they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals
p275
aVbecause most of them are getting a raw deal.
p276
aVThey're being put out about two hours \u2014
p277
aVthe communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,
p278
aVor maybe even thousands of years,
p279
aVare being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas
p280
aVoutside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys
p281
aVholding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
p282
aVProbably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,
p283
aVever attempted on the planet.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with \u2014
p286
aVagain, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,
p287
aVwas to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
p288
aVThe kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,
p289
aVand these are called the villas.
p290
aVAnd also, like right now, they're just moving.
p291
aVThe scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,
p292
aVand if you looked in the foreground on the big print,
p293
aVyou'd see that the industry \u2014 their industry \u2014 they're all recycling.
p294
aVSo the industry's already growing
p295
aVaround these new developments.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
p298
aVShanghai was a very intriguing city \u2014 it's exploding on a level
p299
aVthat I don't think any city has experienced.
p300
aVIn fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone \u2014
p301
aVone of the first ones \u2014 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,
p302
aVand today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
p303
aVSo that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which \u2014
p304
aVthis is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
p305
aVThere's 9,000 of them here,
p306
aVand they're being built for most of the big cities,
p307
aVBeijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
p308
aVAnd this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
p309
aVAnd what we would see here as a suburban development \u2014
p310
aVa similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
p311
aVSo they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,
p312
aVand they just go up in the same way
p313
aVas a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd the density is quite incredible.
p316
aVAnd one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out
p317
aVis that when I saw these kinds of buildings,
p318
aVI was shocked to see
p319
aVthat they're not using a central air-conditioning system;
p320
aVevery window has an air conditioner in it.
p321
aVAnd I'm sure there are people here who probably
p322
aVknow better than I do about efficiencies,
p323
aVbut I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner
p324
aVis a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
p325
aVAnd when you start looking at that,
p326
aVand then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,
p327
aVit's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
p328
aVIt's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
p329
aVAnd you can see in the foreground of this picture,
p330
aVit's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
p331
aVRight now that's all cleared out \u2014 this was done about eight months ago \u2014
p332
aVand high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
p333
aVSo a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
p334
aa(lp335
VMost recently I went in, and I started looking
p336
aVat some of the biggest industries in China.
p337
aVAnd this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
p338
aVThis is the coal supply for the steel factory \u2014 18 square kilometers.
p339
aVIt's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,
p340
aVfive cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
p341
aVSo they're building very large blast furnaces
p342
aVto try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
p343
aVSo this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
p344
aVAnd again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
p345
aVThis is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
p346
aV10 hours a day at this speed.
p347
aVI think one of the issues
p348
aVthat we here are facing with China,
p349
aVis that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
p350
aa(lp351
VIn that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
p352
aVAnd I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,
p353
aVand then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,
p354
aVand picked this one woman.
p355
aVAnd it was just lightning fast;
p356
aVthe way she was working was almost unbelievable.
p357
aVBut that is the trick that they've got right now,
p358
aVthat they're winning with, is that they're using
p359
aVall the latest technologies and extrusion machines,
p360
aVand bringing all the components into play,
p361
aVbut the assembly is where they're actually bringing in \u2014
p362
aVthe country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
p363
aVThere's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
p364
aVThat condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years
p365
aVif they realize what they want, which is, you know,
p366
aV400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
p367
aa(lp368
VIn this particular case \u2014 this is the assembly line that you saw;
p369
aVthis is a shot of it.
p370
aVI had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
p371
aVI had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
p372
aVIt took me five fake tries
p373
aVbecause they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
p374
aVThey were just wound up doing these things all day long,
p375
aVuntil the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,
p376
aV"Okay, everybody freeze."
p377
aVIt wasn't too bad,
p378
aVbut they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
p379
aa(lp380
VThis is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
p381
aVAnd what you're seeing here is,
p382
aVagain, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
p383
aVThere are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
p384
aVSo you have about 12 people running this,
p385
aVand they're just inspecting it \u2014 and they're just walking the lines.
p386
aVThe machines are all running,
p387
aVabsolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
p388
aVAnd I started getting in further and further into the factories.
p389
aVAnd that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings
p390
aVto try and get the sense of scale in these places.
p391
aVThis is a line where they get the threads
p392
aVand they wind the threads together,
p393
aVpre-going into the textile mills.
p394
aa(lp395
VHere's something that's far more labor-intensive,
p396
aVwhich is the making of shoes.
p397
aVThis floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
p398
aVThe company itself had about 10,000 employees,
p399
aVand they're doing domestic shoes.
p400
aVIt was very hard to get into the international companies
p401
aVbecause I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,
p402
aVand that's very hard to get.
p403
aVAnd they don't want to let me in.
p404
aVBut the domestic was much easier to do.
p405
aVIt just gives you a sense of, again \u2014 and that's where,
p406
aVreally, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China
p407
aVand making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
p408
aVIt was such a high labor component to it
p409
aVthat it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
p410
aa(lp411
VThis is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,
p412
aVone of the largest mobile makers in China.
p413
aVI think mobile phone companies
p414
aVare popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,
p415
aVand they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
p416
aVThis is a textile where they're doing shirts \u2014
p417
aVYoungor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
p418
aVAnd this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
p419
aVEverything is very efficient.
p420
aVWhile setting up this shot,
p421
aVpeople on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
p422
aVThis was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
p423
aVThey make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker
p424
aVand the biggest iron makers \u2014
p425
aVthey make 20 million of them in the world.
p426
aVThere's 21,000 employees. This one factory \u2014 and they had several of them \u2014
p427
aVis half a kilometer long.
p428
aVThese are just recently shot \u2014 I just came back about a month ago,
p429
aVso you're the first ones to be seeing these,
p430
aVthese new factory pictures I've taken.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
p433
aVThe other aspect of what's happening in China
p434
aVis that there's a real need for materials there.
p435
aVSo a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here
p436
aVare being recycled and taken to China by ships.
p437
aVThat's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,
p438
aVwhere they're getting the copper and the high-end steel
p439
aVfrom electrical motors out, and recycling them.
p440
aVThis is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
p441
aVBut this is what happens to most of the computers.
p442
aVFifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
p443
aa(lp444
VIt's referred to as "e-waste" there.
p445
aVAnd it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards
p446
aVis that they actually use the coal briquettes,
p447
aVwhich are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,
p448
aVand with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
p449
aVThey're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
p450
aVBut the toxic smells \u2014 when you come into a town
p451
aVthat's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,
p452
aVyou can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
p453
aVHere's another operation. It's all cottage industries,
p454
aVso it's not big places \u2014 it's all in people's front porches,
p455
aVin their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,
p456
aa(lp457
Vif there's a concern for somebody coming by \u2014
p458
aVbecause it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,
p459
aVbut they can't stop the product from coming in.
p460
aVThis portrait \u2014 I'm not usually known for portraits,
p461
aVbut I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,
p462
aVand she's been through the Great Leap Forward,
p463
aVand the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch
p464
aVwith this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
p465
aVThis is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards
p466
aVin one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
p467
aVSo that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
p468
aa(lp469
V(Applause)
p470
aa(lp471
VI want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
p472
aVThey've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
p473
aVOne's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
p474
aVAnd to me the whole notion \u2014
p475
aVthe things I'm photographing are out of a great concern
p476
aVabout the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
p477
aVAnd as much as there are great things around the corner \u2014
p478
aVand it's palpable in this room \u2014
p479
aVof all of the things that are just about to break
p480
aVthat can solve so many problems,
p481
aVI'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world
p482
aVand will start to have a positive effect.
p483
aVAnd it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,
p484
aVbut it starts to go up \u2014 because I think we can start correcting
p485
aVour footprint and bring it down \u2014 but there's a growing footprint
p486
aVthat's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,
p487
aVand so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,
p488
aVI think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
p489
aVbecause it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
p490
aa(lp491
VSo part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,
p492
aVis sitting with these thoughts in mind,
p493
aVand thinking about,
p494
aV"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,
p495
aVor when they're ready to get married 20 years from now \u2014 or whatever,
p496
aV15 years from now?"
p497
aVAnd to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking \u2014
p498
aVin my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
p499
aVWish one: world-changing. I want to use my images
p500
aVto persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
p501
aVAnd it is through communications today
p502
aVthat I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
p503
aVOh, and I went in search \u2014 I wanted to put what I had in mind,
p504
aVhitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
p505
aa(lp506
VOne of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,
p507
aVI wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
p508
aVAnd Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog
p509
aVis now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
p510
aVAnd it just started about 14 months ago.
p511
aVAnd the beauty of what's going on there
p512
aVis that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
p513
aVWhat they're doing there is that they're not \u2014
p514
aVI think the environmental movement has failed
p515
aVin that it's used the stick too much;
p516
aVit's used the apocalyptic tone too much;
p517
aVit hasn't sold the positive aspects of
p518
aVbeing environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
p519
aVWhereas this conversation that is going on in this blog
p520
aVis about positive movements,
p521
aVabout how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
p522
aVAnd it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,
p523
aVand it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize
p524
aVthe movement towards sustainability.
p525
aa(lp526
VAnd so for me, one of the things that I thought
p527
aVwould be to put some of my work in the service of promoting
p528
aVthe Worldchanging.com website.
p529
aVSome of you might know, he's a TEDster \u2014 Stephen Sagmeister and I
p530
aVare working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;
p531
aVthese aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,
p532
aVcan be placed into any kind of media.
p533
aVThey could be posted through the Web;
p534
aVthey could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
p535
aVSo we're looking at this as trying to build out.
p536
aVAnd what we ended up discussing
p537
aVwas that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,
p538
aVand the text is blasted all over.
p539
aa(lp540
VWhat was unusual, according to Stephen,
p541
aVis less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
p542
aVAnd so in this case,
p543
aVbecause it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,
p544
aVand the kinds of questions they bring up,
p545
aVthat we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,
p546
aV"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
p547
aVAnd hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
p548
aVSo Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,
p549
aVand I'm hoping that it isn't \u2014 I don't see it as the kind of blog
p550
aVwhere we're all going to follow each other to death.
p551
aVThis one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,
p552
aVand to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations
p553
aVin India, in China, in South America \u2014
p554
aVthere's entries coming from all around the world.
p555
aVI think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation
p556
aVabout sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
p557
aVAnd anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
p558
aa(lp559
VWish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
p560
aVAnd this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition
p561
aVthat motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
p562
aVAnd one of the things that came out \u2014
p563
aVAllison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on
p564
aVin a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada
p565
aVhad a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
p566
aVAnd you think about it, you know,
p567
aVgrade four \u2014 my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,
p568
aVso they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
p569
aVSo it's this great window where they actually are \u2014
p570
aVyou can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
p571
aVYou know, we know that from earlier presentations.
p572
aa(lp573
VSo my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
p574
aVto start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,
p575
aVand that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
p576
aVAnd one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,
p577
aVso I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,
p578
aVand the rest is going to be to manage this project,
p579
aVbut to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
p580
aVBut the other thing that I thought would be fantastic
p581
aVwas to create these \u2014 call them "prize targets."
p582
aVAnd so one could be for the best sustainable idea
p583
aVfor an in-school project, the best one for a household project,
p584
aVor it could be the best community project for sustainability.
p585
aa(lp586
VAnd I also thought there should be a nice prize
p587
aVfor the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen \u2014
p588
aVit's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things \u2014
p589
aVwhether it's equipment, like a media lab,
p590
aVor money to make the prize significant enough \u2014
p591
aVand to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,
p592
aVor schools that are with kids that age,
p593
aVand make it a wide-open competition for them
p594
aVto go after those prizes and to submit them.
p595
aVAnd the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
p596
aVThe art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them
p597
aVand do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
p598
aVIn that way, what's happening is that
p599
aVwe're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
p600
aVAnd they're going to push that up, from the bottom \u2014 up into,
p601
aVI believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,
p602
aVand trying to help them with the projects.
p603
aa(lp604
VAnd I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
p605
aVin a very positive way,
p606
aVand starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,
p607
aVbut they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,
p608
aVand the energy footprint, and how that matters.
p609
aVAnd to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,
p610
aVand it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
p611
aVAnd again, in "In My World," the competition \u2014
p612
aVwe would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
p613
aVAnd I like the words, "in my world,"
p614
aVbecause it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
p615
aVIt is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;
p616
aVI want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity
p617
aVto engage the imaginations \u2014 and great ideas, I think, come from kids \u2014
p618
aVand engage their imagination into a project,
p619
aVand do something for schools.
p620
aVI think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash \u2014
p621
aVit's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
p622
aVAnd these are some of the ideas in terms of where
p623
aVwe could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
p624
aa(lp625
VAnd wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,
p626
aVand I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
p627
aVAnd the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with \u2014
p628
aVwhen I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,
p629
aV"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do
p630
aVand the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
p631
aVAnd I think there's a real possibility
p632
aVto reach new audiences if I had a chance.
p633
aVSo I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
p634
aVI'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now \u2014
p635
aVI'm too busy. So I need somebody
p636
aVwho can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,
p637
aVand lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
p638
aVThat would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.
