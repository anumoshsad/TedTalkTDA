(lp3
VI'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,
p4
aVshe said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."
p5
aa(lp6
VI said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."
p7
aa(lp8
VShe said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented \u2014 "
p9
aa(lp10
VI said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VShe said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,
p16
aVI'm gonna be good. I am."
p17
aVBut I am angry. (Laughter)
p18
aVAnd the last time I looked, I'm \u2014
p19
aa(lp20
V(Applause)
p21
aVSo this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.
p22
aVThis year, there are going to be millions of our children
p23
aVthat we're going to needlessly lose,
p24
aVthat we could \u2014 right now, we could save them all.
p25
aVYou saw the quality of the educators who were here.
p26
aVDo not tell me they could not reach those kids
p27
aVand save them. I know they could.
p28
aVIt is absolutely possible.
p29
aVWhy haven't we fixed this?
p30
aVThose of us in education have held on to a business plan
p31
aVthat we don't care how many millions of young people fail,
p32
aVwe're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,
p33
aVand nobody is getting crazy about it \u2014 right? \u2014
p34
aVenough to say, "Enough is enough."
p35
aVSo here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.
p36
aa(lp37
VYou know, I grew up in the inner city,
p38
aVand there were kids who were failing
p39
aVin schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,
p40
aVand those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.
p41
aVAnd you know something about a lousy school?
p42
aVIt's not like a bottle of wine.
p43
aVRight? (Laughter)
p44
aVWhere you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?
p45
aVThat's now how this thing \u2014 I mean, every single year,
p46
aVit's still the same approach, right?
p47
aVOne size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,
p48
aVtough luck. Just tough luck.
p49
aVWhy haven't we allowed innovation to happen?
p50
aVDo not tell me we can't do better than this.
p51
aa(lp52
VLook, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,
p53
aVand you say, "So what's the plan?"
p54
aVAnd they say, "We'll, we're going to do
p55
aVwhat we did last year this year."
p56
aVWhat kind of business model is that?
p57
aVBanks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.
p58
aVThey operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.
p59
aVNow, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.
p60
aVThey don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.
p61
aVWho created that business model? Right?
p62
aVAnd it went on for decades.
p63
aVYou know why? Because they didn't care.
p64
aVIt wasn't about the customers.
p65
aVIt was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.
p66
aVHow could you go to the bank
p67
aVwhen you were at work? It didn't matter.
p68
aVAnd they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset
p69
aVhe can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.
p70
aVThey all operate the same way. Right?
p71
aVNow, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.
p72
aVMaybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.
p73
aVThey might like that. What about a Saturday?
p74
aVWhat about introducing technology?
p75
aa(lp76
VNow look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit
p77
aVto you all I'm a little old.
p78
aVSo I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,
p79
aVand when they first came out with those new contraptions,
p80
aVthese tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,
p81
aVI was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.
p82
aVI am never using that, right?"
p83
aa(lp84
VSo technology has changed. Things have changed.
p85
aVYet not in education. Why?
p86
aVWhy is it that when we had rotary phones,
p87
aVwhen we were having folks being crippled by polio,
p88
aVthat we were teaching
p89
aVthe same way then that we're doing right now?
p90
aVAnd if you come up with a plan to change things,
p91
aVpeople consider you radical.
p92
aVThey will say the worst things about you.
p93
aVI said one day, well, look, if the science says \u2014
p94
aVthis is science, not me \u2014 that our poorest children
p95
aVlose ground in the summertime \u2014
p96
aVYou see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.
p97
aVYou look at them in September, they've gone down.
p98
aVYou say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75
p99
aVwhen I was at the Ed School at Harvard.
p100
aVI said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."
p101
aVBecause it suggests we should do something.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVEvery 10 years they reproduce the same study.
p104
aVIt says exactly the same thing:
p105
aVPoor kids lose ground in the summertime.
p106
aVThe system decides you can't run schools in the summer.
p107
aa(lp108
VYou know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?
p109
aVFor years I went to \u2014 Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.
p110
aVI thought I knew something.
p111
aVThey said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had \u2014
p112
aVbut let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.
p113
aVI never got that. I never got that,
p114
aVbecause anyone knows if you farm,
p115
aVyou don't plant crops in July and August.
p116
aVYou plant them in the spring.
p117
aVSo who came up with this idea? Who owns it?
p118
aVWhy did we ever do it?
p119
aVWell it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,
p120
aVschools were open all year. They were open all year,
p121
aVbecause we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.
p122
aVThey didn't have any place for their kids to go.
p123
aVIt was a perfect place to have schools.
p124
aVSo this is not something that is ordained
p125
aVfrom the education gods.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo why don't we? Why don't we?
p128
aVBecause our business has refused to use science.
p129
aVScience. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,
p130
aV"Look, this works, right? We can do this."
p131
aVHow many places in America are going to change? None.
p132
aVNone. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?
p133
aVYes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.
p134
aVAs a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.
p135
aa(lp136
VHere's what we know.
p137
aVWe know that the problem begins immediately.
p138
aVRight? This idea, zero to three.
p139
aVMy wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,
p140
aVthree grown ones and a 15-year-old.
p141
aVThat's a longer story.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVWith our first kids, we did not know the science
p144
aVabout brain development.
p145
aVWe didn't know how critical those first three years were.
p146
aVWe didn't know what was happening in those young brains.
p147
aVWe didn't know the role that language,
p148
aVa stimulus and response, call and response,
p149
aVhow important that was in developing those children.
p150
aVWe know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.
p151
aVWealthy people know. Educated people know.
p152
aVAnd their kids have an advantage.
p153
aVPoor people don't know,
p154
aVand we're not doing anything to help them at all.
p155
aVBut we know this is critical.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, you take pre-kindergarten.
p158
aVWe know it's important for kids.
p159
aVPoor kids need that experience.
p160
aVNope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.
p161
aVWe know health services matter.
p162
aVYou know, we provide health services
p163
aVand people are always fussing at me about, you know,
p164
aVbecause I'm all into accountability and data
p165
aVand all of that good stuff, but we do health services,
p166
aVand I have to raise a lot of money.
p167
aVPeople used to say when they'd come fund us,
p168
aV"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"
p169
aVI used to make stuff up. Right?
p170
aVI'd say, "Well, you know a child
p171
aVwho has cavities is not going to, uh,
p172
aVbe able to study as well."
p173
aVAnd I had to because I had to raise the money.
p174
aVBut now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?
p175
aVYou know why I provide kids with those health benefits
p176
aVand the sports and the recreation and the arts?
p177
aVBecause I actually like kids.
p178
aVI actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,
p181
aVI say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."
p182
aVAnd you've never read a study from MIT that says
p183
aVgiving your kid dance instruction
p184
aVis going to help them do algebra better,
p185
aVbut you will give that kid dance instruction,
p186
aVand you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,
p187
aVand it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids
p188
aVhave the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.
p189
aV(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VSo here's the other thing.
p192
aVI'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,
p193
aVbecause you work at something, you think it's working,
p194
aVand you find out it's not working.
p195
aVI mean, you're educators. You work, you say,
p196
aVyou think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.
p197
aVBut here's the problem with testing.
p198
aVThe testing that we do \u2014
p199
aVwe're going to have our test in New York next week \u2014
p200
aVis in April.
p201
aVYou know when we're going to get the results back?
p202
aVMaybe July, maybe June.
p203
aVAnd the results have great data.
p204
aVThey'll tell you Raheem really struggled,
p205
aVcouldn't do two-digit multiplication \u2014 so great data,
p206
aVbut you're getting it back after school is over.
p207
aVAnd so, what do you do?
p208
aVYou go on vacation. (Laughter)
p209
aVYou come back from vacation.
p210
aVNow you've got all of this test data from last year.
p211
aVYou don't look at it.
p212
aVWhy would you look at it?
p213
aVYou're going to go and teach this year.
p214
aVSo how much money did we just spend on all of that?
p215
aVBillions and billions of dollars
p216
aVfor data that it's too late to use.
p217
aVI need that data in September.
p218
aVI need that data in November.
p219
aVI need to know you're struggling, and I need to know
p220
aVwhether or not what I did corrected that.
p221
aVI need to know that this week.
p222
aVI don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.
p223
aa(lp224
VBecause in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.
p225
aVI can predict school scores.
p226
aVYou take me to any school.
p227
aVI'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.
p228
aVAnd you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids
p229
aVwere on grade level.
p230
aVAnd I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do
p231
aVfrom last year to this year?"
p232
aVYou say, "We're doing the same thing."
p233
aVI'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)
p234
aVThis year, somewhere between 44
p235
aVand 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.
p236
aVAnd I will be right every single time.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?
p239
aVTeachers need real information right now
p240
aVabout what's happening to their kids.
p241
aVThe high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo here's the other issue that I just think
p244
aVwe've got to be concerned about.
p245
aVWe can't stifle innovation in our business.
p246
aVWe have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.
p247
aVThey get angry if you do something different.
p248
aVIf you try something new, people are always like,
p249
aV"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.
p250
aVThis stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.
p251
aVLet's try something different. And here's the rub.
p252
aVSome of it's not going to work.
p253
aVYou know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."
p254
aVA lot of them don't. They should be closed.
p255
aVI mean, I really believe they should be closed.
p256
aVBut we can't confuse figuring out the science
p257
aVand things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.
p258
aVRight? Because that's not the way the world works.
p259
aa(lp260
VIf you think about technology,
p261
aVimagine if that's how we thought about technology.
p262
aVEvery time something didn't work,
p263
aVwe just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?
p264
aVYou know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me \u2014
p265
aVthe latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.
p266
aVThey told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot
p267
aVyou'll never need another thing."
p268
aVThat thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.
p269
aVI was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.
p270
aVDid anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.
p271
aVThe folks went out there. They kept inventing.
p272
aVThe fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you
p273
aVfrom pushing the science forward.
p274
aa(lp275
VOur job as educators,
p276
aVthere's some stuff we know that we can do.
p277
aVAnd we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,
p278
aVwe have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.
p279
aVWe've got to give them all of these opportunities.
p280
aVSo that we have to do. But this innovation issue,
p281
aVthis idea that we've got to keep innovating
p282
aVuntil we really nail this science down
p283
aVis something that is absolutely critical.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd this is something, by the way,
p286
aVthat I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.
p287
aVAmerica cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.
p288
aVWe have run out of time.
p289
aVI don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff
p290
aVthat we are walking over right this very second,
p291
aVand if we allow folks to continue this foolishness
p292
aVabout saying we can't afford this \u2014
p293
aVSo Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.
p294
aVWhat is five billion dollars to the United States?
p295
aVWhat did we spend in Afghanistan this year?
p296
aVHow many trillions? (Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VWhen the country cares about something,
p299
aVwe'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.
p300
aVWhen the safety of America is threatened,
p301
aVwe will spend any amount of money.
p302
aVThe real safety of our nation
p303
aVis preparing this next generation
p304
aVso that they can take our place
p305
aVand be the leaders of the world
p306
aVwhen it comes to thinking and technology and democracy
p307
aVand all that stuff we care about.
p308
aVI dare say it's a pittance,
p309
aVwhat it would require for us to really
p310
aVbegin to solve some of these problems.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)
p313
aVSo, you guys, help me get there.
p314
aVThank you all very much. Thank you.
p315
aV(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VJohn Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?
p318
aa(lp319
VGeoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,
p320
aV100 percent of our kids graduated high school
p321
aVlast year in my school.
p322
aVA hundred percent of them went to college.
p323
aVThis year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.
p324
aVLast I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.
p325
aVWe'd better get that other seven percent.
p326
aVSo that's just how this goes. (Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VJL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?
p329
aa(lp330
VGC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems
p331
aVwe have in this country is these kids, the same kids,
p332
aVthese same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,
p333
aVthey drop out in record numbers.
p334
aVAnd so we've figured out that you've got to really design
p335
aVa network of support for these kids that in many ways
p336
aVmimics what a good parent does.
p337
aVThey harass you, right? They call you, they say,
p338
aV"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?
p339
aVWhat are you talking about that you want to leave school?
p340
aVAnd you're not coming back here."
p341
aVSo a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem
p342
aVbecause Geoff is looking for you.
p343
aVThey're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.
p344
aVBut I'm not kidding about some of this,
p345
aVand it gets a little bit to the grit issue.
p346
aVWhen kids know that you refuse to let them fail,
p347
aVit puts a different pressure on them,
p348
aVand they don't give up as easy.
p349
aVSo sometimes they don't have it inside,
p350
aVand they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,
p351
aVbut I know my mother's going to be mad."
p352
aVWell, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.
p353
aVWe try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring
p354
aVand help and support, but also a set of encouragements
p355
aVthat say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,
p356
aVbut we refuse to let you fail."
p357
aa(lp358
VJL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.
p359
aVPlease give it up for him one more time.
