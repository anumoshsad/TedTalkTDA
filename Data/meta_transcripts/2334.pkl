VSo I've had the great privilege
p4
aVof traveling to some incredible places,
p5
aVphotographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures
p6
aVall over the world.
p7
aVI love my job.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut people think it's this string of epiphanies
p10
aVand sunrises and rainbows,
p11
aVwhen in reality, it looks more something like this.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VThis is my office.
p16
aa(lp17
VWe can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night,
p18
aVso we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.
p19
aVAs long as we can stay dry,
p20
aVthat's a bonus.
p21
aVWe also can't afford the fanciest restaurants.
p22
aVSo we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu.
p23
aVAnd if you're in the Ecuadorian Páramo,
p24
aVyou're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VBut what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different
p29
aVand a little more unique than that of the average person
p30
aVis that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind
p31
aVthat even in our darkest moments, and those times of despair,
p32
aVwe think, "Hey, there might be an image to be made here,
p33
aVthere might be a story to be told."
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd why is storytelling important?
p36
aVWell, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage.
p37
aVAnd in the Southeast,
p38
aVthere's an alarming disconnect between the public
p39
aVand the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place.
p40
aVWe're visual creatures,
p41
aVso we use what we see to teach us what we know.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow the majority of us aren't going to willingly go
p44
aVway down to a swamp.
p45
aVSo how can we still expect those same people to then advocate
p46
aVon behalf of their protection?
p47
aVWe can't.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo my job, then, is to use photography as a communication tool,
p50
aVto help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics,
p51
aVto get people talking,
p52
aVto get them thinking,
p53
aVand to hopefully, ultimately,
p54
aVget them caring.
p55
aa(lp56
VI started doing this 15 years ago right here in Gainesville,
p57
aVright here in my backyard.
p58
aVAnd I fell in love with adventure and discovery,
p59
aVgoing to explore all these different places
p60
aVthat were just minutes from my front doorstep.
p61
aVThere are a lot of beautiful places to find.
p62
aVDespite all these years that have passed,
p63
aVI still see the world through the eyes of a child
p64
aVand I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment
p65
aVand that sense of curiosity into my photography
p66
aVas often as I can.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd we're pretty lucky because here in the South,
p69
aVwe're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas
p70
aVthat we can fill with the most fanciful adventures
p71
aVand incredible experiences.
p72
aVIt's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us.
p73
aVSee, a lot of people look at this and they say,
p74
aV"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."
p75
aVBut I don't just see a tree \u2014
p76
aVI look at this and I see opportunity.
p77
aVI see an entire weekend.
p78
aVBecause when I was a kid, these were the types of images
p79
aVthat got me off the sofa and dared me to explore,
p80
aVdared me to go find the woods
p81
aVand put my head underwater and see what we have.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd folks, I've been photographing all over the world
p84
aVand I promise you,
p85
aVwhat we have here in the South,
p86
aVwhat we have in the Sunshine State,
p87
aVrivals anything else that I've seen.
p88
aVBut yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things.
p89
aVBefore most kids are 12, they'll have been to Disney World
p90
aVmore times than they've been in a canoe
p91
aVor camping under a starry sky.
p92
aVAnd I have nothing against Disney or Mickey; I used to go there, too.
p93
aVBut they're missing out on those fundamental connections
p94
aVthat create a real sense of pride and ownership
p95
aVfor the place that they call home.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes
p98
aVthat define our natural heritage
p99
aVand fuel our aquifer for our drinking water
p100
aVhave been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky.
p101
aVWhen our ancestors first came here,
p102
aVthey warned, "Stay out of these areas, they're haunted.
p103
aVThey're full of evil spirits and ghosts."
p104
aVI don't know where they came up with that idea.
p105
aVBut it's actually led to a very real disconnect,
p106
aVa very real negative mentality
p107
aVthat has kept the public disinterested, silent,
p108
aVand ultimately, our environment at risk.
p109
aVWe're a state that's surrounded and defined by water,
p110
aVand yet for centuries,
p111
aVswamps and wetlands have been regarded
p112
aVas these obstacles to overcome.
p113
aVAnd so we've treated them as these second-class ecosystems,
p114
aVbecause they have very little monetary value
p115
aVand of course, they're known to harbor alligators and snakes \u2014
p116
aVwhich, I'll admit, these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VSo it became assumed, then, that the only good swamp
p121
aVwas a drained swamp.
p122
aVAnd in fact,
p123
aVdraining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development
p124
aVwas considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut now we're backpedaling,
p127
aVbecause the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes,
p128
aVthe more secrets we're starting to unlock
p129
aVabout interspecies relationships
p130
aVand the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways.
p131
aVTake this bird, for example:
p132
aVthis is the prothonotary warbler.
p133
aVI love this bird because it's a swamp bird,
p134
aVthrough and through, a swamp bird.
p135
aVThey nest and they mate and they breed in these old-growth swamps
p136
aVin these flooded forests.
p137
aVAnd so after the spring, after they raise their young,
p138
aVthey then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico
p139
aVinto Central and South America.
p140
aVAnd then after the winter,
p141
aVthe spring rolls around and they come back.
p142
aVThey fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico.
p143
aVAnd where do they go? Where do they land?
p144
aVRight back in the same tree.
p145
aVThat's nuts.
p146
aVThis is a bird the size of a tennis ball \u2014
p147
aVI mean, that's crazy!
p148
aVI used a GPS to get here today,
p149
aVand this is my hometown.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VIt's crazy.
p154
aVSo what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico
p155
aVinto Central America for the winter
p156
aVand then the spring rolls around and it flies back,
p157
aVand it comes back to this:
p158
aVa freshly sodded golf course?
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling
p161
aVhere in this state.
p162
aVAnd this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years
p163
aVand we're just now learning about it.
p164
aVSo you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes
p165
aVif we just preserve them first.
p166
aVNow despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps,
p167
aVthey still have a bad name.
p168
aa(lp169
VMany people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading
p170
aVinto Florida's blackwater.
p171
aVI can understand that.
p172
aVBut what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State
p173
aVis that for so many of us,
p174
aVwe live with this latent but very palpable fear
p175
aVthat when we put our toes into the water,
p176
aVthere might be something much more ancient
p177
aVand much more adapted than we are.
p178
aVKnowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort, I think.
p179
aVHow often in this modern and urban and digital age
p180
aVdo you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable,
p181
aVor consider that the world may not have been made for just us?
p182
aa(lp183
VSo for the last decade,
p184
aVI began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest
p185
aVand the pines turn to cypress,
p186
aVand I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles,
p187
aVall these discomforts,
p188
aVas affirmations that I'd found true wilderness,
p189
aVand I embrace them wholly.
p190
aVNow as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater,
p191
aVit's only fitting that I'd eventually end up
p192
aVin the most famous swamp of all:
p193
aVthe Everglades.
p194
aa(lp195
VGrowing up here in North Central Florida,
p196
aVit always had these enchanted names,
p197
aVplaces like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,
p198
aVCorkscrew, Big Cypress.
p199
aVI started what turned into a five-year project
p200
aVto hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light,
p201
aVin a more inspired light.
p202
aVBut I knew this would be a tall order, because here you have an area
p203
aVthat's roughly a third the size the state of Florida, it's huge.
p204
aVAnd when I say Everglades,
p205
aVmost people are like, "Oh, yeah, the national park."
p206
aVBut the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed,
p207
aVstarting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north,
p208
aVand then as the rains would fall in the summer,
p209
aVthese downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee,
p210
aVand Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks
p211
aVand spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography,
p212
aVand get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies,
p213
aVbefore meting into the cypress slews,
p214
aVuntil going further south into the mangrove swamps,
p215
aVand then finally \u2014 finally \u2014 reaching Florida Bay,
p216
aVthe emerald gem of the Everglades,
p217
aVthe great estuary,
p218
aVthe 850 square-mile estuary.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo sure, the national park is the southern end of this system,
p221
aVbut all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in,
p222
aVthe fresh water that starts 100 miles north.
p223
aVSo no manner of these political or invisible boundaries
p224
aVprotect the park from polluted water or insufficient water.
p225
aVAnd unfortunately, that's precisely what we've done.
p226
aVOver the last 60 years,
p227
aVwe have drained, we have dammed, we have dredged the Everglades
p228
aVto where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay
p229
aVnow reaches the bay today.
p230
aVSo this story is not all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately.
p231
aVFor better or for worse,
p232
aVthe story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied
p233
aVto the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship
p234
aVwith the natural world.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut I'll show you these beautiful pictures,
p237
aVbecause it gets you on board.
p238
aVAnd while I have your attention, I can tell you the real story.
p239
aVIt's that we're taking this,
p240
aVand we're trading it for this,
p241
aVat an alarming rate.
p242
aVAnd what's lost on so many people
p243
aVis the sheer scale of which we're discussing.
p244
aVBecause the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water
p245
aVfor 7 million Floridians;
p246
aVtoday it also provides the agricultural fields
p247
aVfor the year-round tomatoes and oranges
p248
aVfor over 300 million Americans.
p249
aVAnd it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer
p250
aVthat built the river of grass 6,000 years ago.
p251
aVIronically, today, it's also responsible for the over half a million acres
p252
aVof the endless river of sugarcane.
p253
aVThese are the same fields that are responsible
p254
aVfor dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed,
p255
aVforever changing the system.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut in order for you to not just understand how this system works,
p258
aVbut to also get personally connected to it,
p259
aVI decided to break the story down into several different narratives.
p260
aVAnd I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee,
p261
aVthe beating heart of the Everglade system.
p262
aVAnd to do that, I picked an ambassador,
p263
aVan iconic species.
p264
aVThis is the Everglade snail kite.
p265
aVIt's a great bird,
p266
aVand they used to nest in the thousands,
p267
aVthousands in the northern Everglades.
p268
aVAnd then they've gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today.
p269
aVAnd why is that?
p270
aVWell, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail,
p271
aVabout the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo as we started damming up the Everglades,
p274
aVas we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands,
p275
aVwe lost the habitat for the snail.
p276
aVAnd thus, the population of the kites declined.
p277
aVAnd so, I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship
p278
aVbetween wetland, snail and bird,
p279
aVbut I also wanted a photo that would communicate
p280
aVhow incredible this relationship was,
p281
aVand how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other,
p282
aVthis healthy wetland and this bird.
p283
aVAnd to do that, I brainstormed this idea.
p284
aVI started sketching out these plans to make a photo,
p285
aVand I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee \u2014
p286
aVthis is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do.
p287
aVSo I built this submerged platform
p288
aVthat would hold snails just right under the water.
p289
aVAnd I spent months planning this crazy idea.
p290
aVAnd I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee
p291
aVand I spent over a week in the water,
p292
aVwading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,
p293
aVto get one image that I thought might communicate this.
p294
aVAnd here's the day that it finally worked:
p295
aa(lp296
V[Video: (Mac Stone narrating) After setting up the platform,
p297
aVI look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails.
p298
aVAnd I see him scanning and searching.
p299
aVAnd he gets right over the trap,
p300
aVand I see that he's seen it.
p301
aVAnd he beelines, he goes straight for the trap.
p302
aVAnd in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting,
p303
aVall the sunburn, mosquito bites \u2014
p304
aVsuddenly, they're all worth it.
p305
aV(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!]
p306
aa(lp307
VYou can believe how excited I was when that happened.
p308
aVBut what the idea was,
p309
aVis that for someone who's never seen this bird
p310
aVand has no reason to care about it,
p311
aVthese photos, these new perspectives,
p312
aVwill help shed a little new light on just one species
p313
aVthat makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important.
p314
aVNow, I know I can't come here to Gainesville
p315
aVand talk to you about animals in the Everglades
p316
aVwithout talking about gators.
p317
aVI love gators, I grew up loving gators.
p318
aVMy parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators.
p319
aVBut what I like about them is,
p320
aVthey're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks.
p321
aVThey're feared, they're hated,
p322
aVand they are tragically misunderstood.
p323
aVBecause these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators.
p324
aVIn the Everglades,
p325
aVthey are the very architects of the Everglades,
p326
aVbecause as the water drops down in the winter
p327
aVduring the dry season,
p328
aVthey start excavating these holes called gator holes.
p329
aVAnd they do this because as the water drops down,
p330
aVthey'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage.
p331
aVAnd now this isn't just affecting them,
p332
aVother animals also depend on this relationship,
p333
aVso they become a keystone species as well.
p334
aVSo how do you make an apex predator, an ancient reptile,
p335
aVat once look like it dominates the system,
p336
aVbut at the same time, look vulnerable?
p337
aVWell, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them,
p338
aVthen you hope that you've made the right decision.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VI still have all my fingers, it's cool.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut I understand, I know I'm not going to rally you guys,
p345
aVI'm not going to rally the troops to "Save the Everglades for the gators!"
p346
aVIt won't happen because they're so ubiquitous,
p347
aVwe see them now,
p348
aVthey're one of the great conservation success stories of the US.
p349
aVBut there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are,
p350
aVyou can't help but love, too, and that's the roseate spoonbill.
p351
aVThese birds are great, but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades,
p352
aVbecause they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,
p353
aVand at the turn of the 20th century,
p354
aVthey got down to two \u2014 two nesting pairs.
p355
aVAnd why?
p356
aVThat's because women thought they looked better on their hats
p357
aVthen they did flying in the sky.
p358
aVThen we banned the plume trade,
p359
aVand their numbers started rebounding.
p360
aVAnd as their numbers started rebounding,
p361
aVscientists began to pay attention,
p362
aVthey started studying these birds.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd what they found out is that
p365
aVthese birds' behavior is intrinsically tied
p366
aVto the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades,
p367
aVthe thing that defines the Everglades watershed.
p368
aVWhat they found out is that
p369
aVthese birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down,
p370
aVbecause they're tactile feeders, so they have to touch whatever they eat.
p371
aVAnd so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish
p372
aVto be able to feed enough to feed their young.
p373
aVSo these birds became the very icon of the Everglades \u2014
p374
aVan indicator species of the overall health of the system.
p375
aVAnd just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century \u2014
p376
aVshooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 \u2014
p377
aVjust as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades.
p378
aVAnd we stopped two-thirds of that water from moving south.
p379
aVAnd it had drastic consequences.
p380
aVAnd just as those numbers started reaching their peak,
p381
aVunfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story,
p382
aVthe real photo of what it looks like is more something like this.
p383
aVAnd we're down to less than 70 nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,
p384
aVbecause we've disrupted the system so much.
p385
aVSo all these different organizations are shouting, they're screaming,
p386
aV"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"
p387
aVIt is not.
p388
aVIt is resilient.
p389
aVBecause despite all we've taken, despite all we've done and we've drained
p390
aVand we've dammed and we've dredged it,
p391
aVpieces of it are still here, waiting to be put back together.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd this is what I've loved about South Florida,
p394
aVthat in one place, you have this unstoppable force of mankind
p395
aVmeeting the immovable object of tropical nature.
p396
aVAnd it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal.
p397
aVWhat is wilderness worth?
p398
aVWhat is the value of biodiversity, or our drinking water?
p399
aVAnd fortunately, after decades of debate,
p400
aVwe're finally starting to act on those questions.
p401
aVWe're slowly undertaking these projects
p402
aVto bring more freshwater back to the bay.
p403
aVBut it's up to us as citizens, as residents, as stewards
p404
aVto hold our elected officials to their promises.
p405
aa(lp406
VWhat can you do to help?
p407
aVIt's so easy.
p408
aVJust get outside, get out there.
p409
aVTake your friends out, take your kids out,
p410
aVtake your family out.
p411
aVHire a fishing guide.
p412
aVShow the state that protecting wilderness
p413
aVnot only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well.
p414
aVIt's a lot of fun, just do it \u2014 put your feet in the water.
p415
aVThe swamp will change you, I promise.
p416
aa(lp417
VOver the years, we've been so generous
p418
aVwith these other landscapes around the country,
p419
aVcloaking them with this American pride,
p420
aVplaces that we now consider to define us:
p421
aVGrand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.
p422
aVAnd we use these parks and these natural areas
p423
aVas beacons and as cultural compasses.
p424
aVAnd sadly, the Everglades is very commonly
p425
aVleft out of that conversation.
p426
aVBut I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic
p427
aVof who we are as a country
p428
aVas any of these other wildernesses.
p429
aVIt's just a different kind of wild.
p430
aa(lp431
VBut I'm encouraged,
p432
aVbecause maybe we're finally starting to come around,
p433
aVbecause what was once deemed this swampy wasteland,
p434
aVtoday is a World Heritage site.
p435
aVIt's a wetland of international importance.
p436
aVAnd we've come a long way in the last 60 years.
p437
aVAnd as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project,
p438
aVthe international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State.
p439
aVBecause if we can heal this system,
p440
aVit's going to become an icon for wetland restoration
p441
