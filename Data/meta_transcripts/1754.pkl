VHow many of you have checked your email today?
p4
aVCome on, raise your hands.
p5
aVHow many of you are checking it right now?
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd how about finances? Anybody check that today?
p10
aVCredit card, investment account?
p11
aVHow about this week?
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, how about your household energy use?
p14
aVAnybody check that today?
p15
aVThis week? Last week?
p16
aVA few energy geeks spread out across the room.
p17
aVIt's good to see you guys.
p18
aVBut the rest of us \u2014 this is a room filled with people
p19
aVwho are passionate about the future of this planet,
p20
aVand even we aren't paying attention
p21
aVto the energy use that's driving climate change.
p22
aVThe woman in the photo with me is Harriet.
p23
aVWe met her on our first family vacation.
p24
aVHarriet's paying attention to her energy use,
p25
aVand she is decidedly not an energy geek.
p26
aVThis is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is coal,
p29
aVthe most common source of electricity on the planet,
p30
aVand there's enough energy in this coal
p31
aVto light this bulb for more than a year.
p32
aVBut unfortunately, between here and here,
p33
aVmost of that energy is lost to things
p34
aVlike transmission leakage and heat.
p35
aVIn fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.
p36
aVSo this coal will last a little bit more than a month.
p37
aVIf you wanted to light this bulb for a year,
p38
aVyou'd need this much coal.
p39
aVThe bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,
p40
aVwe waste nine.
p41
aVThat means there's good news,
p42
aVbecause for every unit of energy we save,
p43
aVwe save the other nine.
p44
aVSo the question is, how can we get the people in this room
p45
aVand across the globe to start paying attention
p46
aVto the energy we're using,
p47
aVand start wasting less of it?
p48
aa(lp49
VThe answer comes from a behavioral science experiment
p50
aVthat was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,
p51
aVand only 90 miles from here,
p52
aVin San Marcos, California.
p53
aVGraduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,
p54
aVasking people to turn off their air conditioning
p55
aVand turn on their fans.
p56
aVOne quarter of the homes received a message that said,
p57
aVdid you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
p58
aVTurn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.
p59
aVAnother group got an environmental message.
p60
aVAnd still a third group got a message about
p61
aVbeing good citizens, preventing blackouts.
p62
aVMost people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.
p63
aVIn fact, none of these messages worked.
p64
aVThey had zero impact on energy consumption.
p65
aVIt was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut there was a fourth message,
p68
aVand this message simply said,
p69
aV"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors
p70
aVsaid that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.
p71
aVPlease join them. Turn off your air conditioning
p72
aVand turn on your fans."
p73
aVAnd wouldn't you know it, they did.
p74
aVThe people who received this message
p75
aVshowed a marked decrease in energy consumption
p76
aVsimply by being told what their neighbors were doing.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo what does this tell us?
p79
aVWell, if something is inconvenient,
p80
aVeven if we believe in it,
p81
aVmoral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us \u2014
p82
aVbut social pressure, that's powerful stuff.
p83
aVAnd harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.
p84
aVIn fact, it already is.
p85
aa(lp86
VInspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I
p87
aVstarted a company called Opower.
p88
aVWe built software and partnered with utility companies
p89
aVwho wanted to help their customers save energy.
p90
aVWe deliver personalized home energy reports
p91
aVthat show people how their consumption
p92
aVcompares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.
p93
aVJust like those effective door hangers,
p94
aVwe have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,
p95
aVand then we give everyone targeted recommendations
p96
aVto help them save.
p97
aVWe started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,
p98
aVweb, and now even a controllable thermostat,
p99
aVand for the last five years we've been running
p100
aVthe largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd it's working.
p103
aVOrdinary homeowners and renters have saved
p104
aVmore than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,
p105
aVand we're just getting started.
p106
aVThis year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities
p107
aVin six countries, we're going to generate
p108
aVanother two terawatt hours of electricity savings.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,
p111
aVbut for the rest of us, two terawatt hours
p112
aVis more than enough energy to power every home
p113
aVin St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined
p114
aVfor more than a year.
p115
aVTwo terawatt hours, it's roughly half
p116
aVwhat the U.S. solar industry produced last year.
p117
aVAnd two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,
p118
aVwe'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows
p119
aVevery minute around the clock every day for an entire year
p120
aVto get two terawatt hours of electricity.
p121
aVAnd we're not burning anything.
p122
aVWe're just motivating people to pay attention
p123
aVand change their behavior.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut we're just one company, and this is just
p126
aVscratching the surface.
p127
aVTwenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,
p128
aVand when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have
p129
aVinefficient lightbulbs. They may.
p130
aVI mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,
p131
aVand we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.
p132
aVThat's 40 billion dollars a year wasted
p133
aVon electricity that does not contribute to our well-being
p134
aVbut does contribute to climate change.
p135
aVThat's 40 billion \u2014 with a B \u2014
p136
aVevery year in the U.S. alone.
p137
aVThat's half our coal usage right there.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists
p140
aVare looking to replace coal with sustainable resources
p141
aVlike these,
p142
aVand this is both fantastic and essential.
p143
aVBut the most overlooked resource to get us
p144
aVto a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.
p145
aVIt's in this room. It's you, and it's me.
p146
aVAnd we can harness this resource
p147
aVwith no new material science
p148
aVsimply by applying behavioral science.
p149
aVWe can do it today, we know it works,
p150
aVand it will save us money right away.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo what are we waiting for?
p153
aVWell, in most places, utility regulation
p154
aVhasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
p155
aVUtilities are still rewarded when their customers
p156
aVwaste energy.
p157
aVThey ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut this story is much more than about household energy use.
p160
aVTake a look at the Prius.
p161
aVIt's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science
p162
aVbut because they invested in behavioral science.
p163
aVThe dashboard that shows drivers how much energy
p164
aVthey're saving in real time
p165
aVmakes former speed demons
p166
aVdrive more like cautious grandmothers.
p167
aa(lp168
VWhich brings us back to Harriet.
p169
aVWe met her on our first family vacation.
p170
aVShe came over to meet my young daughter,
p171
aVand she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name
p172
aVis also Harriet.
p173
aVShe asked me what I did for a living,
p174
aVand I told her, I work with utilities
p175
aVto help people save energy.
p176
aVIt was then that her eyes lit up.
p177
aa(lp178
VShe looked at me, and she said,
p179
aV"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.
p180
aVYou see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter
p181
aVin the mail from our utility.
p182
aVIt told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aV"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,
p185
aVtalk about, and even argue about,
p186
aVis what we should be doing to save energy.
p187
aVWe did everything that letter told us to do,
p188
aVand still I know there must be more.
p189
aVNow I'm here with a genuine expert.
p190
aVTell me. What should I do to save energy?"
p191
aa(lp192
VThere are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
p193
aVMy goal is to make sure
p194
aVwe are all asking it.
p195
aa(lp196
VThank you.
