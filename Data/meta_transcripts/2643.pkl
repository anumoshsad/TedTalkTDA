VI was a new mother
p4
aVand a young rabbi
p5
aVin the spring of 2004
p6
aVand the world was in shambles.
p7
aVMaybe you remember.
p8
aVEvery day, we heard devastating reports from the war in Iraq.
p9
aVThere were waves of terror rolling across the globe.
p10
aVIt seemed like humanity was spinning out of control.
p11
aVI remember the night that I read
p12
aVabout the series of coordinated bombings
p13
aVin the subway system in Madrid,
p14
aVand I got up and I walked over to the crib
p15
aVwhere my six-month-old baby girl
p16
aVlay sleeping sweetly,
p17
aVand I heard the rhythm of her breath,
p18
aVand I felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body.
p19
aVWe were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies,
p20
aVin politics, in religion, in populations.
p21
aVEverything felt so precarious.
p22
aVAnd I remember thinking,
p23
aV"My God, what kind of world did we bring this child into?
p24
aVAnd what was I as a mother and a religious leader
p25
aVwilling to do about it?
p26
aa(lp27
VOf course, I knew it was clear
p28
aVthat religion would be a principle battlefield
p29
aVin this rapidly changing landscape,
p30
aVand it was already clear
p31
aVthat religion was a significant part of the problem.
p32
aVThe question for me was,
p33
aVcould religion also be part of the solution?
p34
aVNow, throughout history,
p35
aVpeople have committed horrible crimes and atrocities
p36
aVin the name of religion.
p37
aVAnd as we entered the 21st century,
p38
aVit was very clear that religious extremism was once again on the rise.
p39
aVOur studies now show
p40
aVthat over the course of the past 15, 20 years,
p41
aVhostilities and religion-related violence
p42
aVhave been on the increase all over the world.
p43
aVBut we don't even need the studies to prove it,
p44
aVbecause I ask you, how many of us are surprised today
p45
aVwhen we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting,
p46
aVwhen we later find out that the last word that was uttered
p47
aVbefore the trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated
p48
aVis the name of God?
p49
aVIt barely raises an eyebrow today
p50
aVwhen we learn that yet another person
p51
aVhas decided to show his love of God
p52
aVby taking the lives of God's children.
p53
aVIn America, religious extremism
p54
aVlooks like a white, antiabortion Christian extremist
p55
aVwalking into Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs
p56
aVand murdering three people.
p57
aVIt also looks like a couple
p58
aVinspired by the Islamic State
p59
aVwalking into an office party in San Bernardino and killing 14.
p60
aVAnd even when religion-related extremism does not lead to violence,
p61
aVit is still used as a political wedge issue,
p62
aVcynically leading people to justify the subordination of women,
p63
aVthe stigmatization of LGBT people,
p64
aVracism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
p65
aVThis ought to concern deeply
p66
aVthose of us who care about the future of religion
p67
aVand the future of faith.
p68
aVWe need to call this what it is:
p69
aVa great failure of religion.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut the thing is, this isn't even the only challenge that religion faces today.
p72
aVAt the very same time
p73
aVthat we need religion to be a strong force against extremism,
p74
aVit is suffering from a second pernicious trend,
p75
aVwhat I call religious routine-ism.
p76
aVThis is when our institutions and our leaders
p77
aVare stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory,
p78
aVdevoid of life, devoid of vision
p79
aVand devoid of soul.
p80
aa(lp81
VLet me explain what I mean like this.
p82
aVOne of the great blessings of being a rabbi
p83
aVis standing under the chuppah, under the wedding canopy, with a couple,
p84
aVand helping them proclaim publicly
p85
aVand make holy the love that they found for one another.
p86
aVI want to ask you now, though,
p87
aVto think maybe from your own experience
p88
aVor maybe just imagine it
p89
aVabout the difference between the intensity of the experience
p90
aVunder the wedding canopy,
p91
aVand maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd if you're lucky enough to make it 16 or 17 years,
p96
aVif you're like most people, you probably wake up in the morning
p97
aVrealizing that you forgot to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant
p98
aVand you forgot so much as a card,
p99
aVand then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot.
p100
aa(lp101
VWell, religious ritual and rites
p102
aVwere essentially designed to serve the function of the anniversary,
p103
aVto be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants
p104
aVof that sacred, revelatory encounter
p105
aVthat birthed the religion in the first place.
p106
aVThe problem is that after a few centuries,
p107
aVthe date remains on the calendar,
p108
aVbut the love affair is long dead.
p109
aVThat's when we find ourselves in endless, mindless repetitions
p110
aVof words that don't mean anything to us,
p111
aVrising and being seated because someone has asked us to,
p112
aVholding onto jealously guarded doctrine
p113
aVthat's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality,
p114
aVengaging in perfunctory practice
p115
aVsimply because that's the way things have always been done.
p116
aa(lp117
VReligion is waning in the United States.
p118
aVAcross the board, churches and synagogues and mosques
p119
aVare all complaining
p120
aVabout how hard it is to maintain relevance
p121
aVfor a generation of young people who seem completely uninterested,
p122
aVnot only in the institutions that stand at the heart of our traditions
p123
aVbut even in religion itself.
p124
aVAnd what they need to understand
p125
aVis that there is today a generation of people
p126
aVwho are as disgusted by the violence of religious extremism
p127
aVas they are turned off
p128
aVby the lifelessness of religious routine-ism.
p129
aa(lp130
VOf course there is a bright spot to this story.
p131
aVGiven the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life,
p132
aVabout 12 or 13 years ago, I set out to try to determine
p133
aVif there was any way
p134
aVthat I could reclaim the heart of my own Jewish tradition,
p135
aVto help make it meaningful and purposeful again
p136
aVin a world on fire.
p137
aVI started to wonder,
p138
aVwhat if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation
p139
aVand think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again
p140
aVabout what the next iteration of religious life would look like?
p141
aVNow, we had no money, no space, no game plan,
p142
aVbut we did have email.
p143
aVSo my friend Melissa and I sat down and we wrote an email
p144
aVwhich we sent out to a few friends and colleagues.
p145
aVIt basically said this:
p146
aV"Before you bail on religion,
p147
aVwhy don't we come together this Friday night
p148
aVand see what we might make of our own Jewish inheritance?"
p149
aa(lp150
VWe hoped maybe 20 people would show up.
p151
aVIt turned out 135 people came.
p152
aVThey were cynics and seekers,
p153
aVatheists and rabbis.
p154
aVMany people said that night that it was the first time
p155
aVthat they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives.
p156
aVAnd so I set out to do the only rational thing
p157
aVthat someone would do in such a circumstance:
p158
aVI quit my job and tried to build this audacious dream,
p159
aVa reinvented, rethought religious life
p160
aVwhich we called "IKAR,"
p161
aVwhich means "the essence" or "the heart of the matter."
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, IKAR is not alone
p164
aVout there in the religious landscape today.
p165
aVThere are Jewish and Christian and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,
p166
aVmany of them women, by the way,
p167
aVwho have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions,
p168
aVwho firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution.
p169
aVWe are going back into our sacred traditions
p170
aVand recognizing that all of our traditions
p171
aVcontain the raw material to justify violence and extremism,
p172
aVand also contain the raw material to justify compassion,
p173
aVcoexistence and kindness \u2014
p174
aVthat when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance,
p175
aVwe can choose to read those same texts
p176
aVas directives for love and for forgiveness.
p177
aa(lp178
VI have found now
p179
aVin communities as varied as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts
p180
aVto a woman's mosque,
p181
aVto black churches in New York and in North Carolina,
p182
aVto a holy bus loaded with nuns
p183
aVthat traverses this country with a message of justice and peace,
p184
aVthat there is a shared religious ethos
p185
aVthat is now emerging in the form of revitalized religion in this country.
p186
aVAnd while the theologies and the practices vary very much
p187
aVbetween these independent communities,
p188
aVwhat we can see are some common, consistent threads between them.
p189
aa(lp190
VI'm going to share with you four of those commitments now.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe first is wakefulness.
p193
aVWe live in a time today
p194
aVin which we have unprecedented access
p195
aVto information about every global tragedy
p196
aVthat happens on every corner of this Earth.
p197
aVWithin 12 hours, 20 million people
p198
aVsaw that image of Aylan Kurdi's little body
p199
aVwashed up on the Turkish shore.
p200
aVWe all saw this picture.
p201
aVWe saw this picture of a five-year-old child
p202
aVpulled out of the rubble of his building in Aleppo.
p203
aVAnd once we see these images,
p204
aVwe are called to a certain kind of action.
p205
aa(lp206
VMy tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road
p207
aVwhen he sees a beautiful house on fire,
p208
aVand he says, "How can it be that something so beautiful would burn,
p209
aVand nobody seems to even care?"
p210
aVSo too we learn that our world is on fire,
p211
aVand it is our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open,
p212
aVand to recognize that it's our responsibility
p213
aVto help put out the flames.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis is extremely difficult to do.
p216
aVPsychologists tell us that the more we learn about what's broken in our world,
p217
aVthe less likely we are to do anything.
p218
aVIt's called psychic numbing.
p219
aVWe just shut down at a certain point.
p220
aVWell, somewhere along the way, our religious leaders forgot
p221
aVthat it's our job to make people uncomfortable.
p222
aVIt's our job to wake people up,
p223
aVto pull them out of their apathy
p224
aVand into the anguish,
p225
aVand to insist that we do what we don't want to do
p226
aVand see what we do not want to see.
p227
aVBecause we know that social change only happens \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
Vwhen we are awake enough to see that the house is on fire.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe second principle is hope,
p234
aVand I want to say this about hope.
p235
aVHope is not naive,
p236
aVand hope is not an opiate.
p237
aVHope may be the single greatest act of defiance
p238
aVagainst a politics of pessimism
p239
aVand against a culture of despair.
p240
aVBecause what hope does for us
p241
aVis it lifts us out of the container
p242
aVthat holds us and constrains us from the outside,
p243
aVand says, "You can dream and think expansively again.
p244
aVThat they cannot control in you."
p245
aa(lp246
VI saw hope made manifest in an African-American church
p247
aVin the South Side of Chicago this summer,
p248
aVwhere I brought my little girl,
p249
aVwho is now 13
p250
aVand a few inches taller than me,
p251
aVto hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.
p252
aVThat summer, there had already been 3,000 people shot
p253
aVbetween January and July in Chicago.
p254
aVWe went into that church and heard Rev. Moss preach,
p255
aVand after he did,
p256
aVthis choir of gorgeous women, 100 women strong,
p257
aVstood up and began to sing.
p258
aV"I need you. You need me.
p259
aVI love you. I need you to survive."
p260
aVAnd I realized in that moment
p261
aVthat this is what religion is supposed to be about.
p262
aVIt's supposed to be about giving people back a sense of purpose,
p263
aVa sense of hope,
p264
aVa sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world
p265
aVthat tells them that they don't matter at all.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe third principle is the principle of mightiness.
p268
aVThere's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around
p269
aVwith two slips of paper in our pockets.
p270
aVOne says, "I am but dust and ashes."
p271
aVIt's not all about me.
p272
aVI can't control everything, and I cannot do this on my own.
p273
aVThe other slip of paper says, "For my sake the world was created."
p274
aVWhich is to say it's true that I can't do everything,
p275
aVbut I can surely do something.
p276
aVI can forgive.
p277
aVI can love.
p278
aVI can show up.
p279
aVI can protest.
p280
aVI can be a part of this conversation.
p281
aVWe even now have a religious ritual,
p282
aVa posture,
p283
aVthat holds the paradox between powerlessness and power.
p284
aVIn the Jewish community,
p285
aVthe only time of year that we prostrate fully to the ground
p286
aVis during the high holy days.
p287
aVIt's a sign of total submission.
p288
aVNow in our community, when we get up off the ground,
p289
aVwe stand with our hands raised to the heavens,
p290
aVand we say, "I am strong, I am mighty, and I am worthy.
p291
aVI can't do everything, but I can do something."
p292
aa(lp293
VIn a world that conspires to make us believe that we are invisible
p294
aVand that we are impotent,
p295
aVreligious communities and religious ritual
p296
aVcan remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this Earth,
p297
aVwhatever gifts and blessings we were given,
p298
aVwhatever resources we have,
p299
aVwe can and we must use them
p300
aVto try to make the world a little bit more just
p301
aVand a little bit more loving.
p302
aa(lp303
VThe fourth and final is interconnectedness.
p304
aVA few years ago, there was a man walking on the beach in Alaska,
p305
aVwhen he came across a soccer ball
p306
aVthat had some Japanese letters written on it.
p307
aVHe took a picture of it and posted it up on social media,
p308
aVand a Japanese teenager contacted him.
p309
aVHe had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country,
p310
aVbut he was able to retrieve that soccer ball
p311
aVafter it had floated all the way across the Pacific.
p312
aVHow small our world has become.
p313
aVIt's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are
p314
aVas human beings.
p315
aVAnd yet, we know
p316
aVthat it is systems of oppression
p317
aVthat benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism.
p318
aa(lp319
VLet me tell you how this works.
p320
aVI'm not supposed to care
p321
aVwhen black youth are harassed by police,
p322
aVbecause my white-looking Jewish kids
p323
aVprobably won't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black.
p324
aVWell, not so, because this is also my problem.
p325
aVAnd guess what? Transphobia and Islamophobia
p326
aVand racism of all forms, those are also all of our problems.
p327
aVAnd so too is anti-Semitism all of our problems.
p328
aVBecause Emma Lazarus was right.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VEmma Lazarus was right when she said until all of us are free,
p333
aVwe are none of us free.
p334
aVWe are all in this together.
p335
aVAnd now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends,
p336
aVof wakefulness and hope and mightiness and interconnectedness,
p337
aVthere is a burgeoning, multifaith justice movement in this country
p338
aVthat is staking a claim on a countertrend,
p339
aVsaying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world.
p340
aa(lp341
VOur hearts hurt from the failed religion of extremism,
p342
aVand we deserve more than the failed religion of routine-ism.
p343
aVIt is time for religious leaders and religious communities
p344
aVto take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift
p345
aVthat this country and the world so desperately needs \u2014
p346
aVa shift toward love,
p347
aVtoward justice, toward equality and toward dignity for all.
p348
aVI believe that our children deserve no less than that.
p349
aa(lp350
VThank you.
