VThere's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once,
p4
aVthat one of the things that's contributed to homo sapiens' success
p5
aVas a species
p6
aVis our lack of body hair \u2014
p7
aVthat our hairlessness, our nakedness
p8
aVcombined with our invention of clothing,
p9
aVgives us the ability to modulate our body temperature
p10
aVand thus be able to survive in any climate we choose.
p11
aVAnd now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing.
p12
aVAnd it's more than just utility,
p13
aVnow it's a communication.
p14
aVEverything that we choose to put on is a narrative,
p15
aVa story about where we've been,
p16
aVwhat we're doing,
p17
aVwho we want to be.
p18
aa(lp19
VI was a lonely kid.
p20
aVI didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with,
p21
aVand I ended up making a lot of my own play.
p22
aVI made a lot of my own toys.
p23
aVIt began with ice cream.
p24
aVThere was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,
p25
aVand they served ice cream from behind the counter
p26
aVin these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs.
p27
aVAnd someone told me \u2014 I was eight years old \u2014
p28
aVsomeone told me that when they were done with those tubs,
p29
aVthey washed them out and kept them in the back,
p30
aVand if you asked they would give you one.
p31
aVIt took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage,
p32
aVbut I did, and they did.
p33
aVThey gave me one \u2014 I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub.
p34
aVI was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material \u2014
p35
aVmetal ring, top and bottom.
p36
aVI started turning it over in my head, and I realized, "Wait a minute \u2014
p37
aVmy head actually fits inside this thing."
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VYeah, I cut a hole out,
p42
aVI put some acetate in there
p43
aVand I made myself a space helmet.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VI needed a place to wear the space helmet,
p48
aVso I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home.
p49
aVI pushed it home,
p50
aVand in my parents' guest room closet,
p51
aVI turned it into a spaceship.
p52
aVI started with a control panel out of cardboard.
p53
aVI cut a hole for a radar screen
p54
aVand put a flashlight underneath it to light it.
p55
aVI put a view screen up, which I offset off the back wall \u2014
p56
aVand this is where I thought I was being really clever \u2014
p57
aVwithout permission, I painted the back wall of the closet black
p58
aVand put a star field,
p59
aVwhich I lit up with some Christmas lights I found in the attic,
p60
aVand I went on some space missions.
p61
aa(lp62
VA couple years later,
p63
aVthe movie "Jaws" came out.
p64
aVI was way too young to see it, but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,
p65
aVlike everyone else in America at the time.
p66
aVThere was a store in my town that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,
p67
aVand my mom must have overheard me talking to someone
p68
aVabout how awesome I thought this costume was,
p69
aVbecause a couple days before Halloween,
p70
aVshe blew my freaking mind by giving me this "Jaws" costume.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, I recognize it's a bit of a trope
p73
aVfor people of a certain age to complain
p74
aVthat kids these days have no idea how good they have it,
p75
aVbut let me just show you a random sampling
p76
aVof entry-level kids' costumes you can buy online right now ...
p77
aV... and this is the "Jaws" costume my mom bought for me.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VThis is a paper-thin shark face
p82
aVand a vinyl bib with the poster of "Jaws" on it.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd I loved it.
p87
aa(lp88
VA couple years later,
p89
aVmy dad took me to a film called "Excalibur."
p90
aVI actually got him to take me to it twice,
p91
aVwhich is no small thing, because it is a hard, R-rated film.
p92
aVBut it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs
p93
aVthat made me want to go see it again.
p94
aVThey helped \u2014
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VIt was the armor.
p99
aVThe armor in "Excalibur" was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.
p100
aVThese were literally knights in shining, mirror-polished armor.
p101
aVAnd moreover, the knights in "Excalibur" wear their armor everywhere.
p102
aVAll the time \u2014 they wear it at dinner, they wear it to bed.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VI was like, "Are they reading my mind?
p107
aVI want to wear armor all the time!"
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I went back to my favorite material,
p112
aVthe gateway drug for making,
p113
aVcorrugated cardboard,
p114
aVand I made myself a suit of armor,
p115
aVreplete with the neck shields and a white horse.
p116
aVNow that I've oversold it,
p117
aVhere's a picture of the armor that I made.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, this is only the first suit of armor I made
p124
aVinspired by "Excalibur."
p125
aVA couple of years later,
p126
aVI convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor.
p127
aVOver about a month,
p128
aVhe graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing
p129
aVand still, one of my all-time favorite attachment materials,
p130
aVPOP rivets.
p131
aVWe carefully, over that month,
p132
aVconstructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor
p133
aVwith compound curves.
p134
aVWe drilled holes in the helmet so that I could breathe,
p135
aVand I finished just in time for Halloween and wore it to school.
p136
aVNow, this is the one thing in this talk
p137
aVthat I don't have a slide to show you,
p138
aVbecause no photo exists of this armor.
p139
aVI did wear it to school,
p140
aVthere was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls,
p141
aVbut he never found me, for reasons that are about to become clear.
p142
aa(lp143
VThere were things I didn't anticipate
p144
aVabout wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school.
p145
aVIn third period math, I was standing in the back of class,
p146
aVand I'm standing in the back of class
p147
aVbecause the armor did not allow me to sit down.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is the first thing I didn't anticipate.
p152
aVAnd then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned
p153
aVabout halfway through the class and says, "Are you feeling OK?"
p154
aVI'm thinking, "Are you kidding? Am I feeling OK?
p155
aVI'm wearing a suit of armor! I am having the time of my \u2014"
p156
aVAnd I'm just about to tell her how great I feel,
p157
aVwhen the classroom starts to list to the left
p158
aVand disappear down this long tunnel,
p159
aVand then I woke up in the nurse's office.
p160
aVI had passed out from heat exhaustion,
p161
aVwearing the armor.
p162
aVAnd when I woke up,
p163
aVI wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class,
p164
aVI was wondering, "Who took my armor? Where's my armor?"
p165
aa(lp166
VOK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,
p167
aVsome colleagues and I get hired to make a show for Discovery Channel,
p168
aVcalled "MythBusters."
p169
aVAnd over 14 years,
p170
aVI learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies
p171
aVand how to tell stories about them for television.
p172
aVI also learn early on
p173
aVthat costuming can play a key role in this storytelling.
p174
aa(lp175
VI use costumes to add humor, comedy, color
p176
aVand narrative clarity to the stories we're telling.
p177
aVAnd then we do an episode called "Dumpster Diving,"
p178
aVand I learn a little bit more
p179
aVabout the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.
p180
aVIn the episode "Dumpster Diving,"
p181
aVthe question we were trying to answer is:
p182
aVIs jumping into a dumpster as safe
p183
aVas the movies would lead you to believe?
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VThe episode was going to have two distinct parts to it.
p188
aVOne was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman
p189
aVinto an air bag.
p190
aVAnd the second was the graduation to the experiment:
p191
aVwe'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it.
p192
aVI wanted to visually separate these two elements,
p193
aVand I thought,
p194
aV"Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits \u2014
p195
aVOh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits.
p196
aVThat's for the training."
p197
aVBut for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking \u2014
p198
aV"I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VSo I went to Haight Street.
p203
aVI bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots.
p204
aVI found a long, flowing coat on eBay.
p205
aVI got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear.
p206
aVThe day of the experiment shoot comes up,
p207
aVand I step out of my car in this costume,
p208
aVand my crew takes a look at me ...
p209
aVand start suppressing their church giggles.
p210
aVThey're like, "(Laugh sound)."
p211
aVAnd I feel two distinct things at this moment.
p212
aVI feel total embarrassment
p213
aVover the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew
p214
aVthat I'm completely into wearing this costume.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VBut the producer in my mind reminds myself
p219
aVthat in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,
p220
aVthat flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VFive years into the "MythBusters" run,
p225
aVwe got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con.
p226
aVI'd known about Comic-Con for years and never had time to go.
p227
aVThis was the big leagues \u2014 this was costuming mecca.
p228
aVPeople fly in from all over the world
p229
aVto show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego.
p230
aVAnd I wanted to participate.
p231
aVI decided that I would put together an elaborate costume
p232
aVthat covered me completely,
p233
aVand I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.
p234
aVThe costume I chose?
p235
aVHellboy.
p236
aVThat's not my costume,
p237
aVthat's actually Hellboy.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VBut I spent months
p242
aVassembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could,
p243
aVfrom the boots to the belt to the pants
p244
aVto the right hand of doom.
p245
aVI found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest
p246
aVand I put them on.
p247
aVI even had contact lenses made in my prescription.
p248
aVI wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con
p249
aVand I can't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VSweating! I should've remembered this.
p254
aVI'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,
p255
aVand none of it matters because I'm totally in love.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VNot just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor,
p260
aVbut also with the community of other costumers.
p261
aVIt's not called costuming at Cons,
p262
aVit's called "cosplay."
p263
aVNow ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up
p264
aVas their favorite characters from film and television
p265
aVand especially anime,
p266
aVbut it is so much more than that.
p267
aVThese aren't just people who find a costume and put it on \u2014
p268
aVthey mash them up.
p269
aVThey bend them to their will.
p270
aVThey change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions.
p271
aVThey're super clever and genius.
p272
aVThey let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VBut more than that,
p277
aVthey rehearse their costumes.
p278
aVAt Comic-Con or any other Con,
p279
aVyou don't just take pictures of people walking around.
p280
aVYou go up and say,
p281
aV"Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?"
p282
aVAnd then you give them time to get into their pose.
p283
aVThey've worked hard on their pose
p284
aVto make their costume look great for your camera.
p285
aVAnd it's so beautiful to watch.
p286
aVAnd I take this to heart.
p287
aVAt subsequent Cons,
p288
aVI learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."
p289
aVI learn how to be a scary Ringwraith from "Lord of the Rings,"
p290
aVand I actually frighten some children.
p291
aVI learned that "hrr hrr hrr" \u2014
p292
aVthat head laugh that Chewbacca does.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd then I dressed up as No-Face from "Spirited Away."
p295
aVIf you don't know about "Spirited Away" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,
p296
aVfirst of all, you're welcome.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VThis is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films.
p301
aVIt's about a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in the spirit world
p302
aVin an abandoned Japanese theme park.
p303
aVAnd she finds her way back out again
p304
aVwith the help of a couple of friends she makes \u2014
p305
aVa captured dragon named Haku
p306
aVand a lonely demon named No-Face.
p307
aVNo-Face is lonely and he wants to make friends,
p308
aVand he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him
p309
aVand producing gold in his hand.
p310
aVBut this doesn't go very well,
p311
aVand so he ends up going on kind of a rampage
p312
aVuntil Chihiro saves him,
p313
aVrescues him.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo I put together a No-Face costume,
p316
aVand I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.
p317
aVAnd I very carefully practiced No-Face's gestures.
p318
aVI resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.
p319
aVWhen people asked to take my picture,
p320
aVI would nod
p321
aVand I would shyly stand next to them.
p322
aVThey would take the picture
p323
aVand then I would secret out from behind my robe
p324
aVa chocolate gold coin.
p325
aVAnd at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them.
p326
aVAh, ah ah! \u2014 like that.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd people were freaking out.
p329
aV"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! Oh my god, this is so cool!"
p330
aVAnd I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic.
p331
aVAnd about 15 minutes in something happens.
p332
aVSomebody grabs my hand,
p333
aVand they put a coin back into it.
p334
aVAnd I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift,
p335
aVbut no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away.
p336
aVI don't know why.
p337
aVAnd I keep on going, I take some more pictures.
p338
aVAnd then it happens again.
p339
aVUnderstand, I can't see anything inside this costume.
p340
aVI can see through the mouth \u2014
p341
aVI can see people's shoes.
p342
aVI can hear what they're saying and I can see their feet.
p343
aVBut the third time someone gives me back a coin,
p344
aVI want to know what's going on.
p345
aVSo I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view,
p346
aVand what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.
p347
aVAnd then it hits me:
p348
aVit's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.
p349
aVIn the film "Spirited Away,"
p350
aVbad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face.
p351
aa(lp352
VThis isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay.
p353
aVWe are, all of us on that floor,
p354
aVinjecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us.
p355
aVAnd we're making it our own.
p356
aVWe're connecting with something important inside of us.
p357
aVAnd the costumes are how we reveal ourselves
p358
aVto each other.
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you.
