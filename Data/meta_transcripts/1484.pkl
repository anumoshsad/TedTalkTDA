VAbout 75 years ago,
p4
aVmy grandfather, a young man,
p5
aVwalked into a tent
p6
aVthat was converted into a
p7
aVmovie theater like that,
p8
aVand he fell hopelessly in love
p9
aVwith the woman he saw on the
p10
aVsilver screen: none other than Mae West,
p11
aVthe heartthrob of the '30s,
p12
aVand he could never forget her.
p13
aVIn fact, when he had his daughter
p14
aVmany years later, he wanted to
p15
aVname her after Mae West,
p16
aVbut can you imagine an Indian
p17
aVchild name Mae West?
p18
aVThe Indian family said, no way!
p19
aa(lp20
VSo when my twin brother Kaesava
p21
aVwas born, he decided to tinker
p22
aVwith the spelling of Keshava's name.
p23
aVHe said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,
p24
aVwhy can't Keshava be K-A-E?
p25
aVSo he changed Kaesava's spelling.
p26
aVNow Kaesava had a baby boy
p27
aVcalled Rehan a couple of weeks ago.
p28
aVHe decided to spell, or, rather,
p29
aVmisspell Raehan with an A-E.
p30
aa(lp31
VYou know, my grandfather died
p32
aVmany years ago when I was
p33
aVlittle, but his love for Mae
p34
aVWest lives on as a misspelling
p35
aVin the DNA of his progeny.
p36
aVThat for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)
p37
aa(lp38
VYou know, as for me,
p39
aVmy wife and I have our own
p40
aVcrazy legacy project.
p41
aVWe actually sit every few years,
p42
aVargue, disagree, fight,
p43
aVand actually come up with our
p44
aVvery own 200-year plan.
p45
aa(lp46
VOur friends think we're mad.
p47
aVOur parents think we're cuckoo.
p48
aVBecause, you know, we both
p49
aVcome from families that really
p50
aVlook up to humility and wisdom,
p51
aVbut we both like to live
p52
aVlarger than life.
p53
aVI believe in the concept of
p54
aVa Raja Yogi: Be a dude before
p55
aVyou can become an ascetic.
p56
aVThis is me being a rock star,
p57
aVeven if it's in my own house.
p58
aVYou know?
p59
aa(lp60
VSo when Netra and I sat down
p61
aVto make our first plan
p62
aV10 years ago, we said
p63
aVwe want the focus of this plan
p64
aVto go way beyond ourselves.
p65
aVWhat do we mean by beyond ourselves?
p66
aa(lp67
VWell 200 years, we calculated,
p68
aVis at the end of our direct
p69
aVcontact with the world.
p70
aVThere's nobody I'll meet in
p71
aVmy life will ever live beyond
p72
aV200 years, so we thought
p73
aVthat's a perfect place where
p74
aVwe should situate our plan and
p75
aVlet our imagination take flight.
p76
aa(lp77
VYou know, I never really
p78
aVbelieved in legacy. What am I
p79
aVgoing to leave behind? I'm an artist.
p80
aVUntil I made a cartoon about 9/11.
p81
aVIt caused so much trouble for me.
p82
aVI was so upset.
p83
aVYou know, a cartoon that was
p84
aVmeant to be a cartoon of the week
p85
aVended up staying so much longer.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow I'm in the business of
p88
aVcreating art that will
p89
aVdefinitely even outlive me, and
p90
aVI think about what I want to
p91
aVleave behind through those paintings.
p92
aa(lp93
VYou know, the 9/11 cartoon
p94
aVupset me so much that I decided
p95
aVI'll never cartoon again.
p96
aVI said, I'm never going to make any
p97
aVhonest public commentary again.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut of course I continued
p100
aVcreating artwork that was honest
p101
aVand raw, because I forgot about
p102
aVhow people reacted to my work.
p103
aa(lp104
VYou know, sometimes forgetting
p105
aVis so important to remain idealistic.
p106
aVPerhaps loss of memory is so
p107
aVcrucial for our survival
p108
aVas human beings.
p109
aa(lp110
VOne of the most important things
p111
aVin my 200-year plan that Netra
p112
aVand I write is what to forget
p113
aVabout ourselves.
p114
aVYou know, we carry so much
p115
aVbaggage, from our parents,
p116
aVfrom our society, from so many
p117
aVpeople \u2014 fears, insecurities \u2014 and
p118
aVour 200-year plan really lists
p119
aVall our childhood problems that we have to expire.
p120
aVWe actually put an expiry date
p121
aVon all our childhood problems.
p122
aVThe latest date I put was,
p123
aVI said, I am going to expire
p124
aVmy fear of my leftist, feminist
p125
aVmother-in-law, and this
p126
aVtoday is the date! (Laughs)
p127
aVShe's watching. (Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnyway, you know, I really
p130
aVmake decisions all the time
p131
aVabout how I want to remember
p132
aVmyself, and that's the most important
p133
aVkind of decisions I make.
p134
aVAnd this directly translates
p135
aVinto my paintings.
p136
aVBut like my friends, I can do
p137
aVthat really well on Facebook,
p138
aVPinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.
p139
aVName it, I'm on it.
p140
aVI've started outsourcing my
p141
aVmemory to the digital world,
p142
aVyou know? But that comes
p143
aVwith a problem.
p144
aVIt's so easy to think of
p145
aVtechnology as a metaphor
p146
aVfor memory, but our brains
p147
aVare not perfect storage devices
p148
aVlike technology.
p149
aVWe only remember what we
p150
aVwant to. At least I do.
p151
aVAnd I rather think of our brains
p152
aVas biased curators of our
p153
aVmemory, you know? And if
p154
aVtechnology is not a metaphor for
p155
aVmemory, what is it?
p156
aa(lp157
VNetra and I use our technology
p158
aVas a tool in our 200-year plan
p159
aVto really curate our digital legacy.
p160
aa(lp161
VThat is a picture of my mother,
p162
aVand she recently got a Facebook account.
p163
aVYou know where this is going.
p164
aVAnd I've been very supportive
p165
aVuntil this picture shows up
p166
aVon my Facebook page. (Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I actually untagged myself
p169
aVfirst, then I picked up the
p170
aVphone. I said, "Mom, you will
p171
aVnever put a picture of me
p172
aVin a bikini ever again."
p173
aVAnd she said, "Why? You look
p174
aVso cute, darling." I said,
p175
aV"You just don't understand."
p176
aa(lp177
VMaybe we are among the first
p178
aVgeneration that really understands
p179
aVthis digital curating of ourselves.
p180
aVMaybe we are the first to even
p181
aVactively record our lives.
p182
aa(lp183
VYou know, whether you
p184
aVagree with, you know, legacy
p185
aVor not, we are actually leaving
p186
aVbehind digital traces all the time.
p187
aVSo Netra and I really wanted
p188
aVto use our 200-year plan
p189
aVto curate this digital legacy,
p190
aVand not only digital legacy
p191
aVbut we believe in curating
p192
aVthe legacy of my past
p193
aVand future.
p194
aa(lp195
VHow, you may ask?
p196
aa(lp197
VWell, when I think of the future,
p198
aVI never see myself moving forward
p199
aVin time. I actually see time
p200
aVmoving backward towards me.
p201
aVI can actually visualize
p202
aVmy future approaching.
p203
aVI can dodge what I don't want
p204
aVand pull in what I want.
p205
aVIt's like a video game obstacle
p206
aVcourse. And I've gotten better and better
p207
aVat doing this. Even when I make
p208
aVa painting, I actually imagine
p209
aVI'm behind the painting,
p210
aVit already exists, and
p211
aVsomeone's looking at it,
p212
aVand I see whether they're
p213
aVfeeling it from their gut.
p214
aVAre they feeling it from their
p215
aVheart, or is it just a cerebral thing?
p216
aVAnd it really informs my painting.
p217
aVEven when I do an art show,
p218
aVI really think about, what should
p219
aVpeople walk away with?
p220
aa(lp221
VI remember when I was 19,
p222
aVI did, I wanted to do my first
p223
aVart exhibition, and I wanted the
p224
aVwhole world to know about it.
p225
aVI didn't know TED then,
p226
aVbut what I did was I closed
p227
aVmy eyes tight, and I started
p228
aVdreaming. I could imagine people
p229
aVcoming in, dressed up, looking
p230
aVbeautiful, my paintings with all
p231
aVthe light, and in my visualization
p232
aVI actually saw a very famous
p233
aVactress launching my show,
p234
aVgiving credibility to me.
p235
aVAnd I woke up from my
p236
aVvisualization and I said,
p237
aVwho was that? I couldn't tell
p238
aVif it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,
p239
aVtwo very famous Indian actresses,
p240
aVlike the Meryl Streeps of India.
p241
aa(lp242
VAs it turned out, next morning
p243
aVI wrote a letter to both of them,
p244
aVand Shabana Azmi replied,
p245
aVand came and launched
p246
aVmy very first show 12 years ago.
p247
aVAnd what a bang it started
p248
aVmy career with! You know,
p249
aVwhen we think of time in this
p250
aVway, we can curate not only the
p251
aVfuture but also the past.
p252
aVThis is a picture of my family,
p253
aVand that is Netra, my wife.
p254
aVShe's the co-creator of my
p255
aV200-year plan.
p256
aa(lp257
VNetra's a high school history
p258
aVteacher. I love Netra,
p259
aVbut I hate history.
p260
aVI keep saying, "Nets, you live
p261
aVin the past while I'll create
p262
aVthe future, and when I'm done,
p263
aVyou can study about it."
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VShe gave me an indulgent smile,
p267
aVand as punishment, she said,
p268
aV"Tomorrow I'm teaching a class
p269
aVon Indian history, and you are
p270
aVsitting in it, and I'm grading you."
p271
aa(lp272
VI'm like, "Oh, God." I went.
p273
aa(lp274
VI actually went and sat in
p275
aVon her class. She started by
p276
aVgiving students primary source
p277
aVdocuments from India, Pakistan,
p278
aVfrom Britain, and I said,
p279
aV"Wow." Then she asked them to
p280
aVseparate fact from bias.
p281
aVI said, "Wow," again.
p282
aVThen she said, "Choose your
p283
aVfacts and biases and create an
p284
aVimage of your own story
p285
aVof dignity."
p286
aa(lp287
VHistory as an imaging tool?
p288
aVI was so inspired.
p289
aa(lp290
VI went and created my own
p291
aVversion of Indian history.
p292
aVI actually included stories from
p293
aVmy grandmother.
p294
aVShe used to work for the
p295
aVtelephone exchange, and she used
p296
aVto actually overhear conversations
p297
aVbetween Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.
p298
aVAnd she used to hear all
p299
aVkinds of things she shouldn't
p300
aVhave heard. But, you know,
p301
aVI include things like that.
p302
aVThis is my version of Indian history.
p303
aa(lp304
VYou know, if this
p305
aVis so, it occurred to me that
p306
aVmaybe, just maybe, the primary
p307
aVobjective of our brains
p308
aVis to serve our dignity.
p309
aVGo tell Facebook to
p310
aVfigure that out!
p311
aa(lp312
VNetra and I don't write our
p313
aV200-year plan for someone else
p314
aVto come and execute it
p315
aVin 150 years. Imagine receiving
p316
aVa parcel saying, from the past,
p317
aVokay now you're supposed to
p318
aVspend the rest of your life
p319
aVdoing all of this. No.
p320
aVWe actually write it only
p321
aVto set our attitudes right.
p322
aa(lp323
VYou know, I used to believe
p324
aVthat education is the most
p325
aVimportant tool to leave
p326
aVa meaningful legacy.
p327
aVEducation is great.
p328
aVIt really teaches us who
p329
aVwe are, and helps us
p330
aVcontextualize ourselves
p331
aVin the world, but it's really
p332
aVmy creativity that's taught me
p333
aVthat I can be much more
p334
aVthan what my education told me I am.
p335
aa(lp336
VI'd like to make
p337
aVthe argument that creativity is
p338
aVthe most important tool we have.
p339
aVIt lets us create who we are,
p340
aVand curate what is to come.
p341
aa(lp342
VI like to think \u2014 Thank you.
p343
aa(lp344
VI like to think of myself
p345
aVas a storyteller, where my past
p346
aVand my future are only stories,
p347
aVmy stories, waiting to be told
p348
aVand retold. I hope all of you
p349
aVone day get a chance to
p350
aVshare and write your own
p351
aV200-year story.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you so much.
p354
aa(lp355
VShukran! (Applause)
