VWhen someone mentions Cuba,
p4
aVwhat do you think about?
p5
aVClassic, classic cars?
p6
aVPerhaps good cigars?
p7
aVMaybe you think of a famous baseball player.
p8
aVWhat about when somebody mentions North Korea?
p9
aVYou think about those missile tests,
p10
aVmaybe their notorious leader
p11
aVor his good friend, Dennis Rodman.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VOne thing that likely doesn't come to mind
p16
aVis a vision of a country,
p17
aVan open economy,
p18
aVwhose citizens have access to a wide range of affordable consumer products.
p19
aa(lp20
VI'm not here to argue how these countries got to where they are today.
p21
aVI simply want to use them as an example of countries and citizens
p22
aVwho have been affected, negatively affected,
p23
aVby a trade policy that restricts imports
p24
aVand protects local industries.
p25
aVRecently we've heard a number of countries
p26
aVtalk about restricting imports
p27
aVand protecting their local, domestic industries.
p28
aVNow, this may sound fine in a sound bite,
p29
aVbut what it really is is protectionism.
p30
aVWe heard a lot about this during the 2016 presidential election.
p31
aVWe heard about it during the Brexit debates
p32
aVand most recently during the French elections.
p33
aVIn fact, it's been a really important topic
p34
aVbeing talked about around the world,
p35
aVand many aspiring political leaders
p36
aVare running on platforms positioning protectionism as a good thing.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, I could see why they think protectionism is good,
p39
aVbecause sometimes it seems like trade is unfair.
p40
aVSome have blamed trade
p41
aVfor some of the problems we've been having here at home in the US.
p42
aVFor years we've been hearing
p43
aVabout the loss of high-paying US manufacturing jobs.
p44
aVMany think that manufacturing is declining in the US
p45
aVbecause companies are moving their operations offshore
p46
aVto markets with lower-cost labor
p47
aVlike China, Mexico and Vietnam.
p48
aVThey also think trade agreements sometimes are unfair,
p49
aVlike NAFTA
p50
aVand the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
p51
aVbecause these trade agreements allow companies
p52
aVto reimport those cheaply produced goods back into the US
p53
aVand other countries from where the jobs were taken.
p54
aVSo it kind of feels like the exporters win
p55
aVand the importers lose.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, the reality is
p58
aVoutput in the manufacturing sector in the US
p59
aVis actually growing,
p60
aVbut we are losing jobs.
p61
aVWe're losing lots of them.
p62
aVIn fact, from 2000 to 2010,
p63
aV5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.
p64
aVBut they're not being lost for the reasons you might think.
p65
aVMike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio
p66
aVdidn't lose his jobs at the factory
p67
aVto Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.
p68
aVNo.
p69
aVMike lost his job to a machine.
p70
aV87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs
p71
aVhave been eliminated because we've made improvements
p72
aVin our own productivity through automation.
p73
aVSo that means that one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs
p74
aVwas due to offshoring.
p75
aVNow, this is not just a US phenomenon.
p76
aVNo.
p77
aVIn fact, automation is spreading to every production line
p78
aVin every country around the world.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut look, I get it:
p81
aVif you just lost your job
p82
aVand then you read in the newspaper
p83
aVthat your old company just struck up a deal with China,
p84
aVit's easy to think you were just replaced
p85
aVin a one-for-one deal.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhen I hear stories like this, I think that what people picture
p88
aVis that trade happens between only two countries.
p89
aVManufacturers in one country
p90
aVproduce products and they export them
p91
aVto consumers in other countries,
p92
aVand it feels like the manufacturing countries win
p93
aVand the importing countries lose.
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, reality's a little bit different.
p96
aVI'm a supply chain professional,
p97
aVand I live and work in Mexico.
p98
aVAnd I work in the middle
p99
aVof a highly connected network of manufacturers
p100
aVall collaborating from around the world
p101
aVto produce many of the products we use today.
p102
aVWhat I see
p103
aVfrom my front-row seat in Mexico City
p104
aVactually looks more like this.
p105
aVAnd this is a more accurate depiction of what trade really looks like.
p106
aVI've had the pleasure of being able to see
p107
aVhow many different products are manufactured,
p108
aVfrom golf clubs to laptop computers
p109
aVto internet servers, automobiles
p110
aVand even airplanes.
p111
aVAnd believe me, none of it happens in a straight line.
p112
aa(lp113
VLet me give you an example.
p114
aVA few months ago, I was touring the manufacturing plant
p115
aVof a multinational aerospace company
p116
aVin Querétaro, Mexico,
p117
aVand the VP of logistics points out a completed tail assembly.
p118
aVIt turns out the tail assemblies are assembled from panels
p119
aVthat are manufactured in France,
p120
aVand they're assembled in Mexico
p121
aVusing components imported from the US.
p122
aVWhen those tail assemblies are done,
p123
aVthey're exported via truck to Canada
p124
aVto their primary assembly plant
p125
aVwhere they come together
p126
aVwith thousands of other parts,
p127
aVlike the wings and the seats
p128
aVand the little shades over the little windows,
p129
aVall coming in to become a part of a new airplane.
p130
aVThink about it.
p131
aVThese new airplanes,
p132
aVbefore they even take their first flight,
p133
aVthey have more stamps in their passports
p134
aVthan Angelina Jolie.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, this approach to processing goes on all around the world
p137
aVto manufacture many of the products
p138
aVwe use every day,
p139
aVfrom skin cream to airplanes.
p140
aVWhen you go home tonight, take a look in your house.
p141
aVYou might be surprised to find a label that looks like this one:
p142
aV"Manufactured in the USA from US and foreign parts."
p143
aa(lp144
VEconomist Michael Porter
p145
aVdescribed what's going on here best.
p146
aVMany decades ago, he said that it's most beneficial for a country
p147
aVto focus on producing the products it can produce most efficiently
p148
aVand trading for the rest.
p149
aVSo what he's talking about here is shared production,
p150
aVand efficiency is the name of the game.
p151
aVYou've probably seen an example of this
p152
aVat home or at work.
p153
aa(lp154
VLet's take a look at an example.
p155
aVThink about how your house was built
p156
aVor your kitchen renovated.
p157
aVTypically, there's a general contractor
p158
aVwho is responsible for coordinating the efforts
p159
aVof all the different contractors:
p160
aVan architect to draw the plans,
p161
aVan earth-moving company to dig the foundation,
p162
aVa plumber, a carpenter and so on.
p163
aVSo why doesn't the general contractor
p164
aVpick just one company
p165
aVto do all the work,
p166
aVlike, say, the architect?
p167
aVBecause this is silly.
p168
aVThe general contractor selects experts
p169
aVbecause it takes years
p170
aVto learn and master
p171
aVhow to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house or renovate a kitchen,
p172
aVsome of them requiring special training.
p173
aVThink about it:
p174
aVWould you want your architect to install your toilet?
p175
aVOf course not.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo let's apply this process to the corporate world.
p178
aVCompanies today focus on manufacturing
p179
aVwhat they produce best and most efficiently,
p180
aVand they trade for everything else.
p181
aVSo this means they rely
p182
aVon a global, interconnected, interdependent network of manufacturers
p183
aVto produce these products.
p184
aVIn fact, that network is so interconnected
p185
aVit's almost impossible
p186
aVto dismantle and produce products in just one country.
p187
aa(lp188
VLet's take a look at the interconnected web
p189
aVwe saw a few moments ago,
p190
aVand let's focus on just one strand
p191
aVbetween the US and Mexico.
p192
aVThe Wilson Institute says that shared production represents
p193
aV40 percent of the half a trillion dollars in trade between the US and Mexico.
p194
aVThat's about 200 billion dollars,
p195
aVor the same as the GDP for Portugal.
p196
aVSo let's just imagine
p197
aVthat the US decides to impose
p198
aVa 20 percent border tax on all imports from Mexico.
p199
aVOK, fine.
p200
aVBut do you think Mexico is just going to stand by and let that happen?
p201
aVNo. No way.
p202
aVSo in retaliation, they impose a similar tax
p203
aVon all goods being imported from the US,
p204
aVand a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,
p205
aVand 20 percent \u2014 just imagine that 20 percent duties
p206
aVare added to every good, product, product component
p207
aVcrossing back and forth across the border,
p208
aVand you could be looking at more than a 40 percent increase in duties,
p209
aVor 80 billion dollars.
p210
aVNow, don't kid yourself,
p211
aVthese costs are going to be passed along
p212
aVto you and to me.
p213
aVNow, let's think about what impact that might have on some of the products,
p214
aVor the prices of the products, that we buy every day.
p215
aVSo if a 30 percent increase in duties were actually passed along,
p216
aVwe would be looking at some pretty important increases in prices.
p217
aVA Lincoln MKZ would go from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.
p218
aVAnd the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV
p219
aVwould go from 898 dollars to 1,167 dollars.
p220
aVAnd the price of a 16-ounce jar of CVS skin moisturizer
p221
aVwould go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
p222
aVNow, remember, this is only looking at one strand of the production chain
p223
aVbetween the US and Mexico,
p224
aVso multiply this out across all of the strands.
p225
aVThe impact could be considerable.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, just think about this:
p228
aVeven if we were able to dismantle this network
p229
aVand produce products in just one country,
p230
aVwhich by the way is easier said than done,
p231
aVwe would still only be saving or protecting
p232
aVone out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.
p233
aVThat's right, because remember,
p234
aVmost of those jobs, 87 percent,
p235
aVwere lost due to improvements in our own productivity.
p236
aVAnd unfortunately, those jobs, they're gone for good.
p237
aVSo the real question is,
p238
aVdoes it make sense for us to drive up prices
p239
aVto the point where many of us can't afford the basic goods we use every day
p240
aVfor the purpose of saving a job
p241
aVthat might be eliminated in a couple of years anyway?
p242
aa(lp243
VThe reality is that shared production
p244
aVallows us to manufacture higher quality products
p245
aVat lower costs.
p246
aVIt's that simple.
p247
aVIt allows us to get more
p248
aVout of the limited resources and expertise we have
p249
aVand at the same time benefit from lower prices.
p250
aVIt's really important to remember
p251
aVthat for shared production to be effective,
p252
aVit relies on efficient cross-border movement of raw materials,
p253
aVcomponents and finished products.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo remember this:
p256
aVthe next time you're hearing somebody try to sell you on the idea
p257
aVthat protectionism is a good deal,
p258
aVit's just not.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.
