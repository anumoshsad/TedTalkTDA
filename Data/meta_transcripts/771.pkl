VI've always been interested in
p4
aVthe relationship of formal structures and human behavior.
p5
aVIf you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.
p6
aVWell, law is also a powerful driver
p7
aVof human behavior.
p8
aVAnd what I'd like to discuss today
p9
aVis the need to overhaul and simplify the law
p10
aVto release the energy and passion
p11
aVof Americans, so that we can begin
p12
aVto address the challenges of our society.
p13
aa(lp14
VYou might have noticed that law has grown
p15
aVprogressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.
p16
aVIf you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything
p17
aVwithout calling your general counsel.
p18
aVIndeed, there is this phenomenon now
p19
aVwhere the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.
p20
aVIt's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.
p21
aVYou need a lawyer to run the company,
p22
aVbecause there's so much law.
p23
aVBut it's not just business that's affected by this,
p24
aVit's actually pressed down into the daily activities
p25
aVof ordinary people.
p26
aa(lp27
VA couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.
p28
aVIt was in a grizzly bear preserve,
p29
aValthough no one told me that before we went.
p30
aVAnd our guide was a local science teacher.
p31
aVShe was wholly unconcerned about the bears,
p32
aVbut she was terrified of lawyers.
p33
aVThe stories started pouring out.
p34
aVShe'd just been involved in an episode where a parent
p35
aVhad threatened to sue the school
p36
aVbecause she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent
p37
aVwhen he turned the paper in late.
p38
aVThe principal didn't want to stand up to the parent
p39
aVbecause he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.
p40
aVSo, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made
p41
aVover and over again.
p42
aVAfter 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated
p43
aVand raised the grade.
p44
aVShe said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."
p45
aa(lp46
VAbout the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference
p47
aVin Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,
p48
aVand she was going to drive them in her car,
p49
aVbut the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car
p50
aVfor liability reasons.
p51
aVYou have to go in a school bus."
p52
aVSo, they provided a bus that held 60 people
p53
aVand drove the three of them back and forth
p54
aVseveral hours to Laramie.
p55
aa(lp56
VHer husband is also a science teacher,
p57
aVand he takes his biology class on a hike
p58
aVin the nearby national park.
p59
aVBut he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year
p60
aVbecause one of the students in the class was disabled,
p61
aVso the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.
p62
aVAt the end of this day I could have filled a book
p63
aVjust with stories about law
p64
aVfrom this one teacher.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, we've been taught to believe that law
p67
aVis the foundation of freedom.
p68
aVBut somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,
p69
aVthe land of the free has become a legal minefield.
p70
aVIt's really changed our lives in ways
p71
aVthat are sort of imperceptible;
p72
aVand yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.
p73
aVIt's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a
p74
aVpediatrician friend
p75
aVin North Carolina. He said,
p76
aV"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.
p77
aVYou wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff
p78
aVthat might be used against you."
p79
aVThis is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.
p80
aVMy own law firm has a list of questions
p81
aVthat I'm not allowed to ask
p82
aVwhen interviewing candidates,
p83
aVsuch as the sinister question,
p84
aVbulging with hidden motives and innuendo,
p85
aV"Where are you from?"
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VNow for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm
p89
aVthat lawsuits are out of control.
p90
aVAnd we read every once in while
p91
aVabout these crazy lawsuits, like the guy
p92
aVin the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars
p93
aVbecause they lost his pair of pants.
p94
aVThe case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut the reality is, these crazy cases
p97
aVare relatively rare. They don't usually win.
p98
aVAnd the total of direct tort cost
p99
aVin this country is about two percent,
p100
aVwhich is twice as much as in other countries
p101
aVbut, as taxes go, hardly crippling.
p102
aVBut the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhat's happened here, again,
p105
aValmost without our knowing,
p106
aVis our culture has changed.
p107
aVPeople no longer feel free
p108
aVto act on their best judgment.
p109
aVSo, what do we do about it?
p110
aVWe certainly don't want to give up the rights,
p111
aVwhen people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.
p112
aVWe need regulation to make sure
p113
aVpeople don't pollute and such.
p114
aVWe lack even a vocabulary to deal with
p115
aVthis problem,
p116
aVand that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.
p117
aa(lp118
VWe've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,
p119
aVevery issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.
p120
aVAnd so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.
p121
aVIs it possible that there are extenuating circumstances
p122
aVthat explain why Johnny
p123
aVturned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?
p124
aVIs it possible that the doctor
p125
aVmight have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?
p126
aVAnd of course the hindsight bias is perfect.
p127
aVThere's always a different scenario that you can sketch out
p128
aVwhere it's possible that something could have been done differently.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,
p131
aVhoping that we can judge any dispute
p132
aVagainst the standard of a perfect society,
p133
aVwhere everyone will agree what's fair,
p134
aVand where accidents will be extinct,
p135
aVrisk will be no more.
p136
aVOf course, this is Utopia;
p137
aVit's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.
p138
aVIt's not the basis of the rule of law,
p139
aVit's not the basis of a free society.
p140
aVSo, now I have the first of four propositions
p141
aVI'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:
p142
aVYou've got to judge law mainly
p143
aVby its effect on the broader society,
p144
aVnot individual disputes.
p145
aVAbsolutely vital.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second
p148
aVand look at our society from high above.
p149
aVIs it working?
p150
aVWhat does the macro-data show us?
p151
aVWell, the healthcare system has been transformed:
p152
aVa culture pervaded with defensiveness,
p153
aVuniversal distrust of the system of justice,
p154
aVuniversal practice of defensive medicine.
p155
aVIt's very hard to measure
p156
aVbecause there are mixed motives.
p157
aVDoctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,
p158
aVand also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.
p159
aVBut reliable estimates
p160
aVrange between 60 billion and
p161
aV200 billion dollars per year.
p162
aVThat's enough to provide care to all the people
p163
aVin America who don't have it.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear
p166
aVmakes doctors practice better medicine."
p167
aVWell that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine
p168
aVand others. Turns out that's not the case.
p169
aVThe fear has chilled professional interaction
p170
aVso thousands of tragic errors occur
p171
aVbecause doctors are afraid
p172
aVto speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"
p173
aVBecause they're not sure,
p174
aVand they don't want to take legal responsibility.
p175
aa(lp176
VLet's go to schools.
p177
aVAs we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,
p178
aVshe seems to be affected by the law.
p179
aVWell it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.
p180
aVYou could have a separate section of a law library
p181
aVaround each of the following legal concepts:
p182
aVdue process, special education,
p183
aVno child left behind,
p184
aVzero tolerance, work rules ...
p185
aVit goes on. We did a study
p186
aVof all the rules that affect one school
p187
aVin New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.
p188
aVTens of thousands of discreet rules,
p189
aV60 steps to suspend a student from school:
p190
aVIt's a formula for paralysis.
p191
aVWhat's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.
p192
aa(lp193
VAgain, studies have shown
p194
aVit's directly attributable
p195
aVto the rise of due process.
p196
aVPublic agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago
p197
aVwhere they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America
p198
aVsay that they spend at least half of their time
p199
aVmaintaining order in the classroom.
p200
aVThat means those students are getting half the learning
p201
aVthey're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class
p202
aVno one can learn.
p203
aVAnd what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?
p204
aVThey're threatened with a legal claim.
p205
aVWe also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers
p206
aVin America have been threatened by their students
p207
aVwith violating their rights, with lawsuits
p208
aVby their students. They are threatening, their students.
p209
aVIt's not that they usually sue,
p210
aVit's not that they would win, but it's an
p211
aVindication of the corrosion of authority.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd how has this system of law worked for government?
p214
aVIt doesn't seem to be working very well does it?
p215
aVNeither in Sacramento nor in Washington.
p216
aVThe other day at the State of the Union speech,
p217
aVPresident Obama said,
p218
aVand I think we could all agree with this goal,
p219
aV"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,
p220
aVour nation has always been the first to compete.
p221
aVThere is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."
p222
aVWell, actually there is a reason:
p223
aVEnvironmental review has evolved into a process
p224
aVof no pebble left unturned
p225
aVfor any major project taking the better part of a decade,
p226
aVthen followed by years of litigation
p227
aVby anybody who doesn't like the project.
p228
aa(lp229
VThen, just staying above the Earth for one more second,
p230
aVpeople are acting like idiots,
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVall across the country.
p233
aV(Applause)
p234
aVIdiots. A couple of years ago,
p235
aVBroward County, Florida, banned running at recess.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVThat means all the boys are going to be ADD.
p238
aVI mean it's just absolutely
p239
aVa formula for failure.
p240
aa(lp241
VMy favorite, though, are all the warning labels.
p242
aV"Caution: Contents are hot,"
p243
aVon billions of coffee cups.
p244
aVArcheologists will dig us up in a thousand years
p245
aVand they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,
p246
aVbut they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."
p247
aVThey'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.
p248
aVThat's the only explanation. Because why
p249
aVwould you have to tell people that something was actually hot?
p250
aVMy favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.
p251
aVI grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.
p252
aVFive-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,
p253
aVwith a three pronged hook in the back,
p254
aVand outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, none of these people
p258
aVare doing what they think is right.
p259
aVAnd why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?
p260
aVBecause it gives us the worst of both worlds:
p261
aVIt's random \u2014 anybody can sue for almost anything
p262
aVand take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency \u2014
p263
aVand it's also too detailed.
p264
aVIn the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules
p265
aVno human could possibly know it.
p266
aVWell how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes
p267
aVtrying to prune this legal jungle.
p268
aVBut the challenge here is not one of just
p269
aVamending the law,
p270
aVbecause the hurdle for success is trust.
p271
aa(lp272
VPeople \u2014 for law to be the platform for freedom,
p273
aVpeople have to trust it.
p274
aVSo, that's my second proposition:
p275
aVTrust is an essential condition
p276
aVto a free society.
p277
aVLife is complicated enough without legal fear.
p278
aVBut law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,
p279
aVbecause it carries with it the power of state.
p280
aVAnd so the state can come in.
p281
aVIt actually changes the way people think.
p282
aVIt's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders
p283
aVall day long, whispering in your ear,
p284
aV"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"
p285
aVIt drives people from the smart part of the brain \u2014
p286
aVthat dark, deep well of the subconscious,
p287
aVwhere instincts and experience,
p288
aVand all the other factors of creativity
p289
aVand good judgment are \u2014
p290
aVit drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.
p291
aa(lp292
VPretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt
p293
aVif that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me
p294
aVif it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."
p295
aVThen you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.
p296
aVIf you make people self-conscious
p297
aVabout their judgments, studies show
p298
aVyou will make them make worse judgments.
p299
aVIf you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes
p300
aVwhen she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.
p301
aVSelf-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.
p302
aVEdison stated it best. He said,
p303
aV"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,
p304
aVwe're trying to accomplish something."
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VSo, how do you restore trust?
p308
aVTweaking the law's clearly not good enough,
p309
aVand tort reform, which is a great idea,
p310
aVlowers your cost if you're a businessperson,
p311
aVbut it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.
p312
aVStates with extensive tort reform
p313
aVstill suffer all these pathologies.
p314
aVSo, what's needed is not just to limit claims,
p315
aVbut actually create a dry ground of freedom.
p316
aVIt turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.
p317
aVAnd it is this:
p318
aVLaw sets boundaries,
p319
aVand on one side of those boundaries are all the things
p320
aVyou can't do or must do \u2014
p321
aVyou can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes \u2014
p322
aVbut those same boundaries are supposed to define
p323
aVand protect a dry ground of freedom.
p324
aa(lp325
VIsaiah Berlin put it this way:
p326
aV"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,
p327
aVwithin which men shall be inviolable."
p328
aVWe've forgotten that second part.
p329
aVThose dikes have burst. People wade through law
p330
aVall day long.
p331
aVSo, what's needed now
p332
aVis to rebuild these boundaries.
p333
aVAnd it's especially important to rebuild them
p334
aVfor lawsuits.
p335
aVBecause what people can sue for establishes the boundaries
p336
aVfor everybody else's freedom.
p337
aVIf someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"
p338
aVit doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,
p339
aVall the seesaws will disappear.
p340
aVBecause no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.
p341
aVAnd that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,
p342
aVmerry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,
p343
aVnothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,
p344
aVbecause there's no risk associated with it.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo, how do we rebuild it?
p347
aVLife is too complex for...
p348
aV(Applause)
p349
aVLife is too complex for a software program.
p350
aVAll these choices involve value judgments
p351
aVand social norms, not objective facts.
p352
aVAnd so here is the fourth proposition.
p353
aVThis is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.
p354
aVAnd there are two essential elements of it:
p355
aVWe have to simplify the law.
p356
aVWe have to migrate from all this complexity
p357
aVtowards general principles and goals.
p358
aVThe constitution is only 16 pages long.
p359
aVWorked pretty well for 200 years.
p360
aa(lp361
VLaw has to be simple enough
p362
aVso that people can internalize it
p363
aVin their daily choices.
p364
aVIf they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
p365
aVAnd how do you make it simple?
p366
aVBecause life is complex,
p367
aVand here is the hardest and biggest change:
p368
aVWe have to restore the authority
p369
aVto judges and officials
p370
aVto interpret and apply the law.
p371
aV(Applause)
p372
aVWe have to rehumanize the law.
p373
aVTo make law simple so that you feel free,
p374
aVthe people in charge have to be free
p375
aVto use their judgment to interpret and apply the law
p376
aVin accord with reasonable social norms.
p377
aVAs you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,
p378
aVyou have to think that if there is a dispute,
p379
aVthere's somebody in society who sees it as their job
p380
aVto affirmatively protect you
p381
aVif you're acting reasonably.
p382
aVThat person doesn't exist today.
p383
aa(lp384
VThis is the hardest hurdle.
p385
aVIt's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.
p386
aVMaybe you've got a claim in small claims court
p387
aVfor your lost pair of pants for $100,
p388
aVbut not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.
p389
aVCase dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.
p390
aVTakes five minutes. That's it,
p391
aVit's not that hard.
p392
aa(lp393
VBut it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand
p394
aVbecause we woke up in the 1960s
p395
aVto all these really bad values: racism,
p396
aVgender discrimination, pollution \u2014
p397
aVthey were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system
p398
aVwhere no one could have bad values anymore.
p399
aVThe problem is, we created a system
p400
aVwhere we eliminated the right to have good values.
p401
aVIt doesn't mean that people in authority
p402
aVcan do whatever they want.
p403
aVThey're still bounded by legal goals and principles:
p404
aVThe teacher is accountable to the principal,
p405
aVthe judge is accountable to an appellate court,
p406
aVthe president is accountable to voters.
p407
aVBut the accountability's up the line
p408
aVjudging the decision against the effect on everybody,
p409
aVnot just on the disgruntled person.
p410
aVYou can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.
p411
aV(Applause)
p412
aa(lp413
VSo, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.
p414
aVWe can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.
p415
aVWe've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.
p416
aVIt's not true. Authority, in fact,
p417
aVis essential to freedom.
p418
aVLaw is a human institution;
p419
aVresponsibility is a human institution.
p420
aVIf teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,
p421
aVto maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.
p422
aVIf the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,
p423
aVthen all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.
p424
aVIf the environmental agency can't decide
p425
aVthat the power lines are good for the environment,
p426
aVthen there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms
p427
aVto the city.
p428
aVA free society requires red lights and green lights,
p429
aVotherwise it soon descends into gridlock.
p430
aVThat's what's happened to America. Look around.
p431
aa(lp432
VWhat the world needs now
p433
aVis to restore the authority to make common choices.
p434
aVIt's the only way to get our freedom back,
p435
aVand it's the only way to release the energy and passion
p436
aVneeded so that we can meet the challenges
p437
aVof our time. Thank you.
