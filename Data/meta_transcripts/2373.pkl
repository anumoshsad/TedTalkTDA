VHave you ever wondered what animals think and feel?
p4
aVLet's start with a question:
p5
aVDoes my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat?
p6
aVWell, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us,
p7
aVeasy to see, right,
p8
aVwhat's going on in that fuzzy little head.
p9
aVWhat is going on?
p10
aVSomething's going on.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut why is the question always do they love us?
p13
aVWhy is it always about us?
p14
aVWhy are we such narcissists?
p15
aVI found a different question to ask animals.
p16
aVWho are you?
p17
aa(lp18
VThere are capacities of the human mind
p19
aVthat we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind.
p20
aVBut is that true?
p21
aVWhat are other beings doing with those brains?
p22
aVWhat are they thinking and feeling?
p23
aVIs there a way to know?
p24
aVI think there is a way in.
p25
aVI think there are several ways in.
p26
aVWe can look at evolution, we can look at their brains
p27
aVand we can watch what they do.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited.
p30
aVThe first neurons came from jellyfish.
p31
aVJellyfish gave rise to the first chordates.
p32
aVThe first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates.
p33
aVThe vertebrates came out of the sea,
p34
aVand here we are.
p35
aVBut it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same
p36
aVin a crayfish, a bird or you.
p37
aVWhat does that say about the minds of crayfish?
p38
aVCan we tell anything about that?
p39
aVWell, it turns out that if you give a crayfish
p40
aVa lot of little tiny electric shocks
p41
aVevery time it tries to come out of its burrow,
p42
aVit will develop anxiety.
p43
aVIf you give the crayfish the same drug
p44
aVused to treat anxiety disorder in humans,
p45
aVit relaxes and comes out and explores.
p46
aVHow do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety?
p47
aVMostly, we boil them.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VOctopuses use tools, as well as do most apes
p52
aVand they recognize human faces.
p53
aVHow do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate?
p54
aVMostly boiled.
p55
aVIf a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral,
p56
aVit will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping
p57
aVand it will signal to the moray, "Follow me,"
p58
aVand the moray will understand that signal.
p59
aVThe moray may go into the crevice and get the fish,
p60
aVbut the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it.
p61
aVThis is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about.
p62
aVHow do we celebrate that ancient partnership?
p63
aVMostly fried.
p64
aVA pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us
p65
aVthan it does about them.
p66
aa(lp67
VSea otters use tools
p68
aVand they take time away from what they're doing
p69
aVto show their babies what to do, which is called teaching.
p70
aVChimpanzees don't teach.
p71
aVKiller whales teach and killer whales share food.
p72
aa(lp73
VWhen evolution makes something new,
p74
aVit uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf,
p75
aVbefore it fabricates a new twist.
p76
aVAnd our brain has come to us
p77
aVthrough the enormity of the deep sweep of time.
p78
aVIf you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain,
p79
aVwhat you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain.
p80
aVIt's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VBut, uh oh, there's a dolphin,
p85
aVa bigger brain with more convolutions.
p86
aVOK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains,
p87
aVbut what does that have to say about minds?
p88
aVWell, we can see the working of the mind
p89
aVin the logic of behaviors.
p90
aVSo these elephants, you can see,
p91
aVobviously, they are resting.
p92
aVThey have found a patch of shade under the palm trees
p93
aVunder which to let their babies sleep,
p94
aVwhile they doze but remain vigilant.
p95
aVWe make perfect sense of that image
p96
aVjust as they make perfect sense of what they're doing
p97
aVbecause under the arc of the same sun on the same plains,
p98
aVlistening to the howls of the same dangers,
p99
aVthey became who they are and we became who we are.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe've been neighbors for a very long time.
p102
aVNo one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed.
p103
aVThey're obviously very concerned about something.
p104
aVWhat are they concerned about?
p105
aVIt turns out that if you record the voices of tourists
p106
aVand you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes,
p107
aVelephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants.
p108
aVBut if you record the voices of herders
p109
aVwho carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes,
p110
aVthe elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker.
p111
aVNot only do elephants know that there are humans,
p112
aVthey know that there are different kinds of humans,
p113
aVand that some are OK and some are dangerous.
p114
aa(lp115
VThey have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them.
p116
aVThey know us better than we know them.
p117
aVWe have the same imperatives:
p118
aVtake care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive.
p119
aVWhether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa
p120
aVor outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same.
p121
aVWe are kin under the skin.
p122
aVThe elephant has the same skeleton,
p123
aVthe killer whale has the same skeleton,
p124
aVas do we.
p125
aVWe see helping where help is needed.
p126
aVWe see curiosity in the young.
p127
aVWe see the bonds of family connections.
p128
aVWe recognize affection.
p129
aVCourtship is courtship.
p130
aVAnd then we ask, "Are they conscious?"
p131
aa(lp132
VWhen you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious,
p133
aVwhich means you have no sensation of anything.
p134
aVConsciousness is simply the thing that feels like something.
p135
aVIf you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything,
p136
aVyou are conscious, and they are conscious.
p137
aa(lp138
VSome people say
p139
aVwell, there are certain things that make humans humans,
p140
aVand one of those things is empathy.
p141
aVEmpathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions.
p142
aVIt's a very useful thing.
p143
aVIf your companions start to move quickly,
p144
aVyou have to feel like you need to hurry up.
p145
aVWe're all in a hurry now.
p146
aVThe oldest form of empathy is contagious fear.
p147
aVIf your companions suddenly startle and fly away,
p148
aVit does not work very well for you to say,
p149
aV"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VEmpathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life,
p154
aVcomes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration.
p155
aVSo there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad.
p156
aVI see you happy, it makes me happy.
p157
aa(lp158
VThen there's something that I call sympathy,
p159
aVa little more removed:
p160
aV"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away.
p161
aVI don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel
p162
aVand it concerns me."
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd then if we're motivated to act on sympathy,
p165
aVI call that compassion.
p166
aa(lp167
VFar from being the thing that makes us human,
p168
aVhuman empathy is far from perfect.
p169
aVWe round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them.
p170
aVNow, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species.
p171
aVThat's just predation, and humans are predators.
p172
aVBut we don't treat our own kind too well either.
p173
aVPeople who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior
p174
aVknow that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions
p175
aVto other species.
p176
aVWell, I think that's silly,
p177
aVbecause attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species
p178
aVis the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling,
p179
aVbecause their brains are basically the same as ours.
p180
aVThey have the same structures.
p181
aVThe same hormones that create mood and motivation in us
p182
aVare in those brains as well.
p183
aVIt is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting
p184
aVand they're tired when their tongues are hanging out,
p185
aVand then say when they're playing with their children
p186
aVand acting joyful and happy,
p187
aVwe have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything.
p188
aVThat is not scientific.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo OK, so a reporter said to me,
p191
aV"Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?"
p192
aVAnd I started to rifle through all the hundreds
p193
aVof scientific references that I put in my book
p194
aVand I realized that the answer was right in the room with me.
p195
aVWhen my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me \u2014
p196
aVnot to the couch, to me \u2014
p197
aVand she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly,
p198
aVshe has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed.
p199
aVI know that I can go over to Carl,
p200
aVhe will understand what I'm asking.
p201
aVI know I can trust him because we're family.
p202
aVHe'll get the job done, and it will feel good."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VShe has thought and she has felt,
p207
aVand it's really not more complicated than that.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,
p210
aVwolves, elephants:
p211
aVthat's not how they see it."
p212
aa(lp213
VThat tall-finned male is L41.
p214
aVHe's 38 years old.
p215
aVThe female right on his left side is L22.
p216
aVShe's 44.
p217
aVThey've known each other for decades.
p218
aVThey know exactly who they are.
p219
aVThey know who their friends are.
p220
aVThey know who their rivals are.
p221
aVTheir life follows the arc of a career.
p222
aVThey know where they are all the time.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis is an elephant named Philo.
p225
aVHe was a young male.
p226
aVThis is him four days later.
p227
aVHumans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it.
p228
aVWe want to carve their teeth.
p229
aVWhy can't we wait for them to die?
p230
aVElephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea
p231
aVall the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.
p232
aVIn 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range
p233
aVin Central and Eastern Africa.
p234
aVAnd now their range is shattered into little shards.
p235
aVThis is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction,
p236
aVa fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.
p237
aa(lp238
VOf course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States.
p239
aVIn Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf.
p240
aVWe killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually.
p241
aVBut in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s,
p242
aVand then 60 years later they had to bring them back,
p243
aVbecause the elk numbers had gotten out of control.
p244
aVAnd then people came.
p245
aVPeople came by the thousands to see the wolves,
p246
aVthe most accessibly visible wolves in the world.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves.
p249
aVA pack is a family.
p250
aVIt has some breeding adults and the young of several generations.
p251
aVAnd I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park.
p252
aVAnd then, when they wandered just outside the border,
p253
aVtwo of their adults were killed,
p254
aVincluding the mother,
p255
aVwhich we sometimes call the alpha female.
p256
aVThe rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry.
p257
aVSisters kicked out other sisters.
p258
aVThat one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family.
p259
aVThey wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her.
p260
aVShe was getting too much attention from two new males,
p261
aVand she was the precocious one.
p262
aVThat was too much for them.
p263
aVShe wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot.
p264
aVThe alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family.
p265
aVAs winter was coming in,
p266
aVhe lost his territory, his hunting support,
p267
aVthe members of his family and his mate.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe cause so much pain to them.
p270
aVThe mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do?
p271
aVThis whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale
p272
aVwith his companions who had killed that whale.
p273
aVThose people in the boat had nothing at all to fear.
p274
aVThis whale is T20.
p275
aVHe had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions.
p276
aVThe seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat.
p277
aVThey had nothing to fear.
p278
aVThey eat seals.
p279
aVWhy don't they eat us?
p280
aVWhy can we trust them around our toddlers?
p281
aVWhy is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog
p282
aVand led them miles until the fog parted
p283
aVand the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline?
p284
aVAnd that's happened more than one time.
p285
aa(lp286
VIn the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing,
p287
aVand she studies spotted dolphins and they know her.
p288
aVShe knows them very well. She knows who they all are.
p289
aVThey know her. They recognize the research boat.
p290
aVWhen she shows up, it's a big happy reunion.
p291
aVExcept, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat,
p292
aVand that was really strange.
p293
aVAnd they couldn't figure out what was going on
p294
aVuntil somebody came out on deck
p295
aVand announced that one of the people onboard had died
p296
aVduring a nap in his bunk.
p297
aVHow could dolphins know that one of the human hearts
p298
aVhad just stopped?
p299
aVWhy would they care?
p300
aVAnd why would it spook them?
p301
aVThese mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on
p302
aVin the minds that are with us on Earth
p303
aVthat we almost never think about at all.
p304
aa(lp305
VAt an aquarium in South Africa
p306
aVwas a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly.
p307
aVShe was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break
p308
aVand he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking.
p309
aVDolly came over and looked at him,
p310
aVwent back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two,
p311
aVcame back to the window
p312
aVand released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke.
p313
aVSomehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin
p314
aVgot the idea of using milk to represent smoke.
p315
aVWhen human beings use one thing to represent another,
p316
aVwe call that art.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VThe things that make us human
p321
aVare not the things that we think make us human.
p322
aVWhat makes us human is that,
p323
aVof all these things that our minds and their minds have,
p324
aVwe are the most extreme.
p325
aVWe are the most compassionate,
p326
aVmost violent, most creative
p327
aVand most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet,
p328
aVand we are all of those things all jumbled up together.
p329
aVBut love is not the thing that makes us human.
p330
aVIt's not special to us.
p331
aVWe are not the only ones who care about our mates.
p332
aVWe are not the only ones who care about our children.
p333
aa(lp334
VAlbatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles
p335
aVover several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal,
p336
aVto their chick who is waiting for them.
p337
aVThey nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world,
p338
aVand this is what it looks like.
p339
aVPassing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being.
p340
aVIf that stops, it all goes away.
p341
aVIf anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship
p342
aVcomes our plastic trash.
p343
aVAll of these birds have plastic in them now.
p344
aVThis is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge \u2014
p345
aVdied, packed with red cigarette lighters.
p346
aa(lp347
VThis is not the relationship we are supposed to have
p348
aVwith the rest of the world.
p349
aVBut we, who have named ourselves after our brains,
p350
aVnever think about the consequences.
p351
aVWhen we welcome new human life into the world,
p352
aVwe welcome our babies into the company of other creatures.
p353
aVWe paint animals on the walls.
p354
aVWe don't paint cell phones.
p355
aVWe don't paint work cubicles.
p356
aVWe paint animals to show them that we are not alone.
p357
aVWe have company.
p358
aVAnd every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark,
p359
aVdeemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now,
p360
aVand their flood is us.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo we started with a question:
p363
aVDo they love us?
p364
aVWe're going to ask another question.
p365
aVAre we capable of using what we have
p366
aVto care enough to simply let them continue?
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you very much.
