VBeverly Joubert: We are truly passionate
p4
aVabout the African wilderness
p5
aVand protecting the African wilderness,
p6
aVand so what we've done
p7
aVis we've focused on iconic cats.
p8
aVAnd I know,
p9
aVin the light of human suffering and poverty
p10
aVand even climate change,
p11
aVone would wonder,
p12
aVwhy worry about a few cats?
p13
aVWell today we're here
p14
aVto share with you a message that we have learned
p15
aVfrom a very important and special character \u2014
p16
aVthis leopard.
p17
aa(lp18
VDereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been
p19
aVlike a super long episode of "CSI" \u2014
p20
aVsomething like 28 years.
p21
aVIn essence, what we've done
p22
aVis we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,
p23
aVwe've seen over 2,000 kills
p24
aVby these amazing animals.
p25
aVBut one of the things that science really lets us down on
p26
aVis that personality,
p27
aVthat individual personality that these animals have.
p28
aVAnd here's a prime example.
p29
aVWe found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old
p30
aVbaobab tree in Africa,
p31
aVthe same tree that we found her mother in
p32
aVand her grandmother.
p33
aVAnd she took us on a journey
p34
aVand revealed something very special to us \u2014
p35
aVher own daughter, eight days old.
p36
aVAnd the minute we found this leopard,
p37
aVwe realized that we needed to move in,
p38
aVand so we basically stayed with this leopard
p39
aVfor the next four-and-a-half years \u2014
p40
aVfollowing her every day,
p41
aVgetting to know her,
p42
aVthat individual personality of hers,
p43
aVand really coming to know her.
p44
aVNow I'm destined
p45
aVto spend a lot of time
p46
aVwith some unique,
p47
aVvery, very special,
p48
aVindividualistic
p49
aVand often seductive female characters.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVBeverly's clearly one of them,
p52
aVand this little leopard, Legadema, is another,
p53
aVand she changed our lives.
p54
aa(lp55
VBJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her \u2014
p56
aVin fact, more time than even her mother did.
p57
aVWhen her mother would go off hunting,
p58
aVwe would stay and film.
p59
aVAnd early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree
p60
aV20 paces away from us.
p61
aVIt was frightening,
p62
aVand it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.
p63
aVAnd of course, we were stunned for a while,
p64
aVbut when we managed to get our wits about us,
p65
aVwe looked at it and said, "My gosh,
p66
aVwhat's going to happen with that little cub?
p67
aVShe's probably going to forever associate
p68
aVthat deafening crash with us."
p69
aVWell, we needn't have worried.
p70
aVShe came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,
p71
aVsat next to us, shivering,
p72
aVwith her back towards Dereck, and looking out.
p73
aVAnd actually from that day on,
p74
aVshe's been comfortable with us.
p75
aVSo we felt that that day
p76
aVwas the day that she really earned her name.
p77
aVWe called her Legadema,
p78
aVwhich means, "light from the sky."
p79
aa(lp80
VDJ: Now we've found these individualisms
p81
aVin all sorts of animals,
p82
aVin particular in the cats.
p83
aVThis particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,
p84
aV"he who greets with fire,"
p85
aVand you can just see that about him, you know \u2014 that's his character.
p86
aVBut only by getting up close to these animals
p87
aVand spending time with them
p88
aVcan we actually even reach out
p89
aVand dig out these personal characters that they have.
p90
aa(lp91
VBJ: But through our investigation,
p92
aVwe have to seek the wildest places in Africa.
p93
aVAnd right now this is in the Okavango Delta
p94
aVin Botswana.
p95
aVYes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,
p96
aVbut I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.
p97
aVBut also, our hearts are in our throats
p98
aVa huge amount of the time,
p99
aVbecause we're driving through water,
p100
aVand it's an unknown territory.
p101
aVBut we're really there
p102
aVseeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.
p103
aa(lp104
VDJ: Now one of the big things, of course,
p105
aVeverybody knows that cats hate water,
p106
aVand so this was a real revelation for us.
p107
aVAnd we could only find this by pushing ourselves,
p108
aVby going where no sane person should go \u2014
p109
aVnot without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly \u2014
p110
aVand just pushing the envelope,
p111
aVgoing out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.
p112
aVBut we've managed to find that these lions
p113
aVare 15 percent bigger than any others,
p114
aVand they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.
p115
aa(lp116
VBJ: And then of course, the challenge
p117
aVis knowing when to turn around.
p118
aVWe don't always get that right,
p119
aVand on this particular day,
p120
aVwe seriously underestimated the depth.
p121
aVWe got deeper and deeper,
p122
aVuntil it was at Dereck's chest-height.
p123
aVWell then we hit a deep depression,
p124
aVand we seriously submerged the vehicle.
p125
aVWe actually managed to drown
p126
aVtwo million dollars' worth of camera gear.
p127
aVWe drowned our pride, I must tell you,
p128
aVwhich was really serious,
p129
aVand we seized the engine.
p130
aa(lp131
VDJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle
p132
aVis that he who drowns the vehicle
p133
aVgets to swim with the crocodiles.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVYou will notice also that all of these images here
p136
aVare taken from the top angle by Beverly \u2014
p137
aVthe dry top angle, by the way.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVBut all the places we get stuck in really have great views.
p140
aVAnd it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,
p141
aVand Beverly was able to get a great photograph.
p142
aa(lp143
VBJ: But we truly do
p144
aVspend day and night
p145
aVtrying to capture unique footage.
p146
aVAnd 20 years ago,
p147
aVwe did a film called "Eternal Enemies"
p148
aVwhere we managed to capture
p149
aVthis unusual disturbing behavior across two species \u2014
p150
aVlions and hyenas.
p151
aVAnd surprisingly, it became a cult film.
p152
aVAnd we can only work that out
p153
aVas people were seeing parallels
p154
aVbetween the thuggish side of nature
p155
aVand gang warfare.
p156
aa(lp157
VDJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion
p158
aVis doing exactly what his name,
p159
aVEetwidomayloh, represents.
p160
aVHe's focused on this hyena,
p161
aVand he is going to get it.
p162
aV(Animal sounds)
p163
aVBut that's, I think, what this is all about,
p164
aVis that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
p165
aVBut for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,
p166
aVbut we live by certain rules of engagement,
p167
aVwhich mean we can't interfere.
p168
aVThis sort of behavior has been going on
p169
aVfor three, four, five million years,
p170
aVand we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."
p171
aVBut that's not always easy for us.
p172
aa(lp173
VBJ: So, as Dereck says,
p174
aVwe have to work through extremes \u2014
p175
aVextreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.
p176
aVSleep deprivation is extreme.
p177
aVWe're on the edge
p178
aVthrough a large part of the time.
p179
aVBut, for 10 years, we tried to capture
p180
aVlions and elephants together \u2014
p181
aVand never ever managed
p182
aVuntil this particular night.
p183
aVAnd I have to tell you
p184
aVthat it was a disturbing night for me.
p185
aVI had tears rolling down my cheeks.
p186
aVI was shaking with anxiety,
p187
aVbut I knew that [I had] to capture something
p188
aVthat had never been seen before, had never been documented.
p189
aVAnd I do believe you should stay with us.
p190
aa(lp191
VDJ: The amazing thing about these moments \u2014
p192
aVand this is probably a highlight of our career \u2014
p193
aVis that you never know how it's going to end.
p194
aVMany people believe, in fact,
p195
aVthat death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,
p196
aVnot in the lungs,
p197
aVand that's when people give up hope,
p198
aVor when any life form gives up hope.
p199
aVAnd you can see the start of it here.
p200
aVThis elephant, against overwhelming odds,
p201
aVsimply gives up hope.
p202
aVBut by the same token,
p203
aVyou can get your hope back again.
p204
aVSo just when you think it's all over, something else happens,
p205
aVsome spark gets into you,
p206
aVsome sort of will to fight \u2014
p207
aVthat iron will that we all have,
p208
aVthat this elephant has,
p209
aVthat conservation has, that big cats have.
p210
aVEverything has that will to survive,
p211
aVto fight, to push through that mental barrier
p212
aVand to keep going.
p213
aVAnd for us, in many ways,
p214
aVthis elephant has become
p215
aVa symbol of inspiration for us,
p216
aVa symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VNow back to the leopard.
p221
aVWe were spending so much time with this leopard
p222
aVand getting to understand her individualism,
p223
aVher personal character,
p224
aVthat maybe we were taking it a little bit far.
p225
aVWe were perhaps taking her for granted,
p226
aVand maybe she didn't like that that much.
p227
aVThis is about couples working together,
p228
aVand so I do need to say that within the vehicle
p229
aVwe have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.
p230
aVBeverly sits on the one side
p231
aVwhere all her camera gear is,
p232
aVand I'm on the other side where my space is.
p233
aVThese are precious to us, these divides.
p234
aa(lp235
VBJ: But when this little cub saw
p236
aVthat I had vacated my seat
p237
aVand climbed to the back to get some camera gear,
p238
aVshe came in like a curious cat
p239
aVto come and investigate.
p240
aVIt was phenomenal, and we felt grateful
p241
aVthat she trusted us to that extent.
p242
aVBut at the same time, we were concerned
p243
aVthat if she created this as a habit
p244
aVand jumped into somebody else's car,
p245
aVit might not turn out the same way \u2014
p246
aVshe might get shot for that.
p247
aVSo we knew we had to react quickly.
p248
aVAnd the only way we thought we could
p249
aVwithout scaring her
p250
aVis to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make \u2014
p251
aVa hiss and a sound.
p252
aVSo Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car \u2014
p253
aVvery innovative.
p254
aa(lp255
VDJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,
p256
aVbecause Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVBut really and truly, this was how
p259
aVthis little leopard was displaying
p260
aVher individual personality.
p261
aVBut nothing prepared us
p262
aVfor what happened next in our relationship with her,
p263
aVwhen she started hunting.
p264
aa(lp265
VBJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.
p266
aVIt was like watching a graduation ceremony.
p267
aVWe felt like we were surrogate parents.
p268
aVAnd of course, we knew now
p269
aVthat she was going to survive.
p270
aVBut only when we saw the tiny baby baboon
p271
aVclinging to the mother's fur
p272
aVdid we realize that something very unique
p273
aVwas taking place here with Legadema.
p274
aVAnd of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,
p275
aVit didn't turn and run.
p276
aVSo what we watched
p277
aVover the next couple of hours
p278
aVwas very unique.
p279
aVIt was absolutely amazing
p280
aVwhen she picked it up to safety,
p281
aVprotecting it from the hyena.
p282
aVAnd over the next five hours,
p283
aVshe took care of it.
p284
aVWe realized that we actually don't know everything,
p285
aVand that nature is so unpredictable,
p286
aVwe have to be open at all times.
p287
aa(lp288
VDJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVBut in fact,
p291
aVwhat we were seeing here was interesting.
p292
aVBecause she is a cub wanting to play,
p293
aVbut she was also a predator needing to kill,
p294
aVand yet conflicted in some way,
p295
aVbecause she was also an emerging mother.
p296
aVShe had this maternal instinct,
p297
aVmuch like a young girl on her way to womanhood,
p298
aVand so this really took us to this new level
p299
aVof understanding that personality.
p300
aa(lp301
VBJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.
p302
aVThey ended up sleeping for hours.
p303
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014
p304
aVeverybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"
p305
aVIt did die,
p306
aVand we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.
p307
aa(lp308
VDJ: So at this stage, I guess,
p309
aVwe had very, very firm ideas
p310
aVon what conservation meant.
p311
aVWe had to deal with these individual personalities.
p312
aVWe had to deal with them with respect
p313
aVand celebrate them.
p314
aVAnd so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative
p315
aVto march forward into conservation,
p316
aVtaking care of the big cats that we loved \u2014
p317
aVand then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years
p318
aVto see how well we had all collectively been doing.
p319
aVSo when Beverly and I were born,
p320
aVthere were 450,000 lions,
p321
aVand today there are 20,000.
p322
aVTigers haven't fared any better \u2014
p323
aV45,000
p324
aVdown to maybe 3,000.
p325
aa(lp326
VBJ: And then cheetahs have crashed
p327
aVall the way down to 12,000.
p328
aVLeopards have plummeted
p329
aVfrom 700,000
p330
aVdown to a mere 50,000.
p331
aVNow in the extraordinary time
p332
aVthat we have worked with Legadema \u2014
p333
aVwhich is really over a five-year period \u2014
p334
aV10,000 leopards were legally shot
p335
aVby safari hunters.
p336
aVAnd that's not the only leopards
p337
aVthat were being killed through that period.
p338
aVThere's an immense amount of poaching as well,
p339
aVand so possibly the same amount.
p340
aVIt's simply not sustainable.
p341
aVWe admire them,
p342
aVand we fear them,
p343
aVand yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
p344
aVIt used to be the time
p345
aVwhere only kings wore a leopard skin,
p346
aVbut now throughout rituals and ceremonies,
p347
aVtraditional healers and ministers.
p348
aVAnd of course, looking at this lion paw
p349
aVthat has been skinned,
p350
aVit eerily reminds me
p351
aVof a human hand,
p352
aVand that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.
p353
aa(lp354
VDJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.
p355
aVSouth Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.
p356
aVLion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,
p357
aVand so in a stroke, the lion bone industry
p358
aVis going to wipe out all the tigers.
p359
aVSo we have a real problem here,
p360
aVno more so than the lions do, the male lions.
p361
aVSo the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw
p362
aVis actually a red herring,
p363
aVbecause there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,
p364
aVand they all are actually
p365
aVinfected with the same disease.
p366
aVI call it complacency \u2014
p367
aVour complacency.
p368
aVBecause there's a sport, there's an activity going on
p369
aVthat we're all aware of, that we condone.
p370
aVAnd that's probably because we haven't seen it
p371
aVlike we are today.
p372
aa(lp373
VBJ: And you have to know
p374
aVthat, when a male lion is killed,
p375
aVit completely disrupts the whole pride.
p376
aVA new male comes into the area
p377
aVand takes over the pride,
p378
aVand, of course, first of all kills all the cubs
p379
aVand possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.
p380
aVSo we've estimated
p381
aVthat between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed
p382
aVwhen one lion is hanging on a wall
p383
aVsomewhere in a far-off place.
p384
aa(lp385
VDJ: So what our investigations have shown
p386
aVis that these lions are essential.
p387
aVThey're essential to the habitat.
p388
aVIf they disappear,
p389
aVwhole ecosystems in Africa disappear.
p390
aVThere's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year
p391
aVecotourism revenue stream into Africa.
p392
aVSo this is not just a concern about lions;
p393
aVit's a concern about communities in Africa as well.
p394
aVIf they disappear, all of that goes away.
p395
aVBut what I'm more concerned about in many ways
p396
aVis that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,
p397
aVas we de-link ourselves spiritually
p398
aVfrom these animals,
p399
aVwe lose hope,
p400
aVwe lose that spiritual connection,
p401
aVour dignity, that thing within us
p402
aVthat keeps us connected to the planet.
p403
aa(lp404
VBJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes
p405
aVof lions and leopards right now,
p406
aVit is all about critical awareness.
p407
aVAnd so what we are doing,
p408
aVin February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"
p409
aVand "The Last Lion" is exactly
p410
aVwhat is happening right now.
p411
aVThat is the situation we're in \u2014
p412
aVthe last lions.
p413
aVThat is, if we don't take action and do something,
p414
aVthese plains will be completely devoid
p415
aVof big cats,
p416
aVand then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
p417
aVAnd simply, if we can't protect them,
p418
aVwe're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.
p419
aa(lp420
VDJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about
p421
aVand designed our lives by \u2014
p422
aVthat conservation was all about respect
p423
aVand celebration \u2014
p424
aVis probably true. That's really what it needs.
p425
aVWe need it. We respect and celebrate each other
p426
aVas a man and a woman, as a community
p427
aVand as part of this planet,
p428
aVand we need to continue that.
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd Legadema?
p431
aVWell we can report, in fact,
p432
aVthat we're grandparents.
p433
