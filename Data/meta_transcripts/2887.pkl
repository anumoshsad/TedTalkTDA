VI took a cell phone
p4
aVand accidentally made myself famous.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI was just talking about the things that I cared about,
p9
aVbut with the click of a button
p10
aVand an incendiary viral video
p11
aVI propelled myself into overnight stardom.
p12
aVWhen I say overnight,
p13
aVI mean I literally woke up the next morning
p14
aVwith so many notifications on my phone,
p15
aVI thought I slept through a national tragedy.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VIt was the craziest thing, guys,
p20
aVbut when it came to my influence and my exposure,
p21
aVI literally took a quantum leap.
p22
aVSo I made more videos
p23
aVand the subject matter of my videos
p24
aVwas often the most divisive subject in American life,
p25
aVbut it was the way that I articulated race
p26
aVthat made me somewhat of a digital lightning rod.
p27
aVSee, being a survivor myself of police brutality
p28
aVand having lost a childhood friend,
p29
aVAlonzo Ashley,
p30
aVat the hands of the police,
p31
aVI had a little something to say about the topic.
p32
aVYou see, this was at the height of the Black Lives Matter furor
p33
aVand people seemed to be turning to me to articulate their viewpoints,
p34
aVand honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.
p35
aa(lp36
VYou see, the internet has this interesting quality.
p37
aVIn one way, it totally brought the world together,
p38
aVand I remember being a kid
p39
aVand all of this utopian propaganda was being dumped on us
p40
aVabout how the World Wide Web
p41
aVwas going to span the reaches of people across the globe.
p42
aVBut as it turns out, people are people.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd this magical superhighway
p47
aValso took the demons of our nature
p48
aVand gave them Ferraris.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VYou see, technology, y'all, is a lot like money.
p53
aVIt just brings out what's already inside you and amplifies it.
p54
aVAnd so I soon became familiar with the phenomenon of the internet troll.
p55
aVThese guys seem to live beneath the bridges
p56
aVof said superhighway \u2014
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd they also missed the memo about the enlightenment of the internet age.
p61
aVI remember being called
p62
aVhighly colorful racial slurs
p63
aVby those who use the anonymity of the internet
p64
aVas a Klan hood.
p65
aVAnd some of them were pretty creative, actually,
p66
aVbut others were pretty wounding,
p67
aVespecially navigating the post-traumatic world
p68
aVof a police brutality survivor
p69
aVin the height of Black Lives Matter,
p70
aVwith all of these people being killed on my timeline.
p71
aVTo these trolls, I wasn't a human.
p72
aVI was an idea, an object,
p73
aVa caricature.
p74
aVDid I mention that this race stuff can be kind of divisive?
p75
aVYou see, I'm an innately curious person
p76
aVand as I drew my sword to engage in epic battles in the comment section \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VI also began to notice
p81
aVthat a few of my trolls actually had brains,
p82
aVwhich made me even more curious and what to understand them even further.
p83
aVAnd although these supposed morons
p84
aVengaged in what appeared to be original thought,
p85
aVI said to myself,
p86
aV"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,
p87
aVat least according to my knowledge."
p88
aVWhere are these guys getting these arguments from?
p89
aVLike, was there some kind of alternative universe
p90
aVwith alternative facts?
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VWas history and gravity optional over there?
p97
aVI don't know.
p98
aVBut I needed to know. Like, I wanted to know.
p99
aVAnd as it turns out, I had no idea about digital echo chambers.
p100
aVThat same target marketing algorithm
p101
aVthat feeds you more of the products you like to buy
p102
aValso feeds you more of the news that you like to hear.
p103
aVI had been living in an online universe
p104
aVthat just reflected my worldview back to me.
p105
aVSo my timeline was pretty liberal.
p106
aVI had no Breitbart or Infowars or Fox News.
p107
aVNo, no, I was all MSNBC and The Daily Show,
p108
aVCNN and theGrio, right?
p109
aVWell, these trolls were hopping the dimensional doorway
p110
aVand I needed to figure out how.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo what I decided to do
p115
aVwas trick the Facebook algorithm
p116
aVinto feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with,
p117
aVand this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough,
p118
aVbecause my online footprint
p119
aValready established the patterns that I like to hear.
p120
aVSo with the anonymity of the internet,
p121
aVI went undercover.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VI set up this ghost profile and went crazy.
p126
aVNow, on a practical level, it was very simple,
p127
aVbut on an emotional level, it was kind of daunting,
p128
aVespecially with the racist vitriol that I had experienced.
p129
aVBut what I didn't realize is that my trolls were inoculating me,
p130
aVthickening my skin,
p131
aVmaking me immune to viewpoints that I didn't necessarily agree with,
p132
aVand so I didn't react to the same things as I would have several months prior.
p133
aVAll right? So I pressed on.
p134
aa(lp135
VNoticing that this stuff also worked on YouTube,
p136
aVI became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker \u2014
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd digitally I began to infiltrate the infamous alt-right movement.
p141
aVNow, my doppelgänger
p142
aVwas Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character \u2014
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
Va sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier.
p147
aVAnd to think, like, years ago, I would have needed acting training
p148
aVand, like, makeup and a fake ID.
p149
aVNow I could just lurk.
p150
aVAnd so I started
p151
aVwith a little Infowars,
p152
aVwent on into some American Renaissance,
p153
aVNational Vanguard Alliance,
p154
aVand, you know, I started commenting on videos,
p155
aVtalking bad about Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter.
p156
aVI started bemoaning race baiters like Eric Holder and Barack Obama
p157
aVand just mirroring the antiblack sentiments
p158
aVthat were thrown at me.
p159
aVAnd to be honest, it was kind of exhilarating.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VLike, I would literally spend days clicking through my new racist profile \u2014
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VGoofing off at work in Aryan land. It was something else.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd so I then started visiting some of the pages
p172
aVof my former trolls,
p173
aVand a lot of these guys were just regular Joes,
p174
aVa lot of outdoorsmen, hunters, computer nerds,
p175
aVsome of them family guys with videos of their families.
p176
aVI mean, for all I know, some of y'all could be in this room right now. Right?
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut when I went undercover, I found a lovely plethora of characters,
p181
aVluminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and David Duke.
p182
aVAll of these guys were thought leaders in their own right,
p183
aVbut over time, the alt-right movement ended up using their information
p184
aVto fuel their momentum.
p185
aVAnd I'm going to tell you what else led to the momentum of the alt-right:
p186
aVthe left wing's wholesale demonization of everything white and male.
p187
aVIf you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, you're in league with Satan.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, would you believe,
p192
aVwould you believe that some people find that offensive?
p193
aVAnd \u2014
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd so, I mean, listen,
p198
aVthe fact is that millennials get a lifetime of diet brand history.
p199
aVI mean, America seems to be hellbent on filling its textbooks
p200
aVwith CliffsNotes versions of its dark past.
p201
aVThis severely, severely decontextualizes race and the anger associated with it,
p202
aVand that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow.
p203
aVAdd in the wild landscape of the internet
p204
aVand it's easy to sell rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas
p205
aVto a generation who has been failed by public schools.
p206
aa(lp207
VA lot of these ideas, easily debunked.
p208
aVAlt-facts have that quality.
p209
aVHowever, one theme kept screaming at me through the subtext of those arguments,
p210
aVand that was,
p211
aVwhy should I be hated for who I cannot help but be?
p212
aVNow, as a black man in America, that resonated with me.
p213
aVI have spent so much time
p214
aVdefending myself against attempts to demonize me
p215
aVand make me apologize for who I am,
p216
aVtrying to portray me as something that I'm not,
p217
aVsome kind of thug or gangster, a menace to society.
p218
aVUnexpected compassion.
p219
aVWow.
p220
aVNow, listen,
p221
aVthe historical source of the demonization of black males and white males
p222
aVis highly different,
p223
aVand where you fall on this argument,
p224
aVsadly, tends to be an accident of birth.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, you're probably surprised by this perspective,
p227
aVand so was I.
p228
aVNever in a billion years did I think that I could have some kind of compassion
p229
aVfor people who hated my guts.
p230
aVNow, mind you, not enough compassion like I want to be friends.
p231
aVI don't have infinite olive branches to extend to people
p232
aVwho, like, would not want to see me on this planet. Right?
p233
aVBut just enough compassion to understand how they got to where they are.
p234
aVAnd to be honest,
p235
aVthere were a couple of fair points.
p236
aVOne of them was how liberals have this wide acceptance for everybody
p237
aVexcept for those with honestly held conservative viewpoints.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VHeaven forbid you love God, this country and mean it. Right?
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd another thing that they talked about was this fear that they had
p244
aVof something that they labeled as "white genocide,"
p245
aVthat diversity would be a force that would wipe them out.
p246
aVNow listen, I know what it is to fear
p247
aVfor the fate of your people.
p248
aVBetween crack, AIDS, gang violence,
p249
aVmass incarceration, gentrification, police shootings,
p250
aVblack people have more than enough reasons to stay up at night.
p251
aVBut if nature is into diversity and you are not,
p252
aVyou're going to lose that fight, buddy.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VYou see, nature doesn't care about your race. That's man-made.
p259
aVNature just cares about healthy organisms,
p260
aVand your precious ethnic features are expendable to that aim.
p261
aVSo the moment that you let go of that racist identity
p262
aVand relatch onto humanity,
p263
aVall your problems go away.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VI'm going to tell you what race ain't about to die out:
p268
aVthe human race.
p269
aVJoin the party. The water's great.
p270
aVUntil the water gets too hot, but that's another TED Talk.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VThe point is that to get to this point of understanding,
p275
aVyou have to let go of that fear
p276
aVand embrace your curiosity,
p277
aVand sadly, too many people will not take that journey
p278
aVto see the world from the other side.
p279
aVAnd, I mean, let's be honest,
p280
aVthat doesn't just go for progressives,
p281
aVbut also to the right wing and conservatives.
p282
aVYou know, as fair as some of their points were,
p283
aVthey were still trapped in their own echo chambers,
p284
aVrecycling old, outdated points of view,
p285
aVnever getting a diversity in perspective,
p286
aVnot making them well-rounded in their worldview.
p287
aVSo they're not hearing certain anti-racist and political voices,
p288
aVvoices like Tim Wise
p289
aVand Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.
p290
aVAll of these voices have the answers to the questions that they want,
p291
aVbut unfortunately they will not hear them due to the power of these echo chambers.
p292
aVWe have got to break out of these digital divides,
p293
aVbecause as our technology advances,
p294
aVthe consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd this whole experience taught me something:
p297
aVour gadgets ain't going to save us.
p298
aVAll these technological devices
p299
aVare only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here.
p300
aVAnd so that's all IQ, not EQ.
p301
aVThat's a dangerous imbalance.
p302
aVWhere do you get the emotional intelligence,
p303
aVthe character development,
p304
aVthe virtues of patience, forbearance, compassion,
p305
aVyou know, the things that make sure that these devices, however advanced,
p306
aVbecome a blessing and not a curse?
p307
aVSeems to be me that humanity itself needs an upgrade.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow \u2014
p310
aa(lp311
V(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VThat's a big task, understandably,
p314
aVbut I don't believe in any kind of unbeatable monster.
p315
aVThere was no giant out there without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.
p316
aVAnd what if I told you
p317
aVthat one of the best ways to actually overcome this
p318
aVis to have courageous conversations
p319
aVwith difficult people,
p320
aVpeople who do not see the world the same way that you see the world?
p321
aVOh yes, folks, conversations may be indeed the key to that upgrade,
p322
aVbecause remember,
p323
aVlanguage was the first form of virtual reality.
p324
aVIt is literally a symbolic representation of the physical world,
p325
aVand through this device, we change the physical world.
p326
aVKeep in mind, conversations stop violence,
p327
aVconversations start countries,
p328
aVthey build bridges,
p329
aVand when the chips are down,
p330
aVconversations are the last tools that humans use
p331
aVbefore they pick up their guns.
p332
aVAnd I ain't talking about online safe conversations
p333
aVfrom the security of your laptop.
p334
aVNo.
p335
aVI'm talking about in-your-face conversations with real, breathing people.
p336
aVAnd for me, this looks like running a community forum
p337
aVcalled Shop Talk Live.
p338
aa(lp339
VNow, in Shop Talk Live \u2014 somebody's been there, right?
p340
aVIn Shop Talk Live,
p341
aVwe have the conversations that change lives.
p342
aVWe meet the community right where they are,
p343
aVand we've done everything from divert gang violence in real time
p344
aVto help find people jobs
p345
aVto mentoring homeless youth.
p346
aVAnd the reason why we needed to do this
p347
aVis because there was a severe lack of trust in the black community
p348
aVdue to the violence of the crack era.
p349
aVAnd so we ended up taking agency into our own hands,
p350
aVsolving our own problems,
p351
aVnot waiting for anybody else.
p352
aVAnd the truth is,
p353
aVfrom the mayor to the felon,
p354
aVyou're going to find them in that barber shop.
p355
aVAnd so what we did was just organize what was already going on.
p356
aVAnd so what I started doing was mining these alternative viewpoints
p357
aVfrom these alternative digital universes,
p358
aVdissecting them, breaking them down into controversial talking points.
p359
aVThen, with my cell phone,
p360
aVI flipped the internet against itself
p361
aVand began to broadcast these live conversations
p362
aVto my online followers.
p363
aVThis made them want to leave the safety of their laptops
p364
aVand meet us in person to have real conversations
p365
aVwith real people in real life.
p366
aVAnd we did this. Thank you.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Applause)
p369
aa(lp370
VSometimes I sit back, and I reflect on the paradox
p371
aVof me just trying to solve the problems,
p372
aVus trying to solve the problems in our own communities \u2014
p373
aVwe build bridges to so many other communities,
p374
aVfrom the LGBTQ community to the Arab immigrant community
p375
aVand even sat down with somebody with a Confederate flag on their hat
p376
aVand talked about the things that actually matter.
p377
aa(lp378
VIt is time that we stop trying
p379
aVto hack our way around the human experience.
p380
aVThere is no way out of each other.
p381
aVStop trying to find one.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VWe have to understand something.
p386
aVHuman beings all want the same things
p387
aVand we have to go through each other to get these things.
p388
aVThese courageous conversations are the way that these bridges are built.
p389
aVIt's time that we start seeing people as people
p390
aVand not simply the ideas that we project onto them or react to.
p391
aVHuman beings are not the barriers
p392
aVbut the gateways to the very things that we want.
p393
aVThis is a collective and conscious evolution.
p394
aa(lp395
VMy journey began with a terribly popular cell phone video
p396
aVand a fallen friend.
p397
aVYour journey begins right about now.
p398
aVJoin the renaissance in human connection.
p399
aVIt is going to happen with or without you.
p400
aVMy suggestion: pick a topic, and start a community dialogue
p401
aVin your neck of the woods.
p402
aVMeet folks back in real life.
p403
aVAnd I'm going to tell you,
p404
aVwhen you trick the algorithm of your existence,
p405
aVyou will get some diversified experiences.
p406
aVIt is time to grow, people.
p407
aVAnd when we do this, not if,
p408
aVit will be clear that the key to this upgrade
p409
aVwas always our inner world, not some device that we create,
p410
aVand the doorways to this experience is now,
p411
aVand will forever be, each other.
p412
aa(lp413
VThank you.
