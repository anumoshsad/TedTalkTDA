VIt's an amazing thing
p4
aVthat we're here to talk about the year of patients rising.
p5
aVYou heard stories earlier today
p6
aVabout patients who are taking control of their cases,
p7
aVpatients who are saying,
p8
aV"You know what, I know what the odds are,
p9
aVbut I'm going to look for more information.
p10
aVI'm going to define what the terms of my success are."
p11
aVI'm going to be sharing with you how, four years ago, I almost died \u2014
p12
aVfound out I was, in fact, already almost dead \u2014
p13
aVand what I then found out
p14
aVabout what's called the e-Patient movement.
p15
aVI'll explain what that term means.
p16
aVI had been blogging under the name "Patient Dave,"
p17
aVand when I discovered this,
p18
aVI just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.
p19
aa(lp20
VRegarding the word "patient":
p21
aVWhen I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care
p22
aVand attending meetings as just a casual observer,
p23
aVI noticed that people would talk about patients
p24
aVas if it was somebody who's not in the room here \u2014
p25
aVsomebody out there.
p26
aVSome of our talks today, we still act like that.
p27
aVBut I'm here to tell you:
p28
aV"patient" is not a third-person word.
p29
aVAll right?
p30
aVYou yourself will find yourself in a hospital bed \u2014
p31
aVor your mother, your child \u2014
p32
aVthere are heads nodding, people who say,
p33
aV"Yes, I know exactly what you mean."
p34
aa(lp35
VSo when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today,
p36
aVfirst of all, I want to say that I am here
p37
aVon behalf of all the patients that I have ever met,
p38
aVall the ones I haven't met.
p39
aVThis is about letting patients play a more active role
p40
aVin helping health care, in fixing health care.
p41
aVOne of the senior doctors at my hospital,
p42
aVCharlie Safran, and his colleague, Warner Slack,
p43
aVhave been saying for decades
p44
aVthat the most underutilized resource in all of health care
p45
aVis the patient.
p46
aVThey have been saying that since the 1970s.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, I'm going to step back in history.
p49
aVThis is from July, 1969.
p50
aVI was a freshman in college,
p51
aVand this was when we first landed on the Moon.
p52
aVAnd it was the first time
p53
aVwe had ever seen from another surface \u2014
p54
aVthat's the place where you and I are right now,
p55
aVwhere we live.
p56
aVThe world was changing.
p57
aVIt was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee.
p58
aVA few weeks later, Woodstock happened.
p59
aVThree days of fun and music.
p60
aVHere, just for historical authenticity,
p61
aVis a picture of me in that year.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VYeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes \u2014
p66
aVit was really something.
p67
aa(lp68
VThat fall of 1969,
p69
aVthe Whole Earth Catalog came out.
p70
aVIt was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency.
p71
aVWe think of hippies of being just hedonists,
p72
aVbut there's a very strong component \u2014 I was in that movement \u2014
p73
aVa very strong component of being responsible for yourself.
p74
aVThis book's title's subtitle is "Access to Tools."
p75
aVIt talked about how to build your own house,
p76
aVhow to grow your own food, all kinds of things.
p77
aVIn the 1980s,
p78
aVthis young doctor, Tom Ferguson,
p79
aVwas the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog.
p80
aVHe saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care
p81
aVis taking care of ourselves.
p82
aVIn fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent
p83
aVof how we actually take care of our bodies.
p84
aVWell, he also saw that when health care turns to medical care
p85
aVbecause of a more serious disease,
p86
aVthe key thing that holds us back is access to information.
p87
aVAnd when the Web came along, that changed everything,
p88
aVbecause not only could we find information,
p89
aVwe could find other people like ourselves
p90
aVwho could gather, who could bring us information.
p91
aVAnd he coined this term "e-Patients" \u2014
p92
aVequipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.
p93
aVObviously, at this stage of life
p94
aVhe was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term.
p97
aVIn 2006, I went to my doctor for a regular physical,
p98
aVand I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."
p99
aVWell, I got an X-ray,
p100
aVand the next morning \u2014
p101
aVyou may have noticed, those of you who have been through a medical crisis
p102
aVwill understand this.
p103
aVThis morning, some of the speakers named the date when they found out
p104
aVabout their condition.
p105
aVFor me, it was 9am
p106
aVon January 3, 2007.
p107
aVI was at the office; my desk was clean.
p108
aVI had the blue partition carpet on the walls.
p109
aVThe phone rang and it was my doctor.
p110
aVHe said, "Dave, I pulled up the X-ray image
p111
aVon the screen on the computer at home."
p112
aVHe said, "Your shoulder is going to be fine,
p113
aVbut Dave, there's something in your lung."
p114
aVAnd if you look in that red oval,
p115
aVthat shadow was not supposed to be there.
p116
aVTo make a long story short,
p117
aVI said, "So you need me to get back in there?"
p118
aVHe said, "Yeah, we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest."
p119
aVIn parting, I said, "Is there anything I should do?"
p120
aVHe said \u2014 think about this one,
p121
aVthis is the advice your doctor gives you:
p122
aV"Just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife."
p123
aa(lp124
VI went in for the CAT scan.
p125
aVIt turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs.
p126
aVSo at that point we knew that it was cancer.
p127
aVWe knew it wasn't lung cancer.
p128
aVThat meant it was metastasized from somewhere.
p129
aVThe question was, where from?
p130
aVSo I went in for an ultrasound.
p131
aVI got to do what many women have \u2014
p132
aVthe jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!"
p133
aVMy wife came with me.
p134
aVShe's a veterinarian,
p135
aVso she's seen lots of ultrasounds.
p136
aVI mean, she knows I'm not a dog.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VThis is an MRI image.
p141
aVThis is much sharper than an ultrasound would be.
p142
aVWhat we saw in that kidney
p143
aVwas that big blob there.
p144
aVThere were actually two of these: one was growing out the front
p145
aVand had already erupted and latched onto the bowel.
p146
aVOne was growing out the back and it attached to the psoas muscle,
p147
aVwhich is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of,
p148
aVbut all of a sudden I cared about it.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VI went home.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, I've been Googling \u2014
p155
aVI've been online since 1989, on CompuServe.
p156
aVI went home, and I know you can't read the details here;
p157
aVthat's not important.
p158
aVMy point is, I went to a respected medical website, WebMD,
p159
aVbecause I know how to filter out junk.
p160
aVI also found my wife online.
p161
aVBefore I met her,
p162
aVI went through some suboptimal search results.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VSo I looked for quality information.
p167
aVThere's so much about trust \u2014
p168
aVwhat sources of information can we trust?
p169
aVWhere does my body end and an invader start?
p170
aVA cancer, a tumor, is something you grow out of your own tissue.
p171
aVHow does that happen?
p172
aVWhere does medical ability end and start?
p173
aVWell, so what I read on WebMD:
p174
aV"The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer.
p175
aVAlmost all patients are incurable."
p176
aVI've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get,
p177
aVI go look for more.
p178
aVAnd what I found on other websites was,
p179
aVeven by the third page of Google results:
p180
aV"Outlook is bleak."
p181
aV"Prognosis is grim."
p182
aVAnd I'm thinking, "What the heck?"
p183
aVI didn't feel sick at all.
p184
aVI mean, I'd been getting tired in the evening,
p185
aVbut I was 56 years old, you know?
p186
aVI was slowly losing weight,
p187
aVbut for me, that was what the doctor told me to do.
p188
aVIt was really something.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd this is the diagram of stage 4 kidney cancer
p191
aVfrom the drug I eventually got.
p192
aVTotally by coincidence, there's that thing in my lung.
p193
aVIn the left femur, the left thigh bone, there's another one.
p194
aVI had one. My leg eventually snapped.
p195
aVI fainted and landed on it, and it broke.
p196
aVThere's one in the skull,
p197
aVand then for good measure, I had these other tumors,
p198
aVincluding, by the time my treatment started,
p199
aVone was growing out of my tongue.
p200
aVI had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue.
p201
aVAnd what I read
p202
aVwas that my median survival was 24 weeks.
p203
aVThis was bad.
p204
aVI was facing the grave.
p205
aVI thought, "What's my mother's face going to look like
p206
aVon the day of my funeral?"
p207
aVI had to sit down with my daughter and say, "Here's the situation."
p208
aVHer boyfriend was with her.
p209
aVI said, "I don't want you guys to get married prematurely,
p210
aVjust so you can do it while Dad's still alive."
p211
aVIt's really serious.
p212
aVIf you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help,
p213
aVthink about this.
p214
aa(lp215
VWell, my doctor prescribed a patient community, ACOR.org,
p216
aVa network of cancer patients, of all amazing things.
p217
aVVery quickly they told me,
p218
aV"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.
p219
aVGet yourself to a specialist center.
p220
aVThere is no cure, but there's something that sometimes works \u2014
p221
aVit usually doesn't \u2014
p222
aVcalled high-dosage interleukin.
p223
aVMost hospitals don't offer it,
p224
aVso they won't even tell you it exists.
p225
aVDon't let them give you anything else first.
p226
aVAnd by the way, here are four doctors in your part of the United States
p227
aVwho offer it, and their phone numbers."
p228
aVHow amazing is that?
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VHere's the thing:
p233
aVHere we are, four years later \u2014
p234
aVyou can't find a website that gives patients that information.
p235
aVGovernment-approved, American Cancer Society,
p236
aVbut patients know what patients want to know.
p237
aVIt's the power of patient networks.
p238
aVThis amazing substance \u2014 again, I mentioned:
p239
aVWhere does my body end?
p240
aVMy oncologist and I talk a lot these days
p241
aVbecause I try to keep my talks technically accurate.
p242
aVAnd he said, "You know, the immune system is good at detecting invaders,
p243
aVbacteria coming from outside,
p244
aVbut when it's your own tissue that you've grown,
p245
aVit's a whole different thing."
p246
aVAnd I went through a mental exercise, actually,
p247
aVbecause I started a patient support community of my own on a website,
p248
aVand one of my friends \u2014 one of my relatives, actually \u2014 said,
p249
aV"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?
p250
aVAre you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself?"
p251
aVSo we went into it.
p252
aVThe story of how all that happened is in the book.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnyway, this is the way the numbers unfolded.
p255
aVMe being me, I put the numbers from my hospital's website,
p256
aVfor my tumor sizes,
p257
aVinto a spreadsheet.
p258
aVDon't worry about the numbers.
p259
aVYou see, that's the immune system.
p260
aVAmazing thing, those two yellow lines
p261
aVare where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart.
p262
aVAnd look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between.
p263
aVJust incredible.
p264
aVWho knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it?
p265
aa(lp266
VThe punch line is that a year and a half later,
p267
aVI was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter,
p268
aVgot married.
p269
aVAnd when she came down those steps,
p270
aVand it was just her and me for that moment,
p271
aVI was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother,
p272
aV"I wish Dad could have been here."
p273
aVAnd this is what we're doing when we make health care better.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients
p276
aVwho are doing everything in their power to improve health care.
p277
aVThis is Regina Holliday,
p278
aVa painter in Washington DC, whose husband died of kidney cancer
p279
aVa year after my disease.
p280
aVShe's painting, here, a mural
p281
aVof his horrible final weeks in the hospital.
p282
aVOne of the things that she discovered
p283
aVwas that her husband's medical record in this paper folder
p284
aVwas just disorganized.
p285
aVAnd she thought, "You know, if I have a nutrition facts label
p286
aVon the side of a cereal box,
p287
aVwhy can't there be something that simple
p288
aVtelling every new nurse who comes on duty,
p289
aVevery new doctor,
p290
aVthe basics about my husband's condition?"
p291
aVSo she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label,
p292
aVsomething like that,
p293
aVin a diagram of him.
p294
aVShe then, last year, painted this diagram.
p295
aa(lp296
VShe studied health care like me.
p297
aVShe came to realize there were a lot of people
p298
aVwho'd written patient-advocate books
p299
aVthat you just don't hear about at medical conferences.
p300
aVPatients are such an underutilized resource.
p301
aVWell, as it said in my introduction,
p302
aVI've gotten somewhat known for saying
p303
aVthat patients should have access to their data.
p304
aVI actually said at one conference a couple of years ago,
p305
aV"Give me my damn data,
p306
aVbecause you people can't be trusted to keep it clean."
p307
aVAnd here, she has our "damned" data \u2014
p308
aVit's a pun \u2014
p309
aVwhich is starting to break out, starting to break through \u2014
p310
aVthe water symbolizes our data.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd in fact,
p313
aVI want to do a little something improvisational for you.
p314
aVThere's a guy on Twitter that I know, a health IT guy outside Boston,
p315
aVand he wrote the e-Patient rap.
p316
aVAnd it goes like this.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
V(Beatboxing)
p321
aa(lp322
V(Rapping) Gimme my damn data
p323
aVI wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave
p324
aVGimme my damn data, 'cause it's my life to save
p325
aV(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going to go any further \u2014
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p328
aa(lp329
VWell, thank you. That shot the timing.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VThink about the possibility.
p334
aVWhy is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster
p335
aVthan the health tools that are available to you
p336
aVto help take care of your family?
p337
aVHere's a website, VisibleBody.com, that I stumbled across.
p338
aVAnd I thought, "You know, I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"
p339
aVSo you can click on things and remove it.
p340
aVAnd I saw, "Aha! That's the kidney and the psoas muscle."
p341
aVI was rotating it in 3D and saying, "I understand now."
p342
aVAnd then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth,
p343
aVwhere you can fly to any address.
p344
aVAnd I thought, "Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data
p345
aVand have Google Earth for my body?"
p346
aVWhat did Google come out with this year?
p347
aVNow there's Google Body browser.
p348
aVBut you see, it's still generic.
p349
aVIt's not my data.
p350
aVBut if we can get that data out from behind the dam
p351
aVso software innovators can pounce on it
p352
aVthe way software innovators like to do,
p353
aVwho knows what we'll be able to come up with.
p354
aa(lp355
VOne final story.
p356
aVThis is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida.
p357
aVThis is a live story, unfolding just in the last few weeks.
p358
aVRA patients, as they call themselves \u2014 her blog is "RA Warrior" \u2014
p359
aVhave a big problem,
p360
aVbecause 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms.
p361
aVAnd that makes it really hard to tell how the disease is going,
p362
aVand some doctors think, "Yeah right, you're really in pain."
p363
aVWell, she found, through her online research,
p364
aVa nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer,
p365
aVbut it can also reveal inflammation.
p366
aVAnd she saw that if there is no inflammation,
p367
aVthen the scan is a uniform gray.
p368
aVSo she took it.
p369
aVAnd the radiologist's report said, "No cancer found."
p370
aVWell, that's not what he was supposed to do with it.
p371
aVSo she wanted to have it read again,
p372
aVand her doctor fired her.
p373
aVShe pulled up the CD.
p374
aVHe said, "If you don't want to follow my instructions, go away."
p375
aVSo she pulled up the CD of the scan images,
p376
aVand look at all those hot spots.
p377
aVAnd she's now actively engaged on her blog
p378
aVin looking for assistance in getting better care.
p379
aVSee, that is an empowered patient \u2014 no medical training.
p380
aa(lp381
VWe are, you are,
p382
aVthe most underused resource in health care.
p383
aVWhat she was able to do
p384
aVwas because she had access to the raw data.
p385
aVHow big a deal was this?
p386
aVWell at TED2009,
p387
aVTim Berners-Lee himself, inventor of the Web,
p388
aVgave a talk where he said the next big thing
p389
aVis not to have your browser find other people's articles about the data,
p390
aVbut the raw data.
p391
aVAnd he got them chanting by the end of the talk,
p392
aV"Raw data now! Raw data now!"
p393
aVAnd I ask you,
p394
aVthree words, please, to improve health care:
p395
aVLet patients help!
p396
aVLet patients help!
p397
aVLet patients help!
p398
aVLet patients help!
p399
aa(lp400
VThank you.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Applause)
p403
aa(lp404
VFor all the patients around the world watching this on the Webcast,
p405
aVGod bless you, everyone. Let patients help.
p406
aa(lp407
VHost: And bless yourself. Thank you very much.
