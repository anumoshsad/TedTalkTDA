VToday, I'm going to take you
p4
aVaround the world in 18 minutes.
p5
aVMy base of operations is in the U.S.,
p6
aVbut let's start at the other end of the map,
p7
aVin Kyoto, Japan,
p8
aVwhere I was living with a Japanese family
p9
aVwhile I was doing part of my dissertational research
p10
aV15 years ago.
p11
aVI knew even then that I would encounter
p12
aVcultural differences and misunderstandings,
p13
aVbut they popped up when I least expected it.
p14
aa(lp15
VOn my first day,
p16
aVI went to a restaurant,
p17
aVand I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.
p18
aVAfter a pause, the waiter said,
p19
aV"One does not put sugar in green tea."
p20
aV"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
p21
aVBut I really like my tea sweet."
p22
aVIn response, he gave me an even more courteous version
p23
aVof the same explanation.
p24
aV"One does not put sugar
p25
aVin green tea."
p26
aV"I understand," I said,
p27
aV"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,
p28
aVbut I'd like to put some sugar
p29
aVin my green tea."
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVSurprised by my insistence,
p32
aVthe waiter took up the issue with the manager.
p33
aVPretty soon,
p34
aVa lengthy discussion ensued,
p35
aVand finally the manager came over to me and said,
p36
aV"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVWell, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,
p39
aVI ordered a cup of coffee,
p40
aVwhich the waiter brought over promptly.
p41
aVResting on the saucer
p42
aVwere two packets of sugar.
p43
aa(lp44
VMy failure to procure myself
p45
aVa cup of sweet, green tea
p46
aVwas not due to a simple misunderstanding.
p47
aVThis was due to a fundamental difference
p48
aVin our ideas about choice.
p49
aVFrom my American perspective,
p50
aVwhen a paying customer makes a reasonable request
p51
aVbased on her preferences,
p52
aVshe has every right to have that request met.
p53
aVThe American way, to quote Burger King,
p54
aVis to "have it your way,"
p55
aVbecause, as Starbucks says,
p56
aV"happiness is in your choices."
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVBut from the Japanese perspective,
p59
aVit's their duty to protect those who don't know any better \u2014
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVin this case, the ignorant gaijin \u2014
p62
aVfrom making the wrong choice.
p63
aVLet's face it: the way I wanted my tea
p64
aVwas inappropriate according to cultural standards,
p65
aVand they were doing their best to help me save face.
p66
aa(lp67
VAmericans tend to believe
p68
aVthat they've reached some sort of pinnacle
p69
aVin the way they practice choice.
p70
aVThey think that choice, as seen through the American lens
p71
aVbest fulfills an innate and universal
p72
aVdesire for choice in all humans.
p73
aVUnfortunately,
p74
aVthese beliefs are based on assumptions
p75
aVthat don't always hold true
p76
aVin many countries, in many cultures.
p77
aVAt times they don't even hold true
p78
aVat America's own borders.
p79
aVI'd like to discuss some of these assumptions
p80
aVand the problems associated with them.
p81
aVAs I do so, I hope you'll start thinking
p82
aVabout some of your own assumptions
p83
aVand how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
p84
aa(lp85
VFirst assumption:
p86
aVif a choice affects you,
p87
aVthen you should be the one to make it.
p88
aVThis is the only way to ensure
p89
aVthat your preferences and interests
p90
aVwill be most fully accounted for.
p91
aVIt is essential for success.
p92
aVIn America, the primary locus of choice
p93
aVis the individual.
p94
aVPeople must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,
p95
aVregardless of what other people want or recommend.
p96
aVIt's called "being true to yourself."
p97
aVBut do all individuals benefit
p98
aVfrom taking such an approach to choice?
p99
aVMark Lepper and I did a series of studies
p100
aVin which we sought the answer to this very question.
p101
aVIn one study,
p102
aVwhich we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,
p103
aVwe brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children
p104
aVinto the laboratory,
p105
aVand we divided them up into three groups.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe first group came in,
p108
aVand they were greeted by Miss Smith,
p109
aVwho showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
p110
aVThe kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,
p111
aVand they even got to choose which marker
p112
aVthey would write their answers with.
p113
aVWhen the second group of children came in,
p114
aVthey were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,
p115
aVbut this time Miss Smith told them
p116
aVwhich anagrams to do
p117
aVand which markers to write their answers with.
p118
aVNow when the third group came in,
p119
aVthey were told that their anagrams and their markers
p120
aVhad been chosen by their mothers.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVIn reality,
p123
aVthe kids who were told what to do,
p124
aVwhether by Miss Smith or their mothers,
p125
aVwere actually given the very same activity,
p126
aVwhich their counterparts in the first group
p127
aVhad freely chosen.
p128
aa(lp129
VWith this procedure, we were able to ensure
p130
aVthat the kids across the three groups
p131
aVall did the same activity,
p132
aVmaking it easier for us to compare performance.
p133
aVSuch small differences in the way we administered the activity
p134
aVyielded striking differences
p135
aVin how well they performed.
p136
aVAnglo-Americans,
p137
aVthey did two and a half times more anagrams
p138
aVwhen they got to choose them,
p139
aVas compared to when it was
p140
aVchosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.
p141
aVIt didn't matter who did the choosing,
p142
aVif the task was dictated by another,
p143
aVtheir performance suffered.
p144
aVIn fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed
p145
aVwhen they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVOne girl named Mary said,
p148
aV"You asked my mother?"
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VIn contrast,
p153
aVAsian-American children
p154
aVperformed best when they believed
p155
aVtheir mothers had made the choice,
p156
aVsecond best when they chose for themselves,
p157
aVand least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.
p158
aVA girl named Natsumi
p159
aVeven approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room
p160
aVand tugged on her skirt and asked,
p161
aV"Could you please tell my mommy
p162
aVI did it just like she said?"
p163
aVThe first-generation children were strongly influenced
p164
aVby their immigrant parents'
p165
aVapproach to choice.
p166
aVFor them, choice was not just a way
p167
aVof defining and asserting
p168
aVtheir individuality,
p169
aVbut a way to create community and harmony
p170
aVby deferring to the choices
p171
aVof people whom they trusted and respected.
p172
aVIf they had a concept of being true to one's self,
p173
aVthen that self, most likely,
p174
aV[was] composed, not of an individual,
p175
aVbut of a collective.
p176
aVSuccess was just as much about pleasing key figures
p177
aVas it was about satisfying
p178
aVone's own preferences.
p179
aVOr, you could say that
p180
aVthe individual's preferences were shaped
p181
aVby the preferences of specific others.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe assumption then that we do best
p184
aVwhen the individual self chooses
p185
aVonly holds
p186
aVwhen that self
p187
aVis clearly divided from others.
p188
aVWhen, in contrast,
p189
aVtwo or more individuals
p190
aVsee their choices and their outcomes
p191
aVas intimately connected,
p192
aVthen they may amplify one another's success
p193
aVby turning choosing
p194
aVinto a collective act.
p195
aVTo insist that they choose independently
p196
aVmight actually compromise
p197
aVboth their performance
p198
aVand their relationships.
p199
aVYet that is exactly what
p200
aVthe American paradigm demands.
p201
aVIt leaves little room for interdependence
p202
aVor an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
p203
aVIt requires that everyone treat choice
p204
aVas a private and self-defining act.
p205
aVPeople that have grown up in such a paradigm
p206
aVmight find it motivating,
p207
aVbut it is a mistake to assume
p208
aVthat everyone thrives under the pressure
p209
aVof choosing alone.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe second assumption which informs the American view of choice
p212
aVgoes something like this.
p213
aVThe more choices you have,
p214
aVthe more likely you are
p215
aVto make the best choice.
p216
aVSo bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,
p217
aVand Amazon, with 27 million books
p218
aVand Match.com with \u2014 what is it? \u2014
p219
aV15 million date possibilities now.
p220
aVYou will surely find the perfect match.
p221
aVLet's test this assumption
p222
aVby heading over to Eastern Europe.
p223
aVHere, I interviewed people
p224
aVwho were residents of formerly communist countries,
p225
aVwho had all faced the challenge
p226
aVof transitioning to a more
p227
aVdemocratic and capitalistic society.
p228
aVOne of the most interesting revelations
p229
aVcame not from an answer to a question,
p230
aVbut from a simple gesture of hospitality.
p231
aVWhen the participants arrived for their interview,
p232
aVI offered them a set of drinks:
p233
aVCoke, Diet Coke, Sprite \u2014
p234
aVseven, to be exact.
p235
aa(lp236
VDuring the very first session,
p237
aVwhich was run in Russia,
p238
aVone of the participants made a comment
p239
aVthat really caught me off guard.
p240
aV"Oh, but it doesn't matter.
p241
aVIt's all just soda. That's just one choice."
p242
aV(Murmuring)
p243
aVI was so struck by this comment that from then on,
p244
aVI started to offer all the participants
p245
aVthose seven sodas,
p246
aVand I asked them, "How many choices are these?"
p247
aVAgain and again,
p248
aVthey perceived these seven different sodas,
p249
aVnot as seven choices, but as one choice:
p250
aVsoda or no soda.
p251
aVWhen I put out juice and water
p252
aVin addition to these seven sodas,
p253
aVnow they perceived it as only three choices \u2014
p254
aVjuice, water and soda.
p255
aVCompare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,
p256
aVnot just to a particular flavor of soda,
p257
aVbut to a particular brand.
p258
aVYou know, research shows repeatedly
p259
aVthat we can't actually tell the difference
p260
aVbetween Coke and Pepsi.
p261
aVOf course, you and I know
p262
aVthat Coke is the better choice.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VFor modern Americans who are exposed
p267
aVto more options and more ads associated with options
p268
aVthan anyone else in the world,
p269
aVchoice is just as much about who they are
p270
aVas it is about what the product is.
p271
aVCombine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,
p272
aVand you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters
p273
aVand so every choice matters.
p274
aVBut for Eastern Europeans,
p275
aVthe sudden availability of all these
p276
aVconsumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.
p277
aVThey were flooded with choice
p278
aVbefore they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.
p279
aVWhen asked, "What words and images
p280
aVdo you associate with choice?"
p281
aVGrzegorz from Warsaw said,
p282
aV"Ah, for me it is fear.
p283
aVThere are some dilemmas you see.
p284
aVI am used to no choice."
p285
aVBohdan from Kiev said,
p286
aVin response to how he felt about
p287
aVthe new consumer marketplace,
p288
aV"It is too much.
p289
aVWe do not need everything that is there."
p290
aVA sociologist from
p291
aVthe Warsaw Survey Agency explained,
p292
aV"The older generation jumped from nothing
p293
aVto choice all around them.
p294
aVThey were never given a chance to learn
p295
aVhow to react."
p296
aVAnd Tomasz, a young Polish man said,
p297
aV"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.
p298
aVI don't mean to say that I want no choice,
p299
aVbut many of these choices are quite artificial."
p300
aa(lp301
VIn reality, many choices are between things
p302
aVthat are not that much different.
p303
aVThe value of choice
p304
aVdepends on our ability
p305
aVto perceive differences
p306
aVbetween the options.
p307
aVAmericans train their whole lives
p308
aVto play "spot the difference."
p309
aVThey practice this from such an early age
p310
aVthat they've come to believe that everyone
p311
aVmust be born with this ability.
p312
aVIn fact, though all humans share
p313
aVa basic need and desire for choice,
p314
aVwe don't all see choice in the same places
p315
aVor to the same extent.
p316
aVWhen someone can't see how one choice
p317
aVis unlike another,
p318
aVor when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,
p319
aVthe process of choosing can be
p320
aVconfusing and frustrating.
p321
aVInstead of making better choices,
p322
aVwe become overwhelmed by choice,
p323
aVsometimes even afraid of it.
p324
aVChoice no longer offers opportunities,
p325
aVbut imposes constraints.
p326
aVIt's not a marker of liberation,
p327
aVbut of suffocation
p328
aVby meaningless minutiae.
p329
aVIn other words,
p330
aVchoice can develop into the very opposite
p331
aVof everything it represents
p332
aVin America
p333
aVwhen it is thrust upon those
p334
aVwho are insufficiently prepared for it.
p335
aVBut it is not only other people
p336
aVin other places
p337
aVthat are feeling the pressure
p338
aVof ever-increasing choice.
p339
aVAmericans themselves are discovering
p340
aVthat unlimited choice
p341
aVseems more attractive in theory
p342
aVthan in practice.
p343
aa(lp344
VWe all have physical, mental
p345
aVand emotional (Laughter) limitations
p346
aVthat make it impossible for us
p347
aVto process every single choice we encounter,
p348
aVeven in the grocery store,
p349
aVlet alone over the course of our entire lives.
p350
aVA number of my studies have shown
p351
aVthat when you give people 10 or more options
p352
aVwhen they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,
p353
aVwhether it be health care, investment,
p354
aVother critical areas.
p355
aVYet still, many of us believe
p356
aVthat we should make all our own choices
p357
aVand seek out even more of them.
p358
aa(lp359
VThis brings me to the third,
p360
aVand perhaps most problematic, assumption:
p361
aV"You must never
p362
aVsay no to choice."
p363
aVTo examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
p364
aVand then hop across the pond to France.
p365
aVRight outside Chicago,
p366
aVa young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,
p367
aVwere about to have their first baby.
p368
aVThey'd already picked out a name for her,
p369
aVBarbara, after her grandmother.
p370
aVOne night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,
p371
aVshe started to experience contractions
p372
aVand was rushed to the emergency room.
p373
aVThe baby was delivered through a C-section,
p374
aVbut Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,
p375
aVa loss of oxygen to the brain.
p376
aVUnable to breathe on her own,
p377
aVshe was put on a ventilator.
p378
aVTwo days later,
p379
aVthe doctors gave the Mitchells
p380
aVa choice:
p381
aVThey could either remove Barbara
p382
aVoff the life support,
p383
aVin which case she would die within a matter of hours,
p384
aVor they could keep her on life support,
p385
aVin which case she might still die
p386
aVwithin a matter of days.
p387
aVIf she survived, she would remain
p388
aVin a permanent vegetative state,
p389
aVnever able to walk, talk
p390
aVor interact with others.
p391
aVWhat do they do?
p392
aVWhat do any parent do?
p393
aa(lp394
VIn a study I conducted
p395
aVwith Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,
p396
aVAmerican and French parents
p397
aVwere interviewed.
p398
aVThey had all suffered
p399
aVthe same tragedy.
p400
aVIn all cases, the life support was removed,
p401
aVand the infants had died.
p402
aVBut there was a big difference.
p403
aVIn France, the doctors decided whether and when
p404
aVthe life support would be removed,
p405
aVwhile in the United States,
p406
aVthe final decision rested with the parents.
p407
aVWe wondered:
p408
aVdoes this have an effect on how the parents
p409
aVcope with the loss of their loved one?
p410
aVWe found that it did.
p411
aVEven up to a year later,
p412
aVAmerican parents
p413
aVwere more likely to express negative emotions,
p414
aVas compared to their French counterparts.
p415
aVFrench parents were more likely to say things like,
p416
aV"Noah was here for so little time,
p417
aVbut he taught us so much.
p418
aVHe gave us a new perspective on life."
p419
aa(lp420
VAmerican parents were more likely to say things like,
p421
aV"What if? What if?"
p422
aVAnother parent complained,
p423
aV"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.
p424
aVHow did they get me to do that?"
p425
aVAnd another parent said,
p426
aV"I feel as if I've played a role
p427
aVin an execution."
p428
aVBut when the American parents were asked
p429
aVif they would rather have had
p430
aVthe doctors make the decision,
p431
aVthey all said, "No."
p432
aVThey could not imagine
p433
aVturning that choice over to another,
p434
aVeven though having made that choice
p435
aVmade them feel trapped,
p436
aVguilty, angry.
p437
aVIn a number of cases
p438
aVthey were even clinically depressed.
p439
aVThese parents could not contemplate
p440
aVgiving up the choice,
p441
aVbecause to do so would have gone contrary
p442
aVto everything they had been taught
p443
aVand everything they had come to believe
p444
aVabout the power
p445
aVand purpose of choice.
p446
aa(lp447
VIn her essay, "The White Album,"
p448
aVJoan Didion writes,
p449
aV"We tell ourselves stories
p450
aVin order to live.
p451
aVWe interpret what we see,
p452
aVselect the most workable
p453
aVof the multiple choices.
p454
aVWe live entirely by the imposition
p455
aVof a narrative line
p456
aVupon disparate images,
p457
aVby the idea with which we have learned to freeze
p458
aVthe shifting phantasmagoria,
p459
aVwhich is our actual experience."
p460
aVThe story Americans tell,
p461
aVthe story upon which
p462
aVthe American dream depends,
p463
aVis the story of limitless choice.
p464
aVThis narrative
p465
aVpromises so much:
p466
aVfreedom, happiness,
p467
aVsuccess.
p468
aVIt lays the world at your feet and says,
p469
aV"You can have anything, everything."
p470
aVIt's a great story,
p471
aVand it's understandable why they would be reluctant
p472
aVto revise it.
p473
aVBut when you take a close look,
p474
aVyou start to see the holes,
p475
aVand you start to see that the story
p476
aVcan be told in many other ways.
p477
aa(lp478
VAmericans have so often tried to
p479
aVdisseminate their ideas of choice,
p480
aVbelieving that they will be, or ought to be,
p481
aVwelcomed with open hearts and minds.
p482
aVBut the history books and the daily news tell us
p483
aVit doesn't always work out that way.
p484
aVThe phantasmagoria,
p485
aVthe actual experience that we try to understand
p486
aVand organize through narrative,
p487
aVvaries from place to place.
p488
aVNo single narrative serves the needs
p489
aVof everyone everywhere.
p490
aVMoreover, Americans themselves
p491
aVcould benefit from incorporating
p492
aVnew perspectives into their own narrative,
p493
aVwhich has been driving their choices
p494
aVfor so long.
p495
aa(lp496
VRobert Frost once said that,
p497
aV"It is poetry that is lost in translation."
p498
aVThis suggests that
p499
aVwhatever is beautiful and moving,
p500
aVwhatever gives us a new way to see,
p501
aVcannot be communicated to those
p502
aVwho speak a different language.
p503
aVBut Joseph Brodsky said that,

aV"It is poetry
p505
aVthat is gained in translation,"
p506
aVsuggesting that translation
p507
aVcan be a creative,
p508
aVtransformative act.
p509
aVWhen it comes to choice,
p510
aVwe have far more to gain than to lose
p511
aVby engaging in the many
p512
aVtranslations of the narratives.
p513
aVInstead of replacing
p514
aVone story with another,
p515
aVwe can learn from and revel in
p516
aVthe many versions that exist
p517
aVand the many that have yet to be written.
p518
aVNo matter where we're from
p519
aVand what your narrative is,
p520
aVwe all have a responsibility
p521
aVto open ourselves up to a wider array
p522
aVof what choice can do,
p523
aVand what it can represent.
p524
aVAnd this does not lead to
p525
aVa paralyzing moral relativism.
p526
aVRather, it teaches us when
p527
aVand how to act.
p528
aVIt brings us that much closer
p529
aVto realizing the full potential of choice,
p530
aVto inspiring the hope
p531
aVand achieving the freedom
p532
aVthat choice promises
p533
aVbut doesn't always deliver.
p534
aVIf we learn to speak to one another,
p535
aValbeit through translation,
p536
aVthen we can begin to see choice
p537
aVin all its strangeness,
p538
aVcomplexity
p539
aVand compelling beauty.

VBruno Giussani: Thank you.
p546
aVSheena, there is a detail about your biography
p547
aVthat we have not written in the program book.
p548
aVBut by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
p549
aVAnd I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:
p550
aVHow does that influence your study of choosing
p551
aVbecause that's an activity
p552
aVthat for most people is associated with visual inputs
p553
aVlike aesthetics and color and so on?
p554
aa(lp555
VSheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that
p556
aVbecause one of the things that's interesting about being blind
p557
aVis you actually get a different vantage point
p558
aVwhen you observe the way
p559
aVsighted people make choices.
p560
aVAnd as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there
p561
aVthat are very visual these days.
p562
aVYeah, I \u2014 as you would expect \u2014
p563
aVget pretty frustrated by choices
p564
aVlike what nail polish to put on
p565
aVbecause I have to rely on what other people suggest.
p566
aVAnd I can't decide.
p567
aVAnd so one time I was in a beauty salon,
p568
aVand I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.
p569
aVAnd one was called "Ballet Slippers."
p570
aVAnd the other one was called "Adorable."
p571
aV(Laughter)
p572
aVAnd so I asked these two ladies,
p573
aVand the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"
p574
aV"Well, what does it look like?"
p575
aV"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."
p576
aV"Okay, great."
p577
aVThe other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."
p578
aV"What does it look like?"
p579
aV"It's a glamorous shade of pink."
p580
aVAnd so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?
p581
aVWhat's different about them?"
p582
aVAnd they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."
p583
aVOkay, we got that.
p584
aVAnd the only thing they had consensus on:
p585
aVwell, if I could see them, I would
p586
aVclearly be able to tell them apart.
p587
aa(lp588
V(Laughter)
p589
aa(lp590
VAnd what I wondered was whether they were being affected
p591
aVby the name or the content of the color,
p592
aVso I decided to do a little experiment.
p593
aVSo I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,
p594
aVand I stripped the labels off.
p595
aVAnd I brought women into the laboratory,
p596
aVand I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"
p597
aV50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,
p598
aVof putting the same color nail polish
p599
aVin both those bottles.
p600
aV(Laughter)
p601
aV(Applause)
p602
aVAt which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.
p603
aVNow, of the women that could tell them apart,
p604
aVwhen the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"
p605
aVand when the labels were on,
p606
aVthey picked "Ballet Slippers."
p607
aVSo as far as I can tell,
p608
aVa rose by any other name
p609
aVprobably does look different
p610
aVand maybe even smells different.
