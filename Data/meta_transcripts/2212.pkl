VI'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture.
p4
aa(lp5
VA hundred years ago, we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia,
p6
aVthat, if they took hold, would take us away quite quickly.
p7
aVWe tended to die at home, in our own beds, looked after by family,
p8
aValthough that was the default option
p9
aVbecause a lot of people lacked access to medical care.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd then in the 20th century a lot of things changed.
p12
aVWe developed new medicines like penicillin
p13
aVso we could treat those infectious diseases.
p14
aVNew medical technologies like x-ray machines were invented.
p15
aVAnd because they were so big and expensive,
p16
aVwe needed large, centralized buildings to keep them in,
p17
aVand they became our modern hospitals.
p18
aa(lp19
VAfter the Second World War,
p20
aVa lot of countries set up  universal healthcare systems
p21
aVso that everyone who needed treatment could get it.
p22
aVThe result was that lifespans extended from about 45 at the start of the century
p23
aVto almost double that today.
p24
aVThe 20th century was this time of huge  optimism about what science could offer,
p25
aVbut with all of the focus on life, death was forgotten,
p26
aVeven as our approach to death changed dramatically.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, I'm an architect,
p29
aVand for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes
p30
aVand at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying.
p31
aVWe now tend to die of cancer and heart disease,
p32
aVand what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness
p33
aVat the end of our lives.
p34
aVDuring that period,
p35
aVwe'll likely spend a lot of time  in hospitals and hospices and care homes.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, we've all been in a modern hospital.
p38
aVYou know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors
p39
aVand those rows of uncomfortable chairs.
p40
aVHospital architecture has earned its bad reputation.
p41
aVBut the surprising thing is, it wasn't always like this.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in 1419 by Brunelleschi,
p44
aVwho was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time.
p45
aVAnd when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today,
p46
aVwhat amazes me is this building's ambition.
p47
aVIt's just a really great building.
p48
aVIt has these courtyards in the middle
p49
aVso that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air,
p50
aVand the rooms are big and they have high ceilings,
p51
aVso they just feel more comfortable to be in.
p52
aVAnd it's also beautiful.
p53
aVSomehow, we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, if we want better buildings for dying, then we have to talk about it,
p56
aVbut because we find the subject of death uncomfortable,
p57
aVwe don't talk about it,
p58
aVand we don't question how we as a society approach death.
p59
aVOne of the things that surprised me most in my research, though,
p60
aVis how changeable attitudes actually are.
p61
aVThis is the first crematorium in the U.K.,
p62
aVwhich was built in Woking in the 1870s.
p63
aVAnd when this was first built, there were protests in the local village.
p64
aVCremation wasn't socially acceptable, and 99.8 percent of people got buried.
p65
aVAnd yet, only a hundred years later, three quarters of us get cremated.
p66
aVPeople are actually really open to changing things
p67
aVif they're given the chance to talk about them.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this conversation about death and architecture
p70
aVwas what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it
p71
aVin Venice in June, which was called "Death in Venice."
p72
aVIt was designed to be quite playful
p73
aVso that people would literally engage with it.
p74
aVThis is one of our exhibits, which is an interactive map of London
p75
aVthat shows just how much of the real estate in the city
p76
aVis given over to death and dying,
p77
aVand as you wave your hand across the map,
p78
aVthe name of that piece of real estate, the building or cemetery, is revealed.
p79
aVAnother of our exhibits was a series of postcards
p80
aVthat people could take away with them.
p81
aVAnd they showed people's homes and hospitals
p82
aVand cemeteries and mortuaries,
p83
aVand they tell the story of the different spaces
p84
aVthat we pass through on either side of death.
p85
aVWe wanted to show that where we die
p86
aVis a key part of how we die.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition,
p89
aVespecially the audio-visual works.
p90
aVWe had people dancing and running and jumping
p91
aVas they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways,
p92
aVand at a certain point they would kind of stop
p93
aVand remember that they were in an exhibition about death,
p94
aVand that maybe that's not how you're supposed to act.
p95
aVBut actually, I would question whether there is one way
p96
aVthat you're supposed to act around death,
p97
aVand if there's not, I'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is,
p98
aVand what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like,
p99
aVand mightn't it be a little less like this and a little more like this?
